380,"Effect of Protons on GABA<inf>A</inf> Receptors in Central Neurons of Various Types Whole-cell patch-clamp technique was employed to record chloride ionic current I<inf>GABA</inf> evoked by fast (600 msec) application of GABA to hippocampal pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells isolated from rat brain. GABA solution in the application pipette was either neutral (pH 7.4) or acidic (pH 7.0 or 6.0). Application of protons to neurons causes a rapid, reversible, and dose-dependent decrease in the amplitude of I<inf>GABA</inf>; the effect was more pronounced on hippocampal neurons (carrying both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA<inf>A</inf> receptors) than in cerebellar Purkinje cells (predominantly equipped with synaptic GABA<inf>A</inf> receptors). In hippocampal neurons, pharmacological isolation of extrasynaptic component from total I<inf>GABA</inf> was performed with GABA<inf>A</inf> receptor antagonist gabazine (50 nM). The extrasynaptic component of I<inf>GABA</inf> was stronger blocked by protons than total I<inf>GABA</inf>. It was concluded that acidic medium produced more potent blocking effect on extrasynaptic GABA<inf>A</inf> receptors than on synaptic ones.

1207,"[Influence of electromagnetic radiation on raf kinase inhibitor protein and its related proteins of hippocampus]. [Chinese] To study the development of changes for Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) and its mRNA in rats hippocampus after electromagnetic radiation. Rats were exposed to X-band high power microwave (X-HPM), S-band high power microwave (S-HPM) and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) radiation source respectively. The animal model of electromagnetic radiation was established. Western blot was used to detect the expression of RKIP, and RT-PCR was applied to detect the expression of RKIP mRNA. The interaction of RKIP and Raf-1 was measured with co-immunoprecipitation method, and the expression of cerebral choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) was measured by immunohistochemistry. The expression of RKIP significantly down-regulated at 6 h after radiation, and recovered at 1 d in group EMP, but the down-regulation continued during 1 approximately 7 d after radiation in the two microwave groups. The expression of RKIP mRNA changed wavily during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, which showed down-regulation at 6 h, and up-regulation at 3 d. The interaction of RKIP and Raf-1 decreased during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, most significantly at 7 d, and the two microwave groups were more significant. The expression of CHAT decreased continuously during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, and generally recovered on 14 d. The down-regulation of RKIP and its related proteins of hippocampus is induced by electromagnetic radiation.",Included,0.11853291
