Doses of 0, 0.8 or 1.6 Gy were given to the whole body. The body and brain weights, DNA and RNA contents of the brain and 3H-thymidine or H-uridine incorporated by the brain were measured at 5, 10, or 15 days after birth. A dose of 1.6 Gy produced alterations in the brain weight and the DNA and RNA contents of the brain while no clear effects could be detected after 0.8 Gy.",Excluded,0.9849327
62,Mathematical analysis of genetic effects of low doses of ionizing radiation. [Russian] The comparative study of effects of low doses of radiation on peripheral blood lymphocytes of persons occupationally exposed to radiation and non-exposed ones was carried out. The main attention was paid to radio-adaptive response forming under consistent exposure to low (0.05 Gy) and damaging (2 Gy) doses of gamma-irradiation. Noticeable heterogeneity in capacity for adaptive response forming in occupational group was revealed. The mathematical model adequate to experimental material was constructed using Kohonen neuronets.,Excluded,0.9849251

586,"Radiation-induced DNA strand breaks and their repair in the developing rat brain Rats, 5, 10 or 25 days old, were 60 Co gamma irradiated. The induction of DNA strand breaks was studied after killing the rats within 1 min after irradiation, and the repair of the induced breaks after various intervals up to 180 min. Cell suspensions were prepared from the brain and samples were transferred into alkaline solutions. The fraction of DNA remaining double-stranded after 30 min alkali treatment was estimated after separation of single- and double-stranded DNA on hydroxylapatite. The amount of DNA strand breaks induced per Gray (1--8 Gray) was found to be in accordance with earlier in vivo studies of the mouse small intestine and mouse spleen. The DNA strand breaks in the rat brain induced by 4 Gray 60Co gamma irradiation were repaired 30 min after irradiation in all age groups studied.",Excluded,0.9848519
539,"Long-lasting effects of neonatal ionizing radiation exposure on spatial memory and anxiety-like behavior Neonatal ionizing radiation exposure has been shown to induce a cerebellar cytoarchitecture disarrangement. Since cerebellar abnormalities have been linked to an impairment of behavioral functions, the aim of the present work was to investigate whether exposure of developing rats to ionizing radiations can produce behavioral deficits in the adult. Male Wistar rats were X-irradiated with 5Gy within 48h after birth and were tested in a radial maze and in an open field at 30 and 90 days post irradiation. Irradiated rats showed significative changes in spatial, exploratory, and procedural parameters in the radial maze, as well as a significative decrease in anxiety-like behavior, assessed in the open field. These results suggest that ionizing radiations can induce long-lasting spatial memory and anxiety-related changes. A relationship with radiation-induced cerebellar cytoarchitecture abnormalities supports the hypothesis that cerebellar integrity seems to be critical to achieve spatial performance and emotional behavior establishment.",Excluded,0.98483074

538,"Pharmacological alterations that could underlie radiation-induced changes in associative memory and anxiety It is widely known that ionizing radiation is a physical agent broadly used to kill tumor cells during human cancer therapy. Unfortunately, adjacent normal tissues can concurrently undergo undesirable cell injury. Previous data of our laboratory demonstrated that exposure of developing rats to ionizing radiations induced a variety of behavioral differences respect to controls, including changes in associative memory and in anxiety state. However, there is a lack of data concerning modifications in different related pharmacological intermediaries. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether the behavioral differences observed in young animals irradiated at birth might be underlain by early changes in PKCs1 levels which, in turn, could lead to changes in hippocampal GABAergic neurotransmission. Male Wistar rats were irradiated with 5Gy of X rays between 24 and 48 h after birth. Different pharmacological markers related to the affected behavioral tasks were assessed in control and irradiated hippocampus at 15 and 30 days, namely GABAA receptor, GAD65-67, ROS and PKCs1. Results showed that all measured parameters were increased in the hippocampus of 30-days-old irradiated animals. In contrast, in the hippocampus of 15-days-old irradiated animals only the levels of PKCs1 were decreased. These data suggest that PKCs1 might constitute a primary target for neonatal radiation damage on the hippocampus. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that an initial decrease in the levels of this protein can trigger a subsequent compensatory increase that, in turn, could be responsible for the plethora of biochemical changes that might underlie the previously observed behavioral alterations.",Excluded,0.9848129
930,"Effect of exposure to low-dose gamma radiation during late organogenesis in the mouse fetus The abdominal region of pregnant Swiss mice was exposed to 0.05 to 0.50 Gy of gamma radiation on day 11.5 postcoitus. The animals were sacrificed on day 18 of gestation and the fetuses were examined for mortality, growth retardation, changes in head size and brain weight, and incidence of microphthalmia. No marked increase in fetal mortality or growth retardation was observed below 0.25 Gy; the increase in these parameters was significant only at 0.50 Gy. A significant reduction in head size and brain weight and a significant increase in the incidence of microphthalmia were observed at doses above 0.15 Gy. Detectable levels of microcephaly and microphthalmia were evident even at 0.10 Gy. A linear dose response was seen for these effects in the dose range of 0.05 to 0.15 Gy. It is concluded that the late period of organogenesis in the mouse, especially between days 10 and 12 postcoitus, is a particularly sensitive phase in the development of the skull, brain and eye.",Excluded,0.9848011
97,"Temperature dependence of radiation-induced DNA-protein crosslinks formed under hypoxic conditions Recently, we demonstrated that the oxygen dependence of the formation of DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) in irradiated mammalian cells measured by the alkaline elution technique is the mirror image of the oxygen dependence of radiation-induced cell killing. Consequently, these radiation-induced DPCs could be used to detect hypoxic cells or estimate the hypoxic fraction of cells in solid tumors. Although several techniques, including alkaline elution, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and nitrocellulose filter binding, have been used to measure radiation-induced DPCs, the published reports suggest that the characteristics of these DPCs may depend on both the type of sample irradiated (cellular compared to model systems, oxygenated compared to hypoxic, etc.) and the technique used to measure these radiation-induced DPCs. In the present study, the radiation-induced DPCs measured by our alkaline elution technique with and without proteinase K in the lysis solution were characterized by studying the dependence of their formation on temperature in hypoxic rat 9L brain tumor cells. Exponentially growing 9L rat brain tumor cells were rendered hypoxic at 4degreeC or at 37degreeC and then irradiated with either 7.5 Gy or 15 Gy. The cells were trypsinized at 4degreeC, either immediately after the irradiation or after one half-time of strand break repair at 37degreeC. The results demonstrated that the radiation- induced DPCs produced in 9L cells under hypoxic conditions, measured by our alkaline elution technique after low to moderate radiation doses, required metabolism for their formation, unlike the radiation-induced DPCs reported by others using the GC/MS or nitrocellulose filter binding technique.",Excluded,0.9847477
101,"Experimental reorganization of the cerebellar cortes. V. Effects of early x-irradiation schedules that allow or prevent the acquisition of basket cells In neonate and infant rats the area of cerebellum was irradiated with different schedules of single or multiple doses of low-level X-ray. One set of schedules allowed the early recovery of the external germinal layer and the differentiation of all the postnatally-forming cell types while the other selectively prevented the acquisition of basket cells. The first schedule did not interfere with the development of normally oriented and arborizing Purkinje cells. The second schedule led to the growth of twisted and entwined stem dendrites even when, in association, with the recovered granule cells, parallel fibers were present in the molecular layer together with Purkinje cell spiny branchlets. Evidence was presented that the alignment of Purkinje cell perikarya in a monolayer does not guarantee the normal growth of Purkinje cell stem dendrites which may be dependent on the presence of basket cells. The problem was discussed whether cell differentiation in the cerebellar cortex is governed by a chronological or sequential principle.",Excluded,0.98468494
1155,"Evidence of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and identification of dying cells in X-ray-induced cell death in the developing brain Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats received a single dose of 2 Gy X-rays and were killed 6 hr later. Dying cells were characterized by extreme chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Dying cells were distributed in the primary and secondary germinal zones and in other brain regions. Among these latter, dying cells occurred in the cortical layers of the olfactory bulb, layers II-III and VIb of the neocortex, piriform and entorhinal cortex, stratum oriens and pyramidale of the hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, amygdala, brainstem, internal granular layer of the cerebellum, and cerebral and cerebellar white matter. Dying cells were immature cells, neurons and glial cells (including radial glia). In-situ labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation identified individual cells bearing fragmented DNA. Since the number of cells stained with this method was larger than the number of dying cells, as revealed with current histological techniques, it is suggested that nuclear DNA fragmentation precedes chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation in X-ray-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, agarose gel electrophoresis of extracted DNA from irradiated brains showed a ""ladder"" pattern which is typical of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and endonuclease activation.",Excluded,0.9846668

Immediately after a unique injection of a high dose of tretamine and 24 hours after the last of four applications of 0,25 to 2,0 mg/kg which were repeated each after one day, the sleeping time after hexobarbital was prolonged. 24 hours after fractionated injection of tretamine (0,5 mg/kg each time), the concentration of hexobarbital in the brain showed a significant increase compared with the control animals. These results show that the decreased effect of hexobarbital in the early post-irradiation phase is based on pharmacodynamic processes while the increase of the effect produced by continued administration of tretamine can be explained by pharmaco-cinetic reasons.",Excluded,0.984543

Aiming to study how glioma cells respond to gamma-rays in terms of biological processes involved in cellular responses, we performed experiments at cellular context and gene expression analysis in U343-MG-a GBM cells irradiated with 1 Gy and collected at 6 h post-irradiation. The survival rate was approximately 61% for 1 Gy and was completely reduced at 16 Gy. By performing the microarray technique, 859 cDNA clones were analyzed. The Significance Analysis of Microarray algorithm indicated 196 significant expressed genes (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.42%): 67 down-regulated and 97 up-regulated genes, which belong to several classes: metabolism, adhesion/cytoskeleton, signal transduction, cell cycle/apoptosis, membrane transport, DNA repair/DNA damage signaling, transcription factor, intracellular signaling, and RNA processing. Differential expression patterns of five selected genes (HSPA9B, INPP5A, PIP5K1A, FANCG, and TPP2) observed by the microarray analysis were further confirmed by the quantitative real time RT-PCR method, which demonstrated an up-regulation status of those genes.

525,"Cognitive Impairments in Subjects Exposed to Radiation during Prenatal Development Objective. To evaluate cognitive status in subjects exposed to ionizing radiation during antenatal development. Materials and methods. A total of 77 subjects with antenatal exposure to radiation were studied, along with a reference group of 73 subjects living in radiologically unpolluted territories in the Chelyabinsk region. Clinical, clinical psychological (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test (WAIS), and proverb interpretation) neurophysiological (EEG), and laboratory (cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoproteins triglycerides, cortisol, melatonin) methods were used. Results and discussion. These investigations showed that a significantly greater proportion of subjects exposed to radiation during antenatal development had nonpsychotic mental disorders with a predominance of organic mental impairments (cognitive and asthenic). Neurophysiological studies identified more profound abnormalities in brain bioelectrical activity with pathological rhythms and a predominance of the theta rhythm among those exposed to radiation. Clinical psychological study data identified a significant decrease in analytical-synthetic ability in irradiated subjects, along with lower general and verbal IQ levels. These changes were accompanied by higher cortisol and melatonin levels, supporting activation of and tension in the mechanisms of adaptation in subjects irradiated during antenatal development.

1083,"Risk factors for cerebrovascular deaths in patients operated and irradiated for pituitary tumors Vascular mortality, especially cerebrovascular disease (CVD), are the most pronounced cause of mortality in women with hypopituitarism. In a cohort of 342 patients operated and irradiated for pituitary tumors, 31 died from CVD (CVD patients) between 1952 and 1996. The study assessed whether the radiation regimens and duration of symptoms of hypopituitarism before operation differed between the 31 CVD patients and the 62 matched patients from the same cohort who had not died from CVD (control patients). Furthermore, the infarction/hemorrhage ratio, type of clinical stroke syndrome, and time to death after stroke were investigated in the CVD patients and in matched controls from the general population who had died from CVD (population controls). No significant differences in maximum or centrally absorbed dose, maximum or central biological equivalent dose, field size, or number of fraction were recorded between CVD and control patients. A significant difference in the duration of symptoms of hypopituitarism before operation was recorded, but only in women (P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in the infarction/hemorrhage ratio (P > 0.3) of lacunar or posterior circulation syndrome compared with middle cerebral artery syndrome with cortical features (P = 0.22) or the proportion of patients who died within the first month after stroke onset (60% vs. 59%, respectively) between CVD patients and population controls. In conclusion, no significant effect on CVD deaths could be detected for any radiation parameter. A long history of unsubstituted pituitary insufficiency may be a contributing factor to the very high CVD mortality among women.

595,"Neonatal gamma-ray irradiation impairs learning and memory of an olfactory associative task in adult rats Adult neonatally gamma-irradiated rats were compared with control animals in a non-spatial olfactory associative task using two different procedures. Irradiation induced a clear reduction in the total mean area of the olfactory bulbs and hippocampus but not of the orbital prefrontal cortex, diagonal band and cell layers of the entorhinal and piriform cortex. The gamma-irradiation affected the granule cells of the olfactory bulbs and differentially altered the cell layers of the subfields of the ammonic fields and the dorsal and ventral blades of the dentate gyrus. In the CA1 ammonic field, dorsal and ventral blades of the dentate gyrus, the cellular loss was significant in comparison with control adult rats. The behavioural data indicated that irradiated rats were deeply disturbed in learning the odour-reward association, and substantially impaired in a reversal experiment, but not in the discrimination of the odours per se. The cellular loss in the olfactory bulbs, in the CA1 and in the ventral blade of the gyrus dentatus was positively correlated with the deficit in behavioural performance. The data support the findings that the hippocampal system participates in the odour-reward associations and facilitates the long-term storage of associations after learning is achieved in this olfactory associative task.",Excluded,0.9843716

After irradiation, the rats were randomized to the radiation only control group and the Ramipril-treated (radiation + Ramipril) experimental group. Ramipril 1.5 mg/kg/day was given in the drinking water starting 1 week after radiation through the study duration.RESULTS: All the rats irradiated with 28.5-33 Gy became paralyzed at 125 +/- 4 days, whereas no rats became paralyzed after 23.6 Gy. The time to develop paralysis was delayed to 135 +/- 4 days in Ramipril-treated group (P < 0.001). H&E and LFB showed microscopic structural restoration and remyelination with Ramipril treatment. VEGF expression was increased in the irradiated spinal cord, and the number of VEGF-positive cells was significantly decreased by Ramipril treatment (P < 0.001). Immunohistochemical stain with Iba-1 showed increased microglial infiltration in the irradiated spinal cords. The number of Iba-1-positive microglia was significantly reduced by Ramipril treatment (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Ramipril reduced the rate of paralysis even at the paralysis-inducing radiation doses. It also significantly delayed the onset of paralysis. Neuroinflammation and endothelial cell damage may be the key mediators of radiation injury. Ramipril can be readily translatable to clinical application as a mitigatory of radiotherapeutic toxicity.",Excluded,0.98421013
858,"Use of human mesenchymal stem cell treatment to prevent anhedonia in a rat model of traumatic brain injury PURPOSE: Major depression and related mood disorders are the most common long-term outcomes associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Given the potentially debilitating consequences of depression, and the fact that TBI patients are frequently refractory to antidepressant drugs, new therapies are clearly needed. We hypothesized that human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), delivered intravenously, can effectively treat TBI-induced depression and other behavioral deficits associated with TBI.METHODS: Rats (n = 8 per group) were subjected to experimental TBI or control sham operation. Six hours post TBI, rats were treated with 1x106 hMSC or vehicle control. Immediately after TBI and prior to hMSC or control treatment, rats were subjected to either targeted precision x-ray irradiation to eliminate subventricular zone (SVZ) proliferation or sham irradiation. One week after TBI, SVZ irradiation, and hMSC treatment, rats were evaluated for the depression-like behavior, anhedonia, using the two-bottle saccharin preference paradigm; and for working memory using the novel object recognition test.RESULTS: TBI resulted in a 54% (p<=0.05) decrease in saccharin preference scores while treatment of TBI with hMSC fully prevented this anhedonic behavior. TBI was also found to produce a 73% (p<=0.05) decrease in novel object interaction time, indicating impaired working memory, and was similarly improved by treatment with hMSC. The ability of hMSC to prevent TBI-associated depression and working memory impairment was eliminated when SVZ proliferation was inhibited by irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: This work has identified a possible role for hMSC in the treatment of TBI-induced depression and other behaviors and suggests a mechanistic role for proliferative cells of the SVZ proliferation in hMSC efficacy.",Excluded,0.9841845

In this study, we aimed to detect WM changes throughout the brain of NPC patients by DTI. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used to analyze DTI data from 81 NPC patients. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were quantified across the whole brain in separate groups: pre-RT, and <6, 6-12, and >12 months post-RT. We found that fractional anisotropy values were significantly lower in the right frontal, parietal, and occipital WM <6 months post-RT compared with pre-RT and remained significantly lower in the right frontal and parietal WM at >12 months. MD values were significantly higher in the right occipital, bilateral temporal, right occipital-temporal junction, left parietal, left centrum semiovale, and left frontal-parietal junction WM <6 months post-RT and remained higher in the right occipital WM at >12 months. This study suggests that changes in white matter microstructure following RT for NPC were widespread, complex, and dynamic.

As the process of myelination follows the completion of neurite outgrowth and is concurrent with the stabilization of fiber numbers in a pathway, we set out to determine whether myelination and fiber tract stability could be causally related. Myelin formation was prevented in the rat retinofugal pathway by x-irradiating the optic nerves during oligodendrocyte proliferation. Electron microscopic and immunohistochemical analysis of irradiated optic nerves at P15 showed that oligodendrocytes and myelin were virtually absent. Optic fiber numbers were determined at 2 weeks of age throughout the length of normal and x-irradiated nerves. In some cases, normal or irradiation-treated pups were intraocularly injected with FGF 5 d prior to the fiber count in order to promote neurite outgrowth. Axon counts showed that the total fiber number in a myelin-free optic nerve was 10-30% higher than that of a myelinated nerve. Further, fiber numbers fluctuated by as much as 20% along the length of a myelin-free nerve but were relatively constant throughout the length of a myelinated nerve. Treatment of myelinated nerves with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) had no effect on either total fiber numbers or fiber number fluctuation. Conversely, fiber numbers in myelin-free/FGF-treated optic nerves were as much as 40% higher than in normals. Furthermore, total fiber numbers along the length of these nerves fluctuated by up to 34%. These results indicate that, in the absence of myelination, optic fibers are able to form sprouts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded,0.98348755
1064,"Neuroprotective effect of EGb761 and low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation in a rat model of Parkinson's disease Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. The present study was undertaken to investigate the pretreatment effects of standardized Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) and low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation on the neurological dysfunction in the reserpine model of PD. Male Wistar rats were pretreated orally with EGb761 or fractionated low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation or their combination, then subjected to intraperitoneal injection of reserpine (5 mg/kg body weight) 24 h after the final dose of EGb761 or radiation. Reserpine injection resulted in the depletion of striatal dopamine (DA) level, increased catalepsy score, increased oxidative stress indicated via depletion of glutathione (GSH), increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and iron levels, decreased DA metabolites metabolizing enzymes; indicated by inhibition by glutathione-S-transferase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-quinone oxidoreductase (NQO) activities, mitochondrial dysfunction; indicated by declined complex I activity, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level and increased apoptosis; indicated by decreased mitochondrial B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein level and by transmission electron microscope.

816,"Fate of the multiple innervation of cerebellar Purkinje cells by climbing fibers in immature control, x-irradiated and hypothyroid rats The fate of the multiple innervation of Purkinje cells (PCs) by climbing fibers (CFs) was studied as a function of age in immature rats rendered agranular by X-irradiation, in immature hypothyroid rats, and compared to that in controls. This was done by examining in each group the intracellular activities of PCs mediated via CFs throughout maturation. From the third day in control rats, CF responses of PCs evoked by juxta fastigial region (JF) stimulation or occurring spontaneously already resembled the adult responses with, however, some important differences: (1) most of these responses were graded by steps with the intensity of the stimulation before day 13, due to the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs (see below); (2) immature CF responses exhibited a longer duration and their initial spike started near the peak of the EPSP instead of near the baseline later on. Finally, an anlage of CF response was already present in most PCs on day 2, and consisted of a single fast spike elicited near the peak of an underlying all-or-none EPSP. In the 3 groups of rats, CF EPSPs already closely resembled the adult ones as early as 3 days, although their total duration and especially their time to peak were longer. In control rats, these CF EPSPs reversed with depolarizing currents from day 3 and currents for reversal were much lower than in the adult. 'Dual' CF EPSPs of PCS37 were encountered in immature 7- to 10-day-old controls, and persisted in hypothyroid rats until the end of the third postnatal week. The mono- or the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was ascertained in th 3 groups according to the graded or the all-or-none character of CF EPSPs, and the number of CFs impinging on a given PC was estimated by the number of steps in the response. In control rats, most of PCs were already multiply innervated by CFs as early as 3 days. The multiple innervation culminated on day 5 with an average number of 3.4 CFs for PC, and rapidly regressed later on, so that the adult-type monoinnervation was the rule after day 13. In hypothyroid rats, the establishment of the redundancy and its regression was delayed by 2--3 days. In X-irradiated rats, the settlement and the involution of the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was exactly superimposed with that seen in controls until day 8. Later on, regression of the supernumerary contacts no longer occurred so that most PCs remained multiply innervated until adulthood. Finally, the first clear-cut IPSPs were detected in PCs on day 9 in control and X-irradiated rats and 2--3 days later in hypothyroid animals.",Excluded,0.98285496
375,"[Effects of parabolic flight on redox status in SH-SY5Y cells] Space flight is known to produce a number of neurological disturbances. The etiology is unknown, but it may involve increased oxidative stress. A line of experimental evidence indicates that space flight may disrupt antioxidant defense system and result in increased oxidative stress. In vitro studies found that abundant of NO was produced in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and protein nitration was increased in PC12 cells within a simulated microgravity rotating wall bioreactor high aspect ratio vessel system or clinostat system. In the present study, we observed the change of redox status in SH-SY5Y cells after parabolic flight, and studied the effects of key redox molecule, thioredoxin (TRX), during the altered gravity. SH-SY5Y cells were divided into four groups: control cells, control cells transfected with TRX, flight cells and flight cells transfected with TRX. The expression levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TRX and thioredoxin reductase (TRXR) were observed by immunocytochemical method. It was shown that after parabolic flight, the staining of 3-NT and TRX were enhanced, while the expression level of TRXR was down-regulated compared with control. As for flight cells transfected with TRX, the staining of 3-NT and iNOS were weakened compared with flight cells. These results obtained suggest that altered gravity may increase protein nitration, down-regulate TRXR and elicit oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells, while TRX transfection could partly protect cells against oxidative stress induced by parabolic flight.",Excluded,0.98281336

1080,"Carbamylated erythropoietin reduces radiosurgically-induced brain injury Gamma knife radiosurgery is an attractive noninvasive treatment of brain tumors and vascular malformations that minimizes collateral tissue damage. However, exposure of normal tissue to even low-dose radiation triggers a cascade of acute and chronic injury and potentially significant morbidity and mortality. Because many irradiated patients now survive for years, identifying methods to prevent radiotherapy-induced collateral tissue damage is a major focus of current research. Erythropoietin (EPO), a cytokine produced locally by many tissues in response to injury, antagonizes apoptosis, reduces inflammation, and promotes healing. Systemic administration of recombinant EPO, widely used for treatment of anemia, provides robust protection from numerous insults in a variety of tissues, including the brain. Although irradiation injury is likely sensitive to EPO, the hematopoietic activity of EPO is undesirable in this setting, increasing erythrocyte number and predisposing to thrombosis. To avoid these potential adverse effects, we developed carbamylated EPO (CEPO) which does not stimulate the bone marrow. In this study, we show that CEPO (50 microg kg(-1) intraperitoneally) improves functional outcome when administered to adult rats just before, and then once daily for 10 d after, a necrotizing dose of radiation (100 Gy) to the right striatum. Immediately following irradiation, use and reflex movements of the contralateral forelimb to vibrissae stimulation were abnormal but rapidly improved in animals receiving CEPO. Moreover, histological examination revealed that the extent of brain necrosis after 90 days was reduced by approximately 50%. These findings further extend the kinds of injury for which administration of a tissue-protective cytokine provides benefit.",Excluded,0.9821547

Antioxidative potential was ascertained as the susceptibility of tissues to undergo protein oxidation, manifested as protein carbonyls, in response to acute oxidative stress, induced by exposure to x-rays. Brain homogenates from 22-month-old rats were more susceptible to oxidative stress than those from three-month- old rats. Brain was more susceptible to oxidative damage than the heart.

65,"Models of bystander signalling between primary astrocytes and glioma cells: Effects on survival and migration/invasion INTRODUCTION: The goal of radiotherapy is to cause cell death in the targeted tumour field and minimize toxicity to the surrounding normal tissue. However, malignant gliomas are highly resistant to ionizing radiation (IR). Recent data suggest migration/invasion is up-regulated as a counterproductive effect of IR. In addition to direct IR effects, non-targeted radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBE), observed beyond the targeted field, can cause significant cell death of the tumour and surrounding normal tissues. Little is known of how RIBE modulates glioma migration/invasion. METHOD(S): RIBE of 10 astrocytes and glioma cells grown as single and cocultures in 2D (monolayer) and 3D matrices was investigated, using media transferred from irradiated cultures and in half-exposed/shielded cultures. Nuclear 53BP1 foci were used as a surrogateDNA damage marker and transwell assays to quantitate migration/invasion. Two3D models were developed to study gliospheres in: (i) collagen matrices with/without astrocytes and (ii) mouse brain slice cultures. RESULT(S): RIBE signals from IR and non-IR glioma cultures both decreased astrocyte clonogenic survival.Weobserved increased DNA damage in astrocyte and glioma bystander cells in 2D and 3D cultures. Bystander cells had increased p38-MAPK, Connexin 43, and COX-2signalling. Direct IR induced an increase and RIBE a decrease in transwell migration. Experiments of gliosphere migration/invasion in 3D models are underway. CONCLUSION(S): These results may have implications for tumour-normal tissue margin interactions. By comparing differential molecular factors involved in the RIBE, we aim to find targets to enhance glioma cell death and inhibit migration/invasion, while preserving normal tissue.",Excluded,0.97996855

Monomers and small oligomers of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, players in Alzheimer's disease, are recently suggested to be involved in damaging of neurons, instead of extracellular Abeta plaques. We demonstrate that externally applied disaggregated Abeta<sub>1-42</sub> peptide interacts preferentially with acidic compartments (lysosomes). We compared standard cell cultivation (21% O<sub>2</sub>) to more physiological cell cultivation (5% O<sub>2</sub>). Cells did not exhibit a dramatic increase in ROS and change in glutathione level upon 4 muM Abeta peptide treatment, whereas exposure to 2 Gy X-rays increased ROS and changed glutathione level and ATP concentration. The occurrence of the 4977 bp deletion in mtDNA and significant protein carbonylation were specific effects of IR and more pronounced at 21% O<sub>2</sub>. An increase in cell death after Abeta peptide treatment or irradiation was unexpectedly restored to the control level or below when both were combined, particularly at 5% O<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, Abeta peptide at low concentration can trigger neuroprotective mechanisms in cells exposed to radiation. Oxygen concentration is an important modulator of cellular responses to stress.",Excluded,0.97989273

In an attempt to overcome this problem, fast neutrons were compared in a controlled pilot study with conventional megavoltage X-rays (photons). Sixty-three patients entered the study between January, 1973 and July, 1976, 30 patients received neutron and 33 received X-ray therapy. The overall mean survival was 11.4 months for those who received photon and 10 months for those who received neutron therapy. Survival rates at 6 and 12 months were 72% and 36%, respectively for photon treated patients, and 77% and 30% for those treated with neutrons. Although neutron therapy did not improve overall survival, examination of the histologic material indicated a considerably greater antitumor effect after neutron therapy than after treatment with photons. In the neutron treated group, at postmortem examination no tumor or only minimal tumor was found in 10 of 12 patients and in one of 4 patients where tissue was obtained from a second craniotomy.

972,"The frequency of adverse events by radiation therapy for atomic bomb survivors with cancer Purpose/Objective(s): In Japan, there are many survivors who received ionizing radiation by atomic bomb in 1945. Currently, atomic bomb survivors (ABS) who suffered from cancer are treated as same as usual cancer patients. However, it remains unclear whether the adverse events (AE) of radiation therapy (RT) are increased or not in ABS. To clarify the safety of RT for ABS, we evaluated the frequency of AE by RT in ABS. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively investigated medical records of patients who received curative RT for cancer between 2005 and 2010. We selected the ABS who were officially certified by the Japanese government. AE were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) score Ver.3. One hundred and sixty-five ABS were recruited in this study. Median age was 74 years old (59 to 93) and 96 (58.2%) were men. Median age at the time receiving ionizing radiation by atomic bomb was 11 years old (0 to 32). One hundred and thirty-six ABS (82.4%) were pre-treatment performance status (PS) 0, 21 (12.7%) was PS 1, and 8 (4.8%) were PS 2 or over. Thirty-seven were diagnosed with head and neck, 32 with genitourinary, 29 with breast, 27 with gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary and pancreatic, 23 with lung and mediastinum, and 17 with other cancer. Result(s): One hundred four ABS were definitive irradiation, 48 were postoperative irradiation, and 13 were pre-operative irradiation. Concurrent chemotherapy was performed on 51. Median dose of external RTwas 50 Gy (30 to 78) based on their cancer type. Fifteen patients were performed on stereotactic RT, 12 on intensity-modulated RT, and 11 on brachytherapy. All patients were received standard dose irradiation and completed planned RT. No patients received extended RTover 1 week. Median observation time was 40 months (1 to 84). One hundred fifty-six patients (94.5%) were alive and 9 (5.5%) were dead when at the time investigated. There were no patients who died of AE in the entire course. In acute AE, sixteen patients (9.7%) were classified into grade 3 or above, i.e. one with esophageal mucositis and 15 with hematotoxicity (Grade 3: 11, Grade 4: 4). All these patients received concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Grade 4 or 5 non-hematotoxicitic AE was not identified. In late AE, twelve patients (7.3%) were classified into Grade 3 or above. Four patients were classified into Grade 4, i.e. 3 with myelodysplastic syndrome and 1 with cerebral infarction. Conclusion(s): Notable incensements of AE were not observed during and after RT for ABS. This study clarified that standard dose RT prescription can be administered safely to ABS with cancer even though they received ionizing radiation by atomic bomb before half century.",Excluded,0.9793809

923,"Ionizing radiation induces endothelial transdifferentiation of glioblastoma stem-like cells through the Tie2 signaling pathway Glioblastomas (GBM) are brain tumors with a poor prognosis despite treatment that combines surgical resection and radio-chemotherapy. These tumors are characterized by abundant vascularization and significant cellular heterogeneity including GBM stem-like cells (GSC) which contribute to tumor aggressiveness, resistance, and recurrence. Recent data has demonstrated that GSC are directly involved in the formation of new vessels via their transdifferentiation into Tumor Derived Endothelial Cells (TDEC). We postulate that cellular stress such as ionizing radiation (IR) could enhance the transdifferentiation of GSC into TDEC. GSC neurospheres isolated from 3 different patients were irradiated or not and were then transdifferentiated into TDEC. In fact, TDEC obtained from irradiated GSC (TDEC IR+) migrate more towards VEGF, form more pseudotubes in Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> in vitro and develop more functional blood vessels in Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> plugs implanted in Nude mice than TDEC obtained from non-irradiated GSC. Transcriptomic analysis allows us to highlight an overexpression of Tie2 in TDEC IR+. All IR-induced effects on TDEC were abolished by using a Tie2 kinase inhibitor, which confirms the role of the Tie2 signaling pathway in this process. Finally, by analyzing Tie2 expression in patient GBMs by immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that the number of Tie2+ vessels increases in recurrent GBM compared with matched untreated tumors. In conclusion, we demonstrate that IR potentiates proangiogenic features of TDEC through the Tie2 signaling pathway, which indicates a new pathway of treatment-induced tumor adaptation. New therapeutic strategies that associate standard treatment and a Tie2 signaling pathway inhibitor should be considered for future trials.",Excluded,0.9777298

Method(s): Human cerebral glioma stem/progenitor cell line SU-2 and human cerebral glioma cell line U251, SHG-44 were cultured in vitro under stem cell culture conditions. Changes of cell morphology, percentage of Hoechst 33342<sup>-</sup> and CD133<sup>+</sup> cells, tumor cell survival ratio, nude mice tumorigeinity were observed before and after different radiation dosages of linear accelerator. MGMT gene expression levels of human cerebral glioma cell line U251 and human cerebral glioma stem/progenitor cell line SU-2 were assayed by real-time fluorescene quantitative PCR method before and after radiation.

The two treatment groups were matched for the following potential prognostic factors: WBRT schedule, age, gender, performance status, tumor type, number of brain metastases, extra-cerebral metastases, and recursive partitioning analysis class (RPA). The outcomes of patients in both groups were evaluated in terms of toxicity, local control, and overall survival.RESULTS: Total of 97 patients were selected (56 male; 42 female) who were respectively submitted to surgical resection followed by WBRT (group A, n = 50 patients) or WBRT + SRT (Group B, n = 47 patients). Median follow-up was 95 months (range, 8-171 months). The 1-year local control rates were 46.0% and 69.0% respectively.

The baboon model proved to be a valuable technique to assess the in vivo radiobiologic response of single-fraction irradiation doses delivered to the primate brain stem. Multimodality neurodiagnostic testing, including CT, MR imaging, xenon-enhanced CT, evoked potential studies, and analysis of CSF myelin basic protein levels, all of which eventually were correlated with neuropathologic examination, enabled detection of lesions produced with high-dose (150 Gy) radiosurgery as early as 6 weeks. Within the first 6 months after radiosurgery, lower doses (20 Gy, 50 Gy) did not result in clinically or neurodiagnostically detectable lesions.

We believe that such fundamental studies ultimately will improve our ability to reach the goals of radiosurgery: to destroy the target and spare the surrounding brain.

However, the long-term effects of this combination therapy on the normal brain tissue are unknown. Here, we examined mice that were intracranially implanted with murine glioma cell line and became long-term survivors after treatment with a combination of 10 Gy cranial irradiation (RT) and anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade (aPD-1). Post-mortem analysis of the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to tumor implantation showed complete abolishment of hippocampal neurogenesis, but neural stem cells were well preserved in subventricular zone. In addition, we observed a drastic reduction in the number of mature oligodendrocytes in the subcortical white matter. Importantly, this observation was evident specifically in the combined (RT+aPD-1) treatment group but not in the single treatment arm of either RT alone or aPD-1 alone. Elimination of microglia with a small molecule inhibitor of colony stimulated factor-1 receptor (PLX5622) prevented the loss of mature oligodendrocytes.

This study evaluates bowel function and related quality of life in patients 2 - 4 years after hemicolectomy, comparing the results to healthy controls. Methods Eligible patients were identified from prospectively maintained colorectal databases at two teaching hospitals. Patients were recruited during regular follow up visits or by telephone interview. Patient relatives with an intact colon were recruited as controls. Study exclusion criteria were poor cognitive ability, inflammatory bowel disease, metastatic disease, previous pelvic radiation, prior colonic, stomach or small bowel resection, bypass surgery, vagotomy, an existing stoma and anal incontinence. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) questionnaire was used to assess bowel function and the EQ-5D questionnaire to assess quality of life (QOL). Parametric and non-parametric tests were used with log transformation and regression methods for skewed data. Association between EQ-5D and MSKCC scores was examined with Spearman's rank correlation. Results A total of 85 patients (mean age 69 +/- 11.2 years) and 85 controls (mean age 58.2 +/- 13.4 years) were recruited in 12 months. Patients reported a significantly higher number of bowel movements per day than controls (2 versus 1, P < 0.001). Initial analysis suggested that patients had a significantly lower total MSKCC score (group difference mean -3.1, CI -5.8 to -0.4, p = 0.02), indicating worse bowel function in the patient group. Following adjustment for age, sex and co-morbidities, differences in total score were no longer significant, but the patient group had a lower score for the frequency subscale and the ability to control flatus (p = 0.008 and p = < 0.001). MSKCC frequency scores were worse after right-sided resections (p = 0.03). High scores for complete emptying and the differentiation between wind and solid had a positive correlation with better QOL (p = 0.007 and 0.02 respectively). There was a nonsignificant decrease in the overall QOL (EQ-5D p = 0.6, EQ-VAS p = 0.12) following hemicolectomy compared with controls.

The tumors are frequently irradiated which may predispose to vascular abnormalities. We reviewed a large center's experience. Method(s): Records of the brain tumor program, spanning 21 years, were reviewed for patients with craniopharyngioma. Demographics, details of treatment, clinical course, and Results of imaging over time are described. Result(s): 50 patients with craniopharyngioma were identified, 8 of whom were excluded for inadequate data. 42 patients were followed over a mean of 7.2 years after treatment, 17 of whom eventually were found to have vascular abnormalities. Of these patients, 2 had received craniotomy alone with no radiation. The remainder had radiation, 4 after failure of initial intracystic therapy and either with or without further operation. 11 were treated with operation, either craniotomy or endoscopic biopsy or resection, followed by radiation. 3 patients developed cavernous malformations, 9 patients had aneurysmal dilatation of one or more vessels, and 10 had vessel narrowing or occlusion, which in some was documented to progress. Mean time to identification of the first abnormality was 3.4 years after radiation, and 1.4 years after operation alone. 2 patients with moya moya syndrome after radiation required cerebral revascularization procedures.

These patients were subjected to 3D-EPSI and DTI at two time points (pre-radiation, and 1 month post-irradiation). Parametric maps of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) were generated and co-registered to post-contrast T1-weighted images. Normal appearing gray-matter and white-matter regions were compared between the two time points to assess sub-acute effects of radiation using independent sample t-tests.RESULTS: Significantly increased MD (P = .02), Cho/Cr (P = .02) and a trend towards a decrease in NAA/Cr (P = .06) was observed from the hippocampus. Significant decrease in FA (P = .02) from the centrum-semiovale and a significant increase in MD (P = .04) and Cho/Cr (P = .02) from genu of corpus-callosum was also observed.CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that 3D-EPSI and DTI may provide quantitative measures of radiation induced injury to the normal brain.",Excluded,0.9621318

Determination of the timing and dose of radiation therapy required the assessment of the duration of the effect of wtp53 expression on 9L tumors after in vivo transfection. Methods. Anesthetized male F-344 rats each were stereotactically inoculated with 4 x 10<sup>4</sup> 9L gliosarcoma cells through a skull screw into the cerebrum in the right frontal region. Twelve-day-old tumors were inoculated through the screw with recombinant adenoviral vectors under isoflurane anaesthesia: control rats with Ad5/RSV/GL2 (carrying the luciferase gene), and study rats with Ad5CMV-p53 (carrying the wtp53 gene). Brain tumors removed at specific times after transfection were measured, homogenized, and lysed and wtp53 expression determined by Western blot analysis. Four groups of nine rats were, subsequently, implanted with iodine-125 seeds 15 days post-tumor inoculation to give a minimum tumor dose of 40 or 60 Gy. Results. We demonstrated transfer of wtp53 into rat 9L tumors in vivo using the Ad5CMV-p53 vector. The expression of wtp53 was demonstrated to be maximum between days 1 and 3 post-vector inoculation. Tumors expressing wtp53 were smaller than controls transfected with Ad5/RSV/GL2 but this difference was not statistically significant.

We utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with multiple b-values (diffusion weightings) to model the dose-dependency and time course of radiation effects on white matter.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with high-grade gliomas treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy underwent MRI with DTI prior to radiotherapy, and after months 1, 4-6, and 9-11. Diffusion tensors were calculated using three weightings (high, standard, and low b-values) and maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (lambda<sub></sub>), and radial diffusivity (lambda<sub></sub>) were generated. The region of interest was all white matter.RESULTS: MD, lambda<sub></sub>, and lambda<sub></sub> increased significantly with time and dose, with corresponding decrease in FA. Greater changes were seen at lower b-values, except for FA. Time-dose interactions were highly significant at 4-6months and beyond (p<.001), and the difference in dose response between high and low b-values reached statistical significance at 9-11months for MD, lambda<sub></sub>, and lambda<sub></sub> (p<.001, p<.001, p=.005 respectively) as well as at 4-6months for lambda<sub></sub> (p=.04).CONCLUSIONS: We detected dose-dependent changes across all doses, even <10Gy. Greater changes were observed at low b-values, suggesting prominent extracellular changes possibly due to vascular permeability and neuroinflammation.",Excluded,0.9610768
432,"Multicomponent T<inf>2</inf> relaxometry reveals early myelin white matter changes induced by proton radiation treatment Purpose: To investigate MRI myelin water imaging (MWI) by multicomponent T<inf>2</inf> relaxometry as a quantitative imaging biomarker for brain radiation-induced changes and to compare it with DTI. Method(s): Sixteen patients underwent fractionated proton therapy (PT) receiving dose to the healthy tissue because of direct or indirect (base skull tumors) irradiation. MWI was performed by a multi-echo sequence with 32 equally spaced echoes (10-320 ms). Decay data were processed to identify 3 T<inf>2</inf> compartments: myelin water (Mw) below 40 ms, intra-extracellular water (IEw) between 40 and 250 ms, and free water (CSFw) above 250 ms. Both MWI and DTI scans were acquired pre (pre)-treatment and immediately at the end (end) of PT. After image registration, voxel-wise difference maps, obtained by subtracting MWI and DTI pre from those acquired at the end of PT, were compared with the corresponding biological equivalent dose (BED). Result(s): Mw difference showed a positive correlation and IEw difference showed a negative correlation with BED considering end-pre changes (P <.01). The changes in CSFw were not significantly correlated with the delivered BED. The changes in DTI data, considering end-pre acquisitions, showed a positive correlation between fractional anisotropy and the delivered BED. Conclusion(s): MWI might detect early white matter radiation-induced alterations, providing additional information to DTI, which might improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of the radiation damage.

1111,"Perfusion magnetic resonance imaging changes in normal appearing brain tissue after radiotherapy in glioblastoma patients may confound longitudinal evaluation of treatment response The aim of this study was assess acute and early delayed radiation-induced changes in normal-appearing brain tissue perfusion as measured with perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the dependence of these changes on the fractionated radiotherapy (FRT) dose level. Seventeen patients with glioma WHO grade III-IV treated with FRT were included in this prospective study, seven were excluded because of inconsistent FRT protocol or missing examinations. Dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI and contrast-enhanced 3D-T1-weighted (3D-T1w) images were acquired prior to and in average (standard deviation): 3.1 (3.3), 34.4 (9.5) and 103.3 (12.9) days after FRT. Pre-FRT 3D-T1w images were segmented into white- and grey matter. Cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps were calculated and co-registered patient-wise to pre-FRT 3D-T1w images. Seven radiation dose regions were created for each tissue type: 0-5 Gy, 5-10 Gy, 10-20 Gy, 20-30 Gy, 30-40 Gy, 40-50 Gy and 50-60 Gy. Mean CBV and CBF were calculated in each dose region and normalised (nCBV and nCBF) to the mean CBV and CBF in 0-5 Gy white- and grey matter reference regions, respectively. Regional and global nCBV and nCBF in white- and grey matter decreased after FRT, followed by a tendency to recover. The response of nCBV and nCBF was dose-dependent in white matter but not in grey matter. Our data suggest that radiation-induced perfusion changes occur in normal-appearing brain tissue after FRT. This can cause an overestimation of relative tumour perfusion using dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI, and can thus confound tumour treatment evaluation.

55,"Responsiveness of growth hormone release in acromegalics after irradiation or hypophysectomy Effects of X-ray irradiation to the pituitary and transfrontal hypophysectomy were evaluated on the responsiveness of plasma growth hormone (GH) to exogenous stimuli in 8 patients with acromegaly. As exogenous stimuli, arginine, TRH, LH-RH and L-dopa were administered. In 2 out of 3 patients treated with Liniac irradiation, the responsiveness to arginine was essentially unchanged, while in the third patient positive response to arginine disappeared after therapy. Of 2 patients who received a combination of hypophysectomy and Liniac irradiation, the responsiveness to arginine, TRH, LH-RH and L-dopa did not change in 1 patient, but in the other it was observed that negative response to L-dopa became positive after the treatment, remaining the unchanged responsiveness to arginine, TRH, and LH-RH. In 3 hypophysectomized patients, little change in responses to the above 4 stimuli was observed. In summary, out of 22 pairs of responses (pre- and post-therapy) examined 20 were not altered. In 11 pairs of responses (pre- and post-irradiation) particularly, 10 were essentially unchanged. It might be concluded that the responsiveness of GH to exogenous stimuli in acromegalics would not be affected by irradiation or transfrontal hypophysectomy.",Excluded,0.94664294

49,"Tumor cell subpopulation changes during intracranial glioblastoma patient derived xenograft recurrence following radiation, temozolomide, or combination therapy We've established a model for recurrent GBM by treating mice bearing previously untreated, luciferase-modified, intracranial GBM PDX, with radiation (RT) (2 Gy/day, M-F), temozolomide (TMZ) only (10 mg/kg/day, M-F), or concurrent RT/TMZ. PDX respond to treatment by showing a reduced rate of increase in tumor bioluminescence (RT only), or decreased tumor bioluminescence (TMZ only or RT/TMZ), but with eventual tumor growth requiring animal euthanasia at 5.5 (RT only), 26.5 (TMZ only), or 38 (RT/TMZ) days beyond the median survival of untreated control animal subjects. All survival extensions are significant relative to untreated control mice (p<0.05). To examine the effects of treatment on tumor cell subpopulations in intracranial PDX, we employed flow cytometric analyses of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) positive GBM cells, using a panel of markers (CD133, CD15, ABCG2, SOX2, EZH2, HIF1A, MGMT, and H3K27me3). RT alone did not cause a significant enrichment for any specific subpopulation, as identified using the markers indicated above. In contrast, PDX exposed to TMZ monotherapy or RT/TMZ combination therapy showed enrichment for CD133+HIF1A+ cells (p<0.005). PDX treated with RT/TMZ were also enriched for CD133+CD15+, and additionally showed enrichment for CD133+SOX2+ and CD133+EZH2+ cells (p<0.005 for each). Perhaps not so surprisingly, recurrent tumors that had been treated with TMZ or RT/ TMZ showed increased cellular positivity for MGMT (Control 0.78% vs. TMZ 3.4% p<0.005 and RT/TMZ 4.3% p<0.0005), though, paradoxically, these tumors also showed increased cellular positivity for EZH2 (Control 0.38% vs. TMZ 3.0% p=ns and RT/TMZ 7.8% p<0.0005) and a product of EZH2 activity, H3K27me3 (Control 0.55% vs. TMZ 18.2% p<0.0005 and RT/TMZ 4.3% p=ns), which is associated with transcriptional suppression. Corresponding immunohistochemical analysis is ongoing, with results to be presented at the meeting. In total, our data indicate that, in recurrent tumors, cell subpopulation selection/enrichment depends on the type of therapy administered, which should, in turn, influence the selection of salvage therapy for treating recurrent GBM.",Excluded,0.92550796

Methods and Results We conducted a retrospective cohort study within a provincial linked database of 5718 cardiac patients with thorax and head or neck cancer having undergone radiotherapy between 2000 and 2011. One thousand five hundred fifty-two patients were identified as nonstatin users and 4166 as statin users. The primary outcome of interest was the composite of cerebrovascular (transient ischemic attack, and fatal or nonfatal stroke) or cardiovascular events (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction). Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed. The crude event rate was 10.31% for nonusers and 9.03% for statin users (hazard ratio of 0.92 [95% CI 0.76-1.10, P=0.3451]), over a mean time to event/censoring of 534+/-687 days for nonusers and 594+/-706 days for the statin users. After adjusting for age, sex, prior history of stroke/transient ischemic attack or myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and hypertension, statin use postradiotherapy was associated with a nonsignificant 15% relative risk reduction, but a strong trend toward reducing the primary outcome (hazard ratio=0.85 95% CI 0.69-1.04, P=0.0811). The use of statins was associated with a significant reduction of 32% for the outcome of stroke alone (hazard ratio=0.68, 95% CI 0.48-0.98, P=0.0368). Conclusions Statin use post radiation therapy was associated with a significant reduction in stroke, with a trend toward significantly reducing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.",Excluded,0.91697097

A cross-sectional study with consecutive sampling was conducted. NPC survivors were recruited from otolaryngology/oncology outpatient clinics in a medical centre in Northern Taiwan. Study measures included (1) Mandibular Function Impairment Questionnaire, (2) Xerostomia Questionnaire, (3) Mini Nutrition Assessment, (4) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Depression subscale, and (5) Symptom Severity Scale. A total of 110 subjects were recruited. Those receiving intensity-modulated radiation therapy had less trismus and xerostomia than patients receiving two-dimensional radiation therapy. Patients with female gender, advanced stage, completion of treatments within 1 year, higher levels of depression, more severe trismus and higher symptom severity tended to have malnutrition or were at risk of malnutrition. Trismus and xerostomia are long-term problems in some NPC survivors and may contribute to malnutrition. To better manage a patient's trismus and xerostomia and to enhance nutritional status, clinicians should develop a patient-specific care programme based on careful assessment and targeted measures to improve oral function and insure adequate nutritional intake.",Excluded,0.9078185
1134,"Endovascular treatment for carotid artery stenosis after neck irradiation BACKGROUND: To lower the risk of complications, carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has been proposed as an alternative to open surgery for carotid artery stenosis after neck irradiation. However, there are little postoperative data to support the benefits of this strategy. This study evaluated the outcome of CAS in patients who had undergone neck irradiation.METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at 15 vascular surgery or interventional radiology centers in France between January 1998 and July 2006. A total of 135 patients (115 men) with a mean age of 67 +/- 8 years (range, 43-88) underwent CAS for 149 irradiation-induced lesions. The interval between irradiation and discovery of the lesions was 12 +/- 8 years. Mean diameter reduction was 81% (range, 50%-95%), and stenosis was symptomatic in 34%. Contralateral carotid lesions were observed in 48% of patients, including thrombosis in 18 and stenosis >50% in 53.RESULTS: Technical failure occurred during CAS in three cases. The overall technical success rate was 98%. A cerebral protection device was used in 59%. No death, one transient ischemic attack, and two strokes occurred during the first postoperative month. Mean follow-up was 30 months. Six patients were lost to follow-up. Survival rates were 93.9% at 1 year and 75.3% at 3 years. Complications after the first postoperative month included neurologic events in six, carotid thrombosis in nine, and restenosis in 18. The rates of freedom from neurologic and anatomic events were, respectively, 96.2% and 93.2% at 1 year and 93.1% and 85.9% at 3 years.CONCLUSION: The immediate outcome of CAS for irradiation-induced carotid artery stenosis was satisfactory. Medium-term neurologic outcome was acceptable, but the incidence of anatomic events such as thrombosis and restenosis was high. A randomized study is needed to confirm that the outcome of the endovascular and surgical therapy is comparable in this indication.",Excluded,0.8987328

II: Effects of extended exposure to acrylamide Acrylamide was administered orally to 6 week old male rats in ten doses, spread over a two week period. At the two lower doses (5 and 10 mg/kg, total dose 50 and 100 mg/kg) effects on neurotransmitter receptor sites appeared confirmed to the striatum where both the dopamine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors exhibited enhanced binding twenty four hours after the last acrylamide dose. Other receptor sites within the frontal cortex, cerebellum, and medulla were not significantly altered. At the highest dose (20 mg/kg, given ten times), increases were also found for frontal cortical serotonin, medullary glycine, and cerebellar GABA receptor sites. The only unaffected receptor found was the cortical site for benzodiazepene. One week after the final acrylamide dose, the intensity of all ligands studied was not significantly different in treated and control groups. Thus, effects appeared reversible. Since striatal membrane protein concentration was reduced by treatment with rats with acrylamide, the observed increase in activity of muscarinic receptors could be best accounted for in terms of loss of striatal non-receptor protein rather than increased binding. However, the magnitude of increased striatal <sup>3</sup>H-spiroperidol binding in treated animals suggested an increase in overall binding capacity. An effect on dopamine neutrons was also suggested by a decreased responsiveness to apomorphine in rats treated with acrylamide at 10 mg/kg for 10 successive days; however, the effect had dissipated by 8 days after the final injection of acrylamide.",Excluded,0.8703488

This combined regimen prolongs patient survival, but also carries a substantial risk for delayed neurotoxicity particularly in the elderly. However, cognitive outcome evaluations have not been included in most clinical trials.OBJECTIVE: To assess cognitive functioning and quality of life in PCNSL survivors treated either with WBRT +/- MTX-based chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone.METHODS: Twenty-eight PCNSL patients in disease remission received a post-treatment baseline neuropsychological evaluation, and a subset of patients were available for an 8-month follow-up evaluation. Assessment of quality of life and extent of white matter disease on MRI were also performed.RESULTS: Patients displayed mild to moderate impairments across several cognitive domains. These were of sufficient severity to reduce quality of life in half of the patient sample. Comparisons according to treatment type revealed more pronounced cognitive impairment, particularly in the memory and attention/executive domains, among patients treated with WBRT +/- chemotherapy. Extent of white matter disease correlated with attention/executive, memory, and language impairment.CONCLUSIONS: PCNSL survivors treated with WBRT +/- chemotherapy displayed more pronounced cognitive dysfunction than patients treated with MTX-based chemotherapy alone.",Excluded,0.8220216

There are less data on what happens to ANs that have initially been shown to grow on scans if left untreated. Radiation treatments can arrest growth of newly diagnosed ANs, but again, data are sparse that look specifically at the subset of ANs that have shown documented growth before radiation treatments. We reviewed our local experience with growing ANs, both what happens if left untreated and the control rate with radiation treatments. Result(s): Of those ANs that have been documented to have grown, 65% continued to grow, 30% stopped growing, and 5% decreased in size. After a mean follow-up of 60 months, 17% of the growing ANs treated with radiation continued to grow, 24% remained stable, and 59% reduced in size. Conclusion(s): There appears to be a subset of ANs that, despite showing initial growth, can stabilize in follow-up, and that radiation treatment does work but much less effectively when only those tumors that have documented prior growth are reviewed. There may be some support for the idea that radiation may be taking credit for what, in part, is the natural history of these tumors.",Excluded,0.75943184
888,"X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region of two-component heterokaryons of Neurospora crassa. VIII. Dose-dependence of the overall spectrum There is considerable controversy in the literature concerning the nature of X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in various experimental organisms. To investigate this problem in Neurospora crassa a series of experiments (Webber and de Serres, 1965) was performed to study the induction-kinetics of X-ray-induced mutation in the adenine-3 (ad-3) region of a two-component heterokaryon (H-12). Subsequent genetic analyses (de Serres, 1989a,b,c, 1990a), on a series of 832 mutants recovered in these experiments, have shown that 3 different classes of ad-3 mutants were recovered, namely gene/point mutations, multilocus deletions and multiple-site mutations. Complementation studies with a series of genetic markers that define 21 genetic loci in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent genetic regions have shown that ad-3 mutants classified as multilocus deletions result from the inactivation of a series of loci in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent regions of Linkage Group I, whereas multiple-locus mutations result from combinations of gene/point mutations and multilocus deletions. Analysis of the induction kinetics of these 3 different classes, after completion of the genetic characterization of all mutants (de Serres, 1990b) demonstrated that gene/point mutations increase linearly with X-ray dose, whereas multilocus deletions and multiple-site mutations increase as the square of X-ray dose. Further analysis of allelic complementation among the gene/point mutations at the ad-3B locus (de Serres, 1990c), demonstrated that the spectrum of complementation patterns was dose-dependent: complementing mutants with nonpolarized patterns decreased and noncomplementing mutations increased with increasing X-ray dose. There was little or no change with dose in the frequency of mutants with polarized patterns. In the present report, data from studies published previously have been utilized, along with additional data from the original X-ray experiments (12-5, 12-6, 12-7, and 12-10; see Webber and de Serres, 1965) to develop composite complementation maps of the X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent regions as a function of X-ray dose. This analysis of the overall spectrum of X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region demonstrated marked dose-dependence and provides an explanation for the discrepancies in the literature with regard to specific-locus studies in different experimental organisms.",Excluded,0.7330893

Although it can be curative, the pre-transplant conditioning regimen can be associated with neurotoxicity. In this prospective study, we examined white matter (WM) integrity with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological functioning before and one year after HSCT in twenty-two patients with hematologic disorders and ten healthy controls evaluated at similar intervals. Eighteen patients received conditioning treatment with high-dose (HD) chemotherapy, and four had full dose total body irradiation (fTBI) and HD chemotherapy prior to undergoing an allogeneic or autologous HSCT. The results showed a significant decrease in mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AD) in diffuse WM regions one year after HSCT (p-corrected <0.05) in the patient group compared to healthy controls. At baseline, patients treated with allogeneic HSCT had higher MD and AD in the left hemisphere WM than autologous HSCT patients (p-corrected <0.05). One year post-transplant, patients treated with allogeneic HSCT had lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher radial diffusivity (RD) in the right hemisphere and left frontal WM compared to patients treated with autologous HSCT (p-corrected <0.05). There were modest but significant correlations between MD values and cognitive test scores, and these were greatest for timed tests and in projection tracts. Patients showed a trend toward a decline in working memory, and had lower cognitive test scores than healthy controls at the one-year assessment.

To explore new potential biological risk factors for glioblastoma, we investigated alterations in metabolite concentrations in pre-diagnosed serum samples from glioblastoma patients diagnosed up to 22 years after sample collection, and undiseased controls. The study points out a latent biomarker for future glioblastoma consisting of nine metabolites (gamma-tocopherol, alpha-tocopherol, erythritol, erythronic acid, myo-inositol, cystine, 2-keto-L-gluconic acid, hypoxanthine and xanthine) involved in antioxidant metabolism. We detected significantly higher serum concentrations of alpha-tocopherol (p=0.0018) and gamma-tocopherol (p=0.0009) in future glioblastoma cases. Compared to their matched controls, the cases showed a significant average fold increase of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol levels: 1.2 for alpha-T (p=0.018) and 1.6 for gamma-T (p=0.003).

It can be done with surgery, radiotherapy or just expectation. Aim(s): The objective of this paper was to evaluate the effectiveness and complications of radiotherapy. Study design: clinical with transversal cohort. Material(s) and Method(s): It was made a retrospective review in the charts of the patients with glomus jugulare tumors treated with radiotherapy. Disease control was determined by (1) no progression of symptoms or cranial nerve dysfunction or (2) no progression of the lesion in radiological follow-up. It was also evaluated the follow-up period and the sequelae of the treatment. Result(s): Twelve patients were included, 8 of then women. The follow-up period was from 3 to 35 years, with a media of 11,6 years. The main symptoms were: hearing loss, pulsate tinnitus, dizziness and vertigo. The signs were pulsate retrotympanic mass, facial palsy and cofosis. The tumors were staged using Fisch's classification. The radiotherapy was performed with linear accelerator with dose ranging from 4500-5500 in 4-6 weeks. In the follow-up period were possible to identify sequelaes like dermatitis, meatal stenosis, cofosis and facial palsy. Discussion(s): The signs and symptoms were the same found in the medical literature. The type and dosages of the radiotherapy were also the same of others reports. All patients had improvement of the symptoms and only one was not considered as having disease controlled. Complications were, in general, minor complications, with exception of the cofosis and facial palsy.

Demographic data, IDH and 1p19q status, and treatment factors were analyzed for association with PsP, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Sixty-five patients were treated with photons and 34 with protons. Among those with oligodendroglioma, PsP developed in 6/42 photon-treated patients (14.3%) and 4/25 proton-treated patients (16%, p = 1.00). Among those with astrocytoma, PsP developed in 3/23 photon-treated patients (13%) and 1/9 proton-treated patients (11.1%, p = 1.00). There was no difference in PsP rate based on radiation type, radiation dose, tumor grade, 1p19q codeletion, or IDH status. PsP occurred earlier in oligodendroglioma patients treated with protons compared to photons, 48 days vs. 131 days, p <.01. On multivariate analyses, gross total resection (p =.03, HR = 0.48, 95%CI = 0.25-0.93) and PsP (p =.04, HR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.05-0.91) were associated with better PFS; IDH mutation was associated with better OS (p <.01, HR = 0.22, 95%CI = 0.08-0.65). Conclusion(s): Patients with oligodendroglioma but not astrocytoma develop PsP earlier after protons compared to photons. PsP was associated with better PFS.

812,"MPTP in mice: treatment, distribution and possible source of contamination Mice were treated daily with [3H]MPTP (30 mg/kg, 1 uCi, s.c.) for 1, 3, and 10 days to determine the fate and localization of tritiated compounds. An untreated mouse was housed either in the same cage (""cage-mate control"") or in an adjacent cage separated by mesh-wire (""near-neighbor control""). The radioactivity measured in blood, brain, liver, and remaining body of [3H]MPTP-treated mice was dependent on the total dose of the drug the animals received and did not vary with the type of tissue analyzed. Significant amounts of radioactivity were found in the tissues of the ""cage-mate control"" mice, but not of the ""near-neighbor control"" mice. The route of transmission appears to be through the urine, as the urine of [3H]MPTP-treated mice was highly radioactive after the drug injection. Only traces of radioactivity were found in their feces and there was no increase in the background radiation in the environment of the cages, indicating that the tritiated compounds were not exhaled. Proper disposal of urinary products of MPTP-treated animals is therefore necessary to reduce the risk of possible drug contamination in humans.",Excluded,0.57359225

1105,"Maximum response and PCI are important prognostic factors in LD SCLC patients staged with cMRI Purpose or Objective: The role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited disease (LD) small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) has proven to significantly decrease the incidence of brain metastases (BMs) with only modest improvement of overall survival. Material(s) and Method(s): To evaluate the impact of PCI on survival we reviewed 179 LD SCLC patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in the concurrent or sequential setting. PCI was applied in the partial and complete responders exclusively provided contrast-enhanced cranial magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) before and after primary treatment showed no signs of occult BMs. Correlation between PCI and time to progression (TTP) as well as overall survival (OS) was analysed. Kaplan-Meier analysis, uni- and multivariate Cox regression were used to describe survival within subgroups defined by treatment response and application of PCI. Result(s): Concurrent and sequential chemoradiotherapy CRT was applied in 71 (40%) and 108 (60%) patients, respectively. In 58 (32%) patients metachronous BMs were detected. PCI was applied in 71 (39%) patients. 15 patients developed BMs after PCI. Median TTP and OS in responders treated with PCI were 812 and 801 compared to 355 (range: 284 - 456) (p < 0.0001, log-rank test) and 385 (range: 318 - 452) (p < 0.0001, log-rank test) days in the rest of the patient cohort. In multivariate analysis, application of PCI in treatment responders comprehensively staged with cMRI was a variable that significantly correlated with TTP (HR 2.16 CI HR 1.37- 3.42, p < 0.001) and OS (HR 1.89 CI HR 1.37-2.63, p < 0.0001) after adjustment of other patient- and treatment-related factors. Conclusion(s): In this LD SCLC patient cohort comprehensively staged with cMRI, achievement of maximum treatment response and application of PCI significantly affects time to progression and overall survival.",Excluded,0.5537042
901,"Toxicity profile of spine stereotactic radiosurgery among long-term survivors Purpose/Objective(s): To characterize toxicity risk profiles in long-term survivors (>4 years) after spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS). Long-term oncologic control outcomes have been previously reported. This study represents the largest series reporting long-term toxicity profiles after SSRS. Materials/Methods: From December 2002 to June 2011, 228 patients with 261 segments were treated with spine stereotactic radiosurgery for metastatic disease. A subset cohort of 53 patients with 59 segments survived a minimum of 4 years after treatment and was analyzed for radiation associated toxicity. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiation morbidity scoring criteria and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0 were used to grade myelopathy, myelitis, radiculopathy, and fracture. Toxicity endpoints occurring in the setting of tumor progression were not attributed to treatment effect. Toxicity development was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Patients were followed clinically and radiographically for a median of 5.6 years (range 49-110 months). SSRS fractionation schemes were 24 Gy in 1 fraction (25%), 18 Gy in 1 fraction (19%), 27 Gy in 3 fractions (32%), 30 Gy in 5 fractions (11%), 16 Gy in 1 fraction (11%), or 22 Gy in 1 fraction (2%). There were 6 sites treated which received prior conventional radiation (10.2%). Three patients (5%) required additional surgery due to tumor progression while 8 (13.6%) received additional palliative radiation. Long-term treatment related toxicity events included one case of Grade 4 myelopathy resulting in hemi-cord syndrome (1.7%), which occurred 13 months after therapy. Sensory radiculopathy occurred in 5 cases (8.5%) at a median of 12.8 months (range 2.5-25.4), of which, 2 required intrathecal pain pumps for symptom management. Eight treated segments (13.6%) involving 7 patients developed vertebral body collapse and/or endplate fracture at a median 7.5 months (range 0.6-49.2) with 6 (10.2%) requiring either percutaneous vertebroplasty or surgery. Overall, in this subset cohort of long-term survivors, a toxicity event was observed in 15 cases (25%) of which 9 (15%) were at least grade 3. The majority of events (53%) were vertebral fracture. Forty percent of toxicity occurred beyond 12 months of therapy (median 10 months) with events being observed beyond 2 years (radiculopathy) and even 4 years (vertebral fracture) later. Combined grade 3+ neurological toxicity occurred in 5.6% of long-term survivors at a median of 12.7 months after treatment. Conclusion(s): Spine stereotactic radiosurgery appears to have a favorable late toxicity profile even amongst a selected cohort of long-term survivors. The overwhelming majority of events occur within 2 years of treatment. Very late toxicity beyond 4 years occurred in 1/59 treated sites and consisted of a vertebral body fracture. There were no very late neurological toxicities beyond 4 years. Overall, these data support the durable safety of the technique.",Excluded,0.5215779
808,"Effect of Neoadjuvant Therapy and Rectal Surgery on Health-related Quality of Life in Patients With Rectal Cancer During the First 2 Years After Diagnosis INTRODUCTION: Rectal cancer surgery with neoadjuvant therapy is associated with substantial morbidity. The present study describes the course of quality of life (QOL) in rectal cancer patients in the first 2 years after the start of treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study within a colorectal cancer cohort including rectal cancer patients who were referred for neoadjuvant chemoradiation or short-course radiotherapy and underwent rectal surgery. QOL was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and colorectal cancer questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-CR29) before treatment and after 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The outcomes were compared with the QOL scores from the Dutch general population and stratified by low anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection. Postoperative bowel dysfunction after low anterior resection was measured using the low anterior resection syndrome score.RESULTS: Of the 324 patients, 272 (84%) responded to at least 2 questionnaires and were included in the present study. Compared with pretreatment levels, the strongest decline was observed in physical, role, and social functioning at 3 and 6 months after the start of treatment. Global health and cognitive functioning declined to a lesser extend, and emotional functioning gradually improved over the time. Within 24 months, the QOL scores had recovered toward the pretreatment levels in most patients. Compared with the general population, physical, role, social, and cognitive functioning and symptoms of fatigue and insomnia remained significantly worse in patients on longer-term. After low anterior resection, major bowel dysfunction was reported by 44% to 60% of the patients. Increasing urinary incontinence and severe complaints of impotence were observed in patients who had undergone abdominoperineal resection.CONCLUSION: Rectal cancer treatment is associated with a significant decline in QOL during the first 6 months after the diagnosis. Within 2 years, most patients return toward pretreatment functioning but could still experience poorer functioning and treatment-related symptoms compared with the general population. These findings support shared decision-making and emphasize the need for postoperative supportive care and novel treatment approaches.",Excluded,0.51341397
559,"Differential biodistribution of native and 2 kGy 60Co irradiated crotoxin in tissues of CBA/J mice Crotalus durissus envenomation is treated using antivenins produced in horses. During production, animals have problems, sometimes followed by death, due to the high toxicity of the main toxin, crotoxin. Several methods tested to detoxify this toxin often resulted in decreased immunogenicity. Gamma irradiation has proved to be a successful method for crotoxin detoxification without loss of immunogenicity. We have studied the biodistribution of 2 kGy 60Co irradiated crotoxin (iCTX) in mouse tissues. We used both 125I-labeled iCTX or its detection by a specific immunohistochemistry assay (IHA). Both approaches showed similar early excretion of toxins by the kidneys. Higher iCTX uptake was seen in spleen and liver, which are rich in immune responder cells. In contrast to previous reports concerning native crotoxin (nCTX), we failed to detect iCTX in the neuromuscular junction, but both toxins were found on the kidney tubular cell surface, with rapid excretion that was more intense for iCTX. Kupffer cells and splenocyte macrophages presented IHA staining, as shown by the increased uptake of 125I toxin by these organs. No staining was observed in the brain, lung or heart, which also showed very low 125I counts. Allied to reduced toxicity, irradiation induced early endocytosis of crotoxin by phagocytic cells, improving antigen processing.",Excluded,0.5016141
