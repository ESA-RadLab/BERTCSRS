251,"[Acoustic neuroma in Iceland for 30 years (1979-2009)] INTRODUCTION: Acoustic neuroma (AN) is a tumor of the 8th cranial nerve. The goal of this study was to find the incidence of AN in Iceland from 1979 - 2009 as well as investigate other epidemiological factors.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The group of patients with the AN diagnosis was gathered retrospectively through medical records. We looked at several epidemiological factors including age and symptoms at diagnosis, and the treatment chosen for each individual.RESULTS: The incidence rate of AN in Iceland is 1.24/100,000. About 10% of diagnosed tumors were found incidentally. Most of those were found in the last 10 years of the investigation and in that period fewer large and giant tumors at diagnosis. Present complaints of patients at diagnosis were hearing loss (69%), dysequilibrium/dizziness (47%) and tinnitus (43%). Treatments were surgery (n=47), observation (n=30) and gamma knife radiosurgery (n=16). We had information concerning postoperative hearing loss and facial paralysis in 39 patients who underwent surgery. Loss of hearing postoperatively occurred in 69% (n=27) and 44% (n=17) had facial paralysis. For an average of 3.5 years, 17% of tumors followed by imaging grew.CONCLUSION: The incidence of AN is similar to that in Europe and is increasing. More tumors are found incidentally. Small tumors can be followed by regular imaging, at least for the short term. Larger tumors are treated by surgery or gamma knife radiosurgery. A high percentage of patients receiving surgery lost their hearing postoperatively.",Included,0.09961677
586,"Treatment Outcomes of Incidental Intracranial Meningiomas: Results from the IMPACT Cohort Background: Incidental findings such as meningioma are becoming increasingly prevalent. There is no consensus on the optimal management of these patients. The aim of this study was to examine the outcomes of patients diagnosed with an incidental meningioma who were treated with surgery or radiotherapy. Method(s): Single-center retrospective cohort study of adult patients diagnosed with an incidental intracranial meningioma (2007-2015). Outcomes recorded were postintervention morbidity, histopathologic diagnosis, and treatment response. Result(s): Out of 441 patients, 44 underwent treatment. Median age at intervention was 56.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 49.6-66.5); patients included 35 women and 9 men. The main indication for imaging was headache (25.9%). Median meningioma volume was 4.55 cm<sup>3</sup> (IQR, 1.91-8.61), and the commonest location was convexity (47.7%). Six patients underwent surgery at initial diagnosis. Thirty-eight had intervention (34 with surgery and 4 with radiotherapy) after a median active monitoring duration of 24 months (IQR, 11.8-42.0). Indications for treatment were radiologic progression (n = 26), symptom development (n = 6), and patient preference (n = 12). Pathology revealed World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1 meningioma in 36 patients and WHO grade 2 in 4 patients. The risk of postoperative surgical and medical morbidity requiring treatment was 25%. Early and late moderate adverse events limiting activities of daily living occurred in 28.6% of patients treated with radiotherapy. Recurrence rate after surgery was 2.5%. All meningiomas regressed or remained radiologically stable after radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): The morbidity after treatment of incidental intracranial meningioma is not negligible. Considering most operated tumors are WHO grade 1, treatment should be reserved for those manifesting symptoms or demonstrating substantial growth on radiologic surveillance.

519,"Protection of normal brain cells from gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis by a mitochondria-targeted triphenyl-phosphonium-nitroxide: a possible utility in glioblastoma therapy Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumor. A strong rationale to identify innovative approaches to treat these tumors is required since treatment failures result in local recurrences and median survivals range from 9 to 12 months. Glioma cells are reported to have less mitochondrial content compared to adjacent normal brain cells. Based on this difference, we suggest a new strategy, utilizing protection of normal brain cells by mitochondria-targeted electron scavengers and antioxidants-nitroxides-thus allowing for the escalation of the radiation doses. In this paper, we report that a conjugate of nitroxide with a hydrophobic cation, triphenyl-phosphonium (TPEY-Tempo), significantly protected brain endothelial cells from gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis while radiosensitizing brain tumor cells. Thus, TPEY-Tempo may be a promising adjunct in the treatment of glioblastoma with the potential to not only prolong survival but also to maintain quality of life and reduce treatment toxicity.",Included,0.10912813
689,"Central infusion of the melanocortin receptor antagonist agouti-related peptide (AgRP(83-132)) prevents cachexia-related symptoms induced by radiation and colon-26 tumors in mice Cachexia is a clinical wasting syndrome that occurs in multiple disease states, and is associated with anorexia and a progressive loss of body fat and lean mass. The development of new therapeutics for this disorder is needed due to poor efficacy and multiple side effects of current therapies. The pivotal role played by the central melanocortin system in regulating body weight has made this an attractive target for novel cachexia therapies. The mixed melanocortin receptor antagonist AgRP is an endogenous peptide that induces hyperphagia. Here, we used AgRP(83-132) to investigate the ability of melanocortin antagonism to protect against clinical features of cachexia in two distinct animal models. In an acute model, food intake and body weight gain were reduced in mice exposed to radiation (300 RAD), and delivery of AgRP(83-132) into the lateral cerebral ventricle prevented these effects. In a chronic tumor cachexia model, adult mice were injected subcutaneously with a cell line derived from murine colon-26 adenocarcinoma. Typical of cachexia, tumor-bearing mice progressively reduced body weight and food intake, and gained significantly less muscle mass than controls. Administration of AgRP(83-132) into the lateral ventricles significantly increased body weight and food intake, and changes in muscle mass were similar to the tumor-free control mice. These findings support the idea that antagonism of the central melanocortin system can reduce the negative impact of cachexia and radiation therapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

472,"Quality of life after palliative treatment for oesophageal carcinoma - A prospective comparison between stent placement and single dose brachytherapy Metal stent placement and single dose brachytherapy are commonly used treatment modalities for the palliation of inoperable oesophageal carcinoma. We investigated generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after these palliative treatments. Patients with dysphagia from inoperable oesophageal carcinoma were randomised to placement of a covered Ultraflex stent (n=108) or single dose (12 Gy) brachytherapy (n=101). We obtained longitudinal data on disease-specific (dysphagia score, European Organisation for Reasearch and Treament of Cancer (EORTC) OES-23, visual analogue pain scale) and generic (EORTC Quality of Life-Core 30 Questionnarie (QLQ-C30), Euroqol (EQ)-5D) HRQoL at monthly home visits by a specially-trained research nurse. We compared HRQoL between the two treatments and analysed changes in HRQoL during follow-up. Dysphagia improved more rapidly after stent placement than after brachytherapy, but long-term relief of dysphagia was better after brachytherapy. For generic HRQoL, there was an overall significant difference in favour of brachytherapy on four out of five functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (role, emotional, cognitive and social) (P<0.05). Generic HRQoL deteriorated over time on all functional scales of the EORTC QLQ C-30 and EQ-5D, in particular physical and role functioning (on average -23 and -24 on a 100 points scale during 0.5 years of follow-up). This decline was more pronounced in the stent group. Major improvements were seen on the dysphagia and eating scales of the EORTC OES-23, in contrast to other scales of this disease-specific measure, which remained almost stable during follow-up. Reported levels of chest or abdominal pain remained stable during follow-up in both treatment groups, general pain levels increased to a minor extent. The effects of single dose brachytherapy on HRQoL compared favourably to those of stent placement for the palliation of oesophageal cancer. Future studies on palliative care for oesophageal cancer should at least include generic HRQoL scales, since these were more responsive in measuring patients' functioning and well-being during follow-up than disease-specific HRQoL scales. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

1184,"Long-term outcomes of surgical resection with or without adjuvant radiation therapy for treatment of spinal ependymoma: A retrospective multicenter study by the Korea Spinal Oncology Research Group Background: We sought to determine the surgical treatment and functional outcome and identify the predictors of survival in a retrospective cohort of patients with spinal cord ependymoma using data collected from the Korea Spinal Oncology Research Group database. Method(s): The data regarding 88 patients who had been surgically treated for histologically confirmed spinal cord intramedullary and extramedullary ependymoma from January 1989 to December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): Histopathological examination revealed myxopapillary ependymoma in 24 patients, ependymoma in 61 patients, and anaplastic ependymoma in 3 patients. Gross total removal was achieved in 72 patients, subtotal removal in 15 patients, and partial removal in 1 patient. Twenty patients were treated with postoperative radiation. Fifty-two patients had stable or improved postoperative neurological function, while 36 experienced neurological deterioration. A permanent decrease in McCormick classification grade was seen in 17 patients. The progression-free survival rate was 87% for all patients at 5 years and 80% at 10 years. During follow-up, local recurrence/progression was seen in 13 patients. Diffuse meningeal spread developed in 2 anaplastic ependymoma patients. Postoperative radiotherapy after incomplete resection did not significantly correlate with longer times to recurrence. Multivariate analysis revealed histology and surgical extent of resection as independent predictors of longer progression-free survival. Conclusion(s): Gross total removal alone is a good treatment strategy for spinal ependymomas. Early diagnosis and surgery, before severe paralysis, are important to obtain good functional outcomes. Subtotal resection with radiation therapy for intramedullary lesions appears to offer no advantages over gross total removal. © 2013 The Author(s).",Included,0.13978189
449,"Prevalence of glioblastoma multiforme in subjects with prior therapeutic radiation This retrospective study profiled subjects with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who had previously received therapeutic radiation. A chart review was conducted of 100 adult patients diagnosed with GBM and referred to a major medical center in the southwestern United States. Seventeen patients received previous radiation therapy with an average dose of 48.5 Grey (Gy) and an average latency period of 15 years between initial therapy and GBM diagnosis. Of these 17, four white females fit all four attribution criteria for radiation-induced GBM. Two had been treated with radiation for prolactinomas, one for pinealoma and one for squamous cell cancer of the ethmoid sinus. The addition of these four case studies to the previously published descriptions of 80 cases of gliomas, 36 of which were GBM, subsequent to radiation therapy provides additional support for considering therapeutic radiation as a risk factor for GBM development.",Included,0.16359398
829,"PAK4 governs radiation-induced endothelial GRO-1alpha-CXCR2 signaling and angiogenesis in glioma Aberrant neovascularization is a pathological hallmark of glioblastoma that correlates with poor clinical outcome. Factors that drive endothelial proliferation, recruitment into the tumor and angiogenesis in the context of radiotherapy are potentially novel therapeutic targets for glioma. Our studies showed high expression of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) in gliomas; analyses of conditioned medium (CM) prepared from shRNA-mediated PAK4-knockdown (PAK4.sh) glioma cells using a human angiogenesis array showed a significant downregulation in key angiogenic factors including Gro-1alpha. Treatment of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) with CM from PAK4.sh-cells significantly inhibited endothelial proliferation, migration and microtubule formation compared with controls. PAK4.sh-CM treatment also suppressed CXCR2 receptor activation and decreased the expression levels of p-Stat3, MMP-2 and cyclin D1 in HBMECs. Ionizing radiation (IR, 8 Gy) activated Gro-1alpha-CXCR2 signaling in HBMECs, and induced high levels of endothelial capillary network formation on matrigel. On the other hand, PAK4.sh inhibited IR-induced angiogenesis by decreasing Gro-1alpha and CXCR2 levels in HBMECS. Further, in vivo experiments with orthotopic intracranial tumors in nude mice showed growth suppression in PAK4.sh tumors compared to control tumors. Immunohistochemical analyses of brain tumor sections showed a significant decrease in MMP-2 in PAK4.sh tumors. In summary, our studies emphasize a novel role of PAK4 as a critical mediator of tumor-endothelial cell interactions via Gro-1alpha-CXCR2signaling, and in vivo tumor growth suppression by PAK4 depletion indicates its therapeutic potential in the treatment of glioma.",Included,0.19970605
1138,"[Peculiarities of the neurological status and electroencephalogram in operators of the control unit of nuclear power station] One hundred and five operators of the control unit of the Kursk nuclear power station (NPS) have been studied: 45 people after the shift (main group) and 60 - in the day off. The shift was found to exert a significant influence on the functional state of the nervous system promoting the development or aggravation of autonomous dysfunction. In some cases, it causes an elevation of blood pressure to the level of risk for cerebral vascular disease. The effect of shift on the cerebral bioelectric activity of NPS operators manifests itself in the decrease of percentage of unchanged EEG, increase of alpha-rhythm spectral power density in the parietal leads and theta-rhythm in the posterior temporal and parietal leads. These changes may be caused by weariness as well as the effects of adverse factors the operators were exposed to at the NPS. The authors suggest to include the methods of evaluating of autonomous dysfunction and recording of alpha-rhythm spectral power density in the parietal leads and theta-rhythm in the posterior temporal and parietal leads in a special clinical examination of NPS operators.",Included,0.22663313
324,"Dose-dependent changes in renal (1)H-/(23)Na MRI after adjuvant radiochemotherapy for gastric cancer PURPOSE: Combined radiochemotherapy (RCT) for gastric cancer with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) results in ablative doses to the upper left kidney, while image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) allows kidney sparing despite improved target coverage. Renal function in long-term gastric cancer survivors was evaluated with 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and (23)Na imaging.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five healthy volunteers and 13 patients after radiotherapy were included: 11xIG-IMRT; 1x3D-CRT; 1x ""positive control"" with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of a metastasis between the spleen/left kidney. Radiation doses were documented for the upper/middle/lower kidney subvolumes. Late toxicity was evaluated based on CTC criteria, questionnaire, and creatinine values. Morphological sequences, DWI images, and (23)Na images were acquired using a (1)H/(23)Na-tuned body-coil before/after intravenous water load (WL). Statistics for [(23)Na] (concentration) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated for upper/middle/lower renal subvolumes. Corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradients and [(23)Na] differences after WL were determined.RESULTS: No major morphological alteration was detected in any patient. Minor scars were observed in the cranial subvolume of the left kidney of the 3D-CRT and the whole kidney of the control SBRT patient. All participants presented a corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradient. After WL, a significant physiological [(23)Na] gradient decrease (p < 0.001) was observed in all HV and IG-IMRT patients. In the cranial left kidney of the 3D-CRT patient and the positive control SBRT patient, the decrease was nonsignificant (p = 0.01, p = 0.02). ADC values were altered nonsignificantly in all renal subvolumes (all participants). Renal subvolumes with doses >= 35 Gy showed a reduced change of the [(23)Na] gradient after WL (p = 0.043). No participants showed clinical renal impairment.CONCLUSIONS: Functional parameters of renal (23)Na MRI after gastric IG-IMRT are identical to those of healthy volunteers, in contrast to renal subvolumes after ablative doses in the control and 3D-CRT patient. While kidney doses to the cortex below 20-25 Gy in fractional doses of ~ 1 Gy in IG-IMRT (combined with intensified chemotherapy) do not seem to cause significant MRI morphological or functional alterations, doses of > 35 Gy in 1.5-2 Gy fractions clearly result in impairment.",Included,0.2386199

No significant differences in self-assessed quality of life were found between GBM patients in the course of alpha-therapy and healthy controls, the two groups differed only as regards somatic symptoms. Moreover, the stronger the respondents' sense of self-efficacy, the higher their subjective quality of life.

1204,"Treatment of spinal cord ependymomas by surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of complete resection and postoperative radiotherapy in spinal cord ependymomas. Methods and materials: We conducted a retrospective study over 20 patients (13 males and 7 females) with histologically confirmed spinal cord ependymomas between July 1985 and April 2001. Among them, 13 patients had ependymomas, 6 had myxopapillary ependymomas, and 1 had anaplastic ependymoma. All patients received radical surgery for tumor removal with 13 patients achieving complete resection and 7 incomplete resection due to technical difficulty. Among those with incomplete resection, 6 patients received postoperative radiotherapy to tumor bed and only one patient with anaplastic ependymoma received surgery alone. The total tumor dose ranged from 50 to 60 Gy. Result(s): Among the 20 patients, 19 patients were alive and showed local control. The median survival time of all patients was 109 months, with 104 months in the complete resection alone group and 135 months in the incomplete resection with postoperative radiotherapy group. One patient with anaplastic ependymoma and no postoperative radiotherapy developed leptomeningeal seeding 9 months after surgery. Salvage therapy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy maintained normal neurological functions. The patient expired 34 months from the initial diagnosis due to progression of leptomeningeal seeding. Conclusion(s): Complete resection alone in spinal cord ependymoma can achieve excellent local control and survival. Patients should receive complete resection if technically possible. Postoperative radiotherapy is not recommended for complete resection. For incomplete resection, postoperative local radiotherapy is recommended and it can also achieve excellent local control and survival. Local radiotherapy with 50-60 Gy is effective and safe. Salvage radiotherapy improves quality of life for local recurrence or leptomeningeal seeding patients. © Springer 2005.",Included,0.3140905

1062,"Risk Factor for Incident Functional Disability and the Effect of a Preventive Exercise Program: A 4-Year Prospective Cohort Study of Older Survivors from the Great East Japan Earthquake and Nuclear Disaster OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the risk factors for incident functional disability among long-term evacuees of Iitate village after Great East Japan Earthquake and nuclear disaster (GEJE). We also investigated the effectiveness of exercise classes as an intervention measure in this situation.METHODS: 1159 subjects (75.2 +/- 5.8 years, 57.5% female) were included at baseline, and followed-up for four years. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of incident functional disability according to the presence of risk factors evaluated by the municipality&rsquo;s self-assessment Basic Checklist (BCL). Evacuees from Iitate who participated in the exercise classes and those who did not were matched using the propensity scores, which were then used to obtain the HR of incident functional disability.RESULTS: New functional disability occurred in 280 (24.2%) participants during the follow-up. Participants who scored negative for the &ldquo;Physical function&rdquo; domain in the BCL had a HR of 2.04 (95% CI: 1.54-2.69) for incident functional disability when compared to those who scored positive for this domain. Similarly, the HR for &ldquo;Cognitive function&rdquo; was 1.37 (CI: 1.06-1.77), and 1.60 (CI: 1.24-2.08) for &ldquo;Depression&rdquo;. Using a Cox proportional hazard regression model, both the group with low-participation in the exercise program and the group with high-participation in the exercise program had a significantly lower rate of incident functional disability compared to those who did not participate at all (HR = 0.27, CI: 0.16-0.46; HR = 0.30, CI: 0.12-0.74, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Pre-disaster BCL domains were useful to identify individuals at risk of functional disability after a major socio-technical disaster. Therefore, this instrument can be used to identify at-risk older adults who would benefit from early exercise programs to prevent incident functional disability.",Included,0.34219334
825,"The role of radiation and chemotherapy in adult patients with high-grade brainstem gliomas: results from the National Cancer Database INTRODUCTION: Surgical resection of high-grade brainstem gliomas is challenging and treatment mostly involves radiation and chemotherapy. In this study, we utilized registry data to determine prognostic features and impact of chemotherapy and radiation on overall survival.METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried from 2006 to 2015 for adult cases with histologically confirmed high-grade brainstem glioma. Covariates including patient demographics, comorbidities, tumor characteristics and treatment parameters were captured. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to identify predictors of survival.RESULTS: A total of 422 patients were analyzed. Most patients (66.6%) underwent postoperative radiation with chemotherapy, 9.2% underwent radiation alone, while the remaining had no postoperative treatment (24.2%). Overall median survival was 9.8 months (95% CI 8.8-12). Survival was longer (p < 0.001) in the radiation + chemotherapy group (median: 14.2 months, 95% CI 11.7-17.1) compared to radiation alone (median: 5.7 months, 95% CI 3.7-12) and no postoperative treatment (median: 1.8 months, 95% CI 1.4-4) groups. In multivariable analysis, increasing age was associated with worse survival (HR: 1.87, 95% CI 1.47-2.37, p < 0.001), whereas radiation + chemotherapy was associated with lower mortality compared to radiation alone (HR: 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.98, p = 0.038). In subgroup analysis, postoperative chemotherapy with radiation was associated with significant survival benefit compared to radiation alone for grade IV (HR: 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.76, p = 0.003), but not for grade III tumors (HR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.48-1.58, p = 0.65).CONCLUSION: Analysis from a national registry illustrated the effectiveness of radiation with chemotherapy for adult patients with high-grade brainstem gliomas, particularly grade IV. Further research should identify specific patient profiles and molecular subgroups that are more likely to benefit from multimodality therapy.",Included,0.48226777
419,"Requirement for Atm in ionizing radiation-induced cell death in the developing central nervous system Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration that results from mutation of the ATM gene. However, neither the normal function of ATM in the nervous system nor the biological basis of the degeneration in AT is known. Resistance to apoptosis in the developing central nervous system (CNS) of Atm-/- mice was observed after ionizing radiation. This lack of death occurred in diverse regions of the CNS, including the cerebellum, which is markedly affected in AT. In wild-type, but not Atm-/- mice, up-regulation of p53 coincided with cell death, suggesting that Atm-dependent apoptosis in the CNS is mediated by p53. Further, p53 null mice showed a similar lack of radiation-induced cell death in the developing nervous system. Atm may function at a developmental survival checkpoint that serves to eliminate neurons with excessive DNA damage.",Included,0.494895
