47,"Short- and long-term effects of low-dose prenatal X-irradiation in mouse cerebral cortex, with special reference to neuronal migration To elucidate the short- and long-term effects of ionizing radiation on cell migration in the developing cerebral cortex, we labeled proliferating cells on day 14 of gestation of mice with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) followed by a single exposure to 0.1-1 Gy of X-rays. The brains of embryos on day 17 and offspring at 2, 3 and 8 weeks after birth were processed for BrdU immunohistochemistry to trace the movements of BrdU-labeled cells. The location of BrdU-labeled neurons in the cerebral cortex was quantitatively analyzed between irradiated animals and non-irradiated controls. We have demonstrated that the initial migration of BrdU-labeled cells from the matrix cell zone towards the cortical plate during embryonic periods was decelerated when exposed to X-rays of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 Gy on embryonic day 14, and that aberrantly placed neurons in the cerebral neocortex were noted in younger animals that were irradiated prenatally, whereas such derangement was less pronounced in mature animals. These observations suggest that some modification process might have occurred during the postnatal period.",Excluded,0.96839094

225,"Ultrastructural morphometry of parotid acinar cells following fractionated irradiation The aim of this study was to evaluate the long term effects on the ultrastructure of parotid glands after fractionated irradiation. The method implemented involved 5 x 6 Gy and 5 x 8 Gy, Monday to Friday 6 MV photons. By unilateral irradiation, the contralateral parotid gland served as a control. Although irradiation diminished the acinar cell density in light microscopic sections from 75 to 32% after 5 x 8 Gy of irradiation, ultrastructural morphometry could not detect any statistically significant differences in acinar cell size, nuclear size, nuclear density, granule area, mean granule size, or granule density. In general, greater differences were seen between rats receiving 30 or 40 Gy, on both the irradiated and the control size, than between the irradiated side and the control side. This was interpreted as due to differences in the nutritional state of the animals. This analysis concluded that individual acinar cells that survive irradiation seem not to be damaged in the long term when evaluated at the ultrastructural level. The study further stresses the importance of adequate sampling sizes and the use of adequate controls.",Excluded,0.9681008
877,"Effect of in utero radiation dose fractionation on rat postnatal development, behavior and brain structure: 3-Hour interval We have previously shown that exposure of the rat fetus to ionizing radiation produces dose-dependent (0.25-1.25 Gy) changes in postnatal growth and behavior, and decreases in cerebral cortex thickness. Pregnant rats were exposed to single doses of 0.5 or 1.0 Gy, or to two doses of 0.5 Gy (separated by a 3 h interval) on gestational day 15. Pups were weighed and subjected to behavioral tests (righting reflex; reflex suspension; negative geotaxis; continuous corridor; and length, width, and sine of gait) over postnatal days 7-28. The rats were then sacrificed and brains removed for histology. The fractionated doses produced responses that were generally intermediate between those produced by the single doses and which, by interpolation, could be expressed as equivalent to a single dose between 0.5 and 1.0 Gy. Overall, exposure of the fetal rat to two doses of 0.5 Gy separated by 3 h produced effects equivalent to a single dose of 0.85 Gy. We conclude that fractionation of radiation dose results in less damage to the developing rat cerebral cortex, as measured by postnatal growth, behavioral tests, and morphological assessment.",Excluded,0.9680886

571,"Experimental approaches to radiation-induced developmental abnormalities of the brain The developing mammalian brain is highly susceptible to ionizing radiation. Significant increases in microcephalus, heterotopic cortical gray matter, and mental retardation have been noted in prenatally exposed survivors of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with the highest risk in those exposed during 8-15 weeks after fertilization. This stage corresponds to day 15 of pregnancy for rats and day 13 for mice in terms of brain development. The initial damage produced by radiation at this stage is cell death in the ventricular zone of the brain mantle, the radiosensitive germinal cell population. Disturbances in the production of neuronal germinal cells, and their migration to the cerebral cortex, give rise to malformations of the brain, such as microcephalus, an absent corpus callosum, disorganized cortical architecture, and heterotopic gray matter. Histological abnormalities are produced by about 500 mGy or more, and reduced brain weight is produced by 250 mGy or more. Mitotic delay, on the other hand, in the ventricular cells is caused by 100 mGy or more. A similar threshold level is suggested in human cases in the induction of mental retardation. The lowest doses of X- and gamma-radiation that induce detectable biological effects in rats and mice are around 30 mGy in increasing acute cell death.",Excluded,0.9676577
941,"Nuclear and chromatin lipids: metabolism in normal and gamma-irradiated rats The data on nuclear and chromatin lipid metabolism are reviewed. The amount of neutral lipids and phospholipids in nuclei of rat thymus, liver and neocortex neuron as well as the amount of lipids in rat thymus and liver chromatin are described. The metabolic responses of nuclear and chromatin lipids from thymus to different doses and dose rates of gamma-irradiation of rats are discussed. In most cases, the nuclear and chromatin lipid responses are distinct. Changes in nuclear and chromatin lipid metabolism in response to gamma-irradiation are suggested to connect with the signal transduction pathway and the regulation of the transcriptional and replicative chromatin activity. The influence of beta-carotene and picrotoxin on rat liver nuclear lipids and neocortex neuronal nuclear lipids, respectively, was analyzed. The possible involvement of the lipid traffic in the chromatin lipid responses to gamma-irradiation and other agents is suggested. [References: 66]",Excluded,0.96745527
306,"Maturation of the GFAP-immunopositive glial network is delayed in the olfactory bulbs of rats subjected to early, low-dose X-irradiation Young rats were subjected to low-level, repeated doses of x-irradiation from a Co60 source and examined for the presence and arrangement of their GFAP-immunopositive system at the light and electron microscopic levels. In 2-week-old control rats, labelled cells were already distributed homogeneously throughout the bulb, while in the experimental animals, a (newborn- and early postnatal-type) radial arrangement of immunoreactive fibres continued to persist even until the end of the fourth postnatal week. This delay in the maturation of the GFAP-immunopositive glial system may contribute to the hindered development of the bulbar neurones, neuronal connections, and field potentials, as found in earlier studies.",Excluded,0.9674049

A. Gilmore, J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 22, 294-301 (1963). J. A. Beal and J. L. Hall, J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 33, 128-143 (1974)]. The results from our investigation indicate that this reduction in myelin content can be attributed to a decrease in sulfatide synthesis. Rats received whole-brain irradiation with 0, 500, 1500, 2000, or 2500 rad at 4 days postnatal (dpn). All of the rats exposed to 2000 or 2500 rad and 70% of those exposed to 1500 rad died within 6 to 10 days. At 17 dpn, animals received single intraperitoneal injections of [35S]sodium sulfate. Myelin synthesis, as indexed by the incorporation of sulfate into total lipids and glycolipids, was reduced in a dose-related fashion. To demonstrate a direct effect of ionizing radiation on myelinogenesis, brain cell reaggregate cultures derived from fetal rats were exposed at 12 days in vitro (div) to 0, 250, 500, 1000, or 1500 rad. A dose-related reduction in [35S]sulfate incorporation through 21 div was demonstrated. Reaggregates exposed to 250 or 500 rad but not 1000 or 1500 rad resumed normal myelin synthesis by 28 div.

198,"Effect of internal irradiation on the maturing Purkinje cells in the rat. A Golgi study Continuous irradiation in utero is reported to produce mental retardation and gross abnormalities of the brain in the human. A few experimental studies conducted so far also report gross brain defects in animals exposed to continuous irradiation in utero. Despite the increasing use of nuclear energy for power and radioisotopes in medicine, there is hardly any literature available on the effect of continuous irradiation on the structural details of the developing brain. After intraperitoneal injections of different doses of 131I (8, 18 and 32 microCi) and 32P (10 microCi) in new-born rats on the 6th postnatal day, cerebella stained by Golgi techniques were cut sagittally and the sections were examined on the 10th, 15th and 21st postnatal days. In the animals injected with 18 and 32 microCi of 131I and 10 microCi of 32P a large number of Purkinje cells showed morphological alterations not seen in the control groups or in the groups injected with 8 microCi of 131I. The changes observed included persistence of the perisomatic processes beyond the 10th postnatal day, multiple primary dendrites, angulation of the primary dendrites, long segments of primary dendrites without branches and significantly reduced dendritic volume. The number of affected cells was less on the 21st postnatal day. The effective radiation dose estimated in these groups ranged from 15 to 26 rad. Since the rats irradiated with 6 rad had not shown such changes it is believed that there is a threshold dose of radiation beyond which only changes are perceptible at neuronal level.",Excluded,0.96728945

To investigate prostaglandin- induced radiation protection against alopecia, the hair of B6D2F<inf>1</inf> male mice was plucked from the right thigh and surrounding area to induce anagen. Fourteen days later, mice were injected subcutaneously in the neck with 10 mug 16,16 dm PGE<inf>2</inf> in 0.2 ml of vehicle, or with the vehicle alone.

On day 21 post-plucking, all animals were killed and a portion of the irradiated site was excised. The average hair counts per field in irradiated animals were 85 +/- 4 (6.5 Gy), 25 +/- 5 (8.5 Gy), and 5.5 +/- 0.7 (10 Gy). Animals receiving the prostaglandin systemically had values of 60 +/- 10 (6.5 Gy), 54 +/- 3 (8.5 Gy), 66 +/- 6 (10 Gy), and 30.1 +/- 8 (12.5 Gy).

108,"Zebrafish as a ""biosensor""? Effects of ionizing radiation and amifostine on embryonic viability and development The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a popular vertebrate model system for cancer and treatment-related research. Benefits include ease of care, rapid development, optical clarity of embryos, which allows visualization of major organ systems, and opportunities for genetic manipulation. However, specific parameters of radiation sensitivity have not been systematically documented. We investigated the effects of radiation and a radiomodifier on zebrafish viability and embryonic development. Embryos were exposed to gamma-radiation (5, 10, or 20 Gy) at sequential times postfertilization and serially assessed for viability and morphologic abnormalities. As expected, lethality and morphologic perturbations were more pronounced earlier in embryogenesis and with higher radiation doses and were partially reversed by amifostine. The effects of radiation and concurrent treatment with amifostine on the developmental organization of the eye and brain were striking. Radiation resulted in hypocellularity and disorganization of the cellular layers of the retina, effects partially reversed by amifostine, as well as lens opacification. Radiation strikingly reduced the volume of brain, but the volume loss was substantially blocked by amifostine. Increased terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling signal was noted in both the irradiated eye and brain, but reduced by amifostine. Finally, irradiating embryos resulted in caspase activation detectable in 96-well microplates, which was proportional to the number of embryos and radiation dose; the degree of activation was markedly reduced by amifostine. These results together suggest the power and versatility of the zebrafish in assessing the effects of radiation and radiomodifiers on organ and tissue development.",Excluded,0.96701324

A curative therapeutic effect of proton therapy which was low with respect to reproductive function recovery, was combined with lowered functional reserves of hypophyseal thyrotrophs and gonadotrophs.

401,"Prenatal pathogenesis of hydro-micrencephaly induced by X-rays. An animal model Experimental results are presented which describe induction and pathogenesis of the hydro-micrencephaly in NMRI-mice after single X-irradiation with 0.9 Gy or 1.9 Gy on gestation day (gd) 12. The ultrastructural alterations in the ventricular walls are sequentially investigated up to gross developmental damage. The ventricular zone is the most sensitive region in the developing brain. Its constituting undifferentiated and proliferating cells lose their palisade like orientation and fail subsequently to differentiate into primitive neurons, glia cells, or ependymal cells. Structurally this results in the thinning of ventricular walls by more than 50% associated with periventricular oedema and a dilation of the brain ventricles by 20-60%. Damage is clearly more pronounced with the higher dose. Repair processes originate from regions with intact Zonulae adherents which give also rise to typical globular or cylindrical heterotopic structures; these are known as rosettes and made up from undifferentiated proliferating ventricular cells. Perinatally in these rosettes cell replication persists, at a time when cell production in the ventricular zone has ceased. Histological changes are most prominent in and around the telencephalic roof consisting in replacement of the ependymal lining by a felt of glial fibers, faulty myelinisation, and periventricular oedema; postnatally these structural alterations lead to hydro-micrencephaly. Results from this animal model can be translated to the human situation because the fundamental developmental processes in the brain of mammals are similar despite species related differences of the time scale.",Excluded,0.9663929
154,"The role of nitric oxide in the radiation-induced effects in the developing brain The immature and adult brain display clear differences in the way they respond to insults. The effects of prenatal irradiation on the developing brain are well known. Both epidemiological and experimental data indicate that ionizing radiation may disrupt developmental processes leading to deleterious effects on post-natal brain functions. A central role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) as important mediators in both neurotoxicity and neuroprotection has been demonstrated. However, data concerning the role of ROS/RNS in radiation-induced damage in the developing brain are scarce. The goal of this review was to summarize the current studies concerning the role of nitric oxide and its reactive intermediates in activation of signal transduction pathways involved in cellular radiation response, with particular focus on radiation-induced effects in the developing brain.

Although cell sorting could effectively exclude these proliferative cells, from the viewpoint of clinical application, there exists no adequate coping strategy in the case of their contamination. In this study, we analyzed a component of proliferative cells in the grafts of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitors and investigated the effect of radiation therapy on tumor formation. In our differentiating protocol, analyses of neural progenitors (day 19) revealed that the proliferating cells expressed early neural markers (SOX1, PAX6) or a dopaminergic neuron progenitor marker (FOXA2). When grafted into the rat striatum, these immature neurons gradually became postmitotic in the brain, and the rosette structures disappeared at 14 weeks. However, at 4-8 weeks, the SOX1(+)PAX6(+) cells formed rosette structures in the grafts, suggesting their tumorigenic potential. Therefore, to develop a fail-safe therapy against tumor formation, we investigated the effect of radiation therapy. At 4 weeks posttransplantation, when KI67(+) cells comprised the highest ratio, radiation therapy with (137)Cs Gammacell Exactor for tumor-bearing immunodeficient rats showed a significant decrease in graft volume and percentage of SOX1(+)KI67(+) cells in the graft, thus demonstrating the preventive effect of gamma-ray irradiation against tumorigenicity.

High-energy radiation bombardment of intact frozen telencephalon resulted in a biphasic inactivation curve for [3H]AMPA binding. At a 5.8-Mrad radiation dose, the affinity of [3H]AMPA binding was increased (54 nM), but there was no apparent alteration in the Bmax value (2.76 pmol/mg of protein). We attribute this phenomenon to the inactivation of a high molecular weight modulatory protein that down-regulates the affinity of [3H]AMPA binding. The estimated molecular masses of the AMPA binding site and of the modulatory component were 59 and 108 kDa, respectively. Solubilisation with n-octyl-beta-glucopyranoside resulted in an increase in the Bmax (4.7 pmol/mg of protein) with no pronounced alteration in the affinity (109 nM) of [3H]AMPA binding. However, the solubilisation-induced increase in Bmax did not occur in telencephalon irradiated before solubilisation. In contrast, the increase in affinity induced by radiation treatment was still detected in solubilised extracts. These results suggest that the number and affinity of [3H]AMPA sites in chick telencephalon are closely regulated and that the modulatory systems involved are affected by both irradiation and solubilisation.",Excluded,0.9627471
273,"Radiation Induced Metabolic Alterations Associate With Tumor Aggressiveness and Poor Outcome in Glioblastoma Glioblastoma (GBM) is uniformly fatal with a 1-year median survival, despite best available treatment, including radiotherapy (RT). Impacts of prior RT on tumor recurrence are poorly understood but may increase tumor aggressiveness. Metabolic changes have been investigated in radiation-induced brain injury; however, the tumor-promoting effect following prior radiation is lacking. Since RT is vital to GBM management, we quantified tumor-promoting effects of prior RT on patient-derived intracranial GBM xenografts and characterized metabolic alterations associated with the protumorigenic microenvironment. Human xenografts (GBM143) were implanted into nude mice 24 hrs following 20 Gy cranial radiation vs. sham animals. Tumors in pre-radiated mice were more proliferative and more infiltrative, yielding faster mortality (p < 0.0001). Histologic evaluation of tumor associated macrophage/microglia (TAMs) revealed cells with a more fully activated ameboid morphology in pre-radiated animals. Microdialyzates from radiated brain at the margin of tumor infiltration contralateral to the site of implantation were analyzed by unsupervised liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In pre-radiated animals, metabolites known to be associated with tumor progression (i.e., modified nucleotides and polyols) were identified. Whole-tissue metabolomic analysis of pre-radiated brain microenvironment for metabolic alterations in a separate cohort of nude mice using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR revealed a significant decrease in levels of antioxidants (glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (ASC)), NAD<sup>+</sup>, Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates, and rise in energy carriers (ATP, GTP). GSH and ASC showed highest Variable Importance on Projection prediction (VIPpred) (1.65) in Orthogonal Partial least square Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA); Ascorbate catabolism was identified by GC-MS. To assess longevity of radiation effects, we compared survival with implantation occurring 2 months vs. 24 hrs following radiation, finding worse survival in animals implanted at 2 months. These radiation-induced alterations are consistent with a chronic disease-like microenvironment characterized by reduced levels of antioxidants and NAD<sup>+</sup>, and elevated extracellular ATP and GTP serving as chemoattractants, promoting cell motility and vesicular secretion with decreased levels of GSH and ASC exacerbating oxidative stress. Taken together, these data suggest IR induces tumor-permissive changes in the microenvironment with metabolomic alterations that may facilitate tumor aggressiveness with important implications for recurrent glioblastoma.

It either did not form a tumor, or grew into a small encapsulated tumor, and did not cause death or neurological deficits in the animals. Gamma-irradiation of the animals (head only) with implanted C6#11 induced a fully developed invasive tumor that killed them within 25 days. Three grays of radiation of C6#11 cells two hours prior to implantation induced their tumorigenicity as well.

Anesthetized female Fisher 344 rats received irradiation to 2 cm of the cervical spine with a telecobalt unit (dose rate 1.14 Gy/min). Radiation was administered in two, four or eight fractions spread over a 48-h period with or without fludarabine. Animals assigned to combined therapy received two daily intraperitoneal injections of fludarabine (150 mg/kg) given 3 h prior to the first daily radiation fraction. It was found that fludarabine reduced the iso-effect dose required to induce leg paresis at 9 months after irradiation for all fractionation schedules. Dose modification factors of 1.23, 1.29 and greater than 1.27 were obtained for two, four and eight fractions, respectively. Fitting the data with the direct analysis method of Thames et al. with an incomplete repair model [18] showed that the potentiating effect of fludarabine may be mediated through reduction in the number of 'tissue-rescuing units' (InK). Alpha and beta values were slightly but not significantly decreased, whereas the alpha/beta ratio was unchanged. These features suggest that fludarabine did not significantly inhibit cellular repair processes but rather reduced the spinal cord tolerance by a fixed additive toxic effect on the same target cells. In rodent models, the combination of fludarabine and fractionated radiation has previously been found to yield a therapeutic gain, i.e., the drug enhanced tumor response to a greater extent than it reduced normal tissue tolerance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded,0.9604675
8,"Local irradiation not only induces homing of human mesenchymal stem cells at exposed sites but promotes their widespread engraftment to multiple organs: A study of their quantitative distribution after irradiation damage Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to migrate to various tissues. There is little information on the fate and potential therapeutic efficacy of the reinfusion of MSCs following total body irradiation (TBI). We addressed this question using human MSC (hMSCs) infused to nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice submitted to TBI. Further, we tested the impact of additional local irradiation (ALI) superimposed to TBI, as a model of accidental irradiation. NOD/SCID mice were transplanted with hMSCs. Group 1 was not irradiated before receiving hMSC infusion. Group 2 received only TBI at a dose of 3.5 Gy, group 3 received local irradiation to the abdomen at a dose of 4.5 Gy in addition to TBI, and group 4 received local irradiation to the leg at 26.5 Gy in addition to TBI. Fifteen days after irradiation, quantitative and spatial distribution of the hMSCs were studied. Histological analysis of mouse tissues confirmed the presence of radio-induced lesions in the irradiated fields. Following their infusion into nonirradiated animals, hMSCs homed at a very low level to various tissues (lung, bone marrow, and muscles) and no significant engraftment was found in other organs. TBI induced an increase of engraftment levels of hMSCs in the brain, heart, bone marrow, and muscles. Abdominal irradiation (AI) as compared with leg irradiation (LI) increased hMSC engraftment in the exposed area (the gut, liver, and spleen). Hind LI as compared with AI increased hMSC engraftment in the exposed area (skin, quadriceps, and muscles). An increase of hMSC engraftment in organs outside the fields of the ALI was also observed. Conversely, following LI, hMSC engraftment was increased in the brain as compared with AI. This study shows that engraftment of hMSCs in NOD/SCID mice with significantly increased in response to tissue injuries following TBI with or without ALI. ALI induced an increase of the level of engraftment at sites outside the local irradiation field, thus suggesting a distant (abscopal) effect of radiation damage.

Using microarrays, the patterns of gene expression were established for brain, kidney, liver and spleen samples from the non-exposed offspring of irradiated CBA/Ca and BALB/c male mice. The most over-represented categories among the genes differentially expressed in the offspring of control and irradiated males were those involved in rhythmic process, circadian rhythm and DNA-dependent regulation of transcription.

Six weeks after AVM creation, 32 rats were treated with a single dose of GKS (20 Gy); 32 animals received sham radiation. Eight irradiated and 8 control animals were studied at each specified time point (1, 3, 6, and 12 weeks) for hemodynamic, morphological, and histological characterization. Results Two AVMs showed partial angiographic obliteration at 6 weeks. Angiography revealed complete obliteration in 3 irradiated rats at 12 weeks. Blood flow in the ipsilateral proximal carotid artery (p < 0.001) and arterialized jugular vein (p < 0.05) was significantly lower in the irradiated group than in the control group. The arterialized vein's external diameter was significantly smaller in GKS-treated animals at 6 (p < 0.05) and 12 (p < 0.001) weeks. Histological changes included subendothelial cellular proliferation and luminal narrowing in GKS-treated animals. Neither luminal obliteration nor thrombus formation was identified at any of the time points in either irradiated or nonirradiated animals. Conclusions GKS produced morphological, angiographic, and histological changes in the model of AVM as early as 6 weeks after treatment. These results support the use of this model for studying methods to enhance radiation response in AVMs. Copyright © AANS, 2015.",Excluded,0.9581175
514,"Redox balance- and radiation-mediated alteration in hippocampal neurogenesis Changes in the intracellular and extracellular redox balance have been correlated with cell fate decisions in terms of proliferation versus differentiation, entering versus existing cell cycle and survival versus cell death. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been correlated with neuronal plasticity of learning and memory; however, the process is exquisitely sensitive to changes in redox balance. Cranial irradiation is an effective modality in treating brain tumours but often leads to deficits in hippocampus-related learning and memory, which is most likely due to sustained elevation of oxygen free radical production and suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis. The subcellular redox environment affecting hippocampal neurogenesis is largely unknown. Using mutant mice deficient in each one of the three superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) isoforms, we have begun to determine the consequences of SOD deficiency in hippocampal neurogenesis and the related functions of learning and memory under normal condition and following cranial irradiation.",Excluded,0.956589

Diffusion signal decay within brain white matter was fit to a biexponential model to separate changes within the slow and fast components. Linear mixed-effects models were used to obtain estimates of the effect of radiation dose and time on the model parameters.RESULTS: We found an increase of 0.11 x 10<sup>-4</sup> and 0.14 x 10<sup>-4</sup> mm<sup>2</sup> /s in the fast diffusion coefficient per unit dose-time (Gy-month) in the longitudinal and transverse directions, respectively. By contrast, the longitudinal slow diffusion coefficient decreased independently of dose, by 0.18 x 10<sup>-4</sup> , 0.16 x 10<sup>-4</sup> , and 0.098 x 10<sup>-4</sup> mm<sup>2</sup> /s at 1, 4, and 9 months post-RT, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced white matter changes in the first year following RT are driven by dose-dependent increases in the fast component and dose-independent decreases in the slow component.",Excluded,0.95453876
661,"Preclinical MRI reveals anti-VEGF therapy mitigates radiation necrosis Purpose: Radiation necrosis, a severe but late occurring injury to normal tissue within and surrounding a radiation treatment field, has been described as a slow, continuous process in which increased levels of VEGF-A lead to breakdown of the blood brain barrier [1]. Thus, a strategy that involves blocking VEGF-A from reaching capillaries and repairing ""leaky"" capillaries is a possible therapeutic approach for radiation necrosis. In this work, in concert with a novel mouse model of radiation necrosis [2], the therapeutic effects of the humanized anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech) and the murine anti-VEGF antibody B20-4.1.1 (Genentech) are monitored by magnetic resonance imaging. Method(s): Hemispheric irradiation of mouse brain was performed with the Leksell Gamma Knife PerfexionTM (GK), a state-of-the-art unit used for stereotactic irradiation of patients with malignant brain tumors. Three cohorts of 7-8 week old female mice (n=5) were irradiated with a single 60-Gy dose (50% isodose) of GK radiation. At this dose, the onset of radiation necrosis typically occurs 3-4 weeks post-irradiation. Mouse cohort #1 was an irradiated but untreated control; cohort #2 received bevacizumab (10 mg/kg, twice weekly) from 3-to-10 weeks post-irradiation; cohort #3 received B20- 4.1.1 (10 mg/kg, twice weekly) from 4-to-13 weeks post-irradiation. Mice were imaged from 3-to-10 weeks post-irradiation, using an Agilent/Varian DirectDriveTM 4.7-T small-animal MR scanner. Result(s): The MRI-derived volumes of radiation necrosis for control, bevacizumab-treated, and B20-4.1.1-treated mice are plotted in Fig. 1 as a function of time post-irradiation. Both anti-VEGF antibodies slow the overall rate of progression (p<0.0001, week 10). Considering the initial 3-7 week period postirradiation, bevacizumab has the same mitigative effect as B20-4.1.1 (p = 0.8, week 7). However, for the latter 3-week period (7-10 weeks post-irradiation), radiation-induced necrosis developed at a higher rate than in the B20-4.1.1-treated cohort (p<0.0001, week 10), indicating that the mitigative effect of bevacizumab was weaker than B20-4.1.1 in the late period following the initiation of treatment. Histology results support the MR data. The irradiated hemispheres of the control mice demonstrated many of the classic histologic features of radiation necrosis. In contrast, the irradiated hemisphere of the bevacizumab-treated mouse showed only modest tissue damage and the irradiated hemisphere of the B20-4.1.1-treated mouse displayed no visible tissue damage. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate a significant mitigative effect of bevacizumab and B20-4.1.1 in a mouse model of radiation necrosis, an effect also observed recently in a group of brain-tumor patients treated with bevacizumab [3]. Efforts to verify the mechanism of action of bevacizumab and B20-4.1.1 in the treatment of radiation necrosis in the mouse model are ongoing. (Graph presented).",Excluded,0.953678

1135,"Repair and mutagenesis at oxidized DNA lesions in the developing brain of wild-type and Ogg1-/- mice OGG1 (8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1) is one of the main DNA glycosylases present in mammalian cells. The enzyme removes 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) lesions, believed to be the most important oxidized lesions due to their relatively high incidence and their miscoding properties. This study shows that in prenatal mice brains the repair capacity for 8-oxoG is 5-10-fold higher than in adult mice brains. Western blot analysis and repair activity in extracts from Ogg1(-/-) mice revealed that OGG1 was responsible for the efficient 8-oxoG removal from prenatal mice. To investigate how OGG1 protects against oxidative stress-induced mutagenesis, pregnant Big Blue/wild-type and Big Blue/Ogg1(-/-) mice were exposed to nontoxic doses of gamma radiation. A 2.5-fold increase in the mutation frequency in Ogg1(-/-) mouse brains was obtained by exposure to 3.5 Gy at day 19 postfertilization. This was largely due to GC to TA transversions, believed to originate from 8-oxoG mispairing with A during replication. Furthermore, rapid cell divisions seemed to be required for fixation of mutations, as a similar dose of radiation did not increase the mutation frequency, or the frequency of GC to TA transversion, in the adult brain.",Excluded,0.9507992
562,"Perturbations of cell-cycle progression in gamma-irradiated ataxia telangiectasia and Huntington's disease cells detected by DNA flow cytometric analysis The effects of ionizing radiation on cell-cycle progression in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from ataxia telangiectasia (AT) and Huntington's disease (HD) patients, and from normal individuals, were studied using DNA flow cytometric analysis. A dose of 100 rad gamma irradiation blocked a proportion of normal and HD cells in G1. A higher radiation dose applied to normal cells increased the number of cells blocked in G1 and significantly delayed cells which were in S at the time of irradiation from reaching G2 DNA content. The reduced cumulative mitotic index in irradiated cultures of normal cells 2 h after irradiation suggests that cells in G2 at the time of irradiation are delayed before entering mitosis. After irradiation HD cells responded similarly to normal cells except that a greater proportion of HD cells were blocked in G1. AT cells do not show the normal delay in progression from G1 to S, or from S to G2 in the first cycle after irradiation. The cumulative mitotic index was reduced in irradiated cells, implying that they are delayed in G2. Thus AT cells did not recognize or respond to signals from damaged DNA which in normal and HD cells caused a proportional block in G1 and an S-phase delay. The only point of arrest in cell-cycle progression in irradiated AT cells was in G2.",Excluded,0.95039874
281,"Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated is not required for p53 induction and apoptosis in irradiated epithelial tissues The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (Atm) protein kinase is a central regulator of the cellular response to DNA damage. Although Atm can regulate p53, it is not known if this Atm function varies between tissues. Previous studies showed that the induction of p53 and apoptosis by whole-body ionizing radiation varies greatly between tissue and tumor types, so here we asked if Atm also had a tissue-specific role in the ionizing radiation response. Irradiated Atm-null mice showed impaired p53 induction and apoptosis in thymus, spleen, and brain. In contrast, radiation-induced p53, apoptosis, phosphorylation of Chk2, and G(2)-M cell cycle arrest were slightly delayed in Atm(-/-) epithelial cells of the small intestine but reached wild-type levels by 4 h. Radiation-induced p53 and apoptosis in Atm(-/-) hair follicle epithelial cells were not impaired at any of the time points examined. Thus, Atm is essential for radiation-induced apoptosis in lymphoid tissues but is largely dispensable in epithelial cells. This indicates that marked differences in DNA damage signaling pathways exist between tissues, which could explain some of the tissue-specific phenotypes, especially tumor suppression, associated with Atm deficiency.",Excluded,0.94875306
1013,"Higher seizure susceptibility in rats with cortical dysplasia: A feedback systems perspective Rationale: Cortical dysplasia (CD) is one of the leading causes of drug resistant focal epilepsy. Despite significant advances in various diagnostic and therapeutic methods, the basic mechanisms of higher susceptibility for seizures in patients with CD remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to develop a mathematical framework using principles from second order system dynamics to further characterize the effect of a ""second hit"" [acute single pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure] in animal model of in utero radiation-induced CD as compared to a PTZ induced seizure in normal control rat. Method(s): CD was induced through in utero irradiation of 4 pregnant Sprague Dawley rats at E17 with 145 cGy. Fourteen litters (XRT) were implanted with intracortical depth electrodes targeting the right and left frontal and parietal cortex. A set of 27 aged matched normal rats served as controls. All rats were injected with PTZ at 40 mg/kg. Post PTZ injection, all 14 XRT rats developed seizures (Group 1), 17 out of 27 normal rats developed seizures (Group 2) and in 10 normal rats, PTZ injection failed to induce seizures (Group 3). The flow diagram of experimental steps involved is provided in Fig. 1A. To characterize the response of the abnormal/normal brain to PTZ, the average gamma coherence (Cr) across all pairs of electrode and across all rats within a group was computed for the entire duration of recording (24 hours). The Cr profile can be viewed as the impulse response of an over-damped 2nd order system (See Fig.1C), the impulse function being the PTZ injection. The system parameters can then be estimated by fitting Eq.1 to Cr. Result(s): Fig. 1B shows Cr profile and the fitted data for the 3 groups of rats. Table 1, shows the location of poles s1, s2, the under-damped natural frequency (omegan) and the damping ratio of the system (xi). The slow pole s1 represents the long-term effects of the PTZ injection whereas the fast pole s2 dictates the immediate reaction of the system to external perturbation. Note that the slow pole is similar across the 3 groups (Fig. 1D). The location of the pole represents the stability of the system. The location of fast pole is closest to the imaginary axes for XRT rats and hence is suggestive of a less stable system. The lowest damping ratio is for the XRT rat, followed by rats in Group 2 and Group 3. A high damping ratio indicates that the system is resistive to oscillations caused by external perturbations. Conclusion(s): Our study shows that there exists an internal feedback mechanism within the brain of normal rats which reduces its susceptibility to epileptogenesis. We hypothesize that this feedback control mechanism is dysfunctional within the dysplastic (CD) rat brain. Support for this claim is provided by the relatively lower damping ratio and location of the fast pole of the CD rats (p<0.01). Translation of this concept to human studies using neurostimulation paradigms may provide a novel methodology to characterize and measure epileptogenicity in abnormal/normal tissues. Our future work will be targeted along these lines. (Figure Presented).",Excluded,0.9470485

To evaluate each model, rats (n = 12) with C6 gliomas were imaged with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast-enhanced MRI at 7 time points over 2 weeks. Rats received either 20 or 40 Gy between the third and fourth imaging time point. Diffusion-weighted MRI was used to estimate tumor cell number within enhancing regions in contrast-enhanced MRI data. Each model was fit to the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor cell number from time point 1 to time point 5 to estimate model parameters. The estimated model parameters were then used to predict tumor growth at the final 2 imaging time points. The model prediction was evaluated by calculating the error in tumor volume estimates, average surface distance, and voxel-based cell number.RESULTS: For both the rats treated with either 20 or 40 Gy, significantly lower error in tumor volume, average surface distance, and voxel-based cell number was observed for the M<sub>dp</sub> and M<sub>p</sub> models compared with the M<sub>d</sub> model. The M<sub>dp</sub> model fit, however, had significantly lower sum squared error compared with the M<sub>p</sub> and M<sub>d</sub> models.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that for both doses, the M<sub>p</sub> and M<sub>dp</sub> models result in accurate predictions of tumor growth, whereas the M<sub>d</sub> model poorly describes response to radiation therapy.",Excluded,0.9406074

Background: Immune-modulatory proteins HLA-G and HLA-E were originally thought to be restricted to the protection of the fetus from maternal allorecognition. Now they are known for multiple immune-regulatory functions. We already described production of immune-modulatory molecules HLA-G and HLA-E by both microglial cells (Kren, L. et al., J Neuroimmunol 2010) and neoplastic cells (Kren, L. et al. Neuropathology 2011). We described the unexpected positive correlation of HLA-E expression by neoplastic cells in glioblastoma (GB) with the length of survival, which we hypothetized could be attributable to subsequent therapeutic modalities. Therefore, we decided to analyse the expression of HLA-G and HLA-E in three GB cell lines before and after the impact of ionizing radiation. Design(s): We used three GB cell lines: T 98G, A172 and U 87MG. The expression of HLA-G and HLA-E was assessed before application of ionizing radiation (0-2-5-10-15- 20 Gy) and then was analysed again 24h and 72 h after radiation. HLA-G and HLA-E antigens were analysed flow-cytometrically. Result(s): The expression of both HLA-G and HLA-E by all three cell lines of GB was elevated significantly after irradiation, expecially expression of HLA-E in the line T 98G. (Graph Presented) Conclusion(s): We revealed that expression of HLA-G and HLA-E in GB cell lines alters significantly after the impact of ionizing radiation. This finding may represent a new, unrecognized pathway of the effect of ionizing radiation in cancer therapy. In GB, namely, HLA-E may function, in its elevated levels, as a ligand for activating receptor CD94/NKG2C, therefore mediating increased lysis of tumor cells.",Excluded,0.93534946
1179,"Increased risk of ischemic stroke in young nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients PURPOSE: Radiation/chemoradiotherapy-induced carotid stenosis and cerebrovascular events in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) can cause severe disability and even death. This study aimed to estimate the risk of ischemic stroke in this patient population over more than 10 years of follow-up.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study cohorts consisted of all patients hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of NPC (n=1094), whereas patients hospitalized for an appendectomy during 1997 and 1998 (n=4376) acted as the control group and surrogate for the general population. Cox proportional hazard model was performed as a means of comparing the stroke-free survival rate between the two cohorts after adjusting for possible confounding and risk factors.RESULTS: Of the 292 patients with ischemic strokes, 62 (5.7%) were from the NPC cohort and 230 (5.3%) were from the control group. NPC patients ages 35-54 had a 1.66 times (95% CI, 1.16-2.86; p=0.009) higher risk of ischemic stroke after adjusting for patient characteristics, comorbidities, geographic region, urbanization level of residence, and socioeconomic status. There was no statistical difference in ischemic stroke risk between the NPC patients and appendectomy patients ages 55-64 years (hazard ratio=0.87; 95% CI, 0.56-1.33; p=0.524) after adjusting for other factors.CONCLUSIONS: Young NPC patients carry a higher risk for ischemic stroke than the general population. Besides regular examinations of carotid duplex, different irradiation strategies or using new technique of radiotherapy, such as intensity modulated radiation therapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy, should be considered in young NPC patients.",Excluded,0.93390447

Most recently, cell culture and animal studies provided the first convincing evidence that radiation not only eliminates tumor cells, but also modulates the immune response and likely improves anti-tumor immunotherapy.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present an in vivo study that analyzes the effects of radiation on the immune response in tumor patients. As readout system, we utilized the reactivity of glioma patients' sera against antigen GLEA2 as the most frequent antigen immunogenic in glioblastoma patients. We established an ELISA assay to analyze reactivity of 24 glioblastoma patients over a period of several months. As control we used 30 sera from healthy donors as well as 30 sera from lung cancer patients. We compared the course of GLEA2 seroreactivity at different times prior, during and after radiation. The GLEA2 seroreactivity was increased by the time of surgery, decreased after surgery, increased again under radiation, and slightly decreased after radiation.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide in vivo evidence for an increased antibody response against tumor antigens under radiation.

Also antiproliferative effects have been reported against glioblastoma cell lines. DESIGN/METHODS: LAZ PEGylated liposomes (Lipo G) were developed at the University of Houston.. Glioblastoma cell line U87-expressing firefly luciferase reporter gene (100,000 cells in 2 mL) was injected intracranially in each SCID mouse. There were 4 treatment groups (n = 8-9, each): brain model (M) without treatment (control), radiation 2Gy weekly (M + R), LipoGat 5 mug/kg dose intraperitoneally twice per week (M + L) and radiation with LipoG(M + R + L). Treatment lasted three weeks. Tumor size was monitored using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), in each mouse. Mice were sacrificed after 3 weeks. Brain was harvested. Lipid peroxidation of brain tissues was quantified by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) as a surrogate biomarker. Survival was evaluated using Kaplan Meier analysis at P= 0.05. RESULT(S): BLI intensity was 4002.03+/-1737.67, 2034+/-737.72, 1387.36+/-684.53 and 2498.89+/-2521.32 % for M, M + R, M+ L and M + R + L, respectively. Tumor size of the M+ L group was reduced by 65% compared to control. There was no significant difference in tumor size of radiated groups compared to control group.MDAbrain concentration inM+ L andM+ R + L groups was significantly less than in M+ R group (8.27+/-0.78 and 10.37+/- 3.30 muM/gm vs. 23.09+/- 3.79 muM/gm).

In addition, two different forms of ionizing radiation (gamma-rays and protons) were utilized. Body and spleen mass, leukocyte blastogenesis, and flow cytometry analysis of cell populations in blood and spleen were performed to detect toxicity, if any, and to identify mechanisms that may correlate with the anti-tumor action of combination therapy. C6 tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously into athymic mice and allowed to become established before treatment initiation. pGL1-TNF-alpha was injected into the implanted tumors, which were then irradiated 16-18 hr later; each modality was administered three times over 8-9 days. The addition of pGL1-TNF-alpha significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of radiation (p < 0.05). The effect was more than additive, since pGL1-TNF-alpha alone did not slow tumor progression and radiation alone had only a modest effect. Administration of pGL1-TNF-alpha together with proton radiation resulted in tumor volumes that were 23% smaller than those following pGL1-TNF-alpha + gamma-ray treatment; a similar differential in tumor size was observed in the groups receiving only radiation. Body weights and blood and spleen cell analyses did not reveal treatment-related toxicity. High basal proliferation of blood leukocytes and increased B cell levels in the spleen were associated with pGL1-TNF-alpha + 60Co (gamma-radiation) or proton treatment. Overall, the results suggest that the pGL1-TNF-alpha/radiation combination is effective and safe under the conditions employed. This is the first study to combine gene and proton radiation therapy and to show, under controlled experimental conditions, that proton radiation may have a greater effect against malignant tumors compared to the same physical dose of gamma-radiation.",Excluded,0.9204119
647,"Irradiation induces glioblastoma cell senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and fatal primary brain tumors in humans. The standard therapy for the treatment of GBM is surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. However, the frequency of tumor recurrence in GBM patients is very high, and the survival rate remains poor. Delineating the mechanisms of GBM recurrence is essential for therapeutic advances. Here, we demonstrate that irradiation rendered 17-20 % of GBM cells dead, but resulted in 60-80 % of GBM cells growth-arrested with increases in senescence markers, such as senescence-associated beta-galactosidase-positive cells, H3K9me3-positive cells, and p53-p21(CIP1)-positive cells. Moreover, irradiation induced expression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) mRNAs and NFkappaB transcriptional activity in GBM cells. Strikingly, compared to injection of non-irradiated GBM cells into immune-deficient mice, the co-injection of irradiated and non-irradiated GBM cells resulted in faster growth of tumors with the histological features of human GBM. Taken together, our findings suggest that the increases in senescent cells and SASP in GBM cells after irradiation is likely one of main reasons for tumor recurrence in post-radiotherapy GBM patients.",Excluded,0.91762054

570,"Re-evaluation of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited-stage small cell lung cancer: a propensity score matched analysis We attempted to re-evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) with more recent data. A total of 179 patients with LS-SCLC received radical thoracic radiotherapy and chemotherapy at our institution between 1998 and 2018. One hundred twenty-eight patients who achieved complete response (CR), good partial response (PR), and PR without progression for at least for one year after initial therapy were enrolled in this study. These patients were divided into a PCI group (group A, n=43), and a non-PCI group (group B, n=85). Survival outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. Because several background factors differed significantly between groups A and B, propensity score (PS) matching was performed as 1:1 match of the two groups. Finally, we analyzed 64 patients (group A/B=32/32). Median follow-up periods were 53 and 31 months in groups A and B, respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups' backgrounds. Two-year overall survival (OS) rates were 77% in group A and 62% in group B (p=0.224). Two-year brain metastasis free survival (BMFS) rates were 85% in group A and 57% in group B (p=0.008). The number of patients who underwent a brain imaging test for confirmation of no brain metastasis (BM) after radical thoracic radiotherapy and chemotherapy (before PCI) was 84 (group A/B=32/52). A PS matched analysis for cases of pre-PCI brain imaging group, two-year OS rates for group A/B were 73/59% (p=0.446). Two-year BMFS rates for group A/B were 91/52% (p=0.021).

945,"Does prophylactic cranial irradiation improve overall survival of elderly patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer? Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has led to improved overall survival (OS) for patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that has responded completely to chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy. However, whether PCI is indicated for elderly patients remains unclear. Method(s): We reviewed 658 patients with limited-stage SCLC treated in 1986-2009 at a single institution with definitive concurrent chemoradiation to a total radiation dose of 45-70 Gy. Variables investigated for possible association with OS included patient sex, age, ethnicity, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score, year of diagnosis and treatment period (1986-1999 vs. 2000-2009), tumor size, radiation dose, cycles of induction chemotherapy, use of intensity-modulated-radiation-therapy (IMRT), and fractionation. Groups were compared with chi-square tests for categorical variables or medians tests for continuous variables. Kaplan-Meier estimates were constructed for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local-recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Result(s): Among 658 patients, 507 patients were <70 years old (Group A) and 151 patients were >=70 years old (Group B). Median survival time was significantly longer in the younger group (25.6 months vs. 20.3 months, P=0.007), but no differences were found in DFS, LRFS, or DMFS time by age. Of the 151 patients aged >=70 years (54 of whom received PCI and 89 did not), those treated in 2000-2009 (vs. 1986-1999) had better brain MFS than those treated in 1986-1999 (P=0.048); those who received PCI had better brain MFS than those who did not (P=0.033). Multivariate analysis showed that among patients aged >=70, receiving PCI, not receiving induction chemotherapy, and local-regional control were associated with fewer brain metastases (for PCI, subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR]=0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.95, P=0.037; for induction chemotherapy, SHR=0.43, 95% CI=0.19-0.96, P=0.039; and for local-regional failure, SHR=0.996, 95% CI=0.993- 0.998, P=0.001). Among patients >=70, receipt of PCI seemed to have been associated with better OS for those with small-volume disease (primary+nodal disease <5 cm, P=0.0545) but not for those with larger-volume disease (P=0.7387). Conclusion(s): Patients aged >=70 years with small-volume limited-stage SCLC seemed to show a benefit in OS from the use of PCI, but those with larger-volume disease did not. Improved brain MFS was associated with use of PCI, no induction chemotherapy, and locoregional control.",Excluded,0.9132432

1075,"Combination of hypomorphic mutations of the Drosophila homologues of aryl hydrocarbon receptor and nucleosome assembly protein family genes disrupts morphogenesis, memory and detoxification Aryl hydrocarbon receptor is essential for biological responses to endogenous and exogenous toxins in mammals. Its Drosophila homolog spineless plays an important role in fly morphogenesis. We have previously shown that during morphogenesis spineless genetically interacts with CG5017 gene, which encodes a nucleosome assembly factor and may affect cognitive function of the fly. We now demonstrate synergistic interactions of spineless and CG5017 in pathways controlling oxidative stress response and long-term memory formation in Drosophila melanogaster. Oxidative stress was induced by low doses of X-ray irradiation of flies carrying hypomorphic mutation of spineless, mutation of CG5017, and their combination. To determine the sensitivity of these mutants to pharmacological modifiers of the irradiation effect, we irradiated flies growing on standard medium supplemented by radiosensitizer furazidin and radioprotector serotonin. The effects of irradiation were investigated by analyzing leg and antenna morphological structures and by using real-time PCR to measure mRNA expression levels for spineless, Cyp6g1 and Gst-theta genes. We also examined long-term memory in these mutants using conditioned courtship suppression paradigm. Our results show that the interaction of spineless and CG5017 is important for regulation of morphogenesis, long-term memory formation, and detoxification during oxidative stress. Since spineless and CG5017 are evolutionary conserved, these results must be considered when evaluating the risk of combining similar mutations in other organisms, including humans.",Excluded,0.91198194
287,"Use of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay to measure radiation-induced chromosome damage in lymphoblastoid cell lines To establish the optimal experimental conditions for the use of the micronuclei (MN) test to determine the level of chromosomal damage induced by ionising radiation (IR) exposure in lymphoblastoid cell lines, a time-course study was performed comparing a normal and an ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cell line, the latter being characterised by an extreme radiation sensitivity. Several parameters were analysed: the use of cytochalasin-B (Cyt-B) to quantify MN, the optimum fixation time to measure radiation-induced MN, the most appropriate treatment dose of IR to distinguish between the normal and the radiosensitive cells and the cell-cycle distribution after irradiation. The results obtained showed that the spontaneous as well as the radiation-induced levels of MN were significantly higher in the AT cell compared to the normal cells (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). In both cell types the number of radiation-induced MN were lower in the cultures without Cyt-B than those with Cyt-B (P < 0.001), with the AT cells being distinguished in terms of IR-induced MN from the normal cells only with the addition of Cyt-B. The level of MN formation was independent of the dose of Cyt-B used (3 or 6 microg/ml). The optimum time for radiation-induced MN measured was found to be between 48 and 72 h post-irradiation, with 2 and 4 Gy exposures inducing similar levels of MN. However, as the higher dose caused a greater delay in the cell-cycle, treatment with 2 Gy with MN measurement at 48 h in the presence of 3 microg/ml Cyt-B were chosen as the optimum experimental conditions. This choice was validated using two additional normal and AT cell lines. In conclusion, our results show that the use of Cyt-B increases the sensitivity of the MN test for comparing differences in radiosensitivity between lymphoblastoid cell lines.",Excluded,0.9103147
331,"Skin fibroblast cell lines derived from non-Hodgkin's-lymphoma (NHL) patients show increased sensitivity to chronic gamma irradiation Cultured fibroblast cells from 19 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 3 patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT), 3 AT heterozygotes and 11 (presumed) normal subjects were studied for impaired colony-forming ability after chronic gamma irradiation. Five cell lines from the NHL patients were also examined for the sensitivity to acute gamma irradiation, as compared with those of normal subjects. To ascertain the degree of radiosensitivity of different cell lines, a comparison was made of the D10 values (radiation dose resulting in 10% survival) for each cell line, estimated ""by eye"" from the actual survival curves, and also from the calculated curves fitted to a log-linear model. It was observed that the acute gamma irradiation failed to show any appreciable difference in the radiation response of the cell lines from NHL patients as compared with those of normal subjects. However, chronic irradiation demonstrated significantly increased radiosensitivity in at least 10-12 NHL patients with a p value of less than 0.05, when the D10 values of each patient's cell line were compared with the calculated composite values for the normals. When the D10 values of the NHL patients and the normal subjects were compared as 2 groups, the former appeared to be significantly more sensitive to chronic gamma irradiation (p less than 0.0001). The same level of significant difference in radiosensitivity was found between the 2 groups when their D37 values (radiation dose resulting in 37% survival) were compared. In general, the radiation response of the NHL patients was similar to that of the AT homozygotes and heterozygotes used as a positive control group. Our data thus show that increased radiosensitivity is associated with the NHL patients studied, indicating an underlying abnormality of their DNA repair.",Excluded,0.90638876
219,"Sensori-neural hearing loss in patients treated with irradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma The present investigation has been carried out to evaluate the sensitivity of the inner ear to irradiation. Cochlear function was tested in a cohort of 22 patients before and 7-84 months after receiving external irradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The pre-irradiation sensori-neural hearing threshold at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz was used as a baseline for the individual patient, and the observed sensori-neural hearing loss (SNHL) was calculated as the difference between pre- and post-irradiation values. The pre-irradiation hearing level or patient age was not correlated with the actual SNHL. In contrast, there was a significant correlation between the total radiation dose to the inner ear and the observed hearing impairment. SNHL was most pronounced in the high frequencies, with values up to 35 dB (4000 Hz) and 25 dB (2000 Hz) in some patients. The latent period for the complication appeared to be 12 months or more.

960,"[Molecular and cellular mechanisms of late radiation injuries] Late radiation damages arise more often in nonproliferating or slow proliferating tissues after local irradiation in large (intolerable) doses of ionizing radiation. Obviously the late radiation effects are induced by radiation damages to capillaries and disturbances of microcirculation in tissues. This is a basis for tissue hypoxia, ""oxidative stress"" and loss of parenchyma cells. The direct radiation effect on parenchyma cells has as a rule little importance for production of late radiation damages. Other type of late radiation damages can be discovered after sublethal irradiation of whole body. This is a cause of decrease of life span. In this case the important factors are also damages of vessels, disturbances in microcirculation and loss of parenchyma cells in ""target"" organs especially in neuroendocrine and immune systems. The new data on the possibility to decrease the late radiation damages after local or whole body irradiation using postradiation treatment with pulsed electric field (PEF) are considered. Mechanisms of PEF effects are explained in terms of its ability to induce nitric oxide production which causes intensification of blood microcirculation, as well as increase in SOD production and activity of repair enzymes.

We used fluorinated polyimide because of its biocompatibility and excellent thermal and mechanical properties for ion irradiation. Rattus norvegicus chromaffin (PC12) cells were used for in vitro studies. The polyimide films were irradiated with He(+), Ne(+), or Kr(+) ions in a fluence range from 10(13) to 10(15) ions/cm(2) at 50 keV. PC12 cells selectively adhered to the polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation. The total neurite length for PC12 cells grown on the Kr(+)-irradiated film was the longest; the neurite length on the film irradiated by Kr(+) after 9 days was approximately five times longer than that for cells grown on the He(+)-irradiated film, i.e., 135 micro m. In addition, the PC12 differentiation rate on the ion-irradiated polyimide films also showed a similar trend to the total neurite length for PC12 cells cultured on the films: the rate decreased in the order Kr(+) > Ne(+) > He(+). This initial study indicated enhanced neurite outgrowth and differentiation of PC12 cells on fluorinated polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation.",Excluded,0.8926465
175,"Electron beam irradiation as protection against the environmental release of recombinant molecules for biomaterials applications In biomaterials applications there exists a need to protect against the environmental release of recombinant microorganisms and transmissible genetic material and to prevent the recovery of proprietary genetic information. Irradiation technologies have long been used to eliminate microorganisms associated with spoilage and contamination and recent studies have demonstrated that moderate doses of irradiation may be used to sterilize medically important proteins without causing adverse effects in their desirable biological properties. Recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing organophosphate hydrolase (OPH, E.C. 3.1.8.1), an important enzyme for the detection and decontamination of neurotoxic pesticides and chemical warfare agents, were subjected to electron beam irradiation to gauge its effect on enzymatic activity, cell viability and DNA recoverability. Bacterial samples were irradiated at 2, 20 and 200 kGy using a 10 MeV electron source. Irradiation levels of 2 to 20 kGy were sufficient to eliminate viable cells without affecting OPH enzymatic activity. Biologically active DNA was recovered via PCR from all samples through the 20 kGy irradiation level. While DNA was not recovered from samples at the 200 kGy exposure level, protein activity was reduced by 19 to 78%, depending on the method of cell preparation. These results demonstrate that irradiation can be effective in preventing the release of recombinant organisms intended for use in biomaterials applications without eliminating enzymatic activity and suggests that further research may indicate specific conditions whereby DNA recovery can be eliminated while retaining sufficient enzymatic activity for targeted biomaterials applications.",Excluded,0.89187205
142,"Influence of surface pattern and sterilisation of solvent-cast films for peripheral nerve guidance INTRODUCTION : Damage to peripheral nerves can result in considerable morbidity and loss of function. Poly-(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and PCL/poly-(D,L-lactic acid) (PLA) blend nerve guidance conduits are a promising alternative to autologous nerve grafts in the treatment of peripheral nerve injury1. The surface morphology of scaffolds is known to influence their physical properties and cell behaviour. Yet, as scaffolds progress further towards clinical trials, it is imperative that they are subjected to/and capable of withstanding approved sterilisation methods, such as gamma irradiation, without causing detrimental effects to the material physical properties and/or cell response. This study investigates how surface patterns affect PCL films and aims to assess whether PCL/PLA blend scaffolds are able to withstand gamma irradiation sufficient for medical sterilisation. METHOD(S): PCL and PCL/PLA (4:1 w/w) blend solutions were prepared using dichloromethane (3% w/v). Smooth, pitted and micro-grooved PCL films were cast and imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while tensile testing was used to quantify their mechanical properties (Instron 1122, load cell 0.010 kN). NG108-15 cells were cultured up to 14 days on the various PCL film surfaces before fluorescence and SEM imaging were performed both to confirm biocompatibility and observe cell behaviour. PCL/PLA blend films will be sterilised at 7 incremental doses of gamma radiation (15-45 kGy) (Isotron). Mechanical testing, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography will be utilised to evaluate any changes in material properties or structure in comparison to unirradiated control samples. RESULT(S): The mean thickness of all types of solvent-cast film was less than 100 mum. The average porosity of the pitted PCL films was 53% with 2.1+/-0.5 mum diameter pits. Smooth films were significantly stronger, with greater modulus and strain (Table 1*p<0.01). NG108-15 cells attached and proliferated on the PCL films in vitro up to 14 days. However, only on the grooved samples did cells display organisation, demonstrating alignment in the same orientation as the grooves (Fig. 1). (Table presented) Discussion & CONCLUSION(S): These findings support the use of solvent cast PCL films for fabricating nerve guides. Pits in the surface of the inner lumen are beneficial in cell growth and grooved surfaces enable the alignment of neurons. In this work all patterned surfaces had sufficient tensile strength to function as nerve conduits. PCL/PLA blended films were tested to see whether they would withstand medical-grade sterilisation. It is hypothesised that the polymer films will not be significantly affected by gamma irradiation.",Excluded,0.8891727
388,"Antiphosphatidylserine antibody combined with irradiation damages tumor blood vessels and induces tumor immunity in a rat model of glioblastoma PURPOSE: The vascular targeting antibody bavituximab is being combined with chemotherapy in clinical trials in cancer patients. Bavituximab targets the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylserine, complexed with beta2-glycoprotein I. Phosphatidylserine is normally intracellular but becomes exposed on the luminal surface of vascular endothelium in tumors. Phosphatidylserine exposure on tumor vessels is increased by chemotherapy and irradiation. Here, we determined whether treatment with the murine equivalent of bavituximab, 2aG4, combined with irradiation can suppress tumor growth in a rat model of glioblastoma.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: F98 glioma cells were injected into the brains of syngeneic rats where they grow initially as a solid tumor and then infiltrate throughout the brain. Rats with established tumors were treated with 10 Gy whole brain irradiation and 2aG4.RESULTS: Combination treatment doubled the median survival time of the rats, and 13% of animals were rendered disease free. Neither treatment given individually was as effective. We identified two mechanisms. First, irradiation induced phosphatidylserine exposure on tumor blood vessels and enhanced antibody-mediated destruction of tumor vasculature by monocytes/macrophages. Second, the antibody treatment induced immunity to F98 tumor cells, which are normally weakly immunogenic. Surviving rats were immune to rechallenge with F98 tumor cells. In vitro, 2aG4 enhanced the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to generate F98-specific cytotoxic T cells. Phosphatidylserine exposure, which is induced on tumor cells by irradiation, likely suppresses tumor antigen presentation, and 2aG4 blocks this tolerogenic effect.CONCLUSION: Bavituximab combined with radiotherapy holds promise as a vascular targeting and immune enhancement strategy for the treatment of human glioblastoma.",Excluded,0.8885281

A well-characterized, orthotopic rodent model of radiation-induced brain necrosis including a tumor is not currently available The objective of the study was to create focal radiation necrosis in rat brain bearing human glioblastoma (GBM) using stereotactic radiosurgery and confirm it by immuno-histological analysis. Nude rats implanted with primary GBM cells were irradiated using a stereotactic setup (n = 3) or received no radiation (n = 3). Ten weeks after the implantation, growth of the tumor was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For each animal, MRI and contrast-enhanced CT images were obtained and fused using registration software. The tumor was identified and delineated using the fused CT/MR images. A treatment plan was generated using a 4 mm radiosurgery cone such that one portion of the tumor receives 100% dose of 60 Gy sufficient to cause necrosis, whereas the tumor edge at depth receives only 50% or less dose, allowing for regrowth of the tumor. The brains were collected 10 weeks after irradiation and immuno-histological analysis was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed central liquefaction necrosis in the high dose region consistent with necrosis and viable tumor in the peripheral low dose region. Ki-67 staining showed highly proliferative tumor cells surrounding the necrotic parts of the tumor. Luxol fast blue and lectin staining showed demyelination and vascular injury in brain tissue consistent with radiation necrosis.

[Polish] Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is currently widely used in the treatment of patients with lung cancer, but despite that the data on alopecia after this type of treatment are limited. Aim. The aim of the study was to identify factors influencing the duration of alopecia after prophylactic cranial irradiation. Material and methods. Two groups of patients were analyzed: group I - 34 patients radically treated fornon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and group II - 18 patients undergoing concurrent chemo-radiotherapy for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In group I 12 patients were treated with radiotherapy only, the remaining patients were treated with neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin + vinorelbin: PN or cisplatin + gemcitabin: PG) in 2 to 6 cycles. PCI was administered during the last tree weeks of thoracic irradiation or >=2 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy and consisted of 15 fractions of 2 Gy per day (30 Gy), 5 days per week. Patients from group II received 25 Gy in 10 fractions starting from the second week of thoracic irradiation; chemotherapy (cisplatin + vepesid: PE every 21 days) started concurrently with thoracic irradiation. Results. Alopecia occurred in all patients treated with PCI; hair loss began 2-3 weeks after the initiation of therapy. In group I full re-growth of hair occurred in 33 patients, one patient died during treatment, before hair re-growth had the chance to take place. Time to re-growth (TRG) was 1.5-6 months, median 2.5 months. In this group we observed a trend towards longer re-growths in patients who had received more than 3 cycles of chemotherapy (p=0.07). In group II hair re-growths occurred between 5 and 12 months after the completion of treatment, with median time of 10 months, and was significantly longer than in group I. Conclusion.

Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning and neuropsychological testing were performed before RT and 3 weeks and 6 months after treatment. Analyses were performed for correlations between changes in 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG)-PET (metabolism), (15)O-PET (relative blood flow), regional radiation dose, follow-up time, and neuropsychological test scores.RESULTS: Eleven subjects were enrolled and 6 completed follow-up studies. The PET data showed reduced FDG uptake, with average decreases of 2-6% in regions of the brain receiving greater than 40 Gy at 3 weeks' and 6 months' follow-up. The (15)O-H(2)O PET showed increases (<10%) at 3 weeks in relative regional blood flow in brain receiving greater than 30 Gy, but less at the 6-month follow-up studies. There were significant correlations between decreases in FDG uptake and increased scores from the Symptom Checklist-90-R, with an average increase in T score of 2 (p < 0.0001). The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test showed a significant correlation of decreased FDG uptake with increased errors and perseveration in test performance, with an average decrease in T score of 11 (p = 0.037).CONCLUSIONS: A dose-dependent response of CNS tissue was detected using FDG PET in this small number of patients. Decreases in CNS metabolism correlated with decreased performance on neuropsychological tests for problem solving, cognitive flexibility, and global measures of psychopathology.

We used a non-dedicated set of resources to calculate detailed dose distributions, including doses to peripheral organs well outside of the primary field, in common rat exposure settings.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a detailed dose reconstruction in a rat through an analog to the conventional human treatment planning process. The process consisted of: (i) Characterizing source properties of an X-ray irradiator system, (ii) acquiring a computed tomography (CT) scan of a rat model, and (iii) using a Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation engine to generate the dose distribution within the rat model. We considered cranial and liver irradiation scenarios where the rest of the body was protected by a lead shield. Organs of interest were the brain, liver and gonads. The study also included paired scenarios where the dose to adjacent, shielded rats was determined as a potential control for analysis of bystander effects.RESULTS: We established the precise doses and dose distributions delivered to the peripheral organs in single and paired rats. Mean doses to non-targeted organs in irradiated rats ranged from 0.03-0.1% of the reference platform dose. Mean doses to the adjacent rat peripheral organs were consistent to within 10% those of the directly irradiated rat.CONCLUSIONS: This work provided details of dose distributions in rat models under common irradiation conditions and established an effective scenario for delivering only scattered radiation consistent with that in a directly irradiated rat.",Excluded,0.81553656

Thus, TGFbeta activation in response to radiation therapy is potentially targetable because it opposes therapeutic control. Strategies to assess this potential in the clinic are needed. Methods and Materials: We evaluated positron emission tomography (PET) to image <sup>89</sup>Zr -fresolimumab, a humanized TGFbeta neutralizing monoclonal antibody, as a means to detect TGFbeta activation in intracranial tumor models. Pathway activity of TGFbeta was validated by immunodetection of phosphorylated SMAD2 and the TGFbeta target, tenascin. The contribution of TGFbeta to radiation response was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of mice bearing intracranial murine tumor models GL261 and SB28 glioblastoma and brain-adapted 4T1 breast cancer (4T1-BrA) treated with TGFbeta neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 1D11, and/or focal radiation (10 Gy). Result(s): <sup>89</sup>Zr-fresolimumab PET imaging detected engineered, physiological, and radiation-induced TGFbeta activation, which was confirmed by immunostaining of biological markers. GL261 glioblastoma tumors had a greater PET signal compared with similar-sized SB28 glioblastoma tumors, whereas the widespread PET signal of 4T1-BrA intracranial tumors was consistent with their highly dispersed histologic distribution. Survival of mice bearing intracranial tumors treated with 1D11 neutralizing antibody alone was similar to that of mice treated with control antibody, whereas 1D11 improved survival when given in combination with focal radiation. The extent of survival benefit of a combination of radiation and 1D11 was associated with the degree of TGFbeta activity detected by PET. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that <sup>89</sup>Zr-fresolimumab PET imaging detects radiation-induced TGFbeta activation in tumors. Functional imaging indicated a range of TGFbeta activity in intracranial tumors, but TGFbeta blockade provided survival benefit only in the context of radiation treatment. This study provides further evidence that radiation-induced TGFbeta activity opposes therapeutic response to radiation. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.81096065

Methods and Materials: In reviewing our experience with PCI as part of a complex protocol for advanced breast cancer, we present descriptive data on late central nervous system outcomes in those receiving PCI. After high-dose anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy, Stage IIIB/IV breast cancer responders underwent tandem autologous marrow transplantation. Those in continued remission were referred for PCI. Whole-brain radiotherapy was delivered by usual means, at 36 Gy in 20 fractions. Result(s): Twenty-four women, with median age 45 (28-61), were enrolled between 1995 and 1998. Disease was largely metastatic (79%), and 75% were previously exposed to chemotherapy or hormonotherapy. Ten patients received PCI, at a median of 13.4 (11.8-16.5) months from study entry. Six patients developed brain metastases, 2 despite PCI. Striking functional decline was documented in 3 patients (at 9 months, 4 years, and 5 years post-PCI), including one previously high-functioning woman requiring full care for posttreatment dementia. Conclusion(s): We present a series of advanced breast cancer patients treated prophylactically with whole-brain radiotherapy following an aggressive chemotherapy regimen. Although the therapeutic benefit of PCI is not ascertainable here, we describe brain metastases occurring despite PCI and serious long-term neurobehavioral sequelae in PCI-treated patients. Any further investigation of PCI in high-risk breast cancer will need to be approached with caution. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.8091115

296,"AT cells are not radiosensitive for simple chromosomal exchanges at low dose Cells deficient in ATM (product of the gene that is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia patients) or NBS (product of the gene mutated in the Nijmegen breakage syndrome) show increased yields of both simple and complex chromosomal aberrations after high doses (>0.5Gy) of ionizing radiation (X-rays or gamma-rays), however less is known on how these cells respond at low dose. Previously we had shown that the increased chromosome aberrations in ATM and NBS defective lines was due to a significantly larger quadratic dose-response term compared to normal fibroblasts for both simple and complex exchanges. The linear dose-response term for simple exchanges was significantly higher in NBS cells compared to wild type cells, but not for AT cells. However, AT cells have a high background level of exchanges compared to wild type or NBS cells that confounds the understanding of low dose responses. To understand the sensitivity differences for high to low doses, chromosomal aberration analysis was first performed at low dose-rates (0.5Gy/d), and results provided further evidence for the lack of sensitivity for exchanges in AT cells below doses of 1Gy. Normal lung fibroblast cells treated with KU-55933, a specific ATM kinase inhibitor, showed increased numbers of exchanges at a dose of 1Gy and higher, but were similar to wild type cells at 0.5Gy or below. These results were confirmed using siRNA knockdown of ATM. The present study provides evidence that the increased radiation sensitivity of AT cells for chromosomal exchanges found at high dose does not occur at low dose.",Excluded,0.75713855
263,"Clinical features of radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis Carotid arteries frequently receive significant incidental doses of radiation during the treatment of malignant diseases, including head and neck cancer, breast cancer and lymphoma. Vascular injury after treatment may result in carotid artery stenosis and increased risk of neurological sequelae, such as stroke and transient ischaemic attack. The long latent interval from treatment to the development of clinical complications makes investigation of this process difficult, particularly in regard to the design of interventional clinical studies. Nevertheless, there is compelling clinical evidence that radiation contributes to carotid atherosclerosis. This overview examines the effect of radiotherapy on the carotid arteries, the underlying pathological processes and their clinical manifestations.

643,"Identification of novel p53 target genes in ionizing radiation response The tumor suppressor p53 plays an essential role in cellular adaptation to stress. In response to ionizing radiation, p53 regulates the transcription of genes in a diverse set of pathways including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Previously, we identified by microarray analysis a set of genes that are transcriptionally activated or repressed in response to radiation exposure. In this study, we use computational methods and molecular techniques, including location analysis (ChIP-on-chip assay), to identify ionizing radiation-responsive genes that are directly regulated by p53. Among the 489 ionizing radiation-responsive genes examined, 38 genes were found to be p53 targets. Some of these genes are previously known to be directly regulated by p53 whereas others are novel p53 targets. We further showed that the novel p53 target genes are transcriptionally regulated by p53. The binding of p53 to promoters of target genes correlated with increased transcript levels of these genes in cells with functional p53. However, p53 binding and subsequent transcriptional activation of these target genes were significantly diminished in cells with mutant p53 and in cells from patients with ataxia telangiectasia, which have impaired p53 activation following ionizing radiation exposure. Identification and characterization of ionizing radiation-responsive p53 target genes extend our knowledge of the diverse role that p53 plays in the DNA damage response.",Excluded,0.75002307

Spheroids on day-20 with 350 microm diameters were treated with 20 microM resveratrol and/or 6 mM methoxyamine and/or 1 microM iododeoxyuridine for one volume doubling time (67 h), and then irradiated with 2 Gy gamma-radiation ((60)Co) in different groups. After treatment, viability of the cells, colony forming ability and DNA damages were obtained by blue dye exclusion, colony formation and alkaline comet assay, respectively.

598,"High linear energy transfer carbon radiation effectively kills cultured glioma cells with either mutant or wild-type p53 PURPOSE: A mutation in the p53 gene is believed to play an important role in the radioresistance of many cancer cell lines. We studied cytotoxic effects of high linear energy transfer (LET) carbon beams on glioma cell lines with either mutant or wild-type p53.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cell lines U-87 and U-138 expressing wild-type p53 and U-251 and U-373 expressing mutant p53 were used. These cells were irradiated with 290 MeV/u carbon beams generated by the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in the National Institute of Radiologic Science or X-rays. A standard colony-forming assay and flow cytometric detection of apoptosis were performed. Cell cycle progression and the expression of p53, p21, and bax proteins were examined.RESULTS: High LET carbon radiation was more cytotoxic than low LET X-ray treatment against glioma cells. The effects of the carbon beams were not dependent on the p53 gene status but were reduced by G(1) arrest, which was independent of p21 expression. The expression of bax remained unchanged in all four cell lines.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that high LET charged particle radiation can induce cell death in glioma cells more effectively than X-rays and that cell death other than p53-dependent apoptosis may participate in the cytotoxicity of heavy charged particles. Thus, it might prove to be an effective alternative radiotherapy for patients with gliomas harboring mutated p53 gene.",Excluded,0.73578715
1100,"Symptomatic hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients following radiation therapy: a retrospective study Endocrine assessment was performed in 32 relapse-free southern Chinese patients (21 males and 11 females, aged 27-50 years at the time of assessment) 5-17 years following radiation therapy (RT) alone for early nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Initial screening was done using questionnaires emphasizing on impaired sexual function and menstrual disturbance plus measurement of serum levels of thyroxine, free thyroxine index, thyrotropic hormone, prolactin, and additionally testosterone for males only. Those showing abnormalities were subjected to detailed pituitary function tests. Hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction was found in 7 female patients and only 1 male patient. A delayed TSH response to thyrotropin releasing hormone suggesting a hypothalamic disorder was seen in 6 of the affected female patients, and hyperprolactinaemia in also 6. None of the patients had evidence of diabetes insipidus. Hypopituitarism became symptomatic 2-5 years after RT with a mean latent interval of 3.8 years. A practical protocol for regular endocrine assessment for NPC patients after RT has been proposed. Multiple linear regression analysis of the radiotherapeutic data from the 11 female patients indicates that the likelihood of late occurrence of symptomatic hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction following RT is dependent on the TDF of the target dose to the nasopharyngeal region and the height of the upper margin of the opposed lateral facial fields above the diaphragma sellae (coefficient of multiple correlation = 0.9025). Except when the sphenoid sinus or the middle cranial fossa is involved, it is advisable to set the height of the upper margin of the lateral facial field at a level no higher than the diaphragma sellae.

464,"Early skin and lung reactions in breast cancer patients after radiotherapy: prospective study PURPOSE: The association between early radiological lung reactions consequent upon radiotherapy and patients' symptoms is not well established. This prospective study examined the association between symptoms experienced by the patient, clinical findings observed by the physician and reactions visible in chest X-ray as interpreted by a radiologist, as well as the association between skin or breast symptoms and lung symptoms induced by radiotherapy after different methods of surgery.METHODS: Altogether 207 consecutive breast cancer patients entered the trial between 1st October 1997 and 31st December 1998. Chest X-rays were taken at entry and 3, 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. The frequency and intensity of symptoms as well as clinical and chest X-ray findings were assessed over time.RESULTS: Skin and breast symptoms were common after radiotherapy but seldom severe (9%). Lung reactions were seen in chest X-ray in 47% of patients in re-evaluation by a radiologist at 3 months. The frequency of lung or skin symptoms did not correlate with chest X-ray findings, but there was a significant correlation between skin and lung symptoms. Radiotherapy after conservative surgery for node-positive breast cancer caused lung reactions seen in chest X-ray more often than after mastectomy when using other techniques. The reactions were most common at the 6 month evaluation (P=0.01). Concomitant adjuvant chemo- or endocrine therapy did not significantly increase the incidence of lung reactions.CONCLUSIONS: Skin, breast and lung symptoms were frequent after radiotherapy, but there was no real association between lung or skin symptoms and chest X-ray findings. The only correlation noted was between skin or breast symptoms and lung symptoms experienced by patients. Radiotherapy after conservative surgery was more frequently linked to chest X-ray findings than radiotherapy after mastectomy. We conclude that routine chest X-ray after radiotherapy gives no more clinically relevant information than the symptoms of the patient and we do not recommend routine chest X-rays for that reason.",Excluded,0.7293391

596,"GBM And Radiation: The Double-Edged Sword Effects Of Cannabis Purpose/Objective(s): Recent preclinical studies show that cannabidiol (CBD) at clinically relevant doses of 5-20 uM protects normal neural stem/progenitor cells (NSC) and fetal astrocytes from ionizing radiation while directly killing GBM cells. The precise mechanisms for these double-edged sword effects of CBD are unknown. The overall hypothesis of the present study is that CBD, by targeting the numerous signaling pathways (including those that are highly active in GBM), induces an imbalance between cell killing and cell survival mechanisms in cancer cells while demonstrating protective effects on the survival of normal neuronal cells. Materials/Methods: Human GBM cell lines (U87MG, T98G and TS543) and NSC were used as regular 2D or 3D spheroid/neurosphere cultures. Levels of autophagy were examined using LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and confirmed by immunofluorescence staining levels of SQSTM1/p62. Chloroquine (10-50 uM) was used as an inhibitor of autophagic flux. Apoptosis and necrosis were determined using Annexin-V-FITC plus Propidium Iodide staining. Levels of signaling proteins (active versus total) were detected using Western blot analysis and corresponding antibodies. Data were analyzed using the Standard t-test. Result(s): Blockage of autophagy in CBD-treated 3D tumor cultures upregulated radiation-induced cell death only modestly. CBD enhanced the pro-apoptotic activities of JNK1/2 and MAPK p38 signaling cascades by more than 3-fold while partially downregulated the pro-survival PI3K-AKT cascade, thereby enhancing the efficacy of radiation treatment of tumor cells. Co-treatment of CBD-targeted cells with inhibitors of pro-survival and inflammatory pathways effectively killed surviving GBM cells in both 2D and 3D cultures. In contrast, CBD, even at high doses (20 mM), did not induce apoptosis in NSC, but promoted their differentiation into young neurons and glial cells. Conclusion(s): Cannabidiol has both a strong apoptotic and a modest autophagic signaling pathway as shown in several GBM models. Studies to elucidate how these two contrasting pathways may be safely and optimally modulated in CBD treatment of GBM (using 3D cultures and mini-tumor models) are ongoing.

846,"Similarity pattern analysis in mutational distributions The validity and applicability of the statistical procedure - similarity pattern analysis (SPAN) - to the study of mutational distributions (MDs) was demonstrated with two sets of data. The first was mutational spectra (MS) for 697 GC to AT transitions produced with eight alkylating agents (AAs) in the lacI gene of Escherichia coli. The second was a recently summarized data on the distributions of 11562 spontaneous, radiation- and chemical-induced forward mutations in the ad-3 region of heterokaryon 12 of Neurospora crassa. They were analyzed as large two-way contingency tables (CTs) where two kinds of profiles were compared: site (or genotypic class) profiles and origin (or mutagen) profiles. To measure similarity (homogeneity) between any pair of profiles, the relevant sufficient statistics, Kastenbaum-Hirotsu squared distance (KHi<sup>2</sup>), was used. Collapsing the similar profiles into distinct internally homogeneous clusters named 'collapsets' revealed their similarity pattern. To facilitate the procedure, the computer program, COLLAPSE, was elaborated. The results of SPAN for the lacI spectra were found comparable with the results of their previous analysis with two multivariate statistical methods, the factor and cluster analyses. In the ad-3 data set, five collapsets were revealed among origin profiles (OPs): (I) ENU=4NQO=4HAQO=FANFT=SQ18506; (II) AF-2=EI=MMS=DEP; (III) ETO=UV; (IV) AHA=PROCARB; and (V) He ions=protons. Moreover, the previous observation that MDs are dose-dependent was confirmed for X-ray-induced MDs. Profiles induced with the low doses of X-rays are similar to that induced with <sup>85</sup>Sr, and profiles induced with the medium X-ray doses to those induced with protons and He ions. Evaluated similarities appear to be rather reasonable: mutagens with similar mode of action induce similar MDs. Similarity pattern revealed among genotypic class profiles (GCPs) seems to be also interpretable. When supplemented with descriptive cluster analysis, SPAN appears to be a fruitful methodology in MS analysis. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded,0.7185519
964,"Brachial plexus lesions in patients with cancer: 100 cases In patients with cancer, brachial plexus signs are usually caused by tumor infiltration or injury from radiation therapy (RT). We analyzed 100 cases of brachial plexopathy to determine which clinical criteria helped differentiate tumor from radiation injury. Seventy-eight patients had tumor (34 with previous RT), and 22 had radiation injury. Severe pain occurred in 80% of tumor patients but in only 19% of patients with radiation injury. The lower trunk (C7-8, T1) was involved in 72% of the tumors, and 32% also had epidural tumors. Seventy-eight percent of the radiation injuries affected the upper plexus (C5-6). Horner syndrome was more common in tumor, and lymphedema in radiation injury. The time from RT to onset of plexus symptoms, and the dose of RT, also differed. For symptoms within 1 year of RT, doses exceeding 6000 R were associated with radiation damage, whereas lower doses were associated with infiltration. Therefore, painless upper trunk lesions with lymphedema suggest radiation injury, and painful lower trunk lesions with Horner syndrome imply tumor infiltration.",Excluded,0.71553665
821,"Comparison of tumour age response to radiation for cells derived from tissue culture or solid tumours Direct comparison of the cell age of 9L and KHT tumour cells derived either from tissue culture or solid tumours was achieved. Cells from dissociated KHT and 9L tumours (the latter implanted either subcutaneously or intracerebrally) and cells from tissue culture were separated into homogenous sized populations by centrifugal elutriation. In both tumour models these homogeneous sized populations correspond to populations enriched at different stages of the cell cycle. The survival of these elutriated cell populations was measured after a single dose of Cs-137 gamma rays. For cells isolated from 9L solid tumours, there was little variation in radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle; however, a very small but significant increase in resistance was found in late G<inf>1</inf> cells. This lack of a large variation in radiosensitivity through the cell cycle for 9L cells from solid tumours also was seen in 9L cells growing in monolayer tissue culture. When similar experiments were performed using the KHT sarcoma tumour model, the results showed that KHT cells in vitro exhibited a fairly conventional increase in radioresistance in both mid G<inf>1</inf> and late S. However, the cell age response of KHT cells from solid tumours was different; particularly in the late S and G<inf>2</inf> + M phases.

674,"Late effects of intracranial radiation induces resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy that is partially reversible with CSF-1R inhibition Primary and metastatic CNS malignancies remain incurable despite aggressive therapy with surgery and radiation. Immunotherapy has shown promise in many solid and hematologic malignancies, however, results have been disappointing in recurrent primary CNS tumors. Additionally, while upfront immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB) has shown equal efficacy intracranially and extracranially, these responses are abrogated in previously irradiated brain lesions. Together, we hypothesize that radiation modulates the brain microenvironment to permit tumor growth and suppress anti-tumor immunity. As such, we developed a mouse model whereby orthotopic transplantation of murine gliomas into previously irradiated normal brain results in a more aggressive tumor phenotype. Moreover, the ICB-sensitive glioma cell line, GL261, is resistant to ICB therapy when implanted into a previously irradiated brain microenvironment. Immunophenotyping revealed a decreased ratio of CD8:CD4 T cells within tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes isolated from previously irradiated mice though the relative frequency of neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells was slightly increased and no difference in PD-1 expression was observed. Alternatively, the frequency of microglia and tumor-infiltrating CD11b+ Gr-1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was increased following irradiation suggesting a potential role for these myeloid cells in the immunosuppressive effects noted. Consistently, the administration of a CSF-1R inhibitor, which has been shown to reduce the number of microglia and block MDSCs, partially resensitizes GL261 cells to ICB therapy. In summary, we have developed a model that recapitulates the late effects of radiation on immunotherapy-resistance in CNS tumors. Preliminary results suggest that these late radiation effects are mediated through an increased myeloid population, and that inhibition of these cell subsets via the CSF-1R pathway can partially restore efficacy of ICB therapy. Furthermore, this model may provide further insight into additional therapeutic strategies that can be used to overcome these mechanisms of resistance induced by radiation therapy in the CNS.",Excluded,0.7090377
920,"2MO Radiotherapy in cancer is associated with a deletion signature that contributes to poor patient outcomes Background: Diffuse gliomas are highly aggressive brain tumors that invariably relapse despite treatment with chemo- and radiotherapy. Treatment with alkylating chemotherapy can drive tumors to develop a hypermutator phenotype. In contrast, the genomic effects of radiation therapy (RT) remain unknown. Method(s): We analyzed the mutational spectra following treatment with ionizing radiation in sequencing data from 190 paired primary-recurrent gliomas from the Glioma Longitudinal Analysis (GLASS) dataset and 2249 post-treatment metastatic tumors from the Hartwig Medical Foundation. Result(s): We identified a significant increase in the burden of small deletions following radiation therapy that was independent of other factors. These novel deletions demonstrated distinct characteristics when compared to pre-existing deletions present prior to RT-treatment and deletions in RT-untreated tumors. Radiation therapy-acquired deletions were characterized by a larger deletion size (GLASS and metastatic cohort, P=1.2e-02 and P=8e-11, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test), an increased distance to repetitive DNA elements (P<2.2e-16, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and a reduction in microhomology at breakpoints (P=3.2e-02, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These observations suggested that canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) was the preferred pathway for DNA double strand break repair of RT-induced DNA damage. Furthermore, radiotherapy resulted in frequent chromosomal deletions and significantly increased frequencies of CDKN2A homozygous deletions. Finally, a high burden of RT-associated deletions was associated with worse clinical outcomes (GLASS and metastatic cohort, P=4.7e-02, HR=2.59 [95% CI: 1.01, 6.60] and P=2.5e-02, HR=1.43 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.94], respectively; multivariable Cox regression). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that effective repair of RT-induced DNA damage is detrimental to patient survival and that inhibiting c-NHEJ may be a viable strategy for improving the cancer-killing effect of radiotherapy. Taken together, the identified genomic scars as a result of radiation therapy reflect a more aggressive tumor with increased levels of resistance to follow up treatments.

Symptomatic radiation therapy can be delivered, but the best irradiation scheme is still unknown. Results of splenic irradiation in patients with myelofibrosis or chronic leukemia were retrospectively analyzed.PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 24 patients: 15 presented with MF and 9 with CML. Median irradiation doses were 9.8 and 7.7 Gy, respectively. The hematologic toxicity was moderate (except for platelets in the acute phase of the disease).RESULTS: No toxicity was observed. Various factors predictive of the response to radiation therapy are described. While high (around 14 Gy) radiation therapy dose appears necessary for MF and should be started before the increase in transfusion need, huge splenomegalies should be excluded in regard to CML. As for other cases, the optimal dose is still unclear, but should probably be high enough, ie, around 10 Gy.CONCLUSION: To further study and better understand biological mechanisms underlying response to radiotherapy in patients with MF, prospective radio-chemotherapy phase II trials should be conducted in both CML and MF patients.",Excluded,0.6984809

Comparison of dose--response curves of single- and double-mutant strains with wild-type The interactions of mutant alleles that individually confer radiation sensitivity in Neurospora crassa are being studied with regard to their effects on radiation-induced inactivation and forward-mutation induction at the ad-3 loci. This paper reports attempts to construct 3 double-mutant strains containing the following pair-wise combinations of repair-deficient mutants: upr-1,uvs-2; uvs-2,uvs-6; and uvs-3,uvs-6. The double-mutant strain with the 2 excision-repair-deficient mutants upr-1 and uvs-2 shows increased sensitivity to X-ray-induced mutagenesis and inactivation, relative to that shown by either of the parental single-mutant strains. This double mutant is no more sensitive than the parental single-mutant strains to either UV mutagenesis or inactivation. The combination of the uvs-2 and uvs-6 double-mutant strain is considerably more sensitive to both UV and X-ray inactivation than either the uvs-2 or uvs-6 strain, but it shows no greater sensitivity than the parental strains to ad-3 mutation induction by either agent. The combination of the uvs-3 and uvs-6 alleles is inviable. Tetrad analysis and microscopical examination of ascospores shows that ascospores of presumptive genotype uvs-3, uvs-6 do not grow beyond the formation of a few hyphal threads. The lethal and mutagenic effects of UV and X-irradiation in these double-mutant strains are interpreted in terms of the repair systems in Neurospora and other microorganisms.",Excluded,0.6857585

Wilcoxon Sign Ranked tests compared mean severity or pre- and post-RT pain and skin problems within each RT-site subgroup. Multiple linear regression (MLR) investigated associations between skin symptoms and pain.RESULTS: Survey respondents (N = 106) were 58% female and on average 64 years old. RT sites included lung, breast, lower abdomen, head/neck/brain, and upper abdomen. Only patients receiving breast RT reported significant increases in treatment site pain and skin problems (P < or = .007). Patients receiving head/neck/brain RT reported increased skin problems (P < .0009). MLR showed that post-RT skin tenderness and tightness were most strongly associated with post-RT pain (P = .066 and P = .122, respectively).LIMITATIONS: Small sample size, exploratory analyses, and nonvalidated measure.CONCLUSIONS: Only patients receiving breast RT reported significant increases in pain and skin problems at the RT site while patients receiving head/neck/brain RT had increased skin problems but not pain. These findings suggest that the severity of skin problems is not the only factor that contributes to pain and that interventions should be tailored to specifically target pain at the RT site, possibly by targeting tenderness and tightness. These findings should be confirmed in a larger sampling of RT patients.",Excluded,0.67886955

Recently, we identified that translocation of the mu-splice variant of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSmu) and downstream activation of FoxO3a were redox-sensitive phenomena. Prospective sources or reactive oxygen species (ROS) include mitochondria and NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2). We tested the causal role of Nox2 in unloading induced atrophy using a peptidyl inhibitor (gp91ds-tat) with the following groups: ambulatory controls (CON), hindlimb unloaded for 7 days with scrambled sequence (HUScr), and unloading for 7 days + 5 mg/kg/day gp91dsTAT (HUG). Nox2 inhibition provided significant against HU-induced reduction of plantarflexor muscle mass and soleus muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), measured using ImageJ and SMASH programs. There was a trend towards protection against a partial shift in fiber-type shift from slow to fast twitch.

363,"[Operative treatment of mamma carcinoma and its aftermath from the view of radiotherapist (author's transl)] It is reported about 234 patients suffering from postoperative complications after mamma surgery due to carcinoma. All patients were postoperatively treated with a combined telecobalt and x-ray radiation. The results show that serious complications as lymphoedema and periphery neurologic disturbances depend in a great extent on the technique of surgery, especially when the axilla is involved by the cut direction. Postoperative complications of breast cancer are increased only insignificantly by radiatio. Therefore it is suggested to reduce the frequence of radical surgery, and modified radical surgery of breast cancer, in favour of single mastectomy plus postoperative radiation.",Excluded,0.6386848
863,"Mechanisms of radiation-induced brain toxicity and implications for future clinical trials Radiation therapy is widely used in the treatment of primary malignant brain tumors and metastatic tumors of the brain with either curative or palliative intent. The limitation of cancer radiation therapy does not derive from the inability to ablate tumor, but rather to do so without excessively damaging the patient. Among the varieties of radiation-induced brain toxicities, it is the late delayed effects that lead to severe and irreversible neurological consequences. Following radiation exposure, late delayed effects within the CNS have been attributable to both parenchymal and vascular damage involving oligodendrocytes, neural progenitors, and endothelial cells. These reflect a dynamic process involving radiation-induced death of target cells and subsequent secondary reactive neuroinflammatory processes that are believed to lead to selective cell loss, tissue damage, and functional deficits. The progressive, late delayed damage to the brain after high-dose radiation is thought to be caused by radiation-induced long-lived free radicals, reactive oxygen species, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Experimental studies suggest that radiation-induced brain injury can be successfully mitigated and treated with several well established drugs in wide clinical use which exert their effects by blocking pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. This review highlights preclinical and early clinical data that are translatable for future clinical trials. [References: 85]",Excluded,0.6381274
648,"Re-irradiation for recurrent gliomas: Treatment outcomes and prognostic factors Purpose/Objective(s): To analyze the treatment outcomes and prognostic factors of survival for patients with recurrent gliomas treated with reirradiation, and to identify subgroups for whom re-irradiation for recurrent gliomas is most beneficial. Materials/Methods: Thirty-six patients with recurrent or progressive gliomas received re-irradiation between 1996 and 2011. The median age of the patients was 43 years (range, 20-63 years). Pathologic subtypes were glioblastomas in 21 patients (58.3%), WHO grade III astrocytomas in 8 patients (22.2%), and WHO grade I/II astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas in 7 patients (19.4%). In 27 patients, re-irradiation for recurrent gliomas was preceded by subtotal (19/36; 52.8%) or total (8/36; 22.2%) tumor resection. The median time interval between initial radiation therapy (RT) and re-irradiation was 30.5 months (range, 4-173 months). Radiation doses of the first and second radiation course were 32.4-70.0 Gy (median 59.4 Gy) and 30.0-64.6 Gy (median 45 Gy). The cumulative radiation doses were 82.8-123.0 Gy (median 100.2 Gy), and the median cumulative biological equivalent doses (BED) were 195.8 (a/b = 2 Gy) and 102.3 Gy (a/b = 10 Gy). All patients were followed-up until death or the time of analysis. Result(s): Thirty-two patients died of disease 2-50 months after re-irradiation and one patient was alive with disease 12 months after re-irradiation. Three patients are alive without disease 8-50 months after re-irradiation. The median overall survival (OS) was 10.5 months (range, 2-50 months), and the 6 and 12months OS rates were 83.3 and 39.4%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.5 months, and 6-months and 12-months PFS rates were 71.09 and 41.7%, respectively. In univariate analysis, the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) <=70 (p<0.001), the dose of re-irradiation <=40 Gy(p = 0.019), and the length of time interval between initial RT and re-irradiation(p = 0.029) were associated with improvement in OS. In multivariate analysis, KPS (p=0.033) was the most important predictors for OS. Histologic subtype (GBM vs non-GBM, median OS, 8 vs 12 months, p=0.668) and surgical resection (median OS, 9 vs 12 months, p = 0.810) had no significant benefit on OS. Radiographically suspected radiation necrosis (RN) after re-irradiation was seen in 6 patients (16.7%) whose median cumulative radiation doses were 100.4 Gy, and a median cumulative BED were 198.4 Gy (a/b=2 Gy). At 3, 7 and 8 months after re-irradiation, neurological deterioration occurred in 3 patients, and was managed with dexamethasone and anticonvulsant drug. Conclusion(s): Approximately 45 Gy of re-irradiation after 60 Gy of initial radiation therapy was feasible without serious complications. Re-irradiation could be suggested as an alternative salvage treatment for selected recurrent glioma patients with good performance status and recurrence over a longer period of time.",Excluded,0.6371254

We evaluated WM changes attributable to WBRT as grade 0-6 and assessed possible contributing factors by statistical analysis.RESULTS: WM changes were found in 20 patients: Eight were assessed as grade 2, three as grade 3, and nine as grade 5. In total, 12 patients developed grade 3 or higher WM changes. Age (<60 vs > or =60 years), sex, radiation dose (< or =35 vs >35 Gy), chemotherapy (with CDDP vs without CDDP), biologically effective dose (< or =120 vs >120 Gy1), and head width (<16.3 vs > or =16.3 cm) were found not to be relevant to the incidence or severity of the WM changes.CONCLUSION: Long-term survivors who have under-gone WBRT may have a higher incidence of WM abnormalities.",Excluded,0.635305
542,"The influence of head and neck radiation on obstructive sleep apnea Objectives: The co-incidence of sleep disorders in cancer patients has been described but the impact of head and neck radiation on the development of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is not specifically known. Our objective was to assess the incidence of OSA in head and neck cancer (HNSCC) patients treated with radiation. Method(s): We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients with oropharyngeal or laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with primary radiation therapy. Patients underwent a 3-night home sleep study (HST) and completed the Epworth Sleepiness scale (ESS) and Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ-10). Exclusion criteria included any oncologic surgical procedure, active disease, or completion of radiation therapy within the past 3 months. Result(s): To date, 14 patients have been enrolled who are an average of 63.2 years old, with a mean body mass index of 29.2, and 93% male. Nine of 14 patients had human papillomavirus- positive tumors and were of laryngeal (4), tonsillar (5), and base of tongue (5) origin. The mean ESS and FOSQ- 10 were 7.6 and 33.3, respectively. Of the 4 patients who have completed the HST, all had OSA (2 severe, 1 moderate, and 1 mild) with a mean apnea-hypopnea index of 26.1 and mean oxygen nadir of 74%. Three of 4 patients demonstrated Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern in the absence of traditional risk factors such as neurologic disease or heart failure.

652,"The treatment options of recurred brain metastasis after prophylactic cranial irradiation in patients with small-cell lung cancer Background: Even after prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), many small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients succumb to brain metastasis. Brain metastasis after PCI is an unsolved issue in SCLC in terms of its dismal prognosis and the limitation of further treatment options. Regarding the treatment option, it is not determined whether re-whole brain radiotherapy (re-WBRT) is safe or gamma-knife surgery (GKS) has its role in SCLC. We investigated which treatment option could be recommended as the up-front therapy to improve survival for SCLC patients with brain metastasis who were previously treated with PCI. Method(s): The medical records were reviewed for SCLC patients who experienced brain metastases after receiving PCI from 2000 to 2010. We compared overall survival according to the modality of up-front therapy. Overall survival was determined as time from brain metastasis to death due to any cause. Result(s): In total, 245 patients had received PCI in a state of limited disease (n = 204) or extensive disease status (n = 41). Among them, 47 (19.2%) experienced brain metastases: 16.7% (34/204) in LD and 31.7% (13/41) in ED. At the time when brain metastasis developed, extracrainal disease was also on progressing state in 19 patients (40.4%). The modality of up-front therapy for brain metastasis was as follows: 17 (36.1%) got GKS, 14(29.8%) re-WBRT, 7 (14.9%) up-front chemotherapy without local therapy, and 9 (19.1%) did not receive any further treatment. The median overall survival after brain metastasis was 4.9 months. Among 31 patients who received GKS or re-WBRT, 10 patients received at least one subsequent chemotherapy in their lifetime after GKS (6/17, 35.3%) or re-WBRT (4/14, 28.6%). The median survival of GKS, re-WBRT and chemotherapy was 14.3, 3.9 and 6.0 months (P = 0.24), which showed the tendency favoring for up-front GKS. Although it failed to meet statistical significance. Conclusion(s): The up-front GKS showed longer survival in patients who experienced brain metastasis after PCI for SCLC, compared with re-WBRT or chemotherapy only. However, the number of participants was too small to get confirmatory results requiring a prospective therapy to demonstrate the role of GKS in this setting.",Excluded,0.6179273
837,"Riluzole enhances ionizing radiation-induced cytotoxicity in human melanoma cells that ectopically express metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 in vitro and in vivo PURPOSE: Brain metastases are a common preterminal event in patients with metastatic melanoma and require radiation therapy. Our group has previously shown that human GRM1 (hGRM1) expressing melanoma cells release excess extracellular glutamate and are growth inhibited by riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamate release. Riluzole-treated cells accumulate in G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle at 24 hours, and then undergo apoptotic cell death. We evaluated whether riluzole enhanced radiosensitivity in melanoma cells.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Clonogenic assays were performed to evaluate clonogenic survival after treatment in hGRM1 expressing and nonexpressing melanoma cells. Western immunoblots were performed to confirm apoptotic cell death. A xenograft mouse model was used to validate the in vitro experiments. Tumors harvested from the xenografts were fixed and stained for apoptosis and DNA damage markers.RESULTS: In the hGRM1-positive cell lines C8161 and UACC903, riluzole enhanced the lethal effects of ionizing radiation; no difference was seen in the hGRM1-negative UACC930 cell line. C8161 cells treated with riluzole plus irradiation also showed the highest levels of the cleaved forms of PARP and caspase-3; excised C8161 xenografts showed the greatest number of apoptotic cells by immunohistochemistry (P < 0.001). On cell cycle analysis, a sequence-dependent enrichment in the G(2)/M phase was shown with the combination of riluzole and irradiation. Xenografts treated with riluzole and weekly radiation fractions showed significant growth inhibition and revealed markedly increased DNA damage.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown, in vitro and in vivo, that the combination of riluzole and ionizing radiation leads to greater cytotoxicity. These results have clinical implications for patients with brain metastases receiving whole brain radiation therapy.",Excluded,0.60740983
297,"Combined modality therapy including intraoperative electron irradiation for locally recurrent colorectal cancer PURPOSE: To evaluate survival, relapse patterns, and prognostic factors in patients with colorectal cancer relapse treated with curative-intent therapy, including intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: From April 1981 through January 2008, 607 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer received IOERT as a component of treatment. IOERT was preceded or followed by external radiation (median dose, 45.5 Gy) in 583 patients (96%). Resection was classified as R0 in 227 (37%), R1 in 224 (37%), and R2 in 156 (26%). The median IOERT dose was 15 Gy (range, 7.5-30 Gy).RESULTS: Median overall survival was 36 months. Five- and 10-year survival rates were 30% and 16%, respectively. Survival estimates at 5 years were 46%, 27%, and 16% for R0, R1, and R2 resection, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that R0 resection, no prior chemotherapy, and more recent treatment (in the second half of the series) were associated with improved survival. The 3-year cumulative incidence of central, local, and distant relapse was 12%, 23%, and 49%, respectively. Central and local relapse were more common in previously irradiated patients and in those with subtotal resection. Toxicity Grade 3 or higher partially attributable to IOERT was observed in 66 patients (11%). Neuropathy was observed in 94 patients (15%) and was more common with IOERT doses exceeding 12.5 Gy.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival and disease control was achievable in patients with locally recurrent colorectal cancer. Continued evaluation of curative-intent, combined-modality therapy that includes IOERT is warranted in this high-risk population.",Excluded,0.6012549
1073,"[Palliation of brain metastases: factors associated with survival] One hundred ten patients with brain metastases (76 lung cancer, 11 breast cancer, 7 colorectal cancer and others) were treated with radiotherapy, and the results were retrospectively evaluated. Neurologic symptoms were improved in 66% of patients. The relationship between improvement of neurologic symptoms and several factors, including irradiation dose, primary lesion, histology, term between first treatment and recurrence, clinical symptoms and CT findings, was analyzed. There was no significant correlation between symptom relief and these factors except for the number of metastatic lesions. Four of 110 patients could survive more than 2 years after radiotherapy: one with lung cancer, one with breast cancer, one with rectum cancer and one with uterine cancer. The factors that were analyzed for symptom relief were also studied to determine their effect on the survival of lung cancer patients with brain metastases. The patients who had higher dose irradiation (50 Gy) of improvement of neurological symptoms after radiotherapy survived significantly longer than those who had 30 Gy of irradiation or no symptom relief. Multivariate analysis of these factors showed that improvement of symptoms and irradiation dose were similarly important prognostic factors, whereas the others were not correlated with survival.",Excluded,0.5772515
452,"A patient questionnaire for radiation-induced brachial plexopathy We analyzed the usefulness of a symptom questionnaire to screen for radiation-induced brachial plexopathy (RIBP) after breast cancer treatment. Four questions addressed distal and proximal paresis: impaired hand functions, problems raising the arm, carrying weights, and lifting objects from a high shelf. Eighty-one relapse-free patients were neurologically examined. Treatment was mastectomy (51%) or breast-conserving surgery (49%), radiotherapy to the supraclavicular +/- axilla with median 60 Gy maximum dose. Sixty-five subsequent control patients had breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy to the breast only with 55 Gy median dose. Median follow up was 10 and 7.4 years, respectively. Sixteen patients had RIBP, 7 had Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 1, 4 grade 2, 3 grade 3, and 2 grade 4 RIBP. Thirty-seven patients had fibrosis and 32 had arm edema. Four patients with RIBP had no fibrosis (n = 2) or fibrosis of the axilla only (n = 2). Specificity of the question ""impaired hand functions"" for RIBP was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.78); sensitivity was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.52-0.96). Specificity of the question ""raising the arm"" was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.9-0.99) and sensitivity was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.04-0.45); the rate of false-positive control patients was 3%. In multivariate analysis, ""impaired hand functions"" and fibrosis were independent indicators of RIBP (P <0.005). Patients with breast irradiation only stated moderate/pronounced impaired hand functions; and problems carrying weights and lifting objects from a high shelf in 38%, 58%, and 77%, not significantly different from patients with RIBP or the patients with supraclavicular radiation. RIBP is not necessarily associated with fibrosis. The aim of the questionnaire was screening of a population at risk for RIBP. In this group, the question ""problems raising the arm"" detected severe RIBP with high specificity. Negation of ""impaired hand functions"" excludes RIBP.

The paper presents the results of ultrasonic investigations of the heart, arterial and venous peripheral vessels in different parts of human body, and measurements of leg veins capacity with the use of occlusive plethysmograpy. It was shown that in the resting condition such prime hemodynamic parameters as the pumping function of the heart and blood supply of the brain, and integral parameters, i.e. arterial pressure and heat rate, were best ""protected"" as they demonstrated stability throughout long exposure in microgravity. In the absence of gravitational stimulation, arterial resistance went down in essentially all vascular regions below the heart level; to put it differently, the anti-gravity distribution of the vascular tone was annulled gradually as unneeded in microgravity. Compared with the data about arteries, venous hemodynamics was found to be particularly sensitive considering the early advent and significance of changes. Venous return slowed down, resistance of the lower body vessels declined and capacity of the leg venous net increased. Functional testing with the lower body negative pressure revealed degradation of the gravity-dependent reactions that became more conspicuous as flight duration extended further. Cardiovascular deconditioning showed itself clearly on return to Earth's gravity by decreased g-tolerance during re-entry and orthostatic instability post flight. These investigations provided objective evidence for multifactorial genesis of orthostatic instability during space flight including blood redistribution, altered tone regulation of leg's venous and arterial vessels and hypovolemia.",Excluded,0.56752896
1154,"Neuromuscular activation patterns during treadmill walking after space flight Astronauts adopt a variety of neuromuscular control strategies during space flight that are appropriate for locomoting in that unique environment, but are less than optimal upon return to Earth. We report here the first systematic investigation of potential adaptations in neuromuscular activity patterns associated with postflight locomotion. Astronaut-subjects were tasked with walking on a treadmill at 6.4 km/h while fixating a visual target 30 cm away from their eyes after space flights of 8-15 days. Surface electromyography was collected from selected lower limb muscles and normalized with regard to mean amplitude and temporal relation to heel strike. In general, high correlations (more than 0.80) were found between preflight and postflight activation waveforms for each muscle and each subject: however relative activation amplitude around heel strike and toe off was changed as a result of flight. The level of muscle cocontraction and activation variability, and the relationship between the phasic characteristics of the ankle musculature in preparation for toe off also were altered by space flight. Subjects also reported oscillopsia during treadmill walking after flight. These findings indicate that, after space flight, the sensory-motor system can generate neuromuscular-activation strategies that permit treadmill walking, but subtle changes in lower-limb neuromuscular activation are present that may contribute to increased lower limb kinematic variability and oscillopsia also present during postflight walking.",Excluded,0.5657456

We propose that one or several of the humoral factors necessary for the growth of pituitary adenomas is missing in these experimental environments. The purpose of our experiments was to examine the possible influence of the hypothalamus in supporting cellular proliferation, and thus adenoma growth. Fragments from four human pituitary adenomas (three pituitary prolactinomas; one ACTH-secreting adenoma) were transplanted into the pituitary fossa of total-body irradiated, hypophysectomized rats. The rats were killed after two weeks and perfused with a mixture of formalin and India ink. Histologic examination of serial sagittal sections through the pituitary fossa and the adjacent brain showed: vascularization of the grafts from the pituitary stalk and from the scar tissue in the sphenoid bone; survival of some adenomas; and numerous mitoses in an ACTH-secreting specimen obtained from a patient who had Cushing's disease.

Method(s): Participants were assessed using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck module (MDASI-HN), with subsequent analysis. Result(s): Of the 122 participants analyzed, the majority (63%) had no frank detectable cognitive impairment by TICS, with frank impairment in 6%. Overall, mean patient-reported problems with memory (MDASI<inf>memory</inf>) was 3.3 (SD +/-2.66).

Information was collected on IDDS function, treatment goals, treatment fields, prescribed doses, treatment energies, and cumulative radiation doses to the pump and the catheter.RESULTS: A total of 39 patients received 60 separate courses of radiation therapy, of which 12 patients received radiation with either the pump or the catheter in the field. The remaining patients received scatter radiation only. The goal of radiation was palliative in all but one of the patients. Cumulative pump doses ranged from 5 to 36 Gy, and catheter doses ranged from 15 to 45 Gy. Beam energies ranged from 6 to 18 MV photons. All devices were checked after the completion of radiotherapy with a median follow-up of 4.5 months, and all were found to be in good working condition.CONCLUSIONS: IDDS failures related to external beam radiation therapy seem to represent a rare occurrence.

442,"Relative contributions of radiation and cisplatin-based chemotherapy to sensorineural hearing loss in head-and-neck cancer patients PURPOSE: To investigate the risk of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in patients with head-and-neck cancer and treated with radiation therapy (RT) or concomitant cisplatin-based chemoradiation, the relationship among SNHL and radiation dose to the cochlea, the use of two common cisplatin dose regimens.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 62 head-and-neck cancer patients treated with curative intent were included in this prospective study. Of the patients, 21 received RT alone, 27 received 40 mg/m(2) weekly cisplatin, 13 received 100 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks during RT, and 1 received RT with weekly epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor antibody. The effect of chemotherapy and RT dose on hearing was determined using a model that accounted for the age and variability between each ear for each patient.RESULTS: We constructed a model to predict dose-dependent hearing loss for RT or cisplatin-based chemotherapy either alone or in combination. For patients only receiving RT, no significant hearing loss was found at doses to the cochlea of less than 40 Gy. Patients receiving 100 mg/m(2) or 40 mg/m(2) of cisplatin chemotherapy had an estimated +21.5 dB and +9.5 dB hearing loss at 8,000 Hz with low radiation doses (10 Gy), which rose to +38.4 dB and +18.9 dB for high radiation doses (40 Gy).CONCLUSIONS: Use of RT alone with doses of less than 40 Gy did not result in clinically significant hearing loss. High-frequency SNHL was profoundly damaged in patients who received concomitant cisplatin when doses of 100 mg/m(2) were used. The threshold cochlear dose for hearing loss with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and RT was predicted to be 10 Gy. The inner ear radiation dose constraints and cisplatin dose intensity should be considered in the treatment of advanced head-and-neck cancer.",Excluded,0.5188574

195,"Weiss Lecture. Effects of radiations of different qualities on cells: molecular mechanisms of damage and repair Studies of ionizing radiations of different quality are discussed with particular emphasis on damage to DNA of mammalian cells. Three related themes are followed. Firstly, inactivation and mutation experiments with ultrasoft X-rays and slow heavy ions, coupled with theoretical analyses of the structures of the radiation tracks, have emphasized the biological importance of localized track features over nanometre dimensions. This led to the suggestion that the critical physical features of the tracks are the stochastic clusterings of ionizations, directly in or very near to DNA, resulting in clustered initial molecular damage including various combinations of breaks, base damages, cross-links, etc. in the DNA. The quantitative hypotheses imply that final cellular effects from high-LET radiations are dominated by their more severe, and therefore less repairable, clustered damage, and that these are qualitatively different from the dominant low-LET damage. Second, relative effectiveness of different types of radiation led to questions on the mechanisms of induction of chromosome exchanges. The high efficiency of ultrasoft X-rays, despite their very short track lengths, suggested that single sites of DNA damage may lead to exchanges by a molecular process involving interaction with undamaged DNA. Also it is shown that a single site-specific DNA break, introduced by restriction enzymes, sometimes leads to a large deletion when misrepaired by cell extracts. These deletions occur between short DNA repeats, and are therefore a form of 'illegitimate' recombination, but clearly do not involve the interaction of two damage sites. Third, it was shown that cells from patients with the radiosensitive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) lack a post-irradiation recovery process. The sensitivity of AT cells to high LET radiations was found to be reduced relative to that for normal cells, reinforcing the concept that high LET damage is less easy to repair. AT patients are prone to lymphoreticular cancers, and their cells show characteristic chromosomal rearrangements, which may be associated with misrepair at specific genomic sequences. Similarly, studies of radiation-induced leukaemia in the mouse have implicated rearrangement at specific interstitial chromosome sites, which are rich in telomere-like repeat sequences.

172,"Frequent occurrence of therapeutically reversible CMV-associated encephalopathy during radiotherapy of the brain BACKGROUND: Neurological decline during radio(chemo)therapy of the brain is often attributed to disease progression or side effects of radiotherapy. Diagnosis of opportunistic neurotropic infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections is uncommon, even though high-grade gliomas and some brain metastases are known to contain CMV particles. We prospectively examined the frequency of CMV encephalopathy during radiotherapy of the brain.METHODS: Fifty patients requiring whole-brain radiotherapy for brain metastases (n = 27) or local radio(chemo)therapy of the brain for high-grade gliomas (n = 23) were observed in the prospective observational GLIO-CMV-01 study. MRIs and blood samples were obtained before, halfway through, and at the end of radiotherapy. MRIs were screened for disease progression or increased intracranial pressure. Blood was tested for anti-CMV immunoglobulin (Ig)M, anti-CMV IgG, and CMV DNA.RESULTS: Thirty-two of 50 (64%) patients were positive for anti-CMV IgG before radio(chemo)therapy. Fifteen of those 32 (48%) developed viremia during or up to 28 days after treatment. Thirteen of those 15 (87%) required treatment for CMV-associated encephalopathy. MRIs were negative for disease progression, edema, or bleeding. None of the patients negative for anti-CMV IgG developed viremia, suggesting a reactivation rather than a primary infection. In the group at risk consisting of anti-CMV IgG+ patients, age >65 (P = .004) and the amount of dexamethasone taken during radio(chemo)therapy (P = .004) were associated with an increased risk for CMV-associated encephalopathy. One hundred and fifty days after the start of radio(chemo)therapy, survival was 74% (14/19) (no encephalopathy) versus 54% (7/13) (encephalopathy) (odds ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.03-1.86; P = .25).CONCLUSION: CMV reactivation frequently causes encephalopathy during radio(chemo)therapy of the brain. The unexpected high incidence of this infection makes it highly clinically relevant for every treating physician.",Excluded,0.50970715
999,"Pneumonectomy for lung cancer after preoperative concurrent chemotherapy and high-dose radiation BACKGROUND: We studied the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing pneumonectomy after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation for non-small cell lung cancer.METHODS: Clinical records of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent pneumonectomy at our institution between 1995 and 2005 after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation were reviewed retrospectively.RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients underwent pneumonectomy after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation. Of the 21 men and 8 women who were treated, 1 had stage IIB (T3N0M0) and the remainder had stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. Mean patient age at surgery was 53.4 years. There were 15 right pneumonectomies, of which 2 were for pancoast tumors. All patients received concurrent preoperative chemoradiation. Mean total radiation dose was 61.1 Gy. All patients went on to have complete (R0) resection by pneumonectomy. Pathologic complete response was found in 16 patients (55.2%). All patients were discharged alive from the hospital after pneumonectomy. Median hospital length of stay was 5 days (mean 8.6). Ninety-day mortality after surgery was 3.4% (n = 1). Recurrences have been found in 11 patients (38%), including brain metastases (n = 6), bone metastases (n = 4), liver metastases (n = 2), and cervical lymph node metastases (n = 2). One patient had a contralateral new primary lung cancer develop 70 months after undergoing pneumonectomy. Estimated 5-year disease-free survival is 48%. Median survival time has not been reached.CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonectomy can be performed safely after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation, even with high-dose radiation. The frequency of disease recurrence in the brain underscores the need to evaluate the role of prophylactic cranial radiation in non-small cell lung cancer.",Excluded,0.50511533

890,"5-Aminolevulinic acid strongly enhances delayed intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by ionizing irradiation: quantitative analyses and visualization of intracellular ROS production in glioma cells in vitro Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy has important roles in multimodal treatment for highly aggressive malignant gliomas. Previously, we demonstrated that multi-dose ionizing irradiation with repetitive administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) enhanced the host antitumor response and strongly inhibited tumor growth in experimental glioma. However, the mechanism of the radiosensitizing effect of 5-ALA is not known. Ionizing irradiation not only causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation initially by water radiolysis but also induces delayed production of mitochondrial ROS for mediating the long-lasting effects of ionizing irradiation on tumor cells. 5-ALA leads to high accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the mitochondria of tumor cells, yet can also improve dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in tumor cells. Here, we assessed the effect of 5-ALA-induced PpIX synthesis and delayed production of intracellular ROS after ionizing irradiation with 5-ALA in glioma cells in vitro. Temporal changes in intracellular 5-ALA-induced PpIX synthesis after ionizing irradiation in glioma cell lines were evaluated using flow cytometry (FCM). Then, the effect of 5-ALA on delayed production of intracellular ROS 12 h after ionizing irradiation in glioma cells was evaluated by FCM and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Ionizing irradiation had no effect on 5-ALA-induced PpIX synthesis in glioma cells. Delayed intracellular production of ROS was significantly higher than that just after ionizing irradiation, but 5-ALA pretreatment strongly enhanced the delayed intracellular production of ROS, mainly in the cytoplasm of glioma cells. This 5-ALA-induced increase in the delayed production of ROS tended to be higher in the case of 5-ALA treatment before rather than after ionizing irradiation. These results suggest that 5-ALA can affect tumor cells under ionizing irradiation, and greatly increase secondary intracellular production of ROS long after ionizing irradiation, thereby causing a radiosensitizing effect in glioma cells.",Excluded,0.50246143
1160,"Role of hippocampal location and radiation dose in glioblastoma patients with hippocampal atrophy Background: The hippocampus is a critical organ for irradiation. Thus, we explored changes in hippocampal volume according to the dose delivered and the location relative to the glioblastoma. Method(s): All patients were treated for glioblastoma with surgery, concomitant radiotherapy and temozolomide, and adjuvant temozolomide. Hippocampi were retrospectively delineated on three MRIs, performed at baseline, at the time of relapse, and on the last MRI available at the end of follow-up. A total of 98, 96, and 82 hippocampi were measured in the 49 patients included in the study, respectively. The patients were stratified into three subgroups according to the dose delivered to 40% of the hippocampus. In the group 1 (n = 6), the hippocampal D<inf>40%</inf> was < 7.4 Gy, in the group 2 (n = 13), only the H<inf>contra</inf> D<inf>40%</inf> was < 7.4 Gy, and in the group 3 (n = 30), the D<inf>40%</inf> for both hippocampi was > 7.4 Gy. Result(s): Regardless of the time of measurement, homolateral hippocampal volumes were significantly lower than those contralateral to the tumor. Regardless of the side, the volumes at the last MRI were significantly lower than those measured at baseline. There was a significant correlation among the decrease in hippocampal volume regardless of its side, and D<inf>max</inf> (p = 0.001), D<inf>98%</inf> (p = 0.028) and D<inf>40%</inf> (p = 0.0002). After adjustment for the time of MRI, these correlations remained significant. According to the D<inf>40%</inf> and volume at MRI<inf>last</inf>, the hippocampi decreased by 4 mm<sup>3</sup>/Gy overall. Conclusion(s): There was a significant relationship between the radiotherapy dose and decrease in hippocampal volume. However, at the lowest doses, the hippocampi seem to exhibit an adaptive increase in their volume, which could indicate a plasticity effect. Consequently, shielding at least one hippocampus by delivering the lowest possible dose is recommended so that cognitive function can be preserved. Trial registration Retrospectively registered.
