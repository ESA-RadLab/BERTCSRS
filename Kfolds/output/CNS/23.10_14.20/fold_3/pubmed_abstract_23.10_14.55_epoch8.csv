3623,"Novel free-hand T1 pedicle screw method: Review of 44 consecutive cases SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Multilevel posterior cervical instrumented fusions are becoming more prevalent in current practice. Biomechanical characteristics of the cervicothoracic junction may necessitate extending the construct to upper thoracic segments. However, fixation in upper thoracic spine can be technically demanding owing to transitional anatomy while suboptimal placement facilitates vascular and neurologic complications. Thoracic instrumentation methods include free-hand, fluoroscopic guidance, and CT-based image guidance. However, fluoroscopy of upper thoracic spine is challenging secondary to vertebral geometry and patient positioning, while image-guided systems present substantial financial commitment and are not readily available at most centers. Additionally, imaging modalities increase radiation exposure to the patient and surgeon while potentially lengthening surgical time.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 44 consecutive patients undergoing a cervicothoracic fusion by a single surgeon using the novel free-hand T1 pedicle screw technique between June 2009 and November 2012. A starting point medial and cephalad to classic entry as well as new trajectory were utilized. No imaging modalities were employed during screw insertion. Postoperative CT scans were obtained on day 1. Screw accuracy was independently evaluated according to the Heary classification.RESULTS: In total, 87 pedicle screws placed were at T1. Grade 1 placement occurred in 72 (82.8%) screws, Grade 2 in 4 (4.6%) screws and Grade 3 in 9 (10.3%) screws. All Grade 2 and 3 breaches were <2 mm except one Grade 3 screw breaching 2-4 mm laterally. Only two screws (2.3%) were noted to be Grade 4, both breaching medially by less than 2 mm. No new neurological deficits or returns to operating room took place postoperatively.CONCLUSIONS: This modification of the traditional starting point and trajectory at T1 is safe and effective. It attenuates additional bone removal or imaging modalities while maintaining a high rate of successful screw placement compared to historical controls.",Excluded,0.086056285
3624,"Anxiety and cognition in histamine H3 receptor-/- mice Histamine H(3) receptors (H3Rs) were first characterized as autoreceptors modulating histamine release and synthesis via negative feedback. Acute H3R stimulation or blockade with selective agonists and antagonists suggests a role for H3R in anxiety and cognition. However, little is known about the long-term effects of H3R blockade on brain function. In the current study, mice lacking H3 receptors (H3R(-/-)) were used to investigate the role of H3R-mediated signalling in anxiety and cognition. H3R(-/-) mice showed enhanced spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze. In addition, H3R(-/-) mice showed reduced measures of anxiety in the elevated plus and zero mazes involving exploratory behaviour and avoidable anxiety-provoking stimuli, but enhanced acoustic startle responses involving unavoidable anxiety-provoking stimuli. These behavioural alterations were associated with higher arginine vasopressin levels in the central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala. These findings support a role for H3Rs in mediating histamine effects on spatial learning and memory and measures of anxiety.",Excluded,0.085938215
3625,"Richter's syndrome in the brain first manifested as an ischaemic stroke Isolated central nervous system involvement in Richter's syndrome (RS) is extremely rare and only 6 such cases have been described, so far. We report a 60-year-old woman with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) heavily pretreated with cladribine based regimens and rituximab in whom RS in the brain was first manifested as a stroke. Initial cranial computed tomography (CT) revealed a hypodense area in the right parietal lobe showing no contrast enhancement. The follow-up CT done after 2 months showed an irregular, slightly hyperdense tumor surrounded by oedema with mass effect and midline shift. However, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations revealed no pathological changes. Neurosurgical operation was performed and the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been established on the basis of histological and immunological investigation of the tumor. The pattern of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement in the patients' bone marrow aspirate and brain tumor was identical and suggested that both tumors originated from the same B-cell progenitors. The patient was then treated with brain irradiation (2000 cGy) and complete remission as assessed by MRI was achieved. Significant neurological improvement was observed and no clinical progression was stated 3 months after radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.086636946
3627,"Treating the contents and not the container: Dosimetric study of hair-sparing whole brain intensity modulated radiation therapy Hematogenous metastatases are the most common adult central nervous system malignancies. The standard treatment of these patients continues to include whole brain radiation. An unavoidable toxicity of this treatment is acute iatrogenic alopecia. This alopecia is a significant cause of patient distress. Our purpose was to quantify the sparing of the hair bearing skin that could be achieved by using a complex hair-sparing approach. To achieve this goal, we treat an anthropomorphic phantom with both conventional and inverse-planned intensity-modulated portals. The skin dose was evaluated through dose-volume histograms and thermo-luminescent dosimetry. The median calculated dose was reduced by 38%. The average measured dose at five surface points was reduced by 53% - from 95% of the prescription dose with the conventional plan, to 44%, with the IMRT plan. This sparing was achieved while maintaining adequate target coverage. Because of the low radiation tolerance of the hair follicle, this dose reduction is not expected, on its own, to eliminate radiation alopecia but bears promise in combination with other toxicity-sparing strategies.

3628,"Medical Event Management for Future Deep Space Exploration Missions to Mars BACKGROUND: Long-duration exploration missions (LDEMs), such as voyages to Mars, will present unique medical challenges for astronaut crews, including communication delays and the inability to return to Earth early. Medical events threaten crewmember lives and increase the risk of mission failure. Managing a range of potential medical events will require excellent technical and nontechnical skills (NTSs). We sought to identify medical events with potential for rescue, range them according to the potential impact on crew health and mission success during LDEMs, and develop a list of NTSs to train for management of in-flight medical events.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight subject matter experts with specializations in surgery, medicine, trauma, spaceflight operations, NTS training, simulation, human factors, and organizational psychology completed online surveys followed by a 2-d in-person workshop. They identified and rated medical events for survivability, mission impact, and impact of crewmember NTSs on outcomes in space.RESULTS: Sudden cardiac arrest, smoke inhalation, toxic exposure, seizure, and penetrating eye injury emerged as events with the highest potential mission impact, greatest potential for survival, and that required excellent NTS for successful management. Key NTS identified to target in training included information exchange, supporting behavior, communication delivery, and team leadership/followership.CONCLUSIONS: With a planned Mars mission on the horizon, training countermeasures need to be developed in the next 3-5 y. These results may inform policy, selection, medical system design, and training scenarios for astronauts to manage in-flight medical events on LDEMs. Findings may extend to surgical and medical care in any rural and remote location.",Excluded,0.0859951
3629,"Stereotactic gamma knife radiosurgery as an effective treatment for acromegaly INTRODUCTION: Pituitary tumors causing acromegaly are treated primarily by surgical resection. If not curative, further treatment is needed. 'Gamma Knife' stereotactic radiosurgery enables single fraction delivery of highly focused radiation to a pituitary target. Aim(s): To assess the effectiveness of gamma knife radiosurgery for acromegaly. METHOD(S): Data was retrospectively collected from 35 patients in eight regional centers, via the UK National Acromegaly Register. All patients had neurosurgery and a Perfexion Gamma Knife (Elekta, Stockholm) was used for radiosurgery at one institution (Sheffield, UK). The mean peak dose was 53 Gy. RESULT(S): Biochemical: Of thirty-five patients, 66% achieved a normal age and sex-adjusted IGF-1 atmedian follow up of 65months after gamma knife. Of thirty-two patients tested, 72% achieved controlled (<2.5ug/L) nadir GH level, median follow up of 60 months; of these patients 35%(n=8) were also receivingmedical therapy. Themean IGF-1 before and after gamma knife was 777 ug/L and 436 ug/L, respectively (p = 0.015). Mean GH level before gamma knife in 24 patients was 5.62 ug/L and after was 1.25 ug/L (p = 0.0051). The probability of control of IGF-1 and GH levels did not correlate with dose of radiation delivered. Radiological: Post gamma knife MRI demonstrated pituitary tumor size unchanged or reduced in 100%of 24 patients atmedian followup of 50.5months. Endocrine Side Effects: 17% (6/35) developed new endocrine disturbances. Of these three were being treated with medical therapy.Other side effects: No patient suffered visual disturbance on follow-up. CONCLUSION(S): Gamma knife radiosurgery for acromegaly is safe and effective long-term adjunctive treatment.",Excluded,0.08987494
3630,"Relapsed multiple myeloma presenting as CNS myelomatosis Background: A 68-year old man with a history of IgA lambda-restricted multiple myeloma was transferred to our hospital for suspected worsening disease following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) 4 months prior. He presented to his primary physician with diplopia, nausea and vomiting, and worsening back pain in the setting of complete bone marrow remission and negative oncology work up at day +100 from ASCT. MRI after a fall revealed multifocal epidural and intrathecal masses at T8-T11, an enhancing pituitary mass, and scattered decreased T1 signal consistent with myelomatous involvement of the calvarium. CSF cytology and biopsy of the spinal lesions showed malignant plasma cells. The patient underwent whole brain and thoracic spine radiation, but succumbed on hospital day 7. An autopsy was requested. Design(s): Standard dissection of the thoraco-abdominal organ block revealed a consolidated pneumonia of the entire left lung with visceral pleural involvement by myeloma and associated diaphragmatic adhesions. Gross lesions of the axial skeleton were not identified. Gross examination of the brain and spinal cord was unremarkable. The pituitary gland was grossly enlarged and nodular. The brain and partial spinal cord were fixed in 10% formalin for 21 days. Result(s): Microscopic examination of brain sections revealed diffuse leptomeningeal involvement by CD138+, lambda-restricted malignant plasma cells. The cerebellum demonstrated myeloma cells tracking into perivascular spaces of the parenchyma. The pituitary showed near replacement of the neurohypophysis with myeloma. Malignant plasma cells were also identified in the lung parenchyma, visceral pleura and focally within the thyroid. Conclusion(s): Neurologic sequelae of multiple myeloma are common, but usually secondary to direct extension or compression of nerve structures due to bone lesions. CNS myelomatosis is rare, with a 1% estimated incidence. It has been reported in patients with presumed complete remission of disease; several cases reported in patients who are post ASCT. CNS involvement of multiple myeloma has an invariably poor prognosis, and there is no standardized treatment approach. Due to prior case reports of CNS involvement in presumed disease remission following ASCT and the present case with its acute and fulminant presentation, diagnostic suspicion of CNS involvement by myeloma should be routinely considered in patients with a history of myeloma and new neurologic findings on clinical exam. A complete neuropathological assessment should be included in autopsies of such patients, particularly in the setting of grossly normal CNS findings.",Excluded,0.08615253
3632,"Associations among magnetic resonance spectroscopy, apparent diffusion coefficients, and image-guided histopathology with special attention to radiation necrosis OBJECTIVE: In patients with malignant glioma previously treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, clinical and radiographic signs of recurrent disease often require differentiation between radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor. Published work suggests that although magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can reliably differentiate pure tumor, pure necrosis, and spectroscopically normal tissues, it may not be particularly helpful because most patients have mixed histological findings comprised of necrosis and tumor. To improve our clinical ability to discriminate among these histological entities, we have analyzed MRS in conjunction with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences derived from magnetic resonance imaging.METHODS: In 18 patients, spectroscopic and diffusion-weighted images were obtained before surgery for suspected recurrent neoplastic disease. Spectral data for pure tumor, pure necrosis, and mixed tumor and necrosis were derived from 65 spectroscopic observations in patients with previously treated gliomas (n = 16) and metastatic tumors (n = 2). Spectral data for choline (Cho), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), and lipid-lactate were analyzed separately and in conjunction with ADCs in all patients (15 observations of pure tumor, 33 observations of pure necrosis, and 13 observations of mixed tumor and necrosis). Histological specimens were obtained stereotactically at the time of surgery (<48 h after image acquisition) for recurrent disease and digitally co-registered with MRS data.RESULTS: ADC values for pure tumor, pure necrosis, and mixed tumor and necrosis were 1.30, 1.60, and 1.42, respectively. Cho/NAA less than 0.20, NAA/normal Cr greater than 1.56, and NAA/Cho greater than 1.32 increase the odds that a tissue biopsy will be pure necrosis versus mixed tumor and necrosis. Although various values of all MRS ratios analyzed may provide positive correlations for histopathological differentiation of tissue between that of pure tumor and that of pure necrosis, the addition of ADC values to only NAA/Cho and NAA/normal Cr increases the odds of correct differentiation between pure tumor and pure necrosis. The addition of ADC values does not provide additional information beyond that of MRS in distinguishing specimens of mixed tumor and necrosis from either pure tumor or pure necrosis.CONCLUSION: It has been demonstrated that MRS ratio analysis may allow for the clinical discrimination between specimens of pure tumor and pure necrosis, and the addition of ADC data into this analysis may enhance this specific differentiation. However, although a trend toward correlation between ADC values and the various histopathological features was noted, the direct addition of ADC data does not seem to allow further discrimination, beyond that provided by MRS, among specimens of mixed tumor and necrosis and either pure tumor or pure necrosis.",Excluded,0.08701697
3633,"Merkel cell carcinoma: recent progress and current priorities on etiology, pathogenesis, and clinical management PURPOSE: To expedite improved understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare malignancy of cutaneous neuroendocrine cells that has a 28% 2-year mortality rate.METHODS: This article summarizes a workshop that discussed the state-of-the-art research and priorities for research on MCC and on a new human polyomavirus (ie, MCPyV) recently discovered in 80% of MCC tumors.RESULTS: Normal Merkel cells are widely distributed in the epidermis near the end of nerve axons and may function as mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors. Malignant MCC cells typically stain for cytokeratin 20 as well as for other epithelial and neuroendocrine markers. MCC subtypes, which are based on histology, on cell line growth properties, and on gene expression profiles, have been reported but have not been linked to prognosis. Clinical management has been empiric. MCPyV is clonally integrated at various sites in the human genome of MCC tumors, with truncating mutations in the viral, large T antigen gene that interrupt viral replication. MCPyV seroprevalence may be high, as with previously known human polyomaviruses. MCC risk is increased 11-fold with AIDS and with other cell-mediated immune deficiencies, B-cell neoplasms, and ultraviolet radiation exposure.CONCLUSION: Development and validation of a range quantitative polymerase chain reaction and serologic assays for detection of MCPyV, as well as an infectious clone of the virus, would clarify the fundamental biology, natural history, and epidemiology of the virus, of MCC, and of other diseases. Contingent on standardized histologic diagnosis and staging of MCC, consortia are needed to clarify the risks and benefits of sentinel lymph node biopsy, adjuvant radiation therapy, and salvage therapies; consortia are needed also for epidemiologic studies of MCC etiology.

3634,"Clinical and radiographic outcome of treatment of thoracolumbar fractures without neurology. open vs percutaneous C-arm: Guided vs percutaneous 3d navigation: Guided pedicle screw fixation Introduction: Recently, as an alternative for the open pedicle screw fixation (OPSF) of thoraco-lumbar fractures (TLF), percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) has evolved to minimize soft tissue injury and perioperative morbidity. The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of three different methods of neurologically intact TLF treatment: OPSF, minimally invasive two-plane conventional fluoroscopy-guided (FPPSF) and navigation-guided (N-PPSF). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 137 patients underwent either OPSF (n = 50) or F-PPSF (n = 39) or N-PPSF (n = 48) for stabilization of TLF between 2014 and 2016 in two Departments (Orthopaedics and Neurosurgery). Radiographs were obtained before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the final follow-up for assessment of the restoration of the spinal column. For radiologic parameters, Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle, and vertebral body compression ratio were evaluated on lateral thoracolumbar radiographs. As a method of clinical evaluation, the intraoperative blood loss, operation time, radiation dose, postoperative hospital stay, the postoperative scar size and perioprative complications. Result(s): There were significant differences between open and both percutaneous methods of treatment in surgical blood loss and postoperative hospital stay in favour of percutaneous and without significant difference between F-PPSF and N-PPSF. The time of the surgery was the shortest in OPSF and F-PPSF. The radiation dose was both the highest for the patient and the lowest for the operative team in N-PPSF. The length of the postoperative scar was equal for all groups. There were five infections of the operative wound and one implant loosening in OPSF group without any significant complication. Postoperative VAS decreased significantly in all groups and there was a significant difference in favour of percutaneous techniques groups at the time of discharge and after 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months postoperatively. There were no statistical differences in VAS. For both F-PPSF and N-PPSF ODI was significantly better 6 weeks after the surgery than for OPSF without any difference between all groups at the final follow-up. The regional sagittal Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle and anterior height of the fractured vertebra all significantly improved in each group immediately after the surgery and at the final follow-up. Conclusion(s): Both percutaneous pedicle screw fixation techniques were comparable except the radiation dose for the operative team, which was the lowest in N-PPSF group. Although all three groups showed favorable outcomes at the final follow-up, F-PPSF and N-PPSF provided earlier pain relief, better functional improvement, less perioperative complications but worse early postoperative radiological outcome in comparison with OPSF.",Excluded,0.137639
3635,"Myelomatous involvement of the dura mater: A rare complication of multiple myeloma A case of myelomatous involvement of the dura mater is reported. The patient presented with blurring of vision in the right visual field and left sided facial numbness. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head revealed extensive infiltration of the dura mater. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed no plasmacytosis and although there was a raised CSF protein concentration, no paraprotein band was detected, despite the presence of serum paraprotein. The infiltration of the dura mater is likely to have arisen by spread from contiguous bone lesions, contrasting with the pattern of spread seen in myelomatous involvement of the leptomeninges, which probably occurs through haematogenous seeding of the meninges. Leptomeningeal involvement is associated with a very poor prognosis; however, this patient had a favourable response to combined chemotherapy and cranial radiotherapy, suggesting that myelomatous involvement of the dura mater should be considered as a distinct complication of myeloma.",Excluded,0.08662001

Method(s): The trypan blue was used to examine cell viability before and after treatment, and real time PCR to analyze the expression of microRNAs in time 0h (immediately after treatments), and 48h after the exposure to treatments. Result(s): The analysis of cell viability showed no statistically significant difference among the studied groups. The oncogene miR-21 demonstrated a significantly higher expression in neurospheres in group treated with ionizing radiation (both 0h and 48h). The tumor suppressors microRNAs miR-15 and miR-16 had no significant expression among cell types and treatments modalities submissions. However, miR-15 and miR-16 had a considerably different expression between the analyzed periods: miR-15 in the time 0h was highly expressed in adherent cells treated with ionizing radiation and temozolomide; and, during the 48 hour analysis, miR-15 was more expressed in neurospheres with the same type of treatment. The same expression profile happened with the miR-16, however being more expressed in the group treated with ionizing radiation.

An 11-residue segment, which we term NACore, appears to be responsible for amyloid formation and cytotoxicity of human alpha-synuclein. Here we describe crystals of NACore that have dimensions smaller than the wavelength of visible light and thus are invisible by optical microscopy. As the crystals are thousands of times too small for structure determination by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we use micro-electron diffraction to determine the structure at atomic resolution. The 1.4 A resolution structure demonstrates that this method can determine previously unknown protein structures and here yields, to our knowledge, the highest resolution achieved by any cryo-electron microscopy method to date. The structure exhibits protofibrils built of pairs of face-to-face beta-sheets. X-ray fibre diffraction patterns show the similarity of NACore to toxic fibrils of full-length alpha-synuclein. The NACore structure, together with that of a second segment, inspires a model for most of the ordered portion of the toxic, full-length alpha-synuclein fibril, presenting opportunities for the design of inhibitors of alpha-synuclein fibrils.",Excluded,0.08587558
3639,"Different levodopa actions on the extracellular dopamine pools in the rat striatum Levodopa has been the mainstay treatment for Parkinson's disease for several decades, but the precise mechanism for its therapeutic action is still not well understood. To date, little distinction has been made between the effects of levodopa on the different brain DA pools. We studied the levodopa action on two extracellular DA pools: one was analyzed by microdialysis (often considered as indicative of volume transmission) and the other by in vivo amperometry during nigrostriatal cell stimulation (more indicative of neurotransmission). Levodopa administration induced a moderate (increased 200%) and tardy (began at 60 min) increase in the DA-pool measured by microdialysis, an effect that increased (increased 500%) and accelerated (began at 10 min) after DA-cell degeneration. Levodopa action on the DA-pool measured by amperometry was very fast (10 min) and prominent (increased 600%) in normal rats. The DA-denervated striatum showed a fast exhaustion during cell stimulation, which prevented further study of the levodopa effect on the DA amperometry-pool under this condition. This study suggests a different kinetic for levodopa action on the volume transmitter and neurotransmitter DA-pool, showing marked changes in levodopa action in the denervated striatum.",Excluded,0.08572635

To improve diagnostic chest imaging utilization, we conducted 3 prospective multicenter studies over 12years to derive and validate decision instruments (DIs) to guide the use of chest x-ray (CXR) and chest computed tomography (CT). The first DI, NEXUS Chest x-ray, consists of seven criteria (Age >60years; rapid deceleration mechanism; chest pain; intoxication; altered mental status; distracting painful injury; and chest wall tenderness) and exhibits a sensitivity of 99.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 98.2-99.4%) and a specificity of 13.3% (95% CI, 12.6%-14.0%) for detecting clinically significant injuries. We developed two NEXUS Chest CT DIs, which are both highly reliable in detecting clinically major injuries (sensitivity of 99.2%; 95% CI 95.4-100%). Designed primarily to focus on detecting major injuries, the NEXUS Chest CT-Major DI consists of six criteria (abnormal CXR; distracting injury; chest wall tenderness; sternal tenderness; thoracic spine tenderness; and scapular tenderness) and exhibits higher specificity (37.9%; 95% CI 35.8-40.1%). Designed to reliability detect both major and minor injuries (sensitivity 95.4%; 95% CI 93.6-96.9%) with resulting lower specificity (25.5%; 95% CI 23.5-27.5%), the NEXUS CT-All rule consists of seven elements (the six NEXUS CT-Major criteria plus rapid deceleration mechanism).

3643,"Exposure to different wavelengths of light and the development of structural and functional asymmetries in the chicken The thalamofugal visual projections of the chick are known to develop in response to stimulation by light prior to hatching, and asymmetry in the number of projections develops as a consequence of the embryo being oriented in the egg so that it occuludes its left eye. The right eye only is stimulated by light and this causes the visual projections connected to the right eye to develop in advance of those connected to the left. We have now found that exposure of embryos, from day 19 of incubation to hatching, to red (peak transmission at 670 nm) or green (peak at 500 nm) light is as effective as broad-spectrum (white) light in establishing asymmetry in these projections. The intensities of the light to which the embryos were exposed in each case were equivalent, achieved in part by removing the air sac end of the egg shell. The thalamofugal visual projections, therefore, develop in response to light stimulation but appear to have no wavelength specificity. This result is consistent with the apparent lack of involvement of the thalamofugal visual pathway in colour vision. However, functional asymmetry, tested as left-right eye differences in categorising grain from pebbles, was found to be less marked in the chicks that had been exposed to green light compared to those that had been exposed to 'while' light, and it was absent in those exposed to red light or incubated in the dark. Thus, there is wavelength specificity for the development of the behavioural asymmetry, which suggests involvement of colour-coded neurons outside the thalamofugal visual pathway, probably in the tectofugal pathway. Exposure of the embryos to red and green light alternating at 30 min intervals is as effective as ""white' light for establishing both the structural and functional asymmetry.",Excluded,0.08672056
3644,"Rapid activation of presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by nerve-released transmitter Nicotine's ability to enhance neurotransmitter release has implicated presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in synaptic modulation, but there aze few examples where presynaptic nAChRs are known to be activated by nerve-released transmitter. We searched for endogenous activation of presynaptic nAChRs in the calyceal nerve terminals of the chick ciliary ganglion by imaging presynaptic calcium transients using dextran-coupled indicator dyes. The amplitude of Ca(+)signals recorded in individual nerve terminals was frequency dependent over 2-50 Hz. Calcium transients evoked by stimulation of the preganglionic nerve were significantly reduced (approximately 10-15%) by the nonspecific nAChR antagonist d-tubocurarine (d-TC; 100 microM) and the alpha7-specific antagonist methyllycaconitine (20-50 nM) but were not affected by 10 microM dihydro-beta-erythroidine, which should inhibit several non-alpha7 nAChRs. Feedback was rapid and did not require a stimulation-dependent build-up of transmitter, as d-TC and MLA reduced the amplitude of the first calcium transient in a 2-Hz train. Choline is an agonist at alpha7 nAChRs but is not the sole agonist in this system, as inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by echothiophate failed to reduce calcium transients. These results show that nerve-released acetylcholine (ACh) feeds back onto presynaptic alpha7 nAChRs to enhance calcium signals within the terminal. This feedback may help maintain the high rate of transmission at this cholinergic synapse.",Excluded,0.08567108
3645,"Radiation therapy for melanoma: Adjuvant, palliative and abscopal effects Radiation therapy (RT) has long played a role in the management of melanoma, however historically its efficacy has been questioned due to the perceived radioresistance of melanoma cells in vitro. Apart from proton therapy for choroidal melanoma, RT has limited accepted indications as a definitive treatment. Surgery remains the first line therapy of choice for operable patients and adjuvant RT can be considered for high-risk primary tumours. Prospective randomised data are awaited following a Phase II TROG study reporting high local control rates (93%) following postoperative nodal irradiation in selected patients with node-positive melanoma. High response rates of melanoma (e.g. mucosal or inoperable) to primary radiotherapy have also been reported. Local radiation can achieve tumour-antigen release and clinical results suggest biological interaction with immunomodulating agents (a checkpoint inhibitor and anti-CTLA4 antibody), corroborated by preclinical data. Much interest also lies in enhancing melanoma radiation response rates through combination with clinical hyperthermia, which can achieve radiosensitisation, at least in part, by immune modulation. Novel developments in radiotherapy include the rise in radiosurgical treatment (SRS), involving high dose, small volume irradiation. SRS is increasingly the palliation of choice for patients with two or more brain metastases, following resection of a single brain metastasis and for extra-cranial oligometastases. The results of a Phase III trial evaluating whole brain radiotherapy are awaited. The radiobiological consequences of SRS may be even more immunomodulatory, congruent with retrospective data that fraction sizes greater than 4 Gray are more effective and SRS alone has been suggested to induce an abscopal effect. To date there are limited data reporting SRS with concomitant immunomodulators and the optimal combinations remain to be defined. Serious toxicities have been reported following administration of B-RAF inhibitors with and subsequent to both SRS and fractionated RT. Combination strategies are being actively researched as these should increase the effectiveness of radiation in the management of patients with melanoma by widening the therapeutic window between normal tissue toxicity and melanoma cell kill, and by potentially inducing an out-offield abscopal effect.",Excluded,0.08612764

3647,"ESTIMATION OF THE EFFECTS OF GEOMAGNETIC AND SOLAR ACTIVITY ON THE HUMAN BRAIN BIOELECTRICAL PROCESSES WITH STRUCTURAL FUNCTION. [Russian] We investigate the impacts of sharp variations in solar and geomagnetic activity (GMA) at high latitudes on the human brain bioelectrical activity by means of the empirical structure function of multi-channel EEG. Ten healthy men ages 19 to 37 took part in the study. EEG was recor- ded daily over the 25 days test period that was marked by C- and M-class solar flares and geomagnetic storm levels in the G2-G3 range. The EEG signals were used for the estimate of the mul-tivariate temporal structure function (SF) of the first order in 8-dimensional space. The value of the SF correlation radius is used here as an estimation of a scale of the integral temporal correlation structure of multi-channel EEG, while the value of the SF horizontal asymptote is used as an estimation of the spatial correlation structure of EEG. It is shown that GMA variations make an even greater impact on the SF correlation radius, than on the SF asymptote. We reveal the disturbing and modulating effects of geomagnetic and solar activity on the SF parameters and its power spectrum. Thus, the SF of multi-channel EEG allows us to estimate the effects of heliogeophysical factors on the integrated brain reaction as a unitary system and may be used to investigate the environmental influence on the humans.",Excluded,0.090509415

The localisation of SV2A in the synaptic terminals makes it a viable target for in vivo imaging of synaptic density in the brain. Several SV2A targeting compounds have been evaluated as PET tracers, including [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J, with the aim to facilitate studies of synaptic density in neurological diseases. The original two-step synthesis method failed in our hands to produce sufficient amounts of [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J, but served as an excellent starting point for further optimizations towards a high yielding and simplified one-step method.

3651,"Effect of acute light exposure upon melatonin content, NAT activity, and nuclear volume in the gerbil pineal complex This report describes the response of both the superficial and deep components of the gerbil pineal gland to a 30-min pulse of fluorescent light at the time of the nocturnal peak in pineal activity. When gerbils were maintained in a 14 h light:10 h dark photoperiod, mean melatonin concentrations in the superficial pineal gland ranged between 72 and 108 pg/gland during the day and first 4 h of darkness, rose to a peak of 399 pg/gland 7 h after lights out, then returned to basal levels at the expected time of light onset. Pineal melatonin contents were reduced to daytime values within 30 min after exposure of gerbils to fluorescent light at the time of the nocturnal peak. These changes in superficial pineal melatonin content reflected the circadian pattern in serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity, as would be expected if NAT controls melatonin synthesis. In addition to the reductions in NAT and melatonin content induced by nocturnal photic stimulation, there was a 30% reduction in mean pinealocyte nuclear volume. A nocturnal elevation in melatonin content but not in NAT activity occurred in the deep pineal gland. Unlike the superficial pineal gland, the deep pineal gland did not demonstrate a response in melatonin content, NAT activity, or pinealocyte nuclear volumes upon exposure of gerbils to light at the time of the nocturnal peak in superficial pineal activity.",Excluded,0.08807245
3652,"Structural basis of microtubule severing by the hereditary spastic paraplegia protein spastin Spastin, the most common locus for mutations in hereditary spastic paraplegias, and katanin are related microtubule-severing AAA ATPases involved in constructing neuronal and non-centrosomal microtubule arrays and in segregating chromosomes. The mechanism by which spastin and katanin break and destabilize microtubules is unknown, in part owing to the lack of structural information on these enzymes. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the Drosophila spastin AAA domain and provide a model for the active spastin hexamer generated using small-angle X-ray scattering combined with atomic docking. The spastin hexamer forms a ring with a prominent central pore and six radiating arms that may dock onto the microtubule. Helices unique to the microtubule-severing AAA ATPases surround the entrances to the pore on either side of the ring, and three highly conserved loops line the pore lumen. Mutagenesis reveals essential roles for these structural elements in the severing reaction. Peptide and antibody inhibition experiments further show that spastin may dismantle microtubules by recognizing specific features in the carboxy-terminal tail of tubulin. Collectively, our data support a model in which spastin pulls the C terminus of tubulin through its central pore, generating a mechanical force that destabilizes tubulin-tubulin interactions within the microtubule lattice. Our work also provides insights into the structural defects in spastin that arise from mutations identified in hereditary spastic paraplegia patients.

3654,"Optogenetic disruption of sleep continuity impairs memory consolidation Memory consolidation has been proposed as a function of sleep. However, sleep is a complex phenomenon characterized by several features including duration, intensity, and continuity. Sleep continuity is disrupted in different neurological and psychiatric conditions, many of which are accompanied by memory deficits. This finding has raised the question of whether the continuity of sleep is important for memory consolidation. However, current techniques used in sleep research cannot manipulate a single sleep feature while maintaining the others constant. Here, we introduce the use of optogenetics to investigate the role of sleep continuity in memory consolidation. We optogenetically targeted hypocretin/orexin neurons, which play a key role in arousal processes. We used optogenetics to activate these neurons at different intervals in behaving mice and were able to fragment sleep without affecting its overall amount or intensity. Fragmenting sleep after the learning phase of the novel object recognition (NOR) task significantly decreased the performance of mice on the subsequent day, but memory was unaffected if the average duration of sleep episodes was maintained at 62-73% of normal. These findings demonstrate the use of optogenetic activation of arousal-related nuclei as a way to systematically manipulate a specific feature of sleep. We conclude that regardless of the total amount of sleep or sleep intensity, a minimal unit of uninterrupted sleep is crucial for memory consolidation.",Excluded,0.08604725
3655,"Disuse Osteoporosis: Clinical and Mechanistic Insights Disuse osteoporosis describes a state of bone loss due to local skeletal unloading or systemic immobilization. This review will discuss advances in the field that have shed light on clinical observations, mechanistic insights and options for the treatment of disuse osteoporosis. Clinical settings of disuse osteoporosis include spinal cord injury, other neurological and neuromuscular disorders, immobilization after fractures and bed rest (real or modeled). Furthermore, spaceflight-induced bone loss represents a well-known adaptive process to microgravity. Clinical studies have outlined that immobilization leads to immediate bone loss in both the trabecular and cortical compartments accompanied by relatively increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation. The fact that the low bone formation state has been linked to high levels of the osteocyte-secreted protein sclerostin is one of the many findings that has brought matrix-embedded, mechanosensitive osteocytes into focus in the search for mechanistic principles. Previous basic research has primarily involved rodent models based on tail suspension, spaceflight and other immobilization methods, which have underlined the importance of osteocytes in the pathogenesis of disuse osteoporosis. Furthermore, molecular-based in vitro and in vivo approaches have revealed that osteocytes sense mechanical loading through mechanosensors that translate extracellular mechanical signals to intracellular biochemical signals and regulate gene expression. Osteocytic mechanosensors include the osteocyte cytoskeleton and dendritic processes within the lacuno-canalicular system (LCS), ion channels (e.g., Piezo1), extracellular matrix, primary cilia, focal adhesions (integrin-based) and hemichannels and gap junctions (connexin-based). Overall, disuse represents one of the major factors contributing to immediate bone loss and osteoporosis, and alterations in osteocytic pathways appear crucial to the bone loss associated with unloading.

3656,"Technology insight: Image-guided robotic radiosurgery - A new approach for noninvasive ablation of spinal lesions The need for an effective noninvasive tool to ablate spinal lesions reflects the limitations of traditional surgical and radiotherapeutic approaches. Open surgery is invasive and carries a risk of neurological injury and vertebral column dysfunction. Conventional radiotherapy often has poor clinical efficacy and a risk of neurologic complications. Spinal radiosurgery has been developed to overcome these limitations. This technique consists of precise delivery of high-dose radiation to a spinal target. To spare the delicate and radiation-sensitive spinal cord and to avoid potentially devastating neurological complications, it is essential that the radiation dose decreases rapidly outside of the target. This is accomplished by use of advanced, image-guidance technology, treatment planning software, and robotics. Preliminary data indicate that this approach can achieve high rates of tumor control of spinal and paraspinal lesions and durable reduction of associated vertebral pain without neurological complications. Although spinal radiosurgery is not yet widely practiced, the benefits of this new therapeutic approach are likely to encourage its widespread adoption in coming years.",Excluded,0.0859409

3659,"Effects of escitalopram challenge on white matter integrity in obsessive-compulsive disorder and healthy controls Background: Involvement of the serotonergic system in OCD is well-known, with OCD responding to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Chronic use of SSRIs changes brain connectivity in OCD, and a single dose of an SSRI dramatically alters functional connectivity throughout the brain in healthy subjects. The question is raised whether acute administration of an SSRI can also significantly alter white matter integrity in the brain of patients with OCD. Method(s): OCD patients (n=20) and matched healthy controls (n=24) received a single dose of escitalopram 20mg on one day, and a single dose of placebo on another day, in randomized order, under double-blind conditions. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to compare white matter integrity of the whole brain between the groups. The impact of the SSRI challenge on white matter in these two study groups were subsequently investigated, controlling for age. Result(s): There were no significant interaction effects (diagnostic group x pharmacological challenge) or effects in the OCD group separately. In controls, the escitalopram challenge had a significant impact on white matter diffusivity of the left post thalamic radiation (PTR-L) (F=7.84; p=0.01), the superior corona radiata bilaterally (SCR: F=7.99; p=0.01) and the sagittal stratum bilaterally (SS: F=6.64; p=0.02). In these tracts, FA was significantly higher and RD significantly lower after the pharmacological challenge compared to placebo. Discussion(s): Acute administration of an SSRI did not significantly alter white matter integrity in the brain of OCD patients. It did however improve white matter integrity in tracts that connect regions that may be affected in OCD, in controls. DTI-derived parameters are differently affected in OCD and healthy controls, respectively, in structures within the fronto-striatothalamo-cortical loop after chronic SSRI treatment. Alteration of white matter integrity may occur in OCD with longer treatment duration or at a different dosage with plasticity potentially playing a role.",Excluded,0.09351754

In vitro neocortical slices from adult irradiated and control animals were examined in physiologic solution and in the presence of the A-type gamma-amino butyric acid (GABAA) receptor antagonist, bicuculline methiodide. Epileptiform bursts were quantified by counting the number of negative field potentials per epileptiform event. In the presence of bicuculline, neocortical slices with cortical dysplasia demonstrated more robust epileptiform activity in the form of an increased number of negative field potentials per epileptiform event.

3661,"Glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic currents in ganglion cells from isolated retinae of pigmented rats during postnatal development This study was aimed at characterizing the earliest phases of synaptogenesis in the mammalian retina. Spontaneous activity of ganglion cells in the isolated superfused retina was used as an indicator for the functionality of synaptic connections. Retinal ganglion neurons (RGNs) were identified by location of their somata in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and by their ability to generate large (> 500 pA) voltage-activated sodium currents. Spontaneous spiking was found in many RGNs prior to cell perfusion. Between postnatal day (P) 1 and 18, a total of 195 RGNs was tested for light-induced currents, conductance changes in response to exogenous glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and depolarizing or hyperpolarizing synaptic activity. The vast majority of the material was derived from RGNs at day P5. Whole-cell ion currents were always sampled at somatic sites, using either conventional or perforated patch whole-cell recordings. On day P5, 5% of tested RGNs (n = 73) were already responsive to light stimulation. A higher percentage of cells (23%, n = 187) generated spontaneous depolarizing currents that were regarded as glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), since (1) they were blocked by Glu antagonists, (2) they conformed to the Na+/Cs+ equilibrium potential, (3) and they displayed a time course characteristic of glutamatergic EPSCs. The mean EPSC amplitude was 19.0 pA (S.D. 11.83 pA). Amplitude distributions were fitted by multiple Gaussian equations rendering a quantal size of 6.6 to 9.1 pA at a holding voltage (Vh) of -70 mV (driving force about 70 mV). Spontaneous EPSCs were never observed under condition of Ca(2+)-free solutions, but they persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin. Bath application of quisqualate (500 microM) consistently increased EPSC frequencies. In contrast to the relatively high percentage of RGNs generating spontaneous EPSCs, very few RGNs at P5 (3%, n = 187) displayed inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), although by that time all tested RGNs (n = 14) were responsive to both exogenous Glu and GABA. These results indicate that in the postnatal rat retina development of excitatory synapses precedes the maturation of inhibitory afferents. Excitatory inputs to RGNs were to some extent functional before the animals opened their eyes. Glutamatergic synaptic activity may, thus, play an important role in shaping visual connections in the absence of visual experience.",Excluded,0.1093232

3664,"Cranial irradiation and central hypothyroidism Cranial irradiation causes thyrotropin (TSH)-releasing hormone (TRH) secretory abnormalities. TRH deficiency leads to abnormal glycosylation of TSH alpha and beta subunits and loss of the normal circadian pattern of TSH secretion (low in the afternoon, a surge in the evening, higher at night). This disruption results in either mixed hypothyroidism (raised TSH with abnormal secretory kinetics) or central hypothyroidism (abnormal secretory kinetics without raised TSH). Although primary hypothyroidism is more common in the general population and cancer survivors, the cumulative incidence of central and mixed hypothyroidism is high during the ten years after cranial irradiation. Monitoring for decline in free thyroxine (FT(4)) and rise in serum TSH, and early recognition using TSH surge and TRH tests, are clinically valuable. Early thyroid hormone replacement therapy to achieve serum FT(4) in the upper half of the normal range is crucial for maintaining optimal health and growth in cancer survivors.

The data from 13 patients treated between 1984 and 2006 satisfied the World Health Organization 2007 definition of Grade III meningioma. A total of 24 surgeries were performed, including 13 primary, 7 salvage, and 4 second salvage.

3666,"Melatonin secretion following brain midline irradiation is diminished, but not correlated with subjective sleep disturbances Objective: Cranial irradiation for brain tumours or leukaemias has been related to cognitive, endocrine and psychosocial late effects as well as sleep disturbances and increased daytime sleepiness. Studies suggest that cranial irradiation might impact on pineal melatonin secretion. Melatonin is an important regulator in human circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle. The objective of this study was to investigate melatonin secretion, subjective sleep parameters and their interplay in a cohort of cranially irradiated head and brain tumour and leukaemia survivors at least 3 years after radiotherapy. Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Patient(s): Thirty-eight adults. Measurements: Melatonin secretion was evaluated by measuring its metabolite 6-sulphatoxymelatonin in collected overnight urine. Subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The Beck Depression Inventory II was used to screen for depressive symptoms because of their impact on sleep. Result(s): Patients irradiated in the brain midline had significantly lower melatonin secretion (P = 0.008). Subjects exhibited a high prevalence of sleeping difficulties, daytime sleepiness and depression, with females and overweight subjects particularly affected. Melatonin values and subjective sleep parameters did not correlate with each other or with treatment and most patient variables. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that radiation exposure to the pineal gland negatively affects melatonin secretion. This lack of pineal melatonin does not influence subjective sleep quality. As melatonin has important antioxidant and cancer-protective effects, further research is necessary to elucidate whether these patients have an increased risk of developing secondary neoplasms and other radiation late effects.

3668,"A reappraisal of the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited small cell lung cancer The use of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited stage small cell lung cancer remains controversial. Prospective trials have demonstrated that PCI can reduce central nervous system relapse rates, but the impact on survival remains questionable except for the possible evidence of a beneficial effect for long term survivors. With higher rates of thoracic control now obtainable with hyperfractionated radiation and concomitant chemotherapy, it becomes important to analyze the benefit of PCI in that setting. Before 1982, we included PCI in the management of all patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer; thereafter, we discontinued its use. This report compares the outcome of the two treatment approaches and addresses the role of PCI among patients who achieve durable local control. There were 36 limited stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with PCI from 1979-1982 and 26 patients treated without PCI from 1985-1989. Induction chemotherapy was followed in both groups by thoracic irradiation (45 Gy). The PCI patients received 30 Gy to the whole brain in 10 fractions. Both groups received maintenance chemotherapy. Of complete responders, brain failure was the first failure in 18% (4/22) of PCI (+) versus 45% (10/22) of PCI (-) (p = .04). Survival at 2 years was 42% for PCI (+) versus 13% for PCI (-) (p less than .05). When the analysis was limited to those patients permanently controlled in the thorax; there were 25% (4/16) brain failures PCI (+) versus 70% (7/10) PCI (-) (p = .03). For this same subset the 2-year survival was 56% PCI (+) versus 14% PCI (-) (p less than .05). There were no 5 year survivors without PCI compared to 38% (6/16) with PCI.

Time-domain NIRS (TD-NIRS) uses pulsed light attenuation at multiple wavelengths (600-950 nm) to discretely quantify oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin and determine total hemoglobin, oxygen saturation (OS) and cerebral blood volume (BV) in the region between each light source and detector. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of employing a novel TD-NIRS technology to assess absolute levels of cerebral BV and OS with broad spatial coverage in order to detect regions of ischemia. Method(s): Ischemic stroke (IS) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients underwent TD-NIRS measurements. IS patients were fitted with a rectangular probe over the region of ischemia (2 rows of 4 sources between 3 rows of 5 detectors), using CT as a guide (external acoustic meatus as reference). SAH patients were fitted with a linear ""anterior crown"" probe with light sources and detectors arranged alternating in a single row (7 sources, 6 detectors). Clearance above the frontal sinus was guided by CT imaging (nasion as reference). 1.8 cm separated all source-detector pairs. Time-correlated single photon-counting photomultiplier tubes detected photons to measure absorption of pulsed light emitted at 3 wavelengths (690, 805, and 835 nm). Maximal OS (OSmax) and BV (BVmax) were calculated for the entire region measured by the probe to enable multiple comparisons. Result(s): In IS patients, ischemic regions (n=4) had an OSmax of 65.8 SD 13.1; contralateral normal tissue had an OSmax of 85.3 SD 27.1 (paired t-test; p 0.14). Ischemic regions had a BVmax of 76.25 SD 24.17 compared with 104.0 SD 42.5 in contralateral normal tissue (p 0.18). Regional inspection showed good visual correlation with infarcts (Figure). Of SAH patients with serial measures (n=2), one developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and bilateral infarcts, coincident with decreased BVmax on the right (72, day 1; 48, day 12) and left (153, day 1; 56, day 12); OS did not change. Conclusion(s): We were able to calculate multiregional BV and OS for patients with cerebral ischemia. Despite small sample size, we demonstrated a trend between contralateral (ischemic stroke) and historical (subarachnoid hemorrhage) controls.

Personal interviews were conducted with 33 individuals who had received radiotherapy for head and neck cancers. These individuals described their treatment experiences and identified the most troublesome and debilitating side effects of radiotherapy. Overall, lethargy and weakness, dry mouth, mouth sores and pain, taste changes, and sore throat were the most frequently reported troublesome or debilitating side effects. The single most debilitating side effect was oropharyngeal mucositis that was characterized by patients as sore throat, and mouth sores and pain; both negatively affected the patient's ability to eat and drink, causing many patients to experience significant weight loss.

Hippocampal dependent cognitive impairments were quantified with the Morris water maze and showed that DFMO effectively reversed cognitive impairments after all injuries, particularly traumatic brain injury. Similar results were seen with respect to the expression of Arc protein, but not neurogenesis. Given that polyamines have been found to modulate inflammatory responses in the brain we also assessed the numbers of total and newly born activated microglia, and found reduced numbers of newly born cells. While the mechanisms responsible for the improvement in cognition after DFMO treatment are not yet clear, the present study provides new and compelling data regarding the potential use of DFMO as a potential countermeasure against the adverse effects of single or combined injury.",Excluded,0.98121864

3675,"In search of dental anesthesia Background: It has been well established that Laser Therapy irradiation can give analgesia by affecting the conduction of the C fibers, the nerve fibers that carry pain impulses from the dental pulp to the brain. Currently, laser irradiation with an infrared (830 nm) wavelength for analgesia is being used very successfully in a number of dental procedures. Study: Thus far, however, the effect of laser irradiation has been limited to analgesia. Recently Dr. Roberta Chow has reported a great deal of success by utilizing the visible red wavelength in the peripheral nerves. Preliminary results have indicated there is great analgesia being obtained, and in some cases, it hs been thought that anesthesia has been achieved. However, in dentistry, the nerves being irradiated are cranial nerves, which may react differently from peripheral nerves. Result(s): This presentation will outline a number of cases in which dental analgesia has been successfully used for conditions such as restorative procedures and crown preparation. In addition, the preliminary results of the clinical study investigating the use of visible red laser irradiation in a variety of dental cases will be presented.

3677,"[Treatment of vesico-enteric fistulae in men. Pedicled bladder flap] Genitourinary fistulae represent a rare condition for patients submitted to salvage radiotherapy due to local tumour relapse after radical prostatectomy. Nevertheless, it is associated with great morbidity and in many cases with repetitive surgeries limiting their quality of life. Many techniques have been proposed to reduce the incidence of early and late postsurgical complications, but up to now a safe and unique method to treat this disease has not been reported in the literature. Here we report on three cases of male patients who developed a vesicoenteric fistula after radiation salvage therapy following radical prostatectomy. A rotation bladder flap was used to cover the pelvic floor attempting to reduce the common complications. All of the patients underwent a urinary diversion and a protective colostomy. The 1-year follow-up showed good postsurgical outcomes with minor early complications and no signs of intestinal obstruction or recurrent fistula. Furthermore, perineal and pelvic pain improvement was also achieved. The small number of cases is a limiting factor in defining standard techniques for the treatment of actinic vesicoenteric fistulae. Nevertheless, the use of a rotational bladder flap for repair of the pelvic floor defect has shown promising results and should be indicated in special situations.",Excluded,0.085721515

3679,"Seizure suppression by EEG-guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the rat OBJECTIVE: To test the anticonvulsive potential of a range of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequencies by novel methods for simultaneous EEG and rTMS in a rat seizure model.METHODS: Seizures were triggered by intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA; 10mg/kg). Rats (n=21) were divided into three groups in which individual seizures were treated with rTMS trains at one of three frequencies: 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 Hz. EEG was continuously viewed by an operator who identified each seizure onset. Consecutive seizures in each animal were (1) treated with active rTMS, (2) treated with sham rTMS, or (3) were untreated. EEG was re-analyzed post hoc by visual inspection, and seizure durations were compared within and between treatment groups.RESULTS: KA-induced seizures were abbreviated by 0.75 Hz (P=0.019) and 0.5 Hz (P=0.033) active EEG-guided rTMS. In contrast, neither active 0.25 Hz rTMS nor the control conditions affected seizure duration (P>0.2).CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that EEG-guided rTMS can suppress seizures in the rat KA epilepsy model, and that the effect is frequency dependent, with 0.75 and 0.5 Hz rTMS being superior to 0.25 Hz rTMS.SIGNIFICANCE: These data support the use of rat seizure models in translational research aimed at evaluation and development of effective rTMS anticonvulsive protocols.

3681,"The ATM gene and protein: possible roles in genome surveillance, checkpoint controls and cellular defence against oxidative stress The autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is highly pleiotropic. It is characterized by gradual loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, leading to progressive neuromotor deterioration, immunodeficiency, developmental defects in specific tissues, profound predisposition to malignancy and acute sensitivity to ionizing radiation. AT cells show chromosomal instability, premature senesence, radiosensitivity and defects in cell cycle checkpoints activated by ionizing radiation. Several radiation induced pathways that regulate the cell cycle seem to be defective in AT cells, at least one of which is mediated by TP53. Extensive characterization of the cellular defects of AT cells, together with the recent isolation of the ATM gene, has provided some insight into the possible physiological roles of the ATM protein. Several lines of evidence, including the nature of the agents that elicit the hypersensitivity of AT cells, point to the possibility of a defect in the response to damage induced by oxidative stress, which affects various cellular macromolecules. The ATM protein might have a role in activating defence mechanisms against oxidative stress. This hypothesis broadens the previous concept of the AT defect and explains several aspects of the AT phenotype that cannot be accounted for by defective processing of DNA damage.

Aim(s): To develop evidence-based guidelines for CT simulation appointment length to increase capacity and improve access to radiotherapy clinical resources. Method(s): Phase 1 was a retrospective chart review of 60 patients selected in reverse chronological order from the CT simulation schedule for the following radiotherapy techniques: Breast tangent, CNS (brain and spine) IMRT and SBRT, Lung (including mesothelioma) IMRT and SBRT, Liver IMRT, Upper GI IMRT, Lymphoma mantle and Total Body Irradiation (TBI), and Head and Neck (H&N) IMRT. The duration of the CT simulation procedure was measured for each patient as the difference between the first and last time stamps in the radiation therapy electronic medical record. In Phase 2 an additional 5 minutes was added to each appointment length in Phase 1 to account for routine patient care activities (e.g. patient education) extending beyond the documented time stamps. Evidence-based appointment lengths for each technique were averaged, peer reviewed, and validated by CT simulation radiation therapist specialists. Current appointment lengths were matched to the evidence-based appointment lengths. Result(s): Liver, Lymphoma TBI, CNS spine SBRT, Lung SBRT and Mesothelioma evidence-based appointment lengths (45 min) were 25% less than current appointment lengths (60 min). Breast, CNS brain, Lung, Upper GI and H&N evidence-based appointment lengths (20 min) were 33% less than current appointment lengths (30 min). Implementation of the evidencebased appointment lengths at an academic cancer centre with 4 CT simulators resulted in an overall net gain of 2880 minutes (equivalent to 96 30 minute appointments) of CT simulation time per month.

Current guidelines recommend 5-hydroxytryptamine<inf>3</inf> receptor antagonists (5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs) for prophylaxis of RINV for moderate and highly emetogenic radiotherapy; however, certain patients may suffer from RINV despite prophylaxis. Objective(s): To determine if switching 5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs is successful in the treatment and further prophylaxis of RINV. Method(s): This report details the case of a 47-year-old female with extensive bony involvement to the spine from breast cancer presenting with lower back pain. To palliate her symptoms, the patient underwent a course of irradiation to the lumbar spine and was prescribed ondansetron as an antiemetic. However, the patient experienced severe nausea and emesis and was subsequently switched to granisetron and aprepitant. Result(s): The patient completed the remainder of the radiation treatment with no further emesis and minimal nausea, representing the first documented success of granisetron and aprepitant for RINV after failure on ondansetron. Conclusion(s): In chemotherapy, switching 5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs after failure on the first is successful in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), yet this has not been previously observed in radiation.

3688,"Acute impairment of saccadic eye movement is associated with cerebral infarction after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage Introduction Cerebral infarction due to delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Damage to the brain in the first 72 hours (""early brain injury"") is likely to play a key pathophysiological role but remains difficult to quantify objectively and noninvasively at the bedside-especially in those patients who do not require sedation or ventilation. Current diagnostic modalities used in routine clinical practice are either invasive, require ionising radiation or contrast or have a high learning curve and user variability. Objectives We sought to determine whether saccadic eye movements are impaired following SAH and whether measurement of saccadic latency (SL) in the acute period post-aneurysm rupture is associated with the likelihood of developing DCI in patients after SAH. Methods 24 male/female patients (mean age 53.32, range 31-70) with World Federation of Neurosurgeons (WFNS) grade I and II aneurysmal SAH, treated endovascularly within 72 hours of rupture were recruited. DCI and DCI-related cerebral infarction were defined as per consensus guidelines.1 Saccadometry data was collected at three time points: In the first 72 hours, between days 5 and 10 and at three months post-SAH. Data from 10 healthy age/gender matched controls was collected on one occasion for comparison. Results Age-adjusted median SL in patients was significantly prolonged in the first 72 hours post-SAH when compared to controls (188.7, 95 % CI = (176.9, 202.2)ms v 160.7, 95 % CI = (145.6, 179.4)ms, p = 0.0054 f-test). By 3 months post-SAH, there was no significant difference in median SL compared to controls (188.7, 95 % CI = (176.9, 202.2)ms v 180.0, 95 % CI = (165.1, 197.8)ms, p = 0.4175 f-test). Patients diagnosed with cerebral infarction due to DCI had a significantly higher age-adjusted median SL in the first 72 hours than those without infarction (240.6, 95 % CI = (216.7, 270.3)ms v 204.1, 95 % CI = (190.7, 219.5)ms, p = 0.0157 t-test). This difference was more pronounced during days 5-10 post-SAH-the peak incidence for DCI (303.7, 95 % CI = (266.7 352.7)ms v 207.6, 95 % CI = (193.7, 223.6)ms, p < 0.0001 t-test). A binary generalised linear model showed that median SL in the first 72 hours was the only significant predictor of cerebral infarction after SAH. Conclusions This is the first study to use saccadometry to measure eye movements in patients with SAH during the acute period post-rupture. Results show that median saccadic latency in the first 72 hours following SAH is an independent predictor of the risk of developing cerebral infarction due to DCI. Saccadometry may act as a potential objective biomarker of early brain injury to guide the need for intensive care admission and treatment. [Table Presented].",Excluded,0.14327255
3689,"All-optical switching in plant blue light photoreceptor phototropin We theoretically analyze all-optical switching in the recently characterized LOV2 domain from Avena sativa (oat) phot1 phototropin, a blue-light plant photoreceptor, based on nonlinear intensity-induced excited-state absorption. The transmission of a cw probe laser beam at 660 nm corresponding to the peak absorption of the first excited L-state, through the LOV2 sample, is switched by a pulsed pump laser beam at 442 nm that corresponds to the maximum initial D state absorption. The switching characteristics have been analyzed using the rate equation approach, considering all the three intermediate states and transitions in the LOV2 photocycle. It is shown that for a given pump pulse intensity, there is an optimum pump pulsewidth for which the switching contrast is maximum. It is shown that the probe laser beam can be completely switched off (100% modulation) by the pump laser beam at 50 kW/cm2 for a concentration of 1 mM with sample thickness of 5.5 mm. The switching characteristics are sensitive to various parameters such as concentration, rate constant of L-state, peak pump intensity and pump pulse width.

OBJECTIVES: Many neurosurgeons obtain repeat head CT at the first clinic follow-up visit for nonoperative cerebral contusion and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH). The authors undertook a single-center, retrospective study to determine whether outpatient CT altered clinical decision-making.METHODS: The authors evaluated 173 consecutive adult patients admitted to their institution from April 2006 to August 2012 with an admission diagnosis of cerebral contusion or tSAH and at least 1 clinic follow-up visit with CT. Patients with epidural, subdural, aneurysmal subarachnoid, or intraventricular hemorrhage, and those who underwent craniotomy, were excluded. Patient charts were reviewed for new CT findings, new patient symptoms, and changes in treatment plan. Patients were stratified by neurological symptoms into 3 groups: 1) asymptomatic; 2) mild, nonspecific symptoms; and 3) significant symptoms. Mild, nonspecific symptoms included minor headaches, vertigo, fatigue, and mild difficulties with concentration, short-term memory, or sleep; significant symptoms included moderate to severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, focal neurological complaints, impaired consciousness, or new cognitive impairment evident on routine clinical examination.RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three patients met inclusion criteria, with initial clinic follow-up obtained within approximately 6 weeks. Of the 173 patients, 104 (60.1%) were asymptomatic, 68 patients (39.3%) had mild, nonspecific neurological symptoms, and 1 patient (1.0%) had significant neurological symptoms. Of the asymptomatic patients, 3 patients (2.9%) had new CT findings and 1 of these patients (1.0%) underwent a change in treatment plan because of these findings. This change involved an additional clinic appointment and CT to monitor a 12-mm chronic subdural hematoma that ultimately resolved without treatment. Of the patients with mild, nonspecific neurological symptoms, 6 patients (8.8%) had new CT findings and 3 of these patients (4.4%) underwent a change in treatment plan because of these findings; none of these patients required surgical intervention. The single patient with significant neurological symptoms did not have any new CT findings.CONCLUSIONS: Repeat outpatient CT of asymptomatic patients after nonoperative cerebral contusion and tSAH is very unlikely to demonstrate significant new pathology.

This study was performed to explore its role in visual processing.METHODS: PKCalpha-knockout (Prkca(-/-)) mice and control animals were examined by using electroretinography (ERG), light microscopy, and immunocytochemistry.RESULTS: The Prkca(-/-) mice showed no signs of retinal degeneration up to 12 months of age, but ERG measurements indicated a decelerated increase in the ascending limb of the scotopic (rod-sensitive) b-wave as well as a delayed return to baseline. These results suggest that PKCalpha is an important modulator that affects bipolar cell signal transduction and termination. Confocal microscopy of retinal sections showed that PKCalpha co-localized with calbindin, which indicates a PKCalpha localization in close proximity to the horizontal cell terminals. In addition, the implicit time of the ERG c-wave originating from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the recovery of photoreceptors from bleaching conditions were substantially faster in the knockout mice than in the wild-type control animals.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PKCalpha is a modulator of rod-bipolar cell function by accelerating glutamate-driven signal transduction and termination.

3702,"Dual role of MRK in glioblastoma invasion and radio-resistance Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive tumor of the central nervous system, has poor prognosis both because of diffuse infiltration of tumor cells in the normal parenchyma and resistance to radiation treatment and chemotherapy. We found that MRK, a stress-activated MAP3K protein kinase, is overexpressed in GBM compared with normal brain tissue, evident in microarray expression data and confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. We have shown that MRK can be activated by at least two distinct signaling inputs: MRK kinase activity is stimulated by ionizing radiation (IR) downstream of NBS1 and ATM in a pathway that leads to activation of Chk2 and cell-cycle arrest. We also showed that downregulation of MRK by RNA interference sensitizes SNB19 and U87 GBM cells to IR. In addition, MRK functions as an effector of RhoC in a pathway that is initiated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a motogenic factor that is overproduced in GBM tumors. We also showed that MRK depletion impairs LPA-stimulated invasion in GBM cells. To examine the role of MRK in GBM in vivo, we used an orthotopic xenograft model. Human GBM explant cells (GBM6) were maintained in nude mice as flank tumors, transduced in vitro with lentiviruses expressing control or MRK shRNA, and subsequently implanted into the brains of nude mice. Control mice had a median survival of 47 days, whereas downregulation of MRK increased survival by 14 days. In a parallel experiment, mice were treated with 20-Gy radiation in 10 fractions over 5 days.

Ninety-one patients received PCI (30 Gy/15 or 25 Gy/10) and 64 patients did not receive PCI. Survival was compared in a landmark analysis that included only patients who had stable disease or better in response to primary therapy.RESULTS: Patients who received PCI had better survival than patients who did not receive PCI (median survival 12.0 months vs. 7.6 months, 3-year overall survival 13.2% vs. 3.1%, HR = 0.53 [95% CI 0.36-0.78], p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, the only factor that remained significant for survival was stage (ESCLC vs. LSCLC, p = 0.0072). In contrast, the multivariate analysis of patients who had ESCLC revealed that PCI was the sole factor associated with a survival advantage (HR = 0.47 [95% CI 0.24-0.93], p = 0.03). Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were significantly greater in patients who received PCI (71.4% vs. 47.5%, p = 0.0031), with non-neuro and non-heme being the specific AE categories most strongly correlated with PCI delivery.CONCLUSIONS: PCI was associated with a significant improvement in survival for our entire elderly SCLC patient cohort on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis suggested that the survival advantage remained significant in patients with ESCLC. PCI was also associated with a modest increase in grade 3 or higher AEs.",Included,0.9832476
3705,"Tactile situation awareness system: proprioceptive prostheses for sensory deficiencies UNLABELLED: Pilots and astronauts do not experience spatial disorientation in normal day-to-day terrestrial activities. On the ground, the perception of position and motion is determined by central nervous system integration of concordant and redundant information from multiple sensory channels (somatosensory, vestibular and visual) which collectively yield veridical perceptions. In the acceleration environments experienced by pilots and astronauts, the somatosensory and vestibular senses frequently present false but concordant information concerning the direction of gravity or down. When presented with conflicting sensory stimuli, it is normal for pilots and astronauts to experience episodes of disorientation. Visual instruments and displays developed over the past 70 yr have not solved the problem. A simple solution to maintain spatial orientation is to provide true information using the same sensory channels we use so successfully on Earth.METHODS: The Tactile Situation Awareness System (TSAS) developed by NASA and the U.S. Navy uses a matrix of mechanical tactile stimulators (tactors) applied on the torso and limbs to convey orientation cues (e.g., gravity vector) in an intuitive fashion to the skin. A series of in-flight experiments to validate and test a variety of tactile displays and concepts has been carried out in both helicopters and fixed wing aircraft.RESULTS: Pilots were able to fly complex maneuvers with no instruments or outside visual references (blindfolded) with less than 20 min of training. Recovery from unusual attitudes solely by tactile cues was trivial. Lab tests have shown the TSAS improves performance under conditions of high workload.CONCLUSIONS: When orientation information is presented via intuitive tactile displays spatial orientation is easily maintained in altered sensory conditions including unusual acceleration environments.",Excluded,0.085737236

3707,"DELTApH, H<sup>+</sup> diffusion potentials, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATPase in neurosecretory vesicles isolated from bovine neurohypophyses The proton gradient (DELTApH) and electrical potential (DELTApsi) across the neurosecretory vesicles were measured using the optical probes 9-aminoacridine and Oxanol VI, respectively. The addition of neurosecretory vesicles to 9-aminoacridine resulted in a rapid quenching of the dye fluorescence which was reversed when the DELTApH was collapsed with ammonium chloride or K<sup>+</sup> in the presence of nigericin. From fluorescence quenching data and the intravesicular volume, DELTApH across the membrane was calculated. Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATP caused a marked carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-sensitive change in the membrane potential measured using Oxanol VI (plus 100 mV inside positive), presumably due to H<sup>+</sup> translocation across the neurosecretory vesicle membrane. Imposition of this membrane potential was responsible for the lysis of vesicles in the presence of permeant anions. The effectiveness of these anions to support lysis reflected the relative permeability of the anion which followed the order acetate > I<sup>-</sup> > Cl > F<sup>-</sup> > SO<inf>4</inf><sup>-</sup> = isethionate = methyl sulfate. These data showed that the neurosecretory vesicles possess a membrane H<sup>+</sup>-translocating system and prompted the study of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ATPase activities in the vesicle fractions. In intact vesicles a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATPase appeared to be coupled to electrogenic proton translocation, since the enzyme activity was enhanced by uncoupling the electrical potential, using proton ionophores. Inhibition of this enzyme with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide also inhibited the carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-sensitive DELTApsi across the vesicle membrane caused by H<sup>+</sup> translocation. A second Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATPase was also found on the vesicle membranes which is sensitive to vanadate. Complete inhibition of this enzyme with vanadate had little effect on the proton ionophore-uncoupled ATPase activity or on the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATP-induced membrane potential change.",Excluded,0.086279914
3708,"Small-cell lung cancer: Clinical management and unmet needs new perspectives for an old problem Small cell lung cancer is a highly aggressive, difficult to treat neoplasm. Among all lung tumors, small cell lung cancers account for about 20%. Patients typically include heavy smokers in 70s age group, presenting with symptoms such as intrathoracic tumors growth, distant spread or paraneoplastic syndromes at the time of diagnosis. A useful and functional classification divides small cell lung cancers into limited disease and extensive disease. Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy is the standard treatment for limited disease, with improved survival when combined with prophylactic cranial irradiation. Platinum compounds (cisplatin/carboplatin) plus etoposide remain the cornerstone for extensive disease. Nevertheless, despite high chemoand radio-sensitivity of this cancer, nearly all patients relapse within the first two years and the prognosis is extremely poor. A deeper understanding about small cell lung cancer carcinogenesis led to develop and test a considerable number of new and targeted agents but the results are currently weak or insufficient. To date, small cell lung cancer is still a challenge for researchers. In this review, key aspects of small cell lung cancer management and controversial points of standard and new treatments will be discussed.

3710,"Presynaptic serotonergic modulation of 5-HT and acetylcholine release in the hippocampus and the cortex of 5-HT1B-receptor knockout mice Lesioning of serotonergic afferents increases hippocampal ACh release and attenuates memory deficits produced by cholinergic lesions. Improved memory performance described in 5-HT1B-knockout (KO) mice might thus be due to a weaker 5-HT1B-mediated inhibitory influence of 5-HT on hippocampal ACh release. The selective delay-dependent impairment of working memory observed in these KO mice suggests, however, that cortical regions also participate in task performance, possibly via indirect influences of 5-HT on ACh release. To provide neuropharmacological support for these hypotheses we measured evoked ACh and 5-HT release in hippocampal and cortical slices of wild-type (WT) and 5-HT1B KO mice. Superfused slices (preincubated with [3H]choline or [3H]5-HT) were electrically stimulated in the absence or presence of 5-HT1B receptor ligands. In hippocampus and cortex, 5-HT1B agonists decreased and antagonists increased 5-HT release in WT, but not in 5-HT1B KO mice. In 5-HT1B KO mice, 5-HT release was enhanced in both structures, while ACh release (in nCi) was reduced. ACh release was inhibited by 5-HT1B agonists in hippocampal (not cortical) slices of WT but not of 5-HT1B KO mice. Our data (i) confirm the absence of autoinhibition of 5-HT release in 5-HT1B-KO mice, (ii) demonstrate a reduced release of ACh, and the absence of 5-HT1B-receptor-mediated inhibition of ACh release, in the hippocampus and cortex of 5-HT1B-KO mice, and (iii) are compatible with an indirect role of cortical ACh in the working memory impairment observed in these KO mice.",Excluded,0.09270228
3711,"Presynaptic modulation of 5-HT release in the rat septal region 5-HT released from serotonergic axon terminals in the septal nuclei modulates the activity of septal output neurons (e.g. septohippocampal cholinergic neurons) bearing somatodendritic 5-HT receptors. Therefore, we studied the mechanisms involved in the presynaptic modulation of 5-HT release in the lateral (LS) and medial septum (MS), and the diagonal band of Broca (DB). HPLC analysis showed that tissue concentrations of noradrenaline, dopamine and 5-HT were highest in DB (DB>MS>LS). Slices prepared from LS, MS and DB regions were preincubated with [(3)H]5-HT, superfused in the presence of 6-nitro-2-(1-piperazinyl)-quinoline (6-nitroquipazine) and electrically stimulated up to three times (first electrical stimulation period (S(1)), S(2), S(3); 360 pulses, 3 Hz, 2 ms, 26-28 mA). In all septal regions the Ca(2+)-dependent and tetrodotoxin-sensitive electrically-evoked overflow of [(3)H] was inhibited by the 5-HT(1B) agonist CP-93,129 and the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist 5-bromo-6-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)-quinoxaline tartrate (UK-14,304). Also the mu- and kappa-opioid receptor agonists (d-Ala(2), N-Me-Phe(4), glycinol(5))-enkephalin (DAMGO) and [trans-(1S,2S(-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]-benzenacetamide hydro-chloride] (U-50,488H), respectively, acted inhibitory (although less potently), whereas the delta-opioid receptor agonist (d-Pen(2), d-Pen(5))-enkephalin (DPDPE), the dopamine D(2) receptor agonist quinpirole and the adenosine A(1) receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine were all ineffective; the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen had weak effects. All inhibitory effects of the agonists were antagonized by the corresponding antagonists (3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-4-hydroxy-N-[4-(4-pyridinyl)phenyl]benzamide dihydrochloride (GR-55,562), idazoxan, naloxone, nor-binaltorphimine), which also significantly enhanced the evoked release of 5-HT at S(1). It is concluded that 5-HT release in septal nuclei of the rat is modulated by presynaptic 5-HT(1B) autoreceptors, as well as by alpha(2)-, mu- and kappa-opioid heteroreceptors. All of these receptors seem to be under a tonic inhibitory influence of the corresponding endogenous agonists and show qualitatively comparable modulatory properties along the dorso-ventral distribution of the 5-HT terminals.",Excluded,0.086263165

Here, we delivered a single pulse of TMS (spTMS) to V5/MT during a motion direction discrimination task while concurrently manipulating the level of noise in the motion stimulus.

Pathologically it is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neuronal loss within the brain tissue of affected individuals. It is now widely hypothesised that fibrillar structures represent an inert structure. Biophysical and toxicity assays attempting to characterize the formation of both the fibrillar and the intermediate oligomeric structures of Abeta typically involves preparing samples which are largely monomeric; the most common method by which this is achieved is to use the fluorinated organic solvent 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP). Recent evidence has suggested that this method is not 100% effective in producing an aggregate free solution. We show, using dynamic light scattering, size exclusion chromatography and small angle X-ray scattering that this is indeed the case, with HFIP pretreated Abeta peptide solutions displaying an increased proportion of oligomeric and aggregated material and an increased propensity to aggregate. Furthermore we show that an alternative technique, involving treatment with strong alkali results in a much more homogenous solution that is largely monomeric. These techniques for solubilising and controlling the oligomeric state of Abeta are valuable starting points for future biophysical and toxicity assays. Â© 2013 Ryan et al.",Excluded,0.086387485

Patients were examined with (11)C-L-methionine PET and MRI prior to treatment and after 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years. Temporal changes in methionine uptake ratio, meningioma volume, meningioma regrowth and clinical symptoms throughout the follow-up period were evaluated.RESULTS: In 17 patients the tumour volume was unchanged throughout the follow-up. The methionine uptake ratio on PET decreased over the years in most patients. In two patients the tumour remnant showed progression on MRI. In these patients, prior to the volume increase on MRI, the methionine uptake ratio increased. One patient experienced transient clinical symptoms and showed radiological evidence of a radiation-induced reaction close to the irradiated field.CONCLUSION: Proton beam treatment is a safe and effective treatment for achieving long-term growth arrest in meningioma remnants.

Seeds were counted on radiographs from CT simulation, first treatment and last treatment. Retention and use of at least three markers for kV/kV matching was considered a successful implant. A visual analogue scale (VAS) pain assessment was performed. SAS was used for data analysis.RESULTS: Fiducial marker placement was successful for kV/kV matching in 556/581 patients (95.7%). The procedure was aborted due to pain in two patients. Additional sedation during the procedure was required in two patients. Complications include urinary infections (2 patients, <0.5%) and transient haematuria (2 patients, <0.5%). There were no recorded calls requesting additional pain medication or delays in radiation due to complications. The number of seeds identified at simulation: 4 (2 patients), 3 (554 patients), 2 (21 patients), 1 (1 patient), 0 (1 patient). One patient with three seeds and two patients with <2 seeds had cone beam CT instead of kV/kV imaging for image guidance. No seeds were lost after simulation.

BACKGROUND: Stem cell transplantation (SCT) into the neuraxis is being investigated as a potential therapy for a variety of neurologic conditions. However, studies to date have not demonstrated definitive benefit and reports have highlighted risks such as malignancy. Despite this, increasing numbers of individuals with neurologic disease are lured to international centers providing unregulated stem cell therapies, an industry termed ""stem cell tourism."" DESIGN: case report CASE: A 66-year-old man underwent multiple commercial infusions of stem cells (allogeneic, embryonic neural, and mesenchymal) at various sites around the world to treat deficits from an ischemic stroke. He subsequently developed progressive lower back pain, paraplegia, and urinary incontinence. MRI of the spine demonstrated an enhancing, intradural, extramedullary mass from T10 to the distal thecal sac encasing the cauda equina nerve roots and conus medullaris. RESULT(S): Histopathologic evaluation of biopsied tissue from T10 revealed two populations of cells: primitive-appearing atypical cells (~50[percnt] expressing SOX2; neural marker) and glial differentiated cells with vascular proliferation. Both populations demonstrated negative embryonic stem cell markers (OCT3/4) and leukocyte markers (CD45). Short tandem repeat molecular analysis showed 62 +/- 8 [percnt] of cells contained non-host DNA, most likely derived from one non-patient human. Oncopanel targeted exome DNA sequencing showed no pathogenic mutations. Radiation was administered with 48.6 Gy/27 fractions from C4 to thecal sac, delivered in 3 shrinking field doses.

3719,"Correlation between fissured fibrous cap and contrast enhancement: preliminary results with the use of CTA and histologic validation BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies demonstrated that carotid plaques analyzed by CTA can show contrast plaque enhancement. The purpose of this preliminary work was to evaluate the possible association between the fissured fibrous cap and contrast plaque enhancement.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven consecutive (men = 25; average age = 66.8 +/- 9 years) symptomatic patients studied by use of a multidetector row CT scanner were prospectively analyzed. CTA was performed before and after contrast and radiation doses were recorded; analysis of contrast plaque enhancement was performed. Patients underwent carotid endarterectomy en bloc; histologic sections were prepared and evaluated for fissured fibrous cap and microvessel attenuation. The Mann-Whitney test was performed to evaluate the differences between the 2 groups. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of fissured fibrous cap and microvessel attenuation on contrast plaque enhancement. Receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were also calculated.RESULTS: Twelve patients had fissured fibrous cap. In 92% (11/12) of fissured fibrous cap-positive plaques, we found contrast plaque enhancement, whereas in 69% (24/35) of the plaques without fissured fibrous cap contrast plaque enhancement was found. The Mann-Whitney test showed a statistically significant difference between the contrast enhancement in plaques with fissured fibrous cap (Hounsfield units = 22.6) and without fissured fibrous cap (Hounsfield units = 12.9) (P = .011). On the regression analysis, both fissured fibrous cap and neovascularization were associated with contrast plaque enhancement (P = .0366 and P = .0001). The receiver operating characteristic curve confirmed an association between fissured fibrous cap and contrast plaque enhancement with an area under the curve of 0.749 (P = .005).CONCLUSIONS: The presence of fissured fibrous cap is associated with contrast plaque enhancement.

3720,"Prevalence of abnormal brain CT scan finding in patients with headache: Two year study in Imam Hospital. [Arabic] Background: Headache is one of the most common problems that bring patients to doctors' offices. Many physicians order neuroimaging studies after taking the history of the patient and performing a physical examination. These neuroimaging studies are often requested due to the probable existence of an intracranial lesion. However, at times they are requested to allay the fears of patients or even doctors. Most of these studies are normal and the question arises whether there is any indication for requesting neuroimaging studies for a patient with an isolated headache. Method(s): We studied 146 patients with headache who had been referred for CT scan to the imaging center of Imam Khomeini Hospital during 2004-2005. For each patient, a questionnaire, including the medical history and accompanying neurological symptoms, was filled out and CT scan results were gathered. Result(s): The mean of age of the patients was 37.8 years, and 69% were female. Only 10 patients (6.8%) had a brain lesion in the CT scan. Accompanying neurological symptoms were more frequent in patients with abnormal rather than normal CT scans. There was a meaningful correlation between abnormal CT scan and paresthesia, ptosis, paresia, diplopia, visual loss, convulsion, vomiting and vertigo. A statistical correlation existed between gender and positive CT scan. Conclusion(s): Many patients with headache have normal brain CT scan results. Thus, better criteria are warranted for requesting neuroimaging including accurate patient history and neurological examination in order to prevent unnecessary radiation exposure.

Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance allow only an approximate estimation of the GFR. The aim of this study was an accurate assessment of long -term changes in GFR using the 99mTc-DTPA clearance. Of particular interest was the impact of pre-existing risk factors. Methods : GFR of 75 patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET) treated with <sup>177</sup>Lu-octreotate (4 intended cycles at 3 monthly intervals and mean activity of 7.9 GBq per cycle) were retrospectively analyzed. A minimum follow-up of 12 months was required for patient inclusion. Mean followup duration was 20 months (range 12-48 months), with a median of 5 GFR measurements per patient. The change of GFR was analyzed by linear curve fit. Potential risk factors including DM, HTN, previous chemotherapy and decreased renal function at baseline were analyzed regarding impact on the renal function loss. Comparability of nephrotoxicity determined by 99mTc-DTPA clearance and serum creatinine (using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0) was also investigated. Results : A reduction of >2 ml / year in GFR was observed in 31 (42%) and > 10ml/year in 16 patients (22%). The mean and median decline in GFR was 12 and 7 ml per year respectively. However, only one patient developed serious nephrotoxicity (CTCAE grade III). Eleven patients showed an increase of > 10 ml/year in GFR following PRRT. Nephrotoxicity graded according to serum creatinine (CTCAE) was not compatible with GFR in 17% of the assessments and was underestimated by serum creatinine in 12% of patients. None of the investigated risk factors contributed to a reduction in GFR. Conclusions : Severe nephrotoxicity after PRRT with <sup>177</sup>Lu-octrotate is rare (1.3 % of patients).

Tissues highly absorb and scatter the light in near infrared spectrum, where the laser provides therapeutic effects. Novel frontiers of clinical practice, e.g., the employment of laser light for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, require information about pancreas-laser interaction, which are crucial for therapy management. The property of biological tissues to scatter the light traveling through is described by the anisotropy coefficient (g). The relationship between g and the angular distribution of the scattered light is described by Henyey-Greenstein phase function. The measurement of angular distribution of scattered light is performed by the goniometric technique. This paper describes the estimation of g of ex vivo pancreas at 1064 nm, performed by a goniometric-based system, where a photodetector measures intensities of scattered light at fixed angles between -120degree and 120degree. A two-term Henyey-Greenstein phase function has been employed to estimate anisotropy coefficient for forward (gfs) and backward scattering (gbs). Experimental trails were performed to assess the repeatability of measurement system: percentage value of standard deviation is generally lower than 8% for angles higher (lower) than 13degree (13degree). Measurements were performed for the first time on healthy swine pancreas, aiming to investigate the influence of coagulation temperature: gfs decreases from 0.94 (at 25 degreeC) to 0.93 (at 80 degreeC).

Apart from pain-related traits HA mice also manifest, as compared to the LA line, higher emotionality in various behavioural tests, and cope worse with the hypothermic challenge of swimming in cold water. In the present study HA mice appeared more susceptible to the mutagenic effect of whole-body gamma-radiation and mitomycin-C injection. Both treatments caused higher frequencies of chromosomal aberrations and micronucleus in bone marrow cells in the HA than in the LA line. The results are discussed in terms of a genetic correlation between animals' susceptibility to environmental stressors and the mechanism of mutagenesis. As shown by our recent molecular study, the selection for magnitude of swim analgesia has differentiated the parental outbred population into two distinct genotypes characterised by specific minisatellite and microsatellite sequences for each line, which may be genetic markers of particular traits.

Patients diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 2 were excluded. The patients underwent microsurgery and/or radiosurgery treatment.RESULTS: Trigeminal and jugular foramen schwannomas were the most common NVCNS tumors (n = 47), and the only two groups with sufficient numbers of patients to allow comparison of the three treatment approaches. In these two groups, the mean tumor volume was significantly higher in those who received combined therapy (8.59 +/- 2.29 cc), compared with radiosurgery (4.94 +/- 3.02 cc; p = 0.05) or microsurgery alone (5.38 +/- 3.23; p = 0.027). Patients who underwent radiosurgery alone were significantly older (67.7 +/- 13.3 years; p = 0.019) than those treated with microsurgery (55.3 +/- 13.7 years) or with both modalities (48.7 +/- 12.8 years). The Karnofsky Performance Scale scores were significantly higher (p < or = 0.05) at follow-up compared with baseline for all three treatment approaches. There was no significant change in the Glasgow Outcome scores before and after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgery and radiosurgery can both be used to manage NVCNS tumors with excellent results.

3728,"Treatment for older diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with cognitive impairment and dementia Background: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults, is often diagnosed between ages 60 and 70 years old. The population of older adults in the United States is projected to undergo rapid growth and increased life expectancy over the coming decades; thus, cancer cases among older adults will jointly be expected to increase. Comorbid conditions, such as cognitive impairment or dementia (CID), will also be more likely to be present at diagnosis of cancer in older adults and affect both treatment decision-making and prognosis. Few studies have evaluated treatment utilization patterns among older DLBCL patients with CID. Objective(s): Our objective was to describe treatment utilization patterns in older DLBCL patients with CID. Method(s): We performed a retrospective cohort study of 10 626 DLBCL patients ages 66 and older in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database, of whom 410 (3.9%) had CID prior to cancer diagnosis. Medicare beneficiaries with a first primary DLBCL diagnosis between 2001 and 2011 were identified. Validated algorithms utilizing administrative claims, diagnoses and procedures codes were used to identify CID and primary treatment with chemo-immunotherapy and radiation. The association between CID and receipt of treatment was determined using multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Result(s): Fewer patients with CID diagnoses received any DLBCL treatment (chemo-immunotherapy or radiation) compared with patients without CID (41% versus 65%). In multivariable models, patients with CID had significantly lower odds of any treatment (OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.38-0.59). These findings were consistent for treatment with chemo-immunotherapy (OR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.35-0.55) but not radiation (OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.59-1.06). In stratified analyses, patients aged 66-74 years (OR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.23-0.76) and Ann Arbor stage I-II (OR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.29-0.53) had the lowest odds of treatment. Conclusion(s): In summary, patients with CID were less likely to receive chemo-immunotherapy or radiation to treat DLBCL, and multiple factors could explain this less aggressive approach taken among these older patients. It remains unclear how CID and these differences in care influence survival. Further research on patient and caregiver preferences, treatment decision-making, and alternative treatment options for older patients with comorbid lymphoma and CID is warranted.",Excluded,0.8214891

3730,"Effects of optimization of injection dose on image quality and radiation exposure dose in FDG PET tests Objectives: The injection dose affects the image quality and radiation exposure dose in 1 8F-FDG PET tests. In this study, we optimized injection dose by adjusting it by patient's body weight and examined the effects of this optimization on image quality and exposure dose in FDG PET tests by analyzing a large number of actual patients' data using newly developed dose management software that complies with international standards. Method(s): The data of 1,771 patients were retrospectively analyzed using the dose management software, ontiTM (RYUKYU-ISG, Kyoto, Japan). The injection dose was fixed to 240 MBq for 846 patients and that was adjusted to 3.7 MBq/kg-body weight for 925 patients. Image quality was evaluated by noise equivalent countdensity (NECdensity) calculated excluding the counts of brain and bladder. Exposure dose was obtained using the rate of 0.019 mSv/MBq based on the report in ICRP publication 106. NECdensity and radiation exposure dose of the fixed and adjusted groups of patients were compared. Result(s): The optimization of injection dose changed the injection dose, NECdensity and radiation exposure dose from 239.9 +/- 6.83 MBq, 0.39 +/- 0.1 and 4.56 mSv to 213.0 +/- 39.9 MBq, 0.42 +/- 0.2 and 4.04 mSv, respectively. The adjustment of injection dose by body weight statistically significantly improved of image quality evaluated using NECdensity and radiation exposure dose by 8% and 11%, respectively (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): By analyzing a large number of patients' data using ontiTM, we demonstrated that the optimization of injection dose could contribute to the improvement of image quality and radiation exposure dose in 1 8F-FDG PET tests.",Excluded,0.08633963
3731,"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) presenting as solitary CNS lymphoma: A rare occurrence Introduction: PTLD associated lymphoma is the second most common malignancy in patients receiving SOT or HSCT with an incidence rate of 1%-3%. PCNS-PTLD occurs in 7%-15% of all PTLD cases. We present a case of isolated PCNS lymphoma two years after renal transplant. Case Description: A 57 year old woman with PMH of ESRD s/p kidney transplant (D/EBV -,R/ EBV +) with chronic CrCl of 30-40% presented with paresthesia and numbness over the right side of her body with mild ataxia 2 years post transplant. Physical exam revealed only numbness over the right side of body. MRI with contrast revealed a left thalamic lesion with moderate vasogenic edema, and MR spectroscopy confirmed high grade neoplasm involving left thalamus. Stereotactic biopsy showed polymorphic CD-20 and EBV positive PTLD. EBV PCR were elevated. Further evaluation ruled out systemic PTLD. Myfortic was stopped and oral steroids started with mild improvement in symptoms. Choice of systemic chemotherapy was limited due to reduced CrCl and risks of graft failure. She received modified regimen with renally adjusted high dose Methotrexate, Vincristine and Rituximab for 6 cycles with partial remission and then Temozolomide for 7 cycles with complete remission. Discussion(s): The incidence of PTLD ranges from 1 to 25% with 90% of cases being EBV-associated, CD20 positive, B cell neoplasms. PCNS-PTLD has a higher incidence in renal SOT, occurs late and is usually monomorphic unlike our patient. Median time of occurrence is 4-5 years after transplant. Risk factors include age, intensity of immunosuppression, time to transplant and EBV status of donor and recipient. Common presenting features include neurological deficits, seizure, and raised intracranial pressure. MRI is the preferred imaging and shows multifocal, ill defined, ring enhancing lesions usually in supratentorial and lobar regions. Positive CSF EBV PCR is highly suggestive but biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Treatment modalities include reduction of immunosuppression, rituximab, high dose methotrexate, cytarabine and cranial radiotherapy. Use of high dose methotrexate has shown improved outcomes with median survival of 26-47 months. Lack of response to first line therapy is considered the dominant prognostic factor.

3732,"An unusual natural history of metastatic basal cell carcinoma Introduction: Basal Cell carcinoma (BCC), unlike other skin malignancies, rarely metastasizes with an incidence rate ranging between 0.0028 and 0.55%. Less than 400 cases have been reported in the literature over the past 120 years.We present a rare case of BCC that had recurrent metastasis in the lung over a period of 17 years. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is an 89 year old male with a history of BCC of the forehead resected 17 years ago. Eight years later, he presented with solitary pulmonary nodule confirmed to be metastatic BCC. He underwent wedge resection of the right lower lobe followed by radiation due to local recurrence. He now presented with numbness of the right hand worsened by deep inspiration. The patient denied fever, cough, sputum production, hemoptysis, chest pain or shortness of breath. His other medical history included hypertension and COPD.Chest Xray showed right middle lobe infiltrate and elevated hemi diaphragm. CT scan of the chest without contrast demonstrated, right middle lobe pneumonia and a 2.5cm nodule in the left apex. He was treated with antibiotics and a subsequent CT chest with contrast confirmed only a spiculated mass in the left apex. CT scan of the abdomen, pelvis and brain was unremarkable.PET-CT scan showed a hypermetabolic 2.3cm apical nodule with irregular border and SUV of 12.6, suspicious for a primary lung neoplasm. He had a CT guided biopsy and frozen section demonstrated malignant cells. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the lesion to be a metastatic BCC, morphologically similar to the primary BCC diagnosed 17 years. DISCUSSION: BCC is usually a slow growing, locally destructive lesion with excellent prognosis. On the other hand, metastatic BCC is very aggressive and carries a poor prognosis. The median time for metastasis from onset of initial lesion is about 9 years.The size of the initial tumor and local recurrence appear to predict the likelihood of metastatic disease.The metastasis can be either regional (RM) or distant (DM). Lung is a common site for distant metastasis .The median survival with DM is 24 months in comparison to 87 months with RM. This particular patient however survived for more than 8 years since his metastatic disease was first diagnosed. Conclusion(s): Metastatic BCC is a rare entity. Although historically associated with a poor prognosis, the natural history of metastatic BCC might not be as grim as reported in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the longest surviving patient with metastatic BCC ever reported. More research is necessary to better characterize favorable factors in metastatic BCC and find out the sub-group of patients who would greatly benefit from aggressive therapy.",Excluded,0.088408984
3733,"COX-2 inhibitor as a radiation enhancer: New strategies for the treatment of lung cancer Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related mortality throughout the world, and the incidence continues to increase. Smoking is the number one cause of lung cancer. Emerging data have implicated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostanoid production in the pathogenesis of lung carcinoma. In invasive lung tumors, COX-2 upregulation has been reported in up to 90% of cases. COX-2 upregulation is an early event in the development of non-small-cell lung cancer and may be integral to the development of new blood vessels and production of specific proteases that are critical to growth and spread of lung malignancies. COX-2 inhibitors are known to enhance the chemosensitivity in COX-2 overexpressing lung cancer cell lines. Recently, we have demonstrated that selective COX-2 inhibitors also enhance the effect of radiation in COX-2 overexpressed cells. Therefore, inhibitors of COX-2 in combination with chemoradiation therapy may be an alternative strategy that can be tested in clinical trials. The combination of COX-2 inhibitors and radiation suggest a complementary strategy to target angiogenesis while potentially minimizing the impact on quality of life. Currently, several groups are conducting clinical trials in cervix cancer, lung cancer, and brain tumors, using inhibitors of COX-2 in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. These clinical trials will help to elucidate the role of this interesting class.",Excluded,0.0861586
3734,"Robotic stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy in meningiomas PURPOSE: Robotic stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy (SRT) become an important modality in the treatment of cranial meningiomas. In this study, we analysed the treatment parameters and outcomes of our cranial meningioma patients treated with SRT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013, 103 cranial meningioma lesions of 93 patients were treated with CyberKnife (Accurayw) Stereotactic Radiosurgery Unit. 42 patients (45%) received SRT as primary modality, and 51 patients ( 55 %) received postoperatively. Six patients have treated with external beam radiotherapy. Of the 103 cases, 69 of the lesions were located basally, 34 of them nonbasally. The most common symptoms in patients with basal tumours (38 patients, 58%) was detoriation in the visual field and the restriction of the eye movements and in patients with non-basal tumours (8 patients, 26%) was headache. In 33 patients (32%) tumours were located just adjacent to the optic apparatus or brain stem, 27 of them (26%) were located close (<1cm) to the optic apparatus or brain stem. SRT dose and fractionation were determined according to tumor localization. Optical apparatus and brainstem maximum point dose constraints for one fraction were 10 Gy and 14 Gy; 25 Gy and 30 Gy were for 5 fractions. RESULT(S): The median age was 44 (16-81). The female to male ratio was 73/20 (3.6/1). Median follow-up was 10 months (1-37 months). The median dose was 2500cGy (1500 - 3000 cGy). The median number of fraction was5 (1-5 fractions) fraction.GTVvolume ranged between 0.66cm3and 80.6 cm3 (Median 12.4 cm3). Median conformity index was 1.4 (1.06 to 2.03) and the median homogeneity index was 1.25 (1.09 to 1.56). Among the patients with follow up, local control rate was 98%. Only one patient with parasagittal meningioma underwent decompressive surgery due to radiation induced edema. All other side effects were either grade I or II. The most common side effect was headache associated with brain edema in 10 patients (11%).

The female rats were randomly divided into four groups. Group I; exposed to 3G modulated 2100MHz RFR signal for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 2 weeks, group II; control 10 days, were kept in an inactive exposure set-up for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 2 weeks, group III; exposed to 3G modulated 2100MHz RFR signal for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 8 weeks and group IV; control 40 days, were kept in an inactive exposure set-up for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 8 weeks. After the genomic DNA content of brain was extracted, oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine, pg/mL) and malondialdehyde (MDA, nmoL/g tissue) levels were determined. Our main finding was the increased oxidative DNA damage to brain after 10 days of exposure with the decreased oxidative DNA damage following 40 days of exposure compared to their control groups. Besides decreased lipid peroxidation end product, MDA, was observed after 40 days of exposure. The measured decreased quantities of damage during the 40 days of exposure could be the means of adapted and increased DNA repair mechanisms.",Excluded,0.08667231

3739,"Potassium currents in isolated statocyst neurons and RPeD1 in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis To begin to determine the underlying neural mechanisms of memory formation, we studied two different cell types that play important roles in different forms of associative learning in Lymnaea. Statocyst neurons (hair cells) mediate classical conditioning, whereas RPeD1 is a site of memory formation induced by operant conditioning of aerial respiration. Because potassium (K(+)) channels play a critical role in neuronal excitability, we initiated studies on these channels in the aforementioned neurons. Three distinct K(+) currents are expressed in the soma of both the hair cells and RPeD1. In hair cells and RPeD1, there is a fast activating and rapidly inactivating 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-sensitive A current (I(A)), a tetraethyl ammonium (TEA)-sensitive delayed rectifying current, which exhibits slow inactivation kinetics (I(KV)), and a TEA- and 4-AP-insensitive Ca(2+)-dependent current (I(Ca-K)). In hair cells, the activation voltage of I(A); its half-maximal steady-state activation voltage and its half-maximal steady-state inactivation were at more depolarized levels than in RPeD1. The time constant of recovery from I(A) inactivation was slightly faster in hair cells. I(A) in hair cells is also smaller in amplitude than in RPeD1 and is activated at more depolarized potentials.

3740,"Annual rate of hearing loss falls after fractionated stereotactic irradiation for vestibular schwannoma PURPOSE: The rate of hearing loss in a population before and after irradiation was investigated to determine the effect of irradiation on hearing impairment.METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 72 patients with vestibular schwannoma who received fractionated stereotactic irradiation from 1992 to 1999, 21 had had their hearing levels examined 3 months or more before the treatment. The mean time between the initial examination and treatment was 18.6 months (range: 3-89 months), and the mean time between treatment and the last follow-up was 24.2 months (12-69 months). Thirty-six to 50 Gy in 20-25 fractions over 5 to 6 weeks was given using an X-ray beam from a linear accelerator. Pure tone average (PTA) was measured using the mean hearing level at five frequencies, and the annual rate of hearing loss was defined as [(hearing loss in PTA(dB))/(follow-up period (months)x12)].RESULTS: The actual cumulative curve of decrease in tumor size of 2 mm or more was 38.3% at 2 years and 80.0% at 3 years. The mean of hearing loss in PTA was 11.6+/-10.3 dB (-1 to 35 dB) from the initial examination to the start of irradiation and 11.9+/-14.4 dB (-14 to 37 dB) from the start of irradiation to the last follow-up. The mean annual rates of hearing loss before irradiation and in the 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th years after irradiation were, respectively, 18.6, 11.2, 6.2, 5.1, and 5.0 dB/year. The annual rates of hearing loss in the 2nd year (P=0.025) and 3rd year (P=0.018) were significantly slower than the rate before irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: The mean annual rate of hearing loss was higher before irradiation than after irradiation, and hearing loss slowed rather than accelerated after irradiation. Although hearing loss after the treatment was usually permanent, fractionated stereotactic irradiation was suggested to be effective to lower the rate of hearing loss.",Excluded,0.98083055
3741,"Influence of backscatter radiation on cranial reconstruction implants Objective: We aimed to evaluate backscatter dose variations in different cranial bone implant materials in an experimental model designed to simulate postoperative radiotherapy. Method(s): We assessed the radiation backscatter doses associated with sheet- and mesh-type titanium plates and hydroxyapatite (HAP) samples (porosity: 35%, 50% and 85%). The samples were irradiated with 6- and 10-MV photon beams from a linear accelerator. Measurements were obtained using an ionization chamber and radiochromic films cut from the same batch. Result(s): At 6MV, the titanium sheet showed the highest peak for backscattered radiation, followed by (in decreasing order) HAP30%, HAP50%, titanium mesh and HAP85%. At 10MV, HAP30% showed the highest peak, followed by HAP50%, titanium sheet, titanium mesh and HAP85%. The peaks were at different depths in the titanium and HAP samples. The thickness of the human scalp is approximately 7mm; therefore, measurements were obtained 0-7mm above the implants to assess the likely dose on the scalp. A comparison of the maximum dose on the scalp showed the titanium sheet had the highest dose at both 6 and 10MV. Conclusion(s): The backscatter dose differed with the density of the material and the backscatter depth was different for each material. Advances in knowledge: Ulcer formation due to radiotherapy after brain tumour depends on not only radiation but also the implant material. Therefore, the density and type of implant material should be considered when planning radiotherapy and selecting bone reconstruction materials. Copyright Â© 2016 The Authors.

3742,"The distinctive cellular responses to DNA strand breaks caused by a DNA topoisomerase I poison in conjunction with DNA replication and RNA transcription Camptothecin (CPT) inhibits DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) through a non-catalytic mechanism that stabilizes the Top1-DNA cleavage complex (Top1cc) and blocks the DNA re-ligation step, resulting in the accumulation in the genome of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs), which are converted to secondary strand breaks when they collide with the DNA replication and RNA transcription machinery. DNA strand breaks mediated by replication, which have one DNA end, are distinct in repair from the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that have two ends and are caused by ionizing radiation and other agents. In contrast to two-ended DSBs, such one-ended DSBs are preferentially repaired through the homologous recombination pathway. Conversely, the repair of one-ended DSBs by the non-homologous end-joining pathway is harmful for cells and leads to cell death. The choice of repair pathway has a crucial impact on cell fate and influences the efficacy of anticancer drugs such as CPT derivatives. In addition to replication-mediated one-ended DSBs, transcription also generates DNA strand breaks upon collision with the Top1cc. Some reports suggest that transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks correlate with neurodegenerative diseases. However, the details of the repair mechanisms of, and cellular responses to, transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks still remain unclear. In this review, combining our recent results and those of previous reports, we introduce and discuss the responses to CPT-induced DNA damage mediated by DNA replication and RNA transcription.

3744,"Radiation induction of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene Ptk-3 in normal rat astrocytes Radiation-induced gene expression was examined in rat astrocyte cultures using differential display of mRNA via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. A 0.3-kb cDNA that was consistently observed in irradiated cultures but not in unirradiated cultures was cloned and sequenced. It was found to be identical to Ptk-3, a receptor tyrosine kinase gene identified recently. The protein encoded by Ptk-3 is a member of a novel class of receptor tyrosine kinases whose extracellular domain contains regions of homology with coagulation factors V and VIII and complement component C1. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of Ptk-3 was increased in rat astrocytes by 0.5 h after exposure to 10 Gy and remained at the same elevated level for at least 24 h. The maximum increase occurred after 5 Gy. Cloning studies indicated the presence of at least two Ptk-3 mRNA transcripts, which are probably the result of an alternative splicing mechanism. The short isoform lacks a 37-amino acid sequence in the glycine/proline-rich juxtamembrane region. The splicing pattern of the Ptk-3 gene was not altered by radiation.

The aim of the present study was to determine the stereological parameters of the brain areas involved in motion (motor cortex) and spatial learning - memory (hippocampus) under an HU condition. Sixteen adult male rats, kept under a 12: 12 h light-dark cycle, were divided into two groups of freely moving (n=8) and HU (n=8) rats. The volume of motor cortex and hippocampus, the numerical cell density of neurons in layers I, II-III, V, and VI of the motor cortex, the entire motor cortex as well as the primary motor cortex, and the numerical density of the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus subregions of the hippocampus were estimated. No significant differences were observed in the evaluated parameters.

3746,"A Protocol for Transcranial Photobiomodulation Therapy in Mice Transcranial photobiomodulation is a potential innovative noninvasive therapeutic approach for improving brain bioenergetics, brain function in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders, and memory enhancement in age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. We describe a laboratory protocol for transcranial photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) in mice. Aged BALB/c mice (18 months old) are treated with a 660 nm laser transcranially, once daily for 2 weeks. Laser transmittance data shows that approximately 1% of the incident red light on the scalp reaches a 1 mm depth from the cortical surface, penetrating the dorsal hippocampus. Treatment outcomes are assessed by two methods: a Barnes maze test, which is a hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory task evaluation, and measuring hippocampal ATP levels, which is used as a bioenergetics index. The results from the Barnes task show an enhancement of the spatial memory in laser-treated aged mice when compared with age-matched controls. Biochemical analysis after laser treatment indicates increased hippocampal ATP levels. We postulate that the enhancement of memory performance is potentially due to an improvement in hippocampal energy metabolism induced by the red laser treatment. The observations in mice could be extended to other animal models since this protocol could potentially be adapted to other species frequently used in translational neuroscience, such as rabbit, cat, dog, or monkey. Transcranial photobiomodulation is a safe and cost-effective modality which may be a promising therapeutic approach in age-related cognitive impairment.",Excluded,0.08593597

GDNF as well as TGF-beta1 enhanced the total number of lectin-positive cells and decreased the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei, while no effect on proliferation was observed. Both factors suppressed the secretion of nitrite during the first 4 days of culturing, and GDNF but not TGF-beta1 reduced the secretion of LDH in 2-week-old cultures.

3749,"Identification of the S3 foramen during transforaminal sacral neuromodulation lead placement-a novel ""rolling pen"" technique INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is FDA approved for urinary urgency, urinary frequency, urgency urinary incontinence, non-obstructive urinary retention and fecal incontinence. SNM modulates electrical input to the bladder preventing and decreasing over stimulation, thus improving symptoms. The S3 foramen must be localized for lead implantation and the efficacy of implantation depends on the ability to localize S3 reliably and correctly. Localization is accomplished using various strategies, most commonly using a combination of palpation of bony landmarks and fluoroscopy. This paper will serve to introduce a novel ""rolling pen"" technique that eliminates the use of fluoroscopy for S3 identification. This technique is currently used in clinical practice by the two highest volume implanters in Louisiana. METHOD(S): The patients were positioned prone and prepped in the usual manner. Instead of using fluoroscopy or palpation to identify bony landmarks to localize the S3 foramen, we balanced a marking pen longitudinally in the midline of the sacrum. The pen was allowed to roll until horizontal equilibrium was established. The fulcrum of the balanced ""rolling pen"" identified the level of S3. A mark 2 cm proximal and 2 cm lateral to this landmark was made for entry of the finder needle at the level of the skin. We then proceeded with our implantation in the usual manner. The rolling pen technique was used for all patients as our initial strategy to identify the S3 foramen. RESULT(S): 228 implantations were performed between 7/2012 and 10/2014 at our 2 tertiary centers. All cases used the rolling pen technique as our initial S3 foramen identification strategy. Adhering to the ALARA principle, fluoroscopy was limited to confirming and adjusting needle and lead placement in the operating room. All office procedures were performed without fluoroscopy. CONCLUSION(S): We conclude that the novel rolling pen technique can be used as yet another method for S3 localization during transforaminal lead placement during SNM implantation.

The criteria used to define this unusual pathologic association are discussed.RESULTS: There was a male predominance. Post-radiation gliomas were particularly malignant, the average dose was 33 Gy, and average free latency was 9.6 years. The first disease was most frequently acute lymphatic leukemia.CONCLUSIONS: Post-radiation gliomas have particular features but do not present a histologic or clinical behavior different from analogous spontaneous gliomas. The fact that 88 cases have been reported in recent years suggests that a thorough biological, clinical studies be carried out on this association. [References: 56]",Excluded,0.098271266
3751,Disorders of energy metabolism in the rat brain under extreme exposures: a new method for assessing the energy state of the brain. [Russian] We propose a new method to evaluate energy state of the brain based on vital assay for phosphate metabolites and intracellular pH in the brain. A proposed Z-index describes a set of correlations between phosphates involved in brain energy metabolism assayed in vivo by magnetic resonance spectroscopy on 31P nuclei. We tried to use Z-index as a quantitative test for disturbed energy metabolism. Potentialities of Z-index for evaluating rat brain energy state after extreme influences (gamma [correction of X-] irradiation and postoperative shock of the brain cortex) have been demonstrated.,Excluded,0.9650182
3752,"Impact of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with central neurocytoma: A multicentric international analysis Background: Central neurocytoma (CN) is a rare tumor accounting for <0.5% of all intracranial tumors. Surgery +/- radiotherapy is the mainstay treatment. This international multicentric study aims to evaluate the outcomes of CNs patients after multimodal therapies and identify predictive factors. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively identified 33 patients with CN treated between 2005 and 2019. Treatment characteristics and outcomes were assessed. Result(s): All patients with CN underwent surgical resection. Radiotherapy was delivered in 19 patients. The median radiation dose was 54 Gy (range, 50-60 Gy). The median follow-up time was 56 months. The 5-year OS and 5-year PFS were 90% and 76%, respectively. Patients who received radiotherapy had a significantly longer PFS than patients without RT (p = 0.004) and a trend towards longer OS. In addition, complete response after treatments was associated with longer PFS (p = 0.07). Conclusion(s): Using RT seems to be associated with longer survival rates with an acceptable toxicity profile. Copyright Â© 2021 by the authors.

In a total of 77 patients treated for oral or neck cancer, 188 implants were consecutively placed. After a healing period, the successfully integrated implants were restored with 69 removable and 38 fixed restorations. The implants cumulative survival and success rates were evaluated over a period of at least 36 months. In addition, cumulative success rates were calculated for implant subgroups divided per implant site (mandible or maxilla), radiation dosage, and the time interval between the last irradiation and implant placement. During the healing period, 20 implants did not successfully integrate, whereas 168 implants were classified as success (including both survival and success rates). The analysis of implant subgroups showed slightly more favorable cumulative success rate for mandibular implants (98.4%) compared with maxillary implants (57.1%) and clearly better success rate for a radiation dosage minor of 50-Gy doses. A time greater than 12 months as interval between last irradiation and implant placement seems not to promote better clinical results.",Excluded,0.915188
3754,"Initial evaluation of the feasibility of single photon emission tomography with p-[<sup>123</sup>I]iodo-L-phenylalanine for routine brain tumour imaging p-[<sup>123</sup>I]iodo-L-phenylalanine (IPA) is a recently described radiopharmaceutical which is highly accumulated in gliomas. The present investigation was designed to evaluate the feasibility of single photon emission tomography (SPET) with IPA to image brain tumours under routine clinical conditions. Using a dual- and a triple-headed SPET camera, whole-body kinetic and brain SPET, as well as plasma, urinary and dosimetric analysis were determined in four patients with gliomas after intravenous injection of IPA. Results obtained by IPA SPET were retrospectively compared with histopathology, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography with [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose. Tumour lesions were clearly demonstrated by IPA SPET at 30 min, 1 h and 4.5 h post-injection, even in patients with low grade gliomas. In patients with glioblastoma, excellent visualization of the tumour was possible even at 7 h p.i., indicative of the high retention of the radiopharmaceutical in cerebral gliomas. Analysis of the radioactivity in plasma and urine attested to the high in vivo stability of IPA. Blood clearance was rapid (> 65% after 10 min) and IPA was excreted predominantly by the kidneys, the urinary radioactivity excretion ranging from 27% at 1 h to 54% of injected doses at 5 h p.i. The average effective dose for adults was estimated to be 0.0152 mSv.MBq<sup>-1</sup>, leading to an effective dose of 3.8 mSv in a typical brain SPET investigation with 250 MBq IPA. This result strongly suggests that IPA is a potentially valuable brain tumour imaging agent for widespread clinical studies with SPET. Its high specific tumour uptake and retention even in low grade gliomas represent a major advantage compared to presently available SPET radiopharmaceuticals. Moreover, the radiation dose estimates indicate that clinical use of IPA will result in acceptable radiation dose levels in humans. (Â© 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins).",Excluded,0.08562395

3756,"Zinc distribution in various tissues, (brain, eye, skin, muscle and blood) of rat during hindlimb suspension Postural changes in 1-G environment induce well documented haemodynamic changes. On going from Earth's 1-G environment to the microgravity of space a marked cephalic blood volume shift occurs in humans with a subsequent loss of 2-3 L of fluid determined by diuresis and decreased fluid intake. Moreover, a number of transient changes in serum concentrations of sodium, potassium and calium have been observed in astronauts during spaceflight. It is conceivable that changes in the fluid status, and reduced muscle activities, which are changed by the microgravity environment, would also result in redistribution of some trace elements, such as zinc, copper and manganese. In particular, zinc metabolism, directly involved in many physiological processes, can be altered by a wide variety of factors including stress, rest, exercise, hormones and diet. Some of the microgravity-induced responses in space can be simulated in humans by using the posture of head-down tilt, and in rat by using the posture of hindlimb suspension. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of hindlimb suspension for 3-14 days on sodium, potassium and zinc content in various rat tissues including blood, muscle, brain, eye and nose's skin.",Excluded,0.09156601
3757,"Fractionated ionizing radiation accelerates loss of amplified MDR1 genes harbored by extrachromosomal DNA in tumor cells In tumor specimens such as those from neuroblastoma, ovarian, and lung carcinoma patients, the prevalence of extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules harboring amplified genes has been well established. In some cases, the amplified genes have been identified as oncogenes, and their increased expression appears to contribute to the maintenance and progression of the malignancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fractionated radiation treatment, given in daily doses similar to those administered clinically, on the stability of extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules in cancer cells. Our studies were conducted with multidrug-resistant KB cells, which harbor extrachromosomal copies of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) almost exclusively on circular DNA molecules of approximately 750 and 1500 kb pairs. This size range is representative of extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules that have been shown to harbor amplified oncogenes in vivo. Exponentially growing MDR KB cells were exposed to 1400 and 2800 cGy ionizing radiation administered in 7 and 14 fractions, respectively, at 200 cGy per fraction/day. A statistically significant decrease in MDR1 extrachromosomal gene copy number was reproducibly detected in the irradiated cells compared with unirradiated cells passaged for the duration of the experiment in the absence of radiation treatment. This decrease was accompanied by a reduction in multidrug resistance and in P-glycoprotein levels, as determined by clonogenic dose-response assays and Western analyses, respectively. P-glycoprotein is a multidrug transporter encoded by the MDR1 gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies further determined that extrachromosomal circular DNA loss correlated to the entrapment of these DNA molecules in radiation-induced micronuclei. These results indicate that radiation-induced loss of extrachromosomally amplified genes from tumor cells via their entrapment in micronuclei contributes to the improved therapeutic response observed for some cancers.",Excluded,0.11285624

A. calamus extract (250 mg/kg body weight) was orally administered to mice 1 h prior to whole body gamma-radiation exposure. The antioxidant levels in the tissue homogenates of brain, liver and kidney of the irradiated mice were determined and cellular DNA damage was monitored by comet assay. Effect of administration of the extract on survival of the animals exposed to acute lethal dose of 10 Gy whole body gamma-radiations was also monitored. Administration of the extract significantly increased the activities of major enzymes of the antioxidant defense system specially SOD, catalase and GPx and levels of GSH in 2, 6 and 10 Gy irradiated mice and decreased the formation MDA. The extract also decreased DNA strand breaks. The survival rate was found to be increased up to 5%.

3760,"Assembly of actin-containing cortex occurs at distal regions of growing neurites in PC12 cells Although actin filaments are known to be localized in the cortex of axons and in the growth cones of nerve cells, it is unclear how actin-containing structures are assembled during nerve growth. We have studied the formation of actin structures in growing neurites by microinjecting fluorescent phalloidin or actin into PC12 neuron-like cells to label endogenous actin filaments. Upon stimulation of neurite growth in cells microinjected with fluorescent phalloidin, little or no fluorescence was detected in nascent growth cones and adjacent neurites despite the presence of actin filaments in these regions, suggesting that actin filaments were primarily formed by de novo assembly rather than the transport and reorganization of pre-existing, phalloidin-labeled actin filaments. Time-lapse observations of the distribution of phalloidin-labeled actin filaments during neurite elongation confirmed that fluorescence associated with pre-existing neurite cortex spread out more slowly than the elongation of neurites. Furthermore, when a dark spot was photobleached with a laser microbeam along neurites of cells microinjected with either fluorescent phalloidin or actin, the spot showed no appreciable translocation during active neurite elongation. Taken together, these results suggest that de novo assembly of actin filaments plays a crucial role in the formation of growth cones and adjacent cortex in the distal region of neurites, but does not appear to require the anterograde or retrograde transport of cortical filaments, or the passive stretching of the proximal segment of the neurite cortex.",Excluded,0.08602759

3762,"Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors: The Impact of Treatment on Patient Outcome Primary central nervous system (CNS) germinoma is readily curable with relatively large volume/high dose radiotherapy but the late effects of treatment may alter neurocognitive functioning and quality of life. Prior studies have associated radiation therapy with deficits in the domains of intelligence, attention, memory, and psychomotor processing speed, with risk factors including young age at irradiation and increased irradiation volume and dosage level. Furthermore, cranial irradiation may also lead to diminished height, neuroendocrine dysfunction, and hearing loss. Few germ cell tumor follow-up studies have adequately examined the late effects of therapy, with results varying between lowered physical quality of life without significant cognitive sequelae to significant correlations between young age at treatment and lowered levels of intellectual functioning and quality of life. Consequently, further investigation is warranted that includes baseline and biannual psychological assessments that focus beyond a singular measure of intelligence and provide data on a range of domains such as attention-concentration, memory and executive functioning, as well as quality of life, social-emotional and behavioral functioning. Since systemic and CNS germ cell tumors are highly sensitive to chemotherapy as well as to radiotherapy, future studies should examine whether the addition of chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy will permit response-based reductions in radiotherapy fields and allow the administration of doses that will translate into meaningful improvements in functional outcome with preservation of excellent long-term disease control.",Excluded,0.8831585
3763,"Absorbed doses to kidneys based on one or two SPECT measurements versus three SPECT measurements in 777 patients with neuroendocrine tumours receiving<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE therapy Aim/Introduction: As in all therapies using ionizing radiation, a patient-specific optimization of the delivered radiation should be performed in therapy with<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE. At our centre, the number of treatments is based on the absorbed dose (AD) to the kidneys. For logistical reasons, estimation of absorbed doses should be performed with as few measurements as possible. The aim of the present work was to study how well kidney AD and effective half-life (t<inf>eff</inf>) estimations using methods with one or two measurement points agree with the method we use today that is based on three imaging points. Material(s) and Method(s): 777 patients (333 female and 444 male) with neuroendocrine tumors with high somatostatin receptor expression were included. SPECT/CT over the abdomen were acquired at 24, 96 and 168 h after start of infusion of<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE. AD and teff were calculated using single exponential fits to data from 3 measurements (24-96-168) or two measurements (24- 96 and 24-168). In addition, absorbed doses were calculated using a single measurement, assuming t<inf>eff</inf>50 h (96/50h). Bias of AD and teff values relative to those based on the three-point measurement were calculated. To test statistical significance a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test with a P-value of 0.05 for significance was used. Median, Min and Max of the deviations were also calculated. Result(s): Bias versus AD(24-96- 168) was -3%(-20-72) (Median (Min-Max)) for AD(24-96), 3%(-22- 30) for AD(24-168) and -7%(-51-27) for AD(96/50h). The bias for teff in the AD calculations versus AD(24-96-168) was -9% (-53- 63) for AD(24-96) and 0% (-9-4) for AD(24-168). In all tests there was a small but significant difference for the whole group. In about 15% of the patients the bias in t<inf>eff</inf>was more than 20% when ignoring the 168-h scan. In about 5-10% of the patients AD differed more than 20% for all methods that excluded the 168-h measurement. Using a fixed limit of the absorbed dose to the kidneys, this would mean that these patients would be given either too many or too few treatments. Conclusion(s): Although absorbed dose calculations based on only one or two measurement points may serve as a good approximation for the majority of patients, it leads to substantial errors affecting the number of given treatments in about 10% of patients. Since this is a radiation treatment a high precision for all patients is warranted, and three measurements, or at least inclusion of a late 168-h measurement, are recommended.",Excluded,0.19638191

Clinical and radiographic data were retrospectively reviewed. Early progression was defined as radiological progression (RECIST criteria) during or within eight weeks of completing RT/TMZ. Pseudoprogression was defined as early progression with subsequent disease stabilization, without salvage therapy, for at least six months from completion of RT/TMZ. The primary outcome was overall survival (Kaplan-Meier) and log rank analysis was used to compare groups.RESULTS: Out of 111 patients analyzed, 104 were evaluable for radiological response. Median age was 58 years and median follow-up 55 weeks. Early progression was confirmed in 26% and within this group 32% had psPD. Median survival for the whole cohort was 56.7 weeks [95% CI (51.0, 71.3)]. Median survival for patients with psPD was significantly higher than for patients with true early progression (124.9 weeks versus 36.0 weeks, p = 0.0286).CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one third of patients with early progression were found to have psPD which was associated with a favourable prognosis.

The controls were 475 patients with no history of radiation therapy who underwent carotid revascularization in a similar period. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (US), and computed tomography angiography results were correlated with outcomes of histologic analysis of CEA specimens. End points included ipsilateral and contralateral stroke, myocardial infarction, restenosis, in-stent thrombosis, and target lesion revascularization.RESULTS: Vulnerable plaques on carotid MRI (86% vs 64.2%; P = .010) and mobile (27% vs 8.0%; P = .008) and ulcerative (50% vs 15.8%; P < .001) plaques on US were more frequent in the RICS group. All revascularization procedures were successful, and no occlusion occurred. Adverse events in the CAS group, including one minor stroke and one transient ischemic attack within 30 days as well as five ipsilateral neurologic events after 30 days, including three minor strokes and two transient ischemic attacks, were significantly more frequent than in the CEA group.

Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed activation of rostral/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in normal subjects studied previously. Activity in this region was not significant in MS patients, but there was a large region of activity in superior temporal cortex.

3772,"Bevacizumab, temozolomide, and radiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma: comprehensive safety results during and after first-line therapy BACKGROUND: The proposed use of bevacizumab with radiotherapy/temozolomide for newly diagnosed glioblastoma raised potential safety concerns. Bevacizumab has been linked with stroke, bleeding events, and wound-healing complications in other tumor types; these events are of particular concern for glioblastoma (highly vascular tumors that are usually resected). Published data on the interaction of bevacizumab with radiotherapy/temozolomide are also limited. We report safety data from a phase III randomized trial (Avastin in Glioblastoma), focusing on these considerations.METHODS: Eligible patients received: radiotherapy and temozolomide plus bevacizumab/placebo, 6 cycles; a 4-week treatment break; temozolomide plus bevacizumab/placebo, 6 cycles; and bevacizumab/placebo until progression. Data on adverse events (AEs) were collected throughout.RESULTS: Bevacizumab-treated patients (n = 461) had a longer median safety follow-up time (12.3 vs 8.5 mo), and a higher proportion completed 6 cycles of maintenance temozolomide (64.6% vs 36.9%) versus placebo (n = 450). The incidences of relevant AEs (bevacizumab vs placebo, respectively) were: arterial thromboembolic events (5.9% vs 1.6%); cerebral hemorrhage (3.3% vs 2.0%); wound-healing complications (6.9% vs 4.7%); thrombocytopenia (34.1% vs 27.3%); radiotherapy-associated skin injury (8.2% vs 9.3%); alopecia (39.0% vs 36.0%); gastrointestinal perforation (including gastrointestinal abscesses and fistulae, 1.7% vs 0.4%); and radiotherapy-associated injury (0.4% vs 0.0%). Overall, 15.8% and 23.8% of bevacizumab- and placebo-treated patients had surgery (including biopsy) after progression.

However, high-quality fast spin-echo imaging deposits significant heat, exceeding FDA-approved limits when patients already have undergone deep brain stimulation and need a second one or a routine brain MR imaging for neurologic indications. We have developed a STIR sequence with an ultra-low specific absorption rate that meets hardware limitations and produces adequate tissue contrast in cortical and subcortical brain tissues for deep brain stimulation recipients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with medically refractory Parkinson disease who qualified for deep brain stimulation were imaged at 1.5T with a fast spin-echo short tau inversion recovery sequence modified to meet conditional MR imaging hardware and specific absorption rate restrictions. Tissue contrast-to-noise ratios and implant localization were objectively and subjectively compared by 2 neuroradiologists, and image quality for surgical planning was assessed by a neurosurgeon for high and low specific absorption rate images.RESULTS: The mean contrast-to-noise ratio for cerebral tissues without including the contrast-to-noise ratio for ventricular fluid was 35 and 31 for high and low specific absorption rate images. Subjective ratings for low specific absorption rate tissue contrast in 77% of patients were identical to (and in a few cases higher than) those of high specific absorption rate contrast, while the neurosurgical coordinates for fusing the stereotactic atlas with low specific absorption rate MR imaging were equivalent to those of the high specific absorption rate for 69% of patients.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Parkinson disease who have already had a deep brain stimulation face a risk of neural injury if routine, high specific absorption rate MR imaging is performed. Our modified fast spin-echo short tau inversion recovery sequence conforms to very conservative radiofrequency safety limits, while it maintains high tissue contrast for presurgical planning, postsurgical assessment, and radiologic evaluations with greater confidence for radiofrequency safety.",Excluded,0.086018756

3776,"Arg and DAP3 expression was correlated with human thymoma stage Thymoma is one of the most common solid tumors in the mediastinum. As there is no typical cell line for human thymoma, the development and use of molecular-based therapy for thymoma will require detailed molecular genetic analysis of patients' tissues. The recent reports showed that the gain of chromosome 1q regions was frequent in thymoma. We investigated the use of oligonucleotide arrays to monitor in vivo gene expression levels at chromosome 1q regions in the early- (stage I or II) and late-stage (stage IVa) thymoma tissues from patients. These in vivo gene expression profiles were verified by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using LightCycler for 36 thymoma patients. Using both the methods, candidate genes were come up. These are Arg tyrosine kinase and death-associated protein 3 (DAP3), which are known as ionizing radiation resistance conferring proteins. The Arg/GAPDH mRNA level in stage IV thymoma (90.716 +/- 177.851) was significantly higher than in stage I thymoma (10.335 +/- 25.744, P = 0.0465). The DAP3/GAPDH mRNA level in stage IV thymoma (17.424 +/- 20.649) was significantly higher than in stage I thymoma (5.184 +/- 3.878, P = 0.0305).

3777,"The effect of ultraviolet B irradiation on nitric oxide synthase expression in murine keratinocytes Nitric oxide (NO), which has several physiological functions in skin, is generated by NO synthase (NOS). NOS has at least three isoforms; endothelial NOS (eNOS), brain NOS (bNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS). Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation has been reported to stimulate NO production in skin via induction or activation of NOS, however, the exact mechanism of NOS induction by UVB irradiation remains obscure. In this study, we investigated the direct effect of UVB on the expression of NOS isoforms in murine keratinocytes, and found a significant increase in NO production within 48 h. mRNA and protein expressions of bNOS were both enhanced by UVB irradiation in murine keratinocytes, whereas iNOS mRNA expression was suppressed at 4 and 12 h after UVB irradiation. These results suggest that the enhancement of NO production observed after UVB irradiation in murine keratinocytes may be explained in part by the upregulation of bNOS expression, but not iNOS expression.",Excluded,0.08737719

Electroencephalography revealed frequent spikes in the left temporal lobe. In response to clonazepam, but not antipsychotics, her auditory hallucinations almost completely disappeared and spikes were reduced. Her auditory hallucinations exhibited the characteristics of first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia, however, the content of experiential auditory hallucinations endured by our patient suggested an epileptic origin.

There are four types of cone visual pigments and a single type of rod visual pigment. The reaction process of the rod visual pigment, rhodopsin, has been extensively investigated, whereas there have been few studies of cone visual pigments. Here we comprehensively investigated the reaction processes of cone visual pigments on a time scale of milliseconds to minutes, using flash photolysis equipment optimized for cone visual pigment photochemistry. We used chicken violet (L-group), chicken blue (M1-group), chicken green (M2-group), and monkey green (L-group) visual pigments as representatives of the respective groups of the phylogenetic tree of cone pigments. The S, M1, and M2 pigments showed the formation of a pH-dependent mixture of meta intermediates, similar to that formed from rhodopsin. Although monkey green (L-group) also formed a mixture of meta intermediates, pH dependency of meta intermediates was not observed. However, meta intermediates of monkey green became pH dependent when the chloride ion bound to the monkey green was replaced with a nitrate ion. These results strongly suggest that rhodopsin and S, M1, and M2 cone visual pigments share a molecular mechanism for activation, whereas the L-group pigment may have a special reaction mechanism involving the chloride-binding site.",Excluded,0.086461425
3780,"The role of tumor vascularity in predicting survival after yttrium-90 radioembolization for liver metastases PURPOSE: It is unclear what role pretreatment tumor vascularity plays in determining outcomes after yttrium-90 radioembolization. A hypothesis was tested that radiographic vascularity of a tumor does not affect patient survival.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this two-institution retrospective study, 137 patients with metastatic liver disease underwent (90)Y radioembolization. Primary sites were categorized as colon, neuroendocrine, and other. All patients underwent triphasic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging, as well as detailed hepatic angiography. Two board-certified interventional radiologists interpreted all images and evaluated them for the presence of enhancement. Median survival times, as well as 1- and 2-year survival rates, were compared between patients with hypervascular and hypovascular tumors on (i) cross-sectional imaging and (ii) angiography with use of the log-rank statistic (alpha = 0.05).RESULTS: On angiography, 108 patients had hypervascular tumors and 29 had hypovascular tumors. Median survival times for the two subgroups were 300 days and 261 days, respectively (P = .95). On CT, 24 patients had hypervascular tumors and 113 had hypovascular tumors. Median survival times for these subgroups were 306 days and 284 days, respectively (P = .67). Eighty-four patients' tumors that were hypovascular on CT were hypervascular on angiography. There were no statistical differences in survival between patients with hypervascular and hypovascular tumors, regardless if vascularity was defined based on CT or angiography.CONCLUSIONS: Radiographic vascular appearance of liver tumors, regardless of imaging modality, does not affect survival after radioembolization. Therefore, hypovascular tumors should not be considered contraindicated for radioembolization.",Excluded,0.094642125

3782,"A strong constant magnetic field affects muscle tension development in bullfrog neuromuscular preparations Effects of a constant magnetic field (CMF) of 0.65 T on muscle tension over 9 h were studied in the neuromuscular preparation of the bullfrog sartorius muscle. Tension was developed every 30 min by stimulation of the sciatic nerve (nerve stimulation) or of the sartorius muscle itself (muscle stimulation). In sciatic nerve stimulation, tension decreased rapidly for the first 3-4 h at a similar rate in both test (exposed to CMF) and control muscles. However, the rate of decrease became smaller and almost leveled off after 3-4 h in the test muscles, whereas tension continued to decrease monotonically in control muscles. The slope of the decrease for these later periods was significantly different between the test and the control conditions. Accordingly, tension was larger in test than in control muscles. In muscle stimulation, tension decreased monotonically from the start of experiments in control muscles, while tension in test muscles maintained their initial values for almost 3 h. Thereafter they started to decrease with a similar rate to the control. Hence, tension was always larger in test than in control muscles. A similar pattern of temporal change was observed for the rate of rise of the maximum tension for nerve or muscle stimulation. However, a significant difference was detected only in the case of muscle stimulation. The present results showed that a strong CMF of 0.65 T had biological effects on tension development of the bullfrog sartorius muscle by stimulation of the sciatic nerve as well as by stimulation of muscle itself. The presence of a small AC magnetic field component leaves open the possibility of an AC, rather than a CMF effect. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded,0.086319044

In quiet, nonreverberant backgrounds, pitch can be derived from timing information in broadband high-frequency auditory channels and/or from frequency and timing information carried in narrowband low-frequency auditory channels. Recording from single neurons in the cochlear nucleus of anesthetized guinea pigs, we show that the neural representation of pitch based on timing information is severely degraded in the presence of reverberation. This degradation increases with both increasing reverberation strength and channel bandwidth. In a parallel human psychophysical pitch-discrimination task, reverberation impaired the ability to distinguish a high-pass harmonic sound from noise. Together, these findings explain the origin of perceptual difficulties experienced by both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners in reverberant spaces.",Excluded,0.08612224

We report the effect of re-irradiation with active scanning PT of large recurrence GBM in terms of quality of life scored by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)--C30 and EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Brain Cancer Module (QLQ-BN20). Material(s) and Method(s): Between January 2015 and October 2018 thirty patients with recurrence GBM were re-irradiated with active scanning PT. All patients had been previously treated with photon radiotherapy (60 Gy) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ). Median age and Karnofsky performance status at re-irradiation were 53 years (range, 30-68 years) and 80%, (range, 60-100%), respectively. Target definition was based on CT, MR, and 18F-DOPA PET imaging. Median CTV (clinical target volume) was 69 cc (range, 11-259 cc). All patients received 36 GyRBE (RBE: relative biologic effectiveness) in 18 fractions, with concomitant TMZ in 7 patients (25%). Subscales within the EORTC QLQ-C30 include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), three symptoms scales (nausea, vomiting, and fatigue), six single-item scales (insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, dyspnea, and financial effect of tumor/treatment) and global QoL. The BN20 is specifically developed for brain patients and assessed visual disorders, motor function, communication deficit, various disease symptoms, treatment, toxicity and future uncertainty. The patients completed the EORTC questionnaires before starting PT, the day of the end of PT and every follow-up consult (1-month, 3-months) until progression of disease. Result(s): The treatment was associated with stability in most of the preselected HRQOL domains. Global health improved over time with a maximum difference of 6 points between baseline and 3-months follow-up. Social functioning and motor dysfunction improved over time with a maximum difference of 8 and 2 points, respectively. We showed only a small not significance decrease in cognitive and emotional functioning. Interestingly, fatigue remained stable during the analysis such as the other preselected domains. Increase of CTV, use of steroids before protontherapy and concomitant chemotherapy are associated with a statistically significantworse QLQ C30_Social, QLQ C30_Physical and BN20_Motor values.

3790,"Adrenergic control of rat pineal NO synthase We have previously shown that exposure of rats to constant light (LL) induced a decrease in NO synthase (NOS) activity in the pineal gland. We present here the evidence that chronic (5 days) norepinephrine (NE) or isoproterenol treatment prevents the effect of LL and enhances pineal NOS activity in LL animals. This effect of NE appears to be mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, because it was not mimicked by the alpha-agonist phenylephrine. Pineal NOS activity was reduced in 16-h light/8-h dark animals treated for 4 days with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol but not with the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin, indicating again an involvement of beta-adrenergic receptor in the control of NOS. Treatment with adrenergic antagonists did not affect cortical NOS activity, suggesting that the control of NOS is different in these two tissues or that the pineal expresses a specific isoform of the enzyme. Taken together, these data suggest that NE controls NOS in the pineal gland through beta-adrenergic receptors. To our knowledge, this represent the first demonstration of a regulation of NOS by a neurotransmitter in the CNS, as assayed under Vmax conditions.",Excluded,0.08657053
3791,"Radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases based on a fast, three-dimensional MR imaging technique A fast, three-dimensional (3D) sequence for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain and its application in radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases is reported. The measuring sequence (MPRAGE) requires magnetization-prepared 180degree inversion pulses followed by rapid low angle excitation pulses and gradient-echoes for image generation. The resulting T<inf>1</inf>-weighted MPRAGE images were compared with two-dimensional (2D) T<inf>1</inf>- weighted spin-echo (SE) images after administration of 0.1 mmol/kg b.w. Gd- DTPA in 10 patients with known brain metastases. Original or multiplanar reformatted images obtained from a 128 partition data set of the 3D MPRAGE sequence offered comparable diagnostic quality to that of 2D SE imaging. Gd- DTPA enhancement and lesion targeting was similar in most of the patients in SE as well as MPRAGE imaging. During imaging and therapy the patient's head was fixed in a stereotactic localization system which is usable at the MR and the linear accelerator installations. The dose calculation of the radiosurgery planning was based on 3D MR imaging data assuming a homogenous attenuation value inside the head which was sufficient for an accurate dose calculation since tissue inhomogeneities do not significantly influence the shape of the relative dose distribution especially for radiosurgery of the brain. Under this circumstance the dose calculation can be based only on the 3D geometric conformation of the patient's head. A simple algorithm for treatment planning can be used if the MR data are free of geometric distortion. Target point definition, external head contour, and critical structures could be precisely defined in 3D MPRAGE images offering important advantages (i.e., improved spatial resolution, reformatted image reconstruction, rapid 3D imaging and short examination time under mask fixation resulting in better patient comfort, better slice profile, reduced vascular pulsation artefacts, superior and variable choice of soft tissue contrast due to centric phase-encoding order, lower specific absorption rate) over conventional 2D SE imaging. In addition, target volume, calculated dose distribution, and critical structures can be displayed as 3D shaded structures for better assessment for matching of target volume and dose distribution. These findings, along with other advantages of 3D imaging, indicate that the MPRAGE sequence may provide an alternative to T<inf>1</inf>-weighted 2D SE imaging in the radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases.",Excluded,0.08581673

The present report focuses on quality of life (QoL) and Karnofsky performance score (KPS) during the whole course of the disease. Methods Patients (n = 170) received standard radiotherapy and were randomized (2:1) for BEV/IRI or standard temozolomide. At least every 3 months KPS was determined and QoL was measured using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Core Quality of Life and 20-item Brain Neoplasm questionnaires. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model evaluated differences in the course of QoL and KPS over time. Also, the time to first deterioration and the time to postprogression deterioration were analyzed separately. Results In all dimensions of QoL and KPS, GEE analyses and time to first deterioration analyses did not detect significant differences between the treatment arms. At progression, 82% of patients receiving second-line therapy in the standard arm received BEV second-line therapy. For the dimensions of motor dysfunction and headaches, time to postprogression deterioration was prolonged in the standard arm receiving crossover second-line BEV in the vast majority of patients at the time of evaluation. Conclusions GLARIUS did not find indications for a BEV-induced detrimental effect on QoL in first-line therapy of MGMT-nonmethylated GBM patients. Moreover, GLARIUS provided some indirect corroborative data supporting the notion that BEV may have beneficial effects upon QoL in relapsed GBM.

Somatostatin receptor imaging has been shown to be an important part of the diagnostic process in the management of NET for a long time. In recent years a number of tracers enabling PET-based imaging of somatostatin receptors and amine precursor uptake have been developed. By combining the specific functional information of the PET signal with anatomical information by CT imaging using PET-CT hybrid scanners, primary tumors and metastases can be detected with high resolution and high sensitivity. Compared with conventional indium-111 octreotide scintigraphy PET-CT has a higher resolution and also a lower radiation exposure. In addition, quantification of the tracer uptake allows therapy monitoring. By labelling with therapeutic beta-emitters, such as lutetium-177 or yttrium-90, a systemic internal radiotherapy with somotostatin analogues (peptide radionuclide radiation therapy, PRRT) can be provided as a therapeutic option for patients with unresectable and metastasized neuroendocrine tumors.

There is little information, however, about the direct effect of night work on the risk of cancer. We investigated the effect of night work in breast cancer.METHODS: We examined the relationship between breast cancer and working on rotating night shifts during 10 years of follow-up in 78 562 women from the Nurses' Health Study. Information was ascertained in 1988 about the total number of years during which the nurses had worked rotating night shifts with at least three nights per month. From June 1988 through May 1998, we documented 2441 incident breast cancer cases. Logistic regression models were used to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for confounding variables and breast cancer risk factors. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: We observed a moderate increase in breast cancer risk among the women who worked 1-14 years or 15-29 years on rotating night shifts (multivariate adjusted RR = 1.08 [95% CI = 0.99 to 1.18] and RR = 1.08 [95% CI = 0.90 to 1.30], respectively).

Although recurrent spinal cord compression is a common problem, little is known about whether reirradiation preserves neurologic function and what risk of radiation myelopathy it carries. To investigate this question, we reviewed patients at the Mayo Clinic between 1975 and 1992 undergoing two or more courses of radiotherapy to the same segment of the spinal column with radiographically documented epidural disease at the time of reirradiation to determine outcome as measured by the ability to walk and by survival. Fifty- four patients met the study criteria. Radiation doses for the first course ranged from 2,250 to 5,400 cGy (median, 3,000 cGy), and total dose for all courses to the reirradiated spinal segment ranged from 3,650 to 8,089 cGy (median, 5,425 cGy). All patients were ambulatory following the first course of radiation, 40 (74%) were ambulatory at the onset of reirradiation, and 42 (78%) were ambulatory at the end of reirradiation. Thirty-seven patients (69%) remained ambulatory at their last follow-up 6 days to 80 months following reirradiation (median, 4.7 months). Five patients eventually became nonambulatory 6.5 to 35 months following reirradiation. Median survival for all patients following reirradiation was 4.2 months.

Group A (n = 31) underwent conventional CTA and group B (n = 31) CTA with a novel OSDR algorithm. Subjective and objective image quality were statistically compared. Subjective image quality was rated on a five-point scale. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated with region-of-interest measurements.RESULTS: The SNR of the common carotid artery and middle cerebral artery was 53.6 +/- 22.7 and 43.3 +/- 15.3 (group A) versus 54.1 +/- 20.5 and 46.2 +/- 14.6 (group B).

3801,"Abnormalities of thalamic volume and shape detected in fetally irradiated rhesus monkeys with high dimensional brain mapping Background: Prior research has indicated neuroanatomical abnormalities of the thalamus in schizophrenia. To study the possible pathogenesis, an animal model of neurodevelopmental thalamic damage has been developed by applying low-dose radiation to rhesus monkeys in early gestation. Irradiated monkeys sacrificed as infants demonstrate neuronal losses in specific thalamic nuclei and decreases in cortical neuropil. Method(s): Magnetic resonance scans were collected in adult Rhesus monkeys exposed to irradiation during thalamic neurogenesis (E33-42), after thalamic neurogenesis (E70-81), and in nonirradiated control animals. High dimensional brain mapping was used to compare thalamic volumes and shape characteristics in the three groups of animals. Result(s): Animals exposed to irradiation at E33-42 showed a significant bilateral loss of thalamic volumes (> 20%) compared with controls and with animals irradiated at E70-81 when total brain volume was used as a covariate in the analysis. Thalamic volume loss was associated with a nonuniform deformation of thalamic shape. Conclusion(s): A first-trimester, neurodevelopmental insult in the nonhuman primate during thalamic neurogenesis produces a complex pattern of thalamic volume loss and shape deformation in adulthood.

A pancreatic mass that probed negative proved to be an adenocarcinoma of ductal origin.CONCLUSIONS: Tumor-specific peptide-receptor binding can be detected in situ with 125J-TYR(3)-octreotide and a hand-held gamma-detecting probe.

3803,"Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the endometrium: Disease course, treatment and survival Objective: Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the endometrium (NECE) accounts for only 0.8% of all endometrial carcinoma. The limited literature consists of case reports and small case series, with the largest including 25 patients. We performed a population-based study to describe disease course, treatment, and survival in women with NECE compared to endometrioid endometrial cancer (EC). Method(s): The National Cancer Data Base was used to identify women with NECE and women with poorly differentiated EC from 2004 to 2015. The cohort was limited to women with histologic confirmation and who received hysterectomy without neoadjuvant therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were developed to compare survival between groups using a log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard regression models were fit to analyze associations between survival and histology while adjusting for clinical and demographic differences. Result(s): A total of 28,291 women with EC and 364 women with NECE were identified. More women with neuroendocrine tumors were non-white and presented with later stage disease (P < 0.05 for both). Stage III-IV tumors were diagnosed in 56% of women with NECE versus 26% of women with EC (P < 0.001). Women with NECE were more likely to receive chemotherapy (60% vs 30%, P < 0.001), but were less likely to receive radiation (28% vs 48%, P < 0.001). In a multivariable model, women with NECE were more than twice as likely to die than those with EC tumors (HR = 2.29, 95% CI 1.85-2.84). Similar trends were noted in analyses limited to stage I (HR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.02-2.57) and stage III (HR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.91-3.61) neoplasms. In a Kaplan-Meier analysis, median survival was 17 months (95% CI 12-23) for women with NECE and 144 months (95% CI 140-148) for those with EC (P < 0.001). Five-year survival was 38% (95% CI 32.7-43.8%) in those with NECE vs 69% (95% CI 68.2-69.4%) in those with EC (P < 0.001). See Figure 1.

3805,"Electric field stimulation of precision-cut lung slices The precision-cut lung slice (PCLS) technique is widely used to examine airway responses in different species. We developed a method to study nerve-dependent bronchoconstriction by the application of electric field stimulation (EFS) to PCLS. PCLS prepared from Wistar rats were placed between two platinum electrodes to apply serial rectangular impulses (5-100 Hz), and bronchoconstriction was studied by videomicroscopy. The extent of airway contractions increased with higher frequencies. Stable repeated airway contractions were obtained at a frequency of 50 Hz, a width of 1 ms, and an output of 200 mA for 2.5 s each minute. Larger airways showed stronger responses. The EFS-triggered contractions were increased by the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor neostigmine (10 muM) and reversed by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (10 muM), whereas the thromboxane protanoid receptor antagonist SQ29548 (10 muM) had no effect. Magnesium ions (10 mM) antagonized airway contractions induced by EFS, but not by methacholine, indicating that nerve endings remain intact in PCLS. Our data further show that the electrically evoked airway contractions in PCLS are mediated by cholinergic nerves, independent of thromboxane and more prominent in larger airways. Taken together these findings show that nerve endings remain intact in PCLS, and they suggest that the present method is useful to study neurogenic responses in airways of different size.

Its aim is to induce necrosis or sclerosis inside the target volume. Several techniques permit us to obtain a steep dose gradient between the lesion and the adjacent healthy cerebral parenchyma. They use minibeams (diameter less than 3 cm) of different types of radiations: protons (Kjellberg from Harvard, since 1962); gamma rays of cobalt 60 (Leksell from Stockholm, since 1968); and X-rays from a linear accelerator (Betti from Buenos-Aires, since 1982). The most commonly treated lesions are arterio-venous malformations, hypophyseal adenomas and low grade parenchymatous tumors.

3808,Effects of prenatal ionizing irradiation on the development of the ganglion cell layer of the mouse retina Prenatal exposure to ionizing irradiation has been shown to be an effective method to eliminate selectively certain neuronal population. This investigation studied the effects on the ganglion cell layer of the retinae of adult mice exposed to a gamma source (total dose = 3 Gy) at 16 days gestation. There was a significant reduction in the total number of neurons (displaced amacrine + ganglion cells) in the ganglion cell layer (33%) that was mainly caused by a pronounced loss (59%) of displaced amacrine cells. The diameters of the surviving retinal ganglion cells were consistently larger than those of the controls. Prenatal irradiation is the first experimental approach that partially eliminates displaced amacrine cells. It is suggested that the morphogenesis of retinal ganglion cells may be affected by displaced amacrine cells. Â© 2001 ISDN.,Excluded,0.9843688
3809,"Intrinsic and extrinsic light responses in melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells during mouse development Melanopsin (Opn4) is a photopigment found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that project to various brain areas. These neurons are intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs) and are implicated in nonimage-forming responses to environmental light such as the pupillary light reflex and circadian entrainment. Recent evidence indicates that ipRGCs respond to light at birth, but questions remain as to whether and when they undergo significant functional changes. We used bacterial artificial chromosome transgenesis to engineer a mouse line in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is expressed under the control of the melanopsin promoter. Double immunolabeling for EGFP and melanopsin demonstrates their colocalization in ganglion cells of mutant mouse retinas. Electrophysiological recordings of ipRGCs in neonatal mice (postnatal day 0 [P0] to P7) demonstrated that these cells responded to light with small and sluggish depolarization. However, starting at P11 we observed ipRGCs that responded to light with a larger and faster onset (<1 s) and offset (<1 s) depolarization. These faster, larger depolarizations were observed in most ipRGCs by early adult ages. However, on application of a cocktail of synaptic blockers, we found that all cells responded to light with slow onset (>2.5 s) and offset (>10 s) depolarization, revealing the intrinsic, melanopsin-mediated light responses. The extrinsic, cone/rod influence on ipRGCs correlates with their extensive dendritic stratification in the inner plexiform layer. Collectively, these results demonstrate that ipRGCs make use of melanopsin for phototransduction before eye opening and that these cells further integrate signals derived from the outer retina as the retina matures.",Excluded,0.085933745

Low-density lipoprotein served as a carrier to enhance selective targeting of vascular endothelial cells.RESULTS: Complete choriocapillary occlusion was achieved at a BPD dose of 2 mg/kg and a radiant exposure as low as 10 J/cm2. When PDT was performed 3 hours after BPD application, damage to the neural retina was minimal. Only inner photoreceptor segments showed mitochondrial swelling probably secondary to choroidal ischemia. Bruch's membrane remained intact. Retinal pigment epithelium was invariably damaged as seen with other photosensitizers.CONCLUSION: Compared with photocoagulation BPD-PDT allows endothelial-bound intraluminal photothrombosis, sparing important structures such as neural retina and Bruch's membrane.

A clinical study based on surgery of posterior fossa tumors Three patients who had large, benign cerebellar tumors were operated upon in the sitting position and developed symptoms referable to the temporoparieto-occipital region of the brain 24-48 h postoperatively. They consisted of dizziness, nausea, vomiting, formed and unformed hallucinations, and inversion of image or disorientation in space, some of which were experienced by some of the astronauts and cosmonauts during space flight. Such findings are not due to stimulation of the cerebellum, the site of the lesion, but must come from the cerebral hemisphere. The symptoms were believed to be caused by 'the luxury perfusion' of Lassen with the development of local lactic acidosis secondary to vascular insufficiency to the brain in the distribution of the posterior cerebral artery thus stimulating the temporoparieto-occipital region. This theory is suggested to some degree by the work of Endo et al. using CT scans, which showed the shifting of increased blood flow from the frontal region to the temporoparieto-occipital region following removal of a benign posterior fossa tumor. The mechanism for the compression of the posterior cerebral artery may be due to uncal herniation at the tentorium. The authors believe that it might be well to consider further testing in a vertical or oblique plane rather than only in a centrifugal horizontal one. This method would tend to cause uncal herniation more readily. Monitoring of such effects could be done with the colored CT scan.",Excluded,0.086150125

Electrocortical data (EEG) and a self report on current psychological and physical state were recorded several times prior to and after exercise during the isolation period. Data revealed a clear effect of exercise on mood and electrocortical activity. Moreover, it was shown that mood and brain cortical activity decreased during the first 11 weeks of isolation and reached baseline again in the last week of isolation.

3819,"The CNS germinoma experience at UCSF from 1980 - 2010 Background/Aims. Management for CNS germinomas is controversial. Historically, treatment involved craniospinal irradiation (CSI). For intracranial lesions, however, early evidence suggests that focal radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy may achieve high local control rates and limit radiation toxicity. This study examines the efficacy of treatment approaches in the management of CNS germinoma patients at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Methods. Seventy-nine patients who received primary treatment for germinoma between 1980 and 2010 at UCSF were identified and their charts reviewed. Primary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results. 29 patients were treated with XRT alone and 50 with XRT and chemotherapy. 22 patients received focal XRT, 32 received whole brain irradiation (WBI) and 9 received CSI. Field data was unrecoverable for 16 patients. 14 patients progressed and 8 died from disease. PFS rate at 5 years was 87.7% and OS rate at 5 years was 93.0%. Overall, focal XRT had significantly higher rates of disease progression compared to WBI or CSI (p - 0.047 and p - 0.008 respectively) and among patients who had solitary lesions, focal XRT and chemotherapy had significantly higher rates of disease progression (p - 0 .024) than WBI and chemotherapy.

3820,"Response of extracranial lesions after treatment of metastatic melanoma with cranial radiation and ipilimumab Purpose/Objective(s): Case reports and animal studies suggest combining radiation and immunotherapy may generate responses outside the radiation field. We sought to explore this phenomenon in a systematic fashion by evaluating melanoma patients with brain metastases who were treated with both radiation and ipilimumab. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of sixteen consecutive patients who received ipilimumab and 51 courses of braindirected radiation at a single institution from 2008 to 2013. We examined responses of the largest ""index"" extra-cranial lesion after 31 of these courses where imaging was available before and after treatment and compared this response to two consecutive studies performed prior to radiation therapy when available. Overall survival was calculated from the last day of the first brain-directed radiation therapy course using the Kaplan-Meier method. Responses before and after radiation therapy were compared using McNemar's and the binomial tests for clustered data. Twogroup exact tests for clustered data were used to explore the impact of treatment timing on response. Result(s): Median survival after initial radiation was 14 months, with maximum survival of 50 months. After radiation therapy, the largest index extra-cranial lesion shrank in 35% of 31 instances with sequential imaging as compared to a 17% favorable response rate in the 25 instances with two scans prior to radiation (p = 0.20). There was also a 2.8-fold increased likelihood that the kinetics of index lesion response improved following radiation therapy that did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07). Index lesions were more likely to respond when ipilimumab was administered within three months of radiation (p<0.01). Conclusion(s): Historical series of melanoma patients with brain metastases describe median survival of less than 6 months, and less than 4 months in patients treated with radiation therapy without surgery for these lesions. Our data suggest patients treated with ipilimumab and radiation therapy may fare better than these historical controls.

3821,"Intracellular redox active metal ions mediate the differential susceptibility of lung and brain cancer cells to pharmacological ascorbate Despite recent advances in therapies, 5-year survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has not significantly increased in the past 20 years. The use of pharmacological ascorbate given intravenously has recently emerged as a non-toxic adjuvant to chemo-radiation for the treatment of cancer. However, the mechanism by which pharmacological ascorbate selectively enhances sensitivity of cancer cells versus normal cells to chemo-radiation therapy has yet to be fully elucidated. The current study tests the hypothesis that pharmacological ascorbate selectively enhances chemo-radiation therapy responses via a mechanism that involves increased redox-active metal ions enhancing the oxidation of ascorbate to form hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>). Pharmacological ascorbate, alone or in combination with chemo-radiation, was selectively toxic in all NSCLC and GBM cell lines tested (IC<inf>50</inf> range= 1-2 mM), while exhibiting no toxic effects in human bronchial epithelial primary cells. Additionally, in H292 and U87 murine xenograft models adjuvant ascorbate significantly inhibited tumor growth and increased overall survival as compared to chemo-radiation therapy alone. Ascorbate treatment significantly increased levels of labile iron in cancer and normal cells, however increased steady-state levels of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> were only observed in ascorbate treated cancer cells. The selective cytotoxicity of pharmacological ascorbate in lung cancer cells was significantly inhibited by the addition of exogenous catalase or chelators that bind redox active metal ions. These results support the hypothesis that the selective toxicity of pharmacological ascorbate in cancer vs. normal cells is mediated via an increase in the steady-state level of intracellular H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, mediated by redox active metal ion catalyzed oxidation of ascorbate. Using pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo models of NSCLC and GBM, the current work demonstrates the potential of adjuvant pharmacological ascorbate in treating these cancers.",Excluded,0.0857312

Various parametric and categorical models (such as linear-no-threshold (LNT) and a number of threshold and step models) were analysed with a statistical selection protocol that rated the model description of the data. Instead of applying the usual approach of identifying one preferred model for each data set, a set of plausible models was applied, and a sub-set of non-nested models was identified that all fitted the data about equally well. Subsequently, this sub-set of non-nested models was used to perform multi-model inference (MMI), an innovative method of mathematically combining different models to allow risk estimates to be based on several plausible dose-response models rather than just relying on a single model of choice. This procedure thereby produces more reliable risk estimates based on a more comprehensive appraisal of model uncertainties. For CVD, MMI yielded a weak dose-response (with a risk estimate of about one-third of the LNT model) below a step at 0.6 Gy and a stronger dose-response at higher doses. The calculated risk estimates are consistent with zero risk below this threshold-dose. For mortalities related to cardiovascular diseases, an LNT-type dose-response was found with risk estimates consistent with zero risk below 2.2 Gy based on 90% confidence intervals.

3824,"Brain tumor stem cells: Molecular characteristics and their impact on therapy Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent primary brain tumor and ranks among the most lethal of human cancers with conventional therapy offering only palliation. Great strides have been made in understanding brain cancer genetics and modeling these tumors with new targeted therapies being tested, but these advances have not translated into substantially improved patient outcomes. Multiple chemotherapeutic agents, including temozolomide, the first-line treatment for glioblastoma, have been developed to kill cancer cells. However, the response to temozolomide in GBM is modest. Radiation is also moderately effective but this approach is plagued by limitations due to collateral radiation damage to healthy brain tissue and development of radioresistance. Therapeutic resistance is attributed at least in part to a cell population within the tumor that possesses stem-like characteristics and tumor propagating capabilities, referred to as cancer stem cells. Within GBM, the intratumoral heterogeneity is derived from a combination of regional genetic variance and a cellular hierarchy often regulated by distinct cancer stem cell niches, most notably perivascular and hypoxic regions. With the recent emergence as a key player in tumor biology, cancer stem cells have symbiotic relationships with the tumor microenvironment, oncogenic signaling pathways, and epigenetic modifications. The origins of cancer stem cells and their contributions to brain tumor growth and therapeutic resistance are under active investigation with novel anti-cancer stem cell therapies offering potential new hope for this lethal disease.

3827,"Wwox-Brca1 interaction: role in DNA repair pathway choice In this study, loss of expression of the fragile site-encoded Wwox protein was found to contribute to radiation and cisplatin resistance of cells, responses that could be associated with cancer recurrence and poor outcome. WWOX gene deletions occur in a variety of human cancer types, and reduced Wwox protein expression can be detected early during cancer development. We found that Wwox loss is followed by mild chromosome instability in genomes of mouse embryo fibroblast cells from Wwox-knockout mice. Human and mouse cells deficient for Wwox also exhibit significantly enhanced survival of ionizing radiation and bleomycin treatment, agents that induce double-strand breaks (DSBs). Cancer cells that survive radiation recur more rapidly in a xenograft model of irradiated breast cancer cells; Wwox-deficient cells exhibited significantly shorter tumor latencies vs Wwox-expressing cells. This Wwox effect has important consequences in human disease: in a cohort of cancer patients treated with radiation, Wwox deficiency significantly correlated with shorter overall survival times. In examining mechanisms underlying Wwox-dependent survival differences, we found that Wwox-deficient cells exhibit enhanced homology directed repair (HDR) and decreased non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair, suggesting that Wwox contributes to DNA DSB repair pathway choice. Upon silencing of Rad51, a protein critical for HDR, Wwox-deficient cells were resensitized to radiation. We also demonstrated interaction of Wwox with Brca1, a driver of HDR, and show via immunofluorescent detection of repair proteins at ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage foci that Wwox expression suppresses DSB repair at the end-resection step of HDR. We propose a genome caretaker function for WWOX, in which Brca1-Wwox interaction supports NHEJ as the dominant DSB repair pathway in Wwox-sufficient cells. Taken together, the experimental results suggest that reduced Wwox expression, a common occurrence in cancers, dysregulates DSB repair, enhancing efficiency of likely mutagenic repair, and enabling radiation and cisplatin treatment resistance.",Excluded,0.086719744

The purpose of the study is to measure 3D RA radiation dose as compared with biplanar digital subtraction angiography (DSA). METHOD(S): The distribution and peak skin dose were measured for 3D RA and biplanar DSA by using an anthropomorphic skull phantom. In addition, the cumulative incident dose, summed over all images in each acquisition, was determined. Measurements were acquired for our facility's standard 3D RA acquisition mode (25 degrees /s rotational speed; 162 total frames) and other available acquisition mode selections. RESULT(S): For 3D RA, the skin dose was found to be distributed across the back and sides of the skull with the peak skin dose located at the center of the back of the skull. The peak skin dose for the standard 3D RA acquisition mode was 15 mGy. For a biplanar DSA run, the peak skin dose was 58 mGy, also located at the back of the skull. The cumulative incident dose for the standard 3D RA acquisition mode was 33 mGy, compared with 53 mGy for biplanar DSA.

3829,"The centrosomal, putative tumor suppressor protein TACC2 is dispensable for normal development, and deficiency does not lead to cancer TACC2 is a member of the transforming acidic coiled-coil-containing protein family and is associated with the centrosome-spindle apparatus during cell cycling. In vivo, the TACC2 gene is expressed in various splice forms predominantly in postmitotic tissues, including heart, muscle, kidney, and brain. Studies of human breast cancer samples and cell lines suggest a putative role of TACC2 as a tumor suppressor protein. To analyze the physiological role of TACC2, we generated mice lacking TACC2. TACC2-deficient mice are viable, develop normally, are fertile, and lack phenotypic changes compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, TACC2 deficiency does not lead to an increased incidence of tumor development. Finally, in TACC2-deficient embryonic fibroblasts, proliferation and cell cycle progression as well as centrosome numbers are comparable to those in wild-type cells. Therefore, TACC2 is not required, nonredundantly, for mouse development and normal cell proliferation and is not a tumor suppressor protein.",Excluded,0.086695865

3831,"Correlating radiographical and pathological response to immunotherapy in primary brain tumors Objective: The radiographic response of primary brain tumors to immunotherapy is poorly understood. This study investigates the imaging and pathological characteristics of primary brain tumors after exposure to immunotherapy. Background(s): Immunotherapy amplifies the innate immune response to solid cancers. For example, inhibitors of immune checkpoints PD-1 and CTLA-4 block signals to inhibitory T cells, thus increasing the T-cell mediated response to non-self antigens. In prior studies, a subset of systemic cancers treated with immunotherapy demonstrate radiographic worsening prior to pathological/clinical response to treatment. While this phenomenon of ""pseudo-progression"" has been described in primary brain tumors after temozolomide and radiation, the radiographic response to immunotherapy is poorly characterized. Design/Methods: Inclusion criteria are 1) primary brain cancer diagnosis, 2) second resection, and 3) use of immunotherapy prior to re-resection. ""Immunotherapy"" includes PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors, or dendritic cell vaccines. Patients can utilize other chemotherapies and/or tumor treating fields, concurrently. Radiographical response on MRI is defined by RANO (Response Assessment in Neuro- Oncology) criteria. Pathological diagnosis is defined by WHO criteria. Result(s): At our center, 90 patients with primary brain cancers received immunotherapy during the course of cancer treatment. 10 of these patients (9 glioblastoma and 1 anaplastic astrocytoma) had re-resection after initiation of immunotherapy, with radiographical progression at 0.6-9.6 months, and repeat resection at 0.7-12.6 months. Of the 10 patients, resection pathology was characterized as predominantly treatment effect in 4 patients, and predominantly recurrent tumor in 6 patients. Further analysis will be done to characterize the molecular and genetic characteristics of resection tissue. Conclusion(s): Given promise in other cancer fields, immunotherapy is becoming increasingly popular in the treatment of primary brain cancer. In this limited case series, 4 out of 10 patients treated with immunotherapy had radiographic progression without significant pathologic progression. This suggests that immunotherapy may be continued past radiographic progression.",Excluded,0.09254133
3832,"Effects of ionizing radiation on brain metastasis-associated inflammation and its implication for immunotherapy Brain metastases represent the most common intracranial tumor in adults associated with poor prognosis and median survival of only a few months. Despite current success in the development of targeted or immunotherapies against different cancer entities, those strategies are ineffective against brain metastases. Hence, treatment options for brain metastasis patients largely remain limited to surgical resection and radioand/ or chemotherapy. This paucity can in part be attributed to the immune-privileged status of the brain where the blood brain-barrier restricts the entry of blood-borne immune cells. However, recent insights into the immune landscape of primary brain cancers indicate that tumor progression leads to an infiltration of blood-borne immune cells into the brain. We employ a comprehensive set of experimental brain metastasis models to characterize the immune landscape of brain metastases from different primary cancer entities at distinct disease stages and in response to radiotherapy. Our data indicate that brain metastases induce massive infiltration of myeloid and lymphoid cell populations into the central nervous system. This leads to the establishment of a dynamic and highly complex tumor microenvironment that affects tumor progression and therapy response. Fractionated whole-brain radiotherapy leads to enhanced infiltration of blood-borne myeloid and lymphoid cells. Transcriptome analysis of brain-resident and recruited myeloid cells indicate a switch from a proinflammatory towards an immune-suppressive environment at advanced disease stages. Importantly, radiotherapy was found to induce gene signatures that are associated with proinflammatory innate immune responses that could revert the establishment of an immune-suppressive environment. Consequently, radiotherapy might sensitize brain metastases towards immunotherapies. Our goal is to identify pathways or molecular targets that are induced by radiotherapy in the tumor microenvironment to overcome resistance against immunotherapy. In this project, we seek to test strategies to maintain or induce proinflammatory immune responses for improved targeted or immunotherapies against brain metastasis.",Excluded,0.18195431
3833,"Unusual acute and delayed skin reactions during and after whole-brain radiotherapy in combination with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. Two case reports BACKGROUND: Besides radiotherapy (RT) and surgery, the introduction of BRAF inhibitors like vemurafenib has provided new opportunities for treatment of patients with metastasized malignant melanomas. RT and vemurafenib are being increasingly used concurrently, although little is known about the potential side effects of this combination. Vemurafenib is known to cause severe cutaneous skin reactions such as phototoxicity and evidence is accumulating that RT may further enhance these side effects.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report two cases of unusual skin reactions occurring during and after treatment with a combination of vemurafenib and whole-brain irradiation in patients with cerebral metastases arising from malignant melanomas.RESULTS: One case report describes excessive acute radiodermatitis which arose during whole-brain irradiation in combination with vemurafenib. The second describes a late skin reaction occurring approximately 30 days after completion of RT.CONCLUSION: These two case reports show that combination of both treatment modalities is possible, but requires close monitoring of patients and good interdisciplinary collaboration.",Excluded,0.08633895

This study, adapted a previously reported nanoparticle-directed photothermal treatment of brain tumors to the treatment of prostate disease by using normal canine prostate in vivo, directly injected with a suspension of nanoparticles as a proxy for prostate tumor, and by developing laser dosimetry for prostate which is marginally ablative in native tissue, yet producing photothermal coagulation in prostate tissue containing nanoparticles.METHODS: Canine prostates were exposed by surgical laparotomy and directly injected with suspensions of nanoparticles (nanoshells) and irradiated by a NIR laser source delivered percutaneously by an optical fiber catheter and isotropic diffuser. The photothermal lesions were permitted to resolve for up to 8 days, at which time each animal was euthanized, necropsied, and the prostate taken for histopathological and elemental analysis.RESULTS: Nanoparticles were retained for up to 4 hours in prostate and served as a proxy for prostate tumor. A marginally ablative laser dose of 3.0 W for 3 minutes was developed which would yield 4 mm-radius coagulo-necrotic lesions if nanoparticles were present.CONCLUSION: We have shown that the addition of nanoshells to native tissue, combined with a marginally ablative laser dose can generate ablative thermal lesions, and that the radial extent of the thermal lesions is strictly confined to within ~4 mm of the optical fiber with sub-millimeter uncertainty. This, in turn, suggests a means of precise tumor ablation with an ability to obviate damage to critical structures limited primarily by the precision with which the optical fiber applicator can be placed. In so doing, it should be possible to realize a precise, nerve bundle and urethra sparing prostate cancer treatment using a minimally invasive, percutaneous approach.",Excluded,0.08583718
3836,"Epidemiology and molecular pathology of glioma Gliomas account for almost 80% of primary malignant brain tumors, and they result in more years of life lost than do any other tumors. Glioblastoma, the most common type of glioma, is associated with very poor survival, so glioma epidemiology has focused on identifying factors that can be modified to prevent this disease. Only two relatively rare factors have so far been conclusively shown to affect glioma risk--exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation, and inherited mutations of highly penetrant genes associated with rare syndromes. In addition, preliminary evidence points to a lower glioma risk among people with allergic conditions and high levels of serum IgE. Recent research has focused on identifying germline polymorphisms associated with risk of glioma, and using molecular markers to classify glial tumors into more-homogenous groups. Because gene products probably interact with environmental factors or developmental signals to produce gliomas, large studies are needed to analyze associations between polymorphisms and glioma. Cohort studies of immune factors and glioma risk are being undertaken to validate the results of case-control studies. Studies of polymorphisms of genetic pathways with strong prior hypotheses are being planned, and whole-genome scans are being proposed to study high-risk families and case-control series. The Brain Tumor Epidemiology Consortium has been formed to co-ordinate these studies. [References: 69]",Excluded,0.09014013

3838,"Modulation of acute coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis in gamma-irradiated rats by transfer of naive lymphocyte subsets before infection Clinical course, recovery of infectious virus from brain tissue and histopathology of the central nervous system were examined in gamma-irradiated Lewis rats reconstituted by naive lymphocytes before infection with coronavirus MHV-4 (strain JHM). Up to 9 days past infection, no differences were seen between immunologically competent and immuno-deficient animals in terms of onset and progression of neurological disease. However, in the latter animals neurological symptoms were dominated by signs of encephalitis instead of paralytic disease as usually seen in immunocompetent animals. Nevertheless, despite high titers of infectious virus in the CNS of immunodeficient animals only mild histopathological changes were noticeable. In contrast, infectious virus in the CNS of immunologically competent animals was below the detection limit of the assay. Paralytic disease and tissue destruction were T lymphocyte mediated because gamma-irradiated rats that were reconstituted by CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocyte enriched cells in the absence of B lymphocytes revealed an earlier onset of clinical symptoms and a more rapid deterioration of their clinical state compared to fully competent animals. Whereas in CD4+ T cell reconstituted animals infectious virus was moderately reduced and tissue destruction as well as inflammatory changes in the CNS were focal, in CD8+ T cell reconstituted animals vacuolizing white matter inflammation was diffuse without reduction of infectious virus in brain tissue. From the presented data we conclude that in the acute stage of JHMV-induced encephalomyelitis of Lewis rats: (i) tissue destruction and paralytic clinical symptomatology are mainly T cell-mediated; (ii) CD4+ T lymphocytes can directly contribute to reduction of viral load in the brain and (iii) only coordinated action of both, the T and the B cell compartment enables animals to survive the infection and recover from disease.",Excluded,0.89829785
3839,"Lipoic and dihydrolipoic acids as antioxidants. A critical evaluation A detailed evaluation of the antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties of lipoic acid (LA) and dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) was performed. Both compounds are powerful scavengers of hypochlorous acid, able to protect alpha 1-antiproteinase against inactivation by HOCl. LA was a powerful scavenger of hydroxyl radicals (OH.) and could inhibit both iron-dependent OH. generation and peroxidation of ox-brain phospholipid liposomes in the presence of FeCl3-ascorbate, presumably by binding iron ions and rendering them redox-inactive. By contrast, DHLA accelerated iron-dependent OH. generation and lipid peroxidation, probably by reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+. LA inhibited this pro-oxidant action of DHLA. However, DHLA did not accelerate DNA degradation by a ferric bleomycin complex and slightly inhibited peroxidation of arachidonic acid by the myoglobin-H2O2 system. Under certain circumstances, DHLA accelerated the loss of activity of alpha-antiproteinase exposed to ionizing radiation under a N2O/O2 atmosphere and also the loss of creatine kinase activity in human plasma exposed to gas-phase cigarette smoke. Neither LA nor DHLA reacted with superoxide radical (O.2-) or H2O2 at significant rates, but both were good scavengers of trichloromethylperoxyl radical (CCl3O2.). We conclude that LA and DHLA have powerful antioxidant properties. However, DHLA can also exert pro-oxidant properties, both by its iron ion-reducing ability and probably by its ability to generate reactive sulphur-containing radicals that can damage certain proteins, such as alpha 1-antiproteinase and creatine kinase.",Excluded,0.08592028

This approach creates a regression tree according to prognostic variables which partitions into homogenous subsets according to survival. Four protocols, RTOG 83-11, 83-21, 84-03 and 84-07 were analyzed. 83-11 and 84-07 were studies utilizing irradiation with 'alterfractionation; 83-21 and 84-03 were studies evaluating thymocin with irradiation and prophylactic cranial irradiation with thoracic irradiation respectively. Nine pretreatment variables and one treatment variable were analyzed. Adjustment for radiotherapy effect was made in the accelerated treatment protocol (84-07). Overall, median survival for the entire group was 9.0 months with 17% alive at 2 years. Univariate analysis suggests that KPS, <=70 vs. 80-100, pleural effusion, weight loss, <=5% vs. 5%, age, 60 + vs. < 60, T stage (T1 and T2 vs. T3 and T4) and N stage (N- vs. N +) were important prognastic factors. Radiation dose, sex, race and histology were not univariate prognastic factors. RPA identified KPS as the most significant covariate (median survival 5.9 mos. <= 70 vs. 9.9 mos. 80-100). Within KPS 80-100 other splits occurred for N stage, age, weight loss and radiation therapy dose. KPS 170 split at pleural effusion only. The best overall RPA tree has four distinct classes with median survival times ranging from 3.3 to 12.6 months. The RPA classes were validated in an independent non-small cell lung cancer dataset.

3841,"Missense mutations but not allelic variants alter the function of ATM by dominant interference in patients with breast cancer The human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is characterized by hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and an elevated risk of malignancy. Epidemiological data support an increased risk for breast and other cancers in A-T heterozygotes. However, screening breast cancer cases for truncating mutations in the ATM (A-T mutated) gene has failed largely to reveal an increased incidence in these patients. It has been hypothesized that ATM missense mutations are implicated in breast cancer, and there is some evidence to support this. The presence of a large variety of rare missense variants in addition to common polymorphisms in ATM makes it difficult to establish such a relationship by association studies. To investigate the functional significance of these changes we have introduced missense substitutions, identified in either A-T or breast cancer patients, into ATM cDNA before establishing stable cell lines to determine their effect on ATM function. Pathogenic missense mutations and neutral missense variants were distinguished initially by their capacity to correct the radiosensitive phenotype in A-T cells. Furthermore missense mutations abolished the radiation-induced kinase activity of ATM in normal control cells, caused chromosome instability, and reduced cell viability in irradiated control cells, whereas neutral variants failed to do so. Mutant ATM was expressed at the same level as endogenous protein, and interference with normal ATM function seemed to be by multimerization. This approach represents a means of identifying genuine ATM mutations and addressing the significance of missense changes in the ATM gene in a variety of cancers including breast cancer.",Excluded,0.086088575
3842,"High resolution dual-tracer brain SPECT with a new highperformance CdTe detector Aims: Simultaneous dual-tracer brain imaging has the potential to shorten patient pathways in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, but the poor spectral resolution of conventional gamma cameras limits the utility of this technique. Solid state detectors offer improved capability to distinguish between two radioisotopes, and this has been exploited clinically in the field of nuclear cardiology. However, the technology has yet to be fully evaluated in the field of scintigraphic neuroimaging. We present imaging results for a new small-pixel CdTe detector in simultaneous dual-radioisotope scintigraphy of a brain phantom. Method(s): We have developed a new high-performance CdTe detector with an array of 80x80 pixels on a 250mum pitch, capable of imaging x-rays and gamma rays up to 200keV. The detector is fully spectroscopic, recording the energy of every interaction in each pixel of the detector, and the small pixel size affords very high spatial- and spectral- resolution. The detector has a wide range of applications in medical imaging, including x-ray diffraction tomography, x-ray k-edge subtraction and highresolution nuclear medicine imaging. The new detector has been characterised for radionuclide imaging. Using pinhole collimation, images have been acquired of a brain phantom containing both I-123 and Tc-99m. The hyperspectral dataset was subjected to corrections for inter-pixel charge sharing, variations in energy and uniformity response, and bad pixel interpolation. Images were created by applying energy windows to the spectral data. Images and spectra of the same phantom were also acquired with a conventional clinical gamma camera for comparison. For each image, the contrast and cross-talk between the two energy windows were quantified using regions of interest. Result(s): The CdTe system exhibits improved scatter rejection and greatly reduced cross-talk between the energy windows for the two radioisotopes, resulting in enhanced image contrast. These characteristics will allow for better accuracy for quantitative imaging in a dual-tracer setting, which has particular importance in brain imaging. We also demonstrate the ability of the detector to resolve low-energy fluorescence x-rays from the radioactive source. The system has a high efficiency for detection of these low-energy photons, and incorporating these events into image reconstruction may boost the sensitivity, reducing image noise. Conclusion(s): Small-pixel CdTe detectors are a promising prospect in multi-tracer SPECT imaging. We present future plans to develop the instrument, with a tiled array of detectors with minimal dead-space to increase the field of view and improved collimators to further increase the sensitivity of the system.",Excluded,0.085896164

Herein we describe the case of a 65-year-old man who sought rehabilitation services for left groin pain following a period of intense trekking and uphill walking. He presented with left hip flexor weakness and local tenderness over the left iliopsoas tendon with negative findings on neurological evaluation. Additionally, he presented with left hip capsule and hip flexor tightness with left gluteus maximus and gluteus medius weakness. The left hip capsule tightness was predominantly in the posterior fibres, with restriction of hip internal rotation. The clinical picture overall was suggestive of the presence of risk parameters for iliopsoas tendinopathy. Plain radiographs of the hip revealed mild degenerative changes with a mild pincer impingement. While his clinical and radiological picture was suggestive of degenerative and soft tissue pathology of the hip, a real-time sonographic study was useful in the quantitative confirmation of a partial tear of the left iliopsoas tendon. Additionally, a repeat sonographic study performed four weeks later, revealed a healing iliopsoas tendon seen as a decrease in the width of the hypoechoic presentation of the tear.

3846,"Pre-operative meningioma embolization with ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer Introduction The benefit of pre-operative embolization of meningioma and hemangiopericytoma continues to be debated. Several large cohort studies of 80-198 patients have reported complication rates of 2.5% to 9% using particles or n-butyl cyanoacrylate (nBCA).[1-5] However, although a recent national registry of 898 patients found an association between liquid embolysate and complication rates, with an odds ratio of 3.9.[6] Endovascular technology continues to evolve and ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH or Onyx Medtronic) has been available for embolization of arteriovenous malformations for over a decade. The off-label use of EVOH for pre-operative embolization of meningiomas or hemangiopericytomas has only been reported in small series. This study reviewed the safety profile and embolization duration of our experience with EVOH embolization. Methods Review of institutional records identified 72 consecutive cases of meningiomas and hemangiopericytomas that underwent pre-operative embolization with EVOH prior to surgical resection from 2007 to 2017. The imaging and medical records were reviewed to identify tumor dimensions, vascular pedicles, endovascular equipment, outcomes and complications. Embolization rate was compared with Wilcox signed-rank test and complication rates were compared using the Fisher exact test. Results The tumors measured 5 cm (IQR 4.4-6.3) or 45 cm<sup>3</sup> (23-71) and were located on the convexity (26%), tentorium (22%), falx (20%), sphenoid ridge (15%), petrous (5%), anterior cranial fossa (5%), infratemporal fossa (4%), and middle cranial fossa (3%). The most frequent pedicle embolized was a middle meningeal artery. In 83% of cases, this was the first pedicle embolized and in 24% of cases, an additional MMA catheterization was used for embolization. Additional pedicles included the internal maxillary (8), occipital artery (7), superficial temporal (4), posterior meningeal (2), posterior auricular (1), and ascending pharyngeal (1) arteries. Tumor supply from branches of the internal carotid artery were typically not embolized: anterior cerebral branches (3 embolized: 7 not embolized), middle cerebral branches (0:11), ophthalmic branches (0:11). In 7 cases, nBCA was also used, most commonly in the superior cerebellar artery (3:7). Abstract O-033 Table 1 Tumor embolization characteristics VIEW INLINE VIEW POPUP There were symptomatic complications from embolization in 8% of cases. Twice, tumor necrosis and edema required earlier craniotomy and tumor evacuation, and four patients had new neurologic deficit from infarct. Two occurred from reflux and two occurred from embolysate migration across the tumor to pial vessels. The complication rate was not different from studies in meningiomas with 75 or more cases using other embolysates (p-value 0.15-1.0). In power analysis, comparison against previously published studies would distinguish a complication rate of 23% in a series of this size. Conclusion Embolization with EVOH is comparable in safety to other embolization techniques in meningioma or hemangiopericytoma. Similar to what has been described in arteriovenous malformations, simultaneous dual catheter embolization may decrease procedural time and radiation exposure.",Excluded,0.08615523
3847,"Empirical vs risk-based approach to intracavernosal injection therapy: A prospective study Objectives: Intracavernosal injection (ICI) therapy is widely used for ED. Employing it in practice is largely empirical and has not been validated with evidence-based approaches. This study compares two strategies for ICI to determine whether a risk-based approach is more efficacious, increases satisfaction and/or results in fewer treatment complications. Method(s): After obtaining IRB approval, a prospective database of patients enrolled in the ICI program at the Johns Hopkins Hospital from May 2012-present was amassed. Demographic information, treatment outcomes and subjective patient evaluations of sexual function (IIEF, QEQ, SQoL and EDITS questionnaires) were obtained at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Two approaches were compared. Group 1 consisted of empiric ICI treatment. Patients were treated with Prostaglandin E1 10 mcg, irrespective of ED etiology or severity, and only if poor response noted at test injection, then initiated on bimix or trimix. Group 2 was a risk-based approach, where using an algorithm that factored in: organic vs. neurogenic ED, number of ED risk factors, prostatectomy, nerve-sparing status, time from surgery and radiation status, patients were treated with either bimix, low- or high-dose trimix. Dose titration was permitted in both groups. Statistical analysis was carried out using t-test and chi-squared analysis.

He was treated with chemoradiation 6 months prior to current admission. Follow up imaging after chemoradiation showed progressive disease. He was then started on palliative cetuximab 1 month prior to current admission. During current admission, work up for syncope was commenced. EKG and cardiac enzymes were negative. There were no events on telemetry. Review of his last CT scan from 4 months prior to admission showed encasement of left carotid artery. A repeat CT scan of his neck was performed. It showed remarkable tumor progression with extensive lymphadenopathy and compression of both of his carotid arteries by a combination of tumor burden, lymph nodes and post-radiation edema. Surgical resection of the mass and local radiation therapy were both deemed inappropriate due to location of tumor and its relative radioresistance in the past. In addition, there was concern that radiation could cause worsening edema and precipitous worsening of patient's condition by causing complete occlusion of the carotid arteries. This information was discussed with patient and his wife and he is currently in home hospice. In the 2 weeks since discharge, he feels he has been able to minimize further episodes of syncope by limiting and modifying his activities. DISCUSSION: Recurrent syncope due to malignancy is uncommon. Head and neck cancer can lead to recurrent syncope by two mechanisms. Neurally mediated syncope can occur due to carotid body invasion or involvement of the vagus nerve. Syncope due to reduced blood flow in carotid arteries is uncommon and requires involvement of both carotids. While it is possible that our patient was passing out due to tumor pressure mediated firing of baroreceptors in his carotid bodies, we think reduced carotid blood flow was the more likely culprit. This is based upon the fact that he only started having syncopal events after involvement of his contralateral carotid artery. Finally, our case highlights the importance of imaging the carotid arteries in patients with history of head and neck cancer who present with syncope. Imaging of carotid arteries is not merited during routine diagnostic work up of syncope unless a neurological event is suggested by history or if focal signs and symptoms are present. However, such an evaluation should be considered in patients who have a history of head and neck cancer, especially if the cancer has been relatively resistant to treatment or locally advanced in the past.",Excluded,0.086461164
3849,"Changes in olfactory inputs modify the energy balance response to short days in male gray mouse lemurs The role of olfaction/olfactory cues on photoperiodic responses was assessed in Malagasy primate, the gray mouse lemur. When exposed to short photoperiod (SP), this primate demonstrates rapid changes in energy balance as adaptive anticipatory response for winter survival. To follow early changes induced by SP exposure, body mass, food intake, resting metabolism (RMR) and free thyroxin levels in plasma (T4) were measured in males abruptly transferred to SP: six intact males (controls), eight males that underwent bilateral olfactory removal (BOX) and eight males exposed to male urinary cues (U-exposed). To assess the effect of SP exposure, two other groups were maintained for 6 weeks under LP: six controls and six BOX males. Whereas all studied parameters remained constant in controls and BOX males maintained under LP, exposure to SP led to different responses according to groups. In controls, SP exposure led to a regular increase in body mass and after 4 weeks under SP, plasma T4 levels, food consumption and RMR significantly decreased. Even if BOX males demonstrated hyperphagic patterns regardless of the photoperiod, an increase in body mass was also induced by SP exposure but without changes in RMR or food intake that were body mass-dependent. In U-exposed males, body mass gain was significantly reduced while food intake and RMR remained high. In both BOX and U-exposed males, SP exposure led to a transient but high increase in T4 levels compared to controls. These results suggest that olfaction/olfactory cues may delay the SP-mediated changes in energy balance.",Excluded,0.0882547

Semiautomated software was used to segment anatomic regions of the cerebral cortex for each patient. Cortical thickness was measured for each region before RT and 1 year afterward. Two higher-order cortical regions of interest (ROIs) were tested for association between radiation dose and cortical thinning: entorhinal (memory) and inferior parietal (attention/memory). For comparison, 2 primary cortex ROIs were also tested: pericalcarine (vision) and paracentral lobule (somatosensory/motor). Linear mixed-effects analyses were used to test all other cortical regions for significant radiation dose-dependent thickness change. Statistical significance was set at alpha = 0.05 using 2-tailed tests.RESULTS: Cortical atrophy was significantly associated with radiation dose in the entorhinal (P=.01) and inferior parietal ROIs (P=.02). By contrast, no significant radiation dose-dependent effect was found in the primary cortex ROIs (pericalcarine and paracentral lobule). In the whole-cortex analysis, 9 regions showed significant radiation dose-dependent atrophy, including areas responsible for memory, attention, and executive function (P<=.002).CONCLUSIONS: Areas of cerebral cortex important for higher-order cognition may be most vulnerable to radiation-related atrophy. This is consistent with clinical observations that brain radiation patients experience deficits in domains of memory, executive function, and attention. Correlations of regional cortical atrophy with domain-specific cognitive functioning in prospective trials are warranted.",Excluded,0.98221016
3851,"Intraoperative radiation therapy for metastatic spinal tumors STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective examination of 37 patients with metastatic spinal tumors treated with intraoperative radiation therapy.OBJECTIVE: To propose a new technique for local control of metastatic spinal tumors.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: No reports of intraoperative radiation therapy for metastatic spinal tumors have been published as of the time of this writing.METHODS: Between December 1992 and April 1996, intraoperative radiation therapy was performed in 37 patients with spinal metastasis. In all but one patient, the spinal cord was protected during intraoperative radiation therapy by a lead shield to prevent radiation myelopathy. In addition to intraoperative radiation therapy, 22 of the 37 patients received external radiation therapy, either before or after their operation. Although the authors had recommended a dose of approximately 30 Gy of external radiation therapy after wound suture removal to patients who did not receive preoperative radiation therapy, the remaining 15 patients did not receive external radiation therapy, either by choice or because they received alternative therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy for various cancers was administered to 9 of the 37 patients, including 4 of the aforementioned 15.RESULTS: All patients attained clinical improvement in pain, neurologic function status, or both, with no evidence of local recurrence. Radiation myelopathy developed in the one patient whose spinal cord was not protected during intraoperative radiation therapy. Eleven patients experienced metastasis in vertebrae that were not surgically treated.CONCLUSION: Intraoperative radiation therapy appears to achieve good palliation and may be useful for local control of spinal metastases.",Excluded,0.18071778
3852,"The radiation exposure of the patient from stable-xenon computed tomography For stable-xenon computed tomography (CT), an X-ray examination for measurement of cerebral blood circulation in the brain, the radiation exposure of the patient was determined in order to estimate the risk of inducing cancer. Organ doses of brain, eyelenses, thyroid and gonads have been calculated using the measured air kerma free-in-air on the axis of rotation and organ-specific conversion factors calculated with the Monte Carlo method. Dose measurements with TLD-100 rods using a humanoid Alderson phantom were carried out for verification of the calculated organ doses. In the case of brain partially located in the region of primary radiation a mean organ dose of 39 mSv was calculated. The dose measurements showed dose equivalents between 6 and 68 mSv in different regions of the brain and consequently an inhomogeneous dose distribution. From an estimation of the radiation-induced risk using the effective dose of 1.6 mSv it follows that one additional fatal cancer per 12,500 stable-xenon CT examinations has to be expected. The organ doses of eyelenses and thyroid located in the region of scattered radiation are so low that biological effects are hardly to be expected. The calculated dose equivalents of 6.5 mSv and 0.5 mSv, respectively, are in good agreement with measurements. The organ dose of gonads amounted to less than 0.07 mSv.",Excluded,0.086268105

However, the functional significance of these polymorphic variants in altering cell processes such as cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, and apoptosis is uncertain. We have cloned the XPD variants Lys751Gln, Asp312Asn, and Lys751Gln-Asp312Asn into a pcDNA-3.1-expression vector. Using these constructs, we did not find any detectable difference in either in vitro binding with wild-type p53 or in DNA repair proficiency as measured by host cell reactivation assay. We then genotyped 34 different lymphoblastoid cell lines from six Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humaine (CEPH)/Utah pedigree families and a CEPH/French pedigree family for polymorphisms at codons 751 and 312 and assessed their apoptotic response after either UV or ionized radiation exposure. The lymphoblastoid cell lines with homozygous or heterozygous Asp at codon 312 have similar apoptotic rates, whereas cell lines with homozygous Asn at codon 312 showed a 2.5-fold increased response to UV (P = 0.005; Student's t test). This is the first report known to us of a functional polymorphism in a gene involved in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. However, the presence of Lys or Gln at codon 751 did not influence the apoptotic response to UV. The diminished apoptotic response of cells containing the 312 Asp allele could both allow the survival and selective clonal expansion of carcinogen-damaged cells and be a mechanistic explanation for the increased risk of cancer at diverse tissue sites.",Excluded,0.086367205

3856,"Phase I trial of escalated doses of targeted marrow/lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) delivered by tomotherapy combined with etoposide and cyclophosphamide; an allogeneic HCT preparative regimen for patients with refractory leukemia Introduction: The overall survival (OS) for relapsed (RL) acute leukemia patients or those considered induction failure (IF) treated with HCT is 16-19% (Duval et al., JCO 2010). While randomized studies have shown a dose response relationship, with higher doses of radiation resulting in decreased relapse, this benefit is off set by increased treatment related mortality. Materials (or patients) and Methods: To explore the safety and tolerability of targeted radiation treatment in the context of HCT, a phase I trial is being conducted in which escalated doses of targeted whole body radiation is delivered to marrow bearing and lymphoid areas, while sparing non hematopoietic (vital) organs. The transplant preparative regimen is as follows: TMLI on days -10 to -6; etoposide 60mg/kg [adj bw] on day -5 with cyclophosphamide 100mg/kg [ideal bw] on day -3. The radiation dose was started at 1200cGy delivered in 150 cGy fractions twice a day. Initially the dose of radiation was escalated in increments of 150 cGy to 1500 cGy using standard 3x3 design and then 100 cGy incrementally to a maximum of 2000 cGy using rolling 6 design. Dose limiting toxicity is defined according to the Bearman and CTCAE 3.0 (for hematologic toxicity) scales. Liver and brain dose was kept at 1200 cGy. Median normal organs received 16-60% of the marrow dose (lung 44%, esophagus 33% and oral cavity 28%). All patients received peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and sirolimus. Result(s): To date, a total of 41 patients have been transplanted; from 3/14/2008 to 10/3/2013. Patient characteristics: AML n=27, ALL Ph- n=10, ALL Ph+ n=2, Biphenotypic n=2; disease status at HCT, 1RL n=13, 2RL n=2, IF n=26; cytogenetic risk(SWOG criteria): intermediate n=19, unfavorable n=15 and unknown significance n=7 median KPS at HCT 90 (60-100); donor source sibling n=20, HLA matched unrelated n=5, mismatched (1 allele) unrelated n=16; WBC at HCT median 1.5 (0.1-14.9) % blasts (blood) at HCT median 2% (0-85%) % blasts (marrow) at HCT median 46% (10-90%) Two patients presented with extramedullary disease at time of HCT. With a median follow-up for alive patients of 9.9 months (1.0- 53.4), the OS and cumulative incidence of relapse/progression at 1 year are 52% (95%CI: 32.9-68.1) and 45% (95%CI: 30.9-65.5) respectively. Two patients are currently being treated at 1900 cGy dose, MTD has not been declared. All patients treated at >= 1700 cGy achieved CR at the day 30 post transplant evaluation. Twenty (49%) of patients developed acute GvHD; 6(30%) of these developed grades 3-4. The day 30 and day 100 NRM was 0% and 5.3% respectively. The most common toxicity across the dose levels tested is grade 1 GI and grade 2 stomatitis (Bearman Scale). Causes of death were disease progression/persistent disease n=14, GvHD n=1 and infection n=1. Discussion(s): These results are encouraging and suggest that 1) doses of TMLI can be safely escalated to 1800 cGy in combination with etoposide and cyclophosphamide (MTD not reached, dose escalation will continue to 2000 cGy); 2) all patients treated with >=1700 cGy achieved a CR at the day 30 evaluation and that 3) a reduction in relapse/progression compared to published reports can be achieved without increasing NRM using targeted whole body radiation in this high risk population.",Excluded,0.08675925

OBJECTIVE To report the methods and results of palladium-103 brachytherapy for American Joint Committee on Cancer, 7th edition, T3- and T4-sized choroidal melanomas. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective analysis of the results of a clinical case series over a 10-year period of 47 consecutive patients with uveal melanoma. The patients were treated at The New York Eye Cancer Center, Beth Israel Comprehensive Cancer Center, or The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary between 2002 and 2012 and had a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Tumors had a mean preoperative apical tumor height of 8.6mmand a mean largest basal diameter of 15.8 mm. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We analyzed, but were not limited to, data on the methods of radiation therapy, local tumor control, adverse effects, vision retention, and metastatic rate. RESULTS All patients completed therapy and received the prescribed tumor apex dose. At a median of 47 months (range, 6-125 months), the rate of local control was 91% and the rate of eye retention was 89%. The most common long-term brachytherapy-related complication was radiation maculopathy (66%of patients), followed by radiation optic neuropathy (51%of patients). One or both of these complications were diagnosed at a mean time of 16 months (range, 2-36 months) after brachytherapy. Secondary cataract developed in 36%of patients. Glaucoma developed in 17%of patients and resulted in enucleation in 4%of patients. The mean pretreatment visual acuity was 20/50 (range, 20/12.5 to hand motions), which evolved to a mean visual acuity of 20/100 (range, 20/20 to no light perception). Overall, 25 of 47 patients (53%) maintained 20/200 or better vision. Metastatic melanoma developed in 32% of patients.

The latter immunomodulator was found to show a 3-fold increase in splenic colony formation after incubation of bone marrow cells with rabbit antimouse brain serum (RAMBS). The former preparation failed to show the same action. Its effect was close to that of thymocytes. When the recipients exposed to lethal irradiation were administered the RAMBS-treated bone marrow cells and one of the peptides, it was shown that in concomitant administration, thymohexin and thymocytes lost their ability to restore colony formation by RAMBS-treated bone marrow. Thymogen did not suppress the stimulating activity of thymocytes. It is suggested that the differences observed between the tested peptides in their ability to recover colony formation were determined by their structure.",Excluded,0.08626165

The aim of this study was to determine the responses of the spinal cord dorsal horn neurons to stimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex (SSC). We hypothesized that direct stimulation of the SSC will inhibit the activity of spinal dorsal horn neurons by activating the descending inhibitory system. Thirty-four wide dynamic range spinal dorsal horn neurons were recorded in response to graded mechanical stimulation (brush, pressure, and pinch) at their respective receptive fields while a stepwise electrical stimulation (300 Hz, 0.1 ms, at 10, 20, and 30 V) was applied in the SSC through a bipolar tungsten electrode. The responses to brush at control, 10 V, 20 V, 30 V, and recovery were 16.0 +/- 2.3, 15.8 +/- 2.2, 14.6 +/- 1.8, 14.8 +/- 2.0, and 17.0 +/- 2.2 spikes/s, respectively. The responses to pressure at control, 10 V, 20 V, 30 V, and recovery were 44.7 +/- 5.5, 37.0 +/- 5.6, 29.5 +/- 4.8, 31.6 +/- 5.2, and 43.2 +/- 5.7 spikes/s, respectively. The responses to pinch at control, 10 V, 20 V, 30 V, and recovery were 58.1 +/- 7.0, 42.9 +/- 5.5, 34.8 +/- 3.9, 34.6 +/- 4.4, and 52.6 +/- 6.0 spikes/s, respectively. Significant decreases of the dorsal horn neuronal responses to pressure and pinch were observed during SSC stimulation.

The aims of this study were to evaluate [(11)C]MeS-IMPY uptake in nonhuman primate brain and to estimate radiation exposure from serial whole-body images. Eight PET studies were performed in rhesus monkeys to measure the brain uptake and washout of [(11)C]MeS-IMPY. Time-activity data were analyzed with one-tissue and two-tissue compartmental models using radiometabolite-corrected plasma input function. In addition, two whole-body PET scans were acquired for 120 min to determine the biodistribution of [(11)C]MeS-IMPY. Tomographic PET images were compressed into a single planar image to identify organs with the highest radiation exposures. Estimates of the absorbed dose of radiation were calculated using OLINDA 1.0. Injection of [(11)C]MeS-IMPY caused little change in pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and temperature. [(11)C]MeS-IMPY showed high standardized brain uptake values of approximately 500% and 600% between 2 and 3 min in cortical regions and the cerebellum, respectively. The brain uptake of [(11)C]MeS-IMPY was widespread and quite uniform across all cortical regions. Activity rapidly washed out of the brain, with 20% of peak activity remaining at 40 min. Thus, all brain regions showed minimal retention of radioactivity, consistent with these healthy young animals having negligible amyloid plaques. Regional brain activity fitted well into a one-tissue compartment model. The average volume of distribution in all brain regions was 7.66+/-2.14 ml/cm(3) (n=4). The organs with the highest radiation exposure (muSv/MBq) were the gallbladder wall (33.4), urinary bladder (17) and lungs (12.9), with a resulting effective dose of 4.9 microSv/MBq (18 mrem/mCi).

MATERIAL & METHODS: Fifty Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups; control (C), radiation-early period (1 week) (Rd-E), radiation-late period (10 weeks) (Rd-L), Rd-E and resveratrol (Rd-E-RVT) and Rd-L and resveratrol treatment (Rd-L-RVT). Irradiation was performed based on the localized prostate cancer treatment protocol as a total of 20Gy. Resveratrol was given 10mg/kg orally 1 week for Rd-E-RVT group and 10 weeks for Rd-L-RVT. At the end of the experiment, intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements were performed and rats were sacrificed for tissue collection. RESULT(S): Malondealdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and caspase-3 activities were increased in both early and late irradiation groups as the latter being more elevated. Resveratrol treatment reversed these parameters back to control levels in both Rd- E-RVT and Rd-L-RVT groups. Glutathione (GSH) levels were decreased in Rd-E and Rd-L groups and were reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment in both early and late periods. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activities, cyclic GMP (c-GMP) and nitric oxide (NO) levels were decreased in the early period of irradiation however this difference doesn't have statistical significance. These parameters were decreased significantly in Rd-L group and resveratrol treatment reversed these values back to control levels. Sirtuin-1 protein expression was similar in both Rd-E and Rd-E-RVT groups however the protein expression was decreased in the late radiation period which is reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment. Intracavernosal pressure measurements were performed only in the late period as erectile dysfunction is a late complication of irradiation. The ICP/MAP ratio was significantly decreased in Rd-L group and was significantly reversed back to control levels with RvT treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Resveratrol, due to its strong anti-oxidant effects, may be a potential candidate for the management of oxidative stress induced erectile dysfunction in patients undergoing pelvic irradiation, if supported with further clinical studies.

In the years 1993 and 2005, 37 and 36 patients, respectively, with head and neck cancer treated by the local departments of otorhinolaryngology and of radiotherapy were examined consecutively according to their aftercare appointments. Time points of radiotherapy treatment of the patients evaluated in 1993 varied from 1984 to 1993. The patients evaluated in 2005 had received radiotherapy between 1998 and 2005.

3866,"Palmitoylation is a prerequisite for dimerization-dependent raftophilicity of rhodopsin The visual photopigment rhodopsin (Rh) is a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) responsible for initiation of the phototransduction cascade in rod photoreceptors. Similar to other GPCRs, Rh can form dimers or even higher oligomers and tends to have a supramolecular organization that is likely important in the dim light response. Rh also exhibits high affinity for lipid rafts (i.e. raftophilicity) upon light-dependent binding with the cognate G protein transducin (G<sub>t</sub>), suggesting the presence of lipid raft-like domains in the retinal disk membrane and their importance in phototransduction. However, the relationship between Rh oligomerization and lipid rafts in the disk membrane remains to be explored. Given previous findings that G<sub>t</sub> binds to dimeric Rh and that Rh is posttranslationally modified with two highly raftophilic palmitoyl moieties, we hypothesized that Rh becomes raftophilic upon dimerization. Here, using biochemical assays, we found that Rh*-G<sub>t</sub> complexes in the detergent-resistant membrane are partially resistant to cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and that the Rh-to-G<sub>t</sub> stoichiometry in this methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-resistant complex is 2:1. Next, we found that IgG-mediated Rh-Rh cross-linking renders Rh highly raftophilic, supporting the premise that Rh becomes raftophilic upon dimerization. Rh depalmitoylation via reduction of thioester linkages blocked the translocation of IgG-cross-linked Rh to the detergent-resistant membrane, highlighting that the two palmitoyl moieties are important for the dimerization-dependent raftophilicity of Rh. These results indicate that palmitoylated GPCRs such as Rh can acquire raftophilicity upon G protein-stabilized dimerization and thereby organize receptor-cluster rafts by recruiting raftophilic lipids.",Excluded,0.085883476

Methods and Materials One hundred seventy-nine patients treated between 2011 and 2013 for VS RS and without trigeminal impairment before RS were included in a retrospective study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine predictors of TN among characteristics of the patients, the dosimetry, and the VS. Results There were 20 Koos grade 1, 99 grade 2, 57 grade 3, and 3 grade 4. Fourteen patients (7.8%) presented a transitory or permanent TN. Between the patients with and without TN after VS RS, there was no significant difference regarding dosimetry or VS volume itself. Significant differences (univariate analysis P<.05, Mann-Whitney test) were found for parameters related to the cisternal portion of the trigeminal nerve: total integrated dose, maximum dose, mean dose, volume of the Vth nerve (Vol<inf>v</inf>), and volume of the Vth nerve receiving at least 11 Gy (Vol<inf>Vcist>11Gy</inf>), but also for maximal dose to the Vth nerve nucleus and intra-axial portion (Dose max<inf>Vax</inf>).

However these benefits have not been validated in community-based cohorts. The objective is to assess the impact of early vs not-early PC among cancer decedents on the risk of receiving aggressive care (ED/hospitalization), supportive care (home care/physician home visit), or hospital death. Method(s): We took a retrospective cohort of Ontario decedents between 2004 and 2014. We identified those who were 'early' PC users (i.e. used a validated PC service between month 12-6 before death [exposure]). We used propensity score matching to identify a control group of 'not-early' PC users. We hard matched on age, sex, cancer type and stage. The propensity score included region, income, year, radiation, etc. Among those with InterRAI assessments in exposure period, we additionally controlled for health instability, and dependency, depression, cognitive performance, pain, and caregiver presence via propensity score. McNemar test used to examine differences between pairs. Result(s): 51,001 decedents received early PC vs 85,979 not-early PC (i.e. late or none). After matching among those with no interRAI assessments, we found 34,184 pairs of early and not-early PC users. Both groups had equal distributions of age, sex, cancer type (e.g. 25% lung cancer) and stage (e.g. 24% stage 3 or 4). Compared to not-early PC users, early PC users had a 10% lower absolute risk to die in hospital and have any aggressive care respectively and a 24% higher absolute risk to any receive supportive care. In a mutually exclusive cohort, matching among those with interRAI assessments, we identified 3,419 pairs of early and not-early PC users. Both groups had equal scores in health instability (e.g. 12% moderate-high CHESS score) and other interRAI scales. The outcome results were similar to the non-interRAI analysis. Conclusion(s): Using propensity score matching, decedents receiving early PC are likely to receive more supportive care and less aggressive care compared to not-early PC users. Our study uniquely focuses on a population receiving community palliative care. In a distinct sample using interRAI assessments, we control for several confounders previously unmeasured.

Rat 9L gliosarcomas implanted in nude mice brains were irradiated by MRT 13 days after tumor inoculation using two orthogonal arrays of equally spaced 28 planar microbeams (25 microm width, 211 microm spacing and dose 500 Gy). At 1, 7 and 14 days after MRT, apparent diffusion coefficient, blood volume and vessel size index were mapped by MRI. Mean survival time after tumor inoculation increased significantly between MRT-treated and untreated groups (23 and 28 days respectively, log-rank test, p < 0.0001). A significant increase of apparent diffusion coefficient was observed 24 h after MRT in irradiated tumors versus non-irradiated ones. In the untreated group, both tumor size and vessel size index increased significantly (from 7.6 +/- 2.2 to 19.2 +/- 4.0 mm(2) and +23%, respectively) between the 14th and the 21st day after tumor cell inoculation. During the same period, in the MRT-treated group, no difference in tumor size was observed. The vessel size index measured in the MRT-treated group increased significantly (+26%) between 14 and 28 days of tumor growth. We did not observe the significant difference in blood volume between the MRT-treated and untreated groups. MRT slows 9L tumor growth in a mouse brain but MRI results suggest that the increase in survival time after our MRT approach may be rather due to a cytoreduction than to early direct effects of ionizing radiation on tumor vessels. These results suggest that MRT parameters need to be optimized to further damage tumor vessels.",Excluded,0.9602957

She had four close family members with history of vascular events, including stroke or myocardial infarction, before the age of 50. She noticed vision problems in her left eye of acute onset. Her visual acuities were 10/10 OD and 1/10 OS with a left relative afferent pupillary defect. Bilateral funduscopic examination showed: narrowing and arteriolar sheathing, arteriovenous nipping, discrete perifoveal pigment changes, left optic disc atrophy. Without other neurological abnormalities. Humphrey perimetry: paracentral scotoma in OD; inferior cecocentral and upper arcuate scotomas in OS. Brain MRI: important periventricular and subcortical ischemic leukoencephalopathy, and multiple ischemic vascular lacunae. Additionally, several enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces were located mostly at external capsules and anterior temporo-polar regions. Result(s): The molecular study detected the mutation c.1672C>T(p.Arg558Cys) in heterozygosity in NOTCH3 gene. (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): CADASIL diagnosis was suspected taking into account family history and atypical imaging findings. Cerebral and retinal vessels share anatomical and physiological properties. The abnormalities of retina and optic nerve may be due to direct microvascular damage or due to trans-synaptic retrograde degeneration after injuries involving optic radiation. Although there are reports describing retinal and optic nerve changes in advanced stages of CADASIL, to our knowledge, this is the first case presenting initially as an ophthalmologic impairment.",Excluded,0.0861481
3871,"Local tumor progression treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery: Differences between patients with 2-4 versus 5-10 brain metastases based on an update of a multi-institutional prospective observational study (JLGK0901) OBJECTIVE The Japanese Leksell Gamma Knife (JLGK)0901 study proved the efficacy of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in patients with 5-10 brain metastases (BMs) as compared to those with 2-4, showing noninferiority in overall survival and other secondary endpoints. However, the difference in local tumor progression between patients with 2-4 and those with 5-10 BMs has not been sufficiently examined for this data set. Thus, the authors reappraised this issue, employing the updated JLGK0901 data set with detailed observation via enhanced MRI. They applied sophisticated statistical methods to analyze the data. METHODS This was a prospective observational study of 1194 patients harboring 1-10 BMs treated with GKRS alone. Patients were categorized into groups A (single BM, 455 cases), B (2-4 BMs, 531 cases), and C (5-10 BMs, 208 cases). Local tumor progression was defined as a 20% increase in the maximum diameter of the enhanced lesion as compared to its smallest documented maximum diameter on enhanced MRI. The authors compared cumulative incidence differences determined by competing risk analysis and also conducted propensity score matching. RESULTS Local tumor progression was observed in 212 patients (17.8% overall, groups A/B/C: 93/89/30 patients). Cumulative incidences of local tumor progression in groups A, B, and C were 15.2%, 10.6%, and 8.7% at 1 year after GKRS; 20.1%, 16.9%, and 13.5% at 3 years; and 21.4%, 17.4%, and not available at 5 years, respectively. There were no significant differences in local tumor progression between groups B and C. Local tumor progression was classified as tumor recurrence in 139 patients (groups A/B/C: 68/53/18 patients), radiation necrosis in 67 (24/31/12), and mixed/ undetermined lesions in 6 (1/5/0). There were no significant differences in tumor recurrence or radiation necrosis between groups B and C. Multivariate analysis using the Fine-Gray proportional hazards model revealed age < 65 years, neurological symptoms, tumor volume >= 1 cm<sup>3</sup>, and prescription dose < 22 Gy to be significant poor prognostic factors for local tumor progression. In the subset of 558 case-matched patients (186 in each group), there were no significant differences between groups B and C in local tumor progression, nor in tumor recurrence or radiation necrosis. CONCLUSIONS Local tumor progression incidences did not differ between groups B and C. This study proved that tumor progression after GKRS without whole-brain radiation therapy for patients with 5-10 BMs was satisfactorily treated with the doses prescribed according to the JLGK0901 study protocol and that results were not inferior to those in patients with a single or 2-4 BMs. Copyright Â© AANS 2020, except where prohibited by US copyright law.",Excluded,0.8483396

3873,"Correlation of toll-like receptor (TLR) and PD-1 pathways in central nervous system lymphoma: A clinicopathological study on outcomes Introduction:Most patients with central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL) have an inferior response to therapy compared with systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), in part possibly because 95% of CNSL are of activated B-cell (ABC) phenotype. Recent studies have revealed the genetic basis of pathways active in CNSL. Activated anti-apoptotic NFkappaB and B-cell receptor pathways are key to sustained cancer cell survival. Myeloid differentiation primaryresponse protein 88 (MYD88) is an adaptor protein that upon stimulation of TLR, mediates downstream activation of the NFkappaB pathway. The objective of this study is to examine the association of MYD88 mutation and PD-1/PD-L1 expression with clinical outcome and the overlap between PD-1/ PD-L1 expression and MYD88 L265P mutation in CNSL. Method(s):Twenty-two patients with CNSL on whom complete treatment records and tissue were available were included in our study following IRB approval. On a corresponding archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue block from each case, 10 5-um unstained slides for immunohistochemistry and a 10-50 um tissue curl for MYD88 DNA analysis by PCR were prepared. PAX5, CD3, CD68, PD-1 and PD-L1 immunostains were performed and evaluated by light microscopy by two of the authors blinded to the clinical data, including one hematopathologist. Extracted DNA was analyzed using allele-specific PCR designed to detect the common MYD88 gene mutation c.794T>C (p.L265P). DLBCL immunophenotype data, based on Hans algorithm was extracted from the pathology reports. Comparisons between two groups were analyzed using Chi-square and Student t tests. Kaplan Meier method was used to calculate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Log-rank test was used to determine the differences in survival. Pearson and Spearman's rho coefficients were calculated for correlation analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS.22 software. Result(s):The median age at diagnosis was 67 years (range 28-81). Thirteen patients were male (59%). Twelve patients had ECOG performance status of > 1. Median LDH at diagnosis was 190 U/L. Two patients with CNSL had HIV. Two patients had received prior solid-organ transplant. Seventeen patients received high-dose methotrexate-based therapy, and 9 received radiation. In terms of histopathology, 19 (86%) were of ABC subtype, all were CD20 positive, and 4 were EBV-positive, including both post-transplant cases. The median PFS of all patients was 6.52 months, and the OS was 12 months. Tumor content of the tissue sections was estimated from H&E and PAX-5 stains and showed 30-100% tumor areas, barring 3 cases with <20%. Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) content (CD3) was estimated as low (50%), moderate (36%) or high (14%). Tumor associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration (CD68) was estimated as 32% high, 59% moderate and 9% low. 32% of tumors had either PD-L1 or PD-1 expression; all 4 EBV-associated tumors were positive for PD-L1. In 68% of cases, TAMs were positive for PD-L1. TILs coexpressed PD-1 in all cases. MYD88 data was available for 21 patients and 15/21 (71%) were positive. Twenty patients were included in the survival analysis. There was no significant association of MYD88 mutational status or tumor PD-1/PD-L1 expression with PFS or OS. While no correlation was found between the tumor PD1/PD-L1 status and the degree of TAM infiltration, TIL infiltration or the baseline lymphocyte count, there was a negative correlation between MYD88 mutation and tumor PD-1/ PD-L1 (p=0.004;r =-0.623). Conclusion(s): The high prevalence of tumor PD-1/PD-L1 and MYD88 gene mutation are similar to previous reports, however, we found an inverse correlation between MYD88 mutation status and tumor PD-1/PD-L1 expression, not previously reported. This could be due to one pathway being dominant in the individual tumor or to down regulation of checkpoint molecules mediated by MYD88 and needs further exploration. The presence of either PD-1/PD-L1 or MYD88 mutation is associated with a poor prognosis. This study further supports the rational for trials with TLR/NFkB pathway inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitors that penetrate the blood brain barrier.",Excluded,0.16435315
3874,"Brain dysplasia evoked by gamma irradiation at different stages of prenatal development leads to different tonic and clonic seizure reactivity Rats with brain dysplasia evoked by interruption of different stages of prenatal neurogenesis show characteristic variations in susceptibility to seizures depending on the neurochemical specificity of pharmacological agents used to evoke seizures. To verify a discrepancy between the data obtained using different pharmacological models, neurochemically neutral electroshocks were applied here. To produce brain dysplasia of different degrees, pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to a single 1.0. Gy dose of gamma rays on gestation days 13, 15, 17 or 19. From the postnatal day 60, their male offspring (E13s, E15s, E17s and E19s, respectively) were subjected to 21 daily electrical stimulations to evoke seizures. Profiles of tonic and clonic reactivity to electrical stimulation significantly differed from those observed following pilocarpine or kainic acid administration. E17s showed minimal intensity of tonic but maximal of clonic responses. On the contrary, very high tonic and low clonic reactivity was observed in E13s and E15s. Periventricular nodular heterotopias (PNHs) were observed exclusively in E15s and E17s. Generally, the size of PNHs was correlated positively with susceptibility to tonic seizures but negatively with susceptibility to clonic seizures. Analogous correlations with the size of the neocortex were opposite. E13s and E19s had brains devoid PNHs but showed high tonic seizure susceptibility similar to that in E15s. It can therefore be concluded that PNHs modified the type of seizure reactivity from tonic to clonic, depending of their size, but the presence of PNHs was not necessary for the development of seizure susceptibility itself.

3876,"PCI-no What does prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) prevent in ED-SCLC? - Why isn't the presence of brain metastasis evaluated before performing PCI? Background: In a European trial, prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was performed on patients with extensive-disease small cell lung cancer (ED- SCLC). As a result, PCI was reported to reduce the incidence of symptomatic brain metastasis and to prolong patient survival. However, their treatments were completely different from our routine medical care. For example, they did not perform tests to examine whether there was a metastatic brain tumor before assignment to the PCI group or observation group and, after assignment, symptoms alone were observed and no imaging test was performed. For this reason, in Japan, we corrected this inconsistency of protocol and repeated the trial to determine whether PCI contributes to prolonged survival. Participants and Method: Included in the current trial were patients who underwent two or more cycles of platinum-based combination chemotherapy, had achieved at least stable disease (SD), and had no metastatic brain tumor on their MRI. They were randomly assigned to either the PCI group or observation group. Follow-up with brain, chest and abdominal diagnostic imaging tests was performed every three months in both groups. Result(s): In the first pre-specified interim analysis, it was found that there was no possibility of improving patient prognosis using PCI even if the trial were continued. An independent data monitoring committee therefore terminated the trial. At that time, 224 cases had already been enrolled, with 113 cases assigned to the PCI group and 111 cases to the observation group. Median survival period in the final analysis was 11.6 months for the PCI group and 13.7 months for the observation group (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.68). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups, but PCI actually tended to make the prognosis somewhat worse or, at least, did not improve prognosis in patients with ED-SCLC. Discussion(s): The biggest difference between the two trials was whether follow-up assessments were conducted using symptoms or brain MRI. In the current trial, it is impossible to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic brain metastasis cases; however, in the European trial, asymptomatic brain metastasis cases were also included, which means that there were in fact two different subgroups in the PCI group: a subgroup of patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis undergoing therapeutic cranial irradiation and a subgroup of patients without brain metastasis undergoing true PCI. It seems that the survival difference between patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis in the PCI group and in the observation group caused the apparent improvement of survival period. On the other hand, it is conjectured that PCI generated a lot of toxic effects in the patients without brain metastasis and that their survival curve tended to be inferior. PCI is a treatment to prevent new brain metastasis. One year of PCI reduces the incidence of new brain metastasis in no more than 30% of cases. For patients with MRI showing no metastatic brain tumor, needless PCI can be avoided by performing regular brain imaging tests, without impairing survival.",Excluded,0.972605
3877,"Feasibility and utility of re-treatment with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE in GEP-NENs relapsed after treatment with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC Purpose: Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a valid therapy for grade 1/2 gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). Although a median progression-free survival (PFS) of more than 20 months is frequently observed, the majority of patients relapse after 2 - 3 years. In the present study, we investigated the use of low dosage re-treatment with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE (Lu-PRRT) in patients with GEP-NENs who relapsed after treatment with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC (Y-PRRT). Method(s): Upon tumour progression, 26 patients with a PFS of at least 12 months after Y-PRRT were consecutively enrolled in a phase II study of re-treatment with Lu-PRRT. All patients had preserved kidney and haematological parameters and received 14.8 - 18.5 GBq of Lu-PRRT in four or five cycles. The disease control rate (DCR), toxicity, PFS and prognostic factors were evaluated. Result(s): Median total activity of Lu-PRRT was 16.5 GBq in five cycles. The DCR was 84.6 %, median PFS was 22 months (95 % CI 16 months - not reached) compared to 28 months (95 % CI 20 - 36 months) after Y-PRRT. Tumour burden and number of liver metastases were important prognostic factors. Toxicity was mild after Lu-PRRT re-treatment in the majority of patients, with only two patients with grade 2 and one with grade 3 bone marrow toxicity; one patient had grade 2 and one grade 3 renal toxicity. Conclusion(s): Patients with GEP-NEN who have previously responded to Y-PRRT are suitable candidates for Lu-PRRT re-treatment on progression. Although our sample size was limited, low-dosage Lu-PRRT was safe, and led to DCR and PFS rates comparable with those observed when Y-PRRT was used as primary treatment.

3878,"Nongynecologic Findings Seen at Pelvic US Ultrasonography (US) is frequently the first imaging modality used to examine women with symptoms involving the pelvis. It is widely available and involves no exposure to ionizing radiation. Images can be acquired with a transabdominal, endovaginal, or translabial approach, and the use of video clips and three-dimensional reconstructions can be helpful. US is excellent for assessment of the uterus, ovaries, and adnexa. Occasionally, nongynecologic pelvic diseases arising from the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal systems and the pelvic peritoneal and extraperitoneal spaces may be detected and can be a source of diagnostic dilemma. US can be helpful not only in the detection but also occasionally in the characterization of such entities. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are useful in complicated cases. In this article, the normal US appearance of the bowel and US signs of bowel disease and specific entities, including appendicitis, diverticular disease, bowel obstruction, appendiceal mucocele, and intestinal tumors, are reviewed. The lower urinary tract is included in the field of view in every pelvic US examination; commonly encountered entities related to the urinary bladder, distal ureter, and urethra are illustrated. In addition to arising in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, pathologic conditions in the pelvis can arise in the peritoneal or extraperitoneal space. Although conditions of the pelvic peritoneal and extraperitoneal spaces are rare, it is important to recognize these entities and distinguish them from the more common gynecologic diseases.

3880,"Radiation dose during coronary angiography: Correlation to body mass index Introduction: Coronary angiography (CAG) is a commonly performed procedure in cardiology, resulting in patients being exposed to radiation. Patients with high body mass index (BMI) are at increased risk of coronary artery disease. Catheter laboratory intensifiers use automatic exposure control (AEC) which adjusts radiation dose aiming to provide optimal quality images. Factors shown to be responsible for dose variability are complexity of the procedure, operator experience, their level of training in radiation protection, type and performance of x-ray equipment. The objective of present study was to evaluate if radiation dose received by patients correlated with BMI. Method(s): Retrospective data for 3678 CAG performed from Sep-07 to Mar-10 from a single centre, were analysed. Radiation dose was calculated as Dose Area Product (DAP) in mGym . Result(s): Mean radiation dose during the procedure was 4339 +/- 286 mGym . Mean BMI, contrast volume used and screening time were 29.22 +/- 0.08 kg/m2, 125 +/- 10.0 ml and 5.2 +/- 0.1 minutes respectively. BMI was positively correlated with increasing radiation dose during CAG (graph-1 &2). Patients with increased BMI did not require prolonged procedure or increased contrast volume. There was no significant inter-operator variability. Even Ten degree increase in angulation (oblique, cranial or caudal) increased radiation dose significantly. Conclusion(s): Patients with increased BMI receive a significantly higher radiation dose during CAG, affecting not only the patient, but every one present in the catheter laboratory. This has to be recognized by the operator when undertaking procedures in patients with a high BMI.",Excluded,0.086107224
3881,"Plaque Neovascularization Is Increased in Human Carotid Atherosclerosis Related to Prior Neck Radiotherapy: A Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Study OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of radiotherapy (RT) on intraplaque neovascularization (IPN) in human carotid arteries.BACKGROUND: Exposure of the carotid arteries to RT during treatment for head and neck cancer is associated with increased risk for stroke. However, the effect of RT on IPN, a precursor to intraplaque hemorrhage and thus associated with plaque vulnerability, is unknown.METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patients who had undergone unilateral RT for head and neck cancer >=2 years previously underwent B-mode and contrast-enhanced ultrasound of both RT-side and non-RT-side carotid arteries. Presence of IPN during contrast-enhanced ultrasound was judged semiquantitatively as grade 0 (absent), grade 1 (present but limited to plaque base), or grade 2 (extensive and noted within plaque body).RESULTS: Of 49 patients studied, 38 (78%) had plaques. The number of plaques was significantly greater in the RT than the non-RT arteries. Overall, 48 of 64 RT-side plaques (75%) had IPN compared with 9 of 23 non-RT-side (39%) plaques (p = 0.002). Among patients with plaques, IPN was present in 81% of patients with RT-side plaques and 41% of patients with non-RT-side plaques (p = 0.004). Grade 0 IPN was significantly more common in patients with non-RT-side plaques (25% vs. 61%; p = 0.002), whereas grade 2 plaques were more common on the RT side (31% vs. 9%; p = 0.03). The only clinical variable that predicted the presence or absence of IPN was RT laterality.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in humans to reveal a significant association between RT and the presence and extent of IPN.

3883,"Direct oral anticoagulants in patients with cancer Introduction Cancer patients are at high risk for morbidity and mortality due to thrombosis and bleeding, in addition they may also have pre-existing conditions, such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and prior venous thromboembolism (VTE), for which chronic anticoagulation may be indicated. Historically, warfarin was the most commonly prescribed anticoagulant for stroke prevention in AF patients. Since 2010, the US FDA has approved 4 alternative direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) - dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF. There is limited literature to support the use of DOACs in cancer patients, but they are being prescribed by medical professionals nonetheless. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of the DOACs in cancer patients, to quantify their bleeding risks, and to identify patients that are more likely to benefit from these new medications in comparison to warfarin. Large randomized clinical trials of DOACs compared to warfarin in cancer patients have not been performed. Our aim was to determine the effectiveness and associated risk of DOACs vs. warfarin in a large, real-world population of cancer patients with AF. Methods We identified 532,743 AF patients initiating oral anticoagulant use in 2010-2014 continuously enrolled in MarketScan databases. We selected 41,036 cancer patients with inpatient or outpatient ICD9 code 140.x-172.x and 174.x-209.x (excluded 173.x, non-melanoma skin cancer), and then identified a subset of cancer patients being actively treated at the time of anticoagulant initiation. Active cancer patients were defined by the use of chemotherapy, radiation therapy or cancer surgery within 6 months prior to the start of anticoagulation. Patients were categorized according to the first anticoagulant prescribed after AF diagnosis. DOAC users were matched with warfarin users by age (+/-3 years), sex, enrollment date (90 days), and anticoagulant initiation date (90 days). Study endpoints, including ischemic stroke, severe bleeding (intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding), other bleeding (genitourinary bleeding, hemopericardium, hemarthrosis, epistaxis, hemoptysis and unspecified hemorrhage) and VTE were identified using inpatient diagnostic codes, and VTE was additionally identified from 2 outpatient diagnostic codes within the same year. Cox proportional hazards models were used to access the association between type of anticoagulant and outcomes adjusting for high-dimensional propensity score, age, sex, CHA DS -VASc score, and the prevalent outcome. Results The demographic profile of the patients included in the analysis are depicted in Table 1, and Table 2 summarizes the outcomes data. In this analysis there were 6,075 cancer patients with AF who were on DOACs (rivaroxaban 2808, dabigatran 2189, and apixaban 1078) compared to 10,021 on warfarin, with a mean age of 74 years, and a mean follow-up time of 1 year. Approximately 40% of the patients were woman, and breast cancer was the most common cancer in each cohort. We found that for rivaroxaban and dabigatran users, the adjusted hazard ratios for severe bleeding was non significantly different to warfarin users, however, apixaban users had a lower risk of severe bleeding compared to warfarin users, with a hazard ratio 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.79, p=0.01). The risk of other bleeding was lower in dabigatran users compared to warfarin users with a hazard ratio 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.41-0.84, p=0.003). The risk of ischemic stroke did not differ significantly amongst different anticoagulant users. Each of the DOACs was superior to warfarin in lowering the risk of incident VTE, with p values < 0.0001. Conclusion Based on this analysis the DOACs seem to be well tolerated in cancer patients in regard to the management of atrial fibrillation, with lower or similar rates of bleeding and stroke compared to warfarin users. Importantly, the DOAC users had a significantly lower risk of incident VTE. Given that VTE ev nts contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in cancer patients, prescription of DOACs in place of warfarin can be considered in cancer patients with AF, while we are awaiting prospective data from randomized trials.

This ""benign"" condition can cause significant neurologic morbidity both from the disease and unnecessary surgical treatment of the disease. Although rare, generally intracranial RDD has been treated with chemotherapy or radiation with limited role for surgery to relieve mass effect. Surgical approaches to the skull base are invasive and pose risk, especially for a benign and self-limiting disease like RDD. Presented, is the case of a 63-year-old woman with a presumed spheno-cavernous meningioma that was previously radiated without tissue diagnosis. In the interim, she was diagnosed with RDD by her dermatologist after skin biopsy. Upon presentation, the patient was experiencing retroorbital headaches and blurry vision, and MR imaging demonstrated progression of her lesion. On examination she had mild right proptosis and a partial Cranial Nerve III palsy. For these reasons, surgical biopsy was undertaken with the goal of orbital and optic nerve decompressions.

LITT systems use a laser energy probe that can be inserted into the patient, emitting near infrared laser radiation that induces necrosis in clinical targets while providing thermal damage updates via MR thermometry. The rigid laser probes range two and three mm in diameter, through which the thermal energy efficiently emits along straight-line pathways. The systems allow for varying dwell times and rates of energy deposition to assist in the ability to maximize the thermal damage to the target tissues while minimizing the damage to normal tissues. For targets that cannot be treated along a linear trajectory, multiple trajectories are necessary. However, planning systems, like those available in ionizing radiation delivery, are all but absent from the clinical setting. The goals of this project aim to provide a planning system to allow the optimization of the laser trajectory. Method(s): Twelve patients who underwent LITT therapy using traditional approaches, where the surgeon decided on laser trajectory by inspection of orthogonal radiology images were post procedure planned using a rudimentary system of LITT planning. Starting with a stereotactic planning system, a thermal dose kernel was developed. This effort has provided a rudimentary tool that yields first estimates for optimized LITT. Result(s): A conformal index was developed and evaluated for each planning technique. The average index for the simple inspection of orthogonal images based on thermal dose threshold lines was 88.4% while the conformal index of the planning system were 46.2%. Conclusion(s): As with ionizing radiation, it is anticipated that this increase in thermal optimization will translate into better tumor control and lower complications. A system, with a more precise thermal predictive algorithm and automated trajectory planning is being pursued.",Excluded,0.0857903

3890,"Maturation of firing pattern in chick vestibular nucleus neurons The principal cells of the chick tangential nucleus are vestibular nucleus neurons participating in the vestibuloocular and vestibulocollic reflexes. In birds and mammals, spontaneous and stimulus-evoked firing of action potentials is essential for vestibular nucleus neurons to generate mature vestibular reflex activity. The emergence of spike-firing pattern and the underlying ion channels were studied in morphologically-identified principal cells using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from brain slices of late-term embryos (embryonic day 16) and hatchling chickens (hatching day 1 and hatching day 5). Spontaneous spike activity emerged around the perinatal period, since at embryonic day 16 none of the principal cells generated spontaneous action potentials. However, at hatching day 1, 50% of the cells fired spontaneously (range, 3 to 32 spikes/s), which depended on synaptic transmission in most cells. By hatching day 5, 80% of the principal cells could fire action potentials spontaneously (range, 5 to 80 spikes/s), and this activity was independent of synaptic transmission and showed faster kinetics than at hatching day 1. Repetitive firing in response to depolarizing pulses appeared in the principal cells starting around embryonic day 16, when <20% of the neurons fired repetitively. However, almost 90% of the principal cells exhibited repetitive firing on depolarization at hatching day 1, and 100% by hatching day 5. From embryonic day 16 to hatching day 5, the gain for evoked spike firing increased almost 10-fold. At hatching day 5, a persistent sodium channel was essential for the generation of spontaneous spike activity, while a small conductance, calcium-dependent potassium current modulated both the spontaneous and evoked spike firing activity. Altogether, these in vitro studies showed that during the perinatal period, the principal cells switched from displaying no spontaneous spike activity at resting membrane potential and generating one spike on depolarization to the tonic firing of spontaneous and evoked action potentials.",Excluded,0.08928054

This study was performed to find out the effect of mobile phone frequency on male Wistar rats. Animals were divided into two groups (n=6 in each group). Group one was considered as control and group two (experimental group) was exposed to microwave radiation (2100MHz) for 4 hours/day (5 days/week) for 3 months. Exposure of microwave radiation frequency showed significant alterations in cholinesterase activity, muscular strength, learning ability and anxiety. MWR exposure was also associated with significant alteration in the oxidative defense system and hippocampus degeneration. Histopathological observations clearly depicted the neural degeneration. Thus, it can be concluded that MWR significantly affects the central nervous system and may lead to many severe illnesses.

3893,"Ambient neutron and photon dose equivalent H (10) around a pencil beam scanning proton therapy facility OBJECTIVES: To measure leakage ambient dose equivalent H*(10) from stray secondary neutron and photon radiation around proton therapy (PT) facility and evaluate adequacy of shielding design.METHODS AND MATERIALS: H*(10) measurement were carried out at 149 locations around cyclotron vault (CV), beam transport system (BTS) and first treatment room (GTR3) of a multiroom PT facility using WENDI-II and SmartIon survey meter. Measurement were performed under extreme case scenarios wherein maximum secondary neutrons and photons were produced around CV, BTS and GTR3 by stopping 230MeV proton of 300nA on beam degrader, end of BTS and isocenter of GTR3. Weekly time average dose rate (TADR) were calculated from H*(10) value measured at selective hot spots by irradiating actual treatment plans of mix clinical sites.RESULTS: The maximum total H*(10) were within 2 microSv/hr around CV, 5 microSv/hr around outer wall of BTS which increases up to 62 microSv/hr at the end of inside BTS corridor. Maximum H*(10) of 20.8 microSv/hr in treatment control console (P125), 23.4 microSv/hr behind the common wall between GTR3 and GTR2 (P132) and 25.7 microSv/hr above isocenter (P99) were observed around GTR3. Reduction of beam current from 6 to 3 nA and 1 nA at nozzle exit lead to decrease in total H*(10) at P125 from 20.8 to 11.35 and 4.62 microSv/hr. In comparison to extreme case scenario, H*(10) value at P125, P132 and P99 from clinically relevant irradiation parameters were reduce by a factor ranging from 8.6 for high range cube to 46.4 for brain clinical plan. The maximum weekly TADR per fraction was highest for large volume, sacral chordoma patient at 8.5 microSv/hr compare to 0.3 microSv/hr for brain patient. The calculated weekly TADR for 30 mix clinical cases and 15 fractions of 1 L cube resulted total weekly TADR of 83-84 microSv/hr at P125, P132 and P99. The maximum annual dose level at these hot spots were estimated at 4.37 mSv/Yr.CONCLUSION: We have carried out an extensive measurement of H*(10) under different conditions. The shielding thickness of our PT facility is adequate to limit the dose to occupational worker and general public within the permissible stipulated limit. The data reported here can bridge the knowledge gap in ambient dose around PT facility and can also be used as a reference for any new and existing proton facility for intercomparison and validation.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: First extensive investigation of neutron and photon H*(10) around PT facility and can bridge the knowledge gap on ambient dose.",Excluded,0.086981766
3894,"Discrimination and quantification of live/dead rat brain cells using a non-linear segmentation model The automatic cell analysis method is capable of segmenting the cells and can detect the number of live/dead cells present in the body. This study proposed a novel non-linear segmentation model (NSM) for the segmentation and quantification of live/dead cells present in the body. This work also reveals the aspects of electromagnetic radiation on the cell body. The bright images of the hippocampal CA3 region of the rat brain under the resolution of 60 x objective are used to analyze the effects called NISSL-stained dataset. The proposed non-linear segmentation model segments the foreground cells from the cell images based on the linear regression analysis. These foreground cells further get discriminated as live/dead cells and quantified using shape descriptors and geometric method, respectively. The proposed segmentation model is showing promising results (accuracy, 82.82%) in comparison with the existing renowned approaches. The counting analysis of live and dead cells using the proposed method is far better than the manual counts. Therefore, the proposed segmentation model and quantifying procedure is an amalgamated method for cell quantification that yields better segmentation results and provides pithy insights into the analysis of neuronal anomalies at a microscopic level.

3895,"Mitochondrial Degeneration and Autophagy Associated With Delayed Effects of Radiation in the Mouse Brain Mitochondria are linked with various radiation responses, including mitophagy, genomic instability, apoptosis, and the bystander effect. Mitochondria play an important role in preserving cellular homeostasis during stress responses, and dysfunction in mitochondrial contributes to aging, carcinogenesis and neurologic diseases. In this study, we have investigated the mitochondrial degeneration and autophagy in the hippocampal region of brains from mice administered with BBT-059, a long-acting interleukin-11 analog, or its formulation buffer 24 h prior to irradiation at different radiation doses collected at 6 and 12 months post-irradiation. The results demonstrated a higher number of degenerating mitochondria in 12 Gy BBT-059 treated mice after 6 months and 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice after 12 months as compared to the age-matched naive (non-irradiated control animals). Apg5l, Lc3b and Sqstm1 markers were used to analyze the autophagy in the brain, however only the Sqstm1 marker exhibited significantly reduced expression after 12 months in 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice as compared to naive. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results of Bcl2 also demonstrated a decrease in expression after 12 months in 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice as compared to other groups. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that higher doses of ionizing radiation (IR) can cause persistent upregulation of mitochondrial degeneration. Reduced levels of Sqstm1 and Bcl2 can lead to intensive autophagy which can lead to degradation of cellular structure.",Included,0.9843642

The patients were randomized to receive two different postoperative external radiation protocols, Study Group A: Localized field external radiotherapy 50 Gy/25#/5 wks followed by Boost 10 Gy/5#/1 wk, Control Group B: Whole brain external radiotherapy 40 Gy/20#/4 wks followed by Boost 20 Gy/10#/2 wks by localized field.RESULTS: 20/25 (80%) patients in the study group and 14/25 (56%) patients in the control group showed improvement in their Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Thus a significant difference in the performance status was noted in favor of limited field irradiation. No significant difference in the local response was seen between the two groups after radiotherapy. Six months progression-free survival of the study group was 44% as compared to 26% in the control group. Six months overall survival was 66.67% in the study group and 50.72% in the control group (P<0.01).

3897,"Concurrent temozolomide and radiation in elderly patients with glioblastoma: A retrospective analysis Purpose/Objective(s): Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Radiation with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide is well tolerated and significantly improves survival. In studying this treatment approach, patients >=70 years of age have rarely been included. Here we examine the potential benefit of concurrent temozolomide in patients >=70. Materials/Methods: Retrospective chart review of patient records treated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) between January 1, 2004 and January 1, 2010, with radiation (XRT) for GBM with or without temozolomide. Analysis was limited to patients >= 70 years of age with GBM, who received XRT at MDACC, had no previous chemotherapy or XRT for their diagnosis, and had no prior grade 1-3 glioma diagnosis. Of 170 patients >=70 years old at the time of histopathologic diagnosis of GBM by either biopsy or resection, 51 met these criteria, (median age 75, range 70- 87). Extent of tumor resection was evaluated by surgical reports and immediate postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval between initial GBM diagnosis to death or last follow-up. Progression free survival (PFS) was calculated as interval between diagnosis and documented progression or death. Overall median follow up was 7 months (0-43), with median of 4 months (0-31) in the XRT only group, and 10 months (1-43) in the XRT + temozolomide group. Survival differences were calculated via the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log rank statistics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using Cox-regression analysis. This study was reviewed and approved by the MDACC Internal Review Board. Result(s): On univariate analysis, the following variables were significantly associated with overall survival: Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) (<80 vs >= 80 p = 0.039), radiation dose (<= 50 Gy vs > 50 Gy, p = 0.013), concurrent temozolomide (p = 0.006) and extent of surgery (biopsy vs subtotal resection vs gross total resection, p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis, extent of surgery, concurrent temozolamide and XRT dose were associated with improved OS (p=0.003). Median OS for the population was 8 months (<1-43). OS in those patients treated with XRT alone was 5 months vs 11 months in those patients receiving XRT and temozolomide (p =0.004). Median progression free survival was 5 months (<1-28) with no significant difference (p =0.164) between treatment groups. Conclusion(s):With short follow up, temozolomide in addition to radiation therapy is associated with improved overall survival in patients withGBM>=70 years.

The objective of this work was the development of recommendations for combined treatment of AVMs based on analysis of the available material and published data.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 93 patients hospitalized at the Neurosurgical Institute for combined treatment of cerebral AVMs in 2010-2014. A group of combined surgery (removal of an AVM with preoperative embolization) consisted of 40 patients, and a group of combined radiotherapy (radiation after partial embolization or partial removal of an AVM) included 53 patients. 36 patients underwent radiosurgery, and 17 patients received stereotactic radiation therapy. Both groups were analyzed in terms of outcomes, complications, and follow-up results.RESULTS: In the group of combined surgery, according to the Glasgow outcome scale, good results (grade 4-5) were achieved in 35 (87.5%) patients at discharge and in 27 (90%) patients during follow-up. Treatment outcomes, surgery duration, and the amount of blood loss were not significantly different from those in the control group. Complete AVM obliteration was achieved in 29 (80.6%) patients 3 years after radiosurgery and in 8 (47%) patients after stereotactic radiotherapy. In discussion, these findings are compared to the published data, and recommendations for AVM treatment are suggested.CONCLUSION: The combined treatment of AVMs is effective management for patients with complex AVMs (Spetzler-Martin grade III-IV AVMs).

Several researchers have demonstrated that A beta is neurotoxic in in vitro and in vivo systems. Peptide aggregation state and/or conformation might play a significant role in determining the toxicity of the peptide. The size and flexibility of fibrils formed from the synthetic peptide beta (1-39), corresponding to the first 39 residues of A beta, were determined. Samples were prepared either directly from lyophilized peptide or diluted from a 10 mg/ml stock solution in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). All samples had a final peptide concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, a final pH of 7.4, and a final NaCl concentration of 0.14 M. The molecular weight and linear density of the fibrils increased with increasing pre-incubation time in TFA, based on static light scattering measurements.

A sensitivity analysis is presented for a self-consistent set of parameters involved in mouse phototransduction. The organising framework is a spatio-temporal mathematical model, which includes the geometry of the rod outer segment (ROS), the layered array of the discs, the incisures, the biochemistry of the activation/deactivation cascade and the biophysics of the diffusion of the second messengers in the cytoplasm and the closing of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) gated cationic channels. These modules include essentially all the relevant geometrical, biochemical and biophysical parameters. The parameters are selected from within experimental ranges, to obey basic first principles such as conservation of mass and energy fluxes. By means of the model they are compared to a large set of experimental data, providing a strikingly close match. Following isomerisation of a single rhodopsin R * (single photon response), the sensitivity analysis was carried out on the photo-response, measured both in terms of number of effector molecules produced, and photocurrent suppression, at peak time and the activation and recovery phases of the cascade. The current suppression is found to be very sensitive to variations of the catalytic activities, Hill's coefficients and hydrolysis rates and the geometry of the ROS, including size and shape of the incisures. The activated effector phosphodiesterase (PDE *) is very sensitive to variations of catalytic activity of G-protein activation and the average lifetimes of activated rhodopsin R * and PDE *; however, they are insensitive to geometry and variations of the transduction parameters. Thus the system is separated into two functional modules, activation/deactivation and transduction, each confined in different geometrical domains, communicating through the hydrolysis of cGMP by PDE *, and each sensitive to variations of parameters only in its own module.",Excluded,0.085886545

Materials/Methods:We identified 219 patients who were treated with FSRT for base of skull meningioma from 1/1/1994 through 3/1/2009. Seven patients received a second course of radiation therapy. We analyzed each treatment course separately, and classified treatments into four groups: RT only, adjuvant RT, RT for progression after surgery, and Re-irradiation after progression (with or without prior surgery). Symptoms were classified based on the cranial nerve affected. The gross target volume (GTV) was defined by T1-weighted MRI with contrast without inclusion of dural tails. The median prescription dose was 52.2 Gy (range 10 - 60 Gy). Patients were treated using multi-isocenter plans (median 79% isodose line) until 2004, and subsequently with single isocenter plans (median 90% isodose line). Cox proportional hazards models were used to indentify factors associated with progression, and multiple logistic regression was used to identify predictors of symptom improvement. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 3.1 years. Of 226 FSRT treatment courses, 116 were in the (51%) RT only group, 40 (18%) in the adjuvant RT group, 59 (26%) in the RT for progression after surgery group, and 11 (5%) in the re-irradiation after progression group. Patients were symptomatic at the time of radiation in 92% of cases. The most common symptoms were visual field and/or acuity deficits (55%), impaired extra-ocular movements (32%), and facial numbness (20%). Twenty-one patients progressed after FSRT. Local control rate at 5 years was 95.4% in the RTonly group, 89.8% in the adjuvant group (p=0.98), 74.3% in the progression after surgery group (p = 0.02), and 50% in the re-irradiation group (p<0.01).

Of all patients symptomatic at presentation, 50.7% had subjective improvement in at least one symptom, and occurred at a median of 4.0 months. These improvements were durable in 82%-100% of cases, depending on cranial nerve involved. Only prior surgery (OR 0.48 95% CI 0.28 - 0.81) was associated with symptom improvement.

3912,"F43polygenic Risk of Major Depressive Disorder Is Associated with White Matter Microstructure: Evidence from Uk Biobank Imaging Study of 9,748 Participants Background: Previous cohort studies have shown that the onset of Major depressive disorder (MDD) is related to alterations in white matter microstructure in the brain, especially in the tracts that involve in emotional processes such as the thalamic radiations. Earlier attempts to identify any associations between MDD polygenic risk (MDD-pgrs) and white matter microstructure have so far been heterogeneous. In the present study, we used the polygenic risk scores created based on the summary statistics from PGC and the imaging data from UK Biobank (N= 9,748) to test for an association between brain structural connectivity and MDD genetic risk. Method(s): We used IDPs (imaging-derived phenotypes) from UK Biobank imaging project. The imaging data was collected on a single scanner and preprocessed in FSL by UK Biobank. 15 major white matter tracts were extracted. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were used as measures for white matter microstructure (higher integrity is associated with higher FA or lower MD). Regression models were applied to test the associations of MDD or MDD-pgrs with white matter microstructure. All effect sizes reported were significant after false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple testing. Result(s): At MDD-pgrs threshold of pT<0.01, MDD-pgrs was associated with a general factor of global white matter microstructure for both FA and MD (FA: beta=-0.027, p=4.51e-3; MD: beta=0.034, p=2.53e-4). At this same threshold, we found a significant association between MDD-pgrs and lower FA in the medial lemniscus (beta=-0.034, pcorrected=7.12e-4), superior thalamic radiation (beta=-0.031, pcorrected=8.79e-3), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (beta=-0.034, pcorrected=7.12e-4), forceps major (beta=-0.026, pcorrected=0.027), and forceps minor (beta=-0.025, pcorrected=0.027). For MD, all the above tracts were significant (beta ranged from 0.018 to 0.034, pcorrected ranged from 4.28e-4 to 0.013), apart from the medial lemniscus. In addition, several additional tracts also showed significant associations with MD, including the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, posterior thalamic radiation, anterior thalamic radiation, uncinate fasciculus, and acoustic radiation (beta ranged from 0.025 to 0.039, pcorrected ranged from 4.28e-3 to 0.047). Discussion(s): MDD-pgrs at the pT<0.01 was associated with reduced white matter microstructure in UKB participants. Significant results were found at other thresholds, but the pT<0.01 showed the most significant and anatomically widespread associations. Results from the latest MDD GWAS that showed the top hits and pathways are mostly associated with neuronal processes. Our findings indicate that the neuronal pathways impacted in MDD may have downstream effects on white matter microstructure. Disclosure: Nothing to disclose. Copyright Â© 2018",Excluded,0.1358279

3916,"High dose radiation induced meningioma Radiation therapy has played an important integral part in the management of various intracranial tumours. However, radiation has been implicated in the development of intracranial tumours. We describe three cases of radiation-induced meningiomas following high dose cranial irradiation. All these patients developed tumours within the previous radiation field and satisfied the criteria used for the definition of radiation-induced neoplasm. The interval between the irradiation and the onset of meningioma was significantly less in the younger patient. All the cases had several unique features of radiation-induced meningioma including features of atypical meningioma. Two patients developed multiple site meningiomas and one patient developed early recurrence of the tumour. This report confirms that patients exposed to cranial irradiation are at lifelong risk of developing radiation-induced tumours such as meningiomas. Hence these patients require long-term clinical and radiological surveillance to detect occurrence as early as possible.",Excluded,0.092660554

The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of F-FDG PET/CT vs. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/MR in differentiating PD from RC in a subpopulation of malignant gliomas. METHOD(S): We evaluated 10 patients with high-grade gliomas whom had previously undergone chemoradiation therapy and developed MR evidence of PD per RANO criteria. All patients underwent <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/MR (MR attenuation correction, PET/MR<sup>AC</sup>), and conventional diagnostic MR (PET/MR<sup>D</sup>). pMR was also performed. Separate consensus blinded readings by two fellowship-trained radiologists (1 neuroradiology; 1 nuclear) were performed to assess the diagnostic efficacy of PET/CT, PET/MR<sup>AC</sup>PET/MR<sup>D</sup>. A qualitative subjective rating was given to each lesion (1 = definite RC; 2 = probable RC; 3 = equivocal; 4 = probable PD; 5 = definite PD). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were determined for the three interpretation sessions after binary reclassification, with a rating of 1-3 defined as RC and 4-5 defined as PD.

3918,"Challenges Conveying Clinical Equipoise and Exploring Patient Treatment Preferences in an Oncology Trial Comparing Active Monitoring with Radiotherapy (ROAM/EORTC 1308) Introduction: Providing balanced information that emphasizes clinical equipoise (i.e., uncertainty regarding the relative merits of trial interventions) and exploring patient treatment preferences can improve informed consent and trial recruitment. Within a trial comparing adjuvant radiotherapy versus active monitoring following surgical resection for an atypical meningioma (ROAM/EORTC-1308), we explored patterns in communication and reasons why health practitioners may find it challenging to convey equipoise and explore treatment preferences. Material(s) and Method(s): Qualitative study embedded within ROAM/EORTC-1308. Data were collected on 40 patients and 18 practitioners from 13 U.K. sites, including audio recordings of 39 patients' trial consultations, 23 patient interviews, and 18 practitioner interviews. Qualitative analysis drew on argumentation theory. Result(s): Practitioners acknowledged the importance of the research question that the trial aimed to answer. However, they often demonstrated a lack of equipoise in consultations, particularly with eligible patients who practitioners believed to be susceptible to side effects (e.g., cognitive impairment) or inconvenienced by radiotherapy. Practitioners elicited but rarely explored patient treatment preferences, especially if a patient expressed an initial preference for active monitoring. Concerns about coercing patients, loss of practitioner agency, and time constraints influenced communication in ways that were loaded against trial participation. Conclusion(s): We identified several challenges that practitioners face in conveying equipoise and exploring patient treatment preferences in oncology, and particularly neuro-oncology, trials with distinct management pathways. The findings informed communication about ROAM/EORTC-1308 and will be relevant to enhancing trial communication in future oncology trials. Qualitative studies embedded within trials can address difficulties with communication, thus improving informed consent and recruitment. ROAM/EORTC-1308 RCT: ISRCTN71502099. Implications for Practice: Oncology trials can be challenging to recruit to, especially those that compare treatment versus monitoring. Conveying clinical equipoise and exploring patient treatment preferences can enhance recruitment and patient understanding. This study focused on the challenges that practitioners encounter in trying to use such communication strategies and how practitioners may inadvertently impede patient recruitment and informed decision making. This article provides recommendations to support practitioners in balancing the content and presentation of trial management pathways. The results can inform training to optimize communication, especially for neuro-oncology trials and trials comparing markedly different management pathways. Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors.

3919,"Connecting radiotherapy with targeted anti-glioma therapy using superparamagnetic nanoparticles conjugated with granzyme B INTRODUCTION: 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) is overexpressed on the membrane of the glioblastoma cells, but not on corresponding normal cells. Membrane-bound Hsp70 (i.e., mHsp70) is rapidly internalized into tumor cells and thus targeting the protein might provide a promising strategy for theranostics. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are contrast negative agents that are used for the detection of tumors with MRI. In the presented study we conjugated the protease Granzyme B which is known to recognize mHsp70 to superparamagnetic iron nanoparticles to assess tumor-specific theranostic targeting before and after radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Synthesized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles covered with Granzyme B protease (GrB-SPIONs) were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering, NMR relaxometry. Cellular interactions of the GrB-SPIONs conjugates with tumor cell lines (i.e., U87, LN229, C6, K562, HeLa) were assessed using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and TEM. Brain tumor targeting was analyzed in the orthotopic C6 glioma model in rats, human U87 and LN229 gliomas in nu/nu mice. Following intravenous administration retention of the nanoparticles in the tumor site was assessed using high-field 11.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with subsequent histological assay. Biodistribution studies of the SPIONs were performed by NLR-M2 measurements. Combination of the nanoparticle targeting with radiotherapy of the brain tumors was performed at small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) (Xstrahl Inc., UK) using single of fractionated irradiation. RESULT(S): In vitro experiments demonstrated the selectivity of GrB-SPIONs conjugates to free and mHsp70 in different tumor cell types in a dose-dependent manner. High-resolution MRI on T2-weighted images showed the retention of the conjugates in C6 glioma model in rats, and U87 and LN229 human orthotopic glioma models in nu/nu mice. Accumulation of GrB-SPION nanoparticles in the glioma resulted in many-fold drop of T2-values in comparison to non-conjugated SPIONs. Biodistribution analysis using NLR-M2 measurements showed an increase in the tumor-to-background (normal brain) uptake ratio of GrB-SPIONs conjugates in glioma-bearing animals in comparison to SPIONs. Accumulation within Hsp70-positive glioma was enhanced after a single dose (10 Gy) of ionizing radiation. Combination of the radiotherapy and application of the GrB-SPIONs significantly increased the survival of the glioma-bearing animals. CONCLUSION(S): Elevated accumulation of the functionalized magnetic nanoparticles in the tumor due to radiosensitization proves the combination of radiotherapy and application of Hsp70-targeted agents such as Granzyme B in the theranostics of brain tumors.",Excluded,0.09143147
3920,"Effect of He-Ne laser radiation on the monoamine in mouse brain Background: It is known that monoamine may take part in the regulation of various functional activities of the body and also in the pathophysiological processes, but the reports about the influnences of low-power laser radiation over monoamine are still rare. Moreover, the results gained are very inconsistent, and some are even contradictory to each other. Objective(s): To elucidate whether low power He-Ne laser radiation can affects serotonin(5-HT) and dopamine(DA) in brain. Design(s): A completely randomlized study based on the experimental. Setting and Materials: The experiment was done in the Central Laboratory of the First Hospital of Beijing University. Materials used were 90 Kunming male mice with body-weight 20-27 g, supplied by Beijing University Animal Centre. Intervention(s): The mice were randomly assigned to 5 groups with randomized arithmetic form. They are normal control group, sham radiation group, aser irradiation group A(13.8 J/cm<sup>2</sup>), aser irradiation group B (27.6 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) and laser irradiation group C(55.1 J/cm<sup>2</sup>). The cranial bone and brain of the mouse was exposed under mild anesthesia and irradiated on the sinciput with different doses of He-Ne laser. Then the mice were killed by decapitation. Living creature samples were made. Main Outcome Measure(s): The cerebral serotonin and dopamine were observed and measured by means of high performance liguid chromatography-electrochemistry (HPLC-EC). Result(s): Dopamine contents (ng/g) were 485.4 +/- 10.1 in laser group A, 505.8 +/- 10.3 in laser group B and 524.1 +/- 10.5 in laser group C, with significant difference as compared with that of the sham laser group( 446.5 +/- 7.1) (P < 0.05, F = 4.64; P < 0.01, F = 8.63; P < 0.01, F = 14.52, respectively). Serotonin contents (ng/g) were 1 283.8 +/- 25.1 in laser group A, 1 337.0 +/- 26.8 in laser group B and 1429.9 +/- 30.1 in laser group C, significantly higher than that of the sham laser group(1 198.0 +/- 28.5) (P < 0.05, F = 4.92; P < 0.01, F = 9.75; P < 0.01, F = 16.83, respectively). It was found that there was a significant increase in the cerebral serotonin and dopamine in the irradiated mice, and within the laser dose range used, the larger is the laser dose was, the more DA and 5-HT are. Conclusion(s): He-Ne laser radiation may cause a significant increase in 5-HT and DA in the brain of the mice, and the increase is related to the dose of laser radiation.",Excluded,0.09477795
3921,"Direct regulation of CREB transcriptional activity by ATM in response to genotoxic stress Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a syndrome of cancer susceptibility, immune dysfunction, and neurodegeneration that is caused by mutations in the A-T-mutated (ATM) gene. ATM has been implicated as a critical regulator of cellular responses to DNA damage, including the activation of cell cycle checkpoints and induction of apoptosis. Although defective cell cycle-checkpoint regulation and associated genomic instability presumably contribute to cancer susceptibility in A-T, the mechanism of neurodegeneration in A-T is not well understood. In addition, although ATM is required for the induction of the p53 transcriptional program in response to DNA damage, the identities of the relevant transcription factors that mediate ATM-dependent changes in gene expression remain largely undetermined. In this article, we describe a signal transduction pathway linking ATM directly to the Ca(2+)/cAMP response element-binding protein, CREB, a transcription factor that regulates cell growth, homeostasis, and survival. ATM phosphorylated CREB in vitro and in vivo in response to ionizing radiation (IR) and H(2)O(2) on a stress-inducible domain. IR-induced phosphorylation of CREB correlated with a decrease in CREB transactivation potential and reduced interaction between CREB and its transcriptional coactivator, CREB-binding protein (CBP). A CREB mutant containing Ala substitutions at ATM phosphorylation sites displayed enhanced transactivation potential, resistance to inhibition by IR, and increased binding to CBP. We propose that ATM-mediated phosphorylation of CREB in response to DNA damage modulates CREB-dependent gene expression and that dysregulation of the ATM-CREB pathway may contribute to neurodegeneration in A-T.",Excluded,0.087455794
3922,"Boron neutron capture therapy combined with early successive bevacizumab treatments for recurrent malignant gliomas - A pilot study Recurrent malignant gliomas (RMGs) are difficult to control, and no standard protocol has been established for their treatment. At our institute, we have often treated RMGs by tumor-selective particle radiation called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). However, despite the cell-selectivity of BNCT, brain radiation necrosis (BRN) may develop and cause severe neurological complications and sometimes death. This is partly due to the full-dose X-ray treatments usually given earlier in the treatment course. To overcome BRN following BNCT, recent studies have used bevacizumab (BV). We herein used extended BV treatment beginning just after BNCT to confer protection against or ameliorate BRN, and evaluated; the feasibility, efficacy, and BRN control of this combination treatment. Seven patients with RMGs (grade 3 and 4 cases) were treated with BNCT between June 2013 and May 2014, followed by successive BV treatments. They were followed-up to December 2017. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after combination treatment were 15.1 and 5.4 months, respectively. In one case, uncontrollable brain edema occurred and ultimately led to death after BV was interrupted due to meningitis. In two other cases, symptomatic aggravation of BRN occurred after interruption of BV treatment. No BRN was observed during the observation period in the other cases. Common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 2 and 3 proteinuria occurred in two cases and necessitated the interruption of BV treatments. Boron neutron capture therapy followed by BV treatments well-prevented or well-controlled BRN with prolonged OS and acceptable incidence of adverse events in our patients with RMG.

3923,"Assessment of the proliferative activity and radiosensitivity of human tumours using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay We established an in vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay of human tumours for estimation of the proportion of cells undergoing mitosis (the dividing fraction, DF), the time for the number of nuclei to double and the radiosensitivity in terms of the micronucleus frequency, based on a concept described previously. Under certain conditions, the nuclear number doubling time (NNDT) was considered to represent the potential doubling time. Tumour specimens obtained at surgery were disaggregated into single-cell suspensions and were directly cultured in the presence of cytochalasin B with or without irradiation. At various intervals, the percentage of multinucleate cells (the plateau value represented the DF), the average number of nuclei per cell and the number of micronuclei in binucleate cells were determined. DF and NNDT values were obtained in 58 of the 73 tumours investigated, and the micronucleus frequency was obtained in 54 of these 58 tumours. The DF ranged from 4.1% to 71% and the NNDT ranged from 3.1 to 83 days. A DF > or = 20% was associated with a higher recurrence rate in patients undergoing curative operation. A correlation was found between the NNDT and the time to relapse in patients with recurrent disease. The average number of micronuclei per binucleate cell at 2 Gy of irradiation (after subtraction of the value at 0 Gy) ranged from 0.052 to 0.35. Tumours which produced more micronuclei after irradiation showed a better response to radiotherapy. This assay can be readily performed on human tumours and appears to have promise as a predictive assay for radiation therapy.",Excluded,0.08663303
3924,"Improved survival rate in primary intracranial lymphoma treated by high-dose radiation and systemic vincristine-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide-prednisolone chemotherapy Thirty patients with histologically proven primary intracranial non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were treated at Kyoto University. Ten of them were treated prospectively with a radiation-chemotherapy protocol. All but four specimens were recently reexamined and classified according to the Working Formulation system. The predominant histologic types were diffuse large cell type, large cell immunoblastic type, and diffuse mixed small and large cell type, seen in 38%, 21% and 21% of cases, respectively. Before 1980, 16 patients were treated with postoperative radiation without definite chemotherapy, and only one has survived more than 5 years. Local recurrence was the most common cause of failure. In 1981, the authors started a protocol in which four to six courses of systemic chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (VEPA) was given after whole brain radiation (30-40 Gy) with a local boost up to 50 to 60 Gy. Eight patients completed this protocol, and all of them are alive at 16 to 100 months after diagnosis, with three patients surviving more than 5 years. Only one patient developed recurrence. On the other hand, six patients who did not complete or receive chemotherapy after 1981 are dead or alive with recurrence. Corelation between the Working Formulation subtype and prognosis was not clear because of the variety of treatment. Two patients receiving chemotherapy developed brain necrosis, which was fatal in one case, and the other two patients treated with the protocol are in a poor state without signs of recurrence. Chemotherapy may enhance the radiation effect on normal brain tissue as well as tumor. Combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy can improve the survival rate, but the optimal dosage needs to be investigated further.",Excluded,0.08766298
3925,"Case of a patient with bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis presenting with photosensitive attacks State the Purpose: Photosensitive attacks are not generally known as TIA. We experienced a patient with photosensitive attacks induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Method(s): A 60-year-old man presented to our hospital because he experienced photosensitive attacks, which first occurred 3 months previously. In the case of our patient, sunlight always induced a photosensitive attack, during which he was blinded for approximately 10 minutes. He did not experience convulsions, loss of consciousness, headache, and symptoms of amaurosis. Ophthalmological examination, electroencephalography, and brain computed tomography (CT) did not indicate any abnormal findings. The patient was exposed to cervical radiation for pharyngeal cancer approximately 16 years previously. He did not have migraine, diabetes, and any previous cerebrovascular disease. The patient had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both of which were not treated appropriately. Result(s): One month after visiting our hospital, he experienced transient ischemic attacks (TIA) with right hemiparesis. Thereafter, the patient underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed small cerebral infarctions. Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed no abnormalities; however, ultrasound of the carotid artery showed stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA). Cerebral angiography also showed bilateral ICA stenosis (approximately 90%). A 99m-Technetium- ECD single-photon emission CT scan revealed low bilateral occipital perfusion. Because the bilateral ICA stenosis was induced by radiation, we decided to perform carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) instead of carotid endarterectomy. After CAS of the left carotid artery, the patient's photosensitivity completely disappeared. Conclusion(s): Photosensitive attacks are not generally known as TIA. In the present case, photosensitive attacks appear to have been induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.",Excluded,0.08627178

3928,"Gamma irradiation inhibits neointimal hyperplasia in rats after arterial injury BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Restenosis complicates a significant proportion of endovascular and open vascular procedures such as carotid endarterectomy. In contrast to the primary atheroma, restenosis is characterized by intimal hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells. We hypothesized that gamma radiation would reduce restenosis by limiting intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury.METHODS: To demonstrate the effect of gamma radiation on smooth muscle hyperplasia in vivo, a standardized bilateral carotid balloon catheter arterial injury was produced in 37 rats. A single dose of 750, 1500, or 2250 cGy (1cGy = 1 rad) gamma radiation was delivered to the right carotid artery at either 1 or 2 days after injury; the shielded contralateral carotid artery served as matched control. At 21 days after injury, vessels were perfusion-fixed in situ, and cross-sectional area of neointima was determined from axial sections using image analysis.RESULTS: Marked reductions in neointimal cross-sectional area were demonstrated in vessels subjected to 1500- and 2250-cGy radiation at both 1 and 2 days after injury. A less prominent effect was noted for 750 cGy, reaching statistical significance only at 2 days after injury. By two-way ANOVA, radiation dose (P = .0002), timing of radiation delivery (P = .003), and an interaction between timing and dose (P = .0278) were significantly associated with reduction in neointimal cross-sectional area. At 1500 cGy, delivery of radiation 1 day after injury inhibited neointimal hyperplasia more prominently than the same dose 2 days after injury; a dose-response relation was evident at 1 day.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation may be an important adjunctive therapy for reducing the incidence of restenosis after angioplasty or endarterectomy.",Included,0.9835633

The authors retrospectively reviewed their experience with 40 CS meningiomas treated with gamma knife radiosurgery.METHODS: Follow-up periods for the 40 patients ranged from 12 to 123 months (median 42 months), and the overall tumor control rates were 86.4% at 3 years and 82.3% at 10 years. Factors associated with tumor recurrence in univariate analysis were histological malignancy (p < 0.0001), partial treatment (p < 0.0001), suprasellar tumor extension (p = 0.0201), or extension in more than three directions outside the CS (p = 0.0345). When the tumor was completely covered with a dose to the margin that was higher than 14 Gy (Group A, 22 patients), no patient showed recurrence within the median follow-up period of 37 months. On the other hand, when a part of the tumor was treated with 10 to 12 Gy (Group B, 15 patients) or did not receive radiation therapy (Group C, three patients), the recurrence rates were 20% and 100%, respectively. Neurological deterioration was seen in nine patients, but all symptoms were transient or very mild.CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that stereotactic radiosurgery can control tumor growth if the whole mass can be irradiated by dosages of more than 14 Gy. When optimal radiosurgical planning is not feasible because of a tumor's large size, irregular shape, or proximity to visual pathways, use of limited surgical resection before radiosurgery is the best option and should provide sufficient long-term tumor control with minimal complications.",Excluded,0.10526523

Material(s) and Method(s): All patients with single BM who underwent surgical resection followed by IFRT at our institution from 2006 to 2013 were evaluated. Local recurrence (LR)-free survival, distant failure (DF)-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were determined. Analyses were performed associating clinical variables with LR and DF. Salvage approaches and toxicity of treatment for each patient were also assessed. Result(s): Median follow-up was 19.1 months. Fifty-six patients were treated with a median dose of 40.05 Gy/15 fractions with IFRT to the resection cavity. LR-free survival was 91.4%, DF-free survival was 68.4%, and OS was 77.7% at 12 months. No variables were associated with increased LR; however, melanoma histopathology and infratentorial location were associated with DF on multivariate analysis. LRs were salvaged in 5/8 patients, and DFs were salvaged in 24/29 patients. Two patients developed radionecrosis. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant IFRT is feasible and safe for well-selected patients with surgically resected single BM.

3932,"Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ameliorates radiation-induced ototoxicity in zebrafish and cochlea-derived cell lines Radiation is a widely used treatment for head and neck cancers, and one of its most severe side effects is ototoxicity. Radiation-induced ototoxicity has been demonstrated to be linked to the increased production of ROS and MAPK. We intended to investigate the effect of p38 inhibition on radiation-induced ototoxicity in cochlea-derived HEI-OC1 cells and in a zebrafish model. The otoprotective effect of p38 inhibition against radiation was tested in vitro in the organ of Corti-derived cell line, HEI-OC1, and in vivo in a zebrafish model. Radiation-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and an increase of intracellular NO generation were demonstrated in HEI-OC1 cells. The p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580, ameliorated radiation-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial injury in HEI-OC1 cells. p38 inhibition reduced radiation-induced activation of JNK, p38, cytochrome c, and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in HEI-OC1 cells. Scanning electron micrography showed that SB203580 prevented radiation-induced destruction of kinocilium and stereocilia in zebrafish neuromasts. The results of this study suggest that p38 plays an important role in mediating radiation-induced ototoxicity and inhibition of p38 could be a plausible option for preventing radiation ototoxicity.",Included,0.094543755

For this purpose, pregnant F344 rats were given a single administration of N-ethylnitrosourea (ENU) on gestational day 18. A total of 500 pups were divided into five groups, each composed of 50 males and 50 females: Group 1, untreated controls; Group 2, ENU alone; Groups 3 to 5, ENU + EMF (sham exposure and two exposure levels).

IUdR/MNPs were intravenously administered under a magnetic field (1.3 T) on day 13 after the implantation of C6 cells. After a day following the injection, rats exposed with radiation (8 Gy). ICP-OES analysis data indicated an effective magnetic targeting, leading to remarkably improved penetration through the BBB. In vivo release analysis with HPLC indicated sustained release of IUdR and, prolonged the lifespan in plasma (P <.01). In addition, our findings revealed a synergistic effect for IUdR/MNPs coupled with radiation, which significantly inhibited the tumor expansion (>100%), prolonged the survival time (>100%) and suppressed the anti-apoptotic response of glioma rats by increasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (2.13-fold) in compared with the radiation-only. In conclusion, besides high accumulation in targeted tumor sites, the newly developed IUdR/MNPs, also exhibited the ability of IUdR/MNPs to significantly enhance radiosensitizing effect, improve therapeutic efficacy and increase toxicity for glioma-bearing rats.

3937,"Clinical acceptability of SRS treatment of two simultaneous targets with varying magnitudes of rotation error Purpose/Objective(s): We investigated the target rotational errors (i.e., pitch, roll, yaw) and evaluated the dosimetric impact of simultaneous treatment ofmultiple brain lesionswith amono-isocentric technique of using image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery. The Elekta Synergy S with dissociated simultaneous multiple port (dose islands) within a single field. This simultaneous-treatment technique enables us to more efficiently treat two lesions concurrently when each target conforms to the radiosurgery protocol. Materials/Methods:We created a clinical reference plan (CRP), which has optimized dose coverage, conformity, homogeneity, and step-wise fall-off to zero dose.We then applied orthogonal-to-spherical coordinate system transformations about the isocenter, to each individual beam's parameters that simulated the multiple rotational errors for this research. For each patient (n = 10) 24 experimental treatment plan (ETP) calculations were. For each ETP , DVHs were computed for the two PTVs, optic nerves, optic chiasm and brainstem. From all of the DVH data, critical analytical indices were computed and compared to the CRP. These analytical indices include: Coverage, conformity, Dose Homogeneity, and Dose Gradient. A neurosurgical team evaluated the plans and subjectively evaluated the clinical suitability of each plan. The accumulated indices were scored and weighted to obtain a single value, the Unified Dosimetry Index (UDI). The UDI represents a plan's suitability vis-a-vis the CRP. Result(s): From the computed UDIs we observed that ETPs with 1-2 degrees of rotation remain within the defined range of suitability for clinical treatment. Rotation errors greater than 2 degrees resulted in UDI outside the clinically acceptable range. Conclusion(s): Isocenter rotations of 3 degrees or more significantly reduces the quality of clinical SRS treatments. Small lesions are especially vulnerable to loss of dosimetric coverage. SRS treatment setup should have a combined rotational error less than 2.5 degrees to effectively deliver the prescribed radiation dose using multiple brain lesions with mono-isocentric technique.",Excluded,0.08587898
3938,"Multisensory integration in the dorsal cochlear nucleus: unit responses to acoustic and trigeminal ganglion stimulation A necessary requirement for multisensory integration is the convergence of pathways from different senses. The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) receives auditory input directly via the VIIIth nerve and somatosensory input indirectly from the Vth nerve via granule cells. Multisensory integration may occur in DCN cells that receive both trigeminal and auditory nerve input, such as the fusiform cell. We investigated trigeminal system influences on guinea pig DCN cells by stimulating the trigeminal ganglion while recording spontaneous and sound-driven activity from DCN neurons. A bipolar stimulating electrode was placed into the trigeminal ganglion of anesthetized guinea pigs using stereotaxic co-ordinates. Electrical stimuli were applied as bipolar pulses (100 micros per phase) with amplitudes ranging from 10 to 100 microA. Responses from DCN units were obtained using a 16-channel, four-shank electrode. Current pulses were presented alone or preceding 100- or 200-ms broadband noise (BBN) bursts. Thirty percent of DCN units showed either excitatory, inhibitory or excitatory-inhibitory responses to trigeminal ganglion stimulation. When paired with BBN stimulation, trigeminal stimulation suppressed or facilitated the firing rate in response to BBN in 78% of units, reflecting multisensory integration. Pulses preceding the acoustic stimuli by as much as 95 ms were able to alter responses to BBN. Bimodal suppression may play a role in attenuating body-generated sounds, such as vocalization or respiration, whereas bimodal enhancement may serve to direct attention in low signal-to-noise environments.",Excluded,0.085734464
3939,"Skeletal muscle metastasis presenting as an initial manifestation of lung cancer INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer, the most common cancer worldwide, presents as a metastatic disease in majority of the cases. The most frequent sites of distant metastases are liver, adrenal glands, bones, and brain. Skeletal muscle metastasis as a mode of presentation of lung cancer is a rare phenomenon which is often discovered at autopsy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old male, with forty pack years history of smoking, presented with a painful right, distal thigh swelling for two months and unintentional weight loss of twenty pounds. Examination of right distal thigh revealed a tender, hard, non fluctuant mass, with surrounding erythema. Complete blood count, basic metabolic and hepatic function panel were unremarkable. Chest x ray showed large mass in right lower lobe with a smaller nodule in the right upper lobe which was confirmed by computed tomography ( CT) of the chest. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right lower extremity showed 5.5 x 4.0 x 6.2 cm soft tissue mass in lateral aspect of the distal thigh adjacent to femur. The patient underwent CT guided biopsies of the right lower lobe lung mass and the right thigh mass. Pathology of the lung mass revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (immunostaining positive for cytokeratin and thyroid transcription factor-1) and that of the right thigh mass revealed poorly differentiated malignant tumor most consistent with metastatic non small cell carcinoma (immunostaining positive for cytokeratin). Positron-emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) demonstrated hypermetabolic right lower lobe lung mass and right upper lobe lung nodule, a large right knee soft tissue mass and multiple hypermetabolic soft tissue lesions throughout the muscles of the body along with jugular, external iliac and inguinal hypermetabolic lymphadenopathies. The patient was started on palliative radiation to the right distal thigh. Chemotherapy was not administered due to rapidly deteriorating clinical status. The patient died of septic shock within 4 weeks of diagnosis. DISCUSSION: Skeletal muscle is an exceptionally rare site of metastasis of lung cancer(1). The local pH and the contractile property of skeletal muscle do not favor metastasis. Delay in the diagnosis may occur due to its clinical and radiological resemblance to diseases like abscess and soft tissue sarcoma. Definitive diagnosis requires biopsy of the muscle mass. Treatment is palliative, and majority of the patients die within 1 year of diagnosis (2,3) CONCLUSION(S): Lung cancer with skeletal muscle metastasis should be considered as a potential differential diagnosis in patients presenting with intramuscular mass.",Excluded,0.08713018
3940,"Radiosurgical Lesionectomy For Cavernomas Associated With Drug Resistant Epilepsy Purpose/Objective(s): Cavernous malformations (CMs) are congenital vascular malformations of the brain which cause hemorrhage and repetitive neurological deficits but the most frequent presenting symptom is epilepsy and is due to deposition of iron and blood products at the margin of the lesion. Microsurgical excision is preferred for cortical-subcortical epileptogenic CMs that are not located in functional cortex. For patients presenting with seizures arising from eloquent cortex surrounding the lesion, radiosurgery appears to be a suitable alternative. We evaluated the effectiveness of SRS in seizure cessation for drug-resistant seizures associated with CMs. Materials/Methods: This retrospective single center study where in 11 patients with cortical or subcortical CMs located in highly functional areas with severe long-term drug-resistant epilepsy underwent radiosurgery. The mean duration of epilepsy before these SRS procedures was 6yrs (+/-2.4) years. The mean frequency of seizures was 5 /month (+/-12). The mean marginal radiation dose was 18.5 Gy. Result(s): At median follow-up of 38mo, 54% were seizure free (Engel's class I), including 5 in class IA and 1 of the patients with occasional auras. A highly significant decrease in the number of seizures was achieved for 27% pts (class IIB). The remaining 19% patients showed little or no improvement. Outcomes were better for patients with simple partial seizures than for those with complex partial seizures. Location in the mesio-temporal region was associated with a poor outcome (2 of 11 patients), whereas location in the latero-temporal region was associated with a good outcome (5 of 11 patients). Location in the central region was also associated with an excellent outcome. Radiologically, 6 patients presented major reactional edema during the first year after SRS. In 2 of these patients, neuroradiological alterations were associated with clinical manifestations which included severe hemiparesis and speech impairment, but both patients fully recovered during the follow-up period with steroids. Post reactional edema correlates well with the response to the therapy. Conclusion(s): While radiosurgery role in controlling the bleeding in CM is controversial, it is a promising modality for epilepsy associated with CMs. The determination of the extent of the epileptogenic zone in CMs and dose selection are the critical steps towards successful radiosurgical outcome. Further prospective work is necessary. Copyright Â© 2020",Excluded,0.09244794
3941,"Thiol activation of endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15. A novel mechanism for the regulation of catalytic activity Endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15 (EP24.15) is a thermolysin-like metalloendopeptidase involved in the regulated metabolism of a number of neuropeptides. Unlike other thermolysin-like peptidases EP24.15 displays a unique thiol activation, a mechanism that is not clearly understood. In this study we show that both recombinant and tissue-derived EP24.15 are activated up to 8-fold by low concentrations (0.1 mM) of dithiothreitol. Additionally, under non-reducing conditions, recombinant and native EP24.15 forms multimers that can be returned to the monomeric form by reduction. We have also shown that competitive inhibitor binding occurs only to the monomeric form, which indicates that catalytic site access is restricted in the multimeric forms. Through systematic site-directed mutagenesis we have identified that cysteine residues 246, 253, and possibly 248 are involved in the formation of these multimers. Furthermore, both a double mutant (C246S/C253S) and a triple mutant (C246S/C248S/C253S) are fully active in the absence of reducing agents, as measured by both inhibitor binding and hydrolysis. The formation and disruption of disulfide bonds involving these cysteine residues may be a mechanism by which EP24.15 activity is regulated through changes in intra- and extracellular redox potential.",Excluded,0.08585226

Each of the forms of motor deprivation hindered the elaboration of DR; gamma-irradiation aggravated these disorders. At the same time, AOH led to significantly more severe disturbances in the higher nervous activity including the generalized excitation, pathologic aggressiveness and neurotization of animals. In contrast, hypokinesia stimulated the active elements of behavior which inhibit the passive-defensive behavior and a fear reaction.

3945,"Immune responses in the draining lymph nodes against cancer: Implications for immunotherapy Regional lymph nodes are the first site for melanoma metastases. The sentinel node (SN), on the direct lymphatic drainage pathway, which usually harbors first metastases, demonstrates significant suppression in its ability to respond to antigenic stimulation. This down-regulation of SN immunity is likely the basis of its susceptibility to tumor metastases, suggesting a potential role of the immune system in the control of malignant tumors. Despite immune dysfunction in the SN, phase II trials of systemic post-operative immunotherapy with a polyvalent melanoma vaccine developed at the John Wayne Cancer Institute showed improved 5-year overall survival in patients with melanoma metastatic to regional nodes. However, most immunotherapy clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a significant clinical response, and analyses of immune responses to tumor-associated antigens that correlate clinical responses have not been established. Therefore, refinements in assay methodologies and improvements in vaccine designs are critical to the success of cancer immunotherapy. Antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) is the most potent means to initiate a T cell immunity. Dendritic cell-based immunotherapies have been vigorously attempted in the past decade. To improve the immunogenicity of cancer vaccines, we recently generated heterokaryons of DCs and tumor cells by electrofusion. The fusion hybrids retained their full antigen-presenting capacity and all natural tumor antigens. In pre-clinical animal experiments, a single injection of the DC-tumor fusion hybrids was sufficient to mediate the regression of tumors established in the lung, skin and brain. Most interestingly, successful therapy required the delivery of fusion hybrids directly into lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes. A clinical trial is now being carried out to test the immunogenicity and therapeutic effects of fusion hybrids for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

3946,"Spatial learning and memory deficits induced by exposure to iron-56-particle radiation It has previously been shown that exposing rats to particles of high energy and charge (HZE) disrupts the functioning of the dopaminergic system and behaviors mediated by this system, such as motor performance and an amphetamine-induced conditioned taste aversion; these adverse behavioral and neuronal effects are similar to those seen in aged animals. Because cognition declines with age, spatial learning and memory were assessed in the Morris water maze 1 month after whole-body irradiation with 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/nucleon high-energy (56)Fe particles, to test the cognitive behavioral consequences of radiation exposure. Irradiated rats demonstrated cognitive impairment compared to the control group as seen in their increased latencies to find the hidden platform, particularly on the reversal day when the platform was moved to the opposite quadrant. Also, the irradiated group used nonspatial strategies during the probe trials (swim with no platform), i.e. less time spent in the platform quadrant, fewer crossings of and less time spent in the previous platform location, and longer latencies to the previous platform location. These findings are similar to those seen in aged rats, suggesting that an increased release of reactive oxygen species may be responsible for the induction of radiation- and age-related cognitive deficits.

Research by our group has shown that exposure to HZE particles, primarily 600 MeV/n and 1 GeV/n 56Fe, can produce significant alterations in brain neurochemistry and behavior. However, given that protons can make up a significant portion of the radiation spectrum, it is important to study their effects on neural functioning and on related performance. Therefore, these studies examined the effects of exposure to proton irradiation on neurochemical and behavioral endpoints, including dopaminergic functioning, amphetamine-induced conditioned taste aversion learning, and spatial learning and memory as measured by the Morris water maze.

Results showed that there was no effect of proton irradiation at any dose on any of the endpoints measured.

In this study, the relationship between the [ F]-FET-PET parameters, distribution of restricted (mainly intracellular) and unrestricted (mainly extracellular) sodium, and the mutational status of the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) were investigated in patients with cerebral gliomas. Methodik/Methods: Ten patients with untreated gliomas and one patient with a recurrent glioblastoma were investigated by dynamic [ F]-FETPET and sodium MRI using an enhanced SISTINA sequence to estimate sodium parameters in tumours. The enhanced SISTINA sequence uses single-quantum and triple-quantum-filtered imaging and allows simultaneous acquisition of signal originating from restricted and unrestricted sodium (1).

In order to define minimum dose requirements and the rotation correction capacity, a low dose BS MSCTA protocol was defined and evaluated in 12 patients in comparison to a common manual bone removal algorithm. Standard MIPs of both modalities were evaluated in a blinded manner by two neuroradiologists for image quality composed, of vessel contour sharpness and bony vessel superposition, by using a five-point score each. Effective Dose (E) and data post-processing times were defined.RESULTS: In experimental studies prescan tube current could be cut down to one-sixth of post-contrast scan doses without compromise of bone-subtraction whereas incomplete subtraction appeared from four degrees head malrotation on. Prescan E amounted to additional 1.1mSv (+25%) in clinical studies. BS MSCTA performed significantly superior in terms of bony superposition for vascular segments C3-C7 (p<0.001), V1-V2, V3-V4 (p<0.05, p<0.001 respectively) and the ophthalmic artery (p<0.05), whereas vessel contour sharpness in BS MSCTA only proved superior for arterial segments V3-V4 (p<0.001) and C3-C7 (p<0.001).

The rats were then followed and killed at various times afterward. Serotonin (5-HT) and its major metabolite 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) were assayed as well as prostaglandin synthesis. Microvessel permeability was assessed by quantitative evaluation of Evans blue dye extravasation.RESULTS: None of the rats developed neurologic dysfunction, and histologic examination revealed only occasional gliosis in the ventral white matter at 240 days after irradiation. Serotonin levels were unchanged at 2, 14, and 56 days after radiation but increased at 120 and 240 days in the irradiated cord segments when compared to both the nonirradiated thoracic and cervical segments (p < 0.01) and age-matched controls (p < 0.03). The calculated utilization ratio of serotonin (5-HIAA/5-HT) remained unchanged. Immediately after radiation (at 3 and 24 h) an abrupt but brief increase in the synthesis of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), thromboxane (TXB2), and prostacyclin [6 keto-PGF1 alpha (6KPGF)] was noted, which returned to normal at 3 days. This was followed after 7 and 14 days by a significant fall off in synthesis of all three prostaglandins. Thereafter, at 28, 56, 120, and 240 days, escalated production of thromboxane followed, while prostacyclin synthesis remained markedly reduced (-88% of control level at 240 days). Up to 7 days after radiation the calculated TXB2/6KPGF ratio remained balanced, regardless of the observed abrupt early fluctuations in their rate of synthesis. Later, between 7 and 240 days after radiation, a significant imbalance was present which became more pronounced over time. In the first 24 h after radiation, a 104% increase in microvessel permeability was observed which returned to normal by 3 days. Normal permeability was maintained at 14 and 28 days, but at 120 and 240 days a persistent and significant increase of 98% and 73% respectively above control level was noted.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation induces severe impairment in microvessel function even in the histologically unaffected spinal cord, and alters the secretory phenotype of various cell systems in the central nervous system.",Included,0.9843396

We assessed the e fficacy of a two-drug induction regimen, followed by transoral robotic assisted surgery (TORS) & neck dissection for locally advanced OPSCC. Method(s): This is an IRB approved single-arm phase II study for untreated stage III or IVA OPSCC patients (pts) with an ECOG < 2 and GFR > 50 cc. Induction chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and taxotere 75 mg/m2 every 21 days for 3 cycles. Tumor shrinkage was examined after each cycle. If the primary tumor was > 80% smaller, pts underwent TORS and neck dissection(s). At post-op visits, flexible laryngoscopy, blood work, and imaging with PET/CT and/or MRI were done. Short and long term toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated. Result(s): Nineteenpts were treated and 14 are available for analysis. Thirteen were male, 12 were Caucasian, 2 were African-American, and 13 were HPV+. Median age at diagnosis was 57. Tumors involved the tonsil (11 pts) and base of tongue (3 pts). Three pts were stage III, and 11 were stage IVA. Tumor size was reduced on average by 58%, 84% and 92% after the 1st, 2 and 3 induction cycles respectively. Pathologic complete remission of primary disease occurred in 11 pts and in 7 pts with cervical lymph node disease.

Adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed under far field conditions in a GTEM cell for 45 min each day for 10 days at an average whole-body specific energy absorption rate (SAR) of 0.05 W/kg.

Animals were tested in the maze immediately following exposure or after a delay of 15 or 30 min. No significant field-dependent effects on performance were observed in choice accuracy or in total times to complete the task across the experiment.

Improvement in the prognosis of these patients requires the development of new therapeutic approaches. One emerging strategy is to target aberrant cell metabolism, a trait shared by virtually all tumor cells. The ketogenic diet (KD), a high fat, low carbohydrate and protein metabolic therapy has demonstrated anti-tumor effects alone, and in combination with radiation. The KD prolongs survival in animal glioma models, and when used in conjunction with radiation 9 of 11micewere cured of their implanted tumors. We are now extending this work to determine if the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) radiosensitizes human GSCs in vitro. The effects of betaHB on growth were examined at various betaHB concentrations in two GSC lines, L0andL1. Both 5mM and 10 mM betaHB significantly reduced GSC growth. When coupled with 4Gy of radiation, 5mM betaHB treatment significantly reduced L1 neurosphere formation and frequency, more than either betaHB treatment or radiation alone. In L0, combination treatment significantly reduced neurosphere formation and frequency, more than radiation alone. To explore underlying mechanisms we are investigating the effect of betaHB on DNA damage and repair in GSCs. Additionally, we are determining the effect of betaHB on hypoxia within GSC neurospheres by analyzing expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha and the hypoxic marker carbonic anhydrase 9. We previously showed that the KD reduced the expression of these genes in a mouse glioma model. Taken altogether, these data suggest that betaHB may sensitize GBMs to radiation by inhibiting growth of both glioma cells and GSCs, which may have implications for its use to treat tumor recurrence.",Excluded,0.08611591

In this study, we examined the distribution of cells immunoreactive (ir) for calbindin-D28K (CaBP), calretinin (CR), parvalbumin, vasopressin-associated neurophysin (NP), substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and light-induced Fos-like protein. Previously unidentified cells in the core of the hamster SCN contained CaBP. Photic stimulation during the night induced Fos expression in about 75% of the CaBP-positive SCN cells, and about 50% of the Fos-positive cells in the core region expressed CaBP. These findings provide new information in the search for the cellular localization of pacemaker cells in the SCN, as photic input entrains the circadian system, and cells that receive photic input must be either part of the clock itself, or an upstream component of the clock.",Excluded,0.08612242

3963,"Interactions between intraspinal Schwann cells and the cellular constituents normally occurring in the spinal cord: an ultrastructural study in the irradiated rat Relationships between intraspinal Schwann cells and neuroglia, particularly, astrocytes, were studied following X-irradiation of the spinal cord in 3-day-old rats. Initially, this exposure results in a depletion of the neuroglial population. By 10 days post-irradiation (P-I), gaps occur in the glia limitans, although the overlying basal lamina remains intact. Development of and myelination by intraspinal Schwann cells is well underway by 15 days P-I. These Schwann cell-occupied regions have a paucity of astrocyte processes, a finding which persists throughout the study (60 days P-I), and several types of Schwann cell-neuroglial interfaces are observed, including: (1) astrocyte separation of Schwann cells from oligodendrocyte-myelinated regions; (2) intermingling of Schwann cell-myelinated axons and oligodendrocyte-myelinated axons in the absence of astrocyte processes; and (3) ensheathment of unmyelinated axons by astrocyte processes which separate these axons from the Schwann cells. The gaps in the glia limitans widen as the P-I interval increases. At 45 and 60 days P-I, the basal lamina no longer forms a singular, continuous covering over the spinal cord surface, but follows instead a rather tortuous course over the disrupted glia limitans and the intraspinal Schwann cells. Although the mode of initial occurrence of Schwann cells within the spinal cord is not yet understood, the data indicate that the astrocyte population is involved in that process, as well as in limiting the further development of Schwann cells within the substance of the spinal cord.",Excluded,0.98421544

The characteristics of CNS metastases and their response to crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NCSLC is unknown.We reviewed NSCLC patients with florescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) positive ALK rearrangement and CNS metastases at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. 29 patients (11 men, 38%) were identified, with a median age at initial CNS diagnosis of 50 (range 25-80). Brain metastases developed a median of 11 months (IQR 0.3-22) afterNSCLCdiagnosis, and were present at the initial cancer diagnosis in 10 (34%). 10 patients (34%) had > 4 brain lesions at initial CNS diagnosis. Median initial Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score at diagnosis of brain metastases was 80% (range 60-100). Leptomeningeal metastases developed following brain metastases in 6 patients (21%), at a median of 27 (range 20-82) months fromcancer diagnosis. Initial CNS-directed treatment included chemotherapy in 10 (34%), radiation followed by chemotherapy or TKI in 10 (34%), radiation only in 5 (17%), surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiation in 3 (10%), and palliative care in 1.

3967,"Optimizing cancer radiotherapy with 2-deoxy-D-glucose: Dose escalation studies in patients with glioblastoma multiforme Background and Purpose: Higher rates of glucose utilization and glycolysis generally correlate with poor prognosis in several types of malignant tumors. Own earlier studies on model systems demonstrated that the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) could enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy in a dose-dependent manner by selectively sensitizing cancer cells while protecting normal cells. Phase I/II clinical trials indicated that the combination of 2-DG, at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg body weight (BW), with large fractions of gamma-radiation was well tolerated in cerebral glioma patients. Since higher 2-DG doses are expected to improve the therapeutic gain, present studies were undertaken to examine the tolerance and safety of escalating 2-DG dose during combined treatment (2-DG + radiotherapy) in glioblastoma multiforme patients. Patients and Methods: Untreated patients with histologically proven glioblastoma multiforme (WHO criteria) were included in the study. Seven weekly fractions of <sup>60</sup>Co gamma-rays (5 Gy/fraction) were delivered to the tumor volume (presurgical CT/MRI evaluation) plus 3 cm margin. Escalating 2-DG doses (200-250-300 mg/kg BW) were administered orally 30 min before irradiation after overnight fasting. Acute toxicity and tolerance were studied by monitoring the vital parameters and side effects. Late radiation damage and treatment responses were studied radiologically and clinically in surviving patients. Result(s): Transient side effects similar to hypoglycemia were observed in most of the patients. Tolerance and patient compliance to the combined treatment were very good up to a 2-DG dose of 250 mg/kg BW. However, at the higher dose of 300 mg/kg BW, two out of six patients were very restless and could not complete treatment, though significant changes in the vital parameters were not observed even at this dose. No significant damage to the normal brain tissue was observed during follow-up in seven out of ten patients who received complete treatment and survived between 11 and 46 months after treatment. Conclusion(s): Oral administration of 2-DG combined with large fractions of radiation (5 Gy/fraction/week) is safe and could be tolerated in glioblastoma patients without any acute toxicity and late radiation damage to the normal brain. Further clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of the combined treatment are warranted. Â© Urban & Vogel.",Excluded,0.08619682
3968,"A method for recording miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the central nervous system suitable for quantal analysis Quantal analysis of transmitter release is useful in examining presynaptic mechanisms involved in synaptic transmission. However, in central neurons, the presence of multiple synapses makes it difficult to use the traditional quantal analysis, developed for the neuromuscular transmission. We developed a method to minimize these difficulties. Experiments were performed, using the whole-cell patch-clamp recording technique, on rat CA1 pyramidal neurons in a hippocampal slice preparation. When the stratum radiatum was stimulated, mixed current signals including, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) and evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs), could be observed in CA1 pyramidal cells while slices were superfused with the normal, Na(+)-containing, medium. The mIPSCs could be blocked by bicuculline (10 microm). mEPSCs, eEPSCs and eIPSCs could not be observed when the Na(+)-containing perfusion medium was replaced by a Na(+)-free medium but reappeared when the Na(+)-containing medium was re-introduced. When a polarizing electrode was placed near the recorded neuron, while slices were superfused with the Na(+)-free medium, and depolarizing rectangular current pulses of different magnitudes were applied, the number of mIPSCs increased with increasing amount of the current. Amplitudes of the mIPSCs showed a Gaussian distribution and the coefficient of variation was small. These observations indicate that a combination of the Na(+)-free superfusing medium and local depolarizations with a polarizing electrode is useful for recording mIPSCs from a localized area of the recorded neuron and for quantal analysis.",Excluded,0.08602464
3969,"Pericardial effusion and cardiac hypokinesis associated with longstanding, multi-organ system sarcoidosis Introduction: Sarcoidosis is a multi-organ system granulomatous disorder. Pericardial effusions associated with sarcoidosis are uncommon (19% of cases.) Case Report: A 54-year-old lady was diagnosed with sarcoidosis as a result of a breast biopsy in 2014 that revealed non-caseating granulomas. Since then, the patient has had chronic persistent dyspnea. Also, she has had involvement of cardiac muscle, her neurological system (unable to raise the left arm), spleen, lungs (stage 2, bilateral hilar adenopathy with infiltrates), and bony involvement of hands (arthritis and clubbing.) Often, patients with stage 2 sarcoidosis tend to go into remission spontaneously (40-70%.) In our patient's case, none of her multi-organ system manifestations abated. Up until this point, her lifelong condition has never been treated despite her symptoms because she refused corticosteroids. Superimposed on this patient were additional inflammatory diagnoses: Grave's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, treated lyme disease, second degree heart block, spinal meningitis, tick-borne alpha 1,3 galactose allergy. When we met the patient our focus was patient-centered education. We convinced our patient to accept steroid treatment because PET-MRI imaging may now detect scar vs. inflamed, viable tissue in her ventricle with enhanced sensitivity. Discussion(s): Newer-generation PET-MRI scans have ability to differentiate scar vs. inflammatory muscle with enhanced sensitivity. This improves clinical decision-making. Only 40-50% patients with cardiac sarcoidosis are diagnosed during their lifetime. To avert missed diagnoses, the advent of improved PET-MRI allows us to detect and treat cardiac sarcoidosis. It is incumbent to treat, because, if left untreated, the risk of sudden death from cardiac sarcoidosis is as high as 85%. Recent developments in PET technology reduce radiation dose. In our patient's situation, her decision to finally initiate therapy at age 54 was based on a patient-centered, empathic, compassionate explanation of the multi-system organ nature of her disease and the advantageous properties of PET-MRI to detect a treatable cause of dyspnea.",Excluded,0.085853904
3970,"Achieving sub cm CTV-PTV margin in pelvic treatments: Radiographers learning curve Aims: Image guidance is not always feasible or available for standard/ conformal treatments and so, offline portal image measurements help define population based CTV-PTV margins. Reproducibility in pelvis is aided by the use of ankle- and/or knee-indexed supports available in standard sizes generally suiting the needs of taller western patients. Radiographers need to be convinced of the importance for use of one/more positional devices as this adds to setup effort and time. Different permutations of aligning the pelvis and positional aids, resident supervised or not are reported for patients treated for cancer of the cervix/endometrium. Method(s): Patients were aligned using lasers/field lights to either anterior field center (conventional alignment) or to mid line tattoo over mons pubis keeping constant 10 cm table top to vertical height for all setups using either standard ankle or knee plus ankle positioning device. Localization CT scanbased digitally reconstructed radiographs were used as reference to compare with portal imaging acquired generally in pattern of 3 in 1st week and weekly thereafter. The van Herk formula was used to compute CTV-PTV margin from anterior and lateral image projections to give mediolateral (ML), cranio-caudal (CC) and antero-posterior (AP) margins. Result(s): The initial pelvic alignment were done in the presence of a resident doctor using ankle positioning by two different alignment methods: conventional and setup (4 cm cranial offset from reference tattoo at mons pubis). The corresponding PTV margin in ML direction was 1.6 cm versus 0.9 cm, CC 1.2 cm versus 1.1 cm respectively and in AP was identical at 0.7 cm. Subsequently, with radiographers by themselves, PTV margins were 1.1 cm versus 0.9 cm for ML, 1.1 cm versus 1.5 cm, CC and 1.0 cm versus 0.9 cm in AP direction for conventional and setup alignment respectively. An increase in CC margin was seen for setup arm. The radiographers were given feedback and setup reproducibility was assessed for next 13 patients treated with a similar setup protocol. The PTV margins for this group in CC showed improvement to 1.1 cm, ML was 0.9 cm and 0.9 cm in AP directions. A knee-positioning device was introduced with ankle for patient alignment with setup protocol. An increase in PTV margin to 1.4 cm was calculated for ML with modest decrease in CC at 0.8 cm and 0.9 cm for AP direction with use of two devices. The standard knee device was abandoned as use of two devices was perceived as cumbersome and unsuitable in height for patients. A third technique of alignment keeping treatment center at tattooed reference plane (mons pubis) using ankle device was studied. The PTV margins for ML, CC, AP directions were within a cm-0.8 cm, 0.9 cm, 0.9 cm respectively which is now the current practice. Conclusion(s): There is a radiographer learning curve.

3971,"Technological solutions to physiological problems: Dipas perspective Indian boundaries are delimited by diverse geographical locations ranging from frozen Himalayan peaks lacking oxygen to hot and dry deserts to hot and humid coastal areas to dense jungles. Indian soldiers are deployed in these varied environmental conditions and are subject to the detrimental effects of these extreme environmental excesses. In addition, the noise and radiation exposure of the troops is a significant occupational hazard. The troops of the Indian Defence Forces are not only expected to survive these extremes but also to perform physically and mentally to discharge their military duties effectively. DIPAS has been working in the field of military physiology for past fifty years with the primary mandate of promoting human performance in extreme environments. Neurophysiological mechanisms of anorexia, High Altitude Pulmonary Edema, cold injuries, memory impairment, sleep pattern at high altitude have been elucidated for developing preventive/therapeutic measures. We have undertaken various approaches to devise strategies and productsto improve performance of soldiers to combat physiological stresses posed by harsh environments. o Cold, hypoxic environment of High Altitude: For treating patients of AMS and HAPE and for persons visiting high altitude for shorter duration, a system for improving oxygenation is developed in the form of hyperoxic shelters. Nitric Oxide Delivery System for treatment of HAPE has also been optimized along with formulating Aloe Vera based Alocal cream to treat/prevent cold injuries. Acclimatization schedule and tenure of posting to aid in the rapid acclimatization of soldiers to high altitude has been prepared. We have also undertaken sleep studies for ameliorating the effects of sleep deprivation and disturbed sleep at the extremes of altitude. Electrically heated gloves and socks are developed for the extremely cold conditions at HA. Sourja, a self sustained solar shelter designed by DIPAS that can generate power in all weather conditions using solar/wind energy and provides zero energy based habitability under inhospitable environment. Improved Space Heating Devices (Bukhari) have been designed that uses nearly half fuel and does not build CO in the room where it is used, thus making it safe and cost effective. We have tailored Yoga packages for the Armed forces for their performance improvement. o Hot and dry/humid climate of Deserts/Coastal regions/Dense Tropical Jungles: Hypohydration and the resultant loss of water and electrolytes from the body are the major threats to human physiology in these environments. Soldiers need to acclimatize to the heat in order to survive in these border areas. DIPAS has designed Vortex cooling systems for desert operations to combat heat stress. Tanks provide a heated microclimate for the soldier operating in it, to provide comfort to the tank crew operating in extreme hot conditions, we made a solid state cooling garment for the tank crew. o Occupational stress environment: Soldiers are constantly exposed to high intensity noise of firing, aircrafts, tanks, etc and it is imperative to reduce the noise induced hearing loss to safeguard them.

We reported our experience treating a series of NF2-associated meningiomas with Gamma Knife (GK). Method(s): Between January 1992 and December 2008, 16 consecutive patients (7 male, 9 female, age 20 to 81) with 58 intracranial meningiomas were treated with single-fraction GK. Thirty-three tumors (57%) involved the convexity or parasagittal/falx, 25 (43%) skullbased. None of these meningiomas received prior surgery. Nine patients (56%) had more than 1 meningoma (range, 2 to 4) at presentation. Six patients (38%) also had intraspinal meningiomas which were never treated by radiation. All patients had bilateral (81%) or unilateral (19%) vestibular schwannomas. During follow-up, 6 patients (38%) developed 26 (46%) new intracranial meningomas, termed distant progression, requiring secondary treatments. The median prescription dose was 16 Gy (range, 13 to 20), with a maximum dose of 32 Gy (range, 24 to 40). The median heterogeneity index was 2 (range, 1.3 to 2.5). The median tumor diameter and prescription isodose volume were 2.3 cm and 3.6 cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) between GK shots per tumor (median 4, range 1 to 22) versus tumor volume was 0.59. The median radiographic and clinical followup periods were 62 and 86 months, respectively. Result(s): Over a median follow-up period of 3.1 years (range, 0.4 to 14.6), ten patients (63%) required only one treatment, and 6 (37%) required 1 to 6 additional treatments for distant progression. Fifteen (93.8%) patients were alive at last follow-up, with fifty-five tumors (94.8%) controlled (smaller or unchanged in size). Three in-field tumors (5.2%) became larger at 36, 56 and 82 months, respectively, but were not re-treated; they belonged to the same patient who had 14 meningomas treated over 7 times (in 12.7 y). There were no marginal failures. The median time to first radiographic distant progression was 13.7 months (range, 6.2 to 77.5). One minor complication was noted at 12 months, with hemi-body sensory changes which resolved. Two major radiation-related complications occurred at 1 and 3 months, including a 34-year-old woman who died following GK for a parasagittal meningioma. GK-related complication rates remained low overall, and were not associated with tumor volume, location, prescription dose, or chosen isodose level. Conclusion(s): GK is an effective treatment for NF2 patients with meningoma, with 5-year local control rate greater than 90% in our series. Side effects are rare but can be life-threatening including radionecrosis, which may occur within three months after treatment. For NF2 patients who developed distant progression and required repeat treatments elsewhere intracranially, secondary GK appeared safe and equally successful when compared with primary treatment. No high-grade meningoma or secondary non-meningioma malignancy were found as a result of GK radiation exposure.",Excluded,0.09114916

3976,"Comparison of Neutron Organ and Effective Dose Coefficients for PIMAL Stylized Phantoms in Bent Postures in Cranial and Caudal Irradiation Geometries ABSTRACT: Radiation dose estimations in the human body are performed using computational reference phantoms, which are anatomical representations of the human body. In previous studies, dose reconstructions have been performed focusing primarily on phantoms in an upright posture, which limits the accuracy of the dose estimations for postures observed in realistic work settings. In this work, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 103 recommendations for monoenergetic neutron plane sources directed downward from above the head (cranial) and upward from below the feet (caudal) for adult female and male reference phantoms were used to calculate organ absorbed and effective dose coefficients. The Phantom with Moving Arms and Legs (PIMAL) and the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) radiation transport code were used to compute organ-absorbed dose and effective dose coefficients for the upright, half-bent (45degree), and full-bent (90degree) phantom postures. The doses calculated for each of the articulated positions were compared to those calculated for the upright posture by computing the ratios of the coefficients (45degree/upright and 90degree/upright). These ratios were used to assess the effectiveness of upright phantoms in providing a comparable estimate when conducting dose estimations and dose reconstructions for articulated positions. This work compiling neutron cranial and caudal posture-specific dose coefficients completes the series of dose coefficients computed for posture-specific ICRP Publication 116 irradiation geometries for monoenergetic photons and neutrons, in addition to cranial and caudal monoenergetic photons. Results reported demonstrated that organ-absorbed dose coefficients for most of the organs in the CRA and CAU irradiation geometries were significantly higher for the bent phantoms than for the upright phantom. Since the upright phantom underestimates the organ-absorbed dose, this demonstrates the impact of posture while performing dose calculations. Organ doses reported in past neutron dose coefficient data were found to omit effects from neutron resonances at energies of 0.435, 1.0, and 3.21 MeV from 16O in tissue. Reported data notes as high as 60% underestimation for neutron organ-absorbed doses, specifically at the neutron resonance energy region omitted by smoothing. Ongoing studies are examining the effect of resonances on reported neutron organ-absorbed dose coefficients in ICRP 116 geometries.",Excluded,0.086710334

3980,"Radiotherapeutic management of vestibular schwannomas using size- and location-adapted fractionation regimens to maximize the therapeutic ratio BACKGROUND: We evaluated and compared the radiographic and clinical outcomes of patients with vestibular schwannomas treated with single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), 5 fractions of hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (hSRT), or 25 to 30 fractions of conventionally fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (cfSRT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-six patients treated with LINAC-based SRS (median, 12.5 Gy), hSRT (25 Gy), or cfSRT (median, 54 Gy) were retrospectively reviewed. Fractionation was based on the size of the tumor, proximity to the brainstem, and potential risk of neurological sequelae. Median follow-up time was 55.2 months.RESULTS: The pretreatment median tumor diameter was significantly smaller for SRS (1.14 cm) compared with hSRT (1.7 cm) (P = .03) and cfSRT (2.0 cm) (P < .001). The overall local tumor control was 96.4%: 100% SRS, 100% hSRT, and 90% cfSRT (P = .19). Tumor regression was observed in 53.3% of SRS, 76.2% of hSRT, and 90% of cfSRT (P = .05). There was less transient expansion of tumors treated with cfSRT (5%) than with SRS (53.3%) or hSRT (28.6%) (P = .005). The median time to regression was 13.8 months for SRS, 14.2 months for hSRT, and 5.5 months for cfSRT (P = .34). There was a 3.6% incidence of grade 3 trigeminal neuropathy, but there was no grade 3 facial neuropathy.CONCLUSIONS: All 3 regimens demonstrated similar excellent local control with minimal toxicity; however, the ability of hSRT to treat larger tumors with comparable outcomes to SRS and greater patient convenience when compared with cfSRT suggest that hSRT may offer the optimal treatment approach.",Excluded,0.09060003
3981,"Effects of lesions in some basal ganglia nuclei and efferent projections on tremorine-induced limb rigidity in rats A mechanical apparatus was used to measure in rats the effects of some unilateral basal ganglia lesions on the hind-limb rigidity produced by the cholinomimetic compound, tremorine. A globus pallidus lesion reduced the resting tone and greatly increased rigidity in the contralateral leg. Lesions in the entopeduncular, subthalamic, and accumbens nuclei had no effects on rigidity, although the entopeduncular nucleus lesion reduced resting limb tone. The role of the globus pallidus in rigidity is significant in relation to work in which striatal lesions abolished tremorine-induced rigidity. Some brain regions that receive basal ganglia efferent fibers received a lesion unilaterally. Lesions in the substantia nigra, red nucleus, or pedunculopontine nucleus had no effect on tremorine-induced rigidity. A habenular lesion significantly reduced rigidity in both hind legs. Very pronounced reductions in rigidity occurred after midbrain lesions involving the central periaqueductal grey region and the superior colliculus. The basal ganglia output pathways that may mediate tremorine rigidity are discussed, together with the possibility that the superior colliculus, which has many muscarinic receptors, may be influenced directly by tremorine.",Excluded,0.08791394
3982,"Cancer pain (classification and pain syndromes) Inspite the new informations about the physiology and biochemistry of pain, it remains true that pain is only partially understood. Cancer pain is often experienced as several different types of pain, with combined somatic and neuropathic types the most frequently. If the acute cancer pain does not subside with initial therapy, patients experience pain of more constant nature, the characteristics of wich vary with the cause and the involved sites. Chronic pain related to cancer can be considered as tumor-induced pain, chemotherapy-induced pain, and radiation therapy-induced pain. Certain pain mechanisms are present in cancer patients. These include inflammation due to infection, such as local sepsis or the pain of herpes zoster, and pain due to the obstruction or occlusion of a hollow organ, such as that caused by large bowel in cancer of colon. Pain also is commonly due to destruction of tissue, such as is often seen with bony metastases. Bony metastases also produce pain because of periostal irritation, medullary pressure, and fractures. Pain may be produced by the growth of tumor in a closed area richly supplied with pain receptors (nociceptors). Examples are tumors growing within the capsule of an organ such as the pancreas. Chest pain occurring after tumor of the lung or the mediastinum due to invasion of the pleura. Certain tumors produce characteristic types of pain. For example, back pain is seen with multiple myeloma, and severe shoulder pain and arm pain is seen with Pancoast tumors. [References: 42]",Excluded,0.08728439
3983,"Phase i trial of genetically modified hematopoetic progenitor cells facilitating bone marrow chemoprotection and enabling TMZ/o6bg dose escalation resulting in improved survival INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor with a median survival of 15 months despite surgery and aggressive radio-chemotherapy. The most important mechanism of TMZ resistance is the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene which repairs temozolamide-induced DNA methylation. The MGMT inhibitor O6-benzylguanine (BG) has demonstrated efficacy in depleting MGMT and maximizing tumor response in early phase clinical trials. However, because MGMT expression is also low in hematopoietic cells, this has resulted in unacceptable bone marrow toxicity, and this approach has been abandoned. We hypothesized that chemoprotection of hematopoieticprogenitor cells (HPC) with an MGMT mutant (MGMT-P140K) characterized by normal methyltransferase activity coupled with low affinity for BG, would maximize anti-tumor response while enabling patients to tolerate TMZ & BG dose escalation with minimal toxicity. We thus performed a phase I trial to test this hypothesis. METHOD(S): We treated 7 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed GBM with standard surgery and radiation, followed by transplantation with autologous CD34+hematopoetic progenitor cells engineered to express MGMT-P140K using a lentiviral vector in three arms. To assess chemo-protection, patients' blood counts and transgene marking were monitored during the treatment as was tumor growth and survival. RESULT(S): The viral transduction rates were 2.5-75% and were clearly improved in the third arm with intra-patient dose escalation. P140K-MGMT gene markings in peripheral blood and bone marrow cells increased 3-26- fold with only mild-moderate (Grade 2-3) mylosuppression consistent with chemo-selection and chemo-protection as hypothesized. Survival ranged from 20-36 months which exceeded their RPA predicted survival by 1.9- 3.2 fold suggesting clinical benefit (mean 2.0). Viral insertion site analysis failed to demonstrate evidence of clonal dominance. CONCLUSION(S): These preliminary result demonstrates that this chemoprotection strategy is tolerable, safe, and facilitates TMZ & BG dose escalation resulting in increased survival in a small cohort of selected patients.

3984,"Thoracic radiotherapy of SCLC Limited stage: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) comprises 10-15% of all lung tumors and is associated with an aggressive clinical behavior. Two out of three patients presents with hematogenous metastases at diagnosis (extensive stage (ES)). For patients without hematogenous metastases (limited stage (LS)), chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment. Although radiotherapy after chemotherapy has the theoretical benefit of treating smaller target volumes with less toxicity, concurrent chemoradiotherapy has shown to be superior. Moreover, earlier use of radiotherapy during chemotherapy leads to better results. The absolute benefit of early versus late radiotherapy was about 10% for patients who had received cisplatinum-based chemotherapy.1 Turrisi et al.2 demonstrated that twice daily radiotherapy starting with a first course of chemotherapy resulted in improved survival rates. Median survival was 23 months for patients who received twice-daily radiotherapy (45 Gy/30 fractions/3 weeks) versus 19 months for once daily treated patients (45 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks). The corresponding 5 years survival rates were 26% and 16%. However, more Grade 3-4 oesophagitis was seen during twice-daily treatment (32% versus 16%). Only a minority of patients in the US and Europe receive twice daily radiotherapy. Recently the results of the CONVERT trial, in which once-daily radiotherapy (70Gy) was compared with twice daily radiotherapy (45 Gy) were presented.3 Radiotherapy was initiated at the 2nd course of 4-6 cycles of cisplatin/etoposide. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two arms. Overall survival at 2 years was 56% for patients treated twice-daily versus 51% for patients treated once-daily (p= 0.15).3 There was also no significant difference in time to progression. There were no differences in a acute toxicity, except for Grade 3-4 neutropenia, which occurred more often in the twicedaily treatment arm (74% versus 65%). There were no differences in Grade 3-5 oesophagitis (19%) and pneumonitis (2%). The authors concluded that survival in both study arms was higher than reported previously and that radiation related toxicities were lower than expected, probably related to the use of modern radiotherapy techniques. The results of the study support the use of either twice daily or once daily as standard of care for patients with limited stage disease and in good performance score. In RTOG0538 study, which also compares 70 Gy once-daily and 45 Gy twice-daily radiotherapy, radiotherapy commences with the first or second course of chemotherapy. The results of this study are eagerly awaited.4 Extensive stage: In the EORTC study on prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for ES-SCLC, it was noted that the vast majority of patients still had intrathoracic disease after completion of chemotherapy. After on the positive effects of PCI which not only reduced the risk of symptomatic brain metastases (40 versus 15%) but also improved overall survival (1 year: 27 versus 13% (P= 0,003)),5 the next logical step was to investigate the use of thoracic radiotherapy in ES-SCLC as well. Evidence for a possible role of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) in ESSCLC also comes from the results of a trial published by Jeremic et al. in 19996 in which patients with ES-SCLC and good prognosis with a complete response outside the thorax were randomized between TRT plus PCI during chemotherapy versus chemotherapy and PCI only. Overall survival was 17 months for the patients who received thoracic radiotherapy versus 11 months for those who did not. In the CREST trial, patients with ES-SCLC and any response after 4-6 cycles of platinum based chemotherapy were randomized between PCI plus TRT (30Gy/10 fractions) or PCI only. Overall survival at one year, the primary endpoint of the study, was not statistically significant between the groups (p=0.066) but with longer follow up the survival curves diverged and at 2 years, survival was 13% in patients who received TRT versus 3% in the controls (p=0,004). There was also significant dif erence in progression free survival. In an additional analysis of patients with and without residual intrathoracic disease, which was one of the stratification factors of the study, it was demonstrated that there was no significant benefit of TRT in patients with a CR in the thorax. However, in patients with residual intrathoracic disease after chemotherapy, TRT led to a significant improvement in overall survival. 7 In patients who received thoracic radiotherapy the risk of intrathoracic recurrence was reduced from 80% to 44%. In patients who received thoracic radiotherapy the most recurrences occurred outside the brain and the thorax and at a later stage. The next logical step after demonstration of a beneficial effect of PCI and TRT would be the use of higher doses for TRT and possibly also treatment of extrathoracic metastatic sites. This topic was addressed in the NRG-RTOG0937 study and was presented at ASTRO 2015.8 patients with ES-SCLC and a CR or PR after chemotherapy and 1-4 metastatic lesions were randomized between PCI or PCI plus TRT plus radiotherapy of metastatic sites. The study which accrued very slowly was closed early due to observed toxicities. The study did not show a survival difference between the two groups, but included only 86 patients over a five years period and had imbalance groups with worse prognostic factors in the experimental arm. There were many, partly unrelated, Grade 4-5 toxicities in the experimental arm. To define which patients are most likely to benefit from a more aggressive approach we have performed an additional analysis for patients from the top accruing centers from the CREST trial. An evaluation of 260 patients showed significantly better outcome in patients with 0 to 2 metastases versus and without liver metastases.10 These patients are believed to be best candidates for future studies.",Excluded,0.14265066
3985,"Revolution in Radiation In the past few decades, there have been many changes in the field of radiotherapy. These include better imaging, better motion management, improvements in treatment planning, better position verification and more precise treatment delivery. This has led to an increased use of radiotherapy and to significant improvements in clinical outcome. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT, aka SABR) is currently the standard of care for patients with medically inoperable stage I NSCLC. The technique is now safely used for more centrally located, larger and multiple lesions as well. SBRT is increasingly being considered as an alternative to surgery in operable patients. The results of two randomized clinical trials which were closed prematurely due to poor accrual, suggest equivalence between SBRT and surgery. Comparative effectiveness studies point in the same direction. New randomized trials on this topic are currently recruiting. In stage III NSCLC, radiotherapy can also be delivered with increased precision. Although the use of much higher dose has not (yet) led to better outcomes, the newer radiation techniques are associated with less toxicity and over the years, there has been a steady improvement in control and survival rates. The use of immunotherapy in combination with radiotherapy holds many promises. The role of proton therapy is still investigational. For patients with oligometastatic disease or oligoprogression, local treatments including radiotherapy can be highly effective and may lead to long term control and improvements in survival. We are awaiting the results of randomized studies to unequivocally show this benefit. In LS-SCLC, there is still discussion on the schemes for thoracic radiotherapy (BID or QD). The improvement in median survival in both arms of the recent CONVERT trial compared to earlier studies are probably exemplary for the general improvements in radiotherapy techniques. In ES-SCLC patients, thoracic radiotherapy is advocated for those patients with a response after chemotherapy but with residual disease in their chest. In ES-SCLC, prophylactic cranial irradiation is nowadays sometimes replaced with MRI-surveillance. Delayed cranial irradiation is than used in about two out of three patients. An important breakthrough in radiotherapy is the introduction of MRI guidance on the linear accelerator. This not only provides better soft-tissue imaging, but also for the first time, continuous imaging during the delivery of the treatment. The anatomical information from the MRI made daily with the patient on the treatment couch can be used to daily adapt the treatment plan. This allows for the use of smaller margins and early results demonstrate important benefits, especially in high-risk patients.

3987,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation in extensive disease small-cell lung cancer: Short-term health-related quality of life and patient reported symptoms-results of an international phase III randomized controlled trial by the EORTC radiation oncology and lung cancer groups Purpose Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients with extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) leads to significantly fewer symptomatic brain metastases and improved survival. Detailed effects of PCI on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are reported here. Patients and Methods Patients (age, 18 to 75 years; WHO <= 2) with ED-SCLC, and any response to chemotherapy, were randomly assigned to either observation or PCI. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and patient-reported symptoms were secondary end points. The European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer core HRQOL tool (Quality of Life Questionnaire C30) and brain module (Quality of Life Questionnaire Brain Cancer Module) were used to collect self-reported patient data. Six HRQOL scales were selected as primary HRQOL end points: global health status; hair loss; fatigue; and role, cognitive and emotional functioning. Assessments were performed at random assignment, 6 weeks, 3 months, and then 3-monthly up to 1 year and 6-monthly thereafter. Results Compliance with the HRQOL assessment was 93.7% at baseline and dropped to 60% at 6 weeks. Short-term results up to 3 months showed that there was a negative impact of PCI on selected HROOL scales. The largest mean difference between the two arms was observed for fatigue and hair loss. The impact of PCI on global health status as well as on functioning scores was more limited. For global health status, the observed mean difference was eight points on a scale 0 to 100 at 6 weeks (P = .018) and 3 months (P = .055). Conclusion PCI should be offered to all responding ED SCLC patients. Patients should be informed of the potential adverse effects from PCI. Clinicians should be alert to these; monitor their patients; and offer appropriate support, clinical, and psychosocial care. Â©2008 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded,0.9675707
3988,"Radiosensitivity and differentiation of ganglion cells within fetal mouse retinal explants in vitro Fetal mouse retinas were explanted at 13-14 days of gestation, and exposed to gamma radiation in vitro. Not all regions of the retina were equally susceptible to radiation-induced necrosis; when exposed to 5000 rads soon after explanation, each explant had a single small radioresistant nubbin of apparently intact tissue, located near the optic nerve-head. This region of radioresistant tissue was larger when the dose of radiation was reduced and when the explants were exposed at later times in vitro, indicating the existence of a gradient of radioresistance across retinal explants which spread outward through at least the first week in vitro, the period examined. Based upon the extensive in situ literature which has correlated the emergence of radioresistance with the differentiation of retinal neurons, we conclude that the in situ central-to-peripheral sequence of cellular differentiation continues in vitro within our retinal explants. Whereas the ganglion cell axonal outgrowth from control retinas grown in isolation on collagen substrates underwent a gradual disintegration over 3 weeks in vitro, the sparse axonal outgrowth from explants exposed to 5000 rads disintegrated abruptly at 5-7 days in vitro. This did not appear to be due to direct damage from radiation, but instead reflected the fact that axons in irradiated cultures arose from central retinal regions only, while many axons in control cultures emerged from later-differentiating peripheral regions. We suggest that disintegration of individual axons in the outgrowth may occur rapidly and in a central-to-peripheral sequence. These findings should be useful in designing assays for trophic factors which may prevent ganglion cell axon disintegration in this in vitro model system.",Excluded,0.97376955
3989,"Perception of sniff phase in mouse olfaction Olfactory systems encode odours by which neurons respond and by when they respond. In mammals, every sniff evokes a precise, odour-specific sequence of activity across olfactory neurons. Likewise, in a variety of neural systems, ranging from sensory periphery to cognitive centres, neuronal activity is timed relative to sampling behaviour and/or internally generated oscillations. As in these neural systems, relative timing of activity may represent information in the olfactory system. However, there is no evidence that mammalian olfactory systems read such cues. To test whether mice perceive the timing of olfactory activation relative to the sniff cycle ('sniff phase'), we used optogenetics in gene-targeted mice to generate spatially constant, temporally controllable olfactory input. Here we show that mice can behaviourally report the sniff phase of optogenetically driven activation of olfactory sensory neurons. Furthermore, mice can discriminate between light-evoked inputs that are shifted in the sniff cycle by as little as 10 milliseconds, which is similar to the temporal precision of olfactory bulb odour responses. Electrophysiological recordings in the olfactory bulb of awake mice show that individual cells encode the timing of photoactivation in relation to the sniff in both the timing and the amplitude of their responses. Our work provides evidence that the mammalian olfactory system can read temporal patterns, and suggests that timing of activity relative to sampling behaviour is a potent cue that may enable accurate olfactory percepts to form quickly.",Excluded,0.08584601

Hyperthermia for 30 min at a spinal cord temperature of 41.1, 42.3, and 42.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C was applied 5 to 10 min after irradiation by means of a 434 MHz microwave applicator. Animals were observed for 21 months while recording myelopathy and development of tumors.RESULTS: The latent period for hind leg paralysis decreased with increasing radiation dose from 359 +/- 31 days (n = 9) after 20 Gy to 200 +/- 4 days (n = 5) after 32 Gy. Hyperthermia enhanced the radiation response of the lumbosacral spinal cord as evidenced by shortening of the latent period for paralysis and a decrease in the biological effective dose. After 20 Gy followed by 30 min 41.1 degrees C, latency was diminished to 214 +/- 16 days (n = 7, p < 0.001 vs. 20 Gy alone). The ED50 was 21.1 Gy, which was diminished to values between 16 and 17 Gy if radiation was followed by hyperthermia, giving a thermal enhancement ratio between 1.24 and 1.32. Histopathological examination of the spinal cord after combined treatment of x-rays and hyperthermia showed necrosis of nerve roots. Irradiation with 16, 20, 24, and 28 Gy (n = 77) alone led to tumor induction in 17 +/- 8% of the animals (pooled data). If followed by hyperthermia (n = 96), it was increased to 33 +/- 12% (p < 0.01). Most tumors induced by radiation and hyperthermia were sarcomas.CONCLUSION: First, the radiation response of rat lumbosacral spinal cord was enhanced by heat.

3991,"Prophylactic hyperbaric oxygen treatment and rat spinal cord re-irradiation Normal tissue injury may lead to severe, life threatening, late side effects after therapeutic use of irradiation. Neurological complications caused by radiation of the spinal cord are ascribed to progressive, irreversible damage to the vasculature. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is known to induce angiogenesis in irradiated tissue and has been proven to reduce late radiation injury in several normal tissues when applied during the latent period before complications become manifest. In the present study: (1) the prophylactic potential of HBO; (2) optimal timing of HBO therapy after spinal cord irradiation, i.e. during the latent period; and (3) effect of HBO on the re-irradiation tolerance of the spinal cord were investigated. The rat cervical spinal cord was locally X-ray irradiated with ten fractions of 6.5 Gy in 11 days. Five treatment groups (n=10) included: irradiation alone and irradiation followed by 30 HBO treatments (100% oxygen at 240 kPa for 90 min) during latency, with HBO starting either immediately, 5, 10 or 15 weeks after the primary irradiation course. One year after the primary treatment, the same spinal cord volume was re-irradiated with 20 Gy single dose. During life span, the animals were observed on the incidence of myelitis and the duration of the latent period. The actuarial analysis revealed no significant difference in neurological complications free survival between the irradiation alone and the irradiation+HBO treatment groups. A tendency towards radiosensitization was found in the group in which the primary irradiation course was immediately followed by the HBO treatment course. The data show that HBO applied during the latent period of progressively developing irradiation damage to the spinal cord does not increase the re-irradiation tolerance of this tissue.

This project evaluates one of these screen protectors' ability to reduce blue light intensity.METHODS: The intensity of light at 450 nm from an iPhone 8, iPhone X, and iPad was measured in a dark room. The averages of three measurements were taken with and without the screen protector at different distances, settings of brightness, and Apple's night shift (NS) mode. Results were analyzed using paired t-tests.RESULTS: At 33 cm, 100% brightness, and 0% NS, the screen protector decreased intensity by 43.9%, 32.3%, and 34.9% for the iPhone 8, iPhone X, and iPad, respectively. At 33 cm and 100% brightness, increasing NS mode from 0% to 100% decreased intensity by 81.2%, 84.2%, and 86.5%.

3994,"Arachidonic acid potentiates acid-sensing ion channels in rat sensory neurons by a direct action Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are activated by a decrease in extracellular pH. ASICs are expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons, and several lines of evidence suggest that they are responsible for signaling the pain caused by extracellular acidification, but little is understood of the modulation of ASICs by pro-inflammatory factors. Using whole-cell patch clamp we demonstrate that low pH evokes three distinct inward currents in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons: a slowly inactivating transient current, a rapidly inactivating transient current, and a sustained current. All three currents were potentiated by arachidonic acid (AA), to 123%, 171%, and 264% of peak current, respectively. Membrane stretch had no effect on proton-gated currents, implying that AA is unlikely to act via local membrane deformation. The current carried by heterologously expressed ASIC1a and ASIC3 was also potentiated by AA. AA potentiates ASIC activation by a direct mechanism, because inhibition of AA metabolism had no effect on potentiation, and potentiation of single ASIC2a channels could be observed in cell-free patches. Potentiation by lipids with the same chain length as AA increased as the number of double bonds was increased. AA is known to be released in inflammation and the results suggest that AA may be an important pro-inflammatory agent responsible for enhancing acid-mediated pain.",Excluded,0.085759714

The physician's role may include informing the patient of the diagnosis, helping with decisions about treatment, providing psychological support, treating intercurrent disease, continuing patient-appropriate preventive care, and recognizing and managing or comanaging complications of cancer and cancer therapies. Adverse effects of therapy and cancer-related symptoms include nausea, febrile neutropenia, pain, fatigue, depression, and emotional distress. 5-Hydroxytryptamine antagonists are effective in controlling acute nausea associated with chemotherapy. Febrile neutropenia requires systematic evaluation and early empiric antibiotics while awaiting culture results. Cancer-related pain, depression, and fatigue often are underdiagnosed and undertreated. Use of brief screening tools for assessing fatigue and emotional distress can improve management of these symptoms. Exercise prescription, activity management, and psychosocial interventions are useful in treating cancer-related fatigue.

3998,"Photopigment self-screening and the determination of macular pigment absorbance using heterochromatic flicker photometry PURPOSE: Heterochromatic flicker photometry (HFP) is commonly used to determine macular pigment optical density (MPOD). Since HFP in this application is a locus comparison method, an identical relative spectral response at each locus is required for a perfect measure. We know this requirement cannot be strictly true since the optical density of photopigments increases as the foveal center is approached. Thus, the self-screening effect would result in an underestimate of MPOD. An earlier study concluded that the underestimate is on the order of 30%. We examined this issue by manipulating photopigment optical density, and consequently the degree of selfscreening.METHODS: A continuously exposed, 470 nm, background bleached cone photopigments over a range from 0 to 80%. MPOD was determined 10' and 30' from the foveal center. Two subjects were used in the main experiment. Five additional subjects were studied with just the 0% and 80% bleach levels. Spectral measures were obtained at 0% and 70% bleach levels for the two primary subjects.RESULTS: Subjects in the main experiment showed MPOD estimates that increased with increasing bleaching. The effect, however, was small: one observer's MPOD increased 0.08 and 0.02 for the 10' and 30' loci, respectively; the other observer's values were 0.04 and 0.01 for the same loci. Comparable values were obtained for the other five subjects using the 0% and 80% bleach conditions. Spectral measures were consistent with the findings of the main experiment.CONCLUSIONS: When self-screening is nearly abolished (80% bleach), a relatively small underestimation is revealed for the unbleached state. For the 1degree target we show about 2-3% underestimation. Our 20' target reveals a larger underestimate (8-9%), consistent with longer photoreceptor outer-segments nearer the foveal center. We conclude that HFP yields values essentially independent of self-screening for targets of 1degree diameter or greater. Smaller targets are less than 10% underestimated for near-zero bleach conditions.",Excluded,0.08592759

Participants received the following interventions: 40 zygapophyseal joint injections, 33 medial branch nerve blocks, 113 transforaminal epidural injections, and 16 combined zygapophyseal joint injections and epidural injections. Gender, procedure number, and procedure type did not differ between groups. The overweight group demonstrated a 30% increase in mean fluoroscopy time and a 35% increase in mean procedure time. Controlling for other variables, we found that differences in fluoroscopy time and procedure time were significant (P = .032 and P = .031, respectively) between the 2 groups.CONCLUSIONS: Significantly prolonged procedure time and fluoroscopy time in overweight patients increase the risks associated with spine interventions, not only to the patients but also to the operating room staff exposed to ionizing radiation.",Excluded,0.2727525

4001,"Light delays synaptic deafferentation and potentiates the survival of axotomized retinal ganglion cells Knowledge of the cellular mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of stimulation and the optimal doses of such stimulation to maximize neuronal recovery is essential to guide clinical practice in neural rehabilitation. Using hamsters, we transected the optic nerve to demonstrate how light stimulation affects neuronal recovery. The c-fos protein was used as a neuronal connectivity marker. Here we show that: (a) in addition to cell death, a population of cells undergoes synaptic deafferentation and (b) light stimulation delays cell death and deafferentation. Among the three rearing conditions studied (6:18LD, 12:12LD, and 18:6LD), the 12:12LD condition appears to be the one achieving the optimal therapeutic effect.

4002,"SRS of brain AVM Brain AVM was one of the first pathologies treated with stereotactic radiosurgery, notably the Gammaknife. Almost all treatment and outcome models are thus derived from the abundance of data from Gammaknife treatment. Due to differences in radiation dose distribution these models may not be fully applicable to treatment with linear accelerator or proton beam generator. The results from SRS of brain AVMare predictable and depend on a few well defined parameters: The chance for obliteration depends on the radiation dose to the periphery of the AVM nidus. Typically a radiation dose of 25Gy will incure an 80% chance for obliteration over a three year period. The risk for adverse radiation effects (oedema, radionecrosis, cysts) depends on the amount of energy deposited into the target and the surrounding brain. Thus the higher the radiation dose and the bigger the target the higher the risk. The risk for hemorrhage during the latency period before occlusion (maximum of three years) depends on the radiation dose to the periphery of the nidus, the nidus volume, previous recent hemorrhage and probably AVM location. Thus the higher the radiation dose and the smaller the target - the lower the risk for hemorrhage. Previous recent hemorrhage and central AVM location increases the risk.",Excluded,0.09857363
4003,"Radiation dose in neuroangiography using image noise reduction technology: a population study based on 614 patients INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to quantify the reduction in patient radiation dose by X-ray imaging technology using image noise reduction and system settings for neuroangiography and to assess its impact on the working habits of the physician.METHODS: Radiation dose data from 190 neuroangiographies and 112 interventional neuroprocedures performed with state-of-the-art image processing and reference system settings were collected for the period January-June 2010. The system was then configured with extra image noise reduction algorithms and system settings, which enabled radiation dose reduction without loss of image quality. Radiation dose data from 174 neuroangiographies and 138 interventional neuroprocedures were collected for the period January-June 2012. Procedures were classified as diagnostic or interventional. Patient radiation exposure was quantified using cumulative dose area product and cumulative air kerma. Impact on working habits of the physician was quantified using fluoroscopy time and number of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images.RESULTS: The optimized system settings provided significant reduction in dose indicators versus reference system settings (p<0.001): from 124 to 47 Gy cm(2) and from 0.78 to 0.27 Gy for neuroangiography, and from 328 to 109 Gy cm(2) and from 2.71 to 0.89 Gy for interventional neuroradiology. Differences were not significant between the two systems with regard to fluoroscopy time or number of DSA images.CONCLUSION: X-ray imaging technology using an image noise reduction algorithm and system settings provided approximately 60% radiation dose reduction in neuroangiography and interventional neuroradiology, without affecting the working habits of the physician.",Excluded,0.08587879
4004,"Outcomes of spine stereotactic body radiation therapy in patients previously treated with conventional radiation Purpose/Objective(s): Spine stereotactic body radiation therapy (sSBRT) is used to treat relapse following conventional radiation (cEBRT). This study seeks to determine the risk factors for local relapse both radiographically and in regards to pain. Materials/Methods: Patients who underwent sSBRT following cEBRT were included in an IRB-approved database. RPA Class, histology, presence of paraspinal disease, multilevel disease (more than 1 spinal level involved), presence of epidural disease, neural foramina involvement, and dosimetric factors (volume, prescription dose, % coverage by the prescription dose, maximum dose, minimum dose) were retrospectively collected. These factors were correlated to radiographic control and pain progression as determined by the Brief Pain Inventory. Result(s): A total of 79 procedures were performed in 65 patients. Median age was 60 years (range: 27-90). Median follow-up was 8.5 months (range: 0-57.7) and median overall survival was 10.5 months. Median prescription dose was 14 Gy (range: 8-25) typically over 1 fraction (range: 1-10). At presentation, 10.1% were asymptomatic, 6.3% had neurological deficits, 72.2% had pain, and 11.4% had pain and neurological deficits. Following sSBRT, pain control was seen in 81% and 78.5% had radiographic control at last follow-up. Median time to pain relief was 0.7 months (range: 0-3.9). RPA Class, histology, presence of paraspinal disease, multilevel disease, presence of epidural disease, and neural foramina involvement did not predict for radiographic control or pain progression. None of the dosimetric factors predicted for radiographic control or pain progression as well. None of the patients in this series developed myelopathy. New vertebral body fracture developed in 8.9% of treatments. Conclusion(s): sSBRT for progression post cEBRT is effective and safe. Pain relief is quick following sSBRT. Our current standard dose is 16 Gy in 1 fraction. These results are consistent with our data for patients treated upfront for spine metastases. Previous cEBRT does not appear to compromise the effectiveness of sSBRT.",Excluded,0.09369767

[Japanese] The patient was a 55-year-old woman who was admitted because of palpitation. Laboratory data on admission showed a thyroidal hyper function, a marked increase in concentration of plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and mild cardiomegaly on chest rodiogram. We diagnosed this clinical situation as primary hyperthyroidism. Thyroid function returned to normal and the palpitation ceased 1 month after treatment with thiamazole. Plasma BNP concentration decreased but remained slightly high for 4 months and returned to the normal range 11 months after admission. M-mode echocardiogram showed normal contraction of the left ventricular wall throughout the clinical course, and mitral inflow velocity by pulsed Doppler method showed the E >A pattern on admission and an abnormal relaxation pattern 4 months after admission. Cyclic variation of integrated backscatter (IB) value in the left ventricular posterior wall was small at time of admission (3.6 dB), had increased 4 months later (7.7 dB), and was close to the normal range 11 months toper admission (8.7 dB).

4007,"Inter-individual variations in electric fields induced in the brain by exposure to uniform magnetic fields at 50 Hz The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard establish safety limits for human exposure to electromagnetic fields. At low frequencies, only a limited number of computational body models or simplified geometrical shapes are used to relate the internal induced electric fields and the external magnetic fields. As a consequence, both standard/guidelines derive the exposure reference levels for the external magnetic field without considering the variability between individuals. Here we provide quantitative data on the variation of the maximum electric field strengths induced in the brain of 118 individuals when exposed to uniform magnetic fields at 50 Hz. We found that individual characteristics, such as age and skull volume, as well as incident magnetic field direction, have a systematic effect on the peak electric field values. Older individuals show higher induced electric field strengths, possibly due to age-related anatomical changes in brain. Peak electric field strengths are found to increase for larger skull volumes, as well as for incident magnetic fields directed along the lateral direction. Moreover, the maximum electric fields provided by the anatomical models used by ICNIRP for deriving exposure limits are considerably higher than those obtained here. On the contrary, the IEEE elliptical exposure model produces a weaker peak electric field strength. Our findings are useful for the revision and harmonization of the current exposure standard and guidelines. The present investigation reduces the dosimetric uncertainty of the induced electric field among different anatomical induction models. The obtained results can be used as a basis for the selection of appropriate reduction factors when deriving exposure reference levels for human protection to low-frequency electromagnetic exposure.",Excluded,0.08616727
4008,"The effects of low-level laser irradiation on differentiation and proliferation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells into neurons and osteoblasts-an in vitro study Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are promising for use in regenerative medicine. Several studies have shown that low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) could affect the differentiation and proliferation of MSCs. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of LLLI at different energy densities on BMSCs differentiation into neuron and osteoblast. Human BMSCs were cultured and induced to differentiate to either neuron or osteoblast in the absence or presence of LLLI. Gallium aluminum arsenide (GaAlAs) laser irradiation (810 nm) was applied at days and of differentiation process at energy densities of 3 or 6 J/cm<sup>2</sup> for BMSCs being induced to neurons, and 2 or 4 J/cm<sup>2</sup> for BMSCs being induced to osteoblasts. BMSCs proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay on the seventh day of differentiation. BMSCs differentiation to neurons was assessed by immunocytochemical analysis of neuron-specific enolase on the seventh day of differentiation. BMSCs differentiation to osteoblastwas tested on the second, fifth, seventh and tenth day of differentiation via analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. LLLI promoted BMSCs proliferation significantly at all energy densities except for 6 J/cm<sup>2</sup> in comparison to control groups on the seventh day of differentiation. LLLI at energy densities of 3 and 6 J/cm<sup>2</sup> dramatically facilitated the differentiation of BMSCs into neurons (p<.001). Also, ALP activity was significantly enhanced in irradiated BMSCs differentiated to osteoblast on the second, fifth, seventh, and tenth day of differentiation (p<0.001 except for the second day). Using LLLI at 810 nm wavelength enhances BMSCs differentiation into neuron and osteoblast in the range of 2-6 J/cm <sup>2</sup>, and at the same time increases BMSCs proliferation (except for 6 J/cm<sup>2</sup>). The effect of LLLI on differentiation and proliferation of BMSCs is dose-dependent. Considering these findings, LLLI could improve current in vitro methods of differentiating BMSCs prior to transplantation. Â© 2011 Springer-Verlag London Ltd.",Excluded,0.08591376

Application of protons to a neuron causes a dosedependent decrease in the peak amplitude and acceleration of I<sub>Tau</sub> desensitization. Addition of 100 nM beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) to the perfusate caused acceleration of I<sub>Tau</sub> desensitization. The effects of Abeta and H<sup>+</sup> on the rate of I<sub>Tau</sub> desensitization were not additive. In addition, Abeta attenuated the effect of H<sup>+</sup> on the peak amplitude of I<sub>Tau</sub>.

Conebeam CT offers a much higher resolution of the interface between bone, air and soft tissue, while the associated irradiation dose is substantially lower, as compared to multi-detector CT scans. As such, CBCT has become very useful for the pre-op work-up of patients with cholesteatoma showing with precision bony erosion of the ossicular chain and erosion of the petrous bone (as fistulae, perilabyrinthine erosion, intracranial invasion). Also the aeration of theME-cleft is shown (important for the functional prognosis) and important preoperative landmarks warn the surgeon for eventual pitfalls. The advent of the non-EP diffusion weighted sequence in MR-imaging makes this sequence a very useful adjunctive tool in the pre-op work-up of cholesteatoma cases specially in cases suspected of intralabyrinthine spread, or extension medial to the otic capsule or intracranial invasion. Its today almost undisputed value has been demonstrated in the postoperative follow-up of cholesteatoma by the high sensitivity and specificity (in most studies well above 90%).

4014,"Possible involvement of hippocampal immediate-early genes in contextual fear memory deficit induced by cranial irradiation Cranial irradiation can trigger adverse effects on brain functions, including cognitive ability. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying radiation-induced cognitive impairments remain still unknown. Immediate-early genes (IEGs) are implicated in neuronal plasticity and the related functions (i.e., memory formation) in the hippocampus. The present study quantitatively assessed changes in the mRNA and protein levels of the learning-induced IEGs, including Arc, c-fos, and zif268, in the mouse hippocampus after cranial irradiation using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Mice (male, 8-week-old C57BL/6) received whole-brain irradiation with 0 or 10Gy of gamma-ray and, 2weeks later, contextual fear conditioning (CFC) was used to induce IEGs. In the CFC task, mice evaluated 2weeks after irradiation exhibited significant memory deficits compared with sham (0Gy)-irradiated controls. The levels of mRNA encoding IEGs were significantly upregulated in the hippocampus 10 and 30min after CFC training. The mRNA levels in the irradiated hippocampi were significantly lower than those in the sham-irradiated controls. The IEG protein levels were significantly increased in all hippocampal regions, including the hippocampal dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis (CA)1, and CA3, after CFC training. The CFC-induced upregulation of Arc and c-fos in 10Gy-irradiated hippocampi was significantly lower than that in sham-irradiated controls, although there were no significant differences in the protein levels of the learning-induced zif268 between sham-irradiated and 10Gy-irradiated hippocampi. Thus, cranial irradiation with 10Gy of gamma-ray impairs the induction of hippocampal IEGs (particularly Arc and c-fos) via behavioral contextual fear memory, and this disturbance may be associated with the memory deficits evident in mice after cranial irradiation, possibly through the dysregulation of neuronal plasticity during memory formation.",Included,0.9843083

Here, we investigated the cellular fate of poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles presenting different surface chemistries, after administration by convection-enhanced delivery. We demonstrate that nanoparticles with 'stealth' properties mostly avoid internalization by all cell types, but internalization can be enhanced by functionalization with bio-adhesive end-groups.

4019,"Prevalence and predictors of knee pain with neuropathic features in a community based cohort Purpose: The aetiopathology of pain in osteoarthritis (OA) is poorly understood and a combination of local nociceptive and more central neuropathic mechanisms is likely. This may be critical in helping to guide individualized patient care. Previous studies have shown that neuropathic pain, associated with significantly higher levels of mood disturbance, is present in over onequarter of older adults with chronic symptomatic radiographic knee OA. The study aims were to determine the prevalence and predictors of neuropathic pain using the painDetect questionnaire (PDQ) in a UK community-based cohort of women with knee pain. Method(s): Participants were selected from an established longitudinal population-based cohort, of 1003 women aged 43-65 years from a single general practice in the UK recruited in 1988-9. Those attending the year 20 follow-up visit with self-reported knee pain in the preceding month were included in this study. Participants self-completed the PDQ for each symptomatic knee reported. The PDQ assesses pain quality, pattern and radiation of pain resulting in a composite score (range -1 to 38) and, in patients with low back pain, the thresholds are 13-18 for possible neuropathic pain and >19 for likely neuropathic pain with 85% sensitivity, 80% specificity and 83% positive predictive value. Participants also completed: the hospital anxiety and depression score (HADS); the average knee pain severity over the preceding month was documented using a numeric rating scale of 0-10; pain in six other joints (shoulders, hips and hands); use of analgesia (paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids) and neuropathic medications (antidepressants and anticonvulsants). Age, height and weight were recorded and fully extended radiographs of the knees taken within 5 years were graded for structural features of OA using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) scoring system, with radiographic OA (ROA) defined as KL > 2. PDQ scores were log transformed and we used linear regression, with GEE to account for clustering of knees from the same participant, to identify factors associated with neuropathic pain adjusting for age, BMI and analgesia and neuropathic medication use. Result(s): Of 565 participants attending the year 20 follow-up visit, 146 participants reported knee pain in the preceding month, of which 42 complained of bilateral knee pain corresponding to a total of 188 (Table presented) symptomatic knees. Included participants had a higher BMI and number of other painful joints, were less likely to have ROA and more likely to use analgesia, compared to those without knee pain. HADS did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Only 10/188 (5.3%) and 2/188 (1.1%) knees fulfilled the standard criteria for possible and likely neuropathic pain respectively (Figure). However, few knees were painful without any neuropathic features 8/188 (4.3%). Univariate analysis demonstrated that both HADS and pain severity, but not ROA or number of painful joints, were significantly positively associated with PDQ score. These associations persisted inmultivariate analysiswhen adjusted for age, BMI and medication use. For each unit increase in HADS and pain severity, PDQ increased by 4% (1%-8%) and 10% (5%-15%) respectively (Table 1). Conclusion(s): Of those with self-reported knee pain from a communitybased cohort, few fulfilled the criteria for possible and likely neuropathic pain using the standard PDQ thresholds. However, neuropathic features were more common with both increasing severity of knee pain and also measures of anxiety and depression. Evaluation for features of neuropathic pain as well as mood should be considered in patients with knee pain and may represent an important therapeutic target.

The cells have been stimulated in vitro with different number of pulses (75 - 1250), different intensities (10, 20 and 40%) and different frequencies (0.25, 1 and 10 Hz) by using a double coil (2x70 mm) connected to the 'Magstim rapid'. At selected time points after treatment the following endpoints have been determined: viability, cyclic AMP (cAMP) and heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72) (HL-60 cells), and viability, cAMP, dopamine and noradrenaline (PC12 cells). Viability was measured with the alamarBlue assay, whereas cAMP, Hsp72, dopamine and noradrenaline were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).RESULTS: In both cell lines viability was not influenced by rTMS treatment, the same was true for the cytosolic cAMP concentration. In HL-60 cells rTMS treatment did not change the Hsp72 content, also a protective effect of rTMS treatment on cell viability before toxic H(2)O(2) treatment was not observed. After high potassium treatment the release of the two neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline in PC12 cells was enhanced 15- and 5-fold, respectively, but after rTMS treatment no change in the release of the two neurotransmitters was observed.CONCLUSIONS: In two mammalian cell lines rTMS treatment in a variety of exposure conditions does not influence any of the measured parameters.",Excluded,0.08624068

To clarify its role particularly in orienting behaviors, we studied cholinergic effects on the major output neuron group of the SGI, crossed tecto-reticular neurons (cTRNs), identified by retrograde labeling from the contralateral brain stem gaze center in SC slices obtained from rats (PND 17-22) by whole cell patch-clamp techniques. Bath application of carbachol induced either 1) nicotinic inward (nIN) + muscarinic inward (mIN) (11/24) or 2) nIN + mIN + muscarinic outward (mOUT) (13/24) current responses. Transient pressure application of 1 mM acetylcholine elicited nIN in all neurons tested (n = 58). In a majority of these neurons (52/58), the nIN was completely suppressed by dihydro-beta-erythroidine, a specific antagonist for alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor subtype. The remaining 6/58 neurons exhibited not only the slower alpha4beta2 receptor-mediated component but also a faster component that was inhibited by a specific antagonist for alpha7 nicotinic receptor, alpha-bungarotoxin. cTRNs expressing alpha7 nicotinic receptors tended to be smaller in size than those lacking alpha7 receptors. Bath application of muscarine induced two response patterns: mIN only (17/38) and mIN+ mOUT (21/38). The mIN and mOUT were mediated by M3 (plus M1) and M2 muscarinic receptors, respectively. These results suggest that a major response to cholinergic inputs to cTRNs is excitatory.

4024,"Efficacy in vivo of a cancer therapy strategy combining HSV1716 mediated oncolysis with gene transfer and targeted radiotherapy Oncolytic herpes viruses have show promise for the treatment of cancer however it is unlikely that the optimal application of these viruses will be as single therapeutic agents. An alternative strategy would be to utilise these viruses to deliver therapeutic transgenes and enhance their tumour cell killing capacity. The herpes simplex virus-1 deletion mutant HSV1716 is a conditionally- replicating oncolytic virus. The safety of HSV1716 has been demonstrated in phase 1 clinical trails with no toxicity attributable to the virus in any patients and provided proof of principle that the virus is capable of directly destroying human tumour cells while leaving normal cells intact (1). To enhance its therapeutic potential, we have engineered HSV1716 to convey the noradrenaline transporter gene (NAT) and thus rendered transfected cells targetable with the radiopharmaceutical [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG. [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG is currently used in the treatment of NAT-expressing neuroblastoma, phaeochromocytoma and carcinoids. In this study we have utilised the recombinant virus HSV1716/NAT as a dual cell lysis / gene delivery vehicle for targeting of the NAT transgene to human tumour xenografts in vivo. We have shown that intra-tumoural or intra-venous injection of HSV1716/NAT induced the capacity for active uptake of intra-peritoneal administered [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG in human glioma, melanoma and colorectal tumour xenograft models which do not express NAT. Tumour growth was significantly delayed after administration of HSV1716/NAT and [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG compared to treatment with either agents alone. However, the efficacy of combination treatment was dependent on the scheduling of delivery of the two agents. These findings support a role for combination radio-/gene therapy for cancer utilising HSV1716 expressing the NAT transgene and targeted radionuclide therapy.",Excluded,0.085637875
4025,"1MBq/kg may be sufficient for brain F18-FDG PET in integrated PET/MR system Objectives: Integrated PET/MR offers multiple advantages for brain examinations, regards to superior soft-tissue contrast of MRI compared to CT, but also because of the substantial reduction in patient ionizing radiation exposure due to the absence of CT scan. 2 MBq/kg of 18F-FDG are usually administered for brain PET/CT in clinical settings. Taking into account the high sensitivity of PET/MR systems with time-of-flight capability and, considering that a 20-30 min MR acquisition time is usually mandatory in neurological indications, we assume that the administered dose could be significantly decreased in brain PET/MR examination without degrading qualitative and quantitative characteristics of 18F-FDG PET images. Method(s): A retrospective single-institution study was performed on 100 patients (mean age 66.9 +/- 10.5 years, 51 men, 49 females) explored for cognitive impairment or suspicion of neurodegenerative disease, between March 2016 and May 2016. Simultaneous brain 18F-FDG-PET/MR was acquired with the SIGNA PET/MR system (GE Healthcare) for 30 min, 30-60 min after tracer injection (18F-FDG, 2MBq/kg), including a 20 min single-bed-position PET emission scan. In each patient, list-mode acquisition was reconstructed to generate two sets of PET images: a 20-minute summation image used in clinical routine (PET<inf>20min</inf>), and a ten-minute summation image (PET<inf>10min</inf>) to simulate a low-dose injection by reducing the amount of collected data. Two independent nuclear physicians were asked to classify brain metabolic pattern into 6 diagnostic classes: Alzheimer's disease (AD), logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA), semantic dementia (SD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), normal or non-evaluable (NE). The first set of 100 images (PET<inf>20min</inf>) was analyzed once and, the second one (PET<inf>10min</inf>) 2-3 months later. Regional SUV ratios were extracted with CortexID Suite (GE Healthcare) from PET<inf>20min</inf> (SUV<inf>20min</inf>) and PET<inf>10min</inf> (SUV<inf>10min</inf>) images and compared pairwise. Intraclass correlation coefficient was measured. Bland-Altman graphical analyses were also conducted. Result(s): Brain metabolism was suggestive of AD in 37% patients, LPA (3%), SD (12%), FTD (10%). It was classified as normal in 37% and NE in only one case. Very good agreement (kappa=0.951) was found between PET<inf>20min</inf> and PET<inf>10min</inf> visual assessments for both readers. Regional SUV<inf>20min</inf> and SUV<inf>10min</inf> were strongly correlated (r = 0.988). Differences between SUV<inf>20min</inf> and SUV<inf>10min</inf> ranged from-0.19 to 0.14 (median-0.01; 95% limits of agreement:-0.08 to 0.08). Such differences were too mild to modify the interpretation of brain PET metabolism in clinical settings. Conclusion(s): 50% dose reduction of 18F-FDG could be performed for brain PET/MR imaging without modifying diagnostic performances and PET/MR examination duration. A dose of 1 MBq/kg of 18F-FDG may be sufficient for rEliable measurements of regional SUV ratios in brain PET. The low-dose protocol will lead to a major reduction in patient ionizing radiation exposure (effective dose: 1.42 mSv for a 75kg subject) and could be useful in research studies requiring serial PET in healthy controls.",Excluded,0.08650833

4029,"Rapid enzymatic response to compensate UV radiation in copepods Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) causes physical damage to DNA, carboxylation of proteins and peroxidation of lipids in copepod crustaceans, ubiquitous and abundant secondary producers in most aquatic ecosystems. Copepod adaptations for long duration exposures include changes in behaviour, changes in pigmentation and ultimately changes in morphology. Adaptations to short-term exposures are little studied. Here we show that short-duration exposure to UVR causes the freshwater calanoid copepod, Eudiaptomus gracilis, to rapidly activate production of enzymes that prevent widespread collateral peroxidation (glutathione S-transferase, GST), that regulate apoptosis cell death (Caspase-3, Casp-3), and that facilitate neurotransmissions (cholinesterase-ChE). None of these enzyme systems is alone sufficient, but they act in concert to reduce the stress level of the organism. The interplay among enzymatic responses provides useful information on how organisms respond to environmental stressors acting on short time scales. Â© 2012 Souza et al.",Excluded,0.08639359

Data from 86 centers across the world were analyzed. All CT interactions were automatically collected and transmitted to the CT vendor during two 6-week periods immediately before and 2 weeks after implementation of ATVS. A total of 164 323 unique CT studies were analyzed. Studies were categorized by body region and type of examination. Tube voltage and volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) were compared between examinations performed with ATVS and those performed before ATVS implementation. Descriptive statistical methods and multilevel linear regression models were used for analysis.RESULTS: Across all types of CT examinations and body regions, CTDIvol was 14.7% lower in examinations performed with ATVS (n = 30 313) than in those performed before ATVS implementation (n = 79 275). Relative reductions in mean CTDIvol were most notable for temporal bone CT (-56.1%), peripheral runoff CT angiography (-48.6%), CT of the paranasal sinus (-39.6%), cerebral or carotid CT angiography (-36.4%), coronary CT angiography (-25.1%), and head CT (-23.9%). An increase in mean CTDIvol was observed for renal stone protocols (26.2%) and thoracic or lumbar spine examinations (6.6%). In the multilevel model with fixed effects ATVS and examination type, and the interaction of these variables and the random effect country, a significant influence on CTDIvol for all fixed efects was revealed (ATVS, P = .0031; examination type, P < .0001; interaction term, P < .0001).CONCLUSION: ATVS significantly reduces radiation dose across most, but not all, body regions and types of CT examinations.",Excluded,0.08673458
4031,"""Soundmorphing"": a new approach to studying speech perception in humans A problem in current studies of brain activation in speech perception is that most studies use stimuli that are sampled from different categories. This study presents a new approach in creating acoustic stimuli by filtering real words in different ways, thus this enables one to 'morph' the sounds gradually from something like tones to real words while preserving temporal characteristics (""soundmorphing""). This will make it possible to explore steps between tone and speech processing on a gradual scale. This study aimed to investigate more closely the network, involved in the perception of speech and the decoding of auditory (speech-)stimuli. Sets of auditory stimuli were created by dividing real words into several frequency-bands and creating a randomised rearrangement of these components. Four different sets of stimuli were used, containing 1, 2, 3 or 4 frequency bands (total range: 0-2500 Hz). Only the latter one contained intelligible words. During the fMRI session, these four trial types were presented pseudo-randomised. In all conditions, significant activations of auditory cortex were observed. The number of activated voxels and their significance increased over the four trial types. In addition, Broca's area, SMA, left thalamus, and right cerebellum were activated in the most complex and most speech-like condition. Comparing these complexes with the tone-like trials, only the left auditory cortex, left SMA, and cingulate gyrus became significant. These activations reflect the bilateral processing of the auditory stimuli, but only the left temporal areas demonstrated an increasing BOLD response with an increasing number of presented frequency components.",Excluded,0.08580777

Feasibility, safety and radiation exposure considerations BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose was to investigate our centre's experience on computed-tomography-guided (CT-guided), transforaminal, intrathecal administration of nusinersen in adult subjects with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 2 and severe spinal deformity.METHOD: This is a retrospective, single-centre study investigating the feasibility and safety of CT-guided, transforaminal, lumbar puncture for the intrathecal administration of nusinersen (Spinranza R; Biogen; Cambridge, MA, USA) in a cohort of adult subjects with SMA type 2, severe neuromuscular scoliosis and previous spinal surgery. Between January 2019 and October 2019, five male, adult, SMA type 2 subjects were eligible to be treated in our centre with nusinersen. The mean age of the patients was 31 +/- 9 years (range 19-43 years). The study's outcome measures were technical success, adverse events and radiation exposure.RESULTS: In total, four patients completed the four loading doses, whilst the fifth patient received only one loading dose; two patients also received their first maintenance doses. Overall, 20 consecutive transforaminal, intrathecal treatments were analysed. Technical success was 100% (20/20 intrathecal infusions). No adverse events were documented following the procedures. Mean dose-length product (DLP) value per injection was 665.4 +/- 715.5 mGy*cm. Estimated mean effective dose per injection was 12.7 +/- 12.9 mSv. Subgroup analysis between the chronologically first 10 versus subsequent 10 procedures demonstrated a clear trend towards less radiation exposure in the latter, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (DLP: 984.7 +/- 903.3 vs. 436.7 +/- 321.5 mGy*cm, P = 0.165; respectively).CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective series, CT-guided transforaminal access for intrathecal injection of nusinersen was proven feasible and safe.

4035,"Monocarboxylate transporter-4 depletion inhibits stemness, promotes DNA damage and radiosensitizes glioblastoma stem cells Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumor in adults, with a median survival for patients of 12-15 months after diagnosis. Standard therapy includes radiation and chemotherapy, with GBM recurrences refractory to second line treatments. Given the lack of therapeutic opportunities in GBM, new treatment strategies are urgently needed. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) have been shown to support GBM maintenance and exhibit enhanced resistance to ionizing radiation, a cornerstone of GBM therapy. Monocarboxylate transporter-4 (MCT4, SLC16A3) is highly expressed in the vast majority of GBMs and predominantly in cells that congregate in ""palisades"" around centers of necrosis or in cells where hypoxiainducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is expressed either due to reduced oxygen levels or other microenvironmental stresses. MCT4 appears to regulate proliferation, survival, and xenograft implantation of GSC neurosphere lines. Importantly, we found these effects to be independent of lactate homeostasis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of differentially expressed genes revealed an enrichment of DNA replication stress response pathways including cell cycle (G2/M checkpoint), DNA replication, DNA damage response (DDR), and cellular deoxyribonucleotide metabolism in MCT4-depleted GSCs. To validate these data, after lentiviral silencing of MCT4 expression in two GBM neurosphere lines, we examined DNA repair potential by assessing the resolution of yH2AX and by performing alkaline comet assays. In both assays, reduced MCT4 levels resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of nuclear foci (p < 0.0001) and in the percentage of cells with comet tails (p=0.0003), respectively, confirming that reduced MCT4 expression decreases cellular ability to repair DNA damage. Moreover, we show that conditional MCT4 depletion alone (p=0.0001) or in combination with ionizing radiation (p=0.0006) efficiently enhance survival of mice orthotopi- cally implanted with GSC-derived xenografts. We determined that MCT4 inhibition enhances the radiosensitivity of GBM and should be explored as a treatment strategy to complement conventional treatment.",Excluded,0.085989065

A recommended diagnostic workup Background: Patients admitted for suspicion of shunt dysfunction (SD) often show unspecific symptoms and require time-consuming, expensive and even invasive diagnostics involving significant radiation exposure. The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the current diagnostic procedures and to propose a process optimisation. Method(s): As all patients admitted for suspicion of SD receive imaging studies, we searched for adult patients receiving neuroimaging in the period from January 2010 to July 2013, analysing referring diagnosis, clinical signs, products, diagnostic process and final diagnosis. Recursive partitioning was used to define time intervals for differentiating types of SD. Result(s): A total of 148 patients, aged 18-89 (mean, 54) years, were studied. Forty-two percent were referred by a hospital or rehabilitation centre, 30% by general practitioners and 24% were self-referrals. The admission diagnosis was in the majority ""shunt dysfunction"" only. Further differentiations were rarely made. An SD was confirmed in 46% of the patients. In 17%, the symptoms were based on another cause and in 37% they could not be clearly attributed to any specific disorder. Abdominal dislocations (2%) and shunt infections (5%) were found within the first 6 months. Over- (3%) and under-drainage (14%) were the most frequent complications during the first 4 years. Disconnections (13%) occurred generally 4 years or more after implantation. Only shunt obstruction (9%) showed no temporal pattern. Conclusion(s): Symptoms of SD remain mostly unspecific.

4038,"Atm knock-in mice harboring an in-frame deletion corresponding to the human ATM 7636del9 common mutation exhibit a variant phenotype ATM, the gene mutated in the human immunodeficiency disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), plays a central role in recognizing ionizing radiation damage in DNA and in controlling several cell cycle checkpoints. We describe here a murine model in which a nine-nucleotide in-frame deletion has been introduced into the Atm gene by homologous recombination followed by removal of the selectable marker cassette by Cre-loxP site-specific, recombination-mediated excision. This mouse, Atm-DeltaSRI, was designed as a model of one of the most common deletion mutations (7636del9) found in A-T patients. The murine Atm deletion results in the loss of three amino acid residues (SRI; 2556-2558) but produces near full-length detectable Atm protein that lacks protein kinase activity. Radiosensitivity was observed in Atm-DeltaSRI mice, whereas the immunological profile of these mice showed greater heterogeneity of T-cell subsets than observed in Atm(-/-) mice. The life span of Atm-DeltaSRI mice was significantly longer than that of Atm(-/-) mice when maintained under nonspecific pathogen-free conditions. This can be accounted for by a lower incidence of thymic lymphomas in Atm-DeltaSRI mice up to 40 weeks, after which time the animals died of other causes. The thymic lymphomas in Atm-DeltaSRI mice were characterized by extensive apoptosis, which appears to be attributable to an increased number of cells expressing Fas ligand. A variety of other tumors including B-cell lymphomas, sarcomas, and carcinomas not seen in Atm(-/-) mice were observed in older Atm-DeltaSRI animals. Thus, expression of mutant protein in Atm-DeltaSRI knock-in mice gives rise to a discernibly different phenotype to Atm(-/-) mice, which may account for the heterogeneity seen in A-T patients with different mutations.",Excluded,0.087183155

In recent years, it was found that a Y-90 PET scan can be acquired to determine the distribution of microspheres after their administration. While the obvious advantage of PET is better resolution than Bremsstrahlung imaging, the other great advantage of quantitative assessment is just beginning to be exploited. Method(s): In this retrospective study, 57 patients with HCC, which included 101 distinct tumors, were analyzed after Y-90 microsphere treatment in order to evaluate the dose of radiation delivered to liver tumors as well as to normal liver tissue. Using Y-90 PET/CT and triphasic liver CT scans in conjunction with commercially available imaging software, we were able to contour tumor and normal liver regions treated by Y-90 radioembolization and determine the specific activities (Bq/mL) for treated tumor and normal liver tissue. An absorbed dose factor, taking into account isotope branching ratios and decay was calculated through a phantom experiment. This factor was used to convert the specific activities (Bq/mL) of normal and malignant liver tissue to an absorbed dose (Gy). Result(s): The analysis suggests that the mean dose received among the 101 studied tumors was 166.45 Gy with a mode of 90-120 Gy and a treatment dose range of 0-570 Gy. Normal liver tissue in the 57 cases evaluated received a mean dose of 66.25 Gy with a mode of 60-70 Gy and a range of 10-120 Gy. Conclusion(s): This data demonstrates that the Y-90 dose to liver tumors after radioembolization is fairly similar to the brachytherapy dose used to treat other cancers. This also shows that the normal liver tissue may receive a dose which is nontrivial and have some real biological effects for the patient. This study is among the first to systematically showa method for quantitative dose assessment using Y-90 PET. These methods in the future can provide the tools to help understand whether patient adverse events, treatment success, or treatment failure can be attributed to the dose which the tumor or normal liver received.",Excluded,0.08556286
4042,"Fast acquisition cone-beam computed tomography: Initial experience with a 10 s protocol Background Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) facilitates the acquisition of cross-sectional imaging in angiography suites using a rotational C-arm and digital flat panel detectors. The applications are numerous, including evaluation of implanted devices and localization of cerebrovascular lesions. We present and validate the clinical utility of an alternative fast CBCT acquisition protocol in the context of neurovascular device imaging. Methods Contrast-enhanced (CE)-CBCT images were acquired using a new 10 s protocol in a phantom head model, swine model, and in patients. The acquisition parameters of both the 10 s and 20 s protocols were exactly the same, except for fewer projections (250 projections in 10 s vs 500 projections in 20 s), resulting in reduced scan time. Image quality was measured quantitatively in a controlled phantom study and qualitatively by blinded reviewers. The latter was performed to assess the image quality of the 10 s protocol pertinent to the device visibility and its apposition to the parent artery. Results 10 s CBCT images were comparable to 20 s CBCT in both phantom and animal studies. Of the 25 patient images, the reviewers agreed that they were able to discern the flow diverter struts and assess the apposition in all images. The overall rating for all 10 s images was 4.28 on a 5-point scale. No images were rated as less than 3, which was the average diagnostic quality. The ratings were concordant across three blinded reviewers (kappa =0.411). Additionally, contrast and spatial resolution between 10 s and 20 s images were similar in non-human models. Conclusions CBCT images of neurovascular devices can be obtained successfully using a 10 s acquisition protocol. In addition, the 10 s protocol offers faster acquisition, thus allowing its use in awake patients and with an added advantage of lower radiation and contrast dose.

4043,"Ganglion cells loss in non-optic neuritis eyes of MS patients Objective: Loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in non-optic neuritis (non-ON) eyes of MS patients has recently been reported. Several factors such as anterograde degeneration initiated by abnormalities in the outer retinal layer (ORL) or inner nuclear layer (INL), or primary degeneration of RGCs themselves may contribute to this process. Alternatively, RGC loss can result from retrograde degeneration caused by sub-clinical inflammation proximal to the RGC body. In the case of optic radiation lesions such neurodegeneration would require trans-synaptic transmission. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to look for evidence of sub-clinical inflammation along the visual pathway and/or structural and functional changes in outer retina to investigate their role in RGC loss in NON-ON eyes of MS patients. Method(s): Forty NON-ON eyes of 40 RRMS patients and thirty controls were included. The thickness of the retinal layers was measured by OCT (Spectralis, Heidelberg) and analysed using custom design segmentation software. RGCs were assessed using thickness of the Ganglion Cell Complex (GCC). Structural and functional integrity of outer retina was analysed using thickness of INL and ORL and full-field electroretinogram (ERG), while multifocal visual evoked potentials (mfVEP) were performed to assess evidence of sub-clinical inflammation along the visual pathway. Result(s): The thickness of GCC was significantly reduced in non-ON eyes (80.4+/-7.9mu vs 87.0+/-5.5mu, p=0.0003). No significant change in INL or ORL was detected (p=0.2 and 0.06). There was also no significant change in any of the ERG parameters. The latency of mfVEP, however, was significantly delayed (p=0.00001). GCC thickness correlated significantly with latency delay of the mfVEP (r2 =0.34, p<0.001), but not with thickness of outer retina layers or any ERG parameters. There was no significant thinning of GCC (84.0+/-3.6mu, p=0.08) in patients with normal (<99th percentile) mfVEP latency (17 patients). However in patients with a delayed latency (>99th percentile, 23 patients) GCC reduction become even more apparent (78.0+/-8.9mu, p=0.00005). Conclusion(s): Our results demonstrate a significant association of RGC loss with mfVEP latency delay, indicating that sub-clinical inflammation along the visual pathway contributes significantly to neuronal damage.

4045,"Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibition delays recurrence of glioblastoma after radiation by altering myeloid cell recruitment and polarization BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) may initially respond to treatment with ionizing radiation (IR), but the prognosis remains extremely poor because the tumors invariably recur. Using animal models, we previously showed that inhibiting stromal cell-derived factor 1 signaling can prevent or delay GBM recurrence by blocking IR-induced recruitment of myeloid cells, specifically monocytes that give rise to tumor-associated macrophages. The present study was aimed at determining if inhibiting colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) signaling could be used as an alternative strategy to target pro-tumorigenic myeloid cells recruited to irradiated GBM.METHODS: To inhibit CSF-1 signaling in myeloid cells, we used PLX3397, a small molecule that potently inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R). Combined IR and PLX3397 therapy was compared with IR alone using 2 different human GBM intracranial xenograft models.RESULTS: GBM xenografts treated with IR upregulated CSF-1R ligand expression and increased the number of CD11b+ myeloid-derived cells in the tumors. Treatment with PLX3397 both depleted CD11b+ cells and potentiated the response of the intracranial tumors to IR. Median survival was significantly longer for mice receiving combined therapy versus IR alone. Analysis of myeloid cell differentiation markers indicated that CSF-1R inhibition prevented IR-recruited monocyte cells from differentiating into immunosuppressive, pro-angiogenic tumor-associated macrophages.CONCLUSION: CSF-1R inhibition may be a promising strategy to improve GBM response to radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.12544498
4046,"Imaging the effects of rTMS-induced cortical plasticity Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) paradigms are showing increasing promise as tools for neurorehabilitation in a variety of chronic neurological and psychiatric conditions. However, the mechanisms by which they modulate cortical activation are still not completely understood. In this review we summarize what non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging techniques can tell us about the cortical effects of rTMS - from changes at a cellular level within the stimulated motor cortex, to modulating activation patterns within the wider motor network. We discuss how variation in these effects in stroke patients may inform our understanding of how rTMS could improve function in these patients.",Excluded,0.08592292
4047,"BOLD fMRI integration into radiosurgery treatment planning of cerebral vascular malformations Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to distinguish areas of the brain responsible for different tasks and functions. It is possible, for example, by using fMRI images, to identify particular regions in the brain which can be considered as ""functional organs at risk"" (fOARs), i.e., regions which would cause significant patient morbidity if compromised. The aim of this study is to propose and validate a method to exploit functional information for the identification of fOARs in CyberKnife (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) radiosurgery treatment planning; in particular, given the high spatial accuracy offered by the CyberKnife system, local nonrigid registration is used to reach accurate image matching. Five patients affected by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and scheduled to undergo radiosurgery were scanned prior to treatment using computed tomography (CT), three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography (3DRA), T2 weighted and blood oxygenation level dependent echo planar imaging MRI. Tasks were chosen on the basis of lesion location by considering those areas which could be potentially close to treatment targets. Functional data were superimposed on 3DRA and CT used for treatment planning. The procedure for the localization of fMRI areas was validated by direct cortical stimulation on 38 AVM and tumor patients undergoing conventional surgery. Treatment plans studied with and without considering fOARs were significantly different, in particular with respect to both maximum dose and dose volume histograms; consideration of the fOARs allowed quality indices of treatment plans to remain almost constant or to improve in four out of five cases compared to plans with no consideration of fOARs. In conclusion, the presented method provides an accurate tool for the integration of functional information into AVM radiosurgery, which might help to minimize undesirable side effects and to make radiosurgery less invasive.

4048,"Antioxidative and antiapoptotic genes expression in irradiated leukemia cells upon fullerenol nanoparticle treatment Recent data established the prospective applications for fullerenol (C<inf>60</inf>(OH)<inf>24</inf>) nanoparticle (FNP) in many fields, such as antioxidants, neuroprotective agents, and potential anti-radiation drugs. Leukemia cell sensitization to apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation is achieved by upregulation of ROS production and/or downregulation of antioxidative enzymes. Therefore, our aim was to analyze the potential role of fullerenol nanoparticle in modulation of the leukemic cellular response to irradiation. We used the qRT-PCR to analyze the expression level of mRNA for 11 genes in irradiated (IR) and FNP pre-treated irradiated cells (FNP + IR) K562 cells, and compared gene expression level with the overall cell survival, determined by DET and MTT assays. Interesting result of similar percentage of cell survival in FNP and FNP + IR groups (67.9% versus 63%), indicated the possible protective effect of FNP in irradiated cells. Under oxidative stress induced by radiation, cytoprotective genes such as GSTA4, MnSOD, NOS, CAT and HO-1 were upregulated in FNP pretreated K562 cells in comparison with control group, IR and FNP - treated non-irradiated cells. Amongst the antioxidative enzymes, only the mRNA of Cu, Zn - SOD (SOD-1) was downregulated, while gGT, GPX and GSTP1 were not significantly modulated in FNP-treated irradiated cells. Together with survival data and significant overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL genes, our results may indicate that FNP exerts cytoprotective function in K562 leukemic cells, rendering K562 cells more tolerant to radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.12396482
4049,"Gamma Knife surgery for patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas: Predictors of tumor control, neurological deficits, and hypopituitarism - Clinical article Object. Nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas often recur after microsurgery and thereby require further treatment. Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) has been used to treat recurrent adenomas. In this study, the authors evaluated outcomes following GKS of nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas and assessed predictors of tumor control, neurological deficits, and delayed hypopituitarism. Methods. Between June 1989 and March 2010, 140 consecutive patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas were treated using GKS at the University of Virginia. The median patient age was 51 years (range 21-82 years), and 56% of patients were male. Mean tumor volume was 5.6 cm3 (range 0.6-35 cm3). Thirteen patients were treated with GKS as primary therapy, and 127 had undergone at least 1 open resection prior to GKS. Ninety-three patients had a history of hormone therapy prior to GKS. The mean maximal dose of GKS was 38.6 Gy (range 10-70 Gy), the mean marginal dose was 18 Gy (range 5-25 Gy), and the mean number of isocenters was 9.8 (range 1-26). Follow-up evaluations were performed in all 140 patients, ranging from 0.5 to 17 years (mean 5 years, median 4.2 years). Results. Tumor volume remained stable or decreased in 113 (90%) of 125 patients with available follow-up imaging. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated radiographic progression free survival at 2, 5, 8, and 10 years to be 98%, 97%, 91%, and 87%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, a tumor volume greater than 5 cm3 (hazard ratio = 5.0, 95% CI 1.5-17.2; p = 0.023) was the only factor predictive of tumor growth. The median time to tumor progression was 14.5 years. Delayed hypopituitarism occurred in 30.3% of patients. No factor was predictive of post-GKS hypopituitarism. A new or worsening cranial nerve deficit occurred in 16 (13.7%) of 117 patients. Visual decline was the most common neurological deficit (12.8%), and all patients experiencing visual decline had evidence of tumor progression. In multivariate analysis, a tumor volume greater than 5 cm3 (OR = 3.7, 95% CI 1.2-11.7; p = 0.025) and pre-GKS hypopituitarism (OR = 7.5, 95% CI 1.1-60.8; p = 0.05) were predictive of a new or worsened neurological deficit. Conclusions. In patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas, GKS confers a high rate of tumor control and a low rate of neurological deficits. The most common complication following GKS is delayed hypopituitarism, and this occurs in a minority of patients.",Excluded,0.09378804
4050,"Local diagnostic reference levels and size-specific patient dose in computed tomography at a Greek Hospital Purpose: Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRLs) are a useful tool for patient dose optimization, however, they do not consider patient size as the concept of the sizespecific dose estimate (SSDE) introduced by AAPM. The aim of this study is to extract local DRLs for computed tomography (CT) exams at a Greek University Hospital in terms of volumetric CT Dose Index (CTDIvol) and dose-length product (DLP), as well as to evaluate the impact of patient size in patients' dose through SSDE. Method(s): The retrospective data from a total of 164 CT studies of Abdomen-Pelvis (A-P), Brain, Chest-Abdomen-Pelvis (C-A-P), Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) and Heart were extracted from a 16-slice and a 64-slice CT scanner and were utilized to extract DLP and CTDI values. This study estimated the effective dose (ED) from DLP measurements using the appropriate k-factors. SSDE was calculated from the product of CTDIvol with the appropriate conversion factor, based on the sum of the lateral and anteroposterior diameters. Results are compared with international DRL data. Result(s): Compared to national DRLs, the local DRLs regarding the CTDIvol values were lower by 14% for Abdomen-Pelvis, 43% for Brain and 25% for Chest-Abdomen-Pelvis exams. For CTPA and heart exams national DRLs were not suggested. In comparison to international DRLs, the picture of our results is mixed, having both higher and lower DRLs than other countries. However, for the CTPA exams, the local DRLs were higher by a range of 13%-30%. SSDE mean values were higher than CTDIvol mean values by a range of 19%- 24%, nonetheless for the brain exams their mean values were the same. Conclusion(s): The metrics of CTDIvol, DLP and ED were useful to evaluate our institution's radiology practice regarding the radiation exposure. Since SSDE is a more accurate patient dose indicator, it would be advantageous to be established as a DRL.",Excluded,0.08606577

APBI was delivered using 3-dimensional CRT (n = 29) or with SAVI (n = 176), Contura (n = 56), or MammoSite (n = 20) brachytherapy catheters. Patients were evaluated at protocol-specified intervals, at which time the radiation oncologist scored cosmetic outcome, toxicities, and recurrence status using a standardized template.RESULTS: The median follow-up time is 41 months. Grade 1 seroma and fibrosis were more common with brachytherapy than with 3-dimensional CRT (50.4% vs 3.4% for seroma; P < .0001 and 66.3% vs 44.8% for fibrosis; P = .02), but grade 1 edema was more common with 3-dimensional CRT than with brachytherapy (17.2% vs 5.6%; P = .04). Grade 2 to 3 pain was more common with 3-dimensional CRT (17.2% vs 5.2%; P = .03). Actuarial 5-year rates of fair or poor radiation oncologist-reported cosmetic outcome were 9% for 3-dimensional CRT and 24% for brachytherapy (P = .13). Brachytherapy was significantly associated with inferior cosmesis on mixed model analysis (P = .003). Significant predictors of reduced risk of adverse cosmetic outcome after brachytherapy were D0.1cc (skin) <=102%, minimum skin distance >5.1 mm, dose homogeneity index >0.54, and volume of nonconformance <=0.89 cc. The 5-year ipsilateral breast recurrence was 4.3% for brachytherapy and 4.2% for 3-dimensional CRT APBI patients (P = .95).CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy APBI is associated with higher rates of grade 1 fibrosis and seroma than 3-dimensional CRT but lower rates of grade 1 edema and grade 2 to 3 pain than 3-dimensional CRT. Rates of radiation oncologist-reported fair or poor cosmetic outcomes are higher with brachytherapy. We identified dosimetric parameters that predict reduced risk of adverse cosmetic outcome after brachytherapy-based APBI.

4054,"Therapeutic resistance in breast cancer cells can result from deregulated EGFR signaling The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) interacts with various downstream molecules including phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC), Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/Akt/GSK-3, Jak/STAT and others. Often these pathways are deregulated in human malignancies such as breast cancer. Various therapeutic approaches to inhibit the activity of EGFR family members including small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) have been developed. A common problem with cancer treatments is the development of drug-resistance. We examined the effects of a conditionally-activated EGFR (v-Erb-B:ER) on the resistance of breast cancer cells to commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, paclitaxel, cisplatin and 5-flurouracil as well as ionizing radiation (IR). v-Erb-B is similar to the EGFR-variant EGFRvIII, which is expressed in various cancers including breast, brain, prostate. Both v-Erb-B and EGFRvIII encode the EGFR kinase domain but lack key components present in the extracellular domain of EGFR which normally regulate its activity and ligand-dependence. The v-Erb-B oncogene was ligated to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER) which results in regulation of the activity of the v-Erb-ER construct by addition of either estrogen (E2) or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) to the culture media. Introduction of the v-Erb-B:ER construct into the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line increased the resistance to the cells to various chemotherapeutic drugs, hormonal-based therapeutics and IR. These results point to the important effects that aberrant expression of EGFR kinase domain can have on therapeutic resistance.",Excluded,0.086023666
4055,"Modulations of nerve growth factor and Bcl-2 in ultraviolet-irradiated human epidermis BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation to the skin causes apoptosis of keratinocytes. Melanocytes are more resistant to UV-induced apoptosis, due, in part, to high levels of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2. In vitro studies have shown that nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophic polypeptide, is produced by keratinocytes and exerts a protective role for melanocytes by upregulating Bcl-2. The purpose of this study was to determine NGF and Bcl-2 modulations in UV-irradiated human skin.METHODS: Nine volunteers were irradiated with two minimal erythema doses using solar-simulated UV irradiation. Seventy-two hours post irradiation, skin biopsies were obtained from irradiated and sun-protected skin. The skin specimens were stained with anti-tyrosinase-related protein-1 monoclonal antibody IgG2a (Mel-5), anti-Bcl-2 (monoclonal antibody IgG-kappa), and with anti-NGF (polyclonal antibody IgG).RESULTS: NGF staining was identified within the cytoplasm of epidermal melanocytes, similar to the staining observed for TRP-1 and Bcl-2. While no significant difference in the number of TRP-1- and Bcl-2-positive melanocytes was observed between irradiated and non-irradiated skin within 72 h, the number of NGF-positive melanocytes decreased significantly, 72 h after UV irradiation (p < 0.024). NGF was also identified within keratinocytes, and while non-irradiated skin exhibited cytoplasmic NGF staining throughout the epidermis, NGF staining was reduced in the lower epidermal layers after UV irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first in vivo study showing NGF to be present in melanocytes, as well as showing modulations of NGF and Bcl-2 in melanocytes, following solar-simulated UV irradiation.",Excluded,0.08788578

In a double-blind task design, subjects were exposed to either genuine or sham irradiation in two separate sessions. Before and after irradiation subjects were presented with a random series of 50 ms tone burst (frequent standards: 1 kHz, P=0.8, rare deviants: 1.5 kHz, P=0.2) at a mean repetition rate of 1500 ms while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The subjects' task was to silently count the appearance of targets. The amplitude and latency of the N100, N200, P200 and P300 components for targets and standards were analyzed in 29 subjects. We found no significant effects of electromagnetic field (EMF) irradiation on the amplitude and latency of the above ERP components. In order to study possible effects of EMF on attentional processes, we applied a wavelet-based time-frequency method to analyze the early gamma component of brain responses to auditory stimuli. We found that the early evoked gamma activity was insensitive to UMTS RF exposition. Our results support the notion, that a single 20 min irradiation from new generation 3G mobile phones does not induce measurable changes in latency or amplitude of ERP components or in oscillatory gamma-band activity in an auditory oddball paradigm.",Excluded,0.08992386
4057,"Peptide receptor radionuclide therapies (PRRTs): Which are the dosimetric data for the patients? Introduction: NeuroEndocrine Tumours (NETs) belong to a relatively rare class of neoplasms. Nonetheless, their prevalence has increased significantly during the last decades. Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) therapeutic effect is based on the binding of radiolabelled somatostatin analogue peptides with NETs' somatostatin receptors, resulting in internal irradiation of tumours. Pre-therapeutic patient-specific dosimetry is essential for a treatment course with high levels of safety and efficacy. This study reviews the methods and dosimetric results of PRRT dosimetry presented in the literature. Focus is given on data concerning the therapeutic somatostatin analogue radiopeptides <sup>111</sup>In-[DTPA<sup>0</sup>,DPhe<sup>1</sup>]- octreotide (<sup>111</sup>In-DTPA-octreotide), <sup>90</sup>Y-[DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>]-octreotide (<sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC) and <sup>177</sup>Lu-[DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>,Thr<sup>8</sup>]-octreotide (<sup>177</sup>Lu- DOTATATE).

Furthermore, papers presented herein were published during the last 15 years (1999 - 2013), with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE studies being published during the last 4 years (2010 - 2013). Additionally, selection was limited to papers providing dosimetric data for at least two regions of interest. Result(s): Dosimetric results are provided for tumors, kidneys, red marrow, liver and spleen, Following Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) committee formalism, dosimetric analysis demonstrates large interpatient variability in tumour and organ uptake, with kidneys and bone marrow being the critical organs. Results are dependent on the image acquisition and processing protocol, as well as the dosimetric imaging radiopharmaceutical. Discussion(s): The large interpatient variability in tumour and organ uptake stresses the need for personalized therapy planning. Patient-specific dosimetry in PRRT is therefore needed, in order for the fixed dose regimens to be replaced with patient-tailored therapy planning. Kidney absorbed doses are higher in PRRT with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC, allowing for higher <sup>177</sup>Lu activities to be administered in <sup>177</sup>Lu- DOTATATE therapies.

In the past few years, we have participated in several clinical studies designed to investigate fluorescence guided resection (FGR) and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Method(s): PPIX selectivity and PPIX bleaching during PDT were assessed with spectroscopic measurements. FGR was performed in 18 clinics in Germany (ALA-Glioma Study Group, participants see end of paper) in a phase III trial comprising an ALA group and a white-light group. PDT was performed with microlens fibers or cylindrical diffusers postsurgically to the resection bed. Additionally, a protocol for the interstitial stereotactic placement of cylindrical diffusers was established and applied on patients with recurrent, inoperable glioblastoma.

This report is intended to describe the experience with the first 150 patients treated with helical tomotherapy. Patient selection, time effort, handling of daily image guidance with megavoltage (MV) CT, and quality of radiation plans shall be assessed. Patients and Methods: Between July 2006 and May 2007, 150 patients were treated with helical tomotherapy in the University Hospital of Heidelberg. Mean age was 60 years with a minimum of 30 years and a maximum of 85 years. 79 of these patients received radiotherapy as a part of multimodal treatment pre- or postoperatively, 17 patients received treatment as a combined radiochemotherapy. 76% were treated with curative intent. Radiotherapy sites were central nervous system (n = 7), head and neck (n = 28), thoracic (n = 37), abdominal (n = 58) and skeletal system (n = 20). Most common tumor entities were prostate cancer (n = 28), breast cancer (n = 17), gastrointestinal tumors (n = 19), pharyngeal carcinoma (n = 14), lymphoma (n = 13), metastatic disease (bone n = 14, liver n = 6, lung n = 4, lymph node n = 2), sarcoma (n = 8), malignant pleural mesothelioma (n = 5), ovarian cancer treated with whole abdominal irradiation (n = 4), lung cancer (n = 3), skin malignancies (n = 3), chordoma (n = 2), meningioma (n = 2), one ependymoma and one medulloblastoma treated with craniospinal axis irradiation (n = 2), and others (n = 4). Nine patients were treated with single-fraction radiosurgery, nine with image-guided spinal reirradiation, and twelve patients were treated at multiple targets simultaneously. A pretreatment MV-CT scan was performed in 98.2% of the 3,026 fractions applied. After matching with the kilovoltage planning CT, corrections for translations and rotation around longitudinal axis (roll) were done. Result(s): Mean time on table was 24.8 min for the mentioned tumor entities with fractionated radiation, mean treatment time 10.7 min. Mean correction vector after MV-CT registration was 6.9 mm. With helical tomotherapy it was possible to achieve highly conformal dose distributions for targets of all sizes and multiple targets within one procedure.

This was feasible even if the desired immobilization was not possible due to obesity, claustrophobia, pain, or neurologic or orthopedic impairment. Conclusion(s): Helical tomotherapy and daily image guidance with MV-CT could fast be introduced into daily clinical routine. This technique allows precise intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in standard cases and offers new treatment options in a huge variety of difficult cases.

4068,"Repolarized macrophages, induced by intermediate stereotactic dose radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade, contribute to long-term survival in glioma-bearing mice INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a deadly brain tumor with a short expected median survival, despite current standard-of-care treatment. We explored the combination of intermediate stereotactic dose radiation therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy as a novel treatment strategy for GBM.METHODS: Glioma xenograft-bearing mice were exposed to high dose brain-directed radiation (10 Gy single exposure) as well as mouse anti-PD-1 antibody. The tumor-bearing animals were randomized to four groups: no treatment, radiation alone, anti-PD-1 alone, and radiation + anti-PD-1. Survival was followed, and tumor growth was monitored using MRI. Immunohistochemistry, gene expression arrays, and flow cytometry were used to characterize the treatment-induced effects. Pharmacologic inhibitors of T-lymphocytes, bone marrow derived macrophages, and microglia were used to assess the respective roles of different immune populations in observed treatment effects.RESULTS: We found the combined treatment with high dose radiation and immunotherapy to be highly effective with a 75% complete pathologic response and dramatically improved survival outcomes. We found both CD8+ T-cells and macrophages to be necessary for the full effect of combined therapy, with T lymphocytes appearing to play a role early on and macrophages mediating a later phase of the combined treatment effect. Radiation treatment appeared to trigger macrophage repolarization, increasing M1/M2 ratio.CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to a novel immunologic mechanism underlying the interaction between radiotherapy and immunotherapy. They also provide the basis for clinical investigation of immunogenic dose radiation in combination with immune checkpoint blockade as a potential treatment approach for newly diagnosed high grade gliomas.",Excluded,0.09047309
4069,"Cancer therapy, vomiting, and antiemetics Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy for cancer are capable of causing nausea and vomiting. With both treatment modalities, the nausea and vomiting is thought to be a second-order process rather than being due to direct stimulation of neuromechanisms that control vomiting. Both a peripheral (gastrointestinal tract) and central (chemoreceptor trigger zone) effect may be operating with both radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-induced vomiting. With radiotherapy, gastrointestinal toxicity is affected by the type of radiation, radiation dose and field size, fractionation schedule, individual patient factors, and the part of the patient that is radiated. Many different factors also influence the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy. With both radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting is probably mediated by a reduction in breakdown of various neurotransmitters. It is presumed that as the levels of neurotransmitters increase, nausea and vomiting develop. Antagonists of these neurotransmitters may afford some antiemetic protection. Nausea and vomiting may be so severe in patients with cancer that they may refuse potentially curative therapy because of it. Anticipatory nausea and vomiting may develop in patients who have become quite sick after receiving treatment. Exposure to stimuli associated with the emetogenic agent is then sufficient to trigger nausea and vomiting. Standard antiemetics do not help anticipatory nausea and vomiting, although behavioural training may. A variety of different drugs have proven useful as antiemetics, including dopamine antagonists such as phenothiazines, metoclopramide, corticosteroids (dexamethasone and methylprednisolone), cannabinoids, and benzodiazapines. Antihistamines and anticholinergics are of value in some situations. New serotonin antagonists appear to be very promising and are currently undergoing clinical studies. Multiagent antiemetic regimens appear to be more effective than single agent regimens in some situations. [References: 123]",Excluded,0.0879169
4070,"Long-term clinical safety of high proton radiation doses delivered with pencil beam scanning paradigm to the spinal cord for extracranial malignancies Purpose/Objective(s): Standardly employed radiotherapy dose limits for the spinal cord tend to be very conservative. Historical data from re-irradiation and combined photon/proton beam series suggest that the tolerance might be much higher. Nevertheless, uncertainties persist due to short follow-up, mixed techniques, and dose summation in these efforts. To add further clarity, we analyzed our institutional experience regarding the incidence of radiation-induced spinal cord toxicity following treatment exclusively with high dose, pencil beam scanning proton therapy (PBSPT). Materials/Methods: Seventy two patients (median age: 51, range 23-79; male/female ratio 1:1), treated for spinal chordoma (n=51) or chondrosarcoma (n=21), met the following criteria and were retrospectively analyzed: maximum dose to the spinal cord of >= 45 Gy (RBE), proton therapy only, >= 18 years of age, and clinical follow-up of >12 months. Patients received 64.0 e 74.4 Gy (RBE) (median: 74.0 Gy (RBE)), generally with 1.8-2.0 Gy (RBE) per fraction, between 2000 and 2014. The Dmax, D2%, V40, V45, V50, V55, and V60 of the spinal cord (SC) and center of spinal cord (CSC; 2-3 mm diameter ROI at geometric center of the cord) were calculated for all patients. Median follow-up was 66 months (range: 13-160 months). Toxicity was scored according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03). Descriptive and linear regression analyses were performed. Result(s): Patients received a mean Dmax / D2% to the spinal cord of 59 Gy (RBE) / 55 Gy (RBE) and to the CSC of 52 Gy (RBE) / 51 Gy (RBE), respectively. Four patients (6%) developed acute radiation-induced neurologic toxicity (Grade 1: nZ1, Grade 2: nZ3). Seventeen percent of patients experienced minor late neurologic toxicities (Grade 1: nZ7, Grade 2: nZ4). Of these patients, 4 developed Lhermitte's syndrome. One patient experienced Grade 4 toxicity (tetraplegia) after receiving 58 Gy (RBE) to the surface and 54 Gy (RBE) to the CSC (SC: V45 11.8 cc, V50 9.35 cc; CSC: V40 3.17 cc, V45 3.1 cc). Of note, the patient was considered high-risk due to postoperative, transient tetraparesis prior to PBSPT and potential spinal instability with a narrow canal. On final analysis, no significant correlation was found between spinal cord Dmax, CSC Dmax, or length of CTV and toxicity. However, higher CSC Dmax and longer CTV tended to correlate with >= Grade 2 neurologic toxicity, but this was not statistically significant. Conclusion(s): PBSPTwith spinal cord doses of up to 60Gy(RBE) to the surface and 50Gy (RBE) to the center is associatedwithminimal spinal toxicity. In our experience, doses up to 64 Gy (RBE) to the surface of the spinal cord are deemed acceptable if unavoidable in achieving adequate tumor coverage.",Excluded,0.088666916
4071,"Self-rotations in simulated microgravity: performance effects of strategy training INTRODUCTION: This research studies reorientation methodologies in a simulated microgravity environment using an experimental framework to reduce astronaut adaptation time and provide for a safety countermeasure during extravehicular activity.METHODS: There were 20 subjects (10 men, 10 women, mean age of 23.6 +/- 3.5) who were divided into 2 groups, fully trained and minimally trained, which determined the amount of motion strategy training received. Subjects performed a total of 48 rotations about their pitch, roll, and yaw axes in a suspension system that simulated microgravity. In each trial subjects either rotated 90 degrees in pitch, 90 degrees in roll, or 180 degrees in yaw. Experimental measures include subject coordination, performance time, cognitive workload assessments, and qualitative motion control strategies.RESULTS: Subjects in the fully trained group had better initial performance with respect to performance time and workload scores for the pitch and yaw rotations. Further, trained subjects reached a steady-state performance time in fewer trials than those with minimal training. The subjects with minimal training tended to use motions that were common in an Earth environment since no technique was provided. For roll rotations they developed motions that would have led to significant off-axis (pitch and yaw) rotations in a true microgravity environment.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that certain body axes are easier to rotate about than others and that fully trained subjects had an easier time performing the body rotations than the minimally trained subjects. This study has provided the groundwork for the development of an astronaut motion-control training program.",Excluded,0.08639462
4072,"Long-Term Outcomes and Patterns of Failure After Surgical Resection of Small-Cell Lung Cancer Background The role of surgical resection as a treatment option for early-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is controversial, and few data exist regarding the patterns of treatment failure in these patients. Patients and Methods The medical records of all patients receiving definitive surgical management of SCLC at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) from January 1, 1985 to December 31, 2012 were reviewed. Estimates of survival and recurrence risk were recorded using the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparative analyses were performed with Cox regression analysis. Results A total of 54 patients were identified. The median follow-up period was 5.9 years. At 5 years, overall survival was 37% and recurrence-free survival 44%. Intrathoracic recurrence, the most frequent treatment failure, occurred in 14 patients, with an estimated intrathoracic recurrence-free survival at 3 years of 64.4%. Patients undergoing wedge resection or segmentectomy, rather than lobectomy or pneumonectomy, had an increased risk of intrathoracic recurrence (hazard ratio, 3.5; P =.01). Overall survival was improved at 5 years after lobectomy or pneumonectomy compared with wedge resection or segmentectomy (48% vs. 15%, respectively; P =.03). Conclusion Surgical resection of SCLC can achieve reasonable treatment outcomes and can be considered for well-selected patients with clinical early-stage disease. Intrathoracic recurrence is the most common site of treatment failure. Caution should be taken with patients who are unable to tolerate at least lobectomy, because they are at a high risk of local recurrence. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.20428398
4073,"Reduced somatosensory hand representation in thalidomide-induced dysmelia as revealed by fMRI The concept of cerebral plasticity suggests that the hand representation in somatosensory cortex is abnormal in congenital malformation disorders. To investigate this issue we studied 11 subjects with different degrees of upper extremity dysmelia due to thalidomide embryopathy in comparison to 10 control subjects. In the affected subjects fingers are typically missing in radio-ulnar order beginning with the thumb. Haemodynamic responses to electrical stimulation of the radial-most and ulnar-most fingers were measured in each subject using functional magnetic resonance tomography. The size of the hand area in the primary somatosensory cortex was estimated by calculating the Euclidian distance between corresponding activation peaks on the lateral postcentral gyrus. The cortical somatosensory hand representation was found to be significantly smaller in dysmelic subjects as compared with the control subjects (P <0.001). The shrinkage of the hand area was not proportional to the number of missing fingers. Furthermore, the cortical representation of the ulnar fingers in the dysmelic subjects was shifted towards the cortical thumb representation of the control group. We suggest that the unproportional reduction of the hand area together with the observed shift may reflect use-dependent rather than malformation-induced reorganization of the somatosensory hand area.",Excluded,0.10888174
4074,"Single needle approach for multiple medial branch blocks: a new technique BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Medial branch blocks are an important tool for the diagnosis of facet joint arthropathy. The most commonly used technique involves multiple needle placements, one for each nerve blocked. This multiple needle technique may require a large amount of local anesthetic for anesthetizing the skin, thereby increasing the rate of false-positive blocks.TECHNIQUE: Diagnostic lumbar medial branch blocks are usually performed using multiple needles, one for each branch. The authors describe a different technique using a single needle for all levels. Initially, the needle is directed toward the medial branch located at the level of the affected facet joint in the antero-posterior view. After anesthetizing this nerve with local anesthetic, the same needle is withdrawn to the skin with the tip still in the subcutaneous tissue and repositioned to block the medial branch above, and thereafter below, while continuing to use only the antero-posterior view, thereby using only one entry site.CONCLUSIONS: When performed correctly, the single needle technique provides accuracy similar to the more conventional multiple needle approach during the performance of diagnostic facet joint nerve blocks. Because only one skin entry point is needed, however, this technique may afford several advantages over the multiple needle approach. These may include less patient discomfort, less time required and less radiation exposure since only one C-arm position is used, a smaller volume of local anesthetic, and possibly a lower incidence of false-positive blocks.",Excluded,0.08608262
4075,"White matter changes in breast cancer brain metastases patients who undergo radiosurgery alone compared to whole brain radiation therapy plus radiosurgery Delayed toxicity after whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is of increasing concern in patients who survive more than one year with brain metastases from breast cancer. Radiation-related white matter toxicity is detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and has been correlated with neurocognitive dysfunction. This study assessed the risk of developing white matter changes (WMC) in breast cancer patients who underwent either WBRT plus stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or SRS alone. We retrospectively compared 35 patients with breast cancer brain metastases who received WBRT and SRS to 30 patients who only received SRS. All patients had evaluable imaging at a median of one year after their initial management. The development of white matter T2 prolongation as detected by T2 or FLAIR imaging was graded: grade 1 = little or no white matter T2 hyperintensity; grade 2 = limited periventricular hyperintensity; and grade 3 = diffuse white matter hyperintensity. After WBRT plus SRS, patients demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of WMC (p < 0.0001). After one year, 71.5 % of patients whose treatment included WBRT demonstrated WMC (42.9 % grade 2; 28.6 % grade 3). Only one patient receiving only SRS developed WMC. In long-term survivors of breast cancer, the risk of WMC was significantly reduced when SRS alone was used for management. Further prospective studies are necessary to determine how these findings correlate with neurocognitive toxicity. WBRT usage as initial management of limited brain disease should be replaced by SRS alone to reduce the risk of delayed white matter toxicity.",Excluded,0.66347116
4076,"Fatigue in patients with cancers of the breast or prostate undergoing radical radiotherapy To determine the prevalence, severity, and correlates of fatigue among patients with cancers of the prostate or breast receiving high dose radiotherapy with curative intent, a prospective, questionnaire-based study evaluated a convenience sample of 62 patients who were about to start a course of radiotherapy. Patients were assessed immediately prior to treatment, and again within a week of finishing. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the Bidimensional Fatigue Scale (BFS). Quality of life was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQc30). Psychological distress was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Personality Traits were assessed using the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI). Fatigue severity increased significantly on 3 out of the 5 assessment instruments used. Radiotherapy was associated with a decline in global quality of life, role, cognitive and social functioning, and an increase in nausea/vomiting, pain, insomnia, diarrhea, and financial difficulty. At baseline, 39% of the variation in fatigue scores among the patients could be explained by a combination of measures of their global quality of life and physical functioning. A combination of fatigue and anxiety scores at baseline was able to predict 54% of the variation in fatigue scores at the completion of radiotherapy. These data indicate that fatigue is a significant problem for patients receiving radical radiotherapy, although its severity is relatively modest.",Excluded,0.7342927
4077,"Possible role of mitochondria in posttetanic potentiation of GABAergic synaptic transmission in rat neocortical cell cultures It has been previously demonstrated that mitochondria are of crucial importance for posttetanic potentiation (PTP) at neuromuscular junction. The aim of our study was to examine whether this may also be the case at a central synapse. To address this question, we studied possible mitochondrial involvement in PTP of GABAergic synaptic transmission in rat neocortical cultures, a preparation in which PTP has not been previously documented. Synaptic responses were evoked by local extracellular stimulation. Whole-cell patch-clamp technique was employed to record inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) from postsynaptic neurons. Tetanic stimulation (30 Hz, 4 s) of the presynaptic neuron evoked an increase of IPSC amplitude, lasting for about 1 min. PTP was accompanied by a decrease of coefficient of variation of the IPSC and a decrease of paired-pulse (IPSC(2)/IPSC(1)) ratio, indicating involvement of presynaptic mechanism(s) in PTP. Possible role of mitochondria in PTP was addressed using drugs affecting Ca(2+) uptake and subsequent Ca(2+) efflux: carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and tetraphenylphosphonium ions (TPP(+)). It was found that both CCCP (1-2 microM) and TPP(+) (10 microM) either substantially decreased or eliminated PTP. These results further confirm presynaptic origin of PTP in neocortical neurons and suggest an important role of mitochondrial Ca(2+) turnover in this form of synaptic plasticity at the central synapse.",Excluded,0.08647396

4080,"Patterns of Failure after Stereotactic Radiosurgery of the Resection Cavity Following Surgical Removal of Brain Metastases BACKGROUND: Whole brain radiation treatment (WBRT) is considered standard treatment for BM. However, exposing large volumes of normal brain tissue to irradiation can cause neurotoxicity. This study describes our experience with 100 consecutive patients with brain metastases who were managed with surgical extirpation followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the resection cavity.METHODS: Patients with 1-3 brain metastases (BM), who underwent resection of 1-2 BM between June 2005 and December 2013, were treated with SRS directed to the tumor cavity and for any synchronous BM. Local and distant treatment failures were determined based on neuroimaging. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for local and distant failure rates and overall survival.RESULTS: One hundred and two resection cavities were treated with SRS in 100 consecutive patients. Thirty-two additional synchronous metastases were treated in 27 patients during the same session. The median overall survival was 18.9 months. Local control rate at 1 year was 84%. Longer delays between surgery and SRS were associated with increased risk of local failure (hazard ratio, -1.46; P = 0.02). Distant progression occurred in 44% of the patients at a mean of 8.8 +/- 6.6 months after SRS treatment. Ten cases of leptomeningeal spread occurred around the resection cavities (9.8%). Central nervous system failure was not significantly associated with survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that recursive partitioning analysis and active systemic disease were significantly associated with survival.CONCLUSION: The strategy described provides acceptable local disease control when compared with WBRT following surgery. This approach can delay and even annul WBRT in the majority of selected BM patients, especially recursive partitioning analysis class I patients.

Targeting the CD95 apoptotic pathway is a promising experimental approach to these neoplasms. Here, we asked whether irradiation modulates CD95-mediated apoptosis of human malignant glioma cells in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODS: LN-18, LN-229 and T98G human malignant glioma cell lines were irradiated with dosages from 0-8 Gy and treated with CD95L (CD95 ligand). CD95 expression was assessed by flow cytometry. Caspase activity was determined by DEVD cleavage. Cytotoxic effects were assessed by crystal violet staining of cells in a 96-well plate assay. Clonogenic cell death was determined by a standard colony forming assay.RESULTS: We find that (i) CD95L-induced apoptosis, but not irradiation-induced clonogenic cell death, involves caspase 3 activation and is blocked by the viral caspase inhibitor, crm-A. (ii) Irradiation does not modulate CD95 expression either in p53 wild-type or in p53 mutant glioma cell lines, and does not enhance CD95L-evoked caspase 3 activity or CD95L-induced clonogenic cell death.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that endogenous CD95/CD95L interactions are not involved in radiation-induced clonogenic cell death and that the killing cascades of CD95L and irradiation are independent in human malignant glioma cells.",Excluded,0.76900315
4082,"Reducing the dosimetric impact of positional errors in field junctions for craniospinal irradiation using VMAT AIM: To improve treatment plan robustness with respect to small shifts in patient position during the VMAT treatment by ensuring a linear ramp-like dose profile in treatment field overlap regions.BACKGROUND: Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is considered technically challenging because the target size exceeds the maximal field size, which necessitates using abutted or overlapping treatment fields. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is increasingly being examined for CSI, as it offers both better dose homogeneity and better dose conformance while also offering a possibility to create field junctions which are more robust towards small shifts in patient position during the treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A VMAT treatment plan with three isocenters was made for a test case patient. Three groups of overlapping arc field pairs were used; one for the cranial and two for the spinal part. In order to assure a ramp-like dose profile in the field overlap region, the upper spinal part was optimised first, with dose prescription explicitly enforcing a ramp-like dose profile. The cranial and lower spinal part were done afterwards, taking into account the dose contribution of the upper spinal fields.RESULTS: Using simple geometrical reasoning, we demonstrated that hot- and cold spots which arise from small displacement of one treatment field relative to the other treatment field can be reduced by taking two precautions: (a) widening the field overlap region, and (b) reducing the field gradient across the overlap region. The function with the smallest maximal gradient is a linear ramp. We present a treatment planning technique which yields the desired dose profile of the two contributing fields, and minimises dosimetric dependence on minor positional errors in patient set-up.",Excluded,0.08587386
4083,"Crossed cerebellar diaschisis after stroke identified noninvasively with cerebral blood flow-weighted arterial spin labeling MRI BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) is most commonly investigated using hemodynamic PET and SPECT imaging. However, noninvasive MRI offers advantages of improved spatial resolution, allowing hemodynamic changes to be compared directly with structural findings and without concerns related to ionizing radiation exposure. The aim of this study was to evaluate relationships between CCD identified from cerebral blood flow (CBF)-weighted arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI with cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR)-weighted blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) MRI, Wallerian degeneration, clinical motor impairment, and corticospinal tract involvement.METHODS: Subjects (n=74) enrolled in an ongoing observational stroke trial underwent CBF-weighted ASL and hypercapnic CVR-weighted BOLD MRI. Hemispheric asymmetry indices for basal cerebellar CBF, cerebellar CVR, and cerebral peduncular area were compared between subjects with unilateral supratentorial infarcts (n=18) and control subjects without infarcts (n=16). CCD required (1) supratentorial infarct and (2) asymmetric cerebellar CBF (>95% confidence interval relative to controls).RESULTS: In CCD subjects (n=9), CVR (p=0.04) and cerebral peduncular area (p<0.01) were significantly asymmetric compared to controls. Compared to infarct subjects not meeting CCD criteria (n=9), CCD subjects had no difference in corticospinal tract location for infarct (p=1.0) or motor impairment (p=0.08).CONCLUSIONS: CCD correlated with cerebellar CVR asymmetry and Wallerian degeneration. These findings suggest that noninvasive MRI may be a useful alternative to PET or SPECT to study structural correlates and clinical consequences of CCD following supratentorial stroke.",Excluded,0.095961325

Other populations with similar reduced responses have shown improved immunogenicity to a high-dose vaccine. OBJECTIVE(S): A pilot prospective cohort study was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity of the Fluzone High-Dose influenza vaccine in patients with CNS malignancy. METHOD(S): Baseline data on diagnosis, chemotherapy, radiation, glucocorticoids, and timing of treatment were collected. All patients underwent vaccination with of the Fluzone High-Dose influenza vaccine. Serum samples are actively being collected at baseline, day 28, and 3 months following vaccine administration. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers will be measured to determine seroconversion (4-fold rise) and seroprotection (titer 1:40). RESULT(S): A total of 27 patients were enrolled. Mean age at baseline was 52.7 years (+/-12.6);41% male; 93% white and 7% black. Diagnoses included high-grade glioma (85%), CNS lymphoma (11%), and meningioma (4%). At enrollment, 8 patients (30%) were taking glucocorticoids, 4 (15%) were undergoing active radiation, 14 (52%) were on chemotherapy, and 5 (19%) began chemotherapy following vaccine administration. Prior radiation (n = 19, 70%) and chemotherapy (n = 14, 52%) were common. Seven patients (26%) reported post-vaccination symptoms potentially attributable to vaccination; 6 experienced only local soreness or redness at the injection site and 1 suffered headache, nausea, vomiting. All symptoms were transient and resolved completely. At baseline, 8 patients (30%) had absolute CD4 < 300. Serum samples for HAI assay are being collected. Seroconversion and seroprotection rates are forthcoming. CONCLUSION(S): Studies have shown that populations known to respond poorly to standard yearly influenza vaccination (e.g. the elderly) can mount an effective immunologic response to the high-dose vaccine.

Grids of thermoluminescence dosemeters were attached on the head of the patient. The exposure parameters of the X-ray systems and the clinical procedures were fully documented. While for the diagnostic procedure, the dose threshold of 2 Gy for deterministic effects was not reached, this situation was much different for the embolisations. For angiography of the carotid arteries, no skin doses were measured >320 mGy. For the cerebral embolisations, maximum skin doses up to 5.4 Gy were measured. Doses to the patients varied largely between different hospitals and within the same hospital for similar procedures. On the one hand, the complexity of the pathology for interventional procedures was responsible for the large variability in dose. On the other hand, large differences in clinical protocol and technical parameters of the X-ray systems, explaining the dose variations, were also observed. A correlation was found between the maximum skin dose measured on a patient and the total dose-area product (DAP) value for cerebral embolisations. This correlation makes it possible to estimate the maximum skin dose from these DAP values and to determine a trigger level.

This approach has recently been changed for patients with unifocal recurrent gliomas. What began during the 1990's as a large clinical trial utilizing GliaSite Radiotherapy System, is currently becoming standard of care. This radiotherapy system consists of an inflatable balloon catheter, 2, 3, or 4 cm diameter, which is surgically placed in the tumor resection cavity; its positioning and the level of conformity within the cavity are verified via MRI imaging with contrast. The balloon is then filled with appropriate volume of <sup>125</sup>I in the liquid form. Radiation treatment prescription dose ranges from 40 to 60 Gy (4,000 to 6,000 rads). This is accomplished by allowing 2.77 to 16.6 GBq (75 to 450 mCi) of <sup>125</sup>I to remain in the balloon for 3-5 d. Numerous technical, dosimetric, and logistical considerations arise when handling large quantities of iodine necessary to perform GliaSite procedures.

These include neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala, in the linked part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, in periventricular hypothalamic neurons, dorsal raphe nucleus, reticular thalamic nucleus and autonomic, endocrine as well as sensory and motor components of the brainstem and spinal cord. Additional to the eye-regulated ""suprachiasmatic clock"", existence of a soltriol-vitamin D regulated neural ""timing circuit(s)"" is proposed. Both, activational and organizational effects of soltriol on mature and developing brain regions, respectively are likely to play a role in the regulation of neuronal functions that include the modulation and entrainment of biorhythms. Soltriol's central effects correlate with peripheral effects on elements in skin, bone, teeth, kidney, intestine, heart and blood vessels, endocrine organs, and tissues of the immune and reproductive system.

We aimed to establish translatable mouse models of disseminated prostate cancer (PCa) to evaluate effectiveness of <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-617 at various disease stages. <b>Methods</b>: C4-2, C4-2B, or 22Rv1 cells were injected into the left ventricle of male NSG mice. Disease progression was monitored using bioluminescence imaging (BLI). For treatment, mice were injected with 40 kBq <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-617 at one (early treatment cohort) or three weeks (late treatment cohort) post-inoculation. Treatment efficacy was monitored by BLI of whole-body tumor burden. Mice were sacrificed based on body conditioning score. <b>Results</b>: C4-2 cells yielded metastases in liver, lungs, spleen, stomach, bones, and brain - achieving a clinically relevant model of widespread metastatic disease. The disease burden in the early treatment cohort was stable over 27 weeks in 5/9 mice and progressive in 4/9 mice. These mice were sacrificed due to brain metastases. Median survival of the late treatment cohort was superior to controls (13 vs. 7 weeks; p<0.0001) but inferior to that in the early treatment cohort (13 vs. 27 weeks; p<0.001). Late cohort mice succumbed to extensive liver involvement. The 22Rv1 and C4-2B systemic models were not used for treatment due to high kidney metastatic burden or low take rate, respectively. <b>Conclusion</b>: C4-2 cells reproduced metastatic cancer spread most relevantly. Early treatment with <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-617 prevented liver metastases and led to significant survival benefit. Late treatment improved survival without reducing tumor burden in the liver, the main site of metastasis.

She had lost 25 kg in weight over 13 months.EXAMINATION: Physical examination, laboratory tests, radiology and gastroscopy were unremarkable. Gastric scintigraphy showed abnormally prolonged emptying.TREATMENT AND COURSE: Nausea and vomiting stopped at once after erythromycin (a motilin agonist) had been administered. It was at first given intravenously after meals (50 mg three times daily for 5 days), then orally for 10 weeks (250 mg three times daily before meals). Subsequent examination revealed normal gastric emptying. The symptoms did not recur after erythromycin had been discontinued.CONCLUSION: Erythromycin is an effective drug against gastroparesis caused by radiotherapy, because it acts even when the enteric nerves are damaged.

4094,"Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7, mda-7/IL-24, selectively induces growth suppression, apoptosis and radiosensitization in malignant gliomas in a p53-independent manner Malignant gliomas are extremely aggressive cancers currently lacking effective treatment modalities. Gene therapy represents a promising approach for this disease. A requisite component for improving gene-based therapies of brain cancer includes tumor suppressor genes that exhibit cancer constrained inhibitory activity. Subtraction hybridization identified melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (mda-7) as a gene associated with melanoma cell growth, differentiation and progression. Ectopic expression of mda-7 by means of a replication-incompetent adenovirus (Ad), Ad.mda-7, induces growth suppression and apoptosis selectively in diverse human cancers, without producing any apparent harmful effect in normal cells. We presently demonstrate that Ad.mda-7 induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in malignant human gliomas expressing both mutant and wild-type p53, and these effects correlate with an elevation in expression of members of the growth arrest and DNA damage (GADD) gene family. In contrast, infection with a recombinant Ad expressing wild-type p53, Ad.wtp53, specifically affects mutant p53 expressing gliomas. When tested in early passage normal and immortal human fetal astrocytes, growth inhibition resulting from infection with Ad.mda-7 or Ad.wtp53 is significantly less than in malignant gliomas and no toxicity is evident in these normal cells. Moreover, infection of gliomas with Ad.mda-7 or treatment with purified GST-MDA-7 protein sensitizes both wild-type and mutant p53 expressing tumor cells to the growth inhibitory and antisurvival effects of ionizing radiation, and this response correlates with increased expression of specific members of the GADD gene family. Since heterogeneity in p53 expression is common in evolving gliomas, the present findings suggest that Ad.mda-7 may, in many instances, prove more beneficial for the gene-based therapy of malignant gliomas than administration of wild-type p53.",Excluded,0.08569533
4095,"Targeting CREB inhibits radiation-induced neuroendocrine differentiation and increases radiation-induced cell death in prostate cancer cells Neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) is a process by which prostate cancer cells transdifferentiate into neuroendocrine-like (NE-like) cancer cells. Accumulated evidence suggests that NED is associated with disease progression and therapy resistance in prostate cancer patients. We previously reported that by mimicking a clinical radiotherapy protocol, fractionated ionizing radiation (FIR) induces NED in prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, FIR-induced NED constitutes two distinct phases: a radioresistance phase in which a fraction of cells selectively survive during the first two week irradiation, and a neuroendocrine differentiation phase in which surviving cells differentiate into NE-like cancer cells during the second two week irradiation. We have also observed increased activation of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein during the course of FIR-induced NED. To determine whether targeting NED can be explored as a radiosensitization approach, we employed two CREB targeting strategies, CREB knockdown and overexpression of ACREB, a dominant-negative mutant of CREB, to target both phases. Our results showed that ACREB expression increased FIR-induced cell death and sensitized prostate cancer cells to radiation. Consistent with this, knockdown of CREB also inhibited FIR-induced NED and sensitized prostate cancer cells to radiation. Molecular analysis suggests that CREB targeting primarily increases radiation-induced pre-mitotic apoptosis. Taken together, our results suggest that targeting NED could be developed as a radiosensitization approach for prostate cancer radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.0881085

In pentobarbitone-anaesthetised rats, application of MV at combined high frequencies and volumes (representing threshold levels) produced apnea. The apnea persisted as long as MV was maintained at or above the threshold frequency and volume. Following removal of MV, inherent breathing did not resume immediately, with the diaphragm exhibiting post-mechanical ventilation apnea. The fall in arterial P(CO2) (Pa(CO2)) levels evoked by MV-engendered hyperventilation was shown not to be the trigger for initiation of apnea. MV-induced apnea was immediately reversed by bilateral vagotomy. Further, MV-induced apnea could not be evoked in bilaterally vagotomized animals suggesting that vagal feedback is the critical pathway for its initiation. NTS inspiratory neurones were inhibited during both MV-induced apnea and post-mechanical ventilation apnea, implying the involvement of central neural mechanisms in mediating this effect.",Excluded,0.085979655
4099,"Targeting of externalized alphaB-crystallin on irradiated endothelial cells with pro-thrombotic vascular targeting agents: Potential applications for brain arteriovenous malformations BACKGROUND: Vascular targeting uses molecular markers on the surface of diseased vasculature for ligand-directed drug delivery to induce vessel occlusion or destruction. In the absence of discriminatory markers, such as in brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), stereotactic radiosurgery may be used to prime molecular changes on the endothelial surface. This study explored alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) as a radiation induced target and pre-tested the specificity and efficacy of a CRYAB-targeting coaguligand for in vitro thrombus induction.METHODS: A parallel-plate flow system was established to circulate human whole blood over a layer of human brain endothelial cells. A conjugate of anti-CRYAB antibody and thrombin was injected into the circuit to compare binding and thrombus formation on cells with or without prior radiation treatment (0-25 Gy).RESULTS: Radiation increased CRYAB expression and surface exposure in human brain endothelial cells. In the parallel-plate flow system, the targeted anti-CRYAB-thrombin conjugate increased thrombus formation on the surface of irradiated cells relative to non-irradiated cells and to a non-targeting IgG-thrombin conjugate. Fibrin deposition and accumulation of fibrinogen degradation products increased significantly at radiation doses at or above 15 Gy with conjugate concentrations of 1.25 and 2.5 mug/mL.CONCLUSIONS: CRYAB exposure can be detected at the surface of human brain endothelial cells in response to irradiation. Pro-thrombotic CRYAB-targeting conjugates can bind under high flow conditions and in the presence of whole blood induce stable thrombus formation with high specificity and efficacy on irradiated surfaces.

BSM originated from the lung (n = 18, 75.0%), colon (n = 3, 12.5%), and breast (n = 3, 12.5%). The median patient age was 67.0 (range: 42-80) years. Recursive partition analysis classified 2 patients as class I, 17 as class II, and 5 as class III. Overall survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Tumor volume ranged from 0.01 to 7.49 cm<sup>3</sup> (median: 0.233 cm<sup>3</sup>), and patients were treated with a dose of 24-40 Gy in 7-13 fractions. The median OS was 9 months after fSRT (95% confidence interval 4.104-13.896).

To date, we have demonstrated that optogenetic sensory nerve stimulation rapidly alters the dopamine (DA) content within the mNAc. However, the physiological role and biochemical processes underlying such rapid and regional dynamics of DA remain unclear. In this study, using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), we observed that sensitized pain stimulation by optogenetic sensory nerve activation increased DA and 3-Methoxytyramine (3-MT; a post-synaptic metabolite obtained following DA degradation) in the mNAc of the experimental mice. To delineate the mechanism associated with elevation of DA and 3-MT, the de novo synthesized DA in the VTA/substantia nigra terminal areas was evaluated using IMS by visualizing the metabolic conversion of stable isotope-labeled tyrosine (<sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N-Tyr) to DA. Our approach revealed that at steady state, the de novo synthesized DA occupied >10% of the non-labeled DA pool in the NAc within 1.5h of isotope-labeled Tyr administration, despite no significant increase following pain stimulation. These results suggested that sensitized pain triggered an increase in the release and postsynaptic intake of DA in the mNAc, followed by its degradation, and likely delayed de novo DA synthesis. In conclusion, we demonstrated that short, peripheral nerve excitation with mechanical stimulation accelerates the mNAc-specific DA signaling and metabolism which might be associated with the development of mechanical allodynia.",Excluded,0.08568415

Epigenetic regulation has emerged as an important component of malignant tumor pathogenesis, although the contribution in the progression of benign pituitary tumors remains largely unexplored. The present study evaluates the effect of anacardic acid (6-pentadecyl salicylic acid), a natural histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, on pituitary adenoma cells.METHODS: The concentration- and time-dependent effects of anacardic acid on the viability of GH3 and MMQ pituitary adenoma cells were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazoyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cell cycle phase distribution, protein expression, and percentage of apoptotic cells were assessed by flow cytometry and Western blotting. Colony forming assays were used to study the radiosensitizing effect of anacardic acid.RESULTS: The present study identifies a novel antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect of anacardic acid on pituitary adenoma cells. These effects were associated with an increase in poly([adenosine diphosphate]-ribose) polymerase cleavage, sub-G1 arrest, and annexin V staining, consistent with apoptotic cell death; however, the pancaspase inhibitor carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone failed to reverse anacardic acid-induced cell death, suggesting a possible nonclassical apoptotic mechanism. Anacardic acid also reduced the expression of survivin and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, antiapoptotic proteins associated with cellular survival and radioresistance, and radiosensitized pituitary adenoma cells.CONCLUSIONS: These findings warrant further exploration of anacardic acid as a single agent or as an adjunct to radiation therapy for the treatment of pituitary tumors.",Excluded,0.086074695

Cells were pre-treated with caffeine for inhibiting ATM/ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein/ATM and Rad-3-related protein) activation, wherever required.RESULTS: A 47-49 kDa protein band was observed with antibodies against three different epitopes, demonstrating conservation of respective domains in Sfp53. Immunoprecipitation also yielded similar-sized protein. Degenerate RT-PCR resulted in product of same size in both cell lines. Similar gel mobility shift of p53-binding oligonucleotide with BMG-1 and Sf9 cell lysates indicated analogous transcriptional activity of Sfp53. Constitutive Sfp53 level was higher than hp53 (human p53) and showed primarily cytoplasmic localization. Radiation-induced accumulation was considerably less in Sf9 even as an analogous ATM/ATR-dependent nuclear translocation was observed following gamma-irradiation and etoposide.CONCLUSIONS: A smaller-sized Sfp53 orthologue shows highly conserved native structure with DNA-binding, N-terminus and C-terminus domains, and has analogous p53 transcriptional activity. While its nuclear translocation and ATM/ATR dependence were similar to hp53, the cytoplasmic localization and subdued accumulation following gamma-irradiation indicate functional differences from human cells.",Included,0.26704544

In Cox's multivariate analysis the strongest risk indicator for radiation cataract (RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.6) and vitreous haemorrhage (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8) was the height of the tumour; for neovascular glaucoma the TNM class (RR 6.2, 95% CI 2.7-13.8); for radiation maculopathy location of posterior tumour margin within 2 mm from the fovea (RR 3.4, 95% CI 2.0-6.0); and for radiation optic neuropathy location of tumour margin within 1 DD of the optic disc (RR 6.1, 95% CI 3.0-12.4). The 3 and 5 year probabilities of avoiding enucleation were 92% and 85%, respectively.

LL seemingly abolished the c-Fos rhythm in the whole SCN, while the rhythm persisted in the vl- and dm-SCN. In the dm-SCN, the rhythm of c-Fos-ir was phase-delayed by about 4 h in LL, whereas the rhythm of PER1-ir was affected just slightly.

We introduce our experiences in subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS for primary dystonia and tardive dystonia in this chapter. We propose that STN DBS has the following advantages over GPi DBS: (1) symptomatic improvement is seen immediately after stimulation, allowing us to quickly select the most suitable stimulation parameters; (2) the stimulation parameters for the STN are lower than those used for the GPi, resulting in longer battery life; and (3) STN DBS results in better symptomatic control than GPi DBS in dystonia patients when our STN data is compared to that obtained by others with using the GPi as the target.

However, brain metastases are often observed after PCI, and the optimal treatment for these brain metastases is still unclear.

Method(s): Between December 2000 and December 2012, 228 patients with LD-SCLC were treated and 98 of these patients with a complete response (CR) or a near CR to chemoradiotherapy underwent PCI at the National Cancer Center Hospital. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and imaging data for these 98 patients. Result(s): Twenty-four (24%) of the 98 patients developed brain metastases after PCI. The characteristics of the 24 patients were as follows: median age, 62 years (49-72 years), male/female, 21/3; performance status 0/1/2, 2/16/6. Twelve (50%) of the 24 patients had cranial recurrences only. Twelve patients had single brain metastases, and 12 patients had multiple lesions. Nine patients had neurological symptoms due to brain metastases. The median period after PCI until the appearance of the metastases was 9.9 months (1.1-34.9 months). Fifteen (63%) of the 24 patients underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (gamma knife radiosurgery [GKRS]), and one patient received whole brain radiotherapy. Six patients were treated with chemotherapy plus best supportive care (BSC), and two patients underwent BSC alone. The 15 patients who received GKRS had brain metastases with/without extracranial lesions (7 with, 8 without); three were symptomatic, and 12 were asymptomatic. The median number of brain metastases at the time of the first GKRS was one (range, 1-4). The local control rate of the lesions treated with GKRS was 86.7% (complete response in 3 patients, partial response in 7 patients, and stable disease in 3 patients). Five patients underwent further GKRS because of newly developing brain metastases (median: 4 times, range: 2-7 times). The median intracranial control time of the 15 patients was 6.8 months. The median survival time of the 15 patients was 29.3 months after the initial diagnosis, 13.7 months after the development of brain metastases, and 12.7 months after the treatment of GKRS. The median survival time of the patients without extracranial lesions was 20.2 months after the development of brain metastases and tended to be longer than that of the patients with extracranial lesions (12.6 months). Severe adverse events arising from GKRS were not observed in this series. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery may be an effective option as a salvage therapy for brain metastases after PCI in patients with LD-SCLC.",Excluded,0.5179562

We have been working to apply this technology for seizure control in chronically implanted animals. We have developed electronics for simultaneously recording neural activity while stimulating with low frequency fields. We have observed transient entrainment of spike and wave activity during spontaneous seizures with open loop sinusoidal stimulation with frequencies between 9-15 Hz. This is the first demonstration of low frequency field modulation of neural activity in chronically implanted mammalian brain.,Excluded,0.08584326
4118,"MR spectroscopy in radiation injury Detecting a new area of contrast enhancement in or in the vicinity of a previously treated brain tumor always causes concern for both the patient and the physician. The question that immediately arises is whether this new lesion is recurrent tumor or a treatment effect. The differentiation of recurrent tumor or progressive tumor from radiation injury after radiation therapy is often a radiologic dilemma regardless the technique used, CT or MR imaging. The purpose of this article was to review the utility of one of the newer MR imaging techniques, MR spectroscopy, to distinguish recurrent tumor from radiation necrosis or radiation injury.

4120,"Re-irradiation with hypo-fractionated stereotactic robotic radiotherapy for salvage in adult patients with brainstem glioma PURPOSE: Brainstem glioma (BSG) is often treated with definitive irradiation. However, subsequent progression and death occur as a rule rather than the exception, after varying periods of control. The outlook of patients with post-irradiation progression is dismal, and most of these patients are treated with supportive care alone. Despite the obvious risks with an area as critical as the brainstem, it is a possibility to encounter situations wherein the patients (themselves or their associates) ask for re-irradiation, with the hope of a few extra months of life. The risk of radiation-induced brainstem toxicity may be justifiable under the strict assumption that the patients stand a chance of benefiting from re-irradiation but still may not live long enough to manifest brainstem toxicity.METHODS: Five adult BSG patients were treated with re-irradiation using robotic-arm stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) between September 2009 and July 2012, primarily at the request of the concerned patient parties. Re-irradiation doses ranged from 16 to 25 Gray (Gy) delivered by robotic arm stereotactic irradiation in 2-5 fractions.RESULTS: Four out of five patients enjoyed a prolongation of survival in the order of months (three, five, six, and 14 months), which was very significant given that all patients had severe neurological compromise and poor performance status prior to re-irradiation. One patient has survived 36 months after re-irradiation and thus has lived long enough to manifest late radiation-induced brainstem toxicity.CONCLUSION: Despite the obvious risks of brainstem toxicity associated with the use of re-irradiation for BSG, the use of fractionated stereotactic re-irradiation seems to offers prospects of additional periods of local control and augments duration of life.",Excluded,0.08959929

Secondary analysis utilized the rpart function to recursively partition overall survival by numerous clinical and genetic pre-treatment and treatment-related variables. A tertiary analysis recursively partitioned a subset of patients in which the status of all genetic markers were known.

We have retrospectively analyzed 24 patients treated with IMRT. Five were selected within each of the following regions: head and neck, thoracic, abdomen, and prostate. Four patients were optimized within the brain region. The clinically treated plans were re-optimized using Philips Pinnacle3 v. 8 with the direct machine parameter optimization algorithm. The number of segments per beam from the treated plan was systematically reduced by 80%, 60%, 40%, and 30%, and the following statistics have been analyzed for plan quality: target min, mean, and max doses; critical structure doses; and integral dose. We have attempted to define the smallest number of segments per beam for IMRT treatment plans. Results indicate that IMRT plans can be delivered with acceptable quality with approximately 3-6 segments per beam for the anatomical regions analyzed. A reduction in the number of segments decreases treatment delivery time, reduces machine wear and tear, and minimizes the amount of time the patient is on the treatment table, which in turn reduces the chances of intrafractional uncertainties.",Excluded,0.087137595

4125,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation in SCLC Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has well established place in therapy for patients with limited-disease small cell lung cancer who responded to treatment. The data from randomized trials document that PCI reduces brain metastases rate from approximately 60% to 30%, and increases 3-year overall survival by approximately 5%. Currently, the dose of 25 Gy in 10 fractions is considered as standard. In attempt to reduce neuropsychological sequelae attributable to PCI hippocampal sparing techniques are employed. The existing studies suggest the benefit of hippocampal sparing in limiting memory and higher neurocognitive function losses, but with a risk of failures in the spared region. Ongoing studies will further validate the role of hippocampal sparing, both in terms of toxicity reduction and metastases prevention. PCI for patients who have undergone resection for stage I small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is not recommended, PCI may be, however, associated with a favourable outcome in SCLC patients who have undergone complete surgery in stages II-III. The role of PCI in extensive-disease (ED) SCLC has been evolving. Most recent evidence indicate that PCI is controversial in ED patients with response to initial chemotherapy and absence of brain metastases confirmed by contrast-enhanced MRI. The patients who do not receive PCI, must, however, receive periodic MRI examination during follow-up, i.e., remain under active surveillance with access to radiotherapy at brain relapse. The assessment of safety and effectiveness of hippocampal-sparing PCI, with or without drug neuroprotection in consideration of diverse combinations of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy create a background for future directions of research.

Material(s) and Method(s): Our phantom comprised two components, i.e., a hollow-fiber hemodialyzer to pump the diluted contrast material and a surrounding syringe-shaped X-ray-absorbing body to simulate the absorption of X-rays by a brain and cranium. We performed CTP scans on the phantom under various dose conditions ranging from 20 to 140 mA using a 64-row CT scanner, measuring experimental cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), and time to peak (TTP) values using a deconvolution algorithm. Result(s): The theoretical value of the CBV was within the 95% confidence interval of CBV values measured under 80 mA. The CBV measured under low-dose settings and all CBF values measured were smaller than the theoretically calculated ones, and all MTT values measured were larger. All measured values of the CBV, CBF, MTT, and TTP decreased with an increase in image noise under lower dose conditions. Conclusion(s): It is difficult to define a low-dose limit in clinical scan conditions because of the complex characteristics of perfusion indices.

Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated 35 patients with SAH who underwent contrast-enhanced dual-phase CTA within 24 hours from onset. The second-phase scan was performed 8 or 15 seconds following the usual CTA. The frequency of contrast extravasation was compared between phases. We also recorded the time from onset, coma level, interventional treatment, and early mortality. Result(s): Of 35 patients (22.9%) with SAH, 8 showed contrast extravasation in the second phase compared with 3 in the first phase. Contrast extravasation was correlated with clinical coma level (P < 0.05), and all contrast extravasation was found within 6 hours from onset. Early mortality, treatment decision, and hematoma distribution type did not correlate with existence of contrast extravasation. We also observed 4 cases of secondary subpial hematoma due to SAH, with 3 showing extravasation in both phases. Conclusion(s): Dual-phase CTA with a short interval enhances detection frequency of contrast extravasation in SAH and might be a better evaluation tool for SAH.

4129,"Perceptual costs for motion transparency evaluated by two performance measures Transparency perception is recognized as one of the important phenomena to understand the computational mechanism of early visual system. Transparency perception indicates that a simple theory reconstructing a single-valued field of a visual attribute, such as an optical-flow field, cannot model the neural mechanism for the human visual system and raises a fundamental issue of how visual attributes are represented and detected in the brain. It is considered that one of the important cues to reveal the neural encoding mechanism for overlapping surfaces is the perceptual cost in transparency perception. It has been known that the perceptual performance in motion transparency is worse than that expected from single motion perception. This perceptual ""cost"" would reflect the encoding strategy for transparent motions. Here we present a systematic study comparing the perceptual costs in motion transparency evaluated by two performance measures. The result showed that the properties of the perceptual costs varied with the performance measures. The perceptual cost evaluated by the motion detection threshold became smaller as a directional difference between overlapping motions increased, whereas the cost examined with the precision of directional judgments became worse. A computational analysis suggests that these contradictory results cannot be explained by a simple population coding model for motion directions.",Excluded,0.08672444

Pretreatment hematologic markers (platelet count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and lactate dehydrogenase) and other clinical characteristics were evaluated for correlation with brain metastases-free survival (BMFS). Cutoffs were established with receiver operating characteristics curves. Factors significant in univariate analysis were used to build a multivariate Cox model for BMFS. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 14.3 months.

The aim of this study was to quantify late effects in renal cortex of nude mice exposed to high amounts of [(177)Lu]-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate ([(177)Lu]-DOTATATE), and to determine whether a threshold dose value exists for these findings.METHODS: Nude mice were exposed to 90, 120 or 150 MBq of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE. Renal toxicity was evaluated up to 6 months after injection. Blood samples were collected to examine renal functional markers, and after sacrifice at 6 months changes in renal morphology were explored. Tissue damage was estimated by quantifying the relative area of the different subunits in the renal cortex using point counting. Additional morphological signs of radiation damage were also noted. The absorbed doses to the kidneys were estimated by previously determined kidney pharmacokinetics and Monte Carlo simulations for different assumptions regarding the activity distribution.RESULTS: Increased serum creatinine and urea values indicated long-term renal toxicity. The tissue area occupied by proximal tubules decreased with increasing doses of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE, whereas the other subunits in cortex slightly increased. The mean absorbed dose in the renal cortex for [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE was estimated to be 35-58 Gy for the different groups of animals. A dose-response relationship was observed for proximal tubular damage, and a threshold dose value of 24 Gy (BED 37 Gy) was determined.CONCLUSIONS: Selective morphological changes in kidney cortex of nude mice were quantified and appeared in a dose dependent manner after injection of high amounts of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE.",Included,0.11641518
4132,"A case of multi-organ langerhans cell histiocytosis responsive to tobacco cessation Background Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) may present with single or multi-organ involvement (lung, bone, pituitary gland, skin, lymph). Pulmonary LCH is nearly always associated with smoking and lesions may regress with tobacco cessation, which is considered the initial focus of therapy. Multi-organ LCH is thought to be more aggressive and treatment frequently requires systemic chemotherapy, radiation, or combination therapy. The following case illustrates a patient with multi-organ LCH presenting as a pathologic fracture, and describes simultaneous regression of both lung and bone lesions coinciding with tobacco cessation. Case A 32 year-old female with longstanding tobacco abuse, extensive tuberculosis exposure, prior residence in the California high desert, and family history of BRCA mutation presented following a low-impact fall with T4 vertebral pathologic fracture on MRI. She reported subjective fevers, dyspnea on exertion, and intermittent chest pain for two months prior. Exam was notable for tenderness to palpation over T4 and a papular facial rash. Basic laboratory evaluation was normal, but CT chest/abdomen/pelvis showed: innumerable subcentimeter middle/upper lobe-predominant pulmonary nodules, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, ovary with two centimeter cystic structure, and the lytic T4 lesion. Broad differential diagnosis included malignancy, tuberculosis, disseminated fungal disease, and granulomatous disease. Technetium bone scan only revealed the isolated vertebral lesion. PPD and AFB blood cultures were negative. Lumbar puncture and breast/brain MRIs were unrevealing. Coccidiomycosis antibodies, tumor markers, ANA, HIV, hepatitis serologies, SPEP/UPEP, serum quantitative immunoglobulins, and ACE levels were all unremarkable. T4 lesion biopsy was initially thought risky due to aorta proximity, thus bronchoscopy was performed; lavage and transbronchial biopsies were non-diagnostic. Ensuing VATS biopsy specimen revealed bronchiole histiocyte aggregates, eosinophils, and positive CD1a/S100 stains (pulmonary langerhans cell histiocytosis). While follow-up outpatient vertebral biopsy did not confirm LCH bony involvement, disseminated LCH was assumed given her pathologic fracture. Radiation of the vertebral lesion was considered, but deferred when tobacco cessation over 1.5 years led to near-resolution of pulmonary nodules, regression of vertebral lesion, and diminished symptoms. The patient then began smoking again with subsequent recurrent pulmonary involvement, and a new humeral fracture with biopsy-proven LCH of the bone. Discussion This unique case of LCH demonstrates remission and relapse of multi-organ involvement, correlating temporally with cessation of and subsequent return to tobacco use. This is interesting given that unlike isolated pulmonary disease, the causative role of tobacco and response to smoking avoidance have not been previously described for multi-organ LCH.",Excluded,0.08611999

Therefore, we evaluated the impact of this technology on carotid artery stenting (CAS).METHODS: We identified consecutive CAS procedures from 2009 to 2017 and compared those performed with and without 3D image fusion. For image fusion, we created a 3D reconstruction of the aortic arch anatomy based on preoperative computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography that we merged with two-dimensional fluoroscopy, allowing 3D image overlay. We compared radiation exposure, fluoroscopy time, contrast agent dose, time to common carotid artery (CCA) cannulation, time from CCA cannulation to completion angiography, and total procedure time in procedures with and without image fusion. We also assessed rates of 30-day stroke/death, in-hospital and 30-day stroke, and acute kidney injury. We used multivariable linear regression to adjust for patient and procedural characteristics and used these models to compute the marginal effects of image fusion compared with no image fusion.RESULTS: There were 46 patients who underwent CAS with a 3D image fusion system and 70 patients without. Patients undergoing CAS with image fusion experienced 31% lower radiation exposure compared with the control group (207 +/- 23 mGy vs 300 +/- 26 mGy, respectively; P < .01), shorter fluoroscopy time (21 +/- 6 minutes vs 24 +/- 8 minutes; P = .02), shorter time to carotid cannulation (21 +/- 9 minutes vs 31 +/- 8 minutes; P < .001), and shorter total procedure time (47 +/- 13 minutes vs 54 +/- 18 minutes; P = .03). There was no difference in contrast material volume, time from CCA cannulation to completion angiography, or total in-room time. After multivariable adjustment, 3D image fusion remained associated with lower radiation dose, shorter fluoroscopy time, and shorter time to carotid cannulation (all P < .05). The rate of 30-day stroke/death was 2.7% (three strokes and no deaths at 30 days), and the rate of acute kidney injury was 1.8%.CONCLUSIONS: CAS with 3D image fusion was associated with lower radiation exposure and shorter time to CCA cannulation.

Gross anatomical illustrations have shown that the psoas muscle lies lateral to the L4-5 vertebrae and subsequently thins and dissociates from the vertebral body at L5-S1 in a ventrolateral course. A ""rising psoas"" may influence the location of the lumbar plexus and result in transient neurological injury on lateral approach to the spine. It is postulated that axial back pain may be exacerbated by anatomical changes of paraspinal musculature as a direct result of degenerative spine conditions. To their knowledge, the authors present the first reported case of a more anteriorly positioned psoas muscle and its resolution following correction of spondylolisthesis in a 62-year-old woman. This case highlights the dynamic nature of degenerative spinal disorders and illustrates that psoas muscle position can be affected by sagittal balance.

4137,"Predicting image registration quality from the shape of the similarity metric: Potential for machine learning approaches Purpose: Typically, image guided radiotherapy relies on rigid body (RB) image registration (IR) between a reference and localisation image. Automated IR algorithms based on iterative optimisation of a similarity metric (SM) between two images are used extensively and improve the efficiency and accuracy of this process. Occasionally these algorithms do not locate the global optimum of the SM which, if undetected, could lead to a geometric treatment error. This feasibility study uses machine learning to predict the likelihood that the location of the 'found' optimum was acceptably close to the global optimum based on measures of the SM hyper-surface. Materials: Three CBCT images and their reference CT image for each of six patients previously treated with intra-cranial radiotherapy were chosen for this study. The global optimum RB transform for each image pair was located by applying random misalignments before IR and calculating the average rigid body transform returned by the algorithm. A measure of target registration error (TRE) was calculated for each registration from the residual RB transform. IRs were classified as 'Good' (TRE < 0.6mm), 'OK' (0.6<TRE<2.5mm) or 'Poor' (TRE>2.5mm). The correlation ratio SM was calculated along the six cardinal axis of the RB transform space at intervals of 0.2mm. The shape of the SM was characterised by seven different measures describing minimum SM, accuracy and distinctiveness of optimum. These measures were used to train and test a Bayesian Network using K-fold cross validation.

To reduce the computation time, the machine learning process was repeated using just 25 points; the 'found' optimum and two points either siDe of the location of the 'found' optimum on the six cardinal axes of the RB transform. Result(s): No single characteristic of the SM curves correlated well with TRE. However, the Bayesian Network was able to correctly classify 84% of IRs based on the detailed similarity metric profiles. No 'Poor' IRs were classified as 'Good' and vice-versa. Almost identical results were achieved with the 25 point measures but one out of 449 IRs were classified as 'Good' when actually 'Poor'. Conclusion(s): This demonstrates the potential for machine learning based on the local shape of the SM hyper-surface to check likelihood of IR accuracy using only a few calculations of the SM. Such methods could be used to reassure radiation technologists when auto-IR is successful and indicate when closer scrutiny and manual adjustment of image alignment is required.",Excluded,0.08622422

Tumor-targeted therapies using radiolabeled octreotide and meta-iodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) represent a novel treatment approach. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of <sup>131</sup>I-mIBG in the treatment of metastatic midgut carcinoid tumors, survival outcomes were assessed for patients treated at two regional cancer centers and then compared. One center used <sup>131</sup>I-mIBG routinely in the management of metastatic carcinoid tumors (center A), and the other did not use this modality (center B). Only patients with histologically proven metastatic carcinoid tumor shown, or thought most likely, to be of midgut origin were included in the study. During the period 1980 to 2002, a series of 58 patients from center A with metastatic carcinoid tumor arising from the midgut underwent multimodality therapy with the addition of <sup>131</sup>I- mIBG. Their median age was 64 years. The median dose of <sup>131</sup>I-mIBG administered was 6751 MBq, and there was an average of 2.8 treatments per patient. During the same period, 58 patients with metastatic carcinoid were treated at center B with similar multimodality therapy without the use of <sup>131</sup>I-mIBG therapy. Their median age was 65 years. Survivals at 3 and 5 years were 77% and 63%, respectively (95% CI 47-75), for group A.

It is not known yet if these changes of MRI diffusion parameters were specific for migraine, or related to the repeated pain attacks. Method(s): 11 patients with cluster headache and 11 agematched healthy control subjects were recruited. Diffusion weighted MRI images with 60 diffusion directions were acquired on a 1.5 T GE Signa Excite scanner. Tract based spatial statistics were used to detect the integrity of white matter tracts in a skeleton representing the core of the fibre bundles. Result(s): Reduced fractional anisotropy was found in a right corticospinal tract, in the corpus callosum and in the anterior thalamic radiation bilaterally. The axial diffusivity was bilaterally increased in the anterior thalamic radiation, in the anterior corona radiate and in the inferior part of the fronto-occipital fasciculus. The mean and perpendicular diffusivity was increased almost over the whole brain with left sided dominance.

Method(s): Table 1 lists our experimental production rates for [<sup>51</sup>Mn] and [<sup>52</sup>Mn]. To optimize the production rate of [<sup>51</sup>Mn], gold target plates were electroplated with a thin layer (5 mg, 2.8mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) of Cr-50 metal and irradiated with 14 MeV deuterons as an internal slant target in the CS30 cyclotron [1]. [<sup>52</sup>Mn] was obtained after irradiation of a cup target of vanadium metal [2]. The nuclear reaction <sup>52</sup>Cr(d, n)<sup>52</sup>Mn using a slant target yielded [<sup>52</sup>Mn] (0.05 mCi/muA-h) but was contaminated with >4% [54Mn] as shown in Table 1. A semi-remote apparatus was employed to prepare sterile solutions of [<sup>51</sup>Mn] in 1M bicine, after oxidation of chromium target material and separation on a silica column [1]. The simple extraction method of Sastri [2] was used to prepare bicine solutions [<sup>52</sup>Mn] for research studies. After isolation of radionuclides, a dose calibrator setting was determined and cross-referenced with gamma ray spectral analysis. Presence of carrier manganese was determined by spot tests using SenSafe Manganese Check strips (<0.1 ppm) and validated by ion chromatography.

4145,"Irradiation and hypoxia promote homing of haematopoietic progenitor cells towards gliomas by TGF-beta-dependent HIF-1alpha-mediated induction of CXCL12 Previously we defined a pathway of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and stromal cell-derived factor-1/CXC chemokine ligand 12 (SDF-1alpha/CXCL12) dependent migration of adult haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPC) towards glioma cells in vitro and their homing to experimental gliomas in vivo. Hypoxia is a critical aspect of the microenvironment of gliomas and irradiation is an essential part of the standard therapy. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of HPC as vectors for a cell-based therapy of gliomas, we investigated the impact of hypoxia and irradiation on the attraction of HPC by glioma cells. Temozolomide (TMZ) treatment and hyperthermia served as controls. Supernatants of irradiated or hypoxic LNT-229 glioma cells promote HPC migration in vitro. Reporter assays reveal that the CXCL12 promoter activity is enhanced in LNT-229 cells at 24 h after irradiation at 8 Gy or after exposure to 1% oxygen for 12 h. The irradiation- and hypoxia-induced release of CXCL12 depends on hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha), but not on p53. Induction of transcriptional activity of HIF-1alpha by hypoxia or irradiation requires an intact TGF-beta signalling cascade. This delineates a novel stress signalling cascade in glioma cells involving TGF-beta, HIF-1alpha and CXCL12. Stress stimuli can be irradiation, hypoxia or TMZ, but not hyperthermia. Cerebral irradiation of nude mice at 21 days after intracerebral implantation of LNT-229 glioma induces tumour satellite formation and enhances the glioma tropism of HPC to the tumour bulk and even to these satellites in vivo. These data suggest that the use of HPC as cellular vectors in the treatment of glioblastoma may well be combined with irradiation or other anti-angiogenic therapies that induce tumour hypoxia.",Excluded,0.086507164
4146,"Unilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation has a measurable ipsilateral effect on rigidity and bradykinesia in Parkinson disease BACKGROUND: Bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) improves motor function in Parkinson disease (PD). However, little is known about the quantitative effects on motor behavior of unilateral STN DBS.METHODS: In 52 PD subjects with STN DBS, we quantified in a double-blinded manner rigidity (n=42), bradykinesia (n=38), and gait speed (n=45). Subjects were tested in four DBS conditions: both on, left on, right on and both off. A force transducer was used to measure rigidity across the elbow, and gyroscopes were used to measure angular velocity of hand rotations for bradykinesia. About half of the subjects were rated using the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (part III) motor scores for arm rigidity and repetitive hand rotation simultaneously during the kinematic measurements. Subjects were timed walking 25 feet.RESULTS: All subjects had significant improvement with bilateral STN DBS. Contralateral, ipsilateral and bilateral stimulation significantly reduced rigidity and bradykinesia. Bilateral stimulation improved rigidity more than unilateral stimulation of either side, but there was no significant difference between ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation. Although bilateral stimulation also increased hand rotation velocity more than unilateral stimulation of either side, contralateral stimulation increased hand rotation significantly more than ipsilateral stimulation. All stimulation conditions improved walking time but bilateral stimulation provided the greatest improvement.CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral STN DBS decreased rigidity and bradykinesia contralaterally as well ipsilaterally. As expected, bilateral DBS improved gait more than unilateral DBS.",Excluded,0.08611282

4148,"Diffusion tensor imaging of OEF/OIF veterans with and without exposure to primary blast forces Background: History of exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in post-deployment veterans. White-matter (WM) effects of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) from blast exposure with other injuries have been documented. Primary blast exposure without secondary injuries or clinical symptoms at the time has not been studied. Objective(s): Residual effects on neuroimaging metrics of exposure to primary blast insufficient to meet criteria formild TBI were assessed. Method(s): Post-deployment veterans without mTBI, with (n=20) and without (n=18) primary blast exposure were assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). WM-specific registration followed by whole-brain voxel-wise analysis of fractional anisotropic (FA) diffusion was conducted in all subjects. Result(s): Loss of WM integrity in primary fibers (p,0.05; corrected) was associated with blast-exposed veterans who did not meet criteria for mTBI when compared with nonblast- exposed veterans in a widely distributed pattern of major fiber bundles and smaller peripheral tracts, including the forceps major, superior longitudinal fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiations, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and the corticospinal tract. Conclusion(s): Diffuse WM changes were found in veterans with a history of exposure to primary blast forces that, based on self-report of symptoms, was not sufficient to cause mTBI. These results may indicate that primary blast forces are able to trigger injury processes in the brain without causing clear alteration in consciousness. Alternatively, WM integrity may have been affected by other mechanisms.",Excluded,0.48555246
4149,"Genetic and physiological regulation of non-homologous end-joining in mammalian cells Repair of DSBs is important to prevent chromosomal fragmentation, translocations and deletions. To investigate the process in NHEJ, we have established an in vitro system to clarify the measurement and analysis of the efficiency and the fidelity of rejoining of DSBs, and applied the method to investigate NHEJ in human cells derived from patients suffering from cancer-prone hereditary diseases. A DSB was introduced in plasmid pZErO-2 at a specific site within the ccdB gene that is lethal to E. coli cells, and treated with nuclear extracts from human cells. The efficiency of rejoining in the nuclear extract from an A-T cell line was comparable to that from a control cell line. However, the accuracy of rejoining was much lower for the A-T cell extract than for the control cell extract. All mutations were deletions, most of which contained short direct repeats at the breakpoint junctions. The deletion spectrum caused by the A-T nuclear extract was distinct from that by the control extract. These results indicate that A-T cells have certain deficiencies in end-joining of double-strand breaks in DNA. The extract from BS cells also showed the similar activity and the lower fidelity of rejoing compared to that from normal cells. From the sequencing analysis of the junction of DSBs, it is speculated that the defect in the BLM helicase might cause irregular rejoining of DSBs. Radioadaptive response is the acquirement of cellular resistance to ionizing radiation by prior exposure to low dose. We investigated the in vitro end-joining activity of DNA ends in radioadaptive cells. Both the efficiency and the fidelity of rejoining in the cells pre-exposed to low dose are increased comparing to those without pre-exposure. We also investigated the joining activity of DNA ends in p53-deficient cells. Pre-irradiation caused no apparent alteration in both the efficiency and fidelity of end-joining. These results suggest that the exposure to low dose activates a cellular function to repair DSBs efficiently, which is dependent on p53. These results indicate that NHEJ pathway is regulated by many factors; genetic regulation by ATM and BLM, and physiological conditions such as irradiation with ionizing radiation. The observations also suggest that in some occasions p53 might play a key role in NHEJ. [References: 103]",Excluded,0.08809758

We examined the effect of early treatment of high-dose dexamethasone on iridium-192-induced damage to normal brain tissue.METHODS: Brain damage induced by interstitial irradiation with iridium-192 was evaluated with sequential magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 11 adult monkeys, with or without short-term high-dose dexamethasone treatment. Dexamethasone (1 mg/kg of body weight/d) was administered intramuscularly to five irradiated animals every 24 hours, beginning 2 days before and ending 7 days after irradiation. Magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after irradiation.RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging performed 1 week after irradiation revealed marked edema in five nontreated animals. In dexamethasone-treated animals, the volume of edema was reduced significantly, compared to that of nontreated animals, 1 week and 1 month after irradiation. The volume of ring enhancement in dexamethasone-treated animals was also reduced significantly, compared to that of nontreated animals, 3 months after the irradiation. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy spectra revealed that N-acetylaspartate and choline peaks were reduced 1 week after irradiation in both groups. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups at any time points.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that dexamethasone treatment may have an antiedema effect at an early stage and may modify subsequent development of vascular and inflammatory changes but may have no effect of preventing radiation-induced necrosis and the reduction of N-acetylaspartate after brachytherapy.",Included,0.98421496

Apoptosis was quantified using morphology and end-labeling immunohistochemistry, and cell proliferation was detected using antibodies against the thymidine analog BrdU and the cyclin-dependent kinase p34(cdc2). Radiation-induced apoptosis occurred rapidly, with maximum morphological and end-labeling changes observed 3-6h after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation cell proliferation was significantly reduced relative to sham-irradiated controls. The number of apoptotic nuclei increased rapidly with radiation dose, reaching a plateau at about 3Gy. The maximum number of apoptotic nuclei was substantially higher than the number of proliferating cells, suggesting that non-proliferating as well as proliferating cells in the subgranular zone were sensitive to irradiation. Subgranular zone cell proliferation was significantly reduced relative to age-matched controls 120 days after doses of 5Gy or higher. These findings suggest that neural precursor cells of the dentate gyrus are very sensitive to irradiation and are not capable of repopulating the subgranular zone at least up to 120 days after irradiation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of RF-EMR on the brain mechanism of rats by recording local field potentials (LFPs) signals during working memory (WM) task. Subjects were exposed to 900 MHz from a dipole antenna daily for three hours. Exposure was applied, first on a short term base (1 week) and then on a long term base (4 weeks). Behavioral parameters were measured weekly while rats performed T-maze tasks in two types of normal and delayed. LFPs signals were simultaneously recorded by implanted microelectrode arrays on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats. Results showed a significant increase (*p < 0.05) in the task completion time of exposed rats which vanished shortly after the end of short term RF-EMR exposure. Before exposure, during correctly performed delayed tasks, an increase (peak) in power changes of theta band (4-12 Hz) was observed. But during correctly performed normal tasks, an increase appeared only by applying RF-EMR exposure. The similarity in power changes pattern of theta band in both types of tasks was observed after long term exposure. Classification accuracy of LFPs in truly done normal and delayed tasks was compared in pre and post-exposure states. Initial classification accuracy was 84.2 % which decreased significantly (*P < 0.05) after exposure.

4156,"Mechanisms of caspase-1 mediated schwannoma regression Schwannoma tumors are composed of Schwann-lineage cells and form along peripheral, spinal and cranial nerves. These tumors can cause pain, sensory/motor dysfunction, and death through compression of peripheral nerves, the spinal cord, and/or the brain stem. We have previously shown gene therapy for these tumors using a xenograft model in which immortalized human schwannoma cells (HEI-193) expressing a fluorescent protein and luciferase are implanted in the sciatic nerve of nude mice. Our strategy has been to express the apoptotic protein, caspase-1 (ICE, IL1-converting enzyme) under the P0 promoter, selectively active in Schwann cells during development, using an adeno-associated vector 1 (AAV1) injected directly into the tumors. Caspase-3 is the most common pro-apoptotic target for therapeutic modulation. However, unlike caspase-3, caspase-1 has a strong pro-inflammatory component in addition to induction of apoptosis. Caspase-1 activates pro-IL-1b and pro-IL-18, which in turn trigger immune responses mediated by neutrophils and monocytes, or NK cells; it has been associated with both innate and adaptive immunity. In addition, caspase-1 is activated by several chemotherapeutic drugs and can sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation. Our recent data indicate that AAV1- P0-ICE not only induces apoptosis of infected caspase-1-expressing HEI-193 schwannoma cells, but also kills non-infected tumor cells through a bystander effect mediated by both tumor- and host-specific mechanisms. Supernatants derived from HEI-193 cells transfected with AAV1-P0-ICE DNA kill non-transfected tumor cells in vitro. Similarly, peripheral nerve implantation of a 1:1 mixture of AAV-P0- ICE DNA-transfected and non-transfected HEI-193 cells prevented tumor growth. This bystander killing effect induced by AAV1-P0-ICE was also observed when established intra-sciatic HEI-193 tumors were injected with AAV1-P0-ICE transfected cells. Interestingly, intra-sciatic implantation of HEI-193 cells 2 weeks after injection at the same location of AAV1-P0-ICE DNA-transfected cells, i.e. long after all of the originally implanted caspase-1expressing HEI-193 cells should be dead, also prevents formation of a tumor. These data suggest that caspase-1-induced death of HEI-193 cells in vivo leads to local changes in the region of the tumor capable of preventing formation of a subsequent tumor. This investigation of AAV1-P0-ICE induced bystander killing of tumor cells has the potential to generate new therapeutics for the neurofibromatoses, as well as, for other benign neoplasms. Not only can caspase-1 induce apoptosis, but the resulting tumor killing and associated activation of host immune responses may generate a vaccination effect that could control the development and growth of subsequent schwannomas.",Excluded,0.085861094

The objectives of the study was to determine the prevalence of radiation-induced extracranial carotid stenosis, plaque, carotid intima thickness (CIMT) in NPC patients; to explore whether the stenosis is due to direct effect of radiation rather than general tendency to atherosclerosis. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the University Malaya Medical Centre from July 2011 to February 2012. The study subjects consisted of 47 NPC patients who were treated with radiation, and 47 healthy control. The patients and control had carotid duplex ultrasound and transcranial Doppler (TCD). Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 55.1 years, the time lapse from radiation was 76.7 +/- 95.3 months. Internal carotid artery (ICA) and common carotid artery (CCA) stenosis of >=50% was seen in 17.0% of patients vs 2.1 % of controls (p = 0.031), with 61.7% of patients and 19.1% of controls having plaque in ICA and CCA (p=0.004). CIMT was increased in 70.2% of patients and 44.7% of controls (p =0.022). Both the patient group and control had similar rate of intracranial stenosis of 12.8% in TCD.

This study included participants in the Radiation Effects Research Foundation Adult Health Study who have been followed up by biennial health examinations since 1958. We calculated the LTR of stroke for various BP-based groups among 7847 subjects who had not been diagnosed with stroke before the index age of 55 years using cumulative incidence analysis adjusting for competing risks. By 2003, 868 subjects had suffered stroke (512 (58.9%) were women and 542 (62.4%) experienced ischemic stroke). BP was a significant factor in determining risk of stroke for men and women, with distributions of cumulative risk for stroke significantly different across BP groups. The LTR of all-stroke for normotension (systolic BP/diastolic BP < 120/80 mm Hg), prehypertension (120-139/80-89 mm Hg), stage 1 hypertension (140-159/90-99 mm Hg) and stage 2 hypertension (> 160/100 mm Hg) were 13.8-16.9-25.8-25.8% in men and 16.0-19.9-24.0-30.5% in women, respectively (P < 0.001 among BP groups in both sexes).

Ndrg2 is a member of the N-Myc downstream-regulated genes. Interestingly, repeated ECT also significantly decreased Ndrg2 expression in this region of the brain. These data suggest that Ndrg2 may be a common functional molecule that is decreased after antidepressant treatment and ECT. Although, the functional role of Ndrg2 in the central nervous system remains unclear, our findings suggest that Ndrg2 may be associated with treatment-induced adaptive neural plasticity in the brain, a chronic target of antidepressant action. In conclusion, we have identified Ndrg2 as a candidate target molecule of antidepressants and ECT.",Excluded,0.08592781
4163,"Evaluation of QOL and psychological response in patients treated with palliative radiotherapy Purpose or Objective Usually, evaluation of palliative radiotherapy is made by physical findings or levels of pain relief. But little is known about patient quality of life (QOL), psychophysiological response, and assessment of adverse effect from the view point of QOL. We evaluated the effects of palliative radiotherapy for cancer recurrence or metastasis on patient QOL and psychophysiology. Material and Methods A total of 67 patients who received palliative radiotherapy between 2014 and 2015 were enrolled. Patient diseases were bone metastasis in 51 patients, lymph node metastasis in 7 patients, brain metastasis in 2 patients, local recurrence in 3 patients, and the others in 4 patients. Median irradiated dose was 30 Gy in 10 fractions for palliative radiotherapy. We used the questionnaires EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-C15-PAL to evaluate patient QOL and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate patient mental healthcare at the start and at the end of radiotherapy. Results As compared to scores at the start of radiotherapy, at the end of radiotherapy, numerical rating scale (NRS) and face scale significantly decreased. On the other hand, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) did not show no changes during palliative radiotherapy. In functional scales, average scores of role functioning (RF2) and emotional functioning (EF) also improved. In symptom scales, average scores of fatigue (FA), pain (PA), and insomnia (SL) improved. In bone metastasis group, global health status / QOL (QL2), PA, and SL significantly improved. After palliative radiotherapy, anxiety score of HADS was elevated below age of 70 years. There was relationship between anxiety improvement and QOL improvement after palliative radiotherapy. Nausea and vomiting scores of EORTC-QLQC15- PAL were associated with the irradiated volume of palliative radiotherapy for pelvic region. Conclusion Patient QOL of was improved by palliative radiotherapy regardless of PS. The possibility of palliative radiotherapy having a positive influence on patient psychophysiology was also suggested in younger age.",Excluded,0.8999685

4165,"Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) radioligand [18F]FEDAA1106: a human whole-body PET study PURPOSE: [(18)F]FEDAA1106 is a recently developed positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for in vivo quantification of the 18 kDa translocator protein [TSPO or, as earlier called, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)]. TSPO imaging is expected to be useful for the clinical evaluation of neuroinflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to provide dosimetry estimates for [(18)F]FEDAA1106 based on human whole-body PET measurements.METHODS: PET scans were performed for a total of 6.6 h after the injection of 183.8 +/- 9.1 MBq of [(18)F]FEDAA1106 in six healthy subjects. Regions of interest were drawn on coronal images. Estimates of the absorbed doses of radiation were calculated using the OLINDA software.RESULTS: Peak uptake was largest in lungs, followed by liver, small intestine, kidney, spleen and other organs. Peak values of the percent injected dose (%ID) at a time after radioligand injection were calculated for the lungs (27.1%ID at 0.2 h), liver (21.1%ID at 0.6 h), small intestine (10.4%ID at 6.3 h), kidney (4.9%ID at 1.8 h) and spleen (4.6%ID at 0.6 h). The largest absorbed dose was found in the spleen (0.12 mSv/MBq), followed by kidneys (0.094 mSv/MBq). The calculated mean effective dose was 0.036 mSv/MBq.CONCLUSION: Based on the distribution and dose estimates, the estimated radiation burden of [(18)F]FEDAA1106 is moderately higher than that of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). In clinical studies, the administered activity of this radioligand ought to be adjusted in line with regional regulations.

4167,"Evaluation of novel modified tangential irradiation technique for breast cancer patients using dose-volume histograms Purpose We have previously reported that entire axillary lymph node regions could be irradiated by the modified tangential irradiation technique (MTIT). In this study, MTIT was compared with a conventional irradiation technique (CTIT) using dose-volume histograms to verify how adequately MTIT covers the breast and axillary lymph node region and the extent to which it involves the lung and heart. Methods and materials Forty-four patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated by lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and postoperative radiotherapy. Twenty-two patients were treated with MTIT and 22 with CTIT. In 25 patients, the breast tumor was on the left and in 19 on the right. During axillary dissection, surgical clips were left as markers at the border of the axillary lymph node region. MTIT was planned by setting the dorsal edge of the radiation field on a lateral-view simulator film at the dorsal edge of the humeral head and the cranial edge of the radiation field at the caudal edge of the humeral head. CTIT was planned to ensure radiation of the breast tissue without considering the axillary region. In this study, all patients underwent computed tomography, and the CT data were transmitted on-line to a radiotherapy planning system, in which the dose-distribution computed tomography images and dose-volume histograms were calculated by defining the breast, axillary region (levels I, II, and III), lung, and heart region. Results Dose-volume histogram analysis demonstrated that breast tissue was radiated with an 86.5-100% volume (median 96.5%) by MTIT and an 83-100% volume (median, 95%) by CTIT at >95% of the isocenter dose. The axillary lymph node regions at Levels I, II, and III were irradiated with 84-100% (median, 94.5%), 59-100% (median, 89%), and 70-100% (median, 89.5%) volumes, respectively, by MTIT and with 2-84% (median, 38%), 0-53% (median, 15%), and 0-31% (median, 0%) volumes, respectively, by CTIT at >70% of the isocenter dose. The ipsilateral lung was irradiated with a 5-22% volume (median, 11.5%) by MTIT and 5-15% volume (median 9%) by CTIT at >90% of the isocenter dose. In all 25 left-sided breast cancer patients, the volumes irradiated with an 80% isocenter dose were <30 cm<sup>3</sup>. Conclusion The results of our study demonstrated that the breast tissue was sufficiently irradiated with both CTIT and MTIT planning, the axillary lymph node areas irradiated by MTIT were much wider than those irradiated by CTIT at all levels, and the lung and heart volumes irradiated by MTIT were small.

The purpose of this study was to use endocrine data from existing publications to characterise the baseline endocrine status, the effects of radiotherapy on the HPA during the first follow-up year and the time dependence of radiation-induced HPA dysfunction in patients treated with radiotherapy for non-pituitary intracranial neoplasms.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search of databases was carried out for articles that reported the results of endocrine testing for patients aged 16 years and older who were treated with neurosurgery for non-pituitary intracranial neoplasms or radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal neoplasms. To analyse the radiotherapy-related changes in hormone levels over time, long-term prospective endocrine data from nasopharyngeal studies were normalised to baseline hormone data and fitted to an exponential decay model. This process was repeated with normalisation to year 1 hormone data.RESULTS: Eight unique articles met eligibility criteria. HPA dysfunction occurred in 21.6-64.7% of patients who were assessed for endocrinopathies following neurosurgery. Studies on the early effects of radiotherapy on nasopharyngeal patients showed statistically significant changes in growth hormone, luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels during the first year of follow-up. Time dependence modelling showed that normalisation to year 1 hormone levels yield exponential equations with stronger measures of goodness of fit.CONCLUSION: HPA dysfunction in patients treated for non-pituitary intracranial neoplasms is probably a result of both neurosurgery and radiotherapy treatments. Although statistically significant endocrine changes can occur during this first year of follow-up, those documented at year 1 may be more predictive of subsequent HPA dysfunction.",Excluded,0.9526183

This study aimed to clarify the mechanism of acquisition of radioresistance through the control of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by IL-6. We used a rat glioma cell line (C6) as tumor cells and a rat astrocyte cell line (RNB) as non-tumor cells. Our results showed that the surviving fraction of C6 cells after 6 Gy irradiation was increased by the addition of IL-6, but that this was not the case in RNB cells. In addition, the number of 53BP1 foci in C6 cells at 30 min after gamma-irradiation were decreased by IL-6. Levels of ROS in whole C6 cells, and superoxide in the mitochondria of C6 cells immediately after gamma-irradiation, were reduced by IL-6, but this was not observed in RNB cells. The mitochondrial membrane potential detected by JC-1 in C6 and RNB cells was inhibited by IL-6 alone. Therefore, it was concluded that IL-6 leads specifically to radioresistance in tumor cells by inhibition of increases in ROS after gamma-irradiation.",Included,0.90979534
4173,"Collateral damage of radiation to normal tissues: What can the retina tell us? Purpose : Damage to normal tissue in an irradiated field (normal tissue injury, NTI) is a complication of radiation therapy believed to be caused by microvessel pathology. In the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS), vascular pathology was described in uveal melanoma (UM) patients 2 years post-radiation therapy. However, the COMS and other studies used subjective scoring systems, lacked a control group, did not assess neuronal function in detail, and used dosimetry methods simplified for clinical application. Methods : Optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCT-A) was used to characterize vascular pathology by vessel density, fractal dimension (FD), lacunarity, foveal avascular zone (FAZ) size, parafoveal density (PVD), and by machine learning-derived density maps. OCT-derived retinal layer thickness and 10-2 visual field testing (VF) were used to quantify corresponding neuronal loss and dysfunction. Patient-specific 3D dosimetry models were constructed to spatially correlate dose to each outcome measure. Measurements were taken in both eyes of 31 UM patients at 0.5-150 mo post-<sup>125</sup>I plaque brachytherapy, and 16 age-matched controls. Data were normalized to the contralateral eye to account for subject variation due to age or systemic disease. Results : Abnormal vessel density, FD, lacunarity, FAZ size, and PVD were observed after 24 mo in 25 out of 31 subjects, whereas only 6 subjects showed any vascular pathology before 24 mo. Visual acuity was the least sensitive indicator of adverse outcome, with only 16% of the entire population showing a visual decline of two or more Snellen lines since diagnosis. Neuronal dysfunction by VF correlated strongly with most measures, especially vessel density, thinning of the superficial retina, and radiation dose (p<0.001). Abnormalities were observed only at doses above 20 Gy. Conclusions : Using a series of quantitative approaches, radiation microvasculopathy was detected starting at 24 mo post-exposure in most patients. Strong correlations between loss of neuronal function, vascular pathology, and dose were observed. Prospective studies will help determine whether vascular pathology precedes neuronal loss.",Included,0.97386885

We observed that voltage-dependent ion channels contributed in several ways to the response to tones. A sustained response to long tones was observed only in cells showing little accommodation during current injection. Cells showing burst-onset firing during current injection showed a small response to SAM tones, whereas burst-sustained cells showed a good response to SAM tones. The hyperpolarization-activated nonselective cation channel I(h) had a special role in shaping the responses: I(h) was associated with an increased excitability, with chopper and pauser responses, and with an afterhyperpolarization following tones. Synaptic properties were more important in determining the responses to tones of different durations. A short-latency inhibitory response appeared to contribute to the long-pass response in some cells and short-pass and band-pass neurons were characterized by their slow recovery from synaptic adaptation. Cells that recovered slowly from synaptic adaptation showed a relatively small response to SAM tones. Our results show an important role for both intrinsic membrane properties -- most notably the presence of I(h) and the extent of accommodation -- and synaptic adaptation in shaping the response to tones in the inferior colliculus.",Excluded,0.08851621

4179,"Rhythmicity of triiodothyronine generation by type II thyroxine 5'-deiodinase in rat pineal is mediated by a beta-adrenergic mechanism Type II T4 5'-deiodinase plays an essential role in converting T4 to T3 in extrathyroidal tissues, thus allowing the full development of a cellular effect of thyroid hormone. This enzyme is one of the most important factors in regulating local action of thyroid hormone. Its activity in the rat pineal was 20-30 times higher at midnight than at noon; this nocturnal rise was abolished by the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol. The beta-agonist isoproterenol, caused a 3-fold increase in diurnal enzyme activity. There is thus a marked nyctohemeral variation in T4 activation in the pineal, probably mediated by a beta-adrenergic mechanism. Since the temporal peak of pineal T4 activation corresponds to that of pineal function, our data suggest a previously unrecognized role of thyroid hormone in pineal regulation.",Excluded,0.08624434

This stimulation was also used as conditioning one when proceeded peripheral stimuli. To analyze the nonspecific specific interactions upon single neurons conditioning photic stimuli were applied. The results show that T-C neurons are antidromically excited from a wide cortical areas and that the functional interaction between T-C neurons is mediated by a shared input from common sources.

The molecular mechanisms underpinning muscle atrophy and decreased performance have been studied mostly after short duration flights and are still not fully elucidated. By deciphering the muscle proteome changes elicited in mice after a full month aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite, we observed that the antigravity soleus incurred the greatest changes compared with locomotor muscles. Proteomics data notably suggested mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic and fiber type switching toward glycolytic type II fibers, structural alterations, and calcium signaling-related defects to be the main causes for decreased muscle performance in flown mice. Alterations of the protein balance, mTOR pathway, myogenesis, and apoptosis were expected to contribute to muscle atrophy. Moreover, several signs reflecting alteration of telomere maintenance, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance were found as possible additional deleterious effects. Finally, 8 days of recovery post flight were not sufficient to restore completely flight-induced changes. Thus in-depth proteomics analysis unraveled the complex and multifactorial remodeling of skeletal muscle structure and function during long-term space flight, which should help define combined sets of countermeasures before, during, and after the flight.",Included,0.8877041

At low field intensities, the predominant effect on the electrically evoked field potential in CA1 was a potentiation of the amplitude of the population spike by up to 20%, but higher intensity fields could produce either increases or decreases of up to 120 and 80%, respectively, in the amplitude of the population spike. To eliminate the possibility of RF-induced artefacts due to the metal stimulating electrode, the effect of RF exposure on spontaneous epileptiform activity induced in CA3 by 4-aminopyridine (50-100 microM) was investigated. Exposure to RF fields (50.0 V m(-1)) reduced or abolished epileptiform bursting in 36% of slices tested. The maximum field intensity used in these experiments, 71.0 V m(-1), was calculated to produce a specific absorption rate (SAR) of between 0.0016 and 0.0044 W kg(-1) in the slices. Measurements with a Luxtron fibreoptic probe confirmed that there was no detectable temperature change (+/- 0.1 degrees C) during a 15 min exposure to this field intensity. Furthermore, imposed temperature changes of up to 1 degrees C failed to mimic the effects of RF exposure.

For example, a non-astronaut can imagine being on a rocket ship traveling to the moon based on a variety of life experiences. We sought to characterize the brain activity that occurs when one imagines severe catastrophic pain beyond anything ever actually experienced. Our specific goal is to test whether past experience with or without chronic pain is reflected in the brain systems of pain imagery. We completed preliminary analysis on 14 healthy volunteers, 25 individuals with chronic low back pain, and 12 individuals who have recovered from an acute episode of low back pain. During block-design fMRI scanning, participants were instructed to imagine severe catastrophic pain involving bone-crushing injuries while their entire body is on fire. In our preliminary analysis, all groups had prefrontal activity during task performance. Comparing across all three groups, there was relatively little brain activity in individuals who had recovered from low back pain. There was a moderate amount of brain activity for healthy individuals, in a reasonably distributed pattern throughout the brain. There was a large amount of brain activity for individuals with current low back pain, including significant activity of bilateral anterior insula. These preliminary results suggest that experience with pain can be reflected in the imagery of catastrophic pain. The difference between individuals who have experienced recovery versus persistence of pain is particularly striking, and this difference may provide insight into mechanisms with additional data and analysis.",Excluded,0.087793514
4192,"In vivo evaluation of 18F-MNI698: an 18F-labeled radiotracer for imaging of serotonin 4 receptors in brain UNLABELLED: Serotonin 4 receptors (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 [5HT4R]) hold promise as a novel therapeutic approach to multiple brain disorders, including Alzheimer and Huntington disease. In vivo imaging of these receptors with selective 5HT4R radiotracers and PET would be valuable to investigate alterations in 5HT4R in different brain disorders and to assist drug discovery. In this study, (18)F-MNI698 was evaluated as a potential PET radiotracer for imaging of 5HT4R in the brain.METHODS: Eighteen PET studies were performed in 3 adult rhesus monkeys. The radiotracer was administered as a bolus intravenous injection or bolus plus constant infusion (time that would be required to inject the bolus at the infusion rate = 60 min), and arterial blood was collected for data quantification. Kinetic models were used to estimate distribution volumes and binding potentials, for which the cerebellum was used as a reference region. (18)F-MNI698 test-retest variability and upper mass dose limits were determined. Preblocking studies using several doses of SB204070, a selective 5HT4R antagonist, were performed.RESULTS: (18)F-MNI698 avidly entered the monkey brain (peak percentage injected dose of ~ 6.6%), and its brain distribution was consistent with known 5HT4R densities. At 120 min after bolus injection and after the start of radiotracer infusion, only less than 5% and approximately 10% parent compound was present in blood, respectively. Measured binding potentials were underestimated by 22%-36% when noninvasive methods were used for data quantification in comparison with invasive methods. A good agreement was found between test-retest measurements. The radiotracer upper mass dose limit (<5% occupancy) was determined to be 13.1 mug per 70 kg of body weight. SB204070 blocked the radiotracer binding in a dose-dependent manner.CONCLUSION: Data indicate that (18)F-MNI698 is a promising PET radiotracer for imaging of 5HT4R in the brain, and human studies are warranted based on these study results.",Excluded,0.08594436

4194,"Spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties: implications for elevated cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure Evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and diminished in astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were isolated from 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for in vitro vascular and mechanical testing. Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were lower and vascular distensibility greater in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice (n=7) relative to ground-based control group (GC) mice (n=12). Basilar artery maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236+/-9 mum and GC: 215+/-5 mum) with no difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4+/-1.6 mum; GC: 12.2+/-1.2 mum). Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized via nanoindentation, was lower in SF mice (SF: 3.4+/-0.3 N/m; GC: 5.4+/-0.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of perfusion could contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an associated impairment of visual acuity in astronauts during spaceflight.",Included,0.95764256
4195,"Differences in the DNA supercoiling response of irradiated cell lines from ataxia-telangiectasia versus unaffected individuals In this study the manifestation of DNA damage at the nucleoid level was examined in several AT cell lines using an image analysis system to directly visualize and measure the changes in DNA loop size which occur when increasing concentrations of propidium iodide (PI) are used to titrate the DNA supercoiling response (the 'fluorescent halo assay'). This response consists of a relaxation (0.5-7.5 micrograms/ml PI) and rewinding phase (10-50 micrograms/ml PI), the latter of which is impaired by the presence of DNA strand breaks in irradiated cells. In addition to the inhibition of DNA rewinding seen immediately after irradiation at 0 degrees C, the supercoiling response of AT diploid fibroblasts indicated an increased amount of DNA unwinding compared to fibroblasts from unaffected individuals. This difference appeared to saturate, since the excess in DNA loop size over that seen in irradiated fibroblasts from unaffected individuals remained constant after 5 Gy. These results may reflect a greater instability of the DNA-nuclear matrix attachment points in irradiated AT fibroblasts. The DNA supercoiling response in irradiated transformed AT fibroblasts and AT lymphoblasts did not differ from that observed in unaffected cells of the same type. However, all of the immortalized cell lines (AT and unaffected) had inherently larger DNA loop sizes than diploid fibroblasts and exhibited excess unwinding after irradiation.",Excluded,0.31677595
4196,"Thymoquinone reduces oxidative and nitrosative stress in tongue-tissue of rats exposed to total cranial irradiation Introduction: Head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy suffer severe side-effects during and following their treatment. Efforts to decrease toxicity of irradiation to normal tissue, organs and cells have led to a search for cytoprotective agent. Investigations for effective and non-toxic compounds with radioprotective capability led to increasing interest in antioxidant such as thymoquinone (TQ). Objective(s): The aim of this study was to evaluate the radioprotective effects of TQ on oxidant/antioxidant systems in the tongue-tissue of rats exposed to total cranial irradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-two rats were divided into four groups to test the radioprotective effectiveness of TQ administered by either orogastric tube or intraperitoneal injection. Appropriate control groups were also studied. Result(s): Tongue glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), total superoxide scavenger activity (TSSA), non-enzymatic superoxide scavenger activity (NSSA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the control and sham control groups were significantly increased when compared to the irradiation (IR) group and IR plus TQ groups. Nitric oxide (NO*), peroxynitrite (ONOO-) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, xantine oxidase (XO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities significantly increased in the IR group when compared to the control and sham control groups.

4199,"Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): A new promising technology in radiation oncology Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a new technology in radiation oncology that delivers radiation more precisely to the tumor while relatively sparing the surrounding normal tissues. It also introduces new concepts of inverse planning and computer-controlled radiation deposition and normal tissue avoidance in contrast to the conventional trial-and-error approach. IMRT has wide application in most aspects of radiation oncology because of its ability to create multiple targets and multiple avoidance structures, to treat different targets simultaneously to different doses as well as to weight targets and avoidance structures according to their importance. By delivering radiation with greater precision, IMRT has been shown to minimize acute treatment-related morbidity, making dose escalation feasible which may ultimately improve local tumor control. IMRT has also introduced a new accelerated fractionation scheme known as SMART (simultaneous modulated accelerated radiation therapy) boost. By shortening the overall treatment time, SMART boost has the potential of improving tumor control in addition to offering patient convenience and cost savings.",Excluded,0.08702534
4200,"Microstimulation of V1 delays visually guided saccades: a parametric evaluation of delay fields Electrical microstimulation of macaque striate cortex (area V1) delays the execution of saccadic eye movements made to a visual target placed in the receptive field of the stimulated neurons. The region of visual space within which saccades are delayed is called a delay field. We examined the effects of changing the parameters of stimulation and target size on the size of a delay field. Rhesus monkeys were required to generate a saccadic eye movement to a punctate and white visual target presented within or outside the receptive field of the neurons under study. On 50% of trials, a train of stimulation consisting of 0.2-ms anode-first pulses was delivered to the neurons before the onset of the visual target. Stimulations were performed in the operculum at 0.9-2.0 mm below the cortical surface. It was found that increases in current (50-100 microA), pulse frequency (100-300 Hz), or train duration (75-300 ms) increased the size of a delay field and increases in target size (0.1 degrees -0.2 degrees of visual angle) decreased the size of a delay field. Delay fields varied in size between 0.1 and 0.6 degrees of visual angle.

The analysis of the torsional component of eye movement during the change of gravity between 1.8-0 and 0-1.8 g demonstrated a static component--well known as the ocular counter roll--and a dynamic component, which leads to a slight overshoot in the torsional response.

Method(s): Patients with histologic diagnosis of neurocytoma between 1994 and 2011 were identified through an IRB-approved database. Clinical, tumor, and treatment factors were evaluated. Survival times were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Seventeen patients with neurocytoma were treated, age at diagnosis 16.8 - 66.8 years; (median 35.3 years). Thirteen patients were male, all were Caucasian. Most common presenting symptoms: headaches (n=12) and gait disturbance (n=3). Sixteen patients had intraventricular lesions. All patients underwent surgery (gross total resection, GTR: 5, subtotal resection, STR: 10). Three patients (2 with STR and 1 with a biopsy) underwent adjuvant radiation; 2 with fractionated RT and one with stereotactic radiosurgery. Median event free survival (EFS) was 6.3 years and the projected 10 year EFS was 23%. Overall survival (OS) was 92%. The degree of resection did not correlate with EFS. After median follow-up of 8.4 years, 5 patients are without evidence of disease, 4 of which had developed recurrent disease and subsequently underwent GTR. Patients treated with adjuvant radiation did not experience disease recurrence (n=3). Twelve patients had Ki-67 results available from diagnosis (median 1.3%,), 4 had Ki-67 results at recurrence which was invariably higher than at presentation (median 10.5%) Ki-67 was not predictive for EFS or OS. Conclusion(s): In this cohort of patients, median EFS was only 6.3 years, and suggested a possible benefit to adjuvant radiotherapy in select cases. The excellent OS of 94% suggests that these patients benefit from salvage therapy with a combination of surgery and radiation.

4203,"Single electrode and multiple electrode guided electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in advanced Parkinson's disease OBJECTIVE: It is still debated to what extent intraoperative electrophysiological techniques contribute to the outcome of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS). Intraoperative electrophysiological recordings for identification of the STN can be made with one electrode or with multiple, simultaneously implanted electrodes. The latter provide more detailed information about the electrophysiological boundaries of the STN; however, implantation of several electrodes at one time might increase the risk of bleeding. Here we report the results of a study of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, in which one group of patients underwent bilateral STN DBS with electrophysiological recordings from a single electrode, and the other group received STN DBS with multiple (five or fewer) simultaneously implanted electrodes.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease who underwent bilateral STN stimulation were included in this study. Thirty-two patients underwent STN DBS guided by a single semi-microelectrode, and 23 patients underwent STN DBS guided with simultaneously implanted multiple microelectrodes. All patients were examined preoperatively and 3 and 12 months postoperatively with regard to activities of daily living, motor functions, and neuropsychological functions.RESULTS: We found that the simultaneous implantation of multiple electrodes does not increase the risk of bleeding or any other major intracranial complication. The use of multiple electrodes resulted in better motor results when compared with patients who underwent STN DBS guided with a single recording electrode. There were significantly more improvements in patients' tremor and rigidity, and as a consequence, a better total Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, Part III score was identified during the medication-off phase. Despite better motor effects, patients treated with multiple electrodes showed subtle deterioration in neuropsychological functions, particularly in memory function.CONCLUSION: STN DBS performed with multiple electrophysiological recording electrodes resulted in better motor outcome but induced specific mild declines in neuropsychological functions.",Excluded,0.0860335

En cas de CPC localise, la chimiotherapie est associee a une radiotherapie precoce, de preference acceleree hyperfractionnee. Quel que soit le stade, une irradiation cranienne propylactique est proposee chez les repondeurs. Le traitement de deuxieme ligne fait appel a la reintroduction de la chimiotherapie initiale en cas de CPC considere comme chimiosensible, et a une monotherapie, le topotecan, dans les CPC refractaires. Il n'existe actuellement aucune place pour les therapies ciblees en routine. Conclusions et perspectives: Compte tenu de la diminution de l'incidence du CPC, le nombre d'essais s'interessant aux CPC est egalement moindre. Des questions restent cependant irresolues et de meilleurs resultats de survie peuvent encore etre esperes. Actuellement, les efforts sont surtout tournes vers le demantelement moleculaire des CPC et le developpement de therapies ciblees en miroir des modifications biologiques identifiees. Introduction: It is recommended to use both the TNM classification and the Veterans Administration Lung Cancer Study Group classification to stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Treatment strategies can in most cases be pragmatically based on the limited (LS) versus extensive stage (ES) definitions. State of the Art: First line treatment of ES SCLC is chemotherapy, and particularly the cisplatin-etoposide combination. In LS SCLC, chemotherapy and early thoracic irradiation (preferentially hyper-fractionated accelerated radiotherapy) is standard treatment. Prophylactic cranial irradiation has been shown to prolong survival in responders with both LS and ES disease. Second line treatment consists of reintroduction of the firstline chemotherapy regimen in chemosensitive tumors. In patients with refractory SCLC, single-agent topotecan can be given as second line treatment. There is no indication for targeted therapy outside clinical trials. Conclusion(s): Because of a reduction in the proportion of SCLC, the number of trials addressing SCLC is decreasing. However, there are still many unanswered questions and better survival results are needed. Efforts for molecular subtyping of SCLC are ongoing, with the parallel search for therapies targeting the identified biomarkers. 2013 SPLF. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

4206,"Automated image enhancement significantly reduces radiation dosage in coronary angiographt with preserved image quality Aims: Radiation exposure is related with adverse events on population level. For healthcare workers the work related radiation dose allowed is limited by governing agencies for health purposes. Although the dosage patients receive is relatively limited, the as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA) principle remains applicable. ClarityIQ is developed to reduce the radiation exposure without loss of image quality. Methods and Results: Diagnostic coronary angiography images of the left coronary artery (LCA) were acquired in LAO 45 with 20 cranial angulation with hand injected contrast dye. Quality of ClarityIQ (50% radiation reduction) was compared with standard image acquisition (100% radiation exposure) and scored as better, good, fair and poor by the operator. Our preliminary data show that 47 patients (mean age 62.8+/-11.1) were enrolled. The mean BMI was 26.6 kg/m2+/-3.7. All had normal kidney function (MDRD >60) and no known previous myocardial infarction of the LCA. The image quality of the ClarityIQ images was of adequate diagnostic quality in all patients. ClarityIQ was not considered of better quality, in 29 cases the image quality was good and in 17 fair. In one case the operator judged the images poor based on a blurred aspect of the coronary tree, but still useful for diagnostic coronary angiography. The mean Air Kerma was 31.3 J/kg for ClarityIQ and 72.9 J/kg for the standard image acquisition (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that with a novel acquisition technique that enhances the coronary tree based on a computer algorithm adequate images can be acquired with a reduction of 43% of radiation dose. Thus resulting in less stochastic effects of radiation for the cath-lab personnel and also less deterministic effects for the patient. Further research is needed to assess whether ClarityIQ is also suitable for large patients and different angulations.",Excluded,0.08593766
4207,"Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma.METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival.RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD.CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume.",Excluded,0.5742687
4208,"Light Stress-Induced Increase of Sphingosine 1-Phosphate in Photoreceptors and Its Relevance to Retinal Degeneration Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent lipid mediator that modulates inflammation and angiogenesis. In this study, we investigated the possible involvement of S1P in the pathology of light-induced retinal degeneration in vivo and in vitro. The intracellular S1P and sphingosine kinase (SphK) activity in a photoreceptor cell line (661W cells) was significantly increased by exposure to light. The enhancement of SphK1 expression was dependent on illumination, and all-trans-retinal significantly promoted SphK1 expression. S1P treatment reduced protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation and increased the protein expression of cleaved caspase-3, and induced photoreceptor cell apoptosis. In vivo, light exposure enhanced the expression of SphK1 in the outer segments of photoreceptors. Intravitreal injection of a SphK inhibitor significantly suppressed the thinning of the outer nuclear layer and ameliorated the attenuation of the amplitudes of a-waves and b-waves of electroretinograms during light-induced retinal degeneration. These findings imply that light exposure induces the synthesis of S1P in photoreceptors by upregulating SphK1, which is facilitated by all-trans-retinal, causing retinal degeneration. Inhibition of this enhancement may be a therapeutic target of outer retinal degeneration, including age-related macular degeneration.",Excluded,0.085900016
4209,"Differential processing of laser stimuli by Adelta and C fibres in major depression Clinical studies have revealed that up to 92% of major depressed patients report pain complaints such as back or abdominal pain. Furthermore, patients suffering from depression exhibit increased superficial pain thresholds and decreased ischemic (deep) pain thresholds during experimental pain testing in comparison to healthy controls. Here, we aimed to investigate a putative role of Adelta- and C-fibre activation in altered pain perception in the disease. Laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) of 27 unmedicated depressed patients and 27 matched controls were recorded. Adelta and C fibres were activated separately. Amplitudes and latencies of N2 and P2 peaks of Adelta- (Adelta-LEP) and C-fibre- (C-LEP) related LEPs were evaluated. Depressed patients showed significantly decreased Adelta-LEP amplitudes (N2 peak: P=0.019; P2 peak: P=0.024) and delayed C-LEP latencies (P2 peak: P=0.0495; N2 peak: P=0.0556). In contrast, C-LEP amplitudes and Adelta-LEP latencies were unaffected. Our results might be suggestive of the differential impact of physiological changes on pain processing in depression. Thus, Adelta-LEP might reflect the physiological correlate of the augmented superficial pain thresholds during depression. On the contrary, the C-fibre component mediates the facets of pain processing, outlasting the stimulation period, and has been shown to be exaggerated in chronic pain states. Therefore, the functional over-representation of the C-fibre component found in our study might be a possible link between depression and associated pain complaints.",Excluded,0.08912785

This decrease was maximal at 5 h post exposure. Exposure to the 800 MHz RF for 1 h did not cause any significant effect, but exposure for 14 hrs induced a significant 43% decrease in ACh release during the period 11 p.m.-4 a.m. compared to control rats. In the control group we observed an increase of ACh release at the beginning of the night, which was linked to the waking period of rats.

Specific chromosomal changes in some A-T patients appear to be associated with cancer induction, and it is suggested that these could be linked to a DNA repair-fidelity defect. However, a general correlation between radiosensitivity and cancer-proneness is difficult to establish at present, partly because of diversity in radiosensitivity in the normal population.

4214,"A method to explore the possibility of nonlocal correlations between brain electrical activities of two spatially separated animal subjects It now appears possible to design an experiment which might reveal whether nonlocal correlations exist between brain electrical activities of spatially separated animal subjects, with initial emphasis on primates and dolphins. This would have the advantage of being based upon research presently being conducted at the University of Washington-Bastyr University and the University of Freiburg, which appears to reveal that a visual evoked potential elicited in the brain of one human subject via patterned photostimulation, can induce a nonlocal transferred potential in the brain of a second human subject, without any apparent classical neural or electromagnetic intervention, since both subjects are in Faraday chambers. An observation of nonlocality may also make it possible to investigate if consciousness or mental experiences exist in various nonhuman animal subjects. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We discuss 6 patients with such pelvic collections treated with transrectal drainage using catheter placement via Seldinger technique. Transrectal drainage helped achieve clinical and radiological resolution of pelvic collections in 6 and 5 of 6 cases, respectively. It simultaneously helped avoid injury to intervening bowel loops and neurovascular structures using real-time visualization of armamentarium used for drainage.

4216,"Copper alters aggregation behavior of prion protein and induces novel interactions between its N- and C-terminal regions Copper is reported to promote and prevent aggregation of prion protein. Conformational and functional consequences of Cu(2+)-binding to prion protein (PrP) are not well understood largely because most of the Cu(2+)-binding studies have been performed on fragments and truncated variants of the prion protein. In this context, we set out to investigate the conformational consequences of Cu(2+)-binding to full-length prion protein (PrP) by isothermal calorimetry, NMR, and small angle x-ray scattering. In this study, we report altered aggregation behavior of full-length PrP upon binding to Cu(2+). At physiological temperature, Cu(2+) did not promote aggregation suggesting that Cu(2+) may not play a role in the aggregation of PrP at physiological temperature (37 degreeC). However, Cu(2+)-bound PrP aggregated at lower temperatures. This temperature-dependent process is reversible. Our results show two novel intra-protein interactions upon Cu(2+)-binding. The N-terminal region (residues 90-120 that contain the site His-96/His-111) becomes proximal to helix-1 (residues 144-147) and its nearby loop region (residues 139-143), which may be important in preventing amyloid fibril formation in the presence of Cu(2+). In addition, we observed another novel interaction between the N-terminal region comprising the octapeptide repeats (residues 60-91) and helix-2 (residues 174-185) of PrP. Small angle x-ray scattering studies of full-length PrP show significant compactness upon Cu(2+)-binding. Our results demonstrate novel long range inter-domain interactions of the N- and C-terminal regions of PrP upon Cu(2+)-binding, which might have physiological significance.",Excluded,0.08639898

Dose-volume relationships are, however, inaccurate due to the small volume of most of the organs at risk involved and limited ability of irradiation techniques to spare these structures in the pre-IMRT (intensity-modulated radiation therapy) era. The ability of newest radiation techniques including IMRT and proton therapy to generate steep dose gradients may yield more accurate models in the future. Some toxicities are severe and irreversible, leading to vision loss, as in the case of radiation-induced optic neuropathy for which curative treatments are suboptimal. Other toxicities can lead to reversible vision loss but can be surgically corrected, as is the case for radiation-induced cataract. In this paper, we will review the dose effects for the ocular; orbital and eyelid structures.",Excluded,0.086482294

This study investigates the irradiated areas and doses received by patients undergoing cerebral embolisation, which is regarded as a high dose interventional radiology procedure. For each procedure the fluoroscopic and digital dose-area product (DAP), the fluoroscopic time, the total number of acquired images and entrance-skin dose (ESD) calculated by the angiographic unit were recorded. The ESD was measured by means of thermoluminescent dosimeters. In this study, the skin, eye and thyroid gland doses and the irradiated area for 30 patients were recorded. The average ESD was found to be 0.77 Gy for the posteroanterior plane and 0.78 Gy for the lateral plane. The average DAP was 48 Gy cm(2) for the posteroanterior plane and 58 Gy cm(2) for the lateral plane. The patient's average right eye dose was 60 mGy and the dose to the thyroid gland was 24 mGy. Seven patients received a dose above 1 Gy, one patient exceeded the threshold for transient erythema and one exceeded the threshold for temporary epilation.

Progesterone receptor immunoreactivity was detected in 70% of tumors. Estrogen receptor immunoreactivity was not detected. An inverse correlation was found between detection of progesterone receptors and the PFPCNA index. The overall 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 68%. The only prognostic factor that significantly affected PFS rate was the PFPCNA index. The 2-year PFS was 42% for tumors with a high PFPCNA index (value > or = 24%) and 91% for tumors with a low PFPCNA index (value < 24%). Tumors with a high PFPCNA index were 9.1 times as likely to recur as were tumors with a low PFPCNA index.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study confirms the value of irradiation for dogs with incompletely resected meningiomas. Prognostic value of the PFPCNA index suggests-that duration of treatment and interval from surgery to start of irradiation may affect outcome. Loss of progesterone receptors in some tumors may be responsible for an increase in PFPCNA index and may indirectly affect prognosis after radiation therapy.",Excluded,0.9669923
4221,"High dietary iron increases oxidative stress and radiosensitivity in the rat retina and vasculature after exposure to fractionated gamma radiation Radiation exposure in combination with other space environmental factors including microgravity, nutritional status, and deconditioning is a concern for long-duration space exploration missions. Astronauts experience altered iron homeostasis due to adaptations to microgravity and an iron-rich food system. Iron intake reaches three to six times the recommended daily allowance due to the use of fortified foods on the International Space Station. Iron is associated with certain optic neuropathies and can potentiate oxidative stress. This study examined the response of eye and vascular tissue to gamma radiation exposure (3 Gy fractionated at 37.5 cGy per day every other day for 8 fractions) in rats fed an adequate-iron diet or a high-iron diet. Twelve-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of four experimental groups: adequate-iron diet/no radiation (CON), high-iron diet/no radiation (IRON), adequate-iron diet/radiation (RAD), and high-iron diet/radiation (IRON+RAD). Animals were maintained on the corresponding iron diet for 2 weeks before radiation exposure. As previously published, the high-iron diet resulted in elevated blood and liver iron levels. Dietary iron overload altered the radiation response observed in serum analytes, as evidenced by a significant increase in catalase levels and smaller decrease in glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity levels. 8-OHdG immunostaining, showed increased intensity in the retina after radiation exposure. Gene expression profiles of retinal and aortic vascular samples suggested an interaction between the response to radiation and high dietary iron. This study suggests that the combination of gamma radiation and high dietary iron has deleterious effects on retinal and vascular health and physiology.",Included,0.98159444
4222,"Procoagulant and inflammatory mediators in small cell lung carcinoma: Potential role in thromboembolic complications Background: Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC) patients exhibit a higher prevalence of thromboembolic complications. We hypothesized that in this malignancy, procoagulant and inflammatory mediators contribute to the pathogenesis of such complications and warfarin may down regulate these levels. Method(s): In a prospective, randomized, controlled study, patients with inoperable lung cancer (n=100) were randomized to receive chemotherapy and radiation with and without warfarin (INR 1.5 - 2.5). Blood samples were drawn prior to and after the 2nd treatment cycle with warfarin or control and retrospectively analyzed for microparticles and thrombin generation markers such as fibrinopeptide A (FPA), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and prothrombin fragment F1.2 (F1.2). In addition, biochip array for C-reactive protein (CRP), D Dimer, neuron specific enolase (NSE), neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), and thrombomodulin (TM) were measured. The results were compared with a normal population (N=50). Result(s): The microparticles were markedly increased in the SCLC patients (3 fold increase) at baseline. Similary, the thrombin generation markers showed variable increase (1.5-3.2 fold increase). In the biochip array analysis, variable increase was noted. CRP (2.4 fold), D DIMER (11.6 fold), NSE (1.8 fold), NGAL (1.7 fold), TNFR1 (2 fold) and TM (1.3 fold) were all increased as compared to normal controls. All of the markers exhibited a decrease after warfarin treatment with a most pronounced decrease in the D Dimer and TNFR1. Conclusion(s): These results validate the hypothesis that SCLC patients exhibit a hypercoagulable state that is associated with simultaneous upregulation of inflammatory mediators. Warfarin treatment results in a down regulation of these mediators. Our results provide a rationale for prophylactic anticoagulant therapy in this group of patients.",Excluded,0.37358382
4223,"[Histochemical and ultrastructural studies on anti-edematous and radiation-protective action of 0-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-rutosides on the rat brain after single irradiation. 2. Histochemical study on carbohydrate metabolism and acid phosphatase activation] The disturbances of the carbohydrate metabolism and the activation of acid phosphatases with and without protection by O-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-rutoside (HR) were studied in irradiated rat brains by means of the light microscope. The histochemically demonstrable deposition of glycogen and acid mucopolysaccharides serves as a criterion for a reversible lesion of the irradiated cerebral tissue. The extent of local activation of repair processes following to irradiation can be determined by the quantity of acid phosphatases in the lysosomes. For the dose range of 1 to 5 Gy, HR seems to exert a protective effect on the cellular metabolism of the irradiated cerebral tissue shown by a slight decrease of glycogen and mucopolysaccharide deposits compared to the untreated animals. However, when exceeding a threshold dose of 10 Gy, the deposition of carbohydrates in the HR group is strongly increased. A slightly increased activity of acid phosphatases induced by HR can be supposed at best for the dose range of 5 to 7.5 Gy. If the dose is even more increased, the reverse effect found in the carbohydrate metabolism, too, and an increased activation of acid phosphatases in the control group will be observed. This unexpected reversion of the protective effect could be related to the assumed inhibitory effect of HR on the ATPases and thus on the anaerobic part of glycolysis or to a breakdown of the cell interaction system of endothelial cells, glia cells, and neurons.",Included,0.98391634
4224,"Thermography for perfusion analysis of the thoracic region after bypass grafting The use of the left internal thoracic artery for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is associated with higher long-term patency rates compared to autologous saphenous vein grafts. However, due to the devascularisation of the thoracic region there is a potential of postoperative sternal wound infection, occurring in approximately 4 % of all patients. To this day, there is still no preoperative diagnostic procedure to estimate the risk of a wound healing disorder. Thermography has proved to be suitable for medical imaging in breast cancer detection, brain mapping in neurosurgery, and dermatology among others. The measurement of thermal radiation is a highly sensitive, noninvasive and label-free methodology that allows for the identification of vital signs and the discrimination of normal from pathological tissue. In this contribution, thermal imaging is used to quantify the perfusion of the thoracic region of patients before and after CABG. We propose a method for the assessment of blood flow by evaluating the skin temperature of the left and right breast areas in a comparative study 1 day before the surgery and 2 hours, 1 day, and 7 days after surgery, respectively. As expected, the examined group of patients showed a hypoperfusion of left chest wall, indicated by a significant temperature drop compared to the right breast area. Postoperative we observe a continuous convergence in the skin temperatures of the left and right breast areas as an effect of revascularization in the left thoracic region. As a proof of concept, we show the feasibility to evaluate the perfusion of the thoracic region using contact-free thermal imaging. This lays the foundation for preoperative diagnostics in order to assess the risk of wound healing disorders.",Excluded,0.085543774
4225,"Diagnostic accuracy of whole-brain computed tomographic perfusion imaging in small-volume infarctions PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to determine the diagnostic accuracy of whole-brain computed tomographic perfusion (WB-CTP) in small ischemic brain infarctions and to identify factors influencing the detection rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Out of a retrospective cohort of 1380 subjects who underwent initial WB-CTP because of suspected stroke, we selected all patients with a supratentorial magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed ischemic infarction with a volume of 8 mL or less. Infratentorial lesions were excluded. The study was designed as a case-control study with a ratio of cases to controls with no infarction in follow-up magnetic resonance imaging of 1:3. Two blinded readers independently evaluated 4 different computed tomographic perfusion parameter data sets per subject with respect to the presence and localization of a perfusion deficit. RESULT(S): A total of 113 subjects met the inclusion criteria for the patient group. Overall, WB-CTP reached a sensitivity of 43.4% and a specificity of 92.9%. Among these, cortical infarctions were detected in 31 (69%) of 49 cases, whereas subcortical infarctions were detected only in 18 (28%) of 64 cases (P < 0.05). Mean final infarction diameter (17.3 mm) and volume (1.9 mL) of infarctions detected on CTP were significantly larger than those of infarctions not detected (12.4 mm and 0.8 mL, respectively; P < 0.001). Time from symptom onset did not differ significantly between infarctions that were detected or those that were not (204 vs 189 minutes; P = 0.75). CONCLUSION(S): The detection rate of WB-CTP in small infarctions highly depends on infarction localization and final size, whereas time from symptom onset does not seem to influence diagnostic accuracy.

All had a history of cranial irradiation, progressive ventriculomegaly visible on neuroimaging scans, and neurologic decline; other causes of hydrocephalus were excluded. All 31 patients had cognitive deficits: 30 had gait disturbance and 24 were incontinent.RESULTS: Twenty-four (80%) of 30 assessable patients achieved symptomatic improvement an average of 1.6 months after ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Incontinence and gait problems were more likely to improve than cognition. Sixteen (53%) of 30 patients achieved a good overall functional outcome, and incontinence was the only feature significantly associated with good outcome (P=.04). Neither cerebrospinal fluid-opening pressure nor tap tests predicted improvement from ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Median duration of improvement was 6 months, and median survival after receiving the shunt was 14.5 months. Shunt-related complications occurred in 10 (33%) of 30 patients, with 1 fatal outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Our results from ventriculoperitoneal shunting in selected patients with radiation-induced hydrocephalus suggest potential benefit.

Rats that had received embryonic day (E) 19-20 fetal retinal sheet transplants at the age of 26-30 days were tested at the ages of 200-254 days. Controls were age-matched rats without surgery and with sham surgery. As a baseline, in no-surgery line-5 rats, the temporal pattern of visual sensitivity loss was evaluated electrophysiologically in the SC from 60 days up to one year of age.RESULTS: In untreated S334ter-line-5 rats, decline in visual sensitivity in the SC was parallel to the photoreceptor loss. At 109 day of age, a relative scotoma developed in the area of the SC corresponding to the nasal retinal region. At 200-254 days of age, the majority of the SC was devoid of any light-driven responses. In contrast, at this time point, transplanted rats with 'good' retinal grafts with normal lamination had visual responses in the caudal region of the SC, the area corresponding topographically to the transplant location in the retina. In these rats, the various parameters of SC responses such as the latency of the onset of the visual response, the response peak amplitude and the consistency of the visual response were significantly different from the control groups (no-surgery, sham surgery, 'poor' transplants) and were more comparable to normal albino rats, however, with a slightly longer latency (70-90 vs. 30-50 msec).CONCLUSIONS: Fetal retinal sheet transplantation showed a long-term rescue effect on visual function in this animal model of slow photoreceptor degeneration.",Excluded,0.10644804

4229,"Reactive gliosis in the adult zebrafish retina In contrast to mammals, zebrafish posses the remarkable ability to regenerate retinal neurons. Damage to the zebrafish retina induces Muller glia to act as stem cells, generating retinal progenitors for regeneration. In contrast, injury in the mammalian retina results in Muller glial reactive gliosis, a characteristic gliotic response that is normally detrimental to vision. Understanding the signaling pathways that determine how Muller glia respond to injury is a critical step toward promoting regeneration in the mammalian retina. Here we report that zebrafish Muller glia exhibit signs of reactive gliosis even under normal regenerative conditions and that cell cycle inhibition increases this response. Persistently reactive Muller glia increase their neuroprotective functions, temporarily saving photoreceptors from a cytotoxic light lesion. However, the absence of a sustained proliferation response results in a significant inhibition of retinal regeneration. Interestingly, when cell cycle inhibition is released, a partial recovery of regeneration is observed.

Approximately 50% of patients with suspected ureteric colic do not have a nephro-urological cause for pain. Because many such patients require further imaging studies, NCCT may obviate the need for these studies and, in so doing, be more cost effective and involve less overall radiation exposure. The present study compares the total imaging cost and radiation dose of NCCT versus IVU in the diagnosis of acute flank pain. Two hundred and twenty-four patients (157 men; mean age 45 years; age range 19-79 years) with suspected renal colic were randomized either to NCCT or IVU. The number of additional diagnostic imaging studies, cost (IVU A$136; CTU A$173), radiation exposure and imaging times were compared. Of 119 (53%) patients with renal obstruction, 105 had no nephro-urological causes of pain. For 21 (20%) of these patients an alternative diagnosis was made at the initial imaging, 10 of which were significant. Of 118 IVU patients, 28 (24%) required 32 additional imaging tests to reach a diagnosis, whereas seven of 106 (6%) NCCT patients required seven additional imaging studies. The average total diagnostic imaging cost for the NCCT group was A$181.94 and A$175.46 for the IVU group (P < 0.43). Mean radiation dose to diagnosis was 5.00 mSv (NCCT) versus 3.50 mSv (IVU) (P < 0.001). Mean imaging time was 30 min (NCCT) versus 75 min (IVU) (P < 0.001). Diagnostic imaging costs were remarkably similar.

To understand extravasation kinetics and extravascular organ concentrations of AlbudAbs in humans, we studied tissue distribution and elimination of a non-conjugated <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeled AlbudAb in healthy volunteers using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Method(s): A non-conjugated AlbudAb (GSK3128349) was radiolabeled with <sup>89</sup>Zr and a single 1 mg (~ 15 MBq) dose intravenously administered to eight healthy males. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb tissue distribution was followed for up to 7 days with four whole-body PET/CT scans. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb tissue concentrations were quantified in organs of therapeutic significance, measuring standardized uptake value and tissue/plasma ratios. Plasma pharmacokinetics were assessed by gamma counting and LC-MS/MS of blood samples. Result(s): <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb administration and PET/CT procedures were well tolerated, with no drug-related immunogenicity or adverse events. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb rapidly distributed throughout the vasculature, with tissue/plasma ratios in the liver, lungs, and heart relatively stable over 7 days post-dose, ranging between 0.1 and 0.5. The brain tissue/plasma ratio of 0.025 suggested minimal AlbudAb blood-brain barrier penetration. Slowly increasing ratios in muscle, testis, pancreas, and spleen reflected either slow AlbudAb penetration and/or <sup>89</sup>Zr residualization in these organs. Across all tissues evaluated, the kidney tissue/plasma ratio was highest (0.5-1.5 range) with highest concentration in the renal cortex. The terminal half-life of the <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb was 18 days. Conclusion(s): Evaluating the biodistribution of <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb in healthy volunteers using a low radioactivity dose was successful (total subject exposure ~ 10 mSv). Results indicated rapid formation of reversible, but stable, complexes between AlbudAb and albumin upon dosing. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb demonstrated albumin-like pharmacokinetics, including limited renal elimination.

4234,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta inhibitors protect hippocampal neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis by regulating MDM2-p53 pathway Exposure of the brain to ionizing radiation can cause neurocognitive deficiencies. The pathophysiology of these neurological changes is complex and includes radiation-induced apoptosis in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. We have recently found that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) resulted in significant protection from radiation-induced apoptosis in hippocampal neurons. The molecular mechanisms of this cytoprotection include abrogation of radiation-induced accumulation of p53. Here we show that pretreatment of irradiated HT-22 hippocampal-derived neurons with small molecule inhibitors of GSK-3beta SB216763 or SB415286, or with GSK-3beta-specific shRNA resulted in accumulation of the p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Knockdown of MDM2 using specific shRNA or chemical inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction prevented the protective changes triggered by GSK-3beta inhibition in irradiated HT-22 neurons and restored radiation cytotoxicity. We found that this could be due to regulation of apoptosis by subcellular localization and interaction of GSK-3beta, p53 and MDM2. These data suggest that the mechanisms of radioprotection by GSK-3beta inhibitors in hippocampal neurons involve regulation of MDM2-dependent p53 accumulation and interactions between GSK-3beta, MDM2 and p53.",Included,0.9740128

However, the role of non-coding RNA and mRNA in radiation protection, especially in the nervous system, remains unknown. In this study, microarray profiles were used to determine microRNA (miRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and mRNA expression in the hypothalamus of mice that were pretreated with amifostine and subsequently exposed to high-dose IR. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed. We found that fewer miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs were induced by amifostine pre-treatment in exposed mice, which exhibited antagonistic effects compared to IR, indicating that amifostine attenuated the IR-induced effects on RNA profiles.

4237,"Up-regulation of the expression of cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide by electroacupuncture in the arcuate nucleus of diet-induced obese rats It was reported that acupuncture or electro-acupuncture (EA) is effective in reducing the body weight for obese patients, although the mechanisms remain obscure. In a previous study, we have found that rats fed with high-fat (HIF) diet developed diet-induced obesity (DIO) with a concomitant decrease in the hypothalamic content of the cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide, a peptide with anorexiogenic effect. To assess the central effect of EA on DIO rat, we revealed that EA up-regulated the expression of CART peptide in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the DIO rats. After feeding with HIF diet for 14 weeks, the DIO rats received EA stimulation three times per week for 4 weeks. The expression of CART peptide in ARC was measured using immunohistochemistry. The plasma ACTH was measured with ELISA. EA caused a reduction of both body weight and energy intake in DIO rats and increased the expression of CART peptide in ARC. The plasma ACTH was increased in response to restraint stress, but EA produced no further increase in ACTH levels. The results suggest that EA can up-regulate the expression of CART peptide to approach normal level, resulting in an inhibition of food intake and a reduction of body weight in DIO rats.",Excluded,0.08656861
4238,"Monte Carlo simulation of the spatial resolution and depth sensitivity of two-dimensional optical imaging of the brain Absorption or fluorescence-based two-dimensional (2-D) optical imaging is widely employed in functional brain imaging. The image is a weighted sum of the real signal from the tissue at different depths. This weighting function is defined as ""depth sensitivity."" Characterizing depth sensitivity and spatial resolution is important to better interpret the functional imaging data. However, due to light scattering and absorption in biological tissues, our knowledge of these is incomplete. We use Monte Carlo simulations to carry out a systematic study of spatial resolution and depth sensitivity for 2-D optical imaging methods with configurations typically encountered in functional brain imaging. We found the following: (i) the spatial resolution is <200 mum for NA<=0.2 or focal plane depth<=300 mum. (ii) More than 97% of the signal comes from the top 500 mum of the tissue. (iii) For activated columns with lateral size larger than spatial resolution, changing numerical aperature (NA) and focal plane depth does not affect depth sensitivity. (iv) For either smaller columns or large columns covered by surface vessels, increasing NA and/or focal plane depth may improve depth sensitivity at deeper layers. Our results provide valuable guidance for the optimization of optical imaging systems and data interpretation.",Excluded,0.08559893

The aim of this study was to determine the relation between changes in myelin basic protein (MBP) levels during the acute and subacute phases of central nervous system injury following whole-brain radiation and delayed demyelination in the radiation-injured brain tissue. Methods. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with single fractions of 2, 10, or 30 Gy of whole-brain radiation. The authors measured MBP gene expression and protein levels in the brain tissue by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at 1 week and 1-3 months following irradiation to monitor myelin changes in the brain. Demyelination was determined with Luxol fast blue myelin staining and routine histopathological and electron microscopy examination of injured brain tissue. The changes in MBP levels in the different animal groups at specific time points were correlated with demyelination in corresponding dose groups. Results. At 1 month after applying the 10 and 30 Gy of radiation, MBP mRNA expression showed a transient but significant decrease, followed by recovery to baseline levels at 3 months after treatment. The MBP levels were decreased by only 70-75% at 1 month after 10 and 30 Gy of radiation. At 2-3 months after applying the higher dose of 30 Gy, however, the MBP levels continued to decline, and typical demyelination changes were observed with myelin staining and ultrastructural examination. Conclusions. The authors' results suggest that the early radiation-induced MBP changes between 1 and 3 months af ter single treatments of 10 and 30 Gy of radiation to the whole brain are indicative of permanent injury shown as de myelination of irradiated brain tissue.",Included,0.9843843

Monophasic stimulation is more likely to achieve direction-specific neuronal excitation. In 10 healthy subjects, we compared four types of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), monophasic and biphasic stimuli with the initial current in the brain flowing antero-posteriorly (""posteriorly directed"") or postero-anteriorly (""anteriorly directed""). We applied rTMS over the primary motor cortex contralateral to the dominant hand, using 80 stimuli at 5 Hz frequency at an intensity yielding baseline motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes of 1 mV. Monophasic stimulation was always more efficient than biphasic. Facilitation was induced by intracerebral anteriorly directed current flow and inhibition by posteriorly oriented current flow, although only initially for approximately 30 pulses. The early inhibition was absent when studied during a tonic muscle contraction. Several mechanisms could account for these findings. They include a more efficient excitation of inhibiting circuits by posteriorly oriented pulses, and a back-propagating D-wave inhibiting early I-waves and thus inducing early inhibition of MEP amplitude. In any case biphasic rTMS results can be explained by a mixture of monophasic opposite stimulations. We propose the use of monophasic pulses for maximizing effects during rTMS.",Excluded,0.0856315
4244,"Radiation dose response of neurologic symptom improvement during radiotherapy for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma PURPOSE: To investigate the association between radiation dose response and neurologic symptom improvement and survival outcomes in patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). METHODS AND MATERIALS: 108 patients with newly-diagnosed DIPG were treated with conventionally-fractionated radiation therapy (RT) to 54Gy (median) at our institution from 2006 to 2014. The presence and severity of neurological symptoms related to cranial neuropathy (CN) and cerebellar (CB) and long tract (LT) signs prior to and weekly during RT was reviewed for each patient. The incidence and rate of change of each symptom category was evaluated to determine the impact of clinical variables and brain sub-region volumes using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULT(S): Median dose to first sign of symptomatic improvement was 16.2Gy (CN), 21.6Gy (CB) and 19.8Gy (LT). Most patients showed any improvement by 20Gy. Black race was associated with improved LT signs at significantly lower cumulative RT doses (P=0.027). Larger uninvolved brainstem volume alone and normalized to total brain (TB) or posterior fossa volume (PF) was associated with a shorter time to LT sign improvement (P=0.044, P=0.033, and P=0.05, respectively). Patients with any improvement in CN experienced significantly prolonged progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (P=0.002 and P=0.008, respectively). Tumor volume, with or without normalization to TB or PF, was not significantly associated with PFS or OS. CONCLUSION(S): Low cumulative doses of RT provided neurologic improvement in the majority of patients with DIPG.

4248,"Failla Memorial lecture. The future of heavy-ion science in biology and medicine Interplanetary space contains fluxes of fast moving atomic nuclei. The distribution of these reflects the atomic composition of the universe, and such particles may pose limitations for space flight and for life in space. Over the past 50 years, since the invention of Ernest Lawrence's cyclotron, advances in accelerator technology have permitted the acceleration of charged nuclei to very high velocities. Currently, beams of any stable isotope species up to uranium are available at kinetic energies of several hundred MeV/nucleon at the Berkeley Bevalac. Recently, new areas of particle physics research relating to the mechanisms of spallation and fission have opened up for investigation, and it is now realistic to search for nuclear super-dense states that might be produced in heavy nuclear collisions. The heavy ions hold interest for a broad spectrum of research because of their effectiveness in producing a series of major lesions in DNA along single particle tracks and because of the Bragg depth ionization properties that allow the precise deposition of highly localized doses deep in the human body. Individual heavy ions can also interrupt the continuity of membraneous regions in cells. Heavy ions, when compared to low-LET radiation, have increased effectiveness for mammalian cell lethality, chromosome mutations, and cell transformation. The molecular mechanisms are not completely understood but appear to involve fragmentation and reintegration of DNA. Cells attempt to repair these lesions, and many of the deleterious effects are due to misrepair or misrejoining of DNA. Heavy ions do not require the presence of oxygen for producing their effects, and hypoxic cells in necrotic regions have nearly the same sensitivity as cells in well-oxygenated tissues. Heavy ions are effective in delaying or blocking the cell division process. Heavy ions are also strong enhancers of viral-induced cell transformation, a process that requires integration of foreign DNA. Some cell lines, known to be radioresistant to X rays, have exhibited greater sensitivity to heavy ions. These radiobiological properties, combined with the ability to deliver highly localized internal doses, make accelerated heavy ions potentially important radiotherapeutic tools. Other novel approaches include the utilization of radioactive heavy beams as instant tracers. Heavy-ion radiography and microscopy respond to delicate changes in tissue electron density. Dose localization with helium ions has achieved excellent results for pituitary tumors, tumors adjacent to the spinal cord, and ocular melanomas. We are working on adapting silicon- and neon-ion beams for controlled therapy studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) [References: 119]",Excluded,0.087157965

Patients were 20 to 70 years of age and had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1. The radiotherapy protocol consisted of whole-pelvis external beam radiotherapy and HDR-ICBT. The cumulative linear quadratic equivalent dose (EQD2) was 62 to 65 Gy prescribed at point A. Cisplatin was administered weekly at a dose of 40 mg/m(2) for 5 courses.RESULTS: Between March 2008 and January 2009, 72 patients from 25 institutions were enrolled, and 71 patients were eligible and evaluable for compliance and severe toxicity. The median age of the patients was 57 years (range, 32-70 years). Sixty-five patients (92%) received the planned 5 courses of chemotherapy. Four patients had cisplatin dose reduction according to the protocol. Radiotherapy was completed per protocol in 68 patients (96%). Median overall treatment time was 50 days (range, 37-66 days). The following grade 3 or 4 acute adverse events were observed: neutropenia in 31 patients (44%), anemia in 10 patients (14%), diarrhea in 4 patients (6%), and anorexia in 3 patients (4%).CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with HDR-ICBT and standard weekly delivery of cisplatin was feasible with acceptable toxicity in Japanese patients with cervical cancer.",Excluded,0.08664605

4252,"Combining low-dose whole brain radiation with radioimmunotherapy for primary central nervous system lymphoma Purpose/Objective(s): Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive B-cell disorder that initially responds well to therapy, but a majority of patients relapse within 2 years. High-dose whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) was once the primary treatment, but eventual relapses and late neurocognitive sequelae were frequently observed. The addition of CNS-directed chemotherapy to WBRT improved duration of response, with a concomitant increase in neurocognitive problems. More recently, medical oncologists have attempted to avoid radiation altogether, with similar clinical responses as seen with WBRT alone. The addition of rituximab has yielded little improvement due to the poor efficiency (<1%) of the antibody to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). WBRT has been shown to temporarily disrupt the BBB permeability to macromolecules for several hours.We hypothesized that adjuvant low-dose WBRT followed by anti-CD20-directed radioimmunotherapy (RIT) may allow for specific dose escalation to areas of tumor cells while avoiding extra dose to uninvolved areas of the brain, decreasing the chance for significant neurocognitive deficits. Materials/Methods: Four patients (71F, 69M, 48F, 53M) with PCNSL (3 relapsed, 1 newly diagnosed) were treated with low-dose (18 Gy in 10 fractions) WBRT,with 90Yibritumomab tiuxetan RIT given immediately after the final WBRT fraction. None of the patients had previously received radiation therapy.Median RIT dosewas 24.5 (21.8-32) mCi. All patients were restaged with contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain at 3 months, and every 3 months following. At baseline and at each follow-up visit, neurocognition was tested and family members were asked about subjective changes. Result(s): All four patients obtained a complete response to chemotherapy + low-dose WBRT + RIT. After a median follow-up of 17.5 (12-20) months, no relapses have been observed. No decline in neurocognitive function (objective or subjective) has been seen; in fact, improvement was seen in 3 patients. All patients tolerated the regimen well, with the typical transient decline and recovery of blood counts seen with RIT. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant low-dose WBRT and RIT following CNS-directed chemotherapy appears to be safe in this small sample. Complete responses were seen in all patients, and this appears to be durable compared to standard PCNSL salvage therapies. No neurocognitive deficits were seen following this novel radiation therapy regimen. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.",Excluded,0.0869516
4253,"A mouse model replicating hippocampal sparing cranial irradiation in humans: A tool for identifying new strategies to limit neurocognitive decline Cancer patients undergoing cranial irradiation are at risk of developing neurocognitive impairments. Recent evidence suggests that radiation-induced injury to the hippocampi could play an important role in this cognitive decline. As a tool for studying the mechanisms of hippocampal-dependent cognitive decline, we developed a mouse model replicating the results of the recent clinical RTOG 0933 study of hippocampal sparing whole-brain irradiation. We irradiated 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice to a single dose of 10 Gy using either whole-brain irradiation (WBRT) or hippocampal sparing irradiation (HSI). These animals, as well as sham-irradiated controls, were subjected to behavioral/cognitive assessments distinguishing between hippocampal-dependent and hippocampal-independent functions. Irradiation was well tolerated by all animals and only limited cell death of proliferating cells was found within the generative zones. Animals exposed to WBRT showed significant deficits compared to sham-irradiated controls in the hippocampal-dependent behavioral task. In contrast, HSI mice did not perform significantly different from sham-irradiated mice (control group) and performed significantly better when compared to WBRT mice. This is consistent with the results from the RTOG 0933 clinical trial, and as such this animal model could prove a helpful tool for exploring new strategies for mitigating cognitive decline in cancer patients receiving cranial irradiation.",Included,0.98428994

4255,"Flow effect impacts NIRS, jeopardizing quantification of tissue hemoglobin It has been generally agreed that changes in light transmission detected by NIRS are not exclusively attributable to hemoglobin changes, but also include a contribution from scattering by constituents of the brain tissue, which is not transparent, but turbid. If the light scattering is constant, light transmission can be quantified by an equation similar to Lambert-Beer's law. However, upon brain activation, it is known that the blood flow invariably increases. We have shown that light scattering by blood per se increases flow-dependently, interfering with the measurement of the intrinsic signals from hemoglobin. I call this the flow effect. Here, in responses to Pourtian's comments, I present additional evidence of the flow effect, which arises from RBC aggregation/dispersion, and further point out the inappropriateness of using NIR range wavelengths for the quantification of blood hemoglobin, even though their use is unavoidable in practice, because this wavelength range offers the best transmission through the tissue. In summary, I believe that the NIRS signal is a function of both flow (flow effect, which becomes the predominant contributor when blood flow increases) and metabolism (blood oxygenation change, which becomes accordingly a minor contributor). If the contribution of the flow effect is unknown, any mathematical equation describing the hemoglobin oxygenation is a Pfaffian equation which has no solution. This does not mean that I deny the clinical usefulness of NIRS, which definitely provides an indication of some biological changes in the brain in response to stimuli. However, great care is needed in the interpretation of the signals.",Excluded,0.08593599
4256,"Astroglial swelling in the neuronal depolarization ensemble The coupling between neuronal depolarization and astroglial swelling was examined. First, previous in vitro data for the swelling of cultured neurons (N18; rat neuroblastoma) and astroglia (C6; rat astroglyoma) upon exposure to a hypoosmotic solution were reappraised. Neurons swelled rapidly, forming blisters, and easily burst. whereas astroglia resisted swelling and slowly assumed a large full-moon shape. The time constant of swelling was 35.2 +/- 7.8 s for N18 and 594.8 +/- 554.0 s for C6. The glial plasmic membrane was found to be much stronger than the neuronal one, presumably due to a well-developed cytoskeleton. To overcome such neuronal membranous weakness, strong astroglial processes need to cover the neurons including the cell body and synapses, as demonstrated electron-microscopically. Next, in situ astroglial swelling was investigated in rats. During K(+)-induced cortical spreading depression, increases or decreases of a wave-ring spread of light (550 nm) transmission through a 1 mm-thick cerebral cortical layer was observed. The moving local optical density decrease in the cortex was attributable to local vascular bed compression induced by astroglial swelling, since concomitant occurrence of colocated dynamic capillary flow stall was confirmed by a hemodilution technique. Astroglial swelling may occur in an ensemble acting during neuronal depolarization, suggesting that neurons and astroglia behave like a unit complex.",Excluded,0.08588557

OS can provide information regarding intrinsic tissue optical properties such as tissue structure, nuclear density, and the presence or absence of endogenous or exogenous fluorophores. Among other applications, this information has been used to distinguish tumor from normal brain tissues, to detect tumor margins in intrinsic, infiltrating gliomas, to identify radiation damage to tissues, and to assess tissue viability and predict the onset of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Potential applications of OS include detection of specific central nervous system (CNS) structures, such as brain nuclei, identification of cell types by the presence of specific neurotransmitters, and the detection of optically labeled cells or drugs during therapeutic interventions.

In this study, the effect of Corilagin on RIBI was investigated and the underlying mechanisms were explored. Spatial learning and memory ability of mice were investigated by the Morris water maze test. Evans blue leakage and electron microscopy were used to assess the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB). The mRNA and protein expressions of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, were measured by using real-time PCR and Western blotting. The activation of microglial cells and expression of TNF-alpha were examined by immunofluorescence staining. Phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) and IkappaBalpha, and the translocation of p65 from cytoplasm to nucleus were detected by using Western blotting. Morris water maze test showed that Corilagin ameliorated the neurocognitive deficits in RIBI mice. Evans blue leakage and electron microscopy exhibited that Corilagin partially protected the BBB integrity from cranial irradiation-caused damage; immunofluorescence staining showed that Corilagin could inhibit microglial activation and TNF-alpha expression. Real-time PCR and Western blotting revealed that Corilagin downregulated the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and inhibited the irradiation-induced activation of NF-kappaB pathways by upregulating p-STAT3 expression. In conclusion, Corilagin could attenuate RIBI through inhibiting microglial activation and the expressions of inflammatory cytokines.

4267,"De Novo Development of Moyamoya Disease after Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Arteriovenous Malformation in a Patient With RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys (rs112735431) BACKGROUND: Reports of cases diagnosed as Moyamoya disease (MMD) after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are extremely rare. In recent years, ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) has been identified as a susceptibility gene of MMD, but the mechanism by which MMD develops remains unclear. Those cases of de novo development of MMD may provide some clues to clarify the mechanism of progression of MMD.CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of de novo MMD that developed after SRS for AVM. This patient presented with a variant of the RNF213 gene. The intracranial internal carotid artery was not within the irradiation field; therefore it was obvious that the development of MMD was not caused by the direct effect of radiation in the current case study. Moreover, we demonstrated the decrease in velocity in the internal carotid artery prior to the development of MMD using phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography. Previous studies demonstrated that progression of the pathological condition in the cerebral arteries in response to hemodynamic changes is enhanced in patients with RNF213 variants.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the changes in the intracranial hemodynamics after SRS for AVM could trigger the de novo onset of MMD in patients with a genetic predisposition for the RNF213 variant.",Excluded,0.08753008
4268,"Atypical retardation patterns in scanning laser polarimetry are associated with low peripapillary choroidal thickness PURPOSE: Scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) results can be affected by an atypical retardation pattern (ARP). One reason for an ARP is the birefringence of the sclera. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of the peripapillary choroidal thickness (pChTh) on the occurrence of ARP.METHODS: One hundred ten healthy subjects were investigated with SLP and spectral domain OCT. pChTh was measured in B-scan images at 768 positions using semiautomatic software. Values were averaged to 32 sectors and the total peripapillary mean. Subjects were divided into four groups according to the typical scan score (TSS) provided by the GDxVCC: group 1 TSS, 100; group 2 TSS, 90-99; group 3 TSS, 80-89; group 4 TSS, <80.RESULTS: Mean pChTh (+/- SD) in 110 healthy subjects was 141 mum (+/-49 mum). There was a significant correlation between pChTh and TSS (r = 0.608; P < 0.001). In TSS groups 1 to 4, mean pChTh was 168 mum (+/-38 mum), 148 mum (+/- 48 mum), 119 mum (+/-35 mum), and 92 (+/-42 mum). Mean pChTh of TSS groups 3 and 4 was significantly lower than that of TSS group 1 (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Low values of TSS resulting from the appearance of ARP in SLP are associated with low peripapillary choroidal thickness. Reduced choroidal thickness may result in an increased amount of confounding light getting to the SLP light detectors.",Excluded,0.0913055
4269,"Modulation of cone horizontal cell activity in the teleost fish retina. III. Effects of prolonged darkness and dopamine on electrical coupling between horizontal cells The effects of prolonged darkness and dopamine on the coupling between horizontal cells in the isolated, superfused white perch retina were studied. Two assays of coupling were employed; area versus amplitude relationships (area-response curves) and the diffusion of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow from intracellularly injected cells to neighboring cells. In prolonged dark-adapted retinas, area-response curves were difficult to determine because of the small light responses; however, light-evoked responses did not increase in size when light spots were larger than 0.8 mm in diameter. Following the presentation of dim background illumination that partially sensitized the retina, responses to light spots of various sizes were enhanced and an area-response curve could be constructed. Subsequent presentation of moderate background illumination that more fully sensitized the retina resulted in reduced responses to small spots (less than 1.6 mm in diameter) and enhanced responses to large spot or full-field stimuli. In retinas exposed to moderate background illumination, Lucifer yellow injected intracellularly into cone horizontal cells diffused into many neighboring horizontal cells. The coupled cells were very similar in morphology, suggesting they were of the same type. In prolonged dark-adapted retinas, on the other hand, the dye was usually restricted to the injected cell and a few adjacent cells. These results indicate that coupling between cone horizontal cells is modulated by prolonged darkness and background illumination. Following dopamine (50 microM) application, in both 6-OHDA-treated and untreated retinas, changes in area-response curves of cone horizontal cells were observed just opposite to those that occurred when prolonged dark-adapted retinas were exposed to background illumination. That is, following 5 min application of dopamine to the retina, responses to small spots (less than 2 mm in diameter) increased in size while responses to larger spots decreased in amplitude compared with control responses. Following 20 min of superfusion with dopamine, the recorded responses were very small, and an accurate area-response curve could not be determined. Following dopamine application to light-sensitized retinas, Lucifer yellow was restricted to the injected cells or to the injected cell and a few neighboring cells. The results suggest that the modulation of coupling between cone horizontal cells by prolonged darkness and background illumination may be mediated by dopamine. Spatial properties of rod horizontal cells were also examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Excluded,0.0872416
4270,"Standardization of terminology in stereotactic radiosurgery: Report from the Standardization Committee of the International Leksell Gamma Knife Society: special topic OBJECT: This report has been prepared to ensure more uniform reporting of Gamma Knife radiosurgery treatment parameters by identifying areas of controversy, confusion, or imprecision in terminology and recommending standards.METHODS: Several working group discussions supplemented by clarification via email allowed the elaboration of a series of provisional recommendations. These were also discussed in open session at the 16th International Leksell Gamma Knife Society Meeting in Sydney, Australia, in March 2012 and approved subject to certain revisions and the performance of an Internet vote for approval from the whole Society. This ballot was undertaken in September 2012.RESULTS: The recommendations in relation to volumes are that Gross Target Volume (GTV) should replace Target Volume (TV); Prescription Isodose Volume (PIV) should generally be used; the term Treated Target Volume (TTV) should replace TVPIV, GTV in PIV, and so forth; and the Volume of Accepted Tolerance Dose (VATD) should be used in place of irradiated volume. For dose prescription and measurement, the prescription dose should be supplemented by the Absorbed Dose, or DV% (for example, D95%), the maximum and minimum dose should be related to a specific tissue volume (for example, D2% or preferably D1 mm3), and the median dose (D50%) should be recorded routinely. The Integral Dose becomes the Total Absorbed Energy (TAE). In the assessment of planning quality, the use of the Target Coverage Ratio (TTV/ GTV), Paddick Conformity Index (PCI = TTV2/[GTV . PIV]), New Conformity Index (NCI = [GTV . PIV]/TTV2), Selectivity Index (TTV/PIV), Homogeneity Index (HI = [D2% -D98%]/D50%), and Gradient Index (GI = PIV0.5/PIV) are reemphasized. In relation to the dose to Organs at Risk (OARs), the emphasis is on dose volume recording of the VATD or the dose/volume limit (for example, V10) in most cases, with the additional use of a Maximum Dose to a small volume (such as 1 mm3) and/or a Point Dose and Mean Point Dose in certain circumstances, particularly when referring to serial organs. The recommendations were accepted by the International Leksell Gamma Knife Society by a vote of 92% to 8%.CONCLUSIONS: An agreed-upon and uniform terminology and subsequent standardization of certain methods and procedures will advance the clinical science of stereotactic radiosurgery.",Excluded,0.08599172

Recent data have shown an in vitro synergy of the HDAC inhibitor S78454 (also called PCI- 24781) with ionizing radiation, via inhibition of homologous recombinational (HR) repair of DNA double-strand breaks. We propose in this study to investigate the in vivo radiosensitizer effect of S78454 on human glioblastoma model. For this, we generated orthotopic U87 human glioblastoma xenografts in nude mice. Intra-peritoneal (i.p.) S 78454 treatment was performed daily starting 10 days after the engraftment. Irradiation was performed in one daily 2 Gy localized fraction during 4 days followed by a second similar 4 days treatment performed after 3 days off (for a total dose of 16 Gy administrated on 11 days). Survival experiments were conducted in mice bearing xenografts in the four different groups of treatment (vehicle, S 78454 alone, radiation alone, S 78454 + radiation). Mice bearing orthotopic xenografts were sacrificed at the onset of neurological signs. Survival curves were then performed. We first determined the S78454 dosing schedule to obtain a pharmacodynamic effect of the compound in the xenograft. Inhibition of RAD 51 expression, histone H3 and tubulin acetylation in the tumor were obtained 24 hours after daily i.p. treatment with 50mg/kg S78454. These results allowed us to define the schedule treatment combining S78454 with radiotherapy: mice were treated with S78454 50 mg/kg/d i.p., daily from Days 10 to14 and then from Days 17 to 21; one 2 Gy fraction radiotherapy was performed daily from Days 11 to14 and Days 18 to 21. In these conditions of treatment, S78454 was well tolerated Survival of the mice treated with S78454 alone was not significantly increased while the survival of the mice treated with irradiation alone was significantly increased compared to the control group (P<0.05). In contrast, the survival of the mice treated with the combined treatment was significantly increased compared to the group of animals treated with irradiation alone (P<0.05) and to the group treated with S78454 alone (P<0.01). Effect of S78454 on angiogenesis will be presented.

4279,"A novel TNFRSF member, TROY (TNFRSF19), is upregulated in glioblastoma and mediates glioblastoma cell invasion and survival Glioblastoma (GB) is the most malignant form of all primary adult brain tumors. Of the features that characterize GB, arguably none is more clinically significant than the propensity of glioma cells to aggressively invade the surrounding normal brain tissue. These invasive cells render complete resection impossible and confer resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. To improve treatment of malignant glioma, we must find a way to stop the dispersing tumor cells. Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily and their cognate receptors regulate various cellular responses including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. The TROY gene (TNFRSF19) encodes an orphan member of the TNFR superfamily: a type I cell-surface receptor that lacks a cytoplasmic death domain but contains a single TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-binding site. We demonstrate that TROY expression correlates inversely with patient survival and drives GB cell migration and invasion. Our results showed that TROY overexpression in glioma cells activated Rac1 signaling in a Pyk2-dependent manner to drive invasion and migration. Knockdown of TROY in a primary GB xenograft significantly prolonged survival in vivo. In addition, when we activated expression of TROY in mouse astrocytes in vivo using an RCAS vector system for glial-specific gene transfer in G-tva transgenic mice, astrocyte migration was induced within the brain, corroborating the in vitro importance of the TROY signaling cascade in GB invasion. TROY expression significantly increased resistance of GB cells to both IRand TMZ-induced apoptosis in vitro via the Akt and NF-kappaB activation. Inhibition of either Akt or NF-kappaB activity suppressed the survival benefits of TROY signaling in response to TMZ treatment. These findings suggest that the aberrant expression and/or signaling by TROY contributes to, and possibly drives, the malignant dispersion of glioma cells.",Excluded,0.08643654
4280,"GABA-enhanced collective behavior in neuronal axons underlies persistent gamma-frequency oscillations Gamma (30-80 Hz) oscillations occur in mammalian electroencephalogram in a manner that indicates cognitive relevance. In vitro models of gamma oscillations demonstrate two forms of oscillation: one occurring transiently and driven by discrete afferent input and the second occurring persistently in response to activation of excitatory metabotropic receptors. The mechanism underlying persistent gamma oscillations has been suggested to involve gap-junctional communication between axons of principal neurons, but the precise relationship between this neuronal activity and the gamma oscillation has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that gamma oscillations coexist with high-frequency oscillations (>90 Hz). High-frequency oscillations can be generated in the axonal plexus even when it is physically isolated from pyramidal cell bodies. They were enhanced in networks by nonsomatic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<inf>A</inf>) receptor activation, were modulated by perisomatic GABA<inf>A</inf> receptor-mediated synaptic input to principal cells, and provided the phasic input to interneurons required to generate persistent gamma-frequency oscillations.

Material(s) and Method(s): Phytotherapy was introduced after the tumour had progressed. It consisted of 4 types of herbal medicine which the subject was taking in form of tea once a day at regular intervals. The patient started phytotherapy along with temozolomide, which was the only oncological treatment she was under after the tumour had progressed. Following the finished chemotherapy, the patient continued the treatment with herbal medicine only. She regularly took phytotherapy without interruption and to the fullest extent for 30 months, and the results of treatment were monitored by periodic scanning using nuclear magnetic resonance technique. Result(s): The control scanning that was conducted after the end of combined treatment with temozolomide and phytotherapy showed tumour regression. The patient continued with phytotherapy after finishing chemotherapy and, during the following 24 months, it was the sole treatment option. In that period, the regression of the tumour continued, until a control examination 30 months after the introduction of phytotherapy showed no clinical and radiological signs of tumour. Conclusion(s): The results presented in this research paper clearly indicate the potential of phytotherapy in the treatment of some types of brain tumours. A complete regression of tumour following the treatment with nothing but herbal medicine offers support for such claim. Future research should demonstrate the effectiveness of phytotherapy, as a supplementary form of brain tumour treatment, and the results of this research should be compared with the existing information on the effectiveness of the protocols currently used in the treatment of these types of tumour.

Its role in the neuroradiologic evaluation of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has rapidly become a major diagnostic technique, displacing computed tomography (CT) as the primary neuroimaging modality in many disorders of the central nervous system. Neuroimaging studies are valuable in the diagnosis and management of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome. This article reviews the technique of MRI and its role in identifying the characteristic central nervous system manifestations of these neurocutaneous syndromes.OBSERVATIONS: MRI offers superior soft-tissue contrast without the use of ionizing radiation. It provides more detailed imaging than CT of the characteristic central nervous system lesions of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome. In neurofibromatosis type 1, these include optic glioma, astrocytoma, and plexiform neurofibroma, and ""unidentified bright objects"" that are seen only with MRI. Bilateral acoustic neuromas are the hallmark of neurofibromatosis type 2. Subependymal nodules and cortical and white matter tubers are characteristic of tuberous sclerosis. Manifestations of Sturge-Weber syndrome include leptomeningeal angiomatosis, hemiatrophy, cortical calcification, and patchy parenchymal gliosis and demyelination.CONCLUSIONS: MRI, especially with gadolinium enhancement, appears to be more sensitive than CT in the detection of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome. MRI may be the imaging method of choice for following certain patients or screening family members. [References: 86]",Excluded,0.08656008

Laser pulses selectively excite free nerve endings in the superficial skin layers and evoke Adelta-related brain potentials (LEPs). From earlier studies and new cases we collected data on 270 patients with sensory neuropathy. LEPs often disclosed subclinical dysfunction of Adelta fibres and proved a sensitive and reliable diagnostic tool for assessing small-fibre function in sensory neuropathy.

4290,"Reducing mandibular height to increase mouth opening in unreleasable trismus PURPOSE: We submit an alternative treatment for unreleasable trismus to increase the interincisal distance and allow adequate oral nutrition and masticatory function.PATIENT AND METHODS: The patient presented with severe trismus after receiving postoperation radiotherapy for oral carcinoma. We undertook radical release of the left-sided trismus, and covered the resultant soft tissue defect with an anterolateral thigh free flap, but the patient was only able to open his mouth an interincisal distance of 8 mm. The right mandible was accessed and the functionless residual teeth were extracted. Marginal mandibulectomy of the native mandible was performed.RESULTS: Dental implants (POI, Kyocera, Japan) were inserted into the leveled right mandible. A bridge dental prosthesis was inserted and resulted in a final functional interincisal distance of 19 mm.CONCLUSION: We offer that leveling the native mandible to match the reconstructed side is a simple procedure that can be reasonably used as an alternative measure in a selected group of patients.",Excluded,0.086157374
4291,"Long-term results of hyperfractionated radiation therapy and concomitant chemotherapy for T3 and T4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): The optimal fractionation schedule for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) involving the base of skull and intracranium is unknown.We found hyperfractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) and concomitant chemotherapy (CCT) could achieve better local control and survival in NPC patients with T3 and T4 lesions at 3 year follow up. To confirm the effect of this approach, we analyzed more patients with long term follow up. Materials/Methods: From January 1992 to Dec 2003, 222 patients (74 T3 and 148 T4 NPC) were treated with hyperfractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) and concomitant chemotherapy (CCT). HFRT was administered at 1.2 Gy per fraction, two fractions per day, Monday-Friday for 62 fractions for a total dose of 74.4 Gy. Concomitant chemotherapy consisting of cis-diamino-dichloroplatinum (CDDP) alone or CDDP and 5-fluorouracil were delivered simultaneously with radiotherapy during Weeks 1 and 6. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of CDDP and 5-fluorouracil for 2 to 3 cycles and was given monthly beginning 1 month after completion of radiation. Result(s):With a median follow-up of 102 months (range: 5 - 186 months), the 5-year locoregional control rate, distant-metastasis free, disease-free and overall survivals were 81.9%, 78.5%, 65.5% and 73.6%, respectively. At 10 years, the 10-year locoregional control rate, distant-metastasis free, disease-free and overall survivals were 76.7%, 75.5%, 60.5% and 64.2%, respectively. For T4 patients, the 10-year locoregional control rate, distant-metastasis free, disease-free and overall survivals were 73.0%, 70.5%, 53.0% and 58.4%, respectively. The major chronic toxicity was Grade 3/4 hearing impairment in 14% of patients. Brain necrosis rate is 2.3%. Conclusion(s): HFRT and CCT for T3 and T4 NPC were associated with good local control, survival and little treatment-related long term toxicity. But, the 10 year treatment result is suboptimal. To further improve the 10 year locoregional control rate for T4 NPC patients, we may consider using HFRT to give higher radiation dose up to 78 Gy with CCT in the IMRT era.",Excluded,0.08772922
4292,"GAP-independent termination of photoreceptor light response by excess gamma subunit of the cGMP-phosphodiesterase We have generated a mouse with rod photoreceptors overexpressing the gamma inhibitory subunit (PDE6gamma) of the photoreceptor G-protein effector cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6). PDE6gamma overexpression decreases the rate of rise of the rod response at dim intensities, indicating a reduction in the gain of transduction that may be the result of cytoplasmic PDE6gamma binding to activated transducin alpha GTP (Talpha-GTP) before the Talpha-GTP binds to endogenous PDE6gamma. Excess PDE6gamma also produces a marked acceleration in the falling phase of the light response and more rapid recovery of sensitivity and circulating current after prolonged light exposure. These effects are not mediated by accelerating GTP hydrolysis through the GAP (GTPase activating protein) complex, because the decay of the light response is also accelerated in rods that overexpress PDE6gamma but lack RGS9. Our results show that the PDE6gamma binding sites of PDE6 alpha and beta are accessible to excess (presumably cytoplasmic) PDE6gamma in the light, once endogenous PDE6gamma has been displaced from its binding site by Talpha-GTP. They also suggest that in the presence of Talpha-GTP, the PDE6gamma remains attached to the rest of the PDE6 molecule, but after conversion of Talpha-GTP to Talpha-GDP, the PDE6gamma may dissociate from the PDE6 and exchange with a cytoplasmic pool. This pool may exist even in wild-type rods and may explain the decay of rod photoresponses in the presence of nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP.",Excluded,0.086117394
4293,"Comparison of patient dose in two-dimensional carotid arteriography and three-dimensional rotational angiography BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is known that interventional neuroradiology (IN) involves high radiation dose to both patients and staff even if performed by trained operators using modern fluoroscopic X-ray equipment and dose-reducing technology. Therefore, every new technology or imaging tool introduced, such as three-dimensional rotational angiography (3D RA), should be evaluated in terms of radiation dose. 3D RA requires a series with a large number of images in comparison with 2D angiography and it is sometimes considered a high-dose IN procedure. The literature is scarce on the 3D RA radiation dose and in particular there are no data on carotid arteriography (CA). The aim of this study was to investigate patient dose differences between 2D and 3D CA.METHODS: The study included 35 patients undergoing 2D CA in hospital 1 and 25 patients undergoing 3D CA in hospital 2. Patient technical data collection included information on the kerma area product (KAP), fluoroscopy time (T), total number of series (S), and total number of acquired images (F).RESULTS: Median KAP was 112 Gy cm(2) and 41 Gy cm(2) for hospitals 1 and 2, respectively, median T was 8.2 min and 5.1 min, median S was 13 and 4, and median F was 247 and 242. Entrance surface air-kerma rate, as measured in ""medium"" fluoroscopy mode measured in 2D acquisition using a 20 cm phantom of polymethylmethacrylate, was 17.3 mGy/min for hospital 1 and 9.2 mGy/min for hospital 2.CONCLUSION: 3D CA allows a substantial reduction in patient radiation dose compared with 2D CA, while providing the necessary diagnostic information.",Excluded,0.08661875

Such lymphomas have been described in only a few case series in the literature. The incidence of this condition is rising with improved survival after organ transplantation. A case of post-transplantation primary central nervous system lymphoma in a young Chinese woman with systemic lupus erythematosus is described here. She presented with right-sided weakness and memory loss after tooth extraction 2 weeks before admission. Contrast computed tomography of the brain demonstrated a contrast rim-enhancing lesion over the left frontal lobe. With a history of recent dental procedure, long-term immunosuppressive therapy and computed tomography findings, cerebral abscess was highly suspected. Emergency operation was performed. Histopathology showed post-transplantation primary central nervous system lymphoma, with cells positive for B-cell marker CD20. Immunosuppressant was stopped and she was treated with radiotherapy and rituximab (anti- CD20 monoclonal antibody). She remained diseasefree at 16 months. Post-transplantation primary central nervous system lymphoma is rare with variable presentation and radiological features. We believe rituximab may have a role in the treatment of such lymphomas.

We report mature outcomes for a cohort of patients with no prior radiation (de novo) treated with 24 Gy in 2 daily fractions, which represents an emerging Canadian standard. Purpose/Objective(s): The cohort consisted of 279 de novo spinal metastases in 145 consecutive patients treated with 24 Gy in 2 SBRT fractions, between 2009 and 2015, identified from a prospective database. All vertebral segments were treated with an institutionally standardized Linac-based approach using cone-beam CT image guidance and six degrees-of-freedom online setup correction. The endpoints were overall survival (OS), local control (LC), and the rate of vertebral compression fractures (VCF). OS rates were obtained using Kaplan-Meier methods and cumulative incidences of LC and VCF were obtained from competing risk analysis using death as a competing risk event. Evaluation of tumor control was based on serial spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as per the SPIne response assessment in Neuro-Oncology (SPINO) criteria recommendations. Result(s): The median follow-up was 17.0 months (range, 0.1-71.6 months). The 1-year and 2-year OS rates were 73.1% and 60.7%, respectively. Presence of epidural disease (P < 0.0001), lung (P = 0.0415) and renal cell (P < 0.0001) primary histologies and diffuse spinal metastatic disease as opposed to oligometastatic disease (P = 0.0034) were significant prognostic factors. The 1-year and 2-year LC rates were 90.3% and 82.4%, respectively, and the median time to local failure (LF) was 9.2 month (range, 0.4-31.3 months). Only the presence of epidural disease predicted for LF (P < 0.0001). The cumulative risk of VCF at 1 and 2 years were 8.5% and 13.8%, respectively. Lytic (P = 0.0143) or mixed lytic/blastic (P = 0.0214) lesions, spinal misalignment (P = 0.0121), and the dose to 90% of the planning target volume (PTVD90) (P = 0.0085) were significant predictors of VCF. Conclusion(s): Twenty-four Gy in 2 daily fractions is safe and effective in achieving high tumor control rates for de novo spinal metastases.

4297,"Behind and beyond the masaoka staging: A 25-year follow-up study of tumor recurrence in completely resected thymic epithelial tumors in a single institution We analyzed prognosticators for recurrence and post-recurrence survival in completely resected thymic epithelial tumors for the past 25 years in a single institution. Between June 1988 and December 2013, 238 patients undergoing intent-to-treat surgery for thymic epithelial tumors were reviewed. Sex, age, myasthenia gravis (MG), tumor histology, Masaoka staging, characteristic of locoregional invasion and recurrence, and the treatment for recurrence were collected. Comparison between groups was conducted using the Student t test and x2 test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors. One hundred sixteen of 135 patients with completely resected thymoma and 35 of 56 patients with thymic carcinoma remained free of recurrence. In patients with completely resected thymoma, Masaoka staging, MG, tumor invasion into the lung, pericardium, and innominate vein or superior vena cava (SVC) invasion were associated with recurrence-free survival in univariate analysis (P=0.004, 0.003, 0.001, 0.007, and 0.039, respectively). In multivariate analysis, MG was the positive independent prognosticator (P=0.039). In patients with completely resected thymic carcinoma, Masaoka staging and innominate vein or SVC invasion were associated with recurrence-free survival in univariate analysis (P=0.045 and 0.005, respectively), whereas innominate vein or SVC invasion was the negative independent prognosticator (P=0.012). In patients with recurrent thymoma, those treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy had a significantly better post-recurrence survival than those undergoing chemoradiotherapy (P=0.029) and those without treatment (P=0.007). Patients with recurrent thymic carcinoma undergoing surgery followed by chemotherapy had a significantly better post-recurrence survival than those without treatment (P=0.004), but not significantly better than those undergoing chemoradiotherapy (P=0.252). In patients with completely resected thymoma, MG was the positive independent prognosticators of recurrence-free survival. Surgery should be attempted for recurrent disease for better post-recurrence survival. In patients with completely resected thymic carcinoma, innominate vein or SVC invasion was the negative independent prognosticator. Surgery for recurrence could be considered since it provided benefit for postrecurrence survival as chemoradiotherapy did. Copyright Â© 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

4298,"Late temporal lobe necrosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: evaluation with combined multi-section diffusion weighted and perfusion weighted MR imaging Late temporal lobe necrosis is a well-known and serious complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) following radiotherapy. Owing to the close proximity to the skull base, the medial temporal lobes are inevitably included in the target volume of irradiation. Patients with NPC provide a unique opportunity in study of delay radiation effect in normal human brain. The objective of this study was to evaluate late temporal lobe radiation injury by combined multi-section diffusion weighted and perfusion weighted MR imaging. We prospectively studied 16 patients with typical clinical symptoms of late temporal lobe necrosis or other abnormalities in the temporal lobes incidentally detected by conventional MR imaging. All patients had a previous history of radiotherapy for histologically proven NPC. Conventional T1- and T2-weighted images, fast gradient echo with echo-planar diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted MR imaging were performed. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) map were computed via commercially available software. MR diffusion and perfusion images were then analyzed and graded by two independent observers with focusing on the diffusion and perfusion mismatch. The temporal lobe lesions displayed marked high diffusion on the ADC map. The rCBV map also revealed marked hypoperfusion in these temporal lobe lesions in all patients. The areas of abnormality on the rCBV map were significantly larger than the lesions on the ADC map in 14 patients (observer 1) and 13 patients (observer 2). Since late temporal lobe necrosis is probably caused by damage of the endothelium of vessels and ischemia, perfusion and diffusion mismatch might imply injured tissue but potentially salvageable brain tissue. A mismatch may be potentially used to predict the response to treatment in-patients with late temporal lobe necrosis.",Excluded,0.15836275
4299,"Chronic pathophysiological changes in normal brain parenchyma raised after radiotherapy can accelerate the recurrence of glioma INTRODUCTION: Tumor recurrence is a leading cause of cancer mortality. Currently, the standard treatment for glioblastoma is maximal surgical resection and concomitant chemoradiation, followed by adjuvant temozolomide therapy. However, this treatment offers a limited benefit, with a median progression-free survival of <7 months and a median overall survival of <15 months. Radiation-induced brain injury occurs in a normal brain following radiotherapy; it is described in terms of acute, early delayed and late delayed injury. The recurrence of glioblastoma usually occurs just around the same time as the early or late delayed phase of radiation injury. Our preliminary investigation has revealed that, at three months after X-ray irradiation, tumor-promoting miRNAs (Mir18a, Mir20a, Mir-92, Mir381, etc.) and cytokines (CCL2, CXCL10, SDF-1, Angpt2, etc.) are significantly up-regulated in the irradiated rat normal brain compared to the non-irradiated one. In the present study, therefore, we hypothesized that the pathophysiological changes in a normal brain parenchyma raised by radiotherapy may engage also in the tumor recurrence after the radiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To explore above hypothesis, we transplanted rat glioblastoma cells (F98) into a rat brain to which X-ray had been irradiated in advance. Group 1: 60 Gy of X-ray was irradiated to right cerebral hemisphere. Group 2: 60 Gy of X-ray was irradiated to left cerebral hemisphere. Group 3: Sham irradiation was performed (control). 3 months after irradiation, 1x105 of F98 cells were stereotactically transplanted into the right cerebral hemisphere of each rat. RESULT(S): Rats in group 1 and 2 showed significantly shorter survival than rats in group 3 (p-value: 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). Interestingly, there was no significant difference of survival between group 1 and group 2 (p=0.8). Histopathological analysis for the tumors revealed that MIB-1 labeling index was significantly higher in group 1 and 2 than in group 3. CONCLUSION(S): It has been reported that, at the tumor recurrence, a lot of mutations including driver ones has been induced and accumulated through chemoradiotherapy, which can promote the tumor regrowth. However, the proliferation capacity of glioblastoma cells significantly increased, even when they were transplanted into the brain previously irradiated. Furthermore, the fact that tumor growth in the non-irradiated cerebral hemisphere of irradiated rats was also accelerated compared to the control group, suggested that some sort of biofactors may spread from irradiated normal brain cells and can make an impact on tumor cells existing in the opposite brain hemisphere. Thus, the delayed radiation injury in normal brain parenchyma might include paradoxical role on the tumor recurrence not only from inside but also from outside the irradiation field.",Included,0.9731363
4300,"A ciliary opsin in the brain of a marine annelid zooplankton is ultraviolet-sensitive, and the sensitivity is tuned by a single amino acid residue Ciliary opsins were classically thought to function only in vertebrates for vision, but they have also been identified recently in invertebrates for non-visual photoreception. Larvae of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii are used as a zooplankton model, and this zooplankton species possesses a ""vertebrate-type"" ciliary opsin (named c-opsin) in the brain. Platynereis c-opsin is suggested to relay light signals for melatonin production and circadian behaviors. Thus, the spectral and biochemical characteristics of this c-opsin would be directly related to non-visual photoreception in this zooplankton model. Here we demonstrate that the c-opsin can sense UV to activate intracellular signaling cascades and that it can directly bind exogenous all-trans-retinal. These results suggest that this c-opsin regulates circadian signaling in a UV-dependent manner and that it does not require a supply of 11-cis-retinal for photoreception. Avoidance of damaging UV irradiation is a major cause of large-scale daily zooplankton movement, and the observed capability of the c-opsin to transmit UV signals and bind all-trans-retinal is ideally suited for sensing UV radiation in the brain, which presumably lacks enzymes producing 11-cis-retinal. Mutagenesis analyses indicated that a unique amino acid residue (Lys-94) is responsible for c-opsin-mediated UV sensing in the Platynereis brain. We therefore propose that acquisition of the lysine residue in the c-opsin would be a critical event in the evolution of Platynereis to enable detection of ambient UV light. In summary, our findings indicate that the c-opsin possesses spectral and biochemical properties suitable for UV sensing by the zooplankton model.",Excluded,0.086161844

4302,"Mental disorders in radiation encephalopathy Chernobyl accident was major nuclear disaster in the history of mankind. Elimination of the consequences required large number of people. Most of them were exposed to the doses of radiation meeting criteria of so-called ""low doses"": 5 - 100 cGy. The impact of these doses on human health is not fully researched; mainly it refers to mental disorders. The purpose of our study was to investigate the clinical and pathological patterns of formation of mental disorders in liquidators exposed to ""low doses"" of radiation because of the Chernobyl accident. A group of 500 liquidators was examined in a continuous research during 1995-1999 and in 2000-2001. Clinical, clinicalpsychological and psychophysiological methods were mainly used; biochemical blood analysis and functional studies also were used. Change in clinical parameters and survey results were observed in the dynamics. Primary morbidity: a separate group of ""cerebrovascular disorders"" was highlighted. In 1989 it accounted for 14 % of primary morbidity, digestive diseases - 9%, and respiratory diseases - 45 %. In 1994, vascular disorders accounted for 43 %, respiratory diseases - 7% , and the digestive diseases - 25; In 1998 cerebral vascular disorders took first place in the primary morbidity, alongside with the increase of combined diverse classes ""neoplasm"", ""endocrine system disorders"" and ""blood diseases"". Disability: In 1990 cerebrovascular disorders occupied 37 % of all cases of disability, in 1993 - 84% of all disability. These disorders consisted of 90% cerebral disorders and had a tendency to deteriorate over time. We have shown that by the year 1998-1999 the psychoorganic syndrome was presented in 65% of liquidators, and in 83% of cases because of the cerebral vascular disorders. The following clinical forms were described: affective (80%), psychopathic (14.8%), and dementic (5.2%). Over time among the liquidators the number of diseases of various organs and systems are increasing. Among these diseases, cerebrovascular disease comes first; organic CNS lesion (radiation encephalopathy) results in clinically detectable psychoorganic syndrome in the major group of examined liquidators.

4306,"Treatment of multifocal intracranial progression of adenocarinoma of the lung with high-dose pulsed erlotinib complicated by hemorrhage and generalized cerebral edema Background: The development of isolated intracranial metastases is increasingly recognized as a relevant clinical problem in patients who respond well to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Single case reports of successful and well-tolerated treatment with high-dose, pulsed erlotinib have been published. (Hata et al, JTO 2011; Dhruva and Socinski, JCO 2009) Methods: We analyze the course of patient who developed intracranial hemorrhage and generalized cerebral edema during treatment with high-dose erlotinib. Result(s): A 44 year old Caucasian female neversmoker presented in 12/08 with left arm weakness. Computed tomography (CT) revealed several brain lesions, and a mass in the right lung. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed metastases in the liver and right kidney. Following bronchoscopic biopsy, adenocarcinoma of the lung, clinical stage IV, was diagnosed. Whole brain irradiation (35 Gy) and three cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin 75mg/ m2 and pemetrexed 500mg/m2 day 1 every 3 weeks) led to a partial response; however, during the fifth cycle a clear progression occurred. A pulmonary embolus was treated with tinzaparin (10,000 I.U. sc od). Genetic analyses showed an activating mutation in EGFR exon 19, and treatment with erlotinib was initiated. This led to regression of all tumor sites, including the kidney. After 13 months of erlotinib, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed progression of the cerebral metastases. The primary tumor and intraabdominal metastases were stable, and so the intracerebral metastases were stereotactiacally irradiated. Three months later one further metastasis was irradiated, however multifocal intracranial progression soon developed. A neurosurgical biopsy showed the same mutation as in the primary tumor, with no known resistance mutations. High dose pulsed erlotinib was added (600 mg q 4d). After 2 weeks hemorrhage into three of the metastases (before hemorrhage: 35x27mm, 11x19mm, 9x8mm) occurred. Anticoagulants were stopped, and due to 6mm midline shift the largest hematoma (35 x 23 mm) was evacuated. MRI showed a trend to partial response in the other intracerebral metastases and so the erlotinib pulses were continued with a 25% dose reduction. Unfortunately, 24 days later, cerebral edema and subdural hygroma developed and the patient died, 24 months after initial diagnosis. Conclusion(s): Brain metastases despite systemic control increasingly pose a problem (Lee et al., Cancer, 2010). Inadequate dosing across the blood brain barrier is one explanation, but has not been proven. The absence of resistance mutations, as well as the multifocal nature of the intracerebral progression, support this theory in our case. The efficacy of high dose erlotinib for brain metastases has been previously reported. Previous reports describe minimal toxicity during treatment. The significant multi-focal hemorrhage and cerebral edema which developed in our patient have not been previously described in this setting. Simultaneous anticoagulation as well as previous stereotactic radiation of the brain metastases may have predisposed our patient to hemorrhage, and may prove to be relative contraindications to high-dose pulsed erlotinib. Because most centers only see a few patients in this clinical situation, cooperative efforts are needed to collect and analyze these cases, and to develop appropriate treatment strategies.",Excluded,0.08605643

The authors retrospectively evaluated the role of the biologically effective dose (BED) after Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for brain AVMs. METHODS A total of 149 consecutive cases of unruptured AVMs treated by upfront GKRS in Lille University Hospital, France, were included. The mean length of follow-up was 52.9 months (median 48, range 12-154 months). The primary outcome was obliteration, and the secondary outcome was complication appearance. The marginal dose was 24 Gy in a vast majority of cases (n = 115, 77.2%; range 18-25 Gy). The mean BED was 220.1 Gy<inf>2.47</inf> (median 229.9, range 106.7-246.8 Gy<inf>2.47</inf>). The mean beam-on time was 32.3 minutes (median 30.8, range 9-138.7 minutes). In the present series, the mean radiation dose rate was 2.259 Gy/min (median 2.176, range 1.313-3.665 Gy/min). The Virginia score was 0 in 29 (19.5%), 1 in 61 (40.9%), 2 in 41 (27.5%), 3 in 18 (12.1%), and 4 in 0 (0%) patients, respectively. The mean Pollock-Flickinger score was 1.11 (median 1.52, range 0.4-2.9). Univariate (for obliteration and complication appearance) and multivariate (for obliteration only) analyses were performed. RESULTS A total of 104 AVMs (69.8%) were obliterated at the last follow-up. The strongest predictor for obliteration was BED (p = 0.03). A radiosurgical obliteration score is proposed, derived from a fitted multivariable model: (0.018 x BED) + (1.58 x V12) + (-0.013689 x beam-on time) + (0.021 x age) - 4.38. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.7438; after internal validation using bootstrap methods, it was 0.7088. No statistically significant relationship between radiation dose rate and obliteration was found (p = 0.29). Twenty-eight (18.8%) patients developed complications after GKRS; 20 (13.4%) of these patients had transient adverse radiological effects (perilesional edema developed). Predictors for complication appearance were higher prescription isodose volume (p = 0.005) and 12-Gy isodose line volume (V12; p = 0.001), higher Pollock-Flickinger (p = 0.02) and Virginia scores (p = 0.003), and lower beam-on time (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS The BED was the strongest predictor of obliteration of unruptured AVMs after upfront GKRS. A radiosurgical score comprising the BED is proposed. The V12 appears as a predictor for both efficacy and toxicity. Beam-on time was illustrated as statistically significant for both obliteration and complication appearance. The radiation dose rate did not influence obliteration in the current analysis. The exact BED threshold remains to be established by further studies.

4308,"Tm:fiber laser ablation with real-time temperature monitoring for minimizing collateral thermal damage: ex vivo dosimetry for ovine brain BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The thermal damage of the surrounding tissue can be an unwanted result of continuous-wave laser irradiations. In order to propose an effective alternative to conventional surgical techniques, photothermal damage must be taken under control by a detailed dose study. Real-time temperature monitoring can be also an effective way to get rid of these negative effects. The aim of the present study is to investigate the potential of a new laser-thermoprobe, which consists of a continuous-wave 1,940-nm Tm:fiber laser and a thermocouple measurement system for brain surgery in an ex vivo study.STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: A laser-thermoprobe was designed for using the near-by tissue temperature as a real-time reference for the applicator. Fresh lamb brain tissues were used for experiments. 320 laser shots were performed on both cortical and subcortical tissue.RESULTS: The relationship between laser parameters, temperature changes, and ablation (removal of tissue) efficiency was determined. The correlation between rate of temperature change and ablation efficiency was calculated.CONCLUSION: Laser-thermoprobe leads us to understand the basic laser-tissue interaction mechanism in a very cheap and easy way, without making a change in the experimental design. It was also shown that the ablation and coagulation (thermally irreversible damage) diameters could be predicted, and carbonization can be avoided by temperature monitoring.",Excluded,0.08558557

4310,"Specificity in the response of the mammalian methylome to ionizing radiation Environmental epigenetics is the study of how exposures interact with the epigenome to cause stable epigenetic change, most notably changes in DNA methylation patterns. Here we asked whether the response of the mouse epigenome to ionizing radiation is specific or non-specific. We used meDIP-seq to examine radiation-induced changes in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) throughout the genome. To examine tissue specificity, we compared the methylomes of heart and brain tissue 22 weeks after exposure to protons. We found 5mC and 5hmC changes that mapped to genes with cardiovascular functions in the heart and with neuronal functions in the brain. We also compared two forms of ionizing radiation, the sparsely ionizing protons and densely ionizing 56Fe ions. Both are components of galactic cosmic radiation, which is a concern for astronauts flying deep space missions. Specifically, we asked whether protons and 56Fe ions would produce similar DNA methylation changes in the brain at 4 weeks post exposure, and found significant overlap for both 5mC and 5hmC changes. Interestingly, gene expression changes in the brain at 4 weeks were linked to changes in 5hmC at promoter regions, but not 5mC, and these linked changes mapped to neuronal ontology pathways. Further, a novel form of 5hmC change along gene bodies was observed and mapped mostly to postsynaptic pathways. Finally, the extent of 56Fe ion-induced behavioral change correlated inversely with DNA methylation change suggesting that the epigenomic response to radiation was part of the repair process to mitigate its toxic effects.",Included,0.97868687
4311,"Limited stage small cell lung cancer: treatment and therapy Chemotherapy remains the key treatment for small cell lung cancer; today, that chemotherapy remains cisplatin and etoposide in a variety of acceptable schedules. Attempts to use new drugs in extensive disease have not been as successful as hoped; however, a recent trial from Japan supports the use of irinotecan and cisplatin over the standard cisplatin and etoposide, but these facts need to be verified in western countries. For limited disease, the addition of thoracic radiotherapy for all patients and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in complete, or near complete, responders have resulted in improved survival. The best results occur with early, intensive thoracic radiotherapy concurrent with chemotherapy and PCI after completion of systemic and local therapy. The use of PCI and thoracic radiotherapy in extensive disease is more controversial and less evidence based. PCI and thoracic radiotherapy may be considered only in patients who have achieved a ""systemic"" complete response and excellent response in the chest. However, both prospects should be supported if there is complete response systemically and near complete response locally.

4312,"Does the radioactive iodine dose affect smell, taste sensation and nose function? OBJECTIVE: To detect whether the adverse effects of post-operative radioactive iodine therapy following differentiated thyroid cancer on smell, taste and nasal functions were associated with radioactive iodine dose.METHODS: Fifty-one patients who had undergone total thyroidectomy because of differentiated thyroid cancer were divided into two groups depending on the post-operative radioactive iodine therapy dose: low dose group (50 mCi; 21 patients) and high dose group (100-150 mCi; 30 patients). The Sniffin' Sticks smell test, the Taste Strips test and the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test were performed on all patients one week before therapy, and at two months and one year following therapy.RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were detected in the Sniffin' Sticks test results, total odour scores, total taste scores and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test results between the assessment time points. There was no statistically significant difference between the low and high dose groups in terms of odour, taste or Sino-Nasal Outcome Test scores either before or after therapy.CONCLUSION: Radioactive iodine therapy has some short- and long-term adverse effects on nasal functions and taste and odour sensations, which affect quality of life.

Because extended exposure to visible light can be toxic to cells, it is important to characterize the effects of light stimulation on cellular function in the absence of optogenetic proteins. Here we exposed mouse cortical cultures with no exogenous optogenetic proteins to several hours of flashing blue, red, or green light. We found that exposing these cultures to as short as 1 h of blue light, but not red or green light, results in an increase in the expression of neuronal activity-regulated genes.

4315,"Spherical aberration and glare disability with intraocular lenses of different optical design We implanted several kinds of intraocular lenses (IOLs), calculated the spherical aberration using a computed ray-tracing system, and investigated the correlation between glare disability and spherical aberration and the difference in glare disability among the different IOL types. Type A IOLs (convex-plano), except for those with high power, had the smallest spherical aberration. Type B IOLs (biconvex, anterior more curved) had the smallest spherical aberration at high power. Type D IOLs (biconvex, posterior more curved) had the largest spherical aberration. The correlation between glare disability and spherical aberration was statistically significant for types A, B and C (equiconvex) IOLs. There was no correlation between glare disability and spherical aberration for Type D IOLs, although they showed the smallest glare disability of the four types. These results indicate that the spherical aberration of an IOL, which is calculated by an optical design program, may be a good criterion for selecting an IOL design.",Excluded,0.0868366
4316,"Development of radiolabeled molecular imaging probes for in vivo analysis of biological function. [Japanese] Molecular imaging is a newly emerging field aimed at advancing our understanding of biology and medicine through the noninvasive in vivo investigation of cellular molecular events involved in normal and pathologic processes. In this field, researchers and/or clinicians are combining modern tools of molecular and cell biology with state of the art technology in order to noninvasively image living subjects. Various imaging modalities such as optics (fluorescence and luminescence), nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and radiation are being used to visually capture and study molecular and cellular events in living organisms. Among these modalities, nuclear medical molecular imaging uses radionuclides [i.e., positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)], and has characteristic properties that allow researchers and/or clinicians to obtain functional images of living subjects with high sensitivity. Translational molecular imaging, a research step between animal experiments and the clinical setting, has been successful when using nuclear medical molecular imaging. This approach leads to better methods for studying biological processes, as well as for diagnosing and managing diseases. In this review, two topics associated with our research on nuclear medical molecular imaging are summarized: (1) the development of a nuclear medical molecular imaging probe that targets cerebral nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), and the translational molecular imaging research conducted using this nAChR imaging probe; and (2) the development of oxygen-dependent degradable nuclear medical molecular imaging probes that target hypoxia-inducible factor-1-active tumor microenvironments.

4317,"Spreading depression elicited by thermal effects of ultrasonic irradiation of cerebral cortex in rats Cortical spreading depression (CSD) was elicited by focused ultrasonic irradiation (800 kHz) of exposed cerebral cortex in anesthetized rats. With the acoustic output of 0.64 W at the probe-tissue contact (3 mm in diameter), CSD was elicited after 28-sec irradiation in normothermic rats. Reduction of cortical temperature to 31 degrees C increased the threshold irradiation time to 82 sec on the average. Ten- to thirty-sec heating of cerebral cortex with a thermode elicited CSD when surface temperature exceeded 47 degrees C. Histological examination of the cortical areas exposed to threshold irradiation revealed a central coagulation lesion surrounded by edema. It is concluded that the ultrasonic irradiation elicits CSD by dissipated heat. Differences in threshold duration of irradiation in hypothermic and normothermic rats were used to compute the threshold temperature which had to be exceeded in the critical volume of cortex in order to start CSD.",Excluded,0.08624737
4318,"Dosimetric performance of two linear accelerator-based radiosurgery systems to treat single and multiplebrain metastases OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the dosimetric plan quality for noncoplanar volumetric arc therapy of single and multiple brain metastases using the linear accelerator-based radiosurgery system HyperArc and a robotic radiosurgery system.METHODS: 31 tumors from 24 patients were treated by stereotactic radiosurgery using the CyberKnife system. CT images, structure sets, and dose files were transferred to the Eclipse treatment planning system for the HyperArc system. Dosimetric parameters for both plans were compared. The beam-on time was calculated from the total monitor unit and dose rate.RESULTS: For normal brain tissue, the received volume doses were significantly lower for HyperArc than for CyberKnife_G4 and strongly correlated with the planning target volume (PTV) for cases of single brain metastasis. In addition, the difference in volume dose between CyberKnife_G4 and HyperArc was proportional to the PTV. For multiple brain metastases, no significant difference was observed between the two stereotactic radiosurgery systems, except for high-dose region in the normal tissue. In low dose for brain minus PTV, when the maximum distance among each target was above 8.0 cm, HyperArc delivered higher dose than CyberKnife_G4. The mean +/- SDs for the beam-on time were 15.8 +/- 5.3 and 5.6 +/- 0.8 min for CyberKnife_G4 and HyperArc, respectively (p < .01).CONCLUSION: HyperArc is best suited for larger targets in single brain metastasis and for smaller inter tumor tumor distances in multiple brain metastases.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The performance of HyperArc in comparison with CyberKnife_G4 was depended on defined margin and tumor distances.",Excluded,0.08672555

A median dose was 60 Gy. Concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy were administered to 111 patients. MIB-1 LI was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Recurrence patterns were categorized according to the areas of recurrence as follows: central failure (recurrence in the 95% of 60 Gy); in-field (recurrence in the high-dose volume of 50 Gy; marginal (recurrence outside the high-dose volume) and distant (recurrence outside the RT field). Result(s): The median follow-up durations were 13 months for all patients and 19 months for those remaining alive. Among AA patients, the 2-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 23.1% and 39.2%, respectively, while in GB patients, the rates were 13.3% and 27.6%, respectively. The median survival time was 20 months for AA patients and 15 months for GB patients. Among AA patients, recurrences were central in 68.7% of patients; in-field, 18.8%; and distant, 12.5%, while among GB patients, 69.0% of recurrences were central, 15.5% were in-field, 12.1% were marginal, and 3.4% were distant. The MIB-1 LI medians were 18.2% in AA and 29.8% in GB. Interestingly, in patients with GB, the MIB-1 LI had a strong effect on the pattern of failure (P = 0.014), while the extent of surgical removal (P = 0.47) and regimens of chemotherapy (P = 0.57) did not. Conclusion(s): MIB-1 LI predominantly affected the pattern of failure in GB patients treated with a multimodal approach, and it might be a useful tool for the management of the disease.

4320,"Preconditioning-induced protection of photoreceptors requires activation of the signal-transducing receptor gp130 in photoreceptors Retinal degenerations are a class of neurodegenerative disorders that ultimately lead to blindness due to the death of retinal photoreceptors. In most cases, death is the result of long-term exposure to environmental, inflammatory, and genetic insults. In age-related macular degeneration, significant vision loss may take up to 70-80 years to develop. The protracted time to develop blindness suggests that retinal neurons have an endogenous mechanism for protection from chronic injury. Previous studies have shown that endogenous protective mechanisms can be induced by preconditioning animals with sublethal bright cyclic light. Such preconditioning can protect photoreceptors from a subsequent damaging insult and is thought to be accomplished through induced expression of protective factors. Some of the factors shown to be associated with protection bind and activate the signal transducing receptor gp130. To determine whether stress-induced endogenous protection of photoreceptors requires gp130, we generated conditional gp130 knockout (KO) mice with the Cre/lox system and used light-preconditioning to induce neuroprotection in these mice. Functional and morphological analyses demonstrated that the retina-specific gp130 KO impaired preconditioning-induced endogenous protection. Photoreceptor-specific gp130 KO mice had reduced protection, although the Muller cell KO mice did not, thus gp130-induced protection was restricted to photoreceptors. Using an animal model of retinitis pigmentosa, we found that the photoreceptor-specific gp130 KO increased sensitivity to genetically induced photoreceptor cell death, demonstrating that gp130 activation in photoreceptors had a general protective role independent of whether stress was caused by light or genetic mutations.",Excluded,0.08627768
4321,"Focal, high dose, and fractionated modified stereotactic radiation therapy for lung carcinoma patients: a preliminary experience BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiation therapy is highly effective in the treatment of small brain metastases, regardless of the histology. This suggests that small extracranial malignancies may be curable with similar radiation therapy. The authors developed a novel treatment unit for administering such therapy.METHODS: The unit consisted of a linear accelerator (linac), an X-ray simulator (X-S), computed tomography (CT), and a table. The gantry axes of the three machines were coaxial and could be matched by rotating the table. Patients were instructed to perform shallow respiration with oxygen. The motion of the tumor was monitored with the X-S. When the motion was slight enough, the table was rotated to the CT. To include all geometric movement on the CT images, each scan was made while the patient was performing shallow respiration. After the CT positioning, the table was rotated to the linac, and non-coplanar treatment was given. Beginning in October 1994, 45 patients with 23 primary or 43 metastatic lung carcinomas were treated. Radiation doses at the 80% isodose line were 30-75 gray in 5-15 fractions over 1-3 weeks with or without conventional radiation therapy.RESULTS: The treatment was performed with no or minimal adverse acute symptoms. The daily treatment time was short. During a median follow-up of 11 months, local progression occurred in 2 of 66 lesions. Interstitial changes in the lung were limited.CONCLUSIONS: With this unit and procedure, focal radiation therapy similar to stereotactic radiation therapy is possible for extracranial sites.

4322,"Cranial diameter pulsations measured by non-invasive ultrasound decrease with tilt INTRODUCTION: Intracranial pressure (ICP) may play a significant role in physiological responses to microgravity by contributing to the nausea associated with microgravity exposure. However, effects of altered gravity on ICP in astronauts have not been investigated, primarily due to the invasiveness of currently available techniques. We have developed an ultrasonic device that monitors changes in cranial diameter pulsation non-invasively so that we can evaluate ICP dynamics in astronauts during spaceflight. This study was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of our ultrasound technique under the physiological condition in which ICP dynamics are changed due to altered gravitational force.METHODS: Six healthy volunteers were placed at 60 degrees head-up, 30 degrees headup, supine, and 15 degrees head-down positions for 3 min at each angle. We measured arterial blood pressure (ABP) with a finger pressure cuff, and cranial diameter pulsation with a pulsed phase lock loop device (PPLL).RESULTS: Analysis of covariance demonstrated that amplitudes of cranial diameter pulsations were significantly altered with the angle of tilt (p < 0.001). The 95% confidence interval for linear regression coefficients of the cranial diameter pulsation amplitudes with tilt angle was 0.862 to 0.968. However, ABP amplitudes did not show this relationship.DISCUSSION: Our noninvasive ultrasonic technique reveals that the amplitude of cranial diameter pulsation decreases as a function of tilt angle, suggesting that ICP pulsation follows the same relationship. It is demonstrated that the PPLL device has a sufficient sensitivity to detect changes non-invasively in ICP pulsation caused by altered gravity.",Excluded,0.086214155
4323,"Intense physiological light upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor and enhances choroidal neovascularization via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha in mice OBJECTIVE: Toxicity of intense light to facilitate the development of neovascular age-related macular degeneration has been a health concern although the mechanism remains unclear.METHODS AND RESULTS: Effects of intense, but within physiological range, light on retinal pigment epithelium, a major pathogenic origin of age-related macular degeneration were studied in mice. Intense physiological light upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in retinal pigment epithelium, independent of circadian rhythm, which resulted in enhancement of choroidal neovascularization. In rd1/rd1 mice or Crx(-/-) mice that do not possess outer segment structure, light exposure did not induce VEGF, indicating that VEGF upregulation by light depended on increased outer segment phagocytosis by retinal pigment epithelium. In retinal pigment epithelium cells phagocytosing increased amount of outer segment, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) not hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha was induced, leading to VEGF upregulation. The VEGF upregulation and choroidal neovascularization enhancement were abrogated in PGC-1alpha(-/-) mice and estrogen-related receptor-alpha(-/-) mice, indicating the involvement of PGC-1alpha/estrogen-related receptor-alpha pathway.CONCLUSIONS: Intense physiological light is involved in choroidal neovascularization through excess outer segment phagocytosis and VEGF upregulation mediated by PGC-1alpha in vivo.",Excluded,0.086136766

In a mouse model, tumor and critical organ-absorbed doses delivered by different radioimmunoconjugates were calculated and compared. We used a Medical Internal Radiation Dosimetry (MIRD)-style mouse dosimetry model that incorporates cross-organ beta doses to make refined estimates of the radiation absorbed dose to tissues. Biodistribution data from neuroblastoma xenografted nude mice were used to estimate tumor, organ and bone marrow absorbed dose values for 90Y-3F8, 131I-3F8 and 131I-F(ab')2 fragments. Immunoreactive fractions of the radiolabeled antibodies were comparable. Although tumor uptake of the radioiodinated and radiometal labeled 3F8 was much higher than that of the radioiodinated F(ab')2 fragments (maximum percent injected dose per gram values were 39.4, 33.2 and 20.1 for 131I-3F8, 90Y-3F8 and 131I-F(ab')2, respectively), tumor to nontumor ratios were higher for radioiodinated fragments (with the exception of tumor to kidney ratio). For the minimum tumor dose necessary for complete ablation, the bone marrow received 195, 278 and 401 cGy for 131I-F(ab')2, 131I-3F8 and 90Y-3F8, respectively.

Background(s): AE is a chronic and lethal parasitic infection caused by the helminth echinococcus multilocularis (EM). The disease is endemic in Turkey particularly in the Eastern Anatolia Region. Cysts of AE may involve lots of organs like lung, spleen, kidneys, heart, bone and brain and imitate a malign tumor. Method(s): A 31 years old male patient was admitted to our clinic due ataxi and seizures. Neurological examination revealed mildly impaired orientation and mentation, hemiparesis on right extremites and bilateral extensor Babinski sign. We have learned from his medical history he has been diagnosed as metastases of the lung and brain originating from the primary liver malignancy using PET-CT imaging and brain metastases have been treated by radiation theraphy recently. MR examination of brain demonstrated well-defined round hypointense lesions on T1-weighted images and hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images on the parietal, occipital, frontal, temporal and cerebellar regions of the brain. Surrounding oedema and ringshaped contrast enhancement were seen the walls of the cystic lesions. The results of an indirect echinococcal hemagglutination test were positive.

4332,"Cerebromicrovascular dysfunction predicts cognitive decline and gait abnormalities in a mouse model of whole brain irradiation-induced accelerated brain senescence Whole brain irradiation (WBI) is a mainstream therapy for patients with both identifiable brain metastases and prophylaxis for microscopic malignancies. However, it also promotes accelerated senescence in healthy tissues and leads to progressive cognitive dysfunction in up to 50% of tumor patients surviving long term after treatment, due to gamma-irradiation-induced cerebromicrovascular injury. Moment-to-moment adjustment of cerebral blood flow (CBF) via neuronal activity-dependent cerebromicrovascular dilation (functional hyperemia) has a critical role in maintenance of healthy cognitive function. To determine whether cognitive decline induced by WBI associates with impaired cerebromicrovascular function, C56BL/6 mice (3 months) subjected to a clinically relevant protocol of fractionated WBI (5 Gy twice weekly for 4 weeks) and control mice were compared. Mice were tested for spatial memory performance (radial arm water maze), sensorimotor coordination (computerized gait analysis, CatWalk), and cerebromicrovascular function (whisker-stimulation-induced increases in CBF, measured by laser Doppler flowmetry) at 3 to 6 months post-irradiation. We found that mice with WBI exhibited impaired cerebromicrovascular function at 3 months post-irradiation, which was associated with impaired performance in the radial arm water maze. At 6 months, post-irradiation progressive impairment in gait coordination (including changes in the regularity index and phase dispersion) was also evident. Collectively, our findings provide evidence for early and persisting neurovascular impairment after a clinically relevant protocol of fractionated WBI, which predict early manifestations of cognitive impairment.",Included,0.9843556

Between March 2008 and August 2009, 10 patients were treated with SRT boost using CyberKnife system due mainly to unfavorable condition such as tumors in close proximity to serial organs or former radiotherapy fields. Treatment sites were the external auditory canal in two, the nasopharynx in one, the oropharynx in three, the nasal cavity in one, the maxillary sinus in two, and the oligometastatic cervical lymph node in one. All patients underwent preceding conventional radiotherapy of 40 to 60 Gy. Dose and fractionation scheme of the Cyberknife SRT boost was individualized, and prescribed dose ranged from 9 Gy to 16 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions. Among four patients for whom dose to the optic pathway was concerned, the maximum dose was only about 3 Gy for three patients whereas 9.6 Gy in the remaining one patient. The maximum dose for the mandible in one of three patients with oropharyngeal cancer was 19.7 Gy, whereas majority of the bone can be spared by using non-isocentric conformal beams. For a patient with nasopharyngeal cancer, the highest dose in the brain stem was 15 Gy. However, majority of the brain stem received less than 40% of the maximum dose.

4334,"Edaravone protects ovaries from radiation-induced apoptosis Objective: Ovaries are very sensitive and prone to radiation-related damage. Radiation impairs the ovaries by triggering apoptosis of follicular cells and chromosomal damage and oxidative stress. Edaravone is a potent free radical scavenger, which has been clinically used to treat the neuronal damage following acute ischemic stroke. Our purpose is to evaluate the protective effects of edaravone and to investigate the histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in rat ovaries after radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty two Wistar albino female rats were randomly divided into four groups. 1: control group, 2: sham group (only radiation), 3: 450 mg/kg edaravone and radiation group, 4: 45 mg/kg edaravone and radiation group. Four days after radiation exposure, the rats were sacrificed and the ovaries were removed. Histologic changes under light microscopy and immunoreactivity for anticaspase-3 were noted and compared between the four groups. Result(s): There was a statistically significant difference in follicle counts, vascular congestion, edema, cytoplasmic vacuolization and interstitial cell degeneration between the groups. Radiation causes deterioration of histopathological parameters. Administration of edaravone at different doses seems to reverse these alterations and alleviate the injury. Antioxidant defense mechanisms appear to be enhanced by edaravone. Conclusion(s): This is the first study evaluating the protective effects of edaravone on radiation-induced ovarian damage. Edaravone decreased the follicule apoptosis and attenuates ovarian damage induced radiation in rats.",Included,0.9760873

4338,"Clinical Evaluation of a Rotational Set-up Correction Device for Multiple Brain Metastases Using Single-Isocenter Stereotactic Radiation Therapy Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) using a single plan with one isocenter by helical tomotherapy (HT) can simultaneously treat multiple brain metastases with highly conformal dose distributions. This may reduce treatment time and intra-fractional motion. However, rotational set-up errors in the pitch and yaw angles cannot be corrected in the HT system. Therefore, increases in rotational set-up error and distance of the target-to-rotational-center may be associated with significant dosimetric uncertainties with this irradiation technique. Previous research shows that when rotational errors are increased to 2.0degree, the prescription doses which cover 95% of the planning target volume were only 63% of all tested cases. Here, we developed a new head supporting device that allows for a highly-accurate correction of rotational errors during image-guided radiation therapy. In this study, we investigated the amounts of rotational correction required prior to irradiation, and evaluated the dosimetric efficacy of rotational correction for SRT, using HT unit to treat multiple brain metastases. Materials/Methods: A novel rotational set-up correction device was constructed from carbon material and conjected with the commonly-used head shell system on the top of our device. We were able to rotate in 0.1degree increments for pitch and yaw angles using two screws. We retrospectively analyzed data from three patients irradiated by single-isocenter SRT for multiple brain metastases using the HT unit. The SRT plans were created with 30 Gy in three fractions prescribed for D99% to clinical target volumes. The required rotational correction values were determined by mega-voltage computed tomography (MVCT) before irradiation. Residual correction values were quantified after correction by the developed device. Moreover, dosimetric efficacy was evaluated using the calculated dose distribution with MVCT after rotational correction. Dose distribution was compared between 4D (three horizontal axes + roll) and 6D correction. We clarified efficacy of rotational correction depending on the distance of the target-to-rotational-center. Result(s): The rotational correction for pitch was 1.2degree +/- 1.7degree, roll: 0.9degree +/- 1.2degree, and yaw: 1.3degree +/- 1.6degree. The maximum correction value in pitch and yaw was 3.0degree. The residual correction value after rotational correction was 0.2degree +/- 0.3degree in both pitch and yaw angles. The difference in target dose between 4D and 6D corrections was improved by 2.5% in coverage index, and 1.0% on D99%. Dosimetric efficacy of rotational correction did not depend on the distance of the target-to-rotational-center. This suggests that irradiated doses for brain metastases in any location can be improved. Conclusion(s): Novel rotational set-up correction device can be corrected to within 0.5degree in pitch and yaw angle error, and benefited rotational correction and irradiated dose distribution for single-isocenter SRT for multiple brain metastases.

4339,"Non-coplanar volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for craniopharyngiomas reduces radiation doses to the bilateral hippocampus: a planning study comparing dynamic conformal arc therapy, coplanar VMAT, and non-coplanar VMAT BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that radiation-induced injuries to the hippocampus play important roles in compromising neurocognitive functioning for patients with brain tumors and it could be important to spare the hippocampus using modern planning methods for patients with craniopharyngiomas. As bilateral hippocampus are located on the same level as the planning target volume (PTV) in patients with craniopharyngioma, it seems possible to reduce doses to hippocampus using non-coplanar beams. While the use of non-coplanar beams in volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) of malignant intracranial tumors has recently been reported, no dosimetric comparison has yet been made between VMAT using non-coplanar arcs (ncVMAT) and VMAT employing only coplanar arcs (coVMAT) among patients with craniopharyngiomas. We performed a planning study comparing dose distributions to the PTV, hippocampus, and other organs at risk (OAR) of dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCAT), coVMAT, and ncVMAT.METHODS: DCAT, coVMAT, and ncVMAT plans were created for 10 patients with craniopharyngiomas. The prescription dose was 52.2 Gy in 29 fractions, and 99 % of each PTV was covered by 90 % of the prescribed dose. The maximum dose was held below 107 % of the prescribed dose. CoVMAT and ncVMAT plans were formulated to satisfy the following criteria: the doses to the hippocampus were minimized, and the doses to the OAR were similar to or lower than those of DCAT.RESULTS: The mean equivalent doses in 2-Gy fractions to 40 % of the volumes of the bilateral hippocampus [EQD2(40%hippos)] were 15.4/10.8/6.5 Gy for DCAT/coVMAT/ncVMAT, respectively. The EQD2(40%hippos) for ncVMAT were <7.3 Gy, which is the threshold predicting cognitive impairment, as defined by Gondi et al.. The mean doses to normal brain tissue and the conformity indices were similar for the three plans, and the homogeneity indices were significantly better for coVMAT and ncVMAT compared with DCAT.CONCLUSIONS: NcVMAT is more appropriate than DCAT and coVMAT for patients with craniopharyngiomas. NcVMAT significantly reduces radiation doses to the bilateral hippocampus (to 50 % that of the DCAT) without increasing the doses to normal brain tissue and other OAR.",Excluded,0.086923994
4340,"Dosimetric comparison between dual-isocentric dynamic conformal arc therapy and mono-isocentric volumetric-modulated arc therapy for two large brain metastases Mono-isocentric volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) can be used to treat multiple brain metastases. It remains unknown whether mono-isocentric VMAT can improve the dose distribution compared with dual-isocentric dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCAT), especially for two brain metastases. We compared the dose distribution between dual-isocentric DCAT and mono-isocentric VMAT for two large brain metastases, and analyzed the relationship between the distance between the two targets and the difference in dose distribution. A total of 19 patients, each with two large brain metastases, were enrolled. The dose prescribed for each planning target volume (PTV) was 28 Gy in five fractions (D99.8 = 100%). We created new indices derived from conformity indices suggested by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG; mRTOG-CI) and Paddick et al. (mIP-CI), using the dosimetric parameters of the sum of the two PTVs. The median PTV was 5.05 cm3 (range, 2.10-28.47). VMAT significantly improved mRTOG-CI and mIP-CI compared with DCAT. In all cases, VMAT was able to improve mRTOG-CI and mIP-CI compared with DCAT. Whereas the normal brain volume receiving 5 Gy was similar between the two modalities, the normal brain receiving 10, 12, 15, 20, 25 and 28 Gy (V10-V28) was significantly smaller in VMAT. The mean beam-on times were 213.3 s and 121.9 s in DCAT and VMAT, respectively (P < 0.001). Mono-isocentric VMAT improved the target conformity and reduced the beam-on time and V10-V28 of the normal brain for not only two close metastases but also two distant metastases. Mono-isocentric VMAT seems to be a promising treatment technique for two large brain metastases.",Excluded,0.08615471
4341,"Biophysical properties of the synucleins and their propensities to fibrillate: inhibition of alpha-synuclein assembly by beta- and gamma-synucleins The pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the presence of intracellular inclusions, Lewy bodies, and Lewy neurites, in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and several other brain regions. Filamentous alpha-synuclein is the major component of these deposits and its aggregation is believed to play an important role in Parkinson's disease and several other neurodegenerative diseases. Two homologous proteins, beta- and gamma-synucleins, are also abundant in the brain. The synucleins are natively unfolded proteins. beta-Synuclein, which lacks 11 central hydrophobic residues compared with its homologs, exhibited the properties of a random coil, whereas alpha- and gamma-synucleins were slightly more compact and structured. gamma-Synuclein, unlike its homologs, formed a soluble oligomer at relatively low concentrations, which appears to be an off-fibrillation pathway species. Here we show that, although they have similar biophysical properties to alpha-synuclein, beta- And gamma-synucleins inhibit alpha-synuclein fibril formation. Complete inhibition of alpha-synuclein fibrillation was observed at 4:1 molar excess of beta- and gamma-synucleins. No significant incorporation of beta-synuclein into the fibrils was detected. The lack of fibrils formed by beta-synuclein is most readily explained by the absence of a stretch of hydrophobic residues from the middle region of the protein. A model for the inhibition is proposed.",Excluded,0.08597141
4342,"Death of neurons and glial cells, induced by a photodynamic injury: signaling processes and neurone-glial interactions.

Neuron responses: firing stimulation at high photosensitizer concentrations and inhibition at low concentrations (< 10(-7) M) that were followed by necrosis, are described. Glial cells died from both necrosis and apoptosis. Local laser inactivation of a neuron enhanced PD-induced apoptosis of glial cells, thus indicating that neuron maintained the survival of glia. Inter- and intracellular signaling mediated photodamage of these cells. Using inhibitors or activators of signaling proteins, the involvement of Ca(2+)-, adenylate cyclase- and tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling pathways in responses of neurons and glial cells to photosensitization was shown.

4346,"Robustness of neural coding in Drosophila photoreceptors in the absence of slow delayed rectifier K+ channels Determining the contribution of a single type of ion channel to information processing within a neuron requires not only knowledge of the properties of the channel but also understanding of its function within a complex system. We studied the contribution of slow delayed rectifier K+ channels to neural coding in Drosophila photoreceptors by combining genetic and electrophysiological approaches with biophysical modeling. We show that the Shab gene encodes the slow delayed rectifier K+ channel and identify a novel voltage-gated K+ conductance. Analysis of the in vivo recorded voltage responses together with their computer-simulated counterparts demonstrates that Shab channels in Drosophila photoreceptors attenuate the light-induced depolarization and prevent response saturation in bright light. We also show that reduction of the Shab conductance in mutant photoreceptors is accompanied by a proportional drop in their input resistance. This reduction in input resistance partially restores the signaling range, sensitivity, and dynamic coding of light intensities of Shab photoreceptors to those of the wild-type counterparts. However, loss of the Shab channels may affect both the energy efficiency of coding and the processing of natural stimuli. Our results highlight the role of different types of voltage-gated K+ channels in the performance of the photoreceptors and provide insight into functional robustness against the perturbation of specific ion channel composition.",Excluded,0.08591103

One process which might contribute to rapid termination of the responses to Ins 1,4,5-P3 and to light is the hydrolysis of Ins 1,4,5-P3 by an InsP3-5-phosphatase to form inositol 1,4-bisphosphate. Inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins 2,4,5-P3) is known to be less hydrolysable by the InsP3-5-phosphatase than is Ins 1,4,5-P3. Whereas ventral photoreceptors respond to an injection of Ins 1,4,5-P3 with a single wave of depolarization, the response to Ins 2,4,5-P3 is a burst of waves of depolarization. Our hypothesis is that it is the resistance to hydrolysis by the InsP3-5-phosphatase which accounts for the burst of waves produced by Ins 2,4,5-P3. To test this idea we injected ventral photoreceptors with Ins 1,4,5-P3 in the presence of the non-specific phosphatase inhibitors, vanadate and fluoride, which prolong the response to a flash of light in ventral photoreceptors (D.W. Corson, A. Fein, W.W. Walthall, J. Gen. Physiol. 82 (1983) 659-677). In the presence of fluoride or vanadate the response to Ins 1,4,5-P3 was composed of a burst of waves rather than a single wave of depolarization.

The aim of this study is to report our experience on feasibility and toxicity of carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in previously irradiated patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Between August 2014 and February 2017, a total of 10 patients (M:F= 8:2) were treated with CIRT as re-irradiation for locally recurrent rectal cancer at National Centre of Oncological Hadrontherapy (CNAO). Patient ages ranged between 46 to 78 years (median 58.5 years). All patients had a history of surgery and pelvic radiotherapy. Specifically, the dose of previous radiotherapy ranged from 45 to 50.4 Gy in 9 patients one of which received a brachytherapy boost up to a total dose of 20Gy. One patient was irradiated with a total dose of 76 Gy for a prostatic cancer. One patient, at time of the first recurrence, underwent to re-irradiation with stereotactic radiotherapy (30 Gy in 6 fractions). They had 7 presacral, 1 perineal, 1 perianal and 1 pre-coccygeal relapses. Three patients received spacer implantation prior to CIRT to secure adequate distance between bowel and tumor.

Median total dose of CIRT was 60 GyRBE (range: 35-76.8) and was administered in a median number of 16 fractions (range: 15-20) over 4 weeks (from 3 to 4.8 Gy RBE/fraction). The GTV ranged from 7.21 to 300.8 cm<sup>3</sup> with a median of 28.42 cm<sup>3</sup>. The PTV ranged from 53.55 to 742.64 cm<sup>3</sup>. All patients completed the scheduled treatment course. Median follow-up was 13 months. Acute toxicity was mild and mainly neuropathic: grade 2 (G2) neuropathic pain in 1 (10%) and G1 in 2 (20%) patients. The major late toxicities were peripheral neuropathy (20%, G2). No G>=3 acute/late reaction nor pelvic infections were observed. Four patients were diagnosed with local progression after carbon ion radiotherapy with a median disease free survival of 11.4 months (range: 2.4- 39.7).

The effect of this exposure to alkali on the DNA size distribution was determined by comparing the DNA filter elution profiles obtained experimentally with those theoretically predicted for monodispersed and random distributions. At pH 12.3 or 12.9, DNA from cells irradiated with 300 rad eluted with first-order kinetics corresponding to a random DNA size distribution. The median size of the distribution decreased if the irradiated DNA was exposed to pH 12.3 for 24 h. At pH 12.3 or 12.9, DNA from unirradiated cells eluted initially with complex kinetics that later became linear (18-21 h for pH 12.3 or 13-15 h for pH 12.9), characteristic of a monodispersed DNA size distribution. Holding either unirradiated or irradiated DNA at pH 11.0, below the critical unwinding pH, produced no effect on the elution profiles. Analysis of these filter elution data indicated that after sufficient exposure to pH 12.3 or 12.9, undamaged DNA molecules from mammalian cells elute as a single-stranded monodispersed size distribution of approximately 1 X 10(10) daltons. While the possibility cannot be completely eliminated that this monodispersed size represents an upper limit determined by physical forces, these results, in conjunction with those obtained using other techniques, lend credence to the existence of a nonrandom higher-order structure in mammalian chromosomal DNA.",Excluded,0.09312562
4356,"Crumbs homologue 1 is required for maintenance of photoreceptor cell polarization and adhesion during light exposure Loss of Crumbs homologue 1 (CRB1) function causes either the eye disease Leber congenital amaurosis or progressive retinitis pigmentosa, depending on the amount of residual CRB1 activity and the genetic background. Crb1 localizes specifically to the sub-apical region adjacent to the adherens junction complex at the outer limiting membrane in the retina. We show that it is associated here with multiple PDZ protein 1 (Mupp1), protein associated with Lin-7 (Pals1 or Mpp5) and Mpp4. We have produced Crb1(-/-) mice completely lacking any functional Crb1. Although the retinas are initially normal, by 3-9 months the Crb1(-/-) retinas develop localized lesions where the integrity of the outer limiting membrane is lost and giant half rosettes are formed. After delamination of the photoreceptor layer, neuronal cell death occurs in the inner and outer nuclear layers of the retina. On moderate exposure to light for 3 days at 3 months of age, the number of severe focal retinal lesions significantly increases in the Crb1(-/-) retina. Crb2, Crb3 and Crb1 interacting proteins remain localized to the sub-apical region and therefore are not sufficient to maintain cell adhesion during light exposure in Crb1(-/-) retinas. Thus we propose that during light exposure Crb1 is essential to maintain, but not assemble, adherens junctions between photoreceptors and Muller glia cells and prevents retinal disorganization and dystrophy. Hence, light may be an influential factor in the development of the corresponding human diseases.",Excluded,0.08588946

4359,"Radiation target delineation of micro brain arteriovenous malformations using highresolution flat-detector cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) Purpose Radiation therapy has shown to be an effective treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs).1 2 Target delineation is commonly performed on volumetric image data, such as MRI or CT data. However, the nidi of micro-AVMs may not be visualized adequately by these modalities due to their limited image resolution. In this report, we show a novel usage of high-resolution contrastenhanced cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging and multi-modal image registration<sup>3</sup> for radiation target delineation of a micro-AVM, a technique previously suggested for larger AVMs.4 Case A 42-year-old male presented with intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the mesencephalic tectum and left posterior thalamus. Conventional angiography revealed a left superior collicular AVM with a nidus of 3mm. The AVM was successfully embolized but follow-up angiography examinations at 36 months demonstrated a small re-growth of the AVM (Abstract P-017 figure 1A). The patient was thus referred to radiosurgery. Thin slice contrast and non-contrast MRI acquired for target delineation did not show the AVM nidus. Therefore, the patient was transferred to the angiography suite for high resolution contrast-enhanced CBCT. Data was acquired using the angiography c-arm system with a reduced detector size of 22 cm. Contrast was injected with 2 ml/s for a total of 64 ml and a 2 sec delay) using a coupled power injector into the left vertebral artery with a 5Fr catheter. Volumetric CBCT data (FOV: 70<sup>3</sup>mm<sup>3</sup>, matrix: 0.14<sup>3</sup>mm<sup>3</sup>) was generated using a nonbinned reconstruction algorithm. Lesion and nidus were visualized with CBCT. MRI, CT-simulator and CBCT data was then transferred to the radiation planning software and mutually co-registered. The nidus was delineated on CBCT data by an experienced neurointerventional radiologist for radiation therapy and dose/ treatment plan was completed. Due to image registration, the target area could be directly transferred to MRI and CT data (Abstract P-0017 figure 1B). The patient received a total of 4 radiation sessions. Discussion and Conclusion Radiation target delineation of micro AVMs can be challenging with conventional 3D imaging techniques as their spatial resolution is relatively low for the application of visualization of the nidus. We were able to demonstrate the complementary value of high resolution contrast enhanced CBCT in radiation target delineation of a micro brain AVM. Multi-modal image registration of CBCTwith MRI and CT-simulator has shown to be an effective method for radiation target delineation. (Figure presented).",Excluded,0.08622539
4360,"Attenuated pulse size, disorderly growth hormone and prolactin secretion with preserved nyctohemeral rhythm distinguish irradiated from surgically treated acromegaly patients BACKGROUND: Radiation induces time-dependent loss of anterior pituitary function, attributed to damage of the pituitary gland and hypothalamic centres. The development of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in irradiated acromegaly patients is not well defined.OBJECTIVE: Detailed analysis of spontaneous 24-h GH and prolactin (PRL) secretion in relation to other pituitary functions and serum IGF-I concentrations in an attempt to find criteria for GHD in acromegalic patients with a GH response < 3 microg/l during the insulin tolerance test (ITT).DESIGN: Plasma hormone profiles obtained by 10 min sampling for 24 h in postoperatively irradiated acromegalic patients, compared with patients cured by surgery only and matched healthy controls.SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: University setting. Fifteen subjects in each group.OUTCOME MEASURES: GH and PRL secretory parameters quantified by deconvolution, cluster, cosinor and approximate entropy (ApEn) analyses, IGF-I concentrations.RESULTS: Irradiation attenuated pulsatile secretion of GH and PRL, but total PRL secretion was unchanged. GH and PRL secretory regularity were diminished. Circadian timing remained intact. Pulsatile GH secretion and IGF-I were correlated (R = 0.30, P = 0.04). Criteria of pulsatile GH secretion = 12 microg/l/24 h and ApEn = 0.800 separated 12 of 15 irradiated patients from all others.CONCLUSION: Irradiated acromegaly patients with a subnormal GH response to ITT have very limited spontaneous GH secretion, with specific attenuation of the size of GH bursts and a highly irregular pattern, but with retained diurnal properties. These patients are thus likely GH-deficient and might benefit from GH replacement.",Included,0.981547

Hypoxia has been demonstrated in primary brain tumors and may be one of the reasons for their radioresistance. In experimental models carbogen breathing and nicotinamide have been shown to act against hypoxia by different mechanisms and both modalities were tested in 16 patients with supratentorial malignant gliomas in combination with a conventional radiotherapy scheme (50 Gy in 25 daily fractions). The present study was performed to determine the feasibility and toxicity of conventional radiotherapy combined with carbogen breathing and nicotinamide.

Expert listeners rated voice and speech quality (based on Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain), articulation (overall, [p], [t], [k]), and comparative mean opinion scores of voice and speech at three assessment points calculated. A structured study-specific questionnaire evaluated patients' perception pretreatment (N=55), at 10-week (N=49) and 1-year posttreatment (N=37).RESULTS: At 10 weeks, perceptual voice quality is significantly affected. The parameters overall voice quality (mean, -0.24; P=0.008), strain (mean, -0.12; P=0.012), nasality (mean, -0.08; P=0.009), roughness (mean, -0.22; P=0.001), and pitch (mean, -0.03; P=0.041) improved over time but not beyond baseline levels, except for asthenia at 1-year posttreatment (voice is less asthenic than at baseline; mean, +0.20; P=0.03). Perceptual analyses of articulation showed no significant differences. Patients judge their voice quality as good (score, 18/20) at all assessment points, but at 1-year posttreatment, most of them (70%) judge their ""voice not as it used to be."" In the 1-year versus 10-week posttreatment comparison, the larynx-hypopharynx tumor group was more strained, whereas nonlarynx tumor voices were judged less strained (mean, -0.33 and +0.07, respectively; P=0.031). Patients' perceived changes in voice and speech quality at 10-week post- versus pretreatment correlate weakly with expert judgments.CONCLUSION: Overall, perceptual CCRT effects on voice and speech seem to peak at 10-week posttreatment but level off at 1-year posttreatment.

4363,"A colourful clock Circadian rhythms are an essential property of life on Earth. In mammals, these rhythms are coordinated by a small set of neurons, located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). The environmental light/dark cycle synchronizes (entrains) the SCN via a distinct pathway, originating in a subset of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) that utilize the photopigment melanopsin (OPN4). The pRGCs are also innervated by rods and cones and, so, are both endogenously and exogenously light sensitive. Accumulating evidence has shown that the circadian system is sensitive to ultraviolet (UV), blue, and green wavelengths of light. However, it was unclear whether colour perception itself can help entrain the SCN. By utilizing both behavioural and electrophysiological recording techniques, Walmsley and colleagues show that multiple photic channels interact and enhance the capacity of the SCN to synchronize to the environmental cycle. Thus, entrainment of the circadian system combines both environmental irradiance and colour information to ensure that internal and external time are appropriately aligned.",Excluded,0.08627035
4364,"Recommendations for measuring non-image-forming effects of light: A practical method to apply on cognitive impaired and unaffected participants Background: The non-image-forming effects of luminous radiation on people with intellectual disabilities or dementia received attention from researchers. Such studies, however, have generally been conducted using disparate methodologies which precludes generalization and reproducibility. OBJECTIVE(S): The aim of this study was to determine the practical applicability of measurement devices for studies investigating non-image-forming effects of luminous radiation, specifically for people with intellectual disabilities or dementia. METHOD(S): In three experiments, ten cognitive impaired people and thirty-nine unaffected subjects participated by wearing one or more portable devices. Six devices were assessed in total. Measurement data was accompanied with user experiences obtained from questionnaires, interviews and observations in order to assess the devices on practical and comfort issues. RESULT(S): On average, the devices worn by the cognitive impaired subjects were not experienced as annoying or irritating. No significant differences are found between genders and for one of the portable devices significantly less annoyance was reported by the cognitive impaired participants compared to the unaffected group of participants. INNOVATIVE SOLUTION: The three phases of the research process in towards measuring personal luminous exposures are: selection of the most suitable portable device, application of the assessment method, and the application of the device in the (pilot) study. CONCLUSION(S): However, the findings of this study suggest that inaccuracies potentially caused by practical and comfort issues associated with the portable devices need to be considered.

The effects on tumour growth, the efficiency of i.a. infusion, the efficacy of retention of microspheres in the primary tumour and the excretion of free holmium-166 were analyzed. Complete tumour remissions were obtained in 79% and 86% following embolization with radioactive and inactive microspheres, respectively. Over 95% of the microspheres were retained in the tumour and the leaching of holmium-166 in urine and faeces was less than 0.1% in 2 days. The injection efficiency was not optimal, as 40% of the microspheres were retained in the cannulation system. Arterio-arteriolar connections should be detected and closed prior to embolization to prevent stray emboli from entering the brain.

4366,"Cryptochromes and inner retinal non-visual irradiance detection Nearly all circadian clocks have free-running periods that differ significantly from 24 hours. To maintain synchrony with the 24 h day, the mammalian circadian clock is reset by light. Unlike other animals, mammalian circadian entrainment occurs exclusively via the eyes and optic nerves. Remarkably, the classical photoreceptors--the rods and cones--are not necessary for photic entrainment. Instead, a subset of inner retinal ganglion cells are directly photoresponsive and transmit photic information specifically to brain centres involved in irradiance detection, including the master circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. The photopigment(s) responsible for inner retinal phototransduction are unknown. Several lines of evidence constrain candidate photopigments. First, near-total vitamin A depletion does not diminish retinohypothalamic signalling. Second, loss of cryptochrome function in retinal-degenerate mice substantially decreases photic signalling to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and markedly decreases pupillary light responses. Third, vitamin A depletion of cryptochrome mutant mice leads to loss of photic signalling to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These findings suggest a model where either classical photopigments or inner retinal photopigments are sufficient for non-visual irradiance detection.",Excluded,0.086147934

The objective of this randomized and controlled study was to assess the efficacy of voice therapy in these patients.METHODS: Of 177 patients, 6-120 months after treatment for early glottic carcinoma, 70 patients (40%) suffered from voice impairment based on a 5-item screening questionnaire. Approximately 60% of those 70 patients were not interested in participating in the current study. Twenty-three patients who were willing to participate were assigned randomly either to a voice therapy group (n = 12 patients) or to a control group (n = 11 patients). Multidimensional voice analyses (the self-reported Voice Handicap Index [VHI], acoustic and perceptual voice quality analysis, videolaryngostroboscopy, and the Voice Range Profile) were conducted twice: before and after voice therapy or with 3 months in between for the control group.RESULTS: Statistical analyses of the difference in scores (postmeasurement minus premeasurement) showed significant voice improvement after voice therapy on the total VHI score, percent jitter, and noise-to-harmonics ratio in the voice signal and on the perceptual rating of vocal fry.CONCLUSIONS: Voice therapy proved to be effective in patients who had voice problems after treatment for early glottic carcinoma.

4368,"Hippocampal Avoidance Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation-a novel coplanar linac-based technique Purpose/Objective: To develop a new treatment technique for prophylactic radiotherapy of the whole brain with avoidance of the hippocampi. This technique was implemented in our institute within the context of our participation in the 'Hippocampal Avoidance Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation' clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01780675). In this phase III multicentre trial patients with small cell lung cancer are randomised to receive Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (PCI) with or without Hippocampal Avoidance (HA). Material(s) and Method(s): The Hippocampal Avoidance Zone is defined as both hippocampi (left and right) extended with a margin of 5 mm. The Planning Target Volume (PTV) is defined as the brain extended with a margin of 4 mm minus the Hippocampal Avoidance Zone. The goal was to deliver 25 Gy to at least 95% of the PTV in 10 fractions, while sparing the hippocampi (mean dose < 8.5 Gy; max dose < 10 Gy) and eye lenses (max dose < 10 Gy). A coplanar VMAT technique with two dual arcs was planned using Pinnacle3 v9.8 (Philips). Overnight optimization was performed using a homemade script to repeat SmartArc optimizations at a 3mm dose grid until no further decrease in cost function was obtained. For this study, HA-PCI treatment plans with a controlpoint-spacing (CPS) of 4degree as well as 2degree were created for 7 patients. Subsequently, the plans were delivered on an Elekta linac with an Agility MLC (5mm leaves). Pre-treatment delivery-QA was performed by measuring the dose distribution using a cylindrical diodearray phantom (Delta4, ScandiDos). The measured dose distributions were compared to the TPS calculations using a 4%/2mm gamma criterion, aiming for a pass rate >95%. Planning parameters as well as QA measurement results were compared for the 4degree and 2degree plans. Result(s): The dose distribution of a typical HA-PCI treatment plan is shown in Figure 1. Planning parameters and QA measurement results of the 4o and 2o CPS plans for 7 patients are shown in Table 1. All plans achieved a homogeneous coverage of the PTV, while the objectives and constraints as defined in the study protocol were accomplished. QA measurements for the treatment plans with a CPS of 4degree showed better agreement with the TPS calculations than the 2degree CPS plans, with an average pass rate of 95.4% at a 4%/2mm gamma criterion (range 91.5 - 99.1%).

The exact significance and pathogenesis of the neurotoxicity is still unknown, as studies on this subject lack sufficient patient numbers and are performed in an extremely varied manner.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-nine survivors (> 2 years from diagnosis) were examined neurologically and neuropsychologically, and underwent a cranial computer tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance (MR). Eight patients were excluded from further analysis for various reasons (not SCLC-related CNS disease, n = 6; no chemotherapy nor PCI treatment, n = 2). The remaining 51 patients were divided into three groups; group 1 = chemotherapy alone (n = 21), group 2 = sequential PCI (n = 19), and group 3 = concurrent or sandwiched PCI (n = 11). Groups were neuropsychologically compared in matched controls.RESULTS: Performance status did not differ significantly between various treatment groups; all patients remained ambulatory and capable of self-care. Mental impairment (n = 20), motor abnormalities (n = 9), and visual complaints (n = 1), were found in five patients in group 1 (24%), eight patients in group 2 (42%), and eight patients in group 3 (73%). Analysis of brain atrophy revealed no significant results; however, white matter abnormalities were found more frequently in group 3. Neuropsychologically no significant group differences existed, although interference sensitivity and difficulties with divided attention tended to occur more frequently in patients treated with PCI. Mean neuropsychometric results of treatment groups were significantly worse than those of matched controls.CONCLUSIONS: Although more intensively treated patients showed more neurologic impairment and patients in group 3 had more white matter abnormalities, there was no statistic evidence for additional neurotoxicity of PCI. Marked neuropsychometric differences between patients and matched controls may indicate that cognitive impairment is partly disease related, probably due to emotional distress and deteriorated physical condition.",Excluded,0.98314214

However, concerns have been raised about potential long-term side effects, including cerebrovascular events (CVEs) and secondary intracranial tumors.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the risk of CVEs, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality in irradiated (IRR) NFPA patients, compared with NFPA patients who were not irradiated (non-IRR).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The study cohort included 806 patients with a NFPA from the Dutch National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults, a nationwide long-term surveillance study in severe GH-deficient adult patients. IRR patients (n = 456) were compared with non-IRR patients (n = 350).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CVEs, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality were measured.RESULTS: Sixty-nine subjects developed a CVE. In men, but not in women, the incidence of a CVE was significantly higher in IRR patients than in non-IRR patients (hazard ratio 2.99, 95% confidence interval 1.31-6.79). A secondary intracranial tumor developed in five IRR patients and two non-IRR patients. After adjustment for age, radiotherapy was not associated with mortality.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of secondary intracranial tumors and mortality did not differ between IRR and non-IRR patients.

4374,"Mechanism of magnetization transfer during on-resonance water saturation. A new approach to detect mobile proteins, peptides, and lipids The mechanism of magnetization transfer (MT) between water and components of the proton spectrum was studied ex vivo in a perfused cell system and in vivo in the rat brain (n = 5). Water was selectively labeled and spectral buildup consequential to transfer of longitudinal magnetization was followed as a function of time. At short mixing time (T(m)), nitrogen-bound solvent-exchangeable protons were observed, predominantly assigned to amide groups of proteins and peptides. At longer T(m), intramolecular nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) was observed in the aliphatic proton region, leading to a mobile-macromolecule-weighted spectrum that resembles typical protein spectra described in the literature. This effect on the proton spectrum is distinct from that of classical off-resonance MT, which has been shown to be due to the immobile solid-like proton pool. When studying a solution of major brain metabolites under physiological concentrations and conditions (pH), no transfer effects were observed, in line with expectations based on reduced NOE effects in rapidly tumbling molecules and the fast proton exchange rates of amino, amine, SH, and OH groups. The spectral intensities of the amide protons may serve as indicators for pH and cellular levels of mobile proteins and peptides, while the aliphatic components are representative of several types of mobile macromolecules, including proteins, peptides, and lipids.",Excluded,0.08576764

To benchmark both gel dosimeters, they were exposed to a 6 MV photon beam and the depth dose was compared against a diamond detector measurement that served as golden standard. Both gel dosimeters were found accurate within 4% accuracy. In the 3D dose matrix of the radiochromic gel, hotspot dose deviations up to 8% were observed which are attributed to the fabrication procedure. The polymer gel readout was shown to be sensitive to B0 field and B1 field non-uniformities as well as temperature variations during scanning. The performance of the two gel dosimeters was also evaluated for a brain tumour IMRT treatment. Both gel measured dose distributions were compared against treatment planning system predicted dose maps which were validated independently with ion chamber measurements and portal dosimetry. In the radiochromic gel measurement, two sources of deviations could be identified. Firstly, the dose in a cluster of voxels near the edge of the phantom deviated from the planned dose. Secondly, the presence of dose hotspots in the order of 10% related to inhomogeneities in the gel limit the clinical acceptance of this dosimetry technique. Based on the results of the micelle gel dosimeter prototype presented here, chemical optimization will be subject of future work. Polymer gel dosimetry is capable of measuring the absolute dose in the whole 3D volume within 5% accuracy. A temperature stabilization technique is incorporated to increase the accuracy during short measurements, however keeping the temperature stable during long measurement times in both calibration phantoms and the volumetric phantom is more challenging.

4376,"Model for focal demyelination of the spinal dorsal columns of transgenic MBP-LacZ mice by phototargeted ablation of oligodendrocytes Focal demyelination models provide powerful tools to study demyelination and remyelination in the central nervous system. In this report, we present a novel technique, which selectively targets oligodendrocytes within the spinal cord of transgenic mice to produce focal demyelination. Transgenic mice expressing the E. coli LacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene from the myelin basic protein promotor allowed for oligodendrocyte-specific cleavage of topically applied fluorescein-di-beta-galactopyranoside liberating photoactivatable fluorescein. Subsequent fluorescence illumination generated oxygen radicals that oxidized a second exogenous substrate, 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole, to form a toxic precipitate within oligodendrocytes. Histochemical staining of the spinal cord dorsal columns 8 days following phototargeting revealed that the treated region no longer contained beta-galactosidase-positive cells. Focal demyelination of the dorsal columns was observed to a depth of 150 microm in transverse semithin plastic sections. Numerous bundles of naked axons interspersed with myelin, debris-laden macrophages, and reactive astrocytes were evident by electron microscopy. Remyelination of axons by both oligodendrocytes and invading Schwann cells was observed within the treated region 14 days after phototargeting. Newly generated oligodendrocytes were identified within the demyelinated region by their incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine. Thus, this novel focal demyelination protocol provides: (1) a method for selective targeted ablation of oligodendrocytes in vivo, (2) control over the extent of the demyelinated region, with (3) an environment that maintains its remyelination capacity. Phototargeted ablation of oligodendrocytes may therefore be a useful model for studying axon-glia interactions, axon regeneration within a demyelinated zone, and remyelination of axons.",Excluded,0.08602436
4377,"[The stimulating impact of light on brain cognition function] Light regulates multiple non-visual circadian, neuroendocrine, and neurobehavioral functions, and conveys a strong stimulating signal for alert-ness and cognition. This review summarizes a series of neuroimaging studies investigating the brain mechanisms underlying the latter stimulating impact of light. Results of these studies are compatible with a scenario where light would first hit subcortical areas involved in arousal regulation before affecting cortical areas involved in the ongoing non-visual cognitive process, and then cognitive performance. Recent data demonstrated that the non-visual impact of light is most likely triggered via outputs from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which are maximally sensitive to blue light. In addition, the stimulating impact of light is intimately related to wakefulness regulation as it changes with circadian phase and sleep pressure. Finally, markers of inter-individual difference have also been described: age, PERIOD3 genotype, and psychiatric status.

4378,"Magnetic resonance based small animal radiotherapy in neuro-oncology Compared to computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides vastly superior soft-tissue contrast. This makes it much easier to visualize lesion boundaries that will result in a much better delineation of the target volume, helping to better irradiate the lesion and avoid surrounding tissue.Therefore, combining MRI with CT data is increasingly used for radiotherapy planning in the clinic. This combined CT/MRI dataset contains both the information required for targeting and for dose calculations. During this presentation, three studies will be presented where MRI and small animal radiotherapy were combined in the field of neuro-oncology. In a first study, we used a combined CT/MRI dataset to guide the irradiation of brain tumours in a F98 glioblastoma rat model using a micro-irradiator. Contrast-enhanced MRI images were acquired to follow up tumour growth after orthotopic inoculation, to monitor treatment response, and to delineate the target volume during radiotherapy planning. Using multiple non-coplanar arcs the prescribed dose could be delivered to 90% of the target volume, while minimizing the dose to normal brain tissue. A challenging aspects of small animal CT imaging relates to the radiation dose received by the animals. This might become a very important issue when the therapeutic dose has to be delivered in multiple fractions spaced over time, where each individual irradiation requires a CT for accurate animal positioning. Therefore, in a second study we investigated the feasibility of a MRI-only based workflow for radiotherapy planning of the rat brain, that enables both accurate target delineation and accurate dose calculations using only MRI-based volumes. Multiple MRI sequences were used to generate synthetic CT images that could be used for dose calculations, because only one MRI volume was not sufficient to separate all major tissue types (air, soft tissue, bone) in the rat head. The synthetic CT images were sufficiently similar to the segmented CT images that are routinely used for radiotherapy planning on preclinical radiation research platforms. No significant differences were observed between CT and MRI based dose calculations when more complex beam configurations (multiple beams) were used in the dose plan. However, further research is required in the thoracic or abdominal region of small animals, where more tissue classes will be required to allow for accurate dose calculations compared to the rat head. Finally, discrimination between brain tumor recurrence (glioblastoma) and radiation necrosis (RN) remains a diagnostic challenge because both entities have similar imaging characteristics on conventional MRI. Functional imaging techniques, such as dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI or positron emission tomography (PET), could overcome this diagnostic dilemma. A third study will be presented to investigate the potential of DCE-MRI and PET in discriminating high-grade glioma from RN in rats. Induction of RN was achieved by irradiating the right frontal region with 60 Gy using multiple arcs. Results suggested that functional imaging can be used to discriminate glioblastoma (recurrence) from RN. Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded,0.08629022
4379,"Cognitive Changes Related to Cancer Therapy A growing population of cancer survivors is at risk for acute and long-term consequences resulting from cancer and its treatment. Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) typically manifests as modest deficits in attention, processing speed, executive functioning, and memory, which may persist for decades after treatment. Although some risk factors for CRCI are largely immutable (eg, genetics and demographic factors), there are many other contributors to CRCI that when appropriately addressed can result in improved cognitive functioning and quality of life. Neuropsychological assessment can help identify patient cognitive strengths and weaknesses, target psychological and behavioral contributors to CRCI, and guide treatment interventions.",Excluded,0.09540775
4380,"Experience on the use of SIR-CIRSE guidelines for patient radiation dose management in neuroradiology Purpose: To present the experience and results of the application of the SIR-CIRSE guidelines for patient radiation dose management inneuroradiology. Material(s) and Method(s): The Guidelines approved in 2009 by the SIR Safety and Health Committee and the CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee have been applied in a university hospital over the last two years to identify patients with potential skin injuries after procedures over thresholds requiring follow-up: peak skin dose >3 Gy, reference point air kerma >5 Gy, kerma area product >500 Gy.cm2 or fluoroscopy time >60 min. X-ray system (biplane with flat detectors) was under a quality assurance program and patient dose records were archived individually according to the national regulations. Result(s): A total of 325 procedures (43% therapeutic, mainly cerebral embolizations) were included in the database during 2009 and 383 (40% therapeutic) during 2010. Out of these samples, and after analysing each dose report individually, during 2009, 20 patients (6.2%) were included in a follow-up program for potential skin injuries, while in 2010, after introducing several optimization actions, only 6 patients (1.6%) required the follow-up. The maximum patient dose values measured in a single procedure were 1405 Gy.cm2 and 10.8 Gy (cumulative skin dose). 11 patients resulted with radiation injuries. Conclusion(s): The application of the SIR-CIRSE Guidelines allowed standardizing the selection criteria to include certain patients in a follow-up program.

To evaluate the size of the optic nerve and optic nerve sheath in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) patients with or without optic pathway glioma (OPG) with 3D-SPACE sequence in 3 tesla magnetic resonans imaging (MRI) unit. Material and methods. Sixteen NF-1 patients with OPG (group 1), and 17 NF-1 patients without OPG (group 2) were included in this prospective study. All patients received conventional contrast-material enhanced brain MRI, and 3D-SPACE sequence. The size of the optic nerve and optic nerve sheath was measured on routine fat-saturated T2 weighted STIR and 3D-SPACE images. Patients with optic nerve glioma were excluded from the optic nerve and optic nerve sheath analysis. Results. The average size of the optic nerve and optic nerve sheath measured with both MRI techniques did not show any significant difference between group 1 and group 2 (p> 0.05). The variables measured with either STIR or 3DSPACE imaging techniques were correlated with each other in both groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). Discussion and conclusions. Our study demonstrated that OPG presented in the optic pathways including optic chiasm, optic tractus, and optic radiations did not significantly effect the size of the optic nerve and optic nerve sheat. 3D-SPACE sequence is an efficient sequence for evaluation of NF-1 patients.",Excluded,0.42883414
4382,"Feasibility of dose escalation using intraoperative radiotherapy following resection of large brain metastases compared to post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Post-operative SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery) for large brain metastases is challenged by risks of radiation necrosis that limit SRS dose. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a potential alternative, however standard dose recommendations are lacking.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty consecutive brain metastases treated with post-operative SRS were retrospectively compared to IORT plans generated for 10-30 Gy in 1 fraction to 0-5 mm by estimating the applicator size and distance from critical organs using pre-operative and post-operative MRI. Additionally, 7 consecutive patients treated with IORT 30 Gy to surface were compared to retrospectively generated SRS plans using the post-operative MRI to 15-20 Gy and 30 Gy in 1 fraction marginal dose.RESULTS: For the 20 resection cavities treated with SRS and retrospectively compared to IORT, IORT from 10 to 30Gy resulted in lower or not significantly different doses to the optic apparatus and brainstem. Comparatively for the 7 patients treated with IORT 30 Gy to retrospective SRS plans to standard 15-20 Gy and 30 Gy marginal dose, IORT resulted in significantly lower doses to the optic apparatus and brainstem. At a median follow-up of 6.2 months, 86% of patients treated with surgery and IORT achieved local control and 0% developed radiographic or symptomatic radiation necrosis.CONCLUSIONS: Critical organ dosimetry for IORT remains generally lower than that achieved with single fraction SRS following resection of large brain metastases. We recommend 30 Gy to surface as the preferred prescription, consistent with the dose recommendation for IORT in glioblastoma used in the ongoing INTRAGO-II phase-III trial. Early clinical outcomes appear promising for surgery and IORT.",Excluded,0.086961985
4383,"A puzzling case of presumed severe post-radiation pelvic myositis Background: A fit and well 56 year old woman under the care of Rheumatology with quiescent systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a past medical history of anal SCC 8 years ago, treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She presented in April 2016 with sudden onset severe pelvic pain and stiffness, which within days rendered her immobile. The symptoms had been preceded by mild flu like illness. Clinically she had no systemic features but on examination demonstrated significant bilateral pelvic girdle weakness and pain. There was no distal neurological deficit and no clinical findings suggesting an SLE flare. Working diagnosis was of myositis, possibly secondary to SLE. Method(s): Serology showed an acute phase response (CRP 298), normal CK, complement levels, ANA and dsDNA. Renal function was normal and there was no evidence of lupus nephritis. Within a week of admission she underwent a pelvic MRI (with STIR), which showed florid inflammation within the muscles of her pelvis. When compared to the map of her radiotherapy treatment, the area almost exactly matched. This changed her working diagnosis to include delayed onset radiotherapy-induced myositis. Result(s): Her inflammatory markers remained markedly elevated (CRP >250). She was due to start high dose steroids for treatment of myositis to cover any potential inflammatory component, in the knowledge that evidence for steroid use and success in radiation induced myositis was sparse and had modest success at best. Incidentally she was found to have intermittent genito-urinary symptoms over the preceding 4-5 months, including dyspareunia and intermittent purulent discharge. She had no other signs to suggest sepsis and observations were all normal. A high vaginal swab grew Group G streptococcus, which, following extensive gynaecology review investigation was subsequently found to be due to a small abscess inside the vagina. It was not amenable to surgical drainage and was treated conservatively with antibiotics. Within 2 weeks of antibiotics therapy, analgesia and physiotherapy for her reduced mobility, her inflammatory markers improved and her pain started to improve. She underwent an open muscle biopsy under GA which was inconclusive. Antibiotics were continued and after 3 weeks of inpatient IV treatment her inflammatory markers showed a dramatic improvement. Her pain gradually improved along with it, as did her mobility. Conclusion(s): She was discharged from hospital with a prolonged course of antibiotics and continues to make great progress. Steroids treatment is still on hold until infection cleared and recovery of function established. It remains to be seen if indeed the area of inflammation actually represents anything other than infection induced myositis.",Excluded,0.086125836

Immediately after hyperalgesia tests, blood samples were collected to analyze creatine kinase (CK) activity and the soleus muscle was removed for histological and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha immunohistological analyses. In all LEDT groups, plasma CK activity was reduced to levels similar to those measured in the CON group.

Mean age of the persons was 41. Vegetative dystonia syndrome was diagnosticated in 50% of examined subjects. The increased perception and pain thresholds, as well as the thresholds' asymmetry were determined in 30% of patients. The conduction velocity of sensory and motor nerves, as well as the neuromuscular transmission were normal. No substantial changes in parameters of the soleus H- and M-responses were detected. A decreased amplitude and increased latency of the evoked skin sympathetic potential were found indicating a decreased tone of the adrenergic sympathetic vasoconstrictors and cholinergic sudomotor fibres, that may be one of the pathogenic mechanisms of the sensory, vegetotrophovascular disorders for these subjects. Decreased activity of the sympathetic autonomic system causes permanent course of the vegetative dystonia syndrome and more seldom the parasympathetic autonomic paroxysms. A decreased tone of the sympathetic autonomic system may be due to the monoaminergic neuromediation inhibition (decreased noradrenaline and dopamine excretion for the same subjects), that can induce psychoemotional disorders, depression and sleep-wakeness cycle disorders.",Included,0.98216486

These data together with episodical public reports on long-term surviving cancer patients who use methadone led to a hype of methadone as an anti-cancer drug in social and public media. However, clinical evidence for a tumoricidal effect of methadone is missing and prospective clinical trials, except in colorectal cancer, are not envisaged because of the limited preclinical data available. The present article reviews the pharmacokinetics, potential molecular targets, as well as the evidence for a tumoricidal effect of methadone in view of the therapeutically achievable doses in the brain.

The biological effectiveness of HZE particles has yet to be established, particularly with regard to nervous tissue. Using heavy ions accelerated at the AGS of Brookhaven National Laboratory, we study the neurotoxic effects of iron particles. We exposed retinal explants, taken from chick embryos, to determine the dose response relationships for neurite outgrowth. Morphometric techniques were used to evaluate the in vitro effects of 1 GeV/a iron particles (LET 148 keV/micrometer). Iron particles produced a dose-dependent reduction of neurite outgrowth with a maximal effect achieved with a dose of 100 cGy. Doses as low as 10-50 cGy were able to induce reductions of the neurite outgrowth as compared to the control group. Neurite generation is a more sensitive parameter than neurite elongation, suggesting different mechanism of radiation damage in our model. These results showed that low doses/fluences of iron particles could impair the retinal ganglion cells' capacity to generate neurites indicating the highly neurotoxic capability of this heavy charged particle.",Included,0.9521637

We found classical practice effects in the iTBS and the sham group: WM performance improved following stimulation as measured by the discriminability index. However, this effect could not be observed in the cTBS group. We did not find any hemisphere-dependent effects, suggesting that the practice effect is not lateralized, and TBS affects WM performance in a comparable manner if administered either over the left or the right hemisphere. We propose that our findings represent a useful addition to the literature of TBS-induced effects on WM.

(177)Lu-DOTATATE and (68)Ga-DOTATOC/(68)Ga-DOTATATE are used, respectively, for PRRT and PET examinations targeting somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) in patients affected by neuroendocrine tumors. The aim of the study was to quantitatively and qualitatively compare the performance of (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE in the context of subsequent PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE under standardized conditions in the same patient as well as to investigate the sufficiency of standardized uptake value (SUV) for estimation of SSTR expression.METHODS: Ten patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors underwent one 45-min dynamic and 3 whole-body PET/CT examinations at 1, 2, and 3 h after injection with both tracers. The number of detected lesions, SUVs in lesions and normal tissue, total functional tumor volume, and SSTR volume (functional tumor volume multiplied by mean SUV) were investigated for each time point. Net uptake rate (Ki) was calculated according to the Patlak method for 3 tumors per patient.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in lesion count, lesion SUV, Ki, functional tumor volume, or SSTR volume between (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE at any time point. The detection rate was similar, although with differences for single lesions in occasional patients. For healthy organs, marginally higher uptake of (68)Ga-DOTATATE was observed in kidneys, bone marrow, and liver at 1 h. (68)Ga-DOTATOC uptake was higher in mediastinal blood pool at the 1-h time point (P = 0.018). The tumor-to-liver ratio was marginally higher for (68)Ga-DOTATOC at the 3-h time point (P = 0.037). Blood clearance was fast and similar for both tracers. SUV did not correlate with Ki linearly and achieved saturation for a Ki of greater than 0.2 mL/cm(3)/min, corresponding to an SUV of more than 25.CONCLUSION: (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE are suited equally well for staging and patient selection for PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE. However, the slight difference in the healthy organ distribution and excretion may render (68)Ga-DOTATATE preferable.

On the basis of the writers' own results and data in the literature it is postulated that the mechanism of action of UV radiation on neocortical electrical activity is based on changes in permeability of neuronal membranes to Na and K ions and subsequent membrane depolarization, whereas the action of visible radiation leads to thermal injury to the neurons in the irradiated zone, inducing irreversible suppression of their activity and a decrease in amplitude of the EEG.",Excluded,0.08643612

We investigated whether interstitial pulmonary edema develops as a result of a headward fluid shift or whether pulmonary tissue fluid volume is reduced as a result of the overall loss of body fluid. We measured pulmonary tissue volume (Vti), capillary blood flow, and diffusing capacity in four subjects before, during, and after 10 days of exposure to microG during spaceflight. Measurements were made by rebreathing a gas mixture containing small amounts of acetylene, carbon monoxide, and argon. Measurements made early in flight in two subjects showed no change in Vti despite large increases in stroke volume (40%) and diffusing capacity (13%) consistent with increased pulmonary capillary blood volume. Late in-flight measurements in four subjects showed a 25% reduction in Vti compared with preflight controls (P < 0.001). There was a concomittant reduction in stroke volume, to the extent that it was no longer significantly different from preflight control. Diffusing capacity remained elevated (11%; P < 0.05) late in flight.

4402,"Feasibility of intracoronary beta-irradiation to reduce restenosis after balloon angioplasty. A clinical pilot study BACKGROUND: With the aim of decreasing the incidence of restenosis after coronary balloon angioplasty, we developed a technique of intracoronary beta-irradiation using an endoluminally centered pure metallic 90Y source. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical feasibility and safety profile of this approach with a dose of 18 Gy delivered to the inner arterial surface.METHODS AND RESULTS: Between June 21 and November 15, 1995, fifteen patients (6 women and 9 men; mean age, 71 +/- 5 years) underwent intracoronary beta-irradiation immediately after a conventional percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedure. The PTCA/irradiation procedure was technically feasible in all attempted cases, and the delivery of the 18 Gy dose was accomplished without complications. In 4 patients, the intervention was completed through intra-arterial stent implantation because of dissection induced by the initial PTCA. During the follow-up period of 178 +/- 17 days (range, 150 to 225 days), no complication occurred that could be attributed to radiation therapy. No aneurysm or angiographically detectable thrombus was observed in any of the irradiated arterial segments. The clinical event rate (4 of 15 patients underwent further target lesion revascularization) and the angiographic follow-up (6 of 15 patients had a > 50%-diameter stenosis at the previously treated site) did not suggest a marked impact on the expected restenosis rate.CONCLUSIONS: This early experience demonstrates that our approach is feasible, and no side effects attributable to radiation were noted during a 6-month period of follow-up. Whether higher doses of beta-irradiation will favorably affect post-PTCA restenosis in patients must await further evaluation.",Excluded,0.08742096
4403,"Oxidative damage and repair in the developing nervous system Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a recognized cause of cell injury. In contrast to such well recognized cell injury, oxidative stress plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation and tumor promotion. This review examines the role of oxidative stress in initiating and promoting the establishment of normal or abnormal neuronal patterns and subsequent neurogenesis within the central and peripheral nervous system. In particular, the role of apoptosis in both normal and abnormal neuronal development and maturation will be examined with especial reference to the induction of apoptotic cell death following abusive ligand- induced ion movements. The interaction of oxidant stress and immediate-early response gene activation is discussed with further reference to the induction of apoptosis. While glutamate receptor activation appears mandatory for coordinate maturation and neuritogenesis, such neuronal survival and differentiation is intimately dependent upon the intracellular glutathione redox potential, maintained by cystine uptake. Selected examples of reactive oxygen species induced injury pertaining to developmental neurotoxicology are presented and include starvation, irradiation injury and glutamate excitotoxicity.",Excluded,0.08598931

4405,"Role of nanomedicine in treatment of brain cancer Background: Drug delivery to cancerous brain is a challenging task as it is surrounded by an efficient protective barrier. The main hurdles for delivery of bioactive molecules to cancerous brain are blood brain barrier (BBB), the invasive nature of gliomas, drug resistance, and difficult brain interstitium transportation. Therefore, treatment of brain cancer with the available drug regimen is difficult and has shown little improvement in recent years. Method(s): We searched about recent advancements in the use of nanomedicine for effective treatment of the brain cancer. We focused on the use of liposomes, nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and dendrimers to improve brain cancer therapy. Result(s): Nanomedicines are well suited for the treatment of brain cancer owing to their highly acceptable biological, chemical, and physical properties. Smaller size of nanomedicines also enhances their anticancer potential and penetration into blood brain barrier (BBB). Conclusion(s): Recently, nanomedicine based approaches have been developed and investigated for effective treatment of brain cancer. Some of these have been translated into clinical practice, in order to attain therapeutic needs of gliomas. Future advancements in nanomedicines will likely produce significant changes in methods and practice of brain cancer therapy. Copyright Â© 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.",Excluded,0.0860537

4407,"Space, gravity and the physiology of aging: parallel or convergent disciplines? A mini-review The abnormal physiology that manifests itself in healthy humans during their adaptation to the microgravity of space has all the features of accelerated aging. The mechano-skeletal and vestibulo-neuromuscular stimuli which are below threshold in space, result in an overall greater than 10-fold more rapid onset and time course of muscle and bone atrophy in space and the development of balance and coordination problems on return to Earth than occur with aging. Similarly, the loss of functional capacity of the cardiovascular system that results in space and continuous bed rest is over 10 times faster than in the course of aging. Deconditioning in space from gravity deprivation has brought attention to the medical hazards of deconditioning on Earth from gravity withdrawal as in sedentary aging. Though seemingly reversible after periods of 6 months in space or its ground analog of bed rest, it remains to be seen whether that will be so after longer exposures. Both adaptation to space and aging do not merely parallel but converge as disorders of mechanotransduction. Like spaceflight, its analog bed rest telescopes the changes observed with aging and serves as a useful clinical model for the study of age-related deconditioning. The convergence of the disciplines of aging, along with gravitational and space physiology is advancing the understanding and prevention of modern lifestyle medical disorders.",Excluded,0.08663484
4408,"Stereotactic proton beam therapy of skull base meningiomas PURPOSE: To review outcomes for patients with skull base meningiomas treated using the stereotactic proton beam at the National Accelerator Center (NAC), Republic of South Africa.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1993, 27 patients with intracranial meningiomas have been treated stereotactically with protons at NAC. Of those, 23 were located on the skull base, were large or had complex shapes, and were treated with radical intent. Both stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT, 16 or more fractions) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT, 3 fractions) were used. Eighteen patients underwent proton HSRT, while 5 patients were treated with SRT. The mean target volume for the HSRT group was 15.6 cm(3) (range 2.6-63 cm(3)). The mean ICRU reference dose was 20.3 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGyE), and the mean minimum planning target dose was 16.3 CGyE. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up periods were 40 and 31 months respectively. The mean volume in the SRT group was 43.7 cm(3), with ICRU reference doses ranging from 54 CGyE in 27 fractions to 61.6 CGyE in 16 fractions.RESULTS: In the HSRT group, 16/18 (89%) of patients remained clinically stable or improved, while 2/18 (11%) deteriorated. Radiologic control was achieved in 88% of patients, while 2 patients had a marginal failure. Among the 5 SRT patients, 2 were clinically better, and 3 remained stable. All SRT patients achieved radiologic control. Three patients (13%), 2 of them in the HSRT group, suffered permanent neurologic deficits.

4412,"Biochemical and clinical aspects of methotrexate neurotoxicity Acute, subacute and chronic neurotoxicity have been observed after the administration of high-dose and/or intrathecal methotrexate (MTX). Acute toxicity is usually transient without permanent damage. Subacute and chronic toxicity are associated with changes in the brain and/or the spinal cord which may be progressive and even lead to coma and death in severe cases. It is believed that MTX can induce direct toxic effects to the CNS by damaging the neuronal tissue. Moreover, MTX interferes with the metabolic pathways of folates, excitatory amino acids, homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine, adenosine and biopterins, inducing biochemical alterations which have been associated with neurotoxic symptoms. It has been suggested that acute toxicity is partly mediated by adenosine, whereas homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine, excitatory amino acids and biopterins may play an important role in the development of subacute and chronic toxicity. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of MTX neurotoxicity would offer the possibility of developing new therapeutic strategies for its treatment or prevention. Copyright Â© 2003 S.

We previously demonstrated that the administration of IGF1 preserves or restores salivary gland function following radiation. Based on these findings, we propose to study the effect of IGF1 on human head and neck carcinoma cells. Head and neck tumor cells treated with radiation have significant reductions in tumor cell survival, as measured by MTT and crystal violet assays, regardless of IGF1 pre-treatment. Head and neck squamous carcinoma cell xenografts treated with concurrent radiation+IGF1 also exhibit significant tumor growth delay; however, growth rates are elevated compared with those in irradiated xenografts. In contrast, administration of IGF1 after radiation treatment has no effect on tumor xenograft growth rates. Analysis of these data suggests that localized delivery may be required for concurrent therapy to prevent secondary side-effects of radiotherapy, while post-therapy administration of IGF1 could be considered for the restoration of salivary function.",Excluded,0.09590679
4415,"Effect of in utero irradiation on the postnatal development, behavior, and brain structure of rats: Dose fractionation with a 6-h interval Based on previous studies showing that exposure of the rat fetus to ionizing radiation produces dose-dependent (0.25-1.25 Gy) changes in postnatal development of behavior and decreases in the thickness of the cerebral cortex, we examined the extent to which dose fractionation would reduce expression of damage. Pregnant rats were exposed to single doses of 0.5 or 1.0 Gy, or to two doses of 0.5 Gy 6 h apart on day 15 of gestation. Offspring were subjected to four behavioral tests on postnatal days 7-28; the rats were then sacrificed and their brains removed and processed for histology. For all end points, the fractionated dose produced an effect that was intermediate between that of the 0.5- and 1.0-Gy doses and which, by interpolation, could be expressed as equivalent to a single dose between 0.5 and 1.0 Gy. The equivalent single dose was not significantly different from the 1.0-Gy dose for negative geotaxis (0.54 Gy), reflex suspension (0.80 Gy), and continuous corridor (0.85 Gy). For sine of the angle of the advance of hind feet (0.58 Gy), width of stride (0.69 Gy), length of stride (0.75 Gy), body weight (0.73 Gy), and cerebral cortex thickness (0.69 Gy), the fractionated dose produced effects significantly different (P < 0.05) from the 1.0-Gy dose.

Materials/Methods: We queried our institutional IRB-approved SBRT registry for the period 2004-2014 for any early stage SCLC patients with a minimum of 6 months follow up. All patients had biopsy proven disease and were deemed medically inoperable after tumor board review. Routine staging consisted of PET/CT and MRI brain scans only. The treatment model consisted of SBRT to the primary followed by adjuvant platinum based chemotherapy (CHT) and then prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). SBRT was delivered employing a stereotactic-specific LINAC with vacuum-bag based immobilization, abdominal compression, and infrared based X-ray positioning system+/- CBCT for image-guidance. Result(s): Of 747 definitively treated cancers over 10 years, 16 (2%) were SCLCs meeting study criteria. Patient characteristics revealed: median KPS was 80 (range 50-90), median age was 69 years (range 45-87), 50% of patients were female, median BMI was 28.2 (range 17.4-41.2). Tumor characteristics revealed: median tumor size was 3.25cm (range1.4-7.2), 4 (25%) tumors were ""central"" (per RTOG 0813 criteria), median PET-SUV<inf>max</inf> was 10.3 (range 2.8-21.1).

4417,"Salvage Free Tissue Transfer for Clival Osteoradionecrosis After Repeat Proton Beam Therapy BACKGROUND: Craniocervical junction chordoma treated with surgery and Proton Beam Therapy evolved with Osteonecrosis and CSF leak. As the vascularization of the head was compromised, we harvested an Anterolateral thigh musculofascial flap to seal the leak.CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old man presented with a history of chronic headaches and dysarthria with tongue deviation to the right. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lesion at the craniocervical junction with imaging characteristics compatible with chordoma. Endoscopic endonasal resection was followed by proton beam therapy. Recurrence of the chordoma was subsequently resected via far lateral approach again followed by proton beam therapy accumulating a total dose of 75 Gy. Unfortunately, this led to osteoradionecrosis of the skull base resulting in a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak more than 1 year after treatment. After multiple failed attempts to seal the defect using local vascularized tissue and free fat grafts, the defect was reconstructed with a vastus lateralis free tissue transfer. Six weeks later, the flap had mucosalized, the patient was pain free, and there was no evidence of a CSF leak.CONCLUSIONS: In select cases, vascularized free flaps offer a superior reconstruction for osteoradionecrosis because radiotherapy often compromises the blood supply of local tissues.",Excluded,0.08671992

The radiotracer (99mTc-MIBI) was injected in a peripheral vein 5 hours before the operation. A tumor to-normal tissue count ratio equal to or greater than 2/1 was considered indicative of tumor. MIBI SPECT was performed in five normal individuals in a pilot study.RESULTS: The gamma probe greatly facilitated intraoperative tumor detection (tumor to-normal brain count ratio was 5/1) and indicated a small piece of residual tumor after what was thought to be a complete tumor removal, allowing its resection, which, otherwise, would have been left behind. Postoperative CT confirmed complete tumor resection. The MIBI SPECT in normal individuals showed an increased uptake by the hypophisis, choroid plexus, skull, scalp and salivary glands and absence of uptake by the normal brain tissue.

However, this has so far not been evaluated in such comparative manner.METHODS: Radiation exposure to the surgeon was measured by digital dosimeters placed at the level of the eye, chest, and dominant forearm. Radiation exposure was measured from the time of positioning of the patient to the end of the procedure both for navigated (intraoperative 3-dimensional [3D] fluoroscopy-based) and non-navigated (2-dimensional fluoroscopy-guided) freehand posterior lumbar spine instrumentations. A 3D fluoroscopic scan was routinely performed at the end of the procedure for all patients.RESULTS: Patients were distributed evenly in the 2 groups in terms of sex, age, body mass index, and the number of operated levels. The accumulated radiation dose for the surgeon was significantly higher in the non-navigated group; up to 9.96 times. The radiation dose for the patient was higher with the freehand technique, 1884.8 cGy.cm (non-navigated) versus 887 cGy.cm (navigated), without reaching a statistically significant level.CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure to the surgeon during pedicle screw placement with the freehand technique is up to 9.96 times greater than with the use of navigation. In the latter group, the only radiation exposure comes from the preoperative-level control and positioning of the 3D C-arm before 3D fluoroscopic acquisition.

Not all people exposed to cranial radiation develop cognitive injury, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. There may also be sex differences in susceptibility to develop radiation-induced cognitive injury. The three major human apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms are encoded by distinct alleles (epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4).

A secondary aim was to compare the correlation between symptom severity and CBF.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Differences in regional cerebral perfusion between patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and healthy controls were investigated with pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling perfusion MR imaging. Twenty-one consecutive patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and 21 age- and sex-matched randomly selected healthy controls from the population registry were prospectively included.

Bone cancer pain is mostly associated with an inflammatory response dominated by local activation of osteoclasts and by astrogliosis in the spinal cord. We determined the effects of a 6 Gy irradiation given focally on osteolytic sarcoma cells inoculated in humeri of mice. Pain behavior was assessed using the rota-rod and the grip force test. Seven days post-irradiation (day 17 post-tumor implantation) the performance of mice markedly improved on the rotarod (non-irradiated, 67+/-16s vs irradiated, 223 +/- 22 s; P = 0.0005), and the grip force test (non-irradiated, 34 +/- 4 g vs irradiated, 55 +/- 2 g; P = 0.001). This improvement was similar to the analgesia achieved with 30 mg/kg of the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ketorolac (Rota-rod, 67 +/- 16 s vs 178 +/- 35 s; P = 0.01: grip force test, 34 +/- 4 g, vs 60 +/- 5 g; P = 0.003). Following irradiation, the tumor mass and the number of osteoclasts did not decrease while the expression of two pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) increased. Tumor irradiation led to clear differences in the spinal cord. These include a decrease in glial activity (astrocytes and microglial cells) as well as pain mediators such as dynorphin, COX-2 and chemotactic cytokine receptor (CCR2). We conclude that the analgesic effect of low dose irradiation of bone cancer is associated with the alteration of nociceptive transmission in the central nervous system.",Excluded,0.98428506

No effect of irradiation on dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes was observed. Previously it was shown that, on exposure to gamma-rays, sphingomyelin and phosphatidylglycerol, as opposed to phosphatidylcholine, broke down into fragments of lower molecular weight.

4435,"Interstitial irradiation with stereotactically implanted I-125 seeds for the treatment of cerebral glioma Owing to its low rate of side effects and its high efficacy, interstitial irradiation with low-activity seeds should be the first therapeutic step in small (maximal diameter 40 mm), well-circumscribed, low-grade gliomas affecting the brain stem, other midline structures, or eloquent cerebral areas. In anaplastic gliomas, a therapeutic schedule using low-activity seeds and combining interstitial irradiation with radiotherapy (reduced boost dose of 15-30 Gy) seems to be more effective than interstitial irradiation alone. Compared with interstitial irradiation with high-activity seeds, this combined irradiation schedule caused no space-occupying radiation necrosis. Thus, it can be recommended as up-front treatment in patients with small (maximal diameter <40 mm) inoperable anaplastic gliomas. The use of high-activity I-125 seeds and interstitial irradiation at comparably high dose rates, integrating a small penumbra of normal brain tissue into the treatment volume, improved survival significantly in patients with primary highly malignant gliomas. In patients with recurrent tumors, the same treatment schedule did not substantially prolong survival compared with results obtained after resection plus radiotherapy. Owing to the high frequency of space-occupying radiation necrosis (40-60%), this schedule is only applicable in surgically accessible tumors. The application of low-activity I-125 seeds (in primary glioblastomas in combination with radiotherapy, in recurrent tumors without radiotherapy) yielded a median survival comparable with conventionally treated patients. There was no need for reoperation because of radiation necrosis. Thus, this treatment schedule is useful in both operable and surgically inaccessible glioblastomas.",Excluded,0.086249866

4440,"Increased expression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein in limbic brain regions after amygdala-kindled seizures in rats Increased expression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp; ABCB1) has previously been found in epileptogenic brain tissue from patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) as well as in the hippocampus and other limbic brain regions in the rat kainate model of TLE. Approaches to the quantification of Pgp expression have mainly been based on subjective visual estimation of the level of Pgp immunoreactivity in brain sections. In the present study, computer-assisted image analysis based on optical density (OD) measurements was used to examine immunohistochemical expression of Pgp in the kindling model of TLE. Sections from kainate-treated rats were used for comparison. Using diaminobenzidine as chromogen, Pgp was exclusively located in brain capillary endothelial cells, which was confirmed by double-labeling with an antibody against the endothelial glucose transporter (GLUT-1). After kainate-induced seizures, the intensity of endothelial Pgp staining significantly increased by 70-80% in the dentate gyrus. A significant, albeit less marked increase in Pgp expression in this area was also seen after amygdala-kindled seizures. Furthermore, Pgp was upregulated after kindling in the hilus of the dentate gyrus, the CA1 and CA3 sectors of the hippocampus, and the piriform and cerebral cortex. In kindled rats, most Pgp alterations occurred ipsilateral to the electrode in the basolateral amygdala. The data demonstrate that computer-assisted image analysis using OD is an accurate and rapid method to determine the relative amount of Pgp protein in brain sections and the effects of seizures on this multidrug transporter. The fact that Pgp overexpression in brain capillary endothelial cells occurs in two established models of difficult-to-treat TLE substantiates the notion that seizure-induced upregulation of Pgp contributes to multidrug resistance (MDR) in epilepsy.",Excluded,0.085876755

For this purpose a volume-of-interest (VOI) for each entity has to be defined in image data, acquired at days 1, 2 and 3 p.i. We have studied a method to automatically segment tumour and kidney VOIs in 4D SPECT data compared to manually defined VOIs. Material(s) and Method(s): Three patients (mean 70.7y) with neuroendocrine tumours who received 7.4GBq of Lu-177 DOTATATE were imaged with a Dual-head SPECT/CT (Siemens Symbia T2) with 20s/step in 64 steps/head. The CT image taken at day 1 was coregistered to each SPECT dataset and utilized for attenuation correction in penalized OSEM reconstruction employing compensation for distance dependent detector blur and photon scatter. The three SPECT volumes were synthesized to form a 4D SPECT study. A robust k-means cluster algorithm was used to automatically detect eight clusters in these dynamic image data, followed by a labeller to segment each individual connected VOI. For comparison, three to five tumours and two kidney VOIs were manually defined for each patient and an auto contour at the 40% of maximum value was applied. Based on the mean time-activity curves of each selected VOI a 3D dose map was calculated using S-value convolution kernels (Monte Carlo simulation in soft tissue). Result(s): The automatic segmentation successfully found 11 out of 12 tumour VOIs and three out of six kidney cortex VOIs. The missed entities can be addressed to overlapping with surrounding high-activity VOIs, mainly tumours and spleen. The mean dose values of the 11 tumours were 17.2+/-9.1Gy with the automatic and 16.5+/-9.1Gy with the manual method. The estimated dose to the cortex of the three successfully segmented kidneys was 9.7+/-1.7Gy with the automatic and 8.7+/-1.1Gy with the manual method. We found a strong correlation (rho=0.8) and no significant difference (paired t-test) between the dose estimates of both methods. Conclusion(s): The automatic segmentation is a promising approach to reduce the effort to generate dose estimates in PRRT. Nevertheless we observed that the position of kidneys can significantly change between measurement days, hindering an accurate coregistration on the voxel or organ boundary level. These misregistered boundaries can result in false segmentation and dosimetric results. Furthermore the inclusion of structural information such as the CT image into the automatic segmentation algorithm could be a promising improvement.",Excluded,0.085753046

The rats were repeatedly (3 days, 30 min day(-1)) exposed to low-intensity (approximately = 0.3 mW cm(-2)) microwaves (915 MHz, 20-ms pulse duration), amplitude modulated (square-wave) at extremely low frequency (4 Hz).RESULTS: The exposure to extremely low frequency microwaves alone significantly enhanced the fast electroencephalographic rhythms (18-30 Hz). This effect was observed neither in subsequent sham-exposure experiment nor in radiation-naive animals. In the microwave-exposed rats, scopolamine (0.1 mg kg(-1), subcutaneously) did not cause a slowing in the electroencephalogram that was shown in non-exposed rats. A similarity between the scopolamine-induced electroencephalogram effect in the microwave-exposed rats and that of physostigmine (enhancing the acetylcholine level in the brain) in radiation-naive animals was noted.

In the present case report the radiotherapy technique combining whole brain radiotherapy with hippocampal sparing (hippocampal avoidance whole brain radiotherapy HA-WBRT) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) of the brain metastases is performed in a patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. HA-WBRT was administered to 30 Gy in 10 fractions with sparing of the hippocampal structures and SRT of 21 Gy in 3 fractions to brain metastases which has preceded the HA-WBRT. Two single arc volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) plans were prepared using Monaco planning software. The HA-WBRT treatment plan achieved the following results: D2=33.91 Gy, D98=25.20 Gy, D100=14.18 Gy, D50=31.26 Gy. The homogeneity index was calculated as a deduction of the minimum dose in 2% and 98% of the planning target volume (PTV), divided by the minimum dose in 50% of the PTV.

The search for reliable markers of the disease that could be used for non invasive diagnostics is constantly needed. One of the hypotheses for gait impairment in NPH is the affection of periventricular white matter. METHODS In this study 15 patients were investigated for possible NPH. All patients underwent diagnostic testing (lumbar infusion test and 5 days of external lumbar drainage for diagnosis of NPH). Only the patients with positive diagnostic response were included in the study (n=10), all patients with postive response were finally treated by venriculoperitoneal shunt. All patients underwent MRI examination including T2W, T1W and DTI sequence of the whole brain in axial sections (EPI, TR/TE=12,000/ 89.4 ms, 40 slices with thickness of 2,4 mm, no gap, 128x 128 matrix, FOV 24x24 cm2; along 30 noncollinear gradient directions with b value of 1000 s/mm2, with additional five b=0 images). Anatomical 3D T1W sequence was also acquired. Twenty age matched subjects with Alzheimer disease resulting in marked atrophia and venricular dilatation, without clinical signs of NPH were examined with the same technique. Following parameters were then manually measured: fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in fornix, splenium of corpus callosum, genu of the internal capsule, and optic radiation. The ROIs were placed two slices above the slice where anterior comissure could be detected. A Mann Whitney U test was used for the analysis of the results.

4451,"Defining the mechanisms that underlie cortical hyperexcitability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS] is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder of motor neurons, heralded by the development of cortical hyperexcitability. Reduction of short interval intracortical inhibition [SICI] in ALS, a feature linked to the development of cortical hyperexcitability, may be mediated by degeneration of inhibitory circuits or alternatively activation of high threshold excitatory circuits. As such, determining the mechanisms of SICI reduction in ALS has clear diagnostic and therapeutic significance. Consequently, the present study utilized a novel threshold tracking paired-pulse paradigm to determine whether SICI reduction in ALS represented reduced inhibition or excessive excitation. Using a 90 mm circular coil, SICI was assessed at three different conditioning stimulus intensities: 40%, 70% and 90% of resting motor threshold [RMT]. Motor evoked potential responses were recorded over the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. Short interval intracortical inhibition was uniformly reduced across all three levels of conditioning intensities in ALS [40% RMT, ALS -0.6+/-0.7%, controls 2.0+/-0.6%, P<0.01; 70% RMT, ALS 0.6+/-2.7%, controls 12.8+/-2%, P<0.001; 90% RMT, ALS -15.9+/-1.3%, controls 2.2+/-4.1%, P<0.01]. In addition, the resting motor threshold was reduced, while the motor evoked potential amplitude was increased in ALS patients, in keeping with cortical hyperexcitability. These findings establish that SICI reduction in ALS represents degeneration of inhibitory cortical circuits, combined with excessive excitation of high threshold excitatory pathways. Neuroprotective strategies aimed at preserving the integrity of intracortical inhibitory circuits, in addition to antagonizing excitatory cortical circuits, may provide novel therapeutic targets in ALS.",Excluded,0.0862005

4455,"Evidence that tRNA synthetase-directed proton transfer stops mistranslation To prevent mistranslation, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) discriminate against noncognate amino acids and cellular metabolites. Defects in specificity produce statistical proteins which, in mammalian cells, lead to activation of the unfolded protein response and cell death. Because of inherent limitations in amino acid discrimination by a single active site, AARSs evolved a separate domain to clear mischarged amino acids. Although the structure of a widely distributed editing domain for ThrRS and AlaRS is known, the mechanism of amino acid clearance remains elusive. This domain has two motifs that together have four conserved residues in the pocket used to clear serine from mischarged tRNAs. Here, using ThrRS as an example, rapid single-turnover kinetics, mutagenesis, and solvent isotope analysis show that a strictly conserved histidine (between ThrRS and AlaRS) extracts a proton in the chemical step of the editing reaction. Three other conserved residues, and two additional residues in the editing pocket, are not directly implicated in the chemical step. These results are relevant to the previously reported mutagenesis of the homologous editing pocket of alanyl-tRNA synthetase, where even a mild defect in editing causes neurodegeneration in the mouse.

It has not been shown, however, which of the two is the more decisive factor. We tested this issue at the calyx of Held synapse by combining Ca2+ uncaging and electrophysiological measurements of postsynaptic responses. After depletion of the synaptic vesicles that are responsible for synchronous release during action potentials, uniform elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by Ca2+ uncaging could still elicit rapid release. The Ca2+ sensitivity of remaining vesicles was reduced no more than 2-fold, which is insufficient to explain the slow-down of the kinetics of release (10-fold) observed during a depolarizing pulse.

In the pharmacokinetic analysis, target enzyme density was quantified as total distribution volume (V ) using the two-tissue compartment model and serial concentrations of parent radioligand in arterial plasma. In one male rhesus monkey, four PET whole body scans were performed on different days. The first scan was acquired under baseline conditions, and rolipram (1.0 mg/kg), a PDE4 inhibitor, was administered IV in the second scan. The same baseline and blocked paradigms were repeated with PF- 06445974 (0.1 mg/kg) as the blocking drug. Finally, brain PET scans were conducted in four rats. Concentration of radioactivity as standardized uptake value (SUV) was compared across conditions and species. Result(s): [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 readily entered human brain and showed widespread distribution, with lower binding in cerebellum. V was well identified in all examined brain regions, and V calculated from the first 90 min of scan data fell within 10%. V was highest in thalamus and striatum, broadly matching human brain RNA expression. Wholebody imaging in the two humans and one monkey was notable for early distribution in the blood pool, accumulation in target organs (i.e., brain, lung), and excretion via urinary tract. Doses in the two humans were 19.6 and 19.3 muSV/MBq, respectively, similar to the value extrapolated from monkey (16.5 muSv/MBq). In monkey blocking scans, both drugs substantially blocked brain uptake; at 60 min, rolipram blocked 78% of uptake and PF-06445974 blocked 92%. However, for the rolipram-blocked scan, radioactivity in brain increased after 20 min and returned to baseline by the end of the scan. Rats showed a similar pattern to monkey. To assess whether this was due to radiometabolite in brain or rapid rolipram clearance, a second rolipram dose was injected as a displacing agent at 120 min in a rat that had undergone pre-injection of 1 mg/kg iv. This repeat rolipram dose replenished rolipram concentrations in brain and restored its ability to block radioligand binding, proving that no radiometabolite entered rat or monkey brain. Conclusion(s): [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 successfully imaged and quantified PDE4B in human brain. No radiometabolite contamination occurred, reflecting parent radioligand binding to PDE4 in brain. In nonhuman primates,, rolipram washed out more quickly than PF-06445974. Fig.1 In human brain, [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 had widespread distribution, with high uptake in striatum and thalamus.

4464,"Repeat intracoronary radiation for recurrent in-stent restenosis in patients who failed intracoronary radiation BACKGROUND: Intracoronary radiation therapy (IRT) is the only proven treatment for in-stent restenosis (ISR). It is, however, associated with a significant failure rate. The present study evaluated the outcomes of patients who underwent repeat intracoronary radiation for recurrent ISR.METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-one consecutive patients who failed a previous radiation treatment, presented with angina and angiographic evidence of ISR, and were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and repeat radiation to the same segment were studied. Twenty-five patients were treated with gamma radiation in a dose of 15 Gy, and 26 were treated with beta radiation doses of 18.3 to 23 Gy. The mean cumulative dose for this cohort was 39.5+/-11.9 Gy (range, 29 to 75.6 Gy). The outcomes of those patients were compared with outcomes of 299 patients who also failed initial radiation but were treated with repeat conventional PCI to a previously irradiated segment without repeat radiation. At 9 months after treatment, the repeat-IRT group had lower rates of target lesion revascularization (23.5% versus 54.6%; P<0.001) and major adverse cardiac events, including target vessel revascularization (29.4% versus 61.3%; P<0.001). At 9 months, patients with repeat IRT were free of angiographic and clinical events related to the radiation therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Repeat gamma or beta radiation to treat failed IRT for ISR after conventional PCI is safe and effective at 9 months and should be considered as a therapeutic option for this difficult patient subset.",Excluded,0.9498597
4465,"Role of short TE 1H-MR spectroscopy in monitoring of post-operation irradiated patients Post-surgical radiation therapy is a routine procedure in the treatment of primary malignant brain tumors. Along with modest therapeutic effects conventional fractionated radiotherapy, in spite of any modifications, produces damage to non-malignant brain tissues lying within the treatment volume, the extent of which depends on radiation dose. Serial 1H-MRS allows non-invasive investigation of tissue metabolic profiles. In the present study the ratios of resonance signals assigned to the major 1H-MRS-visible metabolites (N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine, inositol, lactate and lipid methylene group) were evaluated before, during and after post-surgical fractionated radiotherapy in brain regions close to and more distant from the tumor bed, receiving different radiation exposures (60 and < 40 Gy, respectively). The study group consisted of ten patients (aged 28-51). A MRI/MRS system (Elscint 2T Prestige) operating at the field strength of 2 T and the proton resonance frequency of 81.3 MHz has been used and the 1H-MR spectra were acquired using single voxel double-spin-echo PRESS sequence with a short TE. The spectra were post-processed with automatic fitting in the frequency domain. It was found that although the metabolite profiles depend on the dose obtained, but other stress factors (like surgery) seem to contribute to the overall picture of the metabolic status of the brain as well. In studies of early irradiation injuries, an increase of choline related ratios may serve rather as cell proliferation indictors than as cell injury ones, whereas the mI/Cr ratio appears as one of the first indicators of local irradiation injury. In order to establish the prognostic marker for early radiation damage, however, it seems necessary to analyze all visible metabolites as well. None of the metabolites separately may serve as such an indicator due to the complexity of tissue metabolism. Interestingly, MRI reveals no changes during the therapy process, whereas the metabolite ratios are being affected in the course of time, thus supporting the presumption that the 1H-MRS is a valuable method of radiation therapy monitoring.",Excluded,0.929516
4466,"Hyperthermia promotes c-myc turnover and reduces ODC expression in colorectal cancer cells Hyperthermia therapy is an FDA-approved procedure that is used to improve the clinical response to radiation and chemotherapy in a variety of solid malignancies. This method involves raising the temperature of tumor-bearing tissues to 41-43degreeC, which is commonly achieved by using microwave or radiofrequency (RF)-emitting devices. Despite a multitude of treatment centers that are now providing this type of therapy, the cellular and molecular processes are not fully understood. Here, we report that that the oncogenic transcription factor, c-myc has a potentially important role in the anti-cancer mechanism of hyperthermia. By treating colorectal cancer cells (RKO cell line) with heat (incubation at 42degreeC), we observe a rapid decrease in c-myc levels that is not seen with other transcription factors. We have also observed a similar effect in other cell types, including lung (A549) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y). It is already known that the turnover of c-myc protein is enhanced by phosphorylation at Thr58. Our Western blot data reveal that hyperthermia causes a significant increase in Thr58 phosphorylation, which is accompanied by a reduction in total c-myc levels. c-Myc is frequently deregulated in human cancers, where it promotes the expression of genes that drive tumor cell proliferation. To assess the role of c-myc target genes in the response to hyperthermia, we looked at one such target gene, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis. We see that the hyperthermia-induced degradation of c-myc is accompanied by a drastic reduction in ODC mRNA and protein levels. Using actinomycin D, we observe that heat has no effect on ODC mRNA stability, suggesting that the decrease in ODC is due to a reduction in gene transcription. In support of this, we find that silencing c-myc expression with siRNA inhibits ODC mRNA and protein levels by a similar amount as hyperthermia. We propose that the down-regulation of ODC caused by c-myc degradation may be an important part of the clinical response to hyperthermia, and future work will evaluate the effect of heat on cellular polyamine levels.",Excluded,0.08589661
4467,"Inhibition of nerve conduction by electromagnetic induction of the frog sciatic nerve-gastrocnemius muscle preparation The effect of electromagnetic induction (EMI) on impulse conduction and muscle contraction was studied in isolated sciatic nerve-gastrocnemius muscle preparation of the frog. Electrical stimulation (ES) of the sciatic nerve, at 0.5 Hz with 0.6 V (supramaximal) and 1-ms pulse duration, produced twitch contractions (3.5 +/- 0.4 g tension, mean +/- S.E., n = 8 frogs), which were reduced or blocked by EMI, applied to the nerve via an induction coil, from a d.c. source of 1.5-4 V, at a frequency of 100 min-1, for 2- to 4-min duration. Recovery of the blocked twitches was obtained within 4-5 min, after the cessation of the EMI and washing out the preparation in Ringer solution. The inhibition of the twitch tension by EMI was compared to that produced by an effective concentration of a local anaesthetic, lignocaine (1 microM), which is known to block conduction, by blocking ionic fluxes across the nerve membrane. It is possible that EMI also interferes with the ionic fluxes, and in prolonged duration, may produce changes in the myelin sheath (or the Schwann cells) of the nerve membrane. A comparison of ES with EMI was made, and it was concluded that EMI inhibited electrically induced neuromuscular transmission at the frog neuromuscular junction.",Excluded,0.08604972
4468,"Sex differences in neurochemical effects of dopaminergic drugs in rat striatum Previous data indicate that dopamine neurotransmission is differently regulated in male and female rats. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the dopamine transporter and autoreceptor as potential loci responsible for this sex difference. Fast cyclic voltammetry at carbon-fiber microelectrodes was used to monitor changes in electrically evoked levels of extracellular dopamine in the striata of anesthetized male and female rats before and after administration of an uptake inhibitor, a dopamine D2 antagonist, or a D3/D2 agonist. Administration of 40 mg/kg cocaine ip increased electrically-evoked extracellular dopamine concentrations in both sexes, but to a significantly greater extent in female striatum at the higher stimulation frequencies. The typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, increased dopamine efflux in both sexes but the effect was twice as large in the female striatum. The D3/D2 agonist quinpirole induced an unexpected, transient increase in dopamine efflux following high-frequency stimulation only in females, and evoked dopamine was higher in females across this entire time course. More detailed analysis of cocaine effects revealed no fundamental sex differences in the interaction of cocaine with DAT in vivo or in synaptosomes. These results indicate that nigrostriatal dopamine neurotransmission in the female rat is more tightly regulated by autoreceptor and transporter mechanisms, perhaps related by greater autoreceptor control of DAT activity. Thus, baseline sex differences in striatal dopamine regulation induce different pharmacologic responses. These results contribute to understanding sex differences in stimulant-induced locomotor activity in rats and may have broader implications for neurologic disorders and their pharmacotherapies in humans.",Excluded,0.08616662
4469,"Acute exposure to low-level light at night is sufficient to induce neurological changes and depressive-like behavior The advent and wide-spread adoption of electric lighting over the past century has profoundly affected the circadian organization of physiology and behavior for many individuals in industrialized nations; electric lighting in homes, work environments, and public areas have extended daytime activities into the evening, thus, increasing night-time exposure to light. Although initially assumed to be innocuous, chronic exposure to light at night (LAN) is now associated with increased incidence of cancer, metabolic disorders, and affective problems in humans. However, little is known about potential acute effects of LAN. To determine whether acute exposure to low-level LAN alters brain function, adult male, and female mice were housed in either light days and dark nights (LD; 14 h of 150 lux:10 h of 0 lux) or light days and low level light at night (LAN; 14 h of 150 lux:10 h of 5 lux). Mice exposed to LAN on three consecutive nights increased depressive-like responses compared to mice housed in dark nights. In addition, female mice exposed to LAN increased central tendency in the open field. LAN was associated with reduced hippocampal vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in both male and female mice, as well as increased VEGFR1 and interleukin-1beta mRNA expression in females, and reduced brain derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in males. Further, LAN significantly altered circadian rhythms (activity and temperature) and circadian gene expression in female and male mice, respectively. Altogether, this study demonstrates that acute exposure to LAN alters brain physiology and can be detrimental to well-being in otherwise healthy individuals.",Excluded,0.0857249

Ground studies on neonatal rats using the tail suspension model of weightlessness have shown that the force of gravity clearly influences the events underlying the postnatal development of motor function. These effects depend on the age of the animal, duration of the perturbation and the motor function studied. A nine-day flight study has shown that a dam and neonates can develop under conditions of space flight. The motor function of the flight animals after landing was consistent with that seen in the tail suspension studies, being marked by limb joint extension. However, there were expected differences due to: (1) the unloading of the vestibular system in flight, which did not occur in the ground-based experiments; (2) differences between flight and suspension durations; and (3) the inability to evaluate motor function during the flight. The next step is to conduct experiments in space with the flexibility and rigor that is now limited to ground studies: an opportunity offered by the International Space Station.",Excluded,0.10680311

The different skin reactions are described in detail because of their importance and frequency. Thus the acute skin lesions after high doses and the late effects resulting, either from high doses, or from accumulation of chronic irradiation, are studied. The main early syndromes are then characterized: neurological, gastro-intestinal, bone-marrow and prodromic. As far as the complex problem of radiocarcinogenesis is concerned, the main results derived from studies by international organizations such as the ICRP and the UNSCEAR are reported: risk coefficient of 5% per gray, for lethal radio-induced cancer, after total body irradiation, at low dose of low-LET radiation. The effects of irradiation in utero are then considered: risk of malformation after irradiation during the two first months of pregnancy and risk of mental retardation after irradiation during the third and the fourth months. Finally, the genetic risk is presented as being equal to one fourth of the risk of carcinogenesis at low-doses. The effects of irradiation on the gonads are also described.

Studies on possible radiation-induced AD-like pathogenesis and behavioral consequences are important because humans are exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) from various sources. It was reported that total-body irradiations (TBI) at 10 cGy of low linear energy transfer (LET) X-rays to mice triggered acute transcriptional alterations in genes associated with cognitive dysfunctions. However, it was unknown whether low doses of IR could induce AD-like changes late after exposure. We reported previously that 10 cGy X-rays induced early transcriptional response of several AD-related genes in hippocampi without late AD-like pathogenesis and memory impairment in mice. Here, further studies on two low doses (5 or 10 cGy) of high LET carbonion irradiations are reported. On expression of 84 AD-related genes in hippocampi, at 4 hr after TBI, 5 cGy induced a significant upregulation of three genes (Abca1, Casp3, and Chat) and 10 cGy led to a marked upregulation of one gene (Chat) and a downregulation of three genes (Apoe, Ctsd, and Il1alpha), and, at 1 year after TBI, one gene (Il1alpha) was significantly downregulated in 10 cGy-irradiated animals. Changes in spatial learning ability and memory and induction of AD-like pathogenesis were not detected by in vivo brain imaging for amyloid-beta peptide accumulation and by immunohistochemical staining of amyloid precursor protein, amyloid-beta protein, tau, and phosphorylated tau protein.

Early transcriptional response in murine brain to low-dose X-rays (100 mGy) has been reported, suggesting alterations of molecular networks and pathways associated with cognitive functions, advanced aging and AD. To investigate acute and late transcriptional, pathological and cognitive consequences of low-dose radiation, we applied an acute dose of 100-mGy total body irradiation (TBI) with X-rays to C57BL/6J Jms mice. We collected hippocampi and analyzed expression of 84 AD-related genes. Mouse learning ability and memory were assessed with the Morris water maze test.

4478,"Differential expression of KCC2 accounts for the differential GABA responses between relay and intrinsic neurons in the early postnatal rat olfactory bulb The rat olfactory bulb is anatomically immature at birth, and considerable neurogenesis and synaptogenesis are known to take place postnatally. In addition, significant physiological changes have also been reported in this period. For example, granule cell-mediated inhibition following electrical stimulations to the lateral olfactory tract is robust during the first postnatal week, and then decreases abruptly after the second week. However, the mechanism underlying this enhanced inhibition remains to be elucidated. To know the cause of this phenomenon, we investigated the expression patterns of cation-Cl(-) co-transporters (KCC1, KCC2 and NKCC1) mRNAs, which are responsible for the regulation of [Cl(-)](i). In addition, responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were measured by gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp recordings and Ca(2+) imaging using fura-2. We found that in the early postnatal period, mitral cells expressing KCC2 mRNA were inhibited by GABA, while granule cells lacking KCC2 mRNA expression were depolarized or excited by GABA. These results indicate that transient GABA-mediated excitation on granule cells might be the main cause of the enhanced inhibition on mitral cells, and suggest that these differential GABA responses between relay and intrinsic neurons play pivotal roles in the early postnatal rat olfactory bulb.",Excluded,0.086947314

We evaluated local control of extra-cranial metastases from RCC treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). Method(s): RCC patients with extracranial metastases treated with SABR were retrospectively enrolled from a single institution between 2005 and 2015. A total of 188 lesions were identified from 91 patients. Radiation (8-60Gy) was delivered in 1-5 fractions (fx) using stereotactic guidance. Local control (LC) was determined by imaging according to RECIST 1.1. Result(s): Median age at the time of treatment was 62.4 years. Metastases were detected in bone (39.9%), lung (14.9%), liver (9.6%), lymph nodes (11.7%) and other sites (23.9%). Ninety-seven (51.6%) lesions reached curative intent while 91 (48.4%) only reached palliative intent. The most common radiation regimens were 20Gy/1fx, 30Gy/3fx, and 40Gy/5fx. One-year overall survival was 76.5% with a median follow up of 10.7 months. Patients treated with curative SABR showed a 2-fold median survival as compared to those treated with palliative therapy (3.97 year vs 1.43 year, p<0.05). LC rates at 1 and 2 years were 91.4% and 89.7%, respectively. For the patients that failed, median time to local failure was 6.6 months. LC at 1 year significantly improved when treatment was curative (96.1% vs 84.9%, p<0.05), while it decreased in a re-irradiation setting (94.8% vs 46.7%, p<0.05). The median biological equivalent dose (BED) for the lesions that failed was 103Gy, corresponding to 6Gy x 5fx, and was significantly lowered compared to controlled lesions (BED 134Gy). Although 79% of patients developed new lesions within 1 year following SABR, 34.8% did not switch systemic therapy. Switching systemic therapy was delayed in patients treated with curative as compared to palliative SABR (13.4 vs 2.5 months, p<0.05).

Method(s): HT and VMAT treatment plans were generated with a prescription dose of 30Gy/10 fractions in 16 patients treated with PCI. The dosimetry parameters of BHT, organs at risk (OARs), and planning target volume (PTV) were determined when the average dose of BHT was reduced by about 4Gy to serve as an observation point. Statistical plots were used to present dosimetry changing trends when sparing the BHT with both HT and VMAT technologies. Result(s): HT plans spared BHT V7.3Gy by up to 40%, with the average Dmean-BHT = 8.42+/-0.41Gy, while VMAT plans failed to spare BHT V7.3Gy by such an amount. HT authored significantly lower doses to OARs, including Dmean-BHT (HT 16.37Gy vs. VMAT 17.81Gy, P=0.03), Dmean-inner ear (P=0.02), Dmean-parotid glands (P=0.02), Dmax-lens (P=0.02), and Dmax-brainstem (P=0.02), except for Dmax-optic nerves (P=0.87), compared to VMAT. Also, compared to VMAT, HT plans provided better target coverage, with lower average D2% (P=0.02), higher average D98% (P=0.02), and better conformal index (0.87 vs. 0.84, P=0.02) and homogeneity index (0.15 vs. 0.21, P=0.05). With smaller BHT doses, the dose distribution to PTV occurred in three dosimetry regions for both HT and VMAT plans; the plateau region (>20.0Gy for HT vs >16.0Gy for VMAT), gradient region (20.0-12.0Gy vs 16.0-11.0Gy), and falling region (<12.0Gy vs <11.0Gy). The average delivery duration for HT was determined at almost 7.7 times longer than VMAT.

Levels of pineal gland melatonin were measured twice daily--10:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.--10 days after initial light treatment. Thirty additional guinea pigs were also assigned to these groups and treated similarly. For these latter animals, refractive status, ocular length, and vitreous depth were measured before and after light treatment. Eight weeks after light treatment, retinal and sceral levels of melanopsin, melatonin receptor type (MT) 1, and mRNA protein were determined by Western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: The level of pineal gland melatonin in the green-light group was significantly higher than that in the blue-light group. Biometric measurements showed that guinea pigs in the green-light group had a somewhat myopic refractive status. Expressions of retinal melanopsin mRNA and protein were significantly higher in the blue-light group and lower in the green-light group when compared to controls. Conversely, expressions of MT1 receptor mRNA and protein in retina and sclera were significantly higher in the green-light group and lower in the blue-light group when compared to controls.CONCLUSIONS: Green light appears to suppress induction of melatonin production.

The data and parameters were analyzed by the cosine function software, Clock Lab software, and the amplitude F test was used to reveal the circadian rhythm. In the DD or LD condition, both the Clock and NAT mRNA levels in the pineal gland showed robust circadian oscillation (p<0.05) with the peak at the subjective night or at nighttime. In comparison with the DD regime, the amplitudes and mRNA levels at the peaks of Clock and NAT expressions in LD in the pineal gland were significantly reduced (p<0.05). In the DD or LD condition, the circadian expressions of NAT were similar in pattern to those of Clock in the pineal gland (p>0.05).

To gain further insights into the role of NO in retinal function, we made whole-cell patch clamp recordings from ganglion cells of neural type nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) gene knockout mice. Here we show that in the dark-adapted state, the sensitivity of retinal ganglion cell to light stimulation is decreased in nNOS knockout animals. The lowest light intensities required to evoke optimal responses and the average intensities that evoked half-maximal responses were significantly higher in nNOS knockouts than in normal mice. Retinal histology and other features of light-evoked responses of ganglion cells in nNOS mice appeared to be indistinguishable from those of normal mice. Collectively, these results, in conjunction with our previous work, provide evidence that increasing levels of NO dampen visual responses of ganglion cells, while a lack of nNOS decreases the sensitivity of these neurons to light. Thus, NO levels in the retina are capable of modulating the information that ganglion cells convey to the visual centers of the brain.",Excluded,0.08612843
4486,"Extended adjuvant temozolomide improves survival in a glioblastoma mouse model Glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM patients in conjunction with ionizing radiation (IR) or as an adjuvant agent. Yet the prognosis of GBM remains devastating with a median survival of 14 months. We investigated whether extended TMZ treatment cycles would provide survival benefit for GBM patients. To recapitulate the genomic and pathological heterogeneity found in GBM patients, we utilized patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. We demonstrated that the combination of TMZ and IR prevents tumor progression, but tumors ultimately recur and lead to death. Overall survival was prolonged when adjuvant TMZ treatment was administered with minimal toxicity. Additionally, development of resistance to TMZ and IR was often correlated with an increase in levels of MGMT protein, irrespective of the promoter methylation status. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of a voxel-based MRI biomarker, the functional diffusion map (fDM), as an imaging surrogate to detect spatially varying changes in tumor response, as well as a more sensitive predictor of overall response versus whole-volume tumor measurements. The fDM biomarker was also useful as an early predictor of impeding resistance to TMZ and IR. In summary, we demonstrate that prolonged TMZ treatment should be considered for the treatment of GBM patients. Furthermore, MRI based imaging allows early prediction of therapy response as well as impeding resistance.",Excluded,0.08587217
4487,"Chronic morphine exposure impairs short-term synaptic depression of geniculo-cortical visual pathway in vivo Chronic morphine exposure can induce addiction and affect synaptic plasticity, but the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unknown. Two forms of short-term synaptic depression (paired-pulse depression (PPD) and frequency depression) were investigated in vivo in the geniculo-cortical visual pathway of morphine-treated and saline-treated (as control) adult rats. Acute exposure to morphine had no effect on paired-pulse synaptic depression and 10-40 Hz induced frequency synaptic depression. However, chronic morphine exposure reduced markedly the paired-pulse depression and frequency depression at 40 Hz. The effect of chronic morphine exposure on short-term synaptic plasticity in the geniculo-cortical visual pathway was sensitization given that morphine re-exposure further significantly reduced the short-term synaptic depression. Interestingly, the further reduction in short-term synaptic depression due to re-exposure of morphine was recovered to normal (control) levels at 3 to 6h after morphine re-exposure. These findings suggest that chronic morphine treatment could significantly degrade the short-term synaptic plasticity of geniculo-cortical visual pathway.",Excluded,0.08651494
4488,"Radiation-induced changes in nucleoid halo diameters of aerobic and hypoxic SF-126 human brain tumor cells Nucleoid halo diameters were measured to assay changes in DNA supercoiling in human brain tumor cell line SF-126 after irradiation under aerobic or hypoxic conditions. In unirradiated aerobic cells, a typical propidium iodide titration curve showed that with increasing concentrations of propidium iodide, the halo diameter increased and then decreased with the unwinding and subsequent rewinding of DNA supercoils. In irradiated cells, the rewinding of DNA supercoils was inhibited, resulting in an increased halo diameter, in a radiation dose-dependent manner. To produce equal increases in halo diameter required about a threefold higher radiation dose in hypoxic cells than in aerobic cells. Quantitatively similar differences in the radiation sensitivities of hypoxic and aerobic cells were demonstrated by a colony-forming efficiency assay. These findings suggest that the nucleoid halo assay may be used as a rapid measure of the inherent radiation sensitivity of human tumors.",Excluded,0.42042926
4489,"Effect of Fiberoptic Collimation Technique on 808 nm Wavelength Laser Stimulation of Cochlear Neurons OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of fiberoptic collimation technique on auditory neural stimulation in the cochlea with 808 nm wavelength lasers.BACKGROUND DATA: Recently, the pulsed near-infrared lasers in the 800-1000 nm wavelength range have been investigated as an emerging technique to trigger auditory neural response in the cochlea. A laser beam divergence in the optical stimulation pathway exists, which may affect stimulation efficiency and spatial selectivity.METHODS: The fiberoptic collimation technique was proposed for cochlear neuron stimulation, and the C-lens element was designed as the collimation structure. The spiral ganglion cells in deafened guinea pigs' cochlea were irradiated with collimated and uncollimated near-infrared lasers. Optically evoked auditory brainstem response (OABR) under the two laser output modes were recorded.RESULTS: Laser with the collimation technique evoked an average 58% higher OABR amplitude than the uncollimated laser output. In addition, the collimated laser setup consumed on average 35.2% of laser energy compared with the uncollimated laser when evoking the same OABR amplitude.CONCLUSIONS: The fiberoptic collimation technique improved stimulation efficiency and reduced stimulating energy consumption in near-infrared neural stimulation in cochlea. The positive effects of laser collimation technique could benefit further research in optically based cochlear implants.",Excluded,0.08618602
4490,"Dual-source Flash scanning model CTA combined iterative reconstruction in diagnosis of cerebrovascular lesions. [Chinese] Objective To explore the clinical application value of the second generation dual-source Flash scanning model CTA combined iterative reconstruction in diagnosis of cerebrovascular lesions. Methods Data of 105 patients with suspected cerebrovascular lesions who underwent dual-source Flash scanning model CTA combined iteration reconstruction for cerebral vessels were analyzed retrospectively. Taken 3D-DSA as the gold standards, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of the Flash scanning model CTA in diagnosis of cerebrovascular lesions were calculated. The differences between 3D-DSA and Flash scanning model CTA in diagnosis of cerebrovascular lesions were compared. Flash CTA radiation dose and contrast agent dosage were calculated. Results Among 105 patients, dual-source Flash scanning model CTA diagnosed 73 aneurysms in 60 cases, including 24 micro aneurysms, as well as 13 cases of arteriovenous malformation (AVM), 5 cases of internal carotid cavernous sinus leakage, 2 cases of venous malformation, 9 cases of arterial stenosis and 6 cases of moyamoya disease, while misdiagnosed 2 cases of micro aneurysms and missed 1 case of AVM located in distal area of middle cerebral artery. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of Flash scanning model CTA in diagnosis of cerebrovascular lesions was 98.94% (93/94), 81.82% (9/11), 97.89% (93/95), 90.00% (9/10)and 97.14% (102/105), respectively.

4492,"Comparison of tumor volume delineation on magnetic resonance/ positron emission tomography versus standard computed tomography for head and neck cancer: Is there added value? Purpose/Objective(s): Computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are commonly used in head and neck radiation treatment planning. Combined MRI and PET (MR/PET) offers the advantage of simultaneous acquisition of multimodality biological information and possibly improved spatial resolution. In this study we assessed the added value of gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation on MR/PET compared to the standard practice of GTV delineation on CT. Materials/Methods: We prospectively enrolled patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with chemoradiation therapy in an institutional review board-approved study. We performed 2 pretreatment scans: contrast-enhanced planning CT and gadolinium-enhanced MR/PET. Primary and nodal CT-based GTVs (GTV-CT) were delineated on planning CT scans. Treatments were delivered based on these volumes. Primary and nodal MR/PET-based tumor volumes were delineated retrospectively after treatment completion using anatomic MRI and metabolic PET information to form a biologic tumor volume (MRBTV). MRBTVs were delineated without knowledge of the GTV-CT (BM, AF). Accuracy of MRBTV contours was assessed by a neuroradiologist (BH). MR/PET scans were registered to planning CT scans and the MRBTV was transferred. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), a validated metric to evaluate spatial overlap, was calculated from the intersection and union of the GTV-CT (planning CT) and MRBTV (MR/PET). A DSC of 0.7 or greater was considered a ""good"" overlap. Doses received by the GTV-CT and MRBTV were compared. Result(s): Twelve patients completed a pretreatment planning CT and MR/PET. Primary disease site was oropharynx in 11 patients and larynx in 1 patient. Ten pts had evaluable primary tumor GTVs and 8 had evaluable nodal GTVs. For the primary GTV, mean GTV-CT was 12.9 mL and MRBTV was 13.3 mL. Mean primary GTV/BTV intersection was 8.1 mL, with a Dice ratio of 0.4. Dose received by at least 95% of the tumor volume (D95%) was 65.8 Gy for the primary GTV-CT versus 65.7 Gy for the primary MRBTV. For the nodal GTV, mean GTV-CT was 29.7 mL and MRBTV was 29.2 mL. Mean nodal MRBTV intersection was 19.7 mL with a Dice ratio of 0.5. D95% was 62.9 Gy for the nodal GTV-CT versus 61 Gy for the nodal MRBTV. Conclusion(s): MRBTV volumes were similar to GTV-CT but the spatial overlap was moderate. Despite only moderate spatial overlap, radiation dose received by the MRBTV was similar to that received by the GTV-CT. Most patients in our study had oropharyngeal primaries, for which the added sophistication of MRPET may not improve the quality of GTV delineation. MR/PET may show added value for primary tumors that are more difficult to delineate on CT, such as sinonasal, nasopharyngeal, and base of skull tumors.",Excluded,0.08776969

In a previous study, we found that EUS-guided implantation of iodine-125 ((125)I) around the celiac ganglia is a safe procedure and can induce apoptosis of local neurons in a porcine model.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of direct celiac ganglion irradiation with (125)I seeds for the relief of moderate to severe pain secondary to unresectable PC.DESIGN: Prospective study.SETTING: Single, tertiary care referral center.PATIENTS: This study enrolled consecutive patients who had moderate to severe pain resulting from biopsy-proven unresectable PC.INTERVENTION: All patients underwent EUS-guided direct celiac ganglion irradiation with (125)I seeds. Follow-up was conducted at least once weekly until death.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Blood parameters, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, mean analgesic (MS Contin [morphine sulfate]) consumption, and complications were evaluated during follow-up.RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with unresectable PC underwent the procedure. The mean number of seeds implanted in the celiac ganglion per patient was 4 (range 2-6). Immediately after the procedure, pain relief and analgesic consumption showed no significant changes compared with preoperative values. Six patients (26%) reported pain exacerbation. Two weeks later, the VAS score and mean analgesic consumption were significantly less than preoperative values. No procedure-related deaths or major complications occurred.LIMITATIONS: Uncontrolled study.CONCLUSIONS: EUS-guided direct celiac ganglion irradiation with (125)I seeds can reduce the VAS score and analgesic drug consumption in patients with unresectable PC.",Excluded,0.08636529

In this work, we report our comprehensive quality assurance (QA) procedure for commissioning this TPS. First, the accuracy of stereotaxy established with a body frame was checked to ensure accurate determination of a target position within the planning system. Second, the CT-to-electron density conversion curve used in the TPS was fitted to our site-specific measurement data to ensure the accuracy of dose calculation and measurement verification in a QA phantom. Using the QA phantom, the radiological path lengths were verified against known geometrical depths to ensure the accuracy of the ray-tracing algorithm. We also checked inter- and intraleaf leakage/transmission for adequate jaw settings. Measurements for dose verification were performed in various head/neck and prostate IMRT treatment plans using the patient-specific optimized fluence maps. Both ion chamber and film were used for point dose and isodose distribution verifications. To ensure that adjacent organs at risk receive dose within the expectation, we used the Monte Carlo method to calculate dose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for these organs at risk. The dosimetric accuracy satisfied the published acceptability criteria. The Monte Carlo calculations confirmed the measured dose distributions for target volumes. For organs located on the beam boundary or outside the beam, some differences in the DVHs were noticed. However, the plans calculated by both methods met our clinical criteria. We conclude that the accuracy of the XKnifetrade mark RT2 treatment-planning system is adequate for the clinical implementation of stereotactic IMRT.",Excluded,0.08584593
4495,"Electroacupuncture (EA) modulates the expression of NMDA receptors in primary sensory neurons in relation to hyperalgesia in rats N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor on the central terminals of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) appears to be playing an important role in the development of central sensitization related to persistent inflammatory pain. Acupuncture analgesia has been confirmed by numerous clinical observations and experimental studies to be a useful treatment to release different kinds of pains, including inflammatory pain and hyperalgesia. However, the underlying mechanisms of the analgesic effect of acupuncture are not fully understood. In the present study, using a rat model of inflammatory pain induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), we observed the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on animal behavior with regard to pain and the expression of a subunit of NMDA receptor (NR1) and isolectin B4 (IB4) in the neurons of the lumbar DRG. Intraplantar injection of 50 microl CFA resulted in considerable changes in thermal hyperalgesia, edema of the hind paw and ""foot-bend"" score, beginning 5 h post-injection and persisting for a few days, after which a gradual recovery occurred. The changes were attenuated by EA treatment received on the ipsilateral ""Huan Tiao"" and ""Yang Ling Quan"" once a day from the first day post-injection of CFA. Using an immunofluorescence double staining, we found that the number of double-labeled cells to the total number of the IB4 and NR1-labeled neurons increased significantly on days 3 and 7 after CFA injection. The change was attenuated by EA treatment. These results suggest that EA affects the progress of experimental inflammatory pain by modulating the expression of NMDA receptors in primary sensory neurons, in particular, IB4-positive small neurons.",Excluded,0.08648708

In fly photoreceptor cells, the PLCbeta encoded by norpA is critical for activation of TRP channels. Here, we describe a PLCbeta regulator, STOPS, which encodes a SOCS box protein. Mutation of stops resulted in a reduced concentration of NORPA and a defect in stopping signaling following cessation of the light stimulus. NORPA has been proposed to have dual roles as a PLC- and GTPase-activating protein (GAP). We found that the slow termination resulting from expressing low levels of wild-type NORPA was suppressed by addition of normal amounts of an altered NORPA, which had wild-type GAP activity, but no PLC activity. STOPS is the first protein identified that specifically regulates PLCbeta protein concentration.

4504,"Macrophage attenuation of neuronal excitability: implications for pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders Brain macrophages (and microglia) play a crucial role in central nervous system immune and inflammatory responses. They are also critical cells in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. To understand how macrophages cause neural cell dysfunction, we investigated the effects of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) on rat cortical neuronal physiology in a BMDM-neuronal co-culture system using whole-cell patch clamp techniques. When co-cultured with neuronal cells, BMDMs hyperpolarized the neuronal membrane and attenuated both spontaneous and electrically evoked firings through a decrease in membrane input resistance. The average duration of evoked action potentials (APs) and the latency to fire the APs, in response to a constant depolarizing current injection, were significantly increased by BMDMs. These results indicate that BMDMs attenuate neuronal excitability. Further investigation revealed that BMDMs hyperpolarize neuronal membranes by enhancing neuronal delayed rectifier potassium current (IK), which was blocked by tetraethylammonium. This BMDM-induced attenuation on neuronal excitability may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuronal dysfunction and damage as seen in neurodegenerative disorders.",Excluded,0.08576992
4505,"Bidirectional regulation of fragile X mental retardation protein phosphorylation controls rhodopsin homoeostasis Homoeostatic regulation of the light sensor, rhodopsin, is critical for the maintenance of light sensitivity and survival of photoreceptors. The major fly rhodopsin, Rh1, undergoes light-induced endocytosis and degradation, but its protein and mRNA levels remain constant during light/dark cycles. It is not clear how translation of Rh1 is regulated. Here, we show that adult photoreceptors maintain a constant, abundant quantity of ninaE mRNA, which encodes Rh1. We demonstrate that the Fmr1 protein associates with ninaE mRNA and represses its translation. Further, light exposure triggers a calcium-dependent dephosphorylation of Fmr1, which relieves suppression of Rh1 translation. We demonstrate that Mts, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), mediates light-induced Fmr1 dephosphorylation in a regulatory B subunit of PP2A (CKa)-dependent manner. Finally, we show that blocking light-induced Rh1 translation results in reduced light sensitivity.

4507,"Hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery: a new treatment strategy for giant cavernous sinus hemangiomas OBJECTIVE Cavernous sinus hemangiomas (CSHs) are rare benign vascular tumors that arise from the dural venous sinuses lateral to the sella. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has emerged as a principal alternative to microresection for small- and medium-sized CSHs. Resection is a reasonable option for large (3-4 cm in diameter) and giant (> 4 cm in diameter) CSHs. However, management of giant CSHs remains a challenge for neurosurgeons because of the high rates of morbidity and even death that stem from uncontrollable and massive hemorrhage during surgery. The authors report here the results of their study on the use of hypofractionated SRS (H-SRS) to treat giant CSH. METHODS Between January 2008 and April 2014, 31 patients with a giant CSH (tumor volume > 40 cm<sup>3</sup>, > 4 cm in diameter) treated using CyberKnife radiosurgery were enrolled in a cohort study. Clinical status and targeted reduction of tumor volume were evaluated by means of serial MRI. The diagnosis for 27 patients was determined on the basis of typical imaging features. In 4 patients, the diagnosis of CSH was confirmed histopathologically. The median CSH volume was 64.4 cm<sup>3</sup> (range 40.9-145.3 cm<sup>3</sup>). Three or 4 sessions of CyberKnife radiosurgery were used with a prescription dose based on the intent to cover the entire tumor with a higher dose while ensuring dose limitation to the visual pathways and brainstem. The median marginal dose to the tumor was 21 Gy (range 19.5-21 Gy) in 3 fractions for 11 patients and 22 Gy (range 18-22 Gy) in 4 fractions for 20 patients. RESULTS The median duration of follow-up was 30 months (range 6-78 months) for all patients. Follow-up MRI scans revealed a median tumor volume reduction of 88.1% (62.3%-99.4%) at last examination compared with the pretreatment volume. Ten patients developed new or aggravated temporary headache and 5 experienced vomiting during the treatment; these acute symptoms were relieved completely after steroid administration. Among the 30 patients with symptoms observed before treatment, 19 achieved complete symptomatic remission, and 11 had partial remission. One patient reported seizures, which were controlled after antiepileptic drug administration. No radiation-induced neurological deficits or delayed complications were reported during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Hypofractionated SRS was an effective and safe modality for treating giant CSH. Considering the risks involved with microsurgery, it is possible that H-SRS might be able to serve as a definitive primary treatment option for giant CSH.",Excluded,0.087035105

Magnetic resonance imaging showed peripheral enhancing lesions with slight mass effect and surrounding edema. Microscopically, the major changes included coagulative necrosis, fibrinoid necrosis of vessels, vascular hyalinization with luminal stenosis and peripheral reactive gliosis. Immunostaining for hypoxia-inducible factors 1alpha was positive in reactive astrocytes.CONCLUSIONS: Delayed radiation-induced brain injury is a relatively common complication of radiation therapy.

The aim of this study is to determine if the deferral of brain radiotherapy impacts patient outcomes.METHODS: Between May 2003 and December 2015, a total of 198 patients with brain metastases from NSCLC who received both brain radiotherapy and systemic therapy (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) were identified. The rate of grade 3-4 adverse reactions related to chemotherapy and radiotherapy had no significant difference between two groups. 127 patients received concurrent brain radiotherapy and systemic therapy, and 71 patients received deferred brain radiotherapy after at least two cycles of chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Disease specific-graded prognostic assessment was similar in early radiotherapy group and deferred radiotherapy group.RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) was longer in early radiotherapy group compared to deferred radiotherapy group (17.9 months vs 12.6 months; P=0.038). Progression free survival (PFS) was also improved in patients receiving early radiotherapy compared to those receiving deferred radiotherapy (4.0 months vs 3.0 months; P<0.01). Receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy after the diagnosis of brain metastases as any line therapy improved the OS (20.0 months vs 10.7 months; P<0.01), whereas receiving TKI as first line therapy did not (17.9 months vs 15.2 months; P=0.289).CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the use of deferred brain radiotherapy may resulted in inferior OS in patients with NSCLC who develop brain metastases.

4510,"To optimize the CT scanner in SPECT/CT equipment of Nuclear medicine Objective: Since the invention of SPECT/CT, more and more nuclear medicine physicians are adding the CT scanner to improve the efficiency of diagnosis. However, in order to improve the diagnostic accuracy, in the meantime, also increase the patients' radiative dose. Summarized empirical Methods from the previous practice work, we hope to draw an optimized scheme of CT scanner, to reduce patients' radiation doses and dicrease the exposure time of the CT Tube. Method(s): To optimize voltage, current, exposure time, front and back of collimator, pitch factor, matrix and a series of acquisition parameters, we analysis the continuous clinical examples in four months, change the different levels of parameter sloely, and retrospect the CT radiative dose. We also compare to the quality of the image and constantly try to optimize the improvement. In the meantime, we statistics the monthly CT Bulb exposure time, exposure time per capita tube data and so on. Result(s): Compared with former optimization, the average CT radiational dose per person is decreased by 84.72%, Which conventional bone group radiation reduced by 83.82% (t = 24.362, P<0.001), the small joints of the bone group radiation reduced by 88.80% (t = 24.914, P<0.001), cerebral group radiation reduced by 86.78% (t = 61.008, P<0.001), the heart group radiation reduced by 84.49% (t = 52.994, P<0.001), the differences are statistically significant.

4511,"Semisupervised Tripled Dictionary Learning for Standard-Dose PET Image Prediction Using Low-Dose PET and Multimodal MRI OBJECTIVE: To obtain high-quality positron emission tomography (PET) image with low-dose tracer injection, this study attempts to predict the standard-dose PET (S-PET) image from both its low-dose PET (L-PET) counterpart and corresponding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).METHODS: It was achieved by patch-based sparse representation (SR), using the training samples with a complete set of MRI, L-PET and S-PET modalities for dictionary construction. However, the number of training samples with complete modalities is often limited. In practice, many samples generally have incomplete modalities (i.e., with one or two missing modalities) that thus cannot be used in the prediction process. In light of this, we develop a semisupervised tripled dictionary learning (SSTDL) method for S-PET image prediction, which can utilize not only the samples with complete modalities (called complete samples) but also the samples with incomplete modalities (called incomplete samples), to take advantage of the large number of available training samples and thus further improve the prediction performance.RESULTS: Validation was done on a real human brain dataset consisting of 18 subjects, and the results show that our method is superior to the SR and other baseline methods.CONCLUSION: This paper proposed a new S-PET prediction method, which can significantly improve the PET image quality with low-dose injection.SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed method is favorable in clinical application since it can decrease the potential radiation risk for patients.",Excluded,0.08628943
4512,"Short-term synaptic depression and recovery at the mature mammalian endbulb of Held synapse in mice The endbulb of Held synapses between the auditory nerve fibers (ANF) and cochlear nucleus bushy neurons convey fine temporal information embedded in the incoming acoustic signal. The dynamics of synaptic depression and recovery is a key in regulating synaptic transmission at the endbulb synapse. We studied short-term synaptic depression and recovery in mature (P22-38) CBA mice with stimulation rates that were comparable to sound-driven activities recorded in vivo. Synaptic depression in mature mice is less severe ( approximately 40% at 100 Hz) than reported for immature animals and the depression is predominately due to depletion of releasable vesicles. Recovery from depression depends on the rate of activity and accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ at the presynaptic terminal. With a regular stimulus train at 100 Hz in 2 mM external [Ca2+], the recovery from depletion was slow (tauslow, approximately 2 s). In contrast, a fast (taufast, approximately 25 ms), Ca2+-dependent recovery followed by a slower recovery (tauslow, approximately 2 s) was seen when stimulus rates or external [Ca2+] increased. In normal [Ca2+], recovery from a 100-Hz Poisson-like train is rapid, suggesting that Poisson-like trains produce a higher internal [Ca2+] than regular trains. Moreover, the fast recovery was slowed by approximately twofold in the presence of calmidazolium, a Ca2+/calmodulin inhibitor. Our results suggest that endbulb synapses from high spontaneous firing rate auditory nerve fibers normally operate in a depressed state. The accelerated synaptic recovery during high rates of activity is likely to ensure that reliable synaptic transmission can be achieved at the endbulb synapse.",Excluded,0.08577266
4513,"The alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist TC-2559 impairs long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus in vivo Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) are widely expressed throughout the nervous system, are involved in some fast excitatory neurotransmission, and play an important role in modulating the release of several neurotransmitters, including the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA. We used a recently characterised alpha4beta2 nAChR subunit selective partial agonist, TC-2559, to study the effect of alpha4beta2 nAChR activation on synaptic plasticity in the medio-dorsal perforant pathway input to the dentate gyrus, in the intact nervous system in vivo. We show for the first time, that the selective activation of alpha4beta2 containing nAChR can reduce the level of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high frequency stimulation, an effect that was reversed by the selective antagonist, dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DbetaHE).

4514,"3D conditional generative adversarial networks for high-quality PET image estimation at low dose Positron emission tomography (PET) is a widely used imaging modality, providing insight into both the biochemical and physiological processes of human body. Usually, a full dose radioactive tracer is required to obtain high-quality PET images for clinical needs. This inevitably raises concerns about potential health hazards. On the other hand, dose reduction may cause the increased noise in the reconstructed PET images, which impacts the image quality to a certain extent. In this paper, in order to reduce the radiation exposure while maintaining the high quality of PET images, we propose a novel method based on 3D conditional generative adversarial networks (3D c-GANs) to estimate the high-quality full-dose PET images from low-dose ones. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) include a generator network and a discriminator network which are trained simultaneously with the goal of one beating the other. Similar to GANs, in the proposed 3D c-GANs, we condition the model on an input low-dose PET image and generate a corresponding output full-dose PET image. Specifically, to render the same underlying information between the low-dose and full-dose PET images, a 3D U-net-like deep architecture which can combine hierarchical features by using skip connection is designed as the generator network to synthesize the full-dose image. In order to guarantee the synthesized PET image to be close to the real one, we take into account of the estimation error loss in addition to the discriminator feedback to train the generator network. Furthermore, a concatenated 3D c-GANs based progressive refinement scheme is also proposed to further improve the quality of estimated images. Validation was done on a real human brain dataset including both the normal subjects and the subjects diagnosed as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Experimental results show that our proposed 3D c-GANs method outperforms the benchmark methods and achieves much better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative measures.",Excluded,0.08632618

4516,"Challenges and practicalities in the clinical implementation of Lutetium 177 for therapeutic nuclear medicine: A technologist's perspective Objectives: FDA approval of Lutetium177 (Lu177) treatment of neuroendocrine tumor is pending. Lu177 therapy is logistically different than any other currently used radionuclide therapeutic agent. We aim to present a technologist's perspective on potential challenges related to the implementation of Lu177 therapy including developing an institution's policy, identifying needed location/space, supplies, and staff requirements. Method(s): A Lu177 treatment regimen consists of 4 intravenous infusions of 200 mCi at 8 week intervals. Each therapeutic infusion is 4-6 hours, consists of the Lu177 infusion along with an infusion of amino acids and requires nursing supervision. During this process, to reduce radiation exposure, the patient must walk to the restroom every thirty minutes with an IV pole to void. The technologists met with the Authorized Users (AU), the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO), and the other staff involved to review the requirements of radiation safety, workflow, and protocol of this therapy. Result(s): The radioactive materials license is to be amended. It was determined that Lu177 administration would ideally occur in our PET division due to department layout and patient flow. While the general nuclear medicine department has an injection room suited for therapeutic use, the restroom is not in close proximity, which is a radiation safety concern. In our PET center, there are 2 comfortable injection rooms used for long uptake periods located next to a restroom dedicated for radioactive patients. Due to the stated length of the Lu177 therapy session, the PET diagnostic schedule will be reduced on Lu177 therapy days. Lu177 therapies will be scheduled in coordination with other departments including oncology; pharmacy for obtaining amino acids; and nursing for the administration of IV fluids and vital sign monitoring. After the infusion is completed and the injection room is cleaned, radioactive waste will be moved to long term storage. Conclusion(s): Lu177 therapy is an exciting new development in the field of radionuclide therapy: however, its implementation brings new challenges to meet both radiation safety and protocol requirements. Space, workflow, and staffing must all be considered. Lu177 therapies will involve the coordination of AUs, the RSO, technologists, nursing staff, pharmacist, and logistics personnel.

The intratemporal facial nerve (IFN) is exposed to higher levels of cellular telephone radiation than intracranial tissues. The purpose of the study was to determine whether cellular telephone use is associated with an increased risk of IFN tumors.STUDY DESIGN: Case-control using a structured telephone survey at an academic, tertiary-care referral center.METHODS: Patients with IFN tumors (n = 18) were case-matched with patients treated for acoustic neuroma (n = 51), rhinosinusitis (n = 72), and dysphonia or gastroesophageal reflux disease (n = 69). Risk of facial nerve tumorigenesis was compared by extent of cellular telephone use and other risk factors.RESULTS: The odds ratio of developing an IFN tumor was 0.6 (95% CI, 0.2-1.9) with any handheld cellular telephone use and 0.4 (95% CI, 0.1-2.1) with regular cellular telephone use. No factors were associated with an increased risk for IFN tumor development.CONCLUSIONS: Regular cellular telephone use does not appear to be associated with a higher risk of IFN tumor development.

4519,"Transient dephosphorylation of p53 serine 376 as an early response to ionizing radiation In a previous paper we reported that the cytoplasmic sequestered p53 in cells of the SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell line could be induced to translocate to the nucleus by exposure to ionizing radiation. We have extended these studies to determine the fate of p53 in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells where constitutive p53 protein resides in the nucleus. A continuous increase in the nuclear p53 protein was observed in irradiated cells beginning 1 h after irradiation that persisted for 8 h. Surprisingly, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a transient, rapid and sensitive increase in a radiation-induced nuclear dephosphorylated p53 using antibody PAb421, which detects p53 when serine 376 is dephosphorylated. The PAb421 epitope was detectable after exposure to radiation doses as low as 0.5 cGy and was 10 to 20 times more sensitive compared to detection of p53 protein levels. The results are consistent with a radiation-induced, sensitive and rapid dephosphorylation of p53 at serine 376. The rapid increase in the nuclear PAb421 epitope was blocked by the protein serine phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A but was not blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, suggesting that serine 376 was dephosphorylated by protein serine phosphatase 1 or 2A acting on pre-existing p53 protein. The data suggest that dephosphorylation of serine 376 on constitutive nuclear p53 is a sensitive and early signaling event in the response of cells to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation.",Excluded,0.1528113
4520,"Daxx Functions Are p53-Independent In Vivo Mutations in the death domain-associated protein (DAXX) have been recently identified in a substantial proportion of human pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). Remarkably, however, little is known about the physiologic role(s) of DAXX despite in vitro studies suggesting potential functions. Most prominently, and supported by tumor sequencing data, DAXX functions in concert with alpha thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) as a histone chaperone complex for the H3.3 variant. Studies have also identified potential roles in apoptosis, transcription, and negative regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. Herein, a mouse modeling approach was used to specifically address the latter and no significant genetic interaction between Daxx and the p53 pathway was determined. The embryonic lethal phenotype of Daxx loss is not p53-dependent. In addition, Daxx heterozygosity does not sensitize mice to a sublethal dose of ionizing radiation or alter the survival or tumor phenotype of Mdm2 transgenic mice. However, the data support a tumor suppressor role for DAXX as low-dose ionizing radiation produced a higher proportion of carcinomas in Daxx heterozygous mice than wild-type controls. <b>Implications:</b> While DAXX has important in vivo functions, they are independent of an inhibitory role on the p53 tumor suppressor pathway.

Volumetric assessment of the dysmorphic acardiac twin with the Virtual Organ Computer-aided Analysis (VOCAL) software is more accurate than the conventional ultrasound measurement. Twin anemia polycythemia (TAP) sequence and selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) may be clinically monitored with 3DUS placental volume (PV) and power Doppler vascular indices. Congenital anomalies are more common in twins. Evaluation of fetal anomalies with 3DUS could assist perinatal management. The 3DUS power Doppler can provide a better understanding of true and false umbilical cord knots, which are commonly found in monoamniotic (MA) twins. Single demise in monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies can cause severe neurologic morbidity in the surviving co-twin. Prenatal prediction of brain injury in the surviving co-twin with unremarkable neurosonographic examination is difficult. The 3DUS power Doppler may aid in prenatal detection of subtle abnormal cerebral perfusion. Prenatal assessment of conjoined twins with 3DUS is important if emergency postnatal surgical separation is anticipated. There is no significant additional advantage in using real-time 3DUS to guide prenatal interventions. Assessment of the cervix and pelvic floor during twin pregnancies is enhanced with 3DUS. Due to lack of high-quality studies, routine prenatal 3DUS in twin pregnancies needs to be balanced with risks of excessive ultrasound exposure.

4522,"Inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase as a protective effect of nicaraven in ionizing radiation- and ara-C-induced cell death BACKGROUND: Nicaraven is a drug used for patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. It crosses the blood-brain barrier and has potent antivasospastic and brain-protective effects. While nicaraven scavenges the hydroxyl radical, the mechanism of its protection remains obscure. In addition to the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect, nicaraven also exhibits inhibitory action on poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The mechanism of the pharmacological action of nicaraven has not yet been clarified.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human myeloid HL-525 cells were exposed to ionizing radiation or hydrogen peroxide and the effect of nicaraven on the activation of the Egr-1 promoter was measured. Next, the action of the drug on DNA fragmentation and inhibition of thymidine uptake caused by the genotoxic stimulation of ionizing radiation or cytosine B-D-arabinofuranoside (ara-C) were assessed. Finally, direct inhibition of the PARP enzyme by nicaraven was measured.RESULTS: Nicaraven did not inhibit the activation of the Egr-1 promoter caused by H2O2 and the activation caused by ionizing radiation. However, the drug repressed DNA fragmentation and increased thymidine uptake dose-dependently. Nicaraven had a direct inhibitory effect on PARP.DISCUSSION: The effect of nicaraven on the Egr-1 promoter was different from that of another free-radical scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine. Nicaraven demonstrated similar protection of the PARP inhibitors including 3-aminobenzamide. Since nicaraven directly inhibits the PARP enzyme, the drug might be useful in oncology as well as in studying tissue-damaging conditions characterized by increased PARP activity.",Excluded,0.08642483

Previously, high doses of one of the boron compounds used for BNCT, L-BPA, were found to reduce the boron-derived irradiation dose to the central nervous system. However, injection with a high dose of L-BPA is not feasible in clinical settings. We aimed to find an alternative method to improve the therapeutic efficacy of this therapy. We examined the effects of oral preloading with various analogues of L-BPA in a xenograft tumour model and found that high-dose L-phenylalanine reduced the accumulation of L-BPA in the normal brain relative to tumour tissue. As a result, the maximum irradiation dose in the normal brain was 19.2% lower in the L-phenylalanine group relative to the control group.

4532,"Photoreceptor damage and eye pigmentation: influence on the sensitivity of rat pineal N-acetyltransferase activity and melatonin levels to light at night The threshold of light irradiance capable of inhibiting nighttime pineal serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and melatonin content, and the importance of intact photoreceptors and eye pigmentation on these changes, were investigated in the rat. Groups of intact albino and black-eyed rats and albino animals with light-induced photoreceptor damage were studied in the dark period before, and after 15 and 30 min of exposure to either 0.0005, 0.175 or 3.33 microW/cm2 irradiance of light. In animals with photoreceptor damage, the sensitivity of the pineal gland to light decreased so that only the highest irradiance tested (3.33 microW/cm2) was capable of totally inhibiting pineal NAT activity and melatonin levels. In one study, pineal NAT and melatonin levels in intact albino rats were inhibited by all three irradiances studied. In a second experiment, albino and black-eyed animals behaved identically, only responding with a depression in pineal NAT and melatonin after exposure to light irradiances of either 0.175 or 3.33 microW/cm2. In conclusion, the lowest irradiance of cool white light capable of inhibiting pineal NAT and melatonin in albino rats is around 0.0005 microW/cm2. At the irradiances studied, photoreceptor damage influences the response of pineal NAT and melatonin to acute light exposure at night. On the other hand, eye pigmentation does not seem to have a major effect on the nighttime inhibition of the pineal by light.",Excluded,0.086065546
4533,"Performance characteristics of alcohol-mediated endovascular renal denervation BACKGROUND Efficient and safe neurolysis is key to performing a successful renal denervation procedure. Chemical neurolysis based on the perivascular infusion of alcohol via endovascular technique represents a safe and effective method which includes performance characteristics essential to the procedure. METHODS The Peregrine SystemTM Infusion Catheter contains 3 micro-needles which are deployed through the media of an artery into the adventitial region. The device is directed into the renal arteries using standard endovascular techniques. A small volume of Dehydrated Alcohol (0.3 mL-0.6 mL) when infused through the catheter, distributes circumferentially and axially along the vessel. The infusion is performed at a single site of each renal artery. Alcohol is a well-characterized neurolytic agent and functions in a consistent, dose-dependent fashion by a combination of cellular dehydration, extraction of lipids, and precipitation of proteins of target tissue. Targeted delivery of the alcohol to the perivascular space ensures that the perirenal nerves are destroyed while preserving adjacent tissue. RESULTS No procedural vascular adverse events have been reported with the use of the Peregrine Catheter. The delivery mechanisms of the device are highly flexible and atraumatic. Alcohol, as a hygroscopic agent, distributes evenly at the site of infusion. Ablation depths of up to 13 mm, as measured from the IEL, are observed. Alcohol is distributed circumferentially around the vessel (with some variation due to adjacent anatomic structures) to form a 'cuff' surrounding the artery at the infusion site. An ablation area of up to 57 mm2 have been reported based on morphometric measurements. Renal norepinephrine has been reduced by 64%-86% compared to controls. Since a single deployment and infusion is required at each renal artery, procedure time, contrast, radiation exposure are all reduced. CONCLUSION Preclinical data has shown that endovascular alcohol mediated renal denervation using the Peregrine Catheter incorporates the performance characteristics required to produce more effective neurolysis of the sympathetic perirenal nerves. On-going and completed clinical trials continue to demonstrate promising results of both safety and effectiveness.",Excluded,0.08553449
4534,"[Monitoring of irradiated brain metastases using MR perfusion imaging and 1H MR spectroscopy] PURPOSE: In follow-up examinations of irradiated brain metastases conventional contrast-enhanced morphological MR imaging is often unable to distinguish between transient radiation effects, radionecrosis,and tumor recurrence. To evaluate changes of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in irradiated brain metastases arterial spin-labeling techniques (ASL) were applied and compared to the outcome of (1)H MR spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging ((1)H MRS, SI).PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2 patients follow-up examinations of irradiated brain metastases were performed on a 1.5-T tomograph (average single dose: 20 Gy/80% isodose). Relative CBF values of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM),and metastases (Met) were measured by means of the ASL techniques ITS-FAIR and Q2TIPS. (1)H MRS was performed with PRESS 1500/135.RESULTS: In both patients with initially hyperperfused metastases (Met/GM >1) the reduction of rCBF after stereotactic radiosurgery indicated response to treatment--even if the contrast-enhancing region increased--while increasing rCBF values indicated tumor progression. The findings were confirmed by (1)H MRS, SI and subsequent follow-up.CONCLUSION: The ASL techniques ITS-FAIR and Q2TIPS are able to monitor changes of rCBF in irradiated brain metastases. The two cases imply a possible role for ASL-MR perfusion imaging and (1)H MR spectroscopy in differentiating radiation effects from tumor progression.",Excluded,0.21465677
4535,"Therapeutic effect of m-[131I]- and m-[125I]iodobenzylguanidine on neuroblastoma multicellular tumor spheroids of different sizes m-[l25I]iodobenzylguanidine (m-[125I]MIBG) has been suggested as an alternative to m-[131I]MIBG for the treatment of metastatic neuroblastoma to achieve a higher radiation dose in micrometastases. To compare these two radiopharmaceuticals, a mathematical model was developed in the present study that allows for the calculation of radiation dose rates within small spherical tumors for different distributions of 131I and 125I. Furthermore, the relationship between tumor size and the therapeutic effects of m-[131I]- and m-[125I]MIBG was studied in vitro using multicellular tumor spheroids of the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH. According to the calculations, higher mean dose rates can be achieved by m-[125I]MIBG than by m-[131I]MIBG up to a tumor diameter of 100 microm when both substances are homogeneously distributed within the tumor. In larger tumors, however, mean dose rates achieved by 131I are up to 8-fold higher. Evaluation of various activity distributions demonstrated that even in tumors of less than 100 microm in diameter, marked heterogeneities of the dose rate can occur when m-[125I]MIBG is not distributed homogeneously. By treatment with m-[131I]MIBG, the growth of tumor spheroids ranging from 100 to 250 microm in diameter was inhibited more effectively in the larger than in the smaller spheroids. The growth inhibition of spheroids treated with m-[125I]MIBG was independent of the spheroid size. In consistency with the calculations, the therapeutic effect of m-[125I]- and m-[131I]MIBG was equal in spheroids with diameters of about 100 microm. In larger spheroids, m-[131I]MIBG induced a more pronounced delay in spheroid growth than m-[125I]MIBG. According to these calculations and in vitro data, m-[125I]MIBG as a single agent does not seem to be a promising alternative to m-[131I]MIBG for treatment of metastatic neuroblastoma. However, the combined use of m-[131I]- and m-[125I]MIBG may be more effective than treatment with m-[131I]MIBG alone.",Excluded,0.08684619
4536,"Surgical management of recurrent Rathke's cleft cysts Objective: Rathke's cleft cysts (RCCs) are benign epithelial lesions of the sellar region, frequently treated with cyst fenestration and drainage, via a transsphenoidal craniotomy (TSC) approach. While these lesions are benign, they have an appreciable recurrence rate. At present, the literature contains limited data regarding factors contributing to recurrence in patients treated for recurrent cysts. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective analysis of pathology-confirmed RCCs from 1995 to 2016 in our institutional database. TSC for cyst fenestration and drainage was our first-line therapy for symptomatic patients with open craniotomy or radiation as a salvage therapy. Result(s): We identified 112 surgeries for RCC in 101 patients. The mean age of patients presenting for reoperation was significantly higher than for patients presenting for their first operation (42.4 +/- 17 years vs. 58.6 +/- 17 years, p < 0.001). Ninety-one surgeries (80.5%) were primary operations and 21 surgeries in 18 patients (19.5%) were reoperations. Of the 91 patients who underwent their first operation at our institution, eight (8.7%) required reoperation for recurrence. Intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak repair was performed in 53% of cases and was more common in reoperation cases (71 vs. 48%, p < 0.04). There were no new neurological deficits or perioperative deaths; however, one patient developed an internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm requiring endovascular treatment. Two patients (9.5%) in the reoperation group developed a postoperative CSF leak, one of which resolved with lumbar drain and one of which required a reoperation. Of the 16 reoperation patients for whom data were available, 11/16 (68.6%) were on pituitary hormone supplementation prior to their reoperations, and 6/16 (37.5%) had diabetes insipidus (DI) requiring desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) at home. Of the 10 reoperation patients without DI prior to revision, the rates of transient hyponatremia (3/10 vs. 4/91, p < 0.04) and transient DI (5/10 vs. 17/91, p=0.04) were significantly higher in the reoperation group. The rate of new permanent DI was not higher for reoperation patients (2/10 vs. 4/91, p < 0.001). At the last clinical follow-up, 15% of patients reported worsened headaches, 52% reported unchanged headaches, and 33% reported improvement. Of the patients with visual deficits prior to surgery, 61.5% of patients reported improved vision, 30.8% of patients reported stable vision, and 7.7% of patients reported worsening of vision. RCC recurrence developed in 7/45 patients (15.6%) <40 years of age, compared with 22/64 patients (34.4%) =40 years of age (p < 0.04). Recurrence was observed in 4/10 RCCs (40%) with squamous metaplasia compared with 25/99 (25.2%) patients without squamous metaplasia (p=0.45). Recurrence was observed in 4/12 RCCs (33.3%) with inflammation which was not statistically different from the rates of recurrence in patients without inflammation 25/97 (25.7%, p=0.73). Conclusion(s): Reoperation for recurrent RCC is a safe and effective intervention for patients with recurrent visual symptoms or headaches. Many patients present with hypopituitarism, thus care should be taken to ensure adequate hormonal supplementation in the perioperative period. Additionally, patients should be counseled that hormonal recovery is unlikely and additional hormonal supplementation may be required following reoperation.

4537,"Postoperative radiotherapy for WHO grade II-III intracranial ependymoma in adults: An intergroup collaborative study (KROG 18-06/KNOG 18-01) Background and purpose: To evaluate the impact of adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in adult WHO grade II-III intracranial ependymoma (IEPN). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 172 pathologically confirmed adult grade II-III IEPN patients from 12 institutions were eligible. Of them, 106 (61.6%) and 66 (38.4%) patients were grade II and III, respectively. For grade II and III IEPNs, 51 (48.1%) and 59 (89.4%) patients received PORT, respectively. The median dose to the primary tumor bed was 54.0 Gy and 59.4 Gy for grade II and III patients, respectively. The prognostic impact of sex, age, performance, WHO grade, location, size, surgical extent, and PORT on local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): The median follow-up period for survivors was 88.1 months. The 5-/10-year LC, PFS, and OS rates were 64.8%/54.0%, 56.4%/44.8%, and 76.6%/71.0%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, adjuvant PORT significantly improved LC (P = 0.002), PFS (P = 0.002), and OS (P = 0.043). Older age (P < 0.001), WHO grade III (P < 0.001), larger tumor size (P = 0.004), and lesser surgical extent (P < 0.001) were also negative factors for OS. Adjuvant PORT also improved LC (P = 0.010), PFS (P = 0.007), and OS (P = 0.069) on multivariate analysis for grade II IEPNs. Conclusion(s): This multicenter retrospective study supports the role of adjuvant PORT in terms of disease control and survival in adult grade II-III IEPNs.

4538,"Event-triggered neuroadaptive control for postcapture spacecraft with ultralow-frequency actuator updates This paper investigates an event-triggered neuroadaptive control approach for postcapture flexible spacecraft with guaranteed prespecified tracking performance in the presence of unknown inertial properties, actuator constraints, and external space perturbations. By employing the minimum-learning parameter technique into the neural proportional integral-like controller, only two adaptive parameters are required to update online, which completely avoids the tedious inertial parameter identifications and dramatically reduces the complexity of controller in the meanwhile. Compared with existing works, the primary advantage of the proposed attitude control approach is that the actuator updates are determined by the prescribed event-based conditions in an aperiodic way rather than a periodic one, which greatly reduces the actuator updates. Finally, two groups of illustrative examples are organized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of attitude stabilization and tracking for the postcapture flexible spacecraft.

4539,"Research progress on mechanism and dosimetry of brainstem injury induced by intensity-modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy, and heavy ion radiotherapy Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective method for treating head and neck cancer (HNC). However, RT may cause side effects during and after treatment. Radiation-induced brainstem injury (BSI) is often neglected due to its low incidence and short survival time and because it is indistinguishable from intracranial tumor progression. It is currently believed that the possible mechanism of radiation-induced BSI includes increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and damage of vascular endothelial cells, neurons, and glial cells as well as an inflammatory response and oxidative stress. At present, it is still difficult to avoid BSI even with several advanced RT techniques. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is the most commonly used therapeutic technique in the field of RT. Compared with early conformal therapy, it has greatly reduced the injury to normal tissues. Proton beam radiotherapy (PBT) and heavy ion radiotherapy (HIT) have good dose distribution due to the presence of a Bragg peak, which not only results in better control of the tumor but also minimizes the dose to the surrounding normal tissues. There are many clinical studies on BSI caused by IMRT, PBT, and HIT. In this paper, we review the mechanism, dosimetry, and other aspects of BSI caused by IMRT, PBT, and HIT.Key Points* Enhanced MRI imaging can better detect radiation-induced BSI early.* This article summarized the dose constraints of brainstem toxicity in clinical studies using different techniques including IMRT, PBT, and HIT and recommended better dose constraints pattern to clinicians.* The latest pathological mechanism of radiation-induced BSI and the corresponding advanced treatment methods will be discussed.",Excluded,0.0867308

METHODS C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into seven groups (n=10): control group, LW-AFC group (1.6 g?kg<sup>-1</sup>), Liu Wei Di Huang Tang (LW) group (10 g-kg<sup>-1</sup>), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) group, irradiation group, irradiation+ LW group, and irradiation + LW-AFC group. Reduction of mice adult hippocampal neurogenesis was induced by cranial irradiation. LW-AFC was administered by oral gavage for 30 d after cranial irradiation treatment. Immunofluorescence and Nissl's staining were performed for histological morphology assessment. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining was used in the detection of proliferation cells. The peripheral blood and hippocampal homogenate were collected to measure the content of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (INF-y), interleukin-1 (3 (IL-1(3), IL-4 and IL-10. The hippocampal homogenate was used for Western blot to detect the BDNFkappaB signal pathway, including extracellular regulated protein kinases1/2 (ERK1/2) and BDNF target protein. Morris water maze and new object recognition test were performed to examine the cognitive function of mice. The mice forced swimming and tail suspension test were used to assess alteration in depressive behavior. Long term potentiation was used to examine the synaptic plasticity change of mice. RESULTS Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly reduced after irradiation of 20 Gray dose (10 Gray per day, total 2 d). LW-AFC treatment increased the BrdU number of irradiated mice (P<0.05). In Morris water maze test, LW-AFC group showed decreased escape latency in the learning period (P<0.05), while increased the number of crossing the platform in the memory period. LW-AFC can also reduce the immobility time of mice in the tail suspension test (P<0.01).

The effect of BI on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is not fully understood. Objective(s): To evaluate the effect of BI on HPA axis responses under basal and stressful conditions as well as following pretreatment with dexamethasone (Dex). Method(s): Adult male rats were exposed to whole BI. HPA axis responses were examined at 2, 4, 9 and 20 weeks after BI. Histological evaluations of the irradiated rats and matched controls were conducted at 4 and 20 weeks after BI. Result(s): In contrast to the control group, the basal and stress-induced corticosterone levels were enhanced at 9 and 20 weeks after BI and the inhibitory effect of Dex was reduced. BI also caused hyposuppression of the adrenocortical response to stress. Histological assessment of the irradiated brains revealed hippocampal atrophy at 20 weeks after BI. The neuronal counts were lower only in the CA1 region of the irradiated brains. BI caused a decrease in the binding capacity of Dex to the hippocampal cytosolic fraction. Conclusion(s): Enhanced stress-induced HPA axis responses and the reduced effect of Dex suggest that BI has delayed effects on HPA axis responses as manifested by impairment of the negative feedback exerted by glucocorticoids (GCs). The mechanisms underlying these effects of BI are unknown. It is possible that the marked BI-induced damage in the hippocampus, which plays an important role in the regulation of the feedback effect of GCs, may cause abnormal HPA axis responses following BI.

4544,"Identifying cognitive impairment in patients with primary malignant brain tumors (PBMT) INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment is one of the most disabling symptoms for individuals with PBMTs and has been identified as a major source of psychological distress by caregivers. Domain specific data regarding cognitive dysfunction following surgery is primarily from research conducted prior to the advent of current standards of care. The aims of this analysis were to identify specific domains of cognitive function most affected in the post-operative/treatment phases and to examine predictors of poor performance in those domains using a selected battery of neuropsychological tests. METHOD(S): Neuropsychological assessments were performed by trained examiners on patients (n=86) with a PMBT diagnosis that were recruited as part of a caregiver intervention trial (R01-NR013170). Domain-specific z-scores were created using published normative data for matching age groups and analyzed using Pearson's Chisquare and paired t-tests to evaluate univariate associations between age, gender, tumor location, type, grade and treatment status as potential predictors of cognitive impairment. RESULT(S): Participants were mostly male (59.2%), middle aged (mean 54.4, SD 15), with glioblastomas (55.4%) in the middle (40.8%) or frontal (35.4%) areas of the brain. The majority of participants had surgery (88.8%), chemo (62.3%), or radiation (65.6%) prior to assessment. Participant mean domain scores for Executive Function (z=-1.8), Verbal Memory (z=-1.5) and Aphasia (z=-0.8) fell below normative values indicating cognitive impairment. Age was significantly associated with impairment in Executive Function (p =.004) and Verbal Memory (p=.06). Further details of tumor type, location, and genetics will be discussed. CONCLUSION(S): This analysis shows that older patients with PMBTs are at particular risk for developing cognitive impairment in the specific areas of executive function and verbal memory. Clinicians should be aware of these risk factors, screen patients regularly for cognitive dysfunction in these areas and provide guidance to family caregivers on strategies to reduce the psychological distress associated with these impairments.",Excluded,0.8315134

METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database and identified 13 consecutive patients who underwent TR CAS from June 2019 through February 2020. Patients were divided into 2 groups: RA (6 patients) and manual (7 patients). RESULTS Among 6 patients in the RA group with a mean age of 70.0 +/- 7.2 years, technical success was achieved in all 6 (100%) procedures; there were no technical or access-site complications and no catheter exchanges. Transfemoral conversion was required in 1 (16.7%) case due to a tortuous aortic arch. There were no perioperative complications, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and mortality. The mean procedure duration was significantly longer in the RA group (85.0 +/- 14.3 minutes [95% CI 69.9-100.0] vs 61.2 +/- 17.5 minutes [95% CI 45.0-77.4], p = 0.0231). There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics, fluoroscopy time, contrast dose, radiation exposure, catheter exchanges, technical success, transfemoral conversion, technical or access-site complications, myocardial infarction, stroke, other complications, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS The authors' results suggest that RA TR CAS is feasible, safe, and effective. Neurovascular-specific engineering and software modifications are needed prior to complete remote control. Remote control has important implications regarding patient access to lifesaving procedures for conditions such as stroke and aneurysm rupture as well as operative precision.

The autoradiographic [<sup>14</sup>C]2-deoxyglucose technique was used to measure LCMRG in 5 experimental and 5 control animals. An analysis of variance was performed to test for significant regional differences. The following decreases in LCMRG expressed as a percentage change from control values were observed. The greatest decrease occurred in the globus pallidus (57.5%, P < 0.005) while the caudate nucleus only decreased to 82.6% (P < 0.05). This may correlate with proposed cholinergic extrapyramidal pathways. Ammon's horn of hippocampus decreased to 61.1% (P < 0.005) and the dentate gyrus to 71.8% (P < 0.005). These are proposed cholinergic limbic pathways from the septal nuclei. The marked effect on Ammon's horn may also relate to the specific impairment of recent memory induced by scopolamine. The auditory (67.3%), frontal (70.7%) and parietal cortex (70.1%) and the lateral thalamus (73.1%) were all significantly depressed (P < 0.005), which may be related to the proposed role of cholinergic pathways in the reticular activating system.

4549,"Contribution of the Atm protein to maintaining cellular homeostasis evidenced by continuous activation of the AP-1 pathway in Atm-deficient brains Maintenance of genome stability is essential for keeping cellular homeostasis. The DNA damage response is a central component in maintaining genome integrity. Among of the most cytotoxic DNA lesions are double strand breaks (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic chemicals. ATM is missing or inactivated in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia. Ataxia-telangiectasia patients display a pleiotropic phenotype and suffer primarily from progressive ataxia caused by degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje and granule neurons. Additional features are immunodeficiency, genomic instability, radiation sensitivity, and cancer predisposition. Disruption of the mouse Atm locus creates a murine model of ataxia-telangiectasia that exhibits most of the clinical features of the human disease but very mild neuronal abnormality. The ATM protein is a multifunctional protein kinase, which serves as a master regulator of cellular responses to DSBs. There is growing evidence that ATM may be involved in addition to the DSB response in other processes that maintain processes in cellular homeostasis. For example, mounting evidence points to increased oxidative stress in the absence of ATM. Here we report that the AP-1 pathway is constantly active in the brains of Atm-deficient mice not treated with DNA damaging agents. A canonical activation (increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and c-Jun) of the AP-1 pathway was found in Atm-deficient cerebra, whereas induction of the AP-1 pathway in Atm-deficient cerebella is likely to mediate elevated expression of c-Fos and c-Jun. Although Atm(+/+) mice are capable of responding to ionizing radiation by activating stress responses such as the AP-1 pathway, Atm-deficient mice display higher basal AP-1 activity but gradually lose their ability to activate AP-1 DNA-binding activity in response to ionizing radiation. Our results further demonstrate that inactivation of the ATM gene results in a state of constant stress.",Excluded,0.14496323

The overall response rate was 86% (n = 36). No increase in neurotoxicity was detected, and no patient experienced grade >= 4 toxicity, but three patients required dose reduction for grade 3 rash. At a median follow-up of 28.5 months (for living patients), median survival time was 11.8 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 19.1 months). Of 17 patients with known EGFR status, median survival time was 9.3 months for those with wild-type EGFR and 19.1 months for those with EGFR mutations. Conclusion Erlotinib was well tolerated in combination with WBRT, with a favorable objective response rate. The higher-than-expected rate of EGFR mutations in these unselected patients raises the possibility that EGFR-mutated tumors are prone to brain dissemination.

4552,"Pituitary metastasis from renal cell carcinoma: Description of a case report Objective: Rare disease Background: Pituitary metastasis is uncommon, breast and lung cancers being the most frequent primary tumors. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a rare cause of pituitary metastases, with only a few cases described to date. Case Report: We report a case of a 61-year-old man who presented with a progressive deterioration of visual acuity and field associated with a bitemporal hemianopsia. Two years ago, he underwent radical right nephrectomy for a clear cell RCC (ccRCC). The biological tests showed pan-hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus. Brain MRI revealed a large sellar tumor lesion bilaterally infiltrating the cavernous sinuses, which was surgically resected. Histology confirmed a ccRCC pituitary metastasis. The patient received post-surgical radiotherapy. Considering the presence of concomitant extra-pituitary metastases, treatment with sunitinib was started, followed by several lines of therapy with axitinib, everolimus, and sorafenib because of tumor progression. The patient also presented with a pituitary tumor recurrence, which was treated by stereotaxic radiotherapy. He died five years after the initial diagnosis of RCC and 30 months after the diagnosis of the pituitary metastasis. Conclusion(s): There are no standardized treatment guidelines for management of pituitary metastases. Pituitary surgery plays a role in symptom palliation, and it does not have any relevant impact on survival. Exclusive radiotherapy or stereotaxic radiotherapy could be an alternative to surgery in patients whose general condition is poor or who have concomitant extra-pituitary metastases.

Overall mean levels of breast and arm symptoms were low, but with large individual variations. At all six time points, the mean levels of breast symptoms were significantly higher than those of arm symptoms. Overall, the mean level of both types of symptoms decreased during follow-up. A body mass index (BMI) of 25 or greater and breast symptoms at eight months were associated with having breast symptoms at two years. Arm symptoms at baseline and at eight months, and radiation therapy and a BMI of 25 or greater were associated with having arm symptoms at two years.CONCLUSIONS: Breast symptoms show different patterns of change and are not associated with the same factors as arm symptoms.IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: For nurses monitoring women treated for breast cancer, the results of this study provide knowledge regarding the importance of early symptom identification and long-term symptoms after treatment.",Excluded,0.95084

In this study we compared these agents in terms of radiation doses and fluoroscopy times. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation exposure of patients treated with Onyx to the radation exposure of those treated with nBCA on a per embolization basis. Method(s): The study group consisted of 34 patients that were embolized at the Leiden University Medical Center. Patients were assigned to two groups, Group I consisting of patients that had received Onyx embolization and Group II consisting of patients that had received nBCA embolization. The patient groups were matched for age, AVM characteristics and the number of embolizations. Cohorts were compared by PA radiation dose and lateral radiation dose. Result(s): A total of 44 embolizations were performed on 34 patients (Onyx, 17 patients and 22 embolizations; nBCA, 17 patients and 22 embolizations).

We examined in detail the effects of delta-conotoxin PVIA from the fish hunting cone snail Conus purpurascens on sodium currents in dissociated sympathetic neurons from the leopard frog Rana pipiens. We also compared this toxin's effects with those of delta-conotoxin SVIE from Conus striatus, another piscivorous cone snail. d-PVIA slowed the time-course of inactivation of delta sodium currents and shifted the voltage-dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation to more hyperpolarized potentials. Similar, albeit more pronounced, effects were seen with d-SVIE. While the effects of d-PVIA were reversed by washing, those of d-SVIE were largely irreversible over the time-course of these experiments. The effects of d-PVIA could be suppressed by conditioning depolarizations in a voltage- and time-dependent manner, whereas the effects of d-SVIE were largely resistant to conditioning depolarizations.

This study was performed to quantify the additional radiation exposure (RE) and fluoroscopy time (FT) needed in patients treated for a tandem occlusion in the anterior circulation compared to patients without a preceding carotid artery occlusion or stenosis receiving EST. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained stroke database of a comprehensive stroke center focusing on the RE (as per dose area product in muGy*m2, median [IQR]), procedure and FT (in minutes, median [IQR]) in patients receiving carotid artery stenting (CAS) and MT in the anterior circulation ischemic stroke. Patients who received CAS and MT were matched with patients needing only MT according to number of thrombectomy maneuvers, location of intracranial occlusion, mode of anesthesia, gender and age (order of decreasing priority). Ergebnisse: Overall 236 patients (n = 118 in each group) have been included in this analysis. Additionally to matching criteria, there was no significant difference in patient's pre-morbid degree of disability (as per modified Rankin Scale), initial severity of stroke symptoms (as per National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale), and administration of i. v. rtPA or time from stroke onset to groin puncture in patients with known symptom onset. Procedure times (CAS+: 121 [80-176]; CAS-: 66 [45-106]), fluoroscopy times (CAS+: 57 [37-88]; CAS-: 3 2 [20-53]) as well as radiation exposure (CAS+: 19042 [13603-28722]; CAS-: 12379 [9307-18969]) were significantly higher in patients receiving CAS (all p-values: <0.0001). This is a relative median increase of radiation exposure of 53.8% and a relative increase of 78.2% of fluoroscopy time.

4562,"c-Abl is required for development and optimal cell proliferation in the context of p53 deficiency The c-Abl tyrosine kinase and the p53 tumor suppressor protein interact functionally and biochemically in cellular genotoxic stress response pathways and are implicated as downstream mediators of ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated). This fact led us to study genetic interactions in vivo between c-Abl and p53 by examining the phenotype of mice and cells deficient in both proteins. c-Abl-null mice show high neonatal mortality and decreased B lymphocytes, whereas p53-null mice are prone to tumor development. Surprisingly, mice doubly deficient in both c-Abl and p53 are not viable, suggesting that c-Abl and p53 together contribute to an essential function required for normal development. Fibroblasts lacking both c-Abl and p53 were similar to fibroblasts deficient in p53 alone, showing loss of the G(1)/S cell-cycle checkpoint and similar clonogenic survival after ionizing radiation. Fibroblasts deficient in both c-Abl and p53 show reduced growth in culture, as manifested by reduction in the rate of proliferation, saturation density, and colony formation, compared with fibroblasts lacking p53 alone. This defect could be restored by reconstitution of c-Abl expression. Taken together, these results indicate that the ATM phenotype cannot be explained solely by loss of c-Abl and p53 and that c-Abl contributes to enhanced proliferation of p53-deficient cells. Inhibition of c-Abl function may be a therapeutic strategy to target p53-deficient cells selectively.",Excluded,0.08662337
4563,"Saturation of DNA repair measured by alkaline elution To determine whether the half-times (T1/2) of the DNA repair processes measured by alkaline elution increased in a dose-dependent manner, exponentially growing 9L/Ro rat brain tumor cells were irradiated with doses of 15-50 Gy, and their DNA repair kinetics was measured by alkaline elution. At 15 Gy, the DNA repair kinetics was biphasic with the fast phase having a T1/2 approximately 6 min and the slow phase having a T1/2 approximately 42 min. As the dose was increased to 50 Gy, the fast-phase T1/2 remained at approximately 6 min, but the slow-phase T1/2 increased to approximately 87 min. Although a dose-dependent increase in the T1/2 of the slow phase of DNA repair (saturation) was measured by alkaline elution, both the absolute value of the slow-phase T1/2 and the dependency of the slow-phase T1/2 on dose were less than those measured by alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation in zonal rotors with slow reorienting gradient capability. Thus these two techniques appear either to depend on different hydrodynamic properties of the DNA or to have different coefficients of dependency for the same hydrodynamic properties of the DNA. The lower sensitivity for detection of the dose dependency of DNA repair makes it unlikely that the alkaline elution technique will be useful for quantitatively relating the shape of mammalian cell survival curves to the doses at which saturation of a DNA repair process occurs.",Excluded,0.60922784
4564,"Ribonuclear foci at the neuromuscular junction in myotonic dystrophy type 1 In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) the muscle fibers express RNA containing an expanded CUG repeat (CUG(exp)). The CUG(exp) RNA is retained in the nucleus, forming ribonuclear foci. Splicing factors in the muscleblind (MBNL) family are sequestered in ribonuclear foci, resulting in abnormal regulation of alternative splicing. In extrajunctional nuclei, these effects on splicing regulation lead to reduced chloride conductance and altered insulin receptor signaling. Here we show that CUG(exp) RNA is also expressed in subsynaptic nuclei of muscle fibers and in motor neurons in DM1, causing sequestration of MBNL1 protein in both locations. In a transgenic mouse model, expression of CUG(exp) RNA at high levels in extrajunctional nuclei replicates many features of DM1, but the toxic RNA is poorly expressed in subsynaptic nuclei and the mice fail to develop denervation-like features of DM1 myopathology.

Action plan for multicenter trials in: Stroke, traumatic brain injury, radiation encephalopathy and status migrainosus Introduction: There is great interest in using hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) to treat neurological disease. The exquisite sensitivity of neural tissue to hypoxia makes increased oxygenation attractive as a therapy for disease processes that induce ischemia, edema, and, more recently, apoptosis. Four things specifically exist as targets for future projects and clinical trials: (1) stroke (2) traumatic brain injury (3) radiation induced necrosis and (4) status migrainosus. Method(s): Specific aims: Stroke: determine if the use of HBO in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke is effective at improving outcomes. TBI: determine whether use of HBO in the acute state after traumatic brain injury is effective at improving outcomes and reducing elevated ICP. RIN: determine whether HBO treatment of radiation necrosis of brain results in improvement of neurological function and reduction of necrosis. Migraine: determine whether use of HBO will relieve headache pain in status migrainosus. Result(s): Stroke: there is evidence from animal studies that focal cerebral ischemia may improve after HBO treatment. TBI: the interest in using HBO to treat TBI is based upon the premise that hypoxia, edema and apoptosis play significant roles in the pathophysiology of the disease. RIN: the evidence suggests that in cases where either the patient is not improving on medical therapies or when surgical resection is not possible, HBO should be considered as a treatment option. Migraine: there is some evidence looking at HBO as an effective treatment of acute migraine attack.

Immobilization systems and their corresponding set-up errors influence the clinical target volume to planning target volume (CTV-PTV) margins and thus may result in undesirable treatment outcomes. This study compared the reproducibility of patient positioning with Hipfix system and whole body alpha cradle with respect to localized prostate cancer and investigated the existing CTV-PTV margins in the clinical oncology departments of two hospitals.METHODS: Forty sets of data of patients with localized T1-T3 prostate cancer were randomly selected from two regional hospitals, with 20 patients immobilized by a whole-body alpha cradle system and 20 by a thermoplastic Hipfix system. Seven sets of the anterior-posterior (AP), cranial-caudal (CC) and medial-lateral (ML) deviations were collected from each patient. The reproducibility of patient positioning within the two hospitals was compared using a total vector error (TVE) parameter. In addition, CTV-PTV margins were computed using van Herk's formula. The resulting values were compared to the current CTV-PTV margins in both hospitals.RESULTS: The TVE values were 5.1 and 2.8 mm for the Hipfix and the whole-body alpha cradle systems respectively. TVE associated with the whole-body alpha cradle system was found to be significantly less than the Hipfix system (p < 0.05). The CC axis in the Hipfix system attained the highest frequency of large (23.6%) and serious (7.9%) set-up errors. The calculated CTV to PTV margin was 8.3, 1.9 and 2.3 mm for the Hipfix system, and 2.1, 3.4 and 1.8 mm for the whole body alpha cradle in CC, ML and AP axes respectively. All but one (CC axis using Hipfix) margin calculated did not exceed the corresponding hospital protocol. The whole body alpha cradle system was found to be significantly better than the Hipfix system in terms of reproducibility (p < 0.05), especially in the CC axis.CONCLUSIONS: The whole body alpha cradle system was more reproducible than the Hipfix system. In particular, the difference in CC axis contributed most to the results and the current CC margin for the Hipfix system might be considered as inadequate.",Excluded,0.08672883

The normal canine spleen could handle live pneumococci injected into the splenic artery, as proven by sterile cultures of splenic vein samples. The size of the bolus used was determined by repeated trials and proved to be one billion pneumococci per pound of body weight. The capacity of the irradiated spleen to handle this number of pneumococci was impaired. It was found that whole body irradiation, nitrogen mustard, thio-tepa, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vinblastine, and azothioprine all impaired this capacity of the spleen. The dose of the chemotherapeutic agent was the same in milligrams per kilogram as that used in the cancer clinic. A method for determining the recovery time following the use of one or more agents was developed with the repeated use of the spleen model.

A nonsignificant difference between RF operators and controls was found in the prevalence of subjective symptoms, but the time integrated exposure parameters seem to be of importance to the prevalence of some subjective symptoms: fatigue, headaches, and warmth sensations in the hands. Further, RF operators had a significantly lower heart rate (24 h registration) and more episodes of bradycardia compared to controls.",Excluded,0.08952473

4579,"Concomitant chemotherapy and radiation for the treatment of advanced-stage endometrial cancer Introduction Ccombination chemotherapy and radiation therapy is used for adjuvant treatment of stage III-IV endometrial cancer. The goal of this study was to review the treatment duration, toxicity, and survival for patients treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiation. Methods Women with stage III-IV endometrial cancer treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation between 2006 and 2013 were included. Toxicities were classified per CTCAE v3.0 and RTOG/EORTC late radiation morbidity scoring. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify treatment and toxicities. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival. Results Fifty-one patients met our inclusion criteria. Median age was 60 (range 33-85). Thirty-six patients (70.6%) had endometrioid histology, 13 patients (25.5%) had serous, clear cell, or mixed histology, and 2 women (3.9%) had carcinosarcoma. Forty-eight patients had stage III disease and three patients were stage IVB. Mean treatment duration was 107 +/- 19 days. Forty-two patients received all planned chemotherapy, and 16 patients required a dose reduction. Thirty-four patients (66.7%) experienced grade 3-4 toxicities, the majority of which were hematologic. There were no deaths related to therapy. Eighty-six percent of patients received leukocyte growth factors, and 25% of patients received a blood transfusion. Seven late grade 3-4 complications occurred: four gastrointestinal and two genitourinary, and one patient had ongoing neuropathy. Median progression-free survival was 42.8 months (range 4.4-81.5 months) and median overall survival was 44.9 months (range 5.1-82.6 months). Three-year overall survival was 80%.

4580,"Sacral nerve stimulator use in a patient with low anterior resection syndrome Introduction: Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer are treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgical resection. Advanced surgical techniques such as mesorectal excision have enabled sphincter sparing surgery to be accomplished for patients with distal cancers. Although these procedures are being done more frequently, they remain fraught with both immediate perioperative and long term complications. Fecal Incontinence (FI) is a significant long term postoperative complication which can result following such surgical intervention. While reports show improvement over a 1-2 year period, a significant number of patients continue to experience FI and the so called Low Anterior Syndrome (LAS). Sacral nerve neuromodulation has been traditionally used for treatment of urinary incontinence with the use of Sacral Nerve Stimulator (SNS) implantation and is now being utilized to treat FI. We report the initial successful use of SNS to treat fecal incontinence secondary to radiation and postoperative changes following treatment for rectal cancer. A 70 year old Asian female was diagnosed with stage III rectal cancer and underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by low anterior resection with diverting ileostomy in 2011. Her ostomy was reversed in August 2012 and she developed fecal incontinence. Non-operative measures were taken in attempt to improve her incontinence without success including fiber supplementation and pelvic floor therapy. Method(s): Prior to SNS implantation the patient was given a Cleveland Clinic Fecal Incontinence Score (CCFIS). Patients rate daily incontinence episodes on a 4 point scale in 5 categories including incontinence to solids, liquids, gas, frequency of protective undergarment pads and need to modify lifestyle. A score of 0 in each category is equivalent to never events and a score of 4 is equal to always with 20 being a maximum score. The patient then underwent placement of the SNS probes into the S3 foramen. This was followed by a 1 week test period in which the patient had the probes connected to an external modulator. Following the test phase she then was reassessed with the CCFIS. Result(s): The patients initial CCFIS was the maximum score of 20. Following insertion of the probe at 1 week the patient reported an improvement in her CCFIS to 11. She maintained incontinence to solids usually (score of 3), liquid never (0), gas always (4), use of pads always (4), lifestyle modification never (0). Conclusion(s): Sacral Nerve Stimulator insertion is potentially an effective treatment for fecal incontinence for patients that have undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiation and resection for rectal cancer. Further study is warranted on larger sample sizes to ensure consistency of results and long term outcomes should be measured.",Excluded,0.086441584
4581,"Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions and Intracranial Pressure During CSF Infusion Testing BACKGROUND: A noninvasive method to monitor changes in intracranial pressure (ICP) is required for astronauts on long-duration spaceflight who are at risk of developing the Visual Impairment/Intracranial Pressure syndrome that has some, but not all of the features of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. We assessed the validity of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) to detect changes in ICP.METHODS: Subjects were eight patients undergoing medically necessary diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infusion testing for hydrocephalus. DPOAE measurements were obtained with an FDA-approved system at baseline and six controlled ICP levels in ~3 mmHg increments in random order, with a range from 10.8 +/- 2.9 mmHg (SD) at baseline to 32.3 +/- 4.1 mmHg (SD) at level 6.RESULTS: For f2 frequencies between 800 and 1700 Hz, when ICP was >= 12 mmHg above baseline ICP, DPOAE angles increased significantly and DPOAE magnitudes decreased significantly, but less robustly.DISCUSSION: Significant changes in DPOAE angle and magnitude are seen when ICP is >= 12 mmHg above a subject's supine baseline ICP during CSF infusion testing. These results suggest that the changes in DPOAE angle and magnitude seen with change in ICP are physiologically based, and suggest that it should be possible to detect pathological ICP elevation using DPOAE measurements. To use DPOAE for noninvasive estimation of ICP during spaceflight will require baseline measurements in the head-up, supine, and head-down positions to obtain baseline DPOAE values at different ICP ranges.

A single mydriatic treatment with atropine immediately preceding the three-day exposure was sufficient to permit the effect in pigmented rats. No mydriasis was required for albino rats.

If a purpose of photostasis - absorption of a constant number of photons by the retina, regardless of incident light levels - is to maintain rods at saturation during the light period, then in retinal regions where light intensity is low, rhodopsin concentration should be high, and vice versa. 2. Our ocular transmission photometric measurements revealed that the distribution of light intensity across the rat retina was not as simple as had been thought and, furthermore, that the local concentration of rhodopsin had a high negative correlation with the light intensity. 3.

In studies investigating methylation and the role of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, the effect of this treatment upon the methylation itself is not well understood. We aimed to investigate any differences in methylation before or after treatment. Method(s): Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer were identified. Tumour tissue from pretreatment biopsies and post treatment resections for the same patients was subjected to DNA extraction. This was also modelled in vitro by administering ionizing radiation (7-15 Gy) to a colorectal cancer cell line and extracting DNA 48 hour later. Methylation specific PCR was used to characterize the methylation status of CpG islands in the promoter regions of 8 genes associated with rectal cancer. PCR band size and intensity was measured to give a semiquantiative analysis of methylation intensity in the cell line experiment. Result(s): 17 patients underwent analysis. Methylation was seen less frequently in post treatment specimens for all 8 markers, however, this difference was significant for one marker (ADAMTS1, 10/17 methylated pre vs 0/17 post, P = 0.001) and approached significance for another (hMLH1, 6/17 vs 1/17, P = 0.08). In the cell line study, methylation band intensity was significantly reduced above a dose of 10 Gy for both ADAMTS1 (P = 0.05) and NEUROG1 (P < 0.05) markers. Conclusion(s): Ionizing radiation appears to affect rectal cancer DNA methylation in patients and in an in vitro model. Further studies into this phenomenon are indicated, however, investigators should consider this when studying DNA methylation in patients undergoing radiation therapy.",Excluded,0.8565216
4585,"Radiation-induced astrogliosis and blood-brain barrier damage can be abrogated using anti-TNF treatment PURPOSE: In this article, we investigate the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in the initiation of acute damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain tissue following radiotherapy (RT) for CNS tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Intravital microscopy and a closed cranial window technique were used to measure quantitatively BBB permeability to FITC-dextran 4.4-kDa molecules, leukocyte adhesion (Rhodamine-6G) and vessel diameters before and after 20-Gy cranial radiation with and without treatment with anti-TNF. Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify astrogliosis post-RT and immunofluorescence was used to visualize protein expression of TNF and ICAM-1 post-RT. Recombinant TNF (rTNF) was used to elucidate the role of TNF in leukocyte adhesion and vessel diameter.RESULTS: Mice treated with anti-TNF showed significantly lower permeability and leukocyte adhesion at 24 and 48 h post-RT vs. RT-only animals. We observed a significant decrease in arteriole diameters at 48 h post-RT that was inhibited in TNF-treated animals. We also saw a significant increase in activated astrocytes following RT that was significantly lower in the anti-TNF-treated group. In addition, immunofluorescence showed protein expression of TNF and ICAM-1 in the cerebral cortex that was inhibited with anti-TNF treatment. Finally, administration of rTNF induced a decrease in arteriole diameter and a significant increase in leukocyte adhesion in venules and arterioles.CONCLUSIONS: TNF plays a significant role in acute changes in BBB permeability, leukocyte adhesion, arteriole diameter, and astrocyte activation following cranial radiation. Treatment with anti-TNF protects the brain's microvascular network from the acute damage following RT.",Included,0.9842768
4586,"The effect of biological effective dose on time to symptom progression in metastatic renal cell carcinoma AIMS: Renal cell carcinoma is commonly thought to be a radioresistant malignancy. Retrospective studies report conflicting results on the effect of radiotherapy dose escalation on response and time to progression in symptomatic metastatic disease; studies using the linear quadratic model have used alpha/beta ratios that are inappropriate for slow growing tumours. We aim to describe our experience with palliative radiotherapy in this context, relating Biological Effective Dose to outcome.MATERIALS AND METHODS: From December 1995 to April 2001, 143 independent palliative radiotherapy treatments were delivered to 78 patients in a single institution. Retrospective data was obtained on the radiotherapy schedule used, symptom response and time to symptom progression. The biological effective dose (BED) was calculated using alpha/beta ratios of 3 and 7 Gy (BED3 and BED7). The Log-Rank test was used to assess any differences in time to progression, and the Cox Proportional Hazards analysis to determine prognostic factors of time to progression.RESULTS: Overall symptomatic response rate was 73%, with most responses being partial (67%). Forty-three (38%) patients had symptomatic progression after a median follow-up of 425 days. BED (BED3 or BED7) was not significantly different across response types (complete, partial or no response; P=0.90 and 0.88, respectively) and was not predictive for time to symptomatic progression (P=0.99 for BED3 and P=0.70 for BED7). Patients with bone metastases received less total dose (P=0.001), less BED (BED3, P=0.0013, and BED7, P=0.0005) and had a significantly longer time to progression than other sites of metastases (hazard ratio (HR) 0.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.7; P=0.004). Initial treatment with interferon-alpha alone in patients presenting with metastatic disease, before palliative radiotherapy, was also associated with a shorter time to symptom progression (HR 4.6; 95% CI 1.5-14.1; P=0.007). On removal of these criteria, brain metastases became a significant predictor of progression time, with an HR of 2.5 (95% CI 1.0-5.9; P=0.05), showing an increased risk of progression with brain metastases compared with metastases elsewhere. Time from primary diagnosis to development of metastatic disease was not predictive of time to symptom progression (P=0.29).CONCLUSION: Despite the widespread assumption that renal cell carcinoma is radioresistant, retrospective assessment showed high response rates to palliative radiotherapy. On the basis of our data, higher BED does not seem to be a predictor of response or of duration of response in the palliative treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Palliation of bone pain seems to be particularly durable compared with the palliation of symptoms at other sites of metastases. A trend for shorter duration of palliative effect of whole-brain radiotherapy was noted.",Excluded,0.7108449

In this study we investigated the effects of radiation in an age-matched series of 3xTg-AD mice. Mice were hemibrain-irradiated with 5 fractions of 2 Gy and sacrificed 8 weeks after the end of treatment. Abeta and tau were assessed using immunohistochemistry and quantified using image analysis with Definiens Tissue Studio.

Background: There has been a notable trend towards using a radial approach during cardiac angiography in recent years. Studies show that irrespective of dose, cranial irradiation increases the risk of developing meningiomas by up to 10-fold [1,2], hence head dose monitoring should be a priority for departments. Objective(s): This study sought to determine whether head dose to operators and scrub nurses was affected by the choice of arterial access route. Method(s): A prospective study was performed over a period of 8 months monitoring the head dose to in-room personnel during both diagnostic and interventional coronary angiography cases. Data were collected using electronic detectors worn on the left temple by staff. The correlation between head dose to operating physician and the scrub nurse for both femoral and radial access points was evaluated. Result(s): The head dose to scrub nurses was significantly higher during radial cases compared with femoral access.

Further investigation is warranted to determine possible reasons for the increase in dose in radial access cases.",Excluded,0.09556295
4589,"Measuring smoking-induced extrastriatal dopamine release: A [11C]FLB-457 pet study Background: Preclinical studies indicate that nicotine can induce dopamine (DA) release in striatal and cortical brain regions, contributing to the reinforcing and cognitive effects respectively. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies using the D2/3 radiotracer [11C] raclopride to indirectly measure DA release via receptor occupancy have confirmed that tobacco smoking releases DA in striatal regions in humans. However, due to the low density of DA receptors in the cortex it was not possible to measure extrastriatal DA release in humans until the recent development of high affinity D2/3 radiotracers. In this study we used the high affinity D2/3 radiotracer [11C]FLB-457 to index tobacco-induced extrastriatal DA release in smokers. Method(s): Ten nicotine-dependent daily cigarette smokers underwent two high affinity [11C]FLB-457 PET scans: after overnight abstinence and smoking reinstatement (biochemically verified by expired carbon monoxide and plasma nicotine levels). Craving, withdrawal, mood and cognitive performance were assessed under both smoking conditions. Voxel-wise parameter estimation of binding potential (BPND) was performed using the basis function implementation of SRTM with the tissue time activity curve of the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. Spatially normalized [11C]FLB-457 BPND maps were statistically investigated to assess significant changes between the two conditions at every voxel using paired-tests (SPM 8). Results from the whole-brain voxel-wise paired t-test (abstinence 4 smoking) were masked with a map of a-priori regions of interest and subjected to an uncorrected threshold of p<0.05, with a minimum 30-voxel cluster extent. Result(s): There was a reduction [11C]FLB-457 BPND following smoking (an indirect measure of DA release) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; 323 voxels, peak t=3.38, p=0.004), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex/ anterior cingulate cortex (dmPFC / ACC; 1496 voxels, peak t=5.32, p<0.001), both of which survived a more stringent threshold of p<0.01, and the left insula (47 voxels, peak t=2.54 p=0.016). Exploratory analysis focused on limbic regions identified an effect in the bilateral amygdala (Left: 102 voxels, peak t=3.28, p=0.005; Right: 108 voxels, peak t =3.03, p=0.007). Extraction of values from these clusters revealed % changes in BPND in smoking versus abstinence conditions of -12.0% (SD=9.4) in the dlPFC, -11.5% (SD=12.8) in the dmPFC/ACC, -7.1% (SD=7.9) in the left insula and -13.1% in the bilateral amygdala. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of smoking-induced DA release in cortical regions such as the dlPFC, dmPFC and ACC. There was also some evidence for DA release in the insula and amygdala. The dmPFC, ACC, insula and amygdala are regions consistently associated with tobacco cue-presentaton, subjective craving and relapse susceptibility in fMRI studies, while the dlPFC appears to exert top-down control on tobacco craving and is involved in tobacco's pro-cognitive effects. As such [11C]FLB- 457 may be a useful tool to investigate individual differences in tobacco addiction severity and treatment response.",Excluded,0.08600901
4590,"Developing optic radiation tractography to reduce visual field deficits following anterior temporal lobe resection Objectives: Anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR) is an effective treatment for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. Damage to Meyer's loop of the optic radiation (OR) leads to postop visual field deficits (VFD) in 52-100% of patients and may prevent driving. The OR cannot be seen on clinical MRI sequences, but can be visualised using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. Incorporating these data into the neuronavigational system during surgery should reduce the risk of VFD. However, preop tractography is no longer valid due to brain shift/distortion. A new image registration technique to compensate for brain shift/distortion is described and validated it in a cohort of patients undergoing ATLR with the aim of using this to guide future neurosurgery. Method(s): Pre-/postop structural MRI and DTI scans were acquired on 16 patients undergoing ATLR. The OR was delinetaed using probabilistic tractography on preop data and propagated onto postop structural images using a novel image registration technique. Degree of resection was quantified by the maximum A-P distance between the anterior of the OR on the propagated tractography and the resection margin. Postop VFD was quantified as percentage of upper quadrant lost using Goldmann perimetry. Result(s): Postop VFD were seen in 8 patients (10-92% of the upper quadrant, mean 51%). In 8 patients without VFD, the propagated OR was 0.0-15.0 (mean 3.4 mm) posterior to the resection margin. In 8 patients with VFD, the propagated OR lay 3.8-15.9 (mean 7.7 mm) anterior to the resection margin. The Pearson correlation coefficient between A-P distance and VFD was 0.809 (one-tailed p = 0.008). Linear regression showed for each additional 1 mm of resection, 5.8% more upper quadrant vision was lost. Mean image registration time by implementation on a GPU (graphical processing unit) was 3.2 min. Conclusion(s): A novel non-linear registration algorithm was used to propagate preop OR tractography onto postop images. Results obtained were highly predictive of the VFD. MRI and DTI scans can be acquired during surgery in an interventional MRI suite. As transfer of the patient from the MRI scanner back to the operating table takes 7-10 min, the algorithm is fast enough to be applied to propagate preop tractography onto intraop images before surgery recommences. Future work will display the propagated tractography to the surgeon in the neuronavigation system to determine whether this additional information can reduce the risk of a VFD.",Excluded,0.0864272
4591,"Tractography to visualise the relationship of the optic radiation to epileptogenic lesions prior to neurosurgery Background A third of patients with epilepsy are refractory to medical treatment and may be amenable to surgery. A major concern is to avoid causing new deficits. As conventional MR imaging does not delineate the optic radiation, the risk to vision from surgery cannot be predicted, nor can surgery be tailored to minimise the risk. Methods Conventional structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging were acquired in 13 patients with medically refractory epilepsy due a lesion near the optic radiation and undergoing pre-surgical evaluation at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. The optic radiation was delineated and visualised in relation to the lesions on anatomical images and in 3D reconstructions. Pre- and post-operative visual fields were acquired by Goldmann perimetry. Results The relationship between the epileptogenic lesion and the optic radiation was demonstrated in each patient provididing helpful additional information in deciding whether to proceed with surgery, and in planning the surgical procedure and approach. Prseoperative and postoperative imaging findings correlated with the visual field data. Conclusion The optic radiation shows significant anatomical variability, but can be reliably delineated by tractography. As surgical disruption of the optic radiation has serious consequences for the patient, DTI tractography proves a useful technique in this population. Future integration with real-time neuronavigation will inimise the risks of neurosurgery.",Excluded,0.085806645
4592,"Molecular and behavioral changes in nociception in a novel rat model of chronic pancreatitis for the study of pain The approach to the management of painful chronic pancreatitis has been empirical, primarily due to the lack of information about biological mechanisms producing pain. To facilitate research into pain mechanisms, our aim was to assess a rat model of chronic pancreatitis induced by pancreatic infusion of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid as a model of painful pancreatitis. Nociception was assessed by measuring mechanical sensitivity of the abdomen and by recording the number of nocifensive behaviors in response to electrical stimulation of the pancreas. Expression of neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) in the thoracic dorsal root ganglia receiving input from the pancreas and nerve growth factor (NGF) in the pancreas were measured. Rats with pancreatitis exhibited marked increase in sensitivity to mechanical probing of the abdomen and increased sensitivity to noxious electrical stimulation of the pancreas. There were significant increases in NGF protein in the pancreas and in expression of neuropeptides CGRP and SP in the sensory neurons from dorsal root ganglia receiving input from the pancreas. We have established quantitative measures of referred nociception and pancreatic hyperalgesia in a rat model of chronic pancreatitis that bears histological similarities to the human disease.

4593,"Effect of gonadotropin secretion rate on the radiosensitivity of the rat luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone neuron and gonadotroph To test the hypothesis that the functional state of hypothalamic LHRH neurons and pituitary gonadotrophs might alter their radiosensitivity, we determined the experimental conditions under which the gonadotropin response to castration could be impaired by a single dose of cranial irradiation. Single doses of cranial irradiation greater than 2000 rads were lethal to unshielded rats. Shielding of the oropharynx and esophagus allowed the animals to survive doses up to 5000 rads. Doses between 2000 and 5000 rads had no effect on basal gonadotropin levels for as long as 3 months after irradiation. Irradiation caused a dose- and time-dependent impairment, however, in the gonadotropin response to castration. Impairment of the gonadotropin levels of castrate animals occurred in animals that were irradiated either before or after castration. However, rats irradiated in the castrate state showed a decreased susceptibility to irradiation damage. Additionally, stimulation of the pituitary by LHRH agonist (LHRHa) 3 h before irradiation significantly reduced the impairment of gonadotropin secretion 12-20 weeks after irradiation (P less than 0.05). Thus, increased functional activity of the rat hypothalamus or pituitary at the time of irradiation, induced by either castration or acute LHRHa administration, was associated with some protection against the gonadotropin-lowering effect of irradiation. Based upon these data, we hypothesize that stimulation of gonadotropin secretion at the time of therapeutic cranial irradiation in humans might protect against subsequent impairment of gonadotropin secretion.",Included,0.9841649

Method(s): Eight domestic pigs were operated with antegrade transapical delivery of a single-sidebranch arch endograft including a mating stentgraft to the innominate artery. Technical feasibility, operating time, radiation parameters and hemodynamic changes were studied according to standardized protocol during baseline (T0), after establishing of the transapical access and through-and-through wire (T1) and after stent-graft deployment (T2). Myocardial and cerebral perfusion were assessed by fluorescent-microspheres (FM) and transit-time-flow measurement (TTFM). Result(s): Transapical access, introduction and deployment of the endograft, sidebranch catheterization and deployment of the mating stent-graft were feasible in 6 of the 8 animals with unimpeded perfusion of the innominate artery. One animal was lost during transapical access, one during sire-branch catheterization. The mean operating and fluoroscopy times were 157+/-47min and 15.9+/-3.2min. During introduction and deployment of the stent-graft transient aortic valve insufficiency occurred in all animals. Hemodynamic stability recovered within ten minutes after retrieval of the delivery system in all animals. The innominate artery was patent with unchanged TTFM-flow measurements throughout the procedure. FM evaluation revealed stable myocardial and cerebral perfusion. Conclusion(s): Antegrade transapical access to the aortic arch for implantation of a single sidebranch arch endograft is feasible in a porcine model with reversible impact on hemodynamic measures during deployment. Transapical access allows for deployment of a complex endograft through a single large bore access-site in a porcine model.

4597,"Gain of rod to horizontal cell synaptic transfer: relation to glutamate release and a dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium current We related rod to horizontal cell synaptic transfer to glutamate release by rods. Simultaneous intracellular records were obtained from dark-adapted rod-horizontal cell pairs. Steady-state synaptic gain (defined as the ratio of horizontal cell voltage to rod voltage evoked by the same light stimulus) was 3.35 +/- 0.60 for dim flashes and 1.50 +/- 0.03 for bright flashes. Under conditions of maintained illumination, there was a measurable increment of horizontal cell hyperpolarization for each light-induced increment of rod hyperpolarization over the full range of rod voltages. In separate experiments we studied glutamate release from an intact, light-responsive photoreceptor layer, from which inner retinal layers were removed. Steady light reduced glutamate release as a monotonic function of intensity; spectral sensitivity measures indicated that we monitored glutamate release from rods. The dependence of glutamate release on rod voltage was well fit by the activation function for a high-voltage-activated, dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type calcium current, suggesting a linear dependence of glutamate release on [Ca]i in the synaptic terminal.

Cauda equina lesion as a late radiation sequela] PURPOSE: Course and pathophysiology of a typical syndrome after irradiation of the cauda equina were studied.PATIENTS AND MATERIALS: 7 patients with irradiation damage of the cauda equina were examined clinically and neurophysiologically.RESULTS: After a mean delay of 5 years and 6 months all patients developed an ascending lower motor neuron weakness of the legs without pain, in part accompanied with mild sensory and sphincter symptoms. Electromyography, evoked potentials and neurography were important for the differential diagnosis to tumor infiltration. The course was progredient.DISCUSSION: For a long time, the underlaying damage was thought to be in the anterior horn cell body. The course of the studied patients with additional sensory and vegetative symptoms implies for a direct bilateral damage of the cauda equina.

We report on a patient with delayed cyst formation after combined embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery treatments for a cerebral AVM.

4602,"Amide proton transfer MRI of malignant gliomas for detecting active versus inactive tumor Although promising therapies are being advanced for patients with malignant gliomas, a major limitation in developing these therapies is the lack of specificity of neuro-imaging, particularly in distinguishing between tumor progression and treatment-induced injury. Amide proton transfer (APT) MRI is a protein-based molecular imaging technique that uses the water signal to detect amide protons of endogenous mobile proteins in tissue. Our prior data suggest that high APT is a typical feature of active tumor. We hypothesized here that patients with lt; 2% APT intensity after chemoradiation would have a longer progression free survival compared to patients with high APT. METHOD(S): Patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma underwent standard and APTMRimaging at 3T one month after completion of chemoradiation. Patients were followed for time to progression (defined as either pathologically confirmed active tumor post-treatment or a change in therapy based on clinical assessment of progression) as well as overall survival. RESULT(S): Nineteen subjects, 14 male, were enrolled. Eleven had glioblastoma and 8 anaplastic astrocytoma. Twelve subjects had high APT intensity (63.1%) and 7 had low/normal APT intensity. Dose of steroids at time of imaging, time from initial imaging, and dose of radiation treatment was similar between groups. All but one patient received temozolomide with radiation. Median time to progression was 122 days (range 19-488) in the high APT group and 472 days (range 47-698) in the low APT group. Median overall survival was 343 days (range 155-649) in the high APT group and 662 days (495-794) in the low APT group. CONCLUSION(S): APT imaging may allow early detection of treatment response or active tumor in patients with malignant glioma after chemoradiation.",Excluded,0.1777658
4603,"Flow cytometric analysis of rat striatal nerve terminals Methods were developed for the analysis and isolation of striatal nerve terminals (synaptosomes) using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Comparison of the light-scattering properties of synaptosomal and mitochondrial fractions indicated that particles in the synaptosomal fraction were generally larger and more sensitive to hypotonic lysis, consistent with results obtained by other methods of analysis. FACS analysis using indirect immunofluorescence techniques indicated that approximately 84% of the synaptosomal fraction was labeled by monoclonal antibody (mAb) A2B5 and thus appeared to be of neuronal origin. After permeabilization, between 5 and 10% of the particles were labeled by a mAb to glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggesting that they were derived from astrocytes. A fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) was used to distinguish intact synaptosomes from free mitochondria (only the former maintain a membrane potential under the present experimental conditions). Approximately 83% of the synaptosomal fraction exhibited increased fluorescence after incubation with the VSD; furthermore, the fluorescence signal decreased in response to depolarizing agents (elevated potassium and veratridine). A portion of the mitochondrial fraction responded similarly, consistent with the presence of contaminating synaptosomes. Analysis of synaptosomal labeling by 11 fluorescein-conjugated plant lectins indicated that striatal nerve terminals differ significantly in their cell surface glycoconjugates. Subpopulations of synaptosomes defined on the basis of lectin binding were collected by FACS onto filters and probed with a mAb to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) using Western blot techniques. While subpopulations exhibited different amounts of TH immunoreactivity, none of the lectins appeared to recognize TH-positive (i.e., dopaminergic) synaptosomes exclusively. These findings demonstrate that synaptosomes can be characterized and isolated for further study based on FACS analysis of properties such as size, membrane potential, and the presence of intracellular or cell surface molecules.",Excluded,0.08604571

4605,"Gamma knife radiosurgery after stereotactic aspiration for large cystic brain metastases Objective : Several treatment options have proven effective for metastatic brain tumors, including surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery. Tumors with cystic components, however, are difficult to treat using a single method. We retrospectively assessed the outcome and efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for cystic brain metastases after stereotactic aspiration of cystic components to decrease the tumor volume. Methods : The study population consisted of 24 patients (13 males, 11 females; mean age, 58.3 years) with cystic metastatic brain tumors treated from January 2002 to August 2008. Non-small cell lung cancer was the most common primary origin. After Leksell stereotactic frame was positioned on each patient, magnetic resonance images (MRI)-guided stereotactic cyst aspiration and GKRS were performed (mean prescription dose : 20.2 Gy). After treatment, patients were evaluated by MRI every 3 or 4 months. Results : After treatment, 13 patients (54.2%) demonstrated tumor control, 5 patients (20.8%) showed local tumor progression, and 6 patients (25.0%) showed remote progression. Mean follow-up duration was 13.1 months. During this period, 10 patients (41.7%) died, but only 1 patient (4.2%) died from brain metastases. The overall median survival after these procedures was 17.8 months. Conclusion : These results support the usefulness of GKRS after stereotactic cyst aspiration in patients with large cystic brain metastases. This method is especially effective for the patients whose general condition is very poor for general anesthesia and those with metastatic brain tumors located in eloquent areas.

4607,"Impact of age and comorbidity on treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) recurrence (AFT-03) Background: Older adults with NSCLC with no comorbidities are at risk of under treatment after initial diagnosis while those with severe comorbidities are at risk of over treatment. However, national data on how age and comorbidity impact treatment of recurrent NSCLC are limited. Method(s): Through a special study mechanism of the National Cancer Database, we randomly selected 9668 patients with surgically resected stage I-III NSCLC in 2006-07 from 1147 cancer facilities. Registrars reabstracted detailed preoperative comorbidity, recurrence, and treatment information to supplement existing data. Patients were stratified by recurrence status and predictors of active treatment vs supportive care only were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. Result(s): Median age at diagnosis was 67 (IQR 60-74). The most common comorbidities were COPD (40%) and CAD (21%). After 5-year median follow up, 62% had no recurrence, 11% had locoregional, and 27% had distant recurrence. Among those with locoregional recurrence, 79% received treatment (28% chemo, 25% chemo/radiation, 16% radiation, 10% surgery); 21% received supportive care only. Older patients (adjusted OR 0.73 per decade, p = .0008) and those with substance abuse (aOR 0.41, p = .008) were less likely to receive treatment. Women and patients with symptomatic or ipsilateral lung recurrence (vs lymph node) were also less likely to receive treatment (all p < .02). Among those with distant recurrence, 77% received treatment (30% radiation, 23% chemo, 13% chemo/radiation, 11% surgery); 23% received supportive care only. Older patients were less likely to receive treatment (aOR 0.75, p = .0001) while those without any comorbidities were more likely to receive treatment (aOR 1.65, p = .018). Metastatic site also predicted treatment: contralateral lung or liver metastases decreased the odds of treatment while brain or bone metastases increased the odds (all p < .05). Conclusion(s): Older patients, independent of comorbidity, were less likely to receive treatment for both locoregional and distant NSCLC recurrence. In contrast, the impact of comorbidity was stronger for distant recurrence, highlighting the importance of avoiding over treatment in the palliative setting.",Excluded,0.84979355
4608,"A pilot study using dynamic contrast enhanced-MRI as a response biomarker of the radioprotective effect of memantine in patients receiving whole brain radiotherapy PURPOSE: This pilot prospective study sought to determine whether dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) could be used as a clinical imaging biomarker of tissue toxicity from whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT).METHOD: 14 patients who received WBRT were imaged using dynamic contrast enhanced DCE-MRI prior to and at 8-weeks, 16-weeks and 24-weeks after the initiation of WBRT. Twelve of the patients were also enrolled in the RTOG 0614 trial, which randomized patients to the use of placebo or memantine. After the unblinding of the treatments received by RTOG 0614 patients, DCE-MRI measures of tumor tissue and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) vascular permeability (Initial Area Under the Curve (AUC) Blood Adjusted) was analyzed. Cognitive, quality-of-life (QOL) assessment and blood samples were collected according to the patient's ability to tolerate the exams. Circulating endothelial cells (CEC) were measured using flow cytometry.RESULTS: Following WBRT, there was an increasing trend in the vascular permeability of tumors (p=0.09) and NAWM (p=0.06) with time. Memantine significantly (p=0.01) reduced NAWM AUC changes following radiotherapy. Patients on memantine retained (COWA p= 0.03) better cognitive functions than those on placebo. No association was observed between the level of CEC and DCE-MRI changes, time from radiotherapy or memantine use.CONCLUSIONS: DCE-MRI can detect vascular damage secondary to WBRT.

Autopsy findings in 15 of these patients are reported. Ten patients received pituitary radiation (average dose, 116 Gy in six fractions) for progressive neovascularization retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus. Evidence of a time-dependent course of progressive fibrosis in their pituitary glands was found. Five patients were treated for eosinophilic adenomas. Although they had lower average doses of radiation (56 Gy in six fractions), their pituitary glands showed cystic cavitation of the adenomas. The adenomas thus appeared more radiosensitive than the normal pars anterior, which, in turn, was more radiosensitive than the adjacent neurohypophysis. No significant radiation changes were found in the surrounding brain or cranial nerves. The endocrine organs under pituitary control showed varying degrees of atrophy, and clinical tests revealed progressive hypofunction. It was concluded that charged-particle therapy produced a sharply delineated focal radiation lesion confined to the pituitary gland but did not cause injury to the critical structures of the surrounding central nervous system.",Excluded,0.92360485

Our results show that these IR knock-down rods have an accelerated decay of the light response and a small decrease in sensitivity by comparison to littermate WT rods. Our results indicate that the insulin receptor may have some role in controlling the rate of rod response decay, but they exclude a major role of the insulin receptor pathway in phototransduction.",Excluded,0.086045206
4612,"Acoustic neuromas: Evaluation of outcomes and toxicity with the use of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy Purpose/Objective: A number of different therapeutic strategies are commonly used to treat acoustic neuromas including gamma knife radiosurgery, linear accelerator based radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. Our centre treats patients with a fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy regime of 52.5 Gray in 25 fractions. Outcomes and toxicities of patients treated with this regime from 1995 to 2010 are presented here. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective review of all the available electronic case notes, as well as imaging reports for patients treated for acoustic neuroma, were conducted. RECIST criteria were used to assess response on imaging and treatment outcomes, and were analysed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Toxicity assessments were also conducted. Radiotherapy methods include immobilisation in a non-invasive relocatable Gill-Thomas-Cosman head frame with stereotactic head ring. A depth helmet was also used to ensure and verify reproducibility and a maximum tolerance of 2 mm was permitted. For tumour localisation and organs at risk (OAR) delineation a planning CT scan of the head was performed with the stereotactic head ring in place using 2 mm slices. CT images were transferred to the X knife radiotherapy planning computer system via the DICOM network for automatic external contouring, clinician contouring of target volume and OAR, followed by dose planning. After 2001 diagnostic 2mm stealth MRI scans were co-registered with the planning CT scan to allow more accurate delineation of target volume and OAR. Most patients were treated with an average of 3 non-coplanar arcs, with each arc having an equal collimator size which tended to be about 3 cm. This therefore produced a spherical shaped dose distribution. The choice of collimator size and arrangement of arcs depended on the size of tumour and location in relationship to the OAR, in particular the brainstem. A single iso-centre was chosen and the radiation dose was usually prescribed to 100% at the iso-centre using 6 MV photons. Result(s): 93 patients were identified of which 83 patients were available for follow-up with a median period of 5.7 years. Overall control rate using RECIST criteria was 92% (Fig 1). Toxicity data were available for 90 patients with 6 (7%) experiencing a reduction in hearing, 1 (1%) had a deterioration in their trigeminal nerve function and 1 (1%) had a deterioration in facial nerve function (Table 1). 4 (4%) patients developed hydrocephalus, requiring the placement of a shunt and 1 (1%) patient developed radiation brainstem necrosis. After further evaluation this patient was deemed to have been treated within acceptable dose constraints. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): This data suggests that a good control rate of acoustic neuromas is achievable using fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy to a dose of 52.5 Gray in 25 fractions.

4613,"Metabolic therapy reduces expression of PECAM-1/CD31 and decreases peritumoral edema in a mouse model of malignant glioma Patients with malignant brain tumors have a median survival of approximately one year following diagnosis, regardless of currently available treatments which include surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Improvement in the survival of brain cancer patients requires the design of new therapeutic modalities that take advantage of common phenotypes. One such phenotype is the metabolic dysregulation that is a hallmark of cancer cells. It has therefore been postulated that one approach to treating brain tumors may be by metabolic alteration such as that which occurs through the use of the ketogenic diet (KD). The KD is high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that induces ketosis and has been utilized for the non-pharmacologic treatment of refractory epilepsy. We and others have shown that this diet enhances survival and potentiates standard therapy in mouse models of malignant gliomas, yet the anti-tumor mechanisms are not fully understood. It has been previously shown that caloric restriction, which induces ketosis, reduces microvessel density in mouse and human brain tumor models, suggesting an anti-angiogenic effect. We now report that in animals fed KetoCal (KC) (4:1 fat:protein/carbohydrates) ad libitum, peritumoral edema is significantly reduced early in tumor progression when compared to those fed a standard rodent diet (SD). Western blot analysis showed a reduction of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1/CD31) in tumors from animals maintained on KC. These results were supported by immunohistochemical staining for CD31 which also revealed abnormal vessel structure in the tumors from animals fed SD but not in those fed KC, suggesting a normalizing effect by the KC. Furthermore gene expression profiling demonstrated that KC decreases expression of a group of genes involved in angiogenesis and vessel structuring including the genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB) and angiopoetin 1 receptor (TEK), integrin beta 1 (ITGB1), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases 1 (TIMP1). Taken together our data suggests that KC alters the angiogenic processes involved in malignant progression of gliomas. A greater understanding of the effects of the ketogenic diet as an adjuvant therapy will allow for a more rational approach to its clinical use.",Excluded,0.085950434
4614,"Analyzing the response to metabolic therapy in a mouse model of malignant glioma using multimodality imaging The ketogenic diet (KD) is a therapeutic high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that alters metabolism by increasing the level of ketone bodies in the blood. We have used a bioluminescent intracranial mouse model of malignant glioma and the IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, a PerkinElmer Co, Hopkinton, MA) to demonstrate that a rodent ketogenic diet given ad libitum increases blood ketones without altering animal weight or overall blood glucose levels. Animals maintained on a KD have extended survival following tumor implantation, and the KD potentiates the therapeutic effects of radiation and chemotherapy. We previously demonstrated in vivo that these tumors cause a local increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), but the KD reduced ROS in the tumor when quantitatively analyzed ex vivo. We now hypothesize that ketosis, which is known to have a neuroprotective effect in various diseases, may also reduce peritumoral edema and/or inflammation. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is a known mediator of inflammation, and expression profiling analysis showed that animals maintained on a SD have a significant increase in expression of the gene encoding COX-2 in their tumor, while animals maintained on KD showed no such increase. MRI analyses using a Bruker Biospec 70/30 MRI (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Freemont, CA) showed that animals fed KD also have a significant reduction in peritumoral edema. We previously demonstrated that commercially available fluorescent probes such as AngioSense 680 EX (PerkinElmer, Inc.) can be used in concert with in vivo imaging of tumor bioluminescence to demonstrate vascular permeability that can lead to increased peritumoral edema. We are now using the XenoLight RediJect COX-2 fluorescent probe (PerkinElmer, Inc) and the AngioSense 680 EX fluorescent probe in combination with the bioluminescent indication of tumor size and MRI analyses of tumor size and peritumoral edema. Co-registration of these images will be done using a mouse imaging shuttle and multi-modality software module (Caliper Life Sciences), thus facilitating in vivo analysis of the mechanisms of action of the KD on tumor gene expression and growth.",Excluded,0.08606347
4615,"Processing of modulated sounds in the zebra finch auditory midbrain: responses to noise, frequency sweeps, and sinusoidal amplitude modulations The avian auditory midbrain nucleus, the mesencephalicus lateralis, dorsalis (MLd), is the first auditory processing stage in which multiple parallel inputs converge, and it provides the input to the auditory thalamus. We studied the responses of single MLd neurons to four types of modulated sounds: 1) white noise; 2) band-limited noise; 3) frequency modulated (FM) sweeps, and 4) sinusoidally amplitude-modulated tones (SAM) in adult male zebra finches. Responses were compared with the responses of the same neurons to pure tones in terms of temporal response patterns, thresholds, characteristic frequencies, frequency tuning bandwidths, tuning sharpness, and spike rate/intensity relationships. Most neurons responded well to noise. More than one-half of the neurons responded selectively to particular portions of the noise, suggesting that, unlike forebrain neurons, many MLd neurons can encode specific acoustic components of highly modulated sounds such as noise. Selectivity for FM sweep direction was found in only 13% of cells that responded to sweeps. Those cells also showed asymmetric tuning curves, suggesting that asymmetric inhibition plays a role in FM directional selectivity. Responses to SAM showed that MLd neurons code temporal modulation rates using both spike rate and synchronization. Nearly all cells showed low-pass or band-pass filtering properties for SAM. Best modulation frequencies matched the temporal modulations in zebra finch song. Results suggest that auditory midbrain neurons are well suited for encoding a wide range of complex sounds with a high degree of temporal accuracy rather than selectively responding to only some sounds.",Excluded,0.08588012
4616,"Spinal ependymoma in adults: Diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy Introduction: Due to a relative low incidence of spinal ependymomas in adults, a definitive therapeutic strategy is still missing. Therefore, different concepts are under discussion without a uniform standard of therapy and diagnostics. Material(s) and Method(s): We evaluated all spinal ependymomas treated surgically from 03/2006 until 05/2012 at our department. This consecutive, retrospective series includes 41 patients: 23 female, 18 male, median age 51 y. (range 21-80). 22 Ependymomas were located intramedullary, 18 within cauda equina or filum terminale, 1 patient presented with multifocal spinal lesions including both, intramedullar and extramedullar lesions. Perioperative standard diagnostic of most tumors included a holospinal MRI and a CSF cytology. First follow-up MRI and exam was done 3 months postoperatively, further controls every year in case of stable findings. Current median follow-up is 29 months (range 3-72). Preoperative, early postoperative and follow-up clinical performance was evaluated according to the modified McCormick scale. Postoperative deterioration was dichotomized in ""slight"" (=deterioration without any increase of the modified McCormick scale grades or an increase in only one grade within the scale range 1-2) and ""significant"" (=increase to grade 7ge;3 on the modified McCormick scale). Result(s): Preoperatively, the vast majority presented neurologically intact or with mild deficits maintaining functional independence according to the modified McCormick scale. The most common preoperative symptom was pain (78%), followed by sensory deficits (54%), gait ataxia (34%), motor deficits (27%), and bowel/bladder dysfunction (12%). In only one patient the ependymoma was found incidentally. Gross total resection (GTR) could be achieved in 85% (n=35) (subtotal resection n=5, debulking of the main tumor mass of a multifocal disease n=1). Histology: the majority were WHO IIdegree (n=30), 10 WHOdegreeI tumours, 1 case of anaplastic ependymoma WHOdegreeIII. Immediately after surgery 24% (n=10) showed worsening of neurological symptoms, but in most cases only mild new deficits occurred. During follow up 78% (n=32) showed at least preop status, 37% (n=15) improved. In only 5% (n=2) a permanent significant deterioration remained. Adjuvant radiotherapy was performed after the first surgery in two cases: in one patient with drop metastasis after the GTR of the main tumour, and in another patient with multifocal lesions after debulking, both were WHOdegreeII ependymomas. Tumour recurrence was seen in 4 cases, so far: 3 WHOdegreeII, 1 WHOdegreeI, 2 of them despite previous GTR and 1 despite adjuvant radiation. Median progression free survival was 22 months (range 6-43). 2 patients died of meningeosis 19 and 31 months after the initial diagnosis, respectively. Conclusion(s): Gross-total resection still stays the main column of ependymoma therapy. In our series this could be achieved in 85% accompanied by a rate of 5% for significant persistent deficits. In cases of incomplete resection stereotactic radiotherapy as well as a wait and see srategy can be considered. In case of disseminated disease holospinal radiation with a boost to the primary tumour site is recommended.

Vibratome sections of perfusion-fixed rat brain were incubated: (a) overnight at room temperature (20-22 degrees C), (b) during various periods of time under microwave irradiation, such that the induced temperatures did not exceed 10 degrees C, (c) same as (b) but with induced temperatures not exceeding 40 degrees C, (d) without microwave irradiation, at 4-10 degrees C (temperature control for (b)), (e) same as (d) but at 40 degrees C (temperature control for (c)). During the incubation-irradiation we continuously monitored the temperature and controlled it by cooling and by manipulating the energy output of the magnetron. The peroxidase immunocytochemical procedure was completed using for all sections the same incubation parameters. Selected GABA-immunoreacted sections were examined in the electron microscope. Incubation at 10 degrees C in the primary antiserum as short as 30 min, with or without microwave irradiation, already results in (weak) binding of the antibodies to immunoreactive structures. One or 2 h of incubation in the primary antiserum in the microwave oven at 40 degrees C or at the same temperature outside the microwave oven results in excellent staining of GABA-immunoreactive structures and of good staining of enkephalin- or vasopressin-immunoreactive structures. The ultrastructural details were much better preserved in incubated-irradiated sections than in sections incubated overnight and only slightly less preserved than in the other control sections. There is no improved penetration of the antibodies into the sections.

4618,"Bridging Radiation Therapy Before Commercial Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy for Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma Purpose: CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy has emerged as a promising treatment for relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma (r/rABL), culminating in 2 US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies: tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) and axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel). Following leukapheresis and in preparation for CART infusion, contemporary bridging and lymphodepletion regimens rely mostly on cytotoxic chemotherapy. Here, in a cohort of patients treated with commercial tisa-cel and axi-cel, we show that bridging-RT may offer a supplemental approach. Methods and Materials: Thirty-one patients receiving commercial tisa-cel (n = 13) or axi-cel (n = 18) between August 2018 and February 2019 for r/rABL were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: (1) bridging-RT within 30 days of CART infusion or (2) nonbridging-RT (NBRT), in which patients received either remote RT greater than 30 days before CART infusion or no prior RT. Result(s): Five patients received bridging-RT within 30 days of CART infusion. Median bridging-RT dose was 37.5 Gy and was completed a median of 13 days before infusion. No grade 3 (G3) or higher RT-toxicities occurred. No patients in the bridging-RT group experienced G3 or higher CART-related toxicities (CRS or neurotoxicity), and 23% (n = 6) and 15% (n = 4) experienced G3-5 CRS and G3-5 neurotoxicity in the NBRT group, respectively. Overall treatment response in the bridging-RT and NBRT groups was 80% and 64%, respectively. The axi-cel CART product was associated with CRS (odds ratio [OR] = 26.67, P =.001) and CRS correlated with neurotoxicity (OR = 12.22, P =.028). There was a trend toward an association for CRS with metabolic tumor volume (OR = 1.06/mL, P =.141) and TLG (OR = 1.01/mL x standard uptake value, P =.099). Conclusion(s): Bridging-RT before commercial CART does not appear to increase the risk for CART-related toxicities or negatively affect outcomes in r/rABL patients. No G3 or higher RT-toxicities occurred in this series. Pretreatment metabolic tumor burden may be associated with CART-associated CRS; however, larger patient numbers are required to elucidate significant associations.

4619,"Quantifying and improving the efficiency of Gamma Knife treatment plans for brain metastases: results of a 1-year audit OBJECT: A method for quantifying the efficiency of Gamma Knife treatment plans for metastases was previously implemented by the authors to retrospectively identify the least efficient plans and has provided insights into improved planning strategies. The aim of the current work was to ascertain whether those insights led to improved treatment plans.METHODS: Following completion of the initial study, a 1-year audit of metastasis plans created at St. James's Institute of Oncology was carried out. Audited recent plans were compared with the earlier plans of the initial study, in terms of their efficiency and dosimetric quality. The statistical significance of any differences between relevant plan parameters was quantified by Mann-Whitney U-tests. Comparisons were made between all plans and repeated for a reduced set of plans from which the smallest lesions treated with a single 4-mm shot were excluded. The plan parameters compared were a plan efficiency index (PEI), the number of shots, Paddick conformity index (PCI), gradient index (GI), and percent coverage (of the lesion by the prescription isodose).RESULTS: A total of 157 metastatic lesions were included in the audit and were compared with 241 in the initial study. In a comparison of all cases, the audited plans achieved a higher median PEI score than did the earlier plans from the initial study (1.08 vs 1.02), indicating improved efficiency of the audited plans. When the smallest lesions (for which there was little scope for varying plan strategy) were discounted, the improvement in median PEI score was greater (1.23 vs 1.03, p < 0.001). This improvement in efficiency corresponds to an estimated mean (maximum) time saving of 15% (66%) per lesion (11 minutes [64 minutes] on the day of treatment). The modified planning strategy yielding these efficiency improvements did not rely on the use of significantly fewer shots (median 11 vs 11 shots, p = 0.924), nor did it result in significant detriment to dosimetric quality (median coverage 99% vs 99%, median PCI 0.84 vs 0.83, p = 0.449, and median GI 2.72 vs 2.67, p = 0.701, audited plans vs initial plans, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Choice of planning strategy can substantially affect plan efficiency and thus strongly influence treatment time. Through increased emphasis on efficiency, resulting from the introduction of PEI combined with a modified planning strategy informed by previous work, it has been possible to reduce times for metastatic plans without compromising their dosimetric quality. Although the average time savings achieved per lesion are moderate, the potential benefits per patient are greater for those with multiple metastases. Reducing treatment times has clear benefits with regard to patient comfort and throughput. In addition, optimization of plan efficiency may potentially affect the biologically effective dose from Gamma Knife treatments and offers opportunity for further work.",Excluded,0.08707317
4620,"A Light-Addressable Potentiometric Sensor for Odorant Detection Using Single Bioengineered Olfactory Sensory Neurons as Sensing Element A light-addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS), a silicon-based surface potential detector, is combined with bioengineered olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) for odorant detection. A LAPS chip is used as a transducer to monitor cell membrane potential changes. In addition, a focused movable laser with a diameter comparable to cell sizes is employed to select the desirable single cell for measurement under a microscope. Bioengineered OSNs are coupled to the LAPS surface and employed as sensing elements, which are prepared by the expression of an olfactory receptor of C. elegans, ODR-10, on the plasma membrane of rat primary OSNs via transient transfection. The responses of bioengineered OSNs to diacetyl, isoamyl acetate, and acetic acid are monitored by extracellular recording using the LAPS chip. Features of the recorded extracellular potential firings are analyzed in frequency and time domains. We have shown that bioengineered OSNs can generate specific response signals upon the stimulation of diacetyl, which is the natural ligand of ODR-10. Moreover, different concentrations of diacetyl can elicit different temporal firing patterns in bioengineered OSNs, which permits the concentration detection of specific odorant molecules in solution.",Excluded,0.086105
4621,"Clinical outcome and prognostic factors for central neurocytoma Purpose/Objective(s): Central neurocytomas are intraventricular neoplasms of the central nervous system that comprise 0.25- 0.5% of brain tumors and their optimal management remains controversial due to their rarity. We assessed clinical outcome for a historical cohort of neurocytoma patients and evaluated effects of tumor atypia, tumor size, extent of resection (EOR), and adjuvant radiation (RT). Materials/Methods: Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from date of first surgical resection. Differences in PFS were measured by Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazard ratio methods. Tumor atypia was defined as MIB-1 index >2%, focal necrosis, or microvascular proliferation, as previously established. Result(s): A total of 22 patients (14 males, 8 females) were treated between 1995 and 2009, with a median age at diagnosis of 24 years (range 11-62). A total of 8 patients experienced recurrent/progressive disease. Median follow-up by MRI was 38 month (range 0.1-183) for those who have not progressed. Overall 3-yr PFS was 70% (CI 41-86%). Only three patients died and all had atypical tumors. For the remaining patients, median follow-up for survival was 51 month (range 0.1-183). We examined effects of tumor atypia and MIB-1 labeling. Ten of 22 tumors had atypical features. There was near 100% concordance between tumor atypia and MIB-1 labeling: only 1 tumor was atypical based on microvascular proliferation but had MIB-1 <= 2%. Three-year PFS was 78% for MIB labeling <= 2% and 39% for MIB labeling >2% (HR 7.7, CI 2 - 40, p = 0.016). Median tumor diameter was 4.3 cm (range 0.8-8.6 cm). Three-yr PFS was 48% (CI 21-77%) for tumor >4.3 cm and 74.1% (CI 29-93%) for tumor <=4.3 cm (HR 1.6, CI 0.5 - 6.6, p = 0.49). We examined influence of EOR and adjuvant RT. Five patients had gross total resection (GTR), and 17 had subtotal resection (STR). No patient had a biopsy only. Seven patients progressed after STR, and one patient recurred after GTR. None of the GTR patients received adjuvant RT and four of the STR patients received adjuvant RT. Three-year PFS rates by extent of resection and adjuvant RT are shown (in table below). Conclusion(s): For patients with central neurocytoma, MIB-1 labeling index >2% significantly predicts worse outcome. The additional criteria for tumor atypia did not add useful prognostic information. Although patient numbers are too small for conclusive confirmation, our data indicate that lesser EOR and larger tumors size may confer worse prognosis and adjuvant RTafter STR may improve PFS.

[Chinese] Objective: To explore the possible relationship between angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), Tie-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and radiation brain injury (RBI) and detect the expressions of VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2 in co-cultured endothelial cells and astrocytes after an irradiation of X-ray. Method(s): Murine brain microvascular endothelial cells bEnd. 3 and astrocytes were co-cultured in a Transwell culture plate and then exposed to X-ray at various doses (5, 10, 20 and 30 Gy) and cultured for 24 hours. The group without radiation acted as a control. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2. Result(s): As compared with the control group, the expression of VEGF increased in 5, 10, 20 and 30 Gy dose groups [(1.71 +/- 0.11), (2.03 +/- 0.05), (2.20 +/- 0.06), (2.19 +/- 0.08) vs (1.26 +/- 0.10), P < 0.05] ; the expression of Ang-1 decreased in 5, 10, 20 and 30 Gy dose groups [(2.27 +/- 0.07), (2.28 +/- 0.06), (2.01 +/- 0.05), (1.54 +/- 0.08) vs (2.46 +/- 0.04), P < 0.05]; the expression of Tie-2 decreased in 5, 10, 20 and 30 Gy dose groups [(2.40 +/- 0.10), (2.47 +/- 0.06), (1.05 +/- 0.09), (1.00 +/- 0.08) vs(4.80 +/- 0.07), P < 0.05]; the expression of Ang-2 increased in 5 Gy and 10 Gy dose groups [(2.10 +/- 0.07), (2.43 +/- 0.08) vs (1.69 +/- 0.05), P < 0.05] while decreased in 20 Gy and 30 Gy dose groups [(1.12 +/- 0.10), (1.21 +/- 0.04) vs (1.69 +/- 0.05), P < 0.05]. Conclusion(s): X-ray could differentially affect the expressions of VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2 in co-cultured endothelial cells and astrocytes. And the differential expressions of VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2 may be related with microvascular injury in RBI. Copyright Â© 2014 by the Chinese Medical Association.",Included,0.9843299
4624,"Adaptive replanning strategies accounting for shrinkage in head and neck IMRT PURPOSE: Significant anatomic and volumetric changes occur in head and neck cancer patients during fractionated radiotherapy, and the actual dose can be considerably different from the original plan. The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate the differences between planned and delivered dose, (2) to investigate margins required for anatomic changes, and (3) to find optimal replanning strategies.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eleven patients, each with one planning and six weekly helical CTs, were included. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans were generated using the simultaneous integrated boost technique. Weekly CTs were rigidly registered to planning CT before deformable registration was performed. The following replanning strategies were investigated with different margins (0, 3, 5 mm): midcourse (one replan), every other week (two replans), and every week (six replans). Doses were accumulated on the planning CT for comparison of various dose indices for target and critical structures.RESULTS: The cumulative doses to targets were preserved even at the 0-mm margin. Doses to cord, brainstem, and mandible were unchanged. Significant increases in parotid doses were observed. Margin reduction from 5 to 0 mm led to a 22% improvement in parotid mean dose. Parotid sparing could be preserved with replanning. More frequent replanning led to better preservation; replanning more than once a week is unnecessary.CONCLUSION: Shrinkage does not result in significant dosimetric difference in targets and critical structures, except for the parotid gland, for which the mean dose increases by approximately 10%. The benefit of replanning is improved sparing of the parotid. The combination of replanning and reduced margins can provide up to a 30% difference in parotid dose.",Excluded,0.08621477
4625,"Dosimetric analysis of the brachial plexus among patients with breast cancer treated with post-mastectomy radiotherapy to the ipsilateral supraclavicular area: report of 3 cases of radiation-induced brachial plexus neuropathy BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the brachial plexus (BP) dose of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) to the ipsilateral supraclavicular (ISCL) area, and report the characteristics of radiation-induced brachial plexus neuropathy (RIBPN).METHODS: The BP dose of 31 patients who received adjuvant PMRT to the ISCL area and chest wall using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and the records of 3 patients with RIBPN were retrospectively analyzed based on the standardized Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-endorsed guidelines. The total dose to the ISCL area and chest wall was 50 Gy in 25 fractions.RESULTS: Patients with a higher number of removed lymph nodes (RLNs) had a higher risk of RIBPN (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.189, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.005-1.406, p = 0.044). In 31 patients treated with 3DCRT, the mean dose to the BP without irradiation to the ISCL area was significantly less than that with irradiation to the ISCL area (0.97 +/- 0.20 vs. 44.39 +/- 4.13 Gy, t = 136.75, p <0.001). In the 3DCRT plans with irradiation to the ISCL area and chest wall, the maximum dose to the BP was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.40, p = 0.026), body mass index (BMI) (r = -0.44, p = 0.014), and body weight (r = -0.45, p = 0.011). Symptoms of the 3 patients with RIBPN occurred 37-65 months after radiotherapy, and included progressive upper extremity numbness, pain, and motor disturbance. After treatment, 1 patient was stable, and the other 2 patients' symptoms worsened.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of RIBPN was higher in patients with a higher number of RLNs after PMRT. The dose to the BP is primarily from irradiation of the ISCL area, and is higher in slim and young patients. Prevention should be the main focus of managing RIBPN, and the BP should be considered an organ-at-risk when designing a radiotherapy plan for the ISCL area.",Excluded,0.2899601
4626,"Pulsed-wave low-dose ultrasound hyperthermia selectively enhances nanodrug delivery and improves antitumor efficacy for brain metastasis of breast cancer The clinical application of chemotherapeutics for brain tumors remains a challenge due to limitation of blood-brain barrier/blood-tumor barrier (BBB/BTB). In this study, we investigated the effects of low-dose focused ultrasound hyperthermia (UH) on the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) for brain metastasis of breast cancer. Murine breast cancer cells (4T1-luc2) expressing firefly luciferase were implanted into mouse striatum as a brain tumor model. The mice were intravenously injected with PLD with/without transcranial pulsed-wave/continuous-wave UH (pUH/cUH) treatment on day-6 after tumor implantation. pUH (frequency: 500 kHz, PRF: 1000 Hz, duty cycle: 50%) was conducted under equal acoustic power (2.2-Watt) and sonication duration (10-min) as cUH. The amounts of doxorubicin accumulated in the normal brain and tumor tissues were measured with fluorometry. The tumor growth responses for the control, pUH, PLD, PLD + cUH, and PLD + pUH groups were evaluated with IVIS. The PLD distribution and cell apoptosis were assessed with immunofluorescence staining. The results showed that pUH significantly enhanced the PLD delivery into brain tumors and the tumor growth was further inhibited by PLD + pUH without damaging the sonicated normal brain tissues. This indicates that low-dose transcranial pUH is a promising method to selectively enhance nanodrug delivery and improve the brain tumor treatment.

Selecting appropriate treatment remains a challenging problem for orthopedic physicians. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical effects of minimally invasive adjustable plate and locking compression plate in treatment of unstable pelvic fractures via posterior approach.METHODS: From January 2009 to June 2012, fifty-six patients with unstable pelvic fractures were included. After at least 12-month follow-up, forty-four patients treated with two methods were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups: minimally invasive adjustable plate (group A) and locking compression plate (group B). Preoperative and postoperative radiography was taken to assess the fracture displacement and reduction quality. The size of incision, operation duration, blood loss, duration of X-ray exposures, Majeed postoperative functional evaluation and Lindahl postoperative reduction evaluation were analyzed.RESULTS: The mean follow-up in group A was 27.3 months (range, 13-48 months), and that in group B was 21.8 months (range, 12-42 months). There were no iatrogenic neurovascular injuries during the operations in the two groups. In group B, malunion was observed in one patient, and infection of incision was observed in one case. The operation duration, blood loss, and size of incision of group A were significantly less than that of group B. There was no significant difference in the duration of X-ray exposures between the two groups. The Majeed functional evaluation score in group A was significantly higher than that in group B. The difference of the imaging score of the retained displacement was not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Both the two methods can effectively stabilize the unstable pelvic fractures. However, the minimally invasive adjustable plate has the advantages of minimally invasive, less radiation exposure, technically safe and time saving. Minimally invasive adjustable plate is a good supplementary option for treating posterior pelvic ring injuries.",Excluded,0.08952495
4629,"NF-kappaB activation in light-induced retinal degeneration in a mouse model PURPOSE: To investigate the modulation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in light-induced photoreceptor degeneration in a mouse model.METHODS: Mice were exposed to intense green light. Light-induced activation of NF-kappaB and its nuclear localization were studied by immunohistochemistry. The NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in the retinas after exposure to light was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Nuclear transactivation of NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor cells was determined by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. The amount of NF-kappaB p65 in the photoreceptor cells after exposure to light was assessed by Western blot analysis. To obtain more photoreceptor-specific information, microdissected photoreceptor cells were used in some studies.RESULTS: By an immunohistochemical method, the perinuclear region of the photoreceptor cells was heavily labeled with an antibody to activated NF-kappaB after a 1-hour exposure to light. Nuclear localization of NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor nucleus was seen at 12 hours. In the experiments involving 3 hours of exposure to light followed by recovery in the dark, nuclear localization of NF-kappaB was also noted after 12 hours' recovery in the dark. During continuous exposure to light, the NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity gradually increased and reached its maximum at 12 hours. There was an increase of NF-kappaB p65 protein at 3 hours. The mRNA levels of IkappaBalpha were upregulated after 6 hours' exposure to light.CONCLUSIONS: Intense light activated NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor cells in vivo, increased the NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity, and increased the expression of mRNA of IkappaBalpha, a target gene of NF-kappaB.",Excluded,0.086363256
4630,"Computerized tomography perfusion predictors of clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator Objective: Computerized Tomography Perfusion (CTP) is used to assess physiological brain tissue parameters in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Its utility for patients presenting within the 3 hrs time window is unknown and questionable given possible delay of thrombolytic administration and additional exposure to radiation. We addressed whether parameters on CTP for AIS patients treated with IV t-PA within 3 hrs of onset are predictive of good or bad outcome. Method(s): We retrospectively identified patients from our stroke registry (7/07 to 2/10) who presented with AIS and underwent CTP and then received tPA within 3 hrs of symptom onset. Patients that underwent intra-arterial therapy were excluded. A neuroradiologist blinded to outcome performed CTP measurements on a commercially available Siemens Neuro PCT workstation. Total perfusion deficit was defined as the area of infarct territory with a relative time to peak greater than 4s compared to the contralateral side (TTP). Nonviable tissue (NVT) was defined as the area of infarct territory with absolute cerebral blood volume (CBV) less than 2ml/100g. Penumbra was defined as the area of TTP minus the area of CBV. Good clinical outcome (GCO) was defined as mRS 0-2, and poor clinical outcome (PCO) was defined as mRS 5-6 at hospital discharge. Clinical perfusion mismatch (CPM) was defined as admit NIHSS >= 8 and NVT <=25cm<sup>2</sup>. Result(s): We identified 44 patients with a mean age of 68 years , median NIHSS on admission of 13 and median discharge mRS of 4. NVT was statistically different in those with poor outcome (Table 1) and a strong predictor of poor outcome when NVT was greater than 50 cm<sup>2</sup> (OR=6 , 95%CI: 1.05-34, p=0.044). TTP was statistically different in patients that achieved and did not achieve GCO (Table 1; OR=0.97, 95%CI: 0.95- 1, p=0.037). There was no statistical correlation between penumbra area, percentage penumbra, and CPM with GCO in univariate analysis. Younger age and lower admission NIHSS were associated with GCO and higher NIHSS was associated with PCO. Using multivariate logistic regression controlling for age and admission NIHSS, none of the CTP parameters were statistically associated with outcome measures. Conclusion(s): CTP parameters derived from commercially available software and published thresholds do not provide useful value beyond the NIHSS for predicting good outcome for AIS patients treated with IV tPA within 3 hours of onset but may be useful in predicting poor outcome if the area of non-viable tissue is greater than 50 cm<sup>2</sup>.

4631,"Radiation exposure during transmission measurements: comparison between CT- and germanium-based techniques with a current PET scanner In positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning, transmission measurements for attenuation correction are commonly performed by using external germanium-68 rod sources. Recently, combined PET and computed tomographic (CT) scanners have been developed in which the CT data can be used for both anatomical-metabolic image formation and attenuation correction of the PET data. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference between germanium- and CT-based transmission scanning in terms of their radiation doses by using the same measurement technique and to compare the doses that patients receive during brain, cardiac and whole-body scans. Measurement of absorbed doses to organs was conducted by using a Rando Alderson phantom with thermoluminescent dosimeters. Effective doses were calculated according to the guidelines in the International Commission on Radiation Protection Publication Number 60. Compared with radionuclide doses used in routine 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET imaging, doses absorbed during germanium-based transmission scans were almost negligible. On the other hand, absorbed doses from CT-based transmission scans were significantly higher, particularly with a whole-body scanning protocol. Effective doses were 8.81 mSv in the high-speed mode and 18.97 mSv in the high-quality mode for whole-body CT-based transmission scans. These measurements revealed that the doses received by a patient during CT-based transmission scanning are more than those received in a typical PET examination. Therefore, the radiation doses represent a limitation to the generalised use of CT-based transmission measurements with current PET/CT scanner systems.",Excluded,0.08597962

The phenotypes are similar to those of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) disease, where there is a deficiency in a protein kinase that is activated by DNA damage, indicating that the Nbs and Atm proteins may participate in common pathways. Here we report that Nbs is specifically phosphorylated in response to gamma-radiation, ultraviolet light and exposure to hydroxyurea. Phosphorylation of Nbs mediated by gamma-radiation, but not that induced by hydroxyurea or ultraviolet light, was markedly reduced in ATM cells. In vivo, Nbs was phosphorylated on many serine residues, of which S343, S397 and S615 were phosphorylated by Atm in vitro. At least two of these sites were underphosphorylated in ATM cells. Inactivation of these serines by mutation partially abrogated Atm-dependent phosphorylation. Reconstituting NBS cells with a mutant form of Nbs that cannot be phosphorylated at selected, ATM-dependent serine residues led to a specific reduction in clonogenic survival after gamma-radiation. Thus, phosphorylation of Nbs by Atm is critical for certain responses of human cells to DNA damage.",Excluded,0.08695152

This study is to investigate the effect of near-infrared laser irradiation on neural activities at the cortex level. A 850-nm pigtailed diode laser was applied to stimulate the rat primary visual cortex while the horizontal black and white stripe pattern was used as standard visual stimulation to evoke visual-evoked potential (VEP). Both amplitude and latency of VEP P100 was measured with or without infrared pulse stimulation applied in rat primary visual cortex. Paired t test and one-way analysis of variance were used to evaluate the impact of infrared irradiation and its pulse width on the amplitudes and latencies of P100, respectively. The results from our preliminary study revealed that, the pulsed near-infrared laser depressed the VEP amplitude and shortened the latency of P100; with the increment of pulse width of infrared irradiation, further decline of VEP amplitude and much shortened latency of P100 were observed. The present work suggests that near-infrared laser irradiation can alter the neural activities in primary visual cortex transiently, and could provide a novel contactless artificial neural stimulus to brain cortex with high spatial selectivity.",Excluded,0.08602464
4635,"Distinct inhibition of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels by delta-opioid agonists in dorsal root ganglion neurons devoid of functional T-type Ca2+ currents Both mu- and delta-opioid agonists selectively inhibit nociception but have little effect on other sensory modalities. Voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels in the primary sensory neurons are important for the regulation of nociceptive transmission. In this study, we determined the effect of delta-opioid agonists on voltage-activated Ca(2+) channel currents (I(Ca)) in small-diameter rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons that do and do not bind isolectin B(4) (IB(4)). The delta-opioid agonists [d-Pen(2),d-Pen(5)]-enkephalin (DPDPE) and deltorphin II produced a greater inhibition of high voltage-activated I(Ca) in IB(4)-negative than IB(4)-positive neurons. Furthermore, DPDPE produced a greater inhibition of N-, P/Q-, and L-type I(Ca) in IB(4)-negative than IB(4)-positive neurons. However, DPDPE had no significant effect on the R-type I(Ca) in either type of cells. We were surprised to find that DPDPE failed to inhibit either the T-type or high voltage-activated I(Ca) in all the DRG neurons with T-type I(Ca). Double immunofluorescence labeling showed that the majority of the delta-opioid receptor-immunoreactive DRG neurons had IB(4) labeling, while all DRG neurons immunoreactive to delta-opioid receptors exhibited Cav(3.2) immunoreactivity. Additionally, DPDPE significantly inhibited high voltage-activated I(Ca) in Tyrode's or N-methyl-d-glucamine solution but not in tetraethylammonium solution. This study provides new information that delta-opioid agonists have a distinct effect on voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels in different phenotypes of primary sensory neurons. High voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels are more sensitive to inhibition by delta-opioid agonists in IB(4)-negative than IB(4)-positive neurons, and this opioid effect is restricted to DRG neurons devoid of functional T-type Ca(2+) currents.",Excluded,0.08565147
4636,"Technical and dosimetric considerations in multi-isocenter intensity modulated radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma with small multileaf collimator Multileaf collimator (MLC)-assisted intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has greatly improved the target coverage and avoidance of organs at risk (OAR) for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma; however, its implementation is also constrained by the features of the MLC. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma tends to have a large gross target volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV) due to its biological characteristics. More than one isocenter may be needed when small MLCs (i.e., BrainLAB M3, whose largest field is 10 x 10 cm(2)) are used to treat the nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The BrainLAB IMRT system was used to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-isocenter IMRT plan for treating nasopharyngeal cancers. Dose coverage of GTVs and CTVs were compared among IMRT plans with 1, 2 and 3 isocenters, as were dose objectives for OARs including brainstem, cord, and parotids. The dosimetric variation and the delivery time were also measured with a phantom. IMRT plans with more than 1 isocenter achieved a better dose coverage, homogeneity, and conformity on GTVs and CTVs; however, with risk of higher doses given to OARs. In most cases, one can generate satisfactory IMRT plans using the 2-isocenter IMRT planning strategy.

4638,"Sodium sulfide selectively induces oxidative stress, DNA damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction and radiosensitizes glioblastoma (GBM) cells Glioblastoma (GBM) has a poor prognosis despite intensive treatment with surgery and chemoradiotherapy. Previous studies using dose-escalated radiotherapy have demonstrated improved survival; however, increased rates of radionecrosis have limited its use. Development of radiosensitizers could improve patient outcome. In the present study, we report the use of sodium sulfide (Na<sub>2</sub>S), a hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) donor, to selectively kill GBM cells (T98G and U87) while sparing normal human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3). Na<sub>2</sub>S also decreased mitochondrial respiration, increased oxidative stress and induced gammaH2AX foci and oxidative base damage in GBM cells. Since Na<sub>2</sub>S did not significantly alter T98G capacity to perform non-homologous end-joining or base excision repair, it is possible that GBM cell killing could be attributed to increased damage induction due to enhanced reactive oxygen species production. Interestingly, Na<sub>2</sub>S enhanced mitochondrial respiration, produced a more reducing environment and did not induce high levels of DNA damage in hCMEC/D3. Taken together, this data suggests involvement of mitochondrial respiration in Na<sub>2</sub>S toxicity in GBM cells. The fact that survival of LN-18 GBM cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (rho<sup>0</sup>) was not altered by Na<sub>2</sub>S whereas the survival of LN-18 rho<sup>+</sup> cells was compromised supports this conclusion. When cells were treated with Na<sub>2</sub>S and photon or proton radiation, GBM cell killing was enhanced, which opens the possibility of H<sub>2</sub>S being a radiosensitizer. Therefore, this study provides the first evidence that H<sub>2</sub>S donors could be used in GBM therapy to potentiate radiation-induced killing.",Excluded,0.08909658
4639,"Cognitive impairment and spontaneous epilepsy in rats with malformations of cortical development Purpose: To examine the cognition, spontaneous epilepsy, and electroencephalography (EEG) characteristics of rats with malformations of cortical development (MCD) and their use as an animal model for investigating the pathogenesis of intractable epilepsy and screening novel antiepileptic drugs. Method(s): An epileptic rat model of MCD was established with the F1 generation of pregnant rats after X-irradiation with 175 cGy (Group L), 195 cGy (Group M), or 215 cGy (Group H). Long-term video-EEG monitoring was used to record the seizures in the rats with MCD. Cognition was assessed with the Morris water maze. The EEGs were recorded and analyzed in the frontal and parietal lobes and hippocampi of adult rats. Finally, the brain tissues were processed for Nissl staining. Result(s): The model groups exhibited markedly prolonged escape latencies and distinct decrements in the percent distance traveled in the target quadrant and platform-crossing frequency. These findings were dose-dependent. Frequent interictal epileptiform discharges were observed in the frontal and parietal lobes and hippocampi of adult rats, and their incidences were markedly higher in the model groups compared with that in the normal controls, with Group M having the highest incidence. Spontaneous seizures were observed in the model groups (mean incidence, 46.7%). The daily mean frequency of seizures and the incidence of spontaneous seizures were highest in Group M. Nissl staining revealed a dose-dependent pattern of hippocampal abnormalities, cortical and subcortical nodular heterotopia, and callosal agenesis in the model groups. Conclusion(s): The 195 cGy dose was most appropriate for establishing an epileptic model of MCD with X-irradiation. Copyright Â© 2015 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

4640,"Impact of dose boost in skull base on recurrence of stage T4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma. [Chinese] BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The recurrence rate in skull base is high for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement. This study was conducted to explore the impact of dose boost in skull base on the recurrence in skull base and survival of NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement. METHOD(S): A total of 120 stage T4 NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement proved by histopathology and computed tomography (CT) were treated in our hospital from Oct. 1996 to Nov. 1998. The irradiation dose was (71.55+/-3.09) Gy in nasopharynx and (58.95+/-6.16) Gy in neck. Of the 120 patients, 27 received irradiation (6-10 Gy) in skull base after radiotherapy (boost group), 93 did not receive irradiation in skull base (control group). Fifty-three patients, 41 in control group and 12 in boost group, received cisplatin-based chemotherapy for 1-3 cycles. The survival rates and the recurrence of the 2 groups were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. RESULT(S): The clinical characteristics of patients were similar in the 2 groups. The 1-, 3-, 5-year skull base control rates were significantly higher in boost group than in control group (100% vs. 93.4%, 91.8% vs. 76.4%, and 86.8% vs. 65.1%, respectively, P=0.045). The 1-, 3-, 5-year disease-freely survival rates were slightly higher in boost group than in control group (85.2% vs. 75.3%, 59.3% vs. 45.2%, and 51.9% vs. 31.2%, respectively, P=0.084). The median disease-freely survival time was longer in boost group than in control group (60 months vs. 30 months). The prevalences of irradiation-induced brain damage were 7.4% in boost group and 4.3% in control group with no significant difference (P=0.514). CONCLUSION(S): Dose boost in skull base can reduce the recurrence of stage T4 NPC in skull base and tends to enhance the disease-freely survival rate for NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvementu it is recommended to such patients.",Excluded,0.9653584
4641,"Whole cell recordings of intrinsic properties and sound-evoked responses from the inferior colliculus Response features of inferior colliculus (IC) neurons to both current injections and tone bursts were studied with in vivo whole cell recordings in awake Mexican free-tailed bats. Of 160 cells recorded, 95% displayed one of three general types of discharge patterns in response to the injection of positive current: 1) sustained discharges; 2) adapting discharges; and 3) onset-bursting discharges. Sustained neurons were the most common type (N=78), followed by onset-bursting (N=57). The least common type was adapting (N=17). In 90 neurons the profiles of synaptic and discharge activity evoked by tones of different frequencies at 50 dB SPL were recorded. Three major tone-evoked response profiles were obtained; 1) neurons dominated by excitation (N=32) in which tones evoked excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) or EPSPs with discharges over a range of frequencies with little or no evidence of inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) evoked by frequencies that flanked the excitation; 2) neurons that had an excitatory frequency region in which discharges were evoked that was flanked by frequencies that evoked predominantly IPSPs (N=26); 3) neurons in which all frequencies evoked IPSPs with little or no depolarizations (N=32). The question we asked is whether IC cells that express a particular profile of PSPs and discharges to acoustic stimulation also have the same current-evoked response profile. We show that, with one exception, the intrinsic features of an IC neuron are not correlated with the pattern of its synaptic innervation; the two features are unrelated in the majority of IC cells. The exception is a subtype of inhibitory dominated cell where most frequencies evoked IPSPs to both the onset and to the offset of the tone bursts. In those cells injected current steps always evoked an onset-bursting response.",Excluded,0.08613395
4642,"Lack of the alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 1 causes tremors, seizures, and early postnatal death in mice The Na(+)-independent alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 1 (Asc-1) is exclusively expressed in neuronal structures throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Asc-1 transports small neutral amino acids with high affinity especially for D-serine and glycine (K(i): 8-12 microM), two endogenous glutamate co-agonists that activate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors through interacting with the strychnine-insensitive glycine binding-site. By regulating D-serine (and possibly glycine) levels in the synaptic cleft, Asc-1 may play an important role in controlling neuronal excitability. We generated asc-1 gene knockout (asc-1(-/-)) mice to test this hypothesis. Behavioral phenotyping combined with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings revealed that asc-1(-/-) mice developed tremors, ataxia, and seizures that resulted in early postnatal death. Both tremors and seizures were reduced by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. Extracellular recordings from asc-1(-/-) brain slices indicated that the spontaneous seizure activity did not originate in the hippocampus, although, in this region, a relative increase in evoked synaptic responses was observed under nominal Mg(2+)-free conditions. Taken together with the known neurochemistry and neuronal distribution of the Asc-1 transporter, these results indicate that the mechanism underlying the behavioral hyperexcitability in mutant mice is likely due to overactivation of NMDA receptors, presumably resulting from elevated extracellular D-serine. Our study provides the first evidence to support the notion that Asc-1 transporter plays a critical role in regulating neuronal excitability, and indicate that the transporter is vital for normal CNS function and essential to postnatal survival of mice.",Excluded,0.086233206
4643,"Efficacy and safety of transdermal fentanyl for the treatment of oral mucositis pain caused by chemoradiotherapy in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma PURPOSE: Oral mucositis is one of the most painful side effects found in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. The transdermal route of administration is worthy of investigation for patients who suffer from dysphagia due to severe oral mucositis. In this phase 2 study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of transdermal fentanyl (TDF) for mucositis pain caused by chemoradiotherapy in ESCC patients.METHODS: Forty-six ESCC patients who experienced moderate to severe oral mucosal pain during chemoradiotherapy received TDF for pain relief. The assessment of pain was made according to the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Efficacy and safety of TDF was collected and conducted in an open-label fashion. The analgesic effect, quality of life, and side effects were evaluated after the administration of transdermal fentanyl using the paired sample Wilcoxon signed rank test.RESULTS: The mucositis-induced pain disappeared in 31 (67.4 %) patients during the treatment with transdermal fentanyl with the median time of onset at day 6.6 (range 3-14). The median Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score was reduced from 6 (range 3-9) before treatment to 4.5 (range 2-9), 3 (range 2-8), 2.5 (range 1-8), 2 (range 0-6), and 0 (range 0-4) on days 3, 6, 9, 11, and 15, respectively, after treatment (P < 0.001). The patients' quality of life also improved significantly (P < 0.01).

4644,"Prolonged photoresponses in transgenic mouse rods lacking arrestin Arrestins are soluble cytoplasmic proteins that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors, thus switching off activation of the G protein and terminating the signalling pathway that triggers the cellular response. Although visual arrestin has been shown to quench the catalytic activity of photoexcited, phosphorylated rhodopsin in a reconstituted system, its role in the intact rod cell remains unclear because phosphorylation alone reduces the catalytic activity of rhodopsin. Here we have recorded photocurrents of rods from transgenic mice in which one or both copies of the arrestin gene were disrupted. Photoresponses were unaffected when arrestin expression was halved, indicating that arrestin binding is not rate limiting for recovery of the rod photoresponse, as it is in Drosophila. With arrestin absent, the flash response displayed a rapid partial recovery followed by a prolonged final phase. This behaviour indicates that an arrestin-independent mechanism initiates the quench of rhodopsin's catalytic activity and that arrestin completes the quench. The intensity dependence of the photoresponse in rods lacking arrestin further suggests that, although arrestin is required for normal signal termination, it does not participate directly in light adaptation.",Excluded,0.0862693
4645,"Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation for Patients with Surgically Resected Small Cell Lung Cancer INTRODUCTION: Data on prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) after complete resection of SCLC are limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of PCI in this population.METHODS: We retrospectively identified completely resected SCLC at the Shanghai Chest Hospital between January 2006 and January 2014.RESULTS: A total of 349 patients (115 patients who received PCI [the PCI-treated cohort] and 234 patients who did not [the non-PCI-treated cohort]) were included in the study. The results demonstrated that the PCI-treated cohort had longer overall survival than the non-PCI-treated cohort among patients with pathologic stage (p-stage) II (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30-0.99, p = 0.047) and p-stage III (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34-0.86, p = 0.009) disease. Among patients with p-stage III disease, there was a significantly higher risk for cerebral recurrence from the time of diagnosis in the non-PCI-treated cohort (p = 0.018). With regard to patients with p-stage I disease, neither overall survival benefit (HR = 1.61, 95% CI: 0.68-3.83, p = 0.282) nor risk for cerebral recurrence (p = 0.389) was significant between the PCI-treated and non-PCI-treated cohorts.CONCLUSIONS: The data presented in the current study support using PCI in patients with p-stage II/III disease but not in patients with p-stage I disease. A relatively lower risk for brain metastases in p-stage I patients might explain the inferior efficacy of PCI in this population.",Included,0.98381674
4646,"Effects of ion channel blocks on electrical activity of stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley neural network under electromagnetic induction The effects of channel blocks on the spontaneous spiking activity and neuron networks pattern selection are investigated by using an improved Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model in which the electromagnetic induction is considered and the magnetic flux is used to describe the influence of electromagnetic field. The discharge behavior of neurons induced by potassium ion and sodium ion channel blocks was analyzed by numerical simulation in the improved HH model. The results suggest that changes in the maximum conductance of potassium channels can cause spontaneous discharge behavior of neurons. The poisoning of potassium ion can be weakened by the electromagnetic radiation in the neural network, and the neural network presents a state of spatial order in the case of spiral waves. It is interesting that the ordered waveform is generated by no-flux boundary condition when the initial states are selected as wedge-shaped type in the network. In addition, potassium channel blocks can promote the discharge of neurons and facilitate the formation of spiral waves in the neural network. By contrast, the electrical activity of neurons is inhibited by sodium channel blocks. The influence of membrane patch size on the electrical activity of single neuron is greater than that on the collective behavior of neural network. This research will enhance understanding of the role of toxins in neuronal firing and collective behavior of real neural systems. Copyright Â© 2017",Excluded,0.08603215

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil (TPF) chemotherapy was administered. The prescribed dose was 66-70.4 Gy to the GTV_P while maintaining all the critical neurologic organs within dose constraints.Results: The local response rate was 88.6% after induction chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 48.5 months, the 3-year local failure-free survival (LFFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 92.4% and 89.6%, respectively. The average Dmin to the GTV_P was 59.4 Gy (range, 48.3-70.4 Gy). Additionally, 54.0 Gy was identified as the optimal cut-off Dmin to the GTV_P, and the Dmin >=54.0 Gy group had a better local complete response rate after IMRT (52.4% vs. 81.3%, chi2 = 7.335, P = 0.007), a better 3-year LFFS (95.9% vs. 78.4%, P = 0.005) and a better OS (93.3% vs. 75.9%, P = 0.003). Furthermore, a multivariate analysis found the Dmin to the GTV_P >=54.0 Gy to be prognostically important for LFFS and OS. One patient (1%) developed asymptomatic temporal lobe necrosis, but no other neurological dysfunctions were observed.Conclusions: For T3-4-stage NPC treated with IMRT plus TPF chemotherapy, excellent local control with few late toxicities was achieved. A Dmin >=54.0 Gy to the GTV_P may confer better local control. New ways to increase the Dmin to the GTV_P as far as possible without increasing late toxicities are urgently required.",Excluded,0.08761798
4649,"FDTD analysis of a noninvasive hyperthermia system for brain tumors Hyperthermia is considered one of the new therapeutic modalities for cancer treatment and is based on the difference in thermal sensitivity between healthy tissues and tumors. During hyperthermia treatment, the temperature of the tumor is raised to 40-45degreeC for a definite period resulting in the destruction of cancer cells. This paper investigates design, modeling and simulation of a new non-invasive hyperthermia applicator system capable of effectively heating deep seated as well as superficial brain tumors using inexpensive, simple, and easy to fabricate components without harming surrounding healthy brain tissues. The proposed hyperthermia applicator system is composed of an air filled partial half ellipsoidal chamber, a patch antenna, and a head model with an embedded tumor at an arbitrary location. The irradiating antenna is placed at one of the foci of the hyperthermia chamber while the center of the brain tumor is placed at the other focus. The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method is used to compute both the SAR patterns and the temperature distribution in three different head models due to two different patch antennas at a frequency of 915 MHz. The obtained results suggest that by using the proposed noninvasive hyperthermia system it is feasible to achieve sufficient and focused energy deposition and temperature rise to therapeutic values in deep seated as well as superficial brain tumors without harming surrounding healthy tissue. The proposed noninvasive hyperthermia system proved suitable for raising the temperature in tumors embedded in the brain to therapeutic values by carefully selecting the systems components. The operator of the system only needs to place the center of the brain tumor at a pre-specified location and excite the antenna at a single frequency of 915 MHz. Our study may provide a basis for a clinical applicator prototype capable of heating brain tumors.",Excluded,0.08578352
4650,"Robust/optimal temperature profile control of a high-speed aerospace vehicle using neural networks An approximate dynamic programming (ADP)-based suboptimal neurocontroller to obtain desired temperature for a high-speed aerospace vehicle is synthesized in this paper. A 1-D distributed parameter model of a fin is developed from basic thermal physics principles. ""Snapshot"" solutions of the dynamics are generated with a simple dynamic inversion-based feedback controller. Empirical basis functions are designed using the ""proper orthogonal decomposition"" (POD) technique and the snapshot solutions. A low-order nonlinear lumped parameter system to characterize the infinite dimensional system is obtained by carrying out a Galerkin projection. An ADP-based neurocontroller with a dual heuristic programming (DHP) formulation is obtained with a single-network-adaptive-critic (SNAC) controller for this approximate nonlinear model. Actual control in the original domain is calculated with the same POD basis functions through a reverse mapping. Further contribution of this paper includes development of an online robust neurocontroller to account for unmodeled dynamics and parametric uncertainties inherent in such a complex dynamic system. A neural network (NN) weight update rule that guarantees boundedness of the weights and relaxes the need for persistence of excitation (PE) condition is presented. Simulation studies show that in a fairly extensive but compact domain, any desired temperature profile can be achieved starting from any initial temperature profile.

Brain metastases (BM) from these tumors are considered unlikely to be controlled using the relatively low doses used in whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Our objective was to analyze the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on local control and overall survival of BM from radioresistant primary tumors. We reviewed all patients who received Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) for BM at Columbia University Medical Center between January 2009 and April 2014. All patients were treated using the Gamma Knife Perfexion System. Dosimetric data was collected from treatment plans and metastases were categorized as radioresistant or not. Response was assessed by reviewing follow-up brain imaging studies and classified according to RECIST. Local control and median overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. In total, 373 tumors were analyzed from 126 patients. Of these tumors, 49 (13.1 %) originated from radioresistant cancers. The overall local control rate in the radioresistant cohort was 89.8 and 90.1 % in the non-radioresistant cohort. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that radioresistance status of the primary tumor had no statistically significant effect on local control with hazard ratios of 1.0 (p = 1.0, 95 % CI 0.388-2.576) and 0.954 (p = 0.926, 95 % CI 0.349-2.603) respectively. Median overall survival for both radioresistant and non-radioresistant cohorts was 20.0 months, with a p value of 0.926. There was no significant difference in local control of BM from radioresistant and non-radioresistant primary tumors treated with GKRS. Both cohorts showed excellent response and local control, suggesting that SRS upfront or in addition to WBRT may be an appropriate strategy in the treatment of BM from radioresistant cancers. Median overall survival for both cohorts was equal, suggesting that improved local control may be associated with an improvement in long-term survival.",Excluded,0.6044069

Lewy bodies include not only alpha-synuclein but also aggregates of other proteins. This fact raises a question as to whether the formation of alpha-synuclein amyloid fibrils in Lewy bodies may occur via interaction with fibrils derived from different proteins. To probe this hypothesis, we investigated in vitro fibril formation of human alpha-synuclein in the presence of preformed fibril seeds of various different proteins. We used three proteins, Escherichia coli chaperonin GroES, hen lysozyme, and bovine insulin, all of which have been shown to form amyloid fibrils. Very surprisingly, the formation of alpha-synuclein amyloid fibril was accelerated markedly in the presence of preformed seeds of GroES, lysozyme, and insulin fibrils. The structural characteristics of the natively unfolded state of alpha-synuclein may allow binding to various protein particles, which in turn triggers the formation (extension) of alpha-synuclein amyloid fibrils.

4654,"The possible neurobehavioral protective effects of natural antioxidant against phototoxicity attenuation of antimicrobial quinolone group in rats The fluoroquinolones absorb light in the 320 to 330 nm ultraviolet A (UV-A) wavelength and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide; thus, the photodynamic generation of ROS may be the basis of phototoxicity of quinolones in human beings and animals. This study aimed to evaluate the damaging effects of UV-A radiation at different periods of exposure on rats' brains administered with ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin administration in UV-A exposed animals exaggerated the brain-oxidative stress biomarkers and decreased the locomotor activity. Exposure of rats to UV-A for 60 minutes induced a significant increase of malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and a decrease in the values of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) compared to a normal one; these changes were UV-A exposure time-dependent. However, the administration of vitamin C to the UV-60-treated group decreased the values of MDA, MPO, and shifted the values of SOD, GSH toward the normal values. Vitamin C, probably due to its strong antioxidant properties, could improve and partially counteract the toxic effect of UV-A on oxidative stress parameters and prevent the damage in rat's brain tissues.",Excluded,0.08783378

In addition, an increased rate of dementia in young patients has been noted over the longer term, i.e. years.

This is reflected in the shapes of the tissue time activity curve. A statistical shape recognition algorithm of the gaussian mixture model is applied with considering spatial and temporal information on a reference region. We evaluate the BP<sub>ND</sub> with manually set reference region and AutoRef using 86 cases (43 positive cases, 10 equivocal cases, and 33 negative cases) of dynamically scanned <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh Compound-B.RESULTS: From the Bland-Altman plot, the difference between two BP<sub>ND</sub> is 0.099 +/- 0.21 as standard deviation, and no significant systematic error is observed between the BP<sub>ND</sub> with AutoRef and with manual definition of a reference region. Although a proportional error is detected, it is smaller than the 95% limits of agreement. Therefore, the proportional error is negligibly small.CONCLUSIONS: AutoRef presents the same performance as the manual definition of the reference region. Further, since AutoRef is more algorithmic than the ordinary manual definition of the reference region, there are few operator-oriented uncertainties in AutoRef. We thus conclude that AutoRef can be applied as an automatic delineating algorithm for the reference region in amyloid imaging.",Excluded,0.08618456

Among recently reported prognostic grading indexes, only the basic score for brain metastases (BSBM) is applicable to patients 65 years or older. However, the major weakness of this system is that no BM-related factors are graded. This prompted the authors to develop a new grading system, the elderly-specific (ES)-BSBM. METHODS For this IRB-approved, retrospective cohort study, the authors used their prospectively accumulated database comprising 3267 consecutive patients undergoing Gamma Knife SRS for BMs during the 1998-2016 period at the Mito GammaHouse. Among these 3267 patients, 1789 patients >= 65 years of age were studied (Yamamoto series [Y-series]). Another series of 1785 patients >= 65 years of age in whom Serizawa and colleagues performed Gamma Knife SRS during the same period (Serizawa series [S-series]) was used for validity testing of the ES-BSBM. RESULTS Two factors were identified as strongly impacting longer survival after SRS by means of multivariable analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model with a stepwise selection procedure. These factors are the number of tumors (solitary vs multiple: HR 1.450, 95% CI 1.299-1.621; p < 0.0001) and cumulative tumor volume (<= 15 cm<sup>3</sup> vs > 15 cm<sup>3</sup>: HR 1.311, 95% CI 1.078-1.593; p = 0.0067). The new index is the addition of scores 0 and 1 for these 2 factors to the BSBM. The ES-BSBM system is based on categorization into 3 classes by adding these 2 scores to those of the original BSBM. Each ES-BSBM category has 2 possible scores. For the category ES-BSBM 4-5, the score is either 4 or 5; for ES-BSBM 2-3, the score is either 2 or 3; and for ES-BSBM 0-1, the score is either 0 or 1. In the Y-series, the median survival times (MSTs, months) after SRS were 17.5 (95% CI 15.4-19.3) in ES-BSBM 4-5, 6.9 (95% CI 6.4-7.4) in ES-BSBM 2-3, and 2.8 (95% CI 2.5-3.6) in ES-BSBM 0-1 (p < 0.0001). Also, in the S-series, MSTs were, respectively, 20.4 (95% CI 17.2-23.4), 7.9 (95% CI 7.4-8.5), and 3.2 (95% CI 2.8-3.6) (p < 0.0001). The ES-BSBM system was shown to be applicable to patients with all primary tumor types as well as to those 80 years or older. CONCLUSIONS The authors found that the addition of the number of tumors and cumulative tumor volume as scoring factors to the BSBM system significantly improved the prognostic value of this index. The present study is strengthened by testing the ES-BSBM in a different patient group. Copyright Â©AANS 2018.",Excluded,0.44970778
4663,"A Multi-institutional Prospective Observational Study of Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Patients With Multiple Brain Metastases (JLGK0901 Study Update): Irradiation-related Complications and Long-term Maintenance of Mini-Mental State Examination Scores PURPOSE: The JLGK0901 study showed the noninferiority of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone as initial treatment of 5 to 10 brain metastases (BMs) compared with 2 to 4 BMs in terms of overall survival and most secondary endpoints (Lancet Oncol 2014;15:387-95). However, observation periods were not long enough to allow confirmation of the long-term safety of SRS alone in patients with 5 to 10 BMs.METHODS AND MATERIALS: This was a prospective observational study of Gamma Knife SRS-treated patients with 1 to 10 newly diagnosed BMs enrolled at 23 facilities between March 1, 2009, and February 15, 2012.RESULTS: The 1194 eligible patients were categorized into the following groups: group A, 1 tumor (n=455); group B, 2 to 4 tumors (n=531); and group C, 5 to 10 tumors (n=208). Cumulative rates of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score maintenance (MMSE score decrease <3 from baseline) determined with a competing risk analysis of groups A, B, and C were 93%, 91%, and 92%, respectively, at the 12th month after SRS; 91%, 89%, and 91%, respectively, at the 24th month; 89%, 88%, and 89%, respectively, at the 36th month; and 87%, 86%, and 89%, respectively, at the 48th month (hazard ratio [HR] of group A vs group B, 0.719; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.437-1.172; P=.18; HR of group B vs group C, 1.280; 95% CI, 0.696-2.508; P=.43). During observations ranging from 0.3 to 67.5 months (median, 12.0 months; interquartile range, 5.8-26.5 months), as of December 2014, 145 patients (12.1%) had SRS-induced complications. Cumulative complication incidences by competing risk analysis for groups A, B, and C were 7%, 8%, and 6%, respectively, at the 12th month after SRS; 10%, 11%, and 11%, respectively, at the 24th month; 11%, 11%, and 12%, respectively, at the 36th month; and 12%, 12%, and 13%, respectively, at the 48th month (HR of group A vs group B, 0.850; 95% CI, 0.592-1.220; P=.38; HR of group B vs group C, 1.052; 95% CI, 0.666-1.662, P=.83). Leukoencephalopathy occurred in 12 of the 1074 patients (1.1%) with follow-up magnetic resonance imaging and was detected after salvage whole-brain radiation therapy in 11 of these 12 patients. In these 11 patients, leukoencephalopathy was detected by magnetic resonance imaging 5.2 to 21.2 months (median, 11.0 months; interquartile range, 7.0-14.4 months) after whole-brain radiation therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Neither MMSE score maintenance nor post-SRS complication incidence differed among groups A, B, and C. This longer-term follow-up study further supports the already-reported noninferiority hypothesis of SRS alone for patients with 5 to 10 BMs versus 2 to 4 BMs.",Excluded,0.8545334
4664,"Noisy vestibular stimulation improves autonomic and motor responsiveness in central neurodegenerative disorders The vestibular nerves are known to influence neuronal circuits in the medullary cardiovascular areas and, through the cerebellar vermis, the basal ganglia and the limbic system. By means of noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), it might be possible to ameliorate blunted responsiveness of degenerated neuronal circuits of patients with multi system atrophy or Parkinson's disease, or both. We evaluated the effect of 24-hour noisy GVS on long-term heart rate dynamics in 7 patients with multi system atrophy and on daytime trunk activity dynamics in 12 patients with either levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease or levodopa-unresponsive parkinsonism. Six of the latter patients were also examined for cognitive performance by means of a continuous performance test. Short-range or high-frequency fluctuations of heart rate were significantly increased by the noisy GVS compared with sham stimulation, suggestive of improved autonomic, especially parasympathetic, responsiveness. Long-range antipersistency of trunk activity patterns probed by an autocorrelation measure was significantly increased by the noisy GVS, suggestive of quickening of bradykinesic rest-to-active transitions. The mean reaction time of the continuous performance test was also significantly decreased by the noisy GVS, without significant changes in either the omission or commission error ratios, which is suggestive of improved motor execution during the cognitive task. In conclusion, the noisy GVS is effective in boosting the neurodegenerative brains of patients with multi system atrophy or Parkinson's disease, or both, including those unresponsive to standard levodopa therapy; it is also effective in improving these patients' autonomic and motor responsiveness.",Excluded,0.08577561
4665,"Neurones with epileptiform discharge in the central nervous system and chronic pain. Experimental and clinical investigations Epileptiform discharge was recorded from neurons in the thalamic nuclei of chronic pain patients during stereotactic surgery. Hyperactive neurons showed regular firing of 3-5 trains of epileptic-like group discharges with a frequency of 4 to 5 Hz. As described by Lombard et al. (1979), we operated on the dorsal root unilaterally, sectioning C5 to Thl in male Wistar rats. One to three months after the operation, hyperactive neurons were examined in the contra-lateral thalamic nuclei (VP, zona incerta), and lemniscus medialis. The firing patterns and distribution of hyperactive neurons in these animals was very similar to those of humans. The hyperactive neuron was unaffected by electrical stimulation of the nucleus raphe dorsalis (NRD) and locus ceruleus (LC). Administration of phenytoin and diazepam reduced the firing. However, no effect was seen with valproic acid. During spreading depression of the sensorimotor cortex, a remarkable reduction was seen on the firing of thalamic hyperactive neurons. This suggested that hyperactive neurons of the thalamic nuclei received facilitory effects from the sensorimotor cortex with little influence from adrenergic or serotoenergic systems.",Excluded,0.0858927
4666,"Preventive and curative effects of radon inhalation on chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain in mice BACKGROUND: Radon therapy is clinically useful for the treatment of pain-related diseases. However, there have been no studies regarding the effects of radon inhalation on neuropathic pain. In this study, we aimed to determine whether radon inhalation actually induced a remission of neuropathic pain and improved the quality of life.METHODS: First, we investigated the antinociceptive effects of radon inhalation in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain. We evaluated pain behaviour in mice before and after CCI surgery, using von Frey test. Pretreated mice received CCI surgery immediately after 24-h inhalation of radon at background (BG) concentration (c. 19 Bq/m(3) ), or at a concentration of 1000 or 2000 Bq/m(3) , and post-treated mice inhaled similar levels of radon 2 days after CCI surgery.RESULTS: CCI surgery induced mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia on a plantar surface of mice, as assessed using von Frey test, and 2000 Bq/m(3) radon inhalation alleviated hyperalgesic conditions 22-37% compared to BG level concentration. Concurrently, CCI surgery increased norepinephrine (NE), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations in plasma, and leukocyte migration in paws. Furthermore, CCI-induced neuropathy reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Treatment with radon inhalation, specifically at a concentration of 2000 Bq/m(3) , produced antinociceptive effects, i.e., lowered plasma TNF-alpha, NE and NO levels and restored SOD activity, as well as pain-related behaviour.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that inhalation of 2000 Bq/m(3) radon prevented and alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain in mice.",Excluded,0.6825279
4667,"The prospective self-controlled study of two different percutaneous pedicle screw insertion positions for treatment of thoracolumbar fracture in seven-year minimum follow-up Purpose: To test the hypothesis that different percutaneous pedicle screw insertion position would increase the likelihood of facet joint injury and degeneration. Method(s): This prospective study included 35 patients with one-level neurological intact thoracolumbar fracture. From January 2006 to December 2007, patients were randomized underwent posterior reduction and percutaneous pedicle fixation using two different insertion techniques. The patients were followed up postoperatively and were assessed with regard to radiological and clinical outcomes. Radiologic outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of vertebral body height, kyphotic angle and facet joint degeneration. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly with use of visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Result(s): The operation was completed successfully in 35 patients. All patients were follow-up for an average of 89 months. There were no significant differences in percutaneous pedicle fixation time and radiation dose between two insertion techniques. In the transverse processpedicle group (TG), the length of the pedicle screw were significantly longer than control group (CG). Preoperative kyphotic angle and vertebral body height were significantly improved after surgery, and these has been well maintained at the last follow-up. There was significant differences in the occurrence of facet joint degeneration more than 1 grade between two groups (TG:3 vs. CG:23). All patients had significantly improvement on VAS and ODI scores after surgery, compared with their preoperative period. In the control group, 19 patients had obvious pain in the puncture sites at 1 month postoperatively caused by facet joint violation. With local block treatment, the pain disappeared in all patients at the last follow-up. Conclusion(s): The degeneration of facet joint is closely related to the position of the pedicle screw and rod during minimally invasive surgery. Compared with traditional puncture technique, the transverse process-pedicle puncture technique can reduce the facet joint degeneration caused by pedicle screw violation and rod stress, and provide enough space for transpedicular interbody bone grafting.",Excluded,0.09044122
4668,"Outcomes of cyberknife stereotactic treatment in a small cohort of advanced unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients Background: Cyberknife stereotactic treatment is a precisely targeted radiation to a tumor while minimizing injury to adjacent normal tissue, with well-established indication in intracranial tumors. The role of cyberknife treatment in advanced unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients is still in evolution and needs more focus. Aim(s): To evaluate survival and other outcomes of cyberknife treatment in a cohort of advanced pancreatic carcinoma patients. Method(s): This is a retrospective data review of all advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients with poor prognosis who are not amenable for any kind of treatment from August 2010 to December 2012. Patients' demographics, date of diagnosis, location and size of the cancer, duration and dose of cyberknife treatment and date of death of all pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients were collected. Kaplan Meier survival curves were used to calculate the mean and median survival times for the overall cohort. The log rank test was used to compare survival by lesion size ( >=3 cm versus < 3cm). Result(s): Our cohort consisted of 17 patients with advanced unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent cyberknife treatment. Age at diagnosis ranged from 49 - 90 years with a mean of 75.2 +/- 12.9 years and eight patients (50%) were males. Tumor size ranged from 0.6 - 6.0 cm with an average size of 2.6 +/- 1.4 cm. Cyberknife treatment dose ranged from 2500 - 5400 cGy (centi Gray units) with a mean dose of 3671.8 +/- 918.0 cGy. The mean survival time for the entire cohort was 29.7 +/- 5.9 months and median survival time was 25.1 +/- 8.4 months (Figure 1), when compared to published literature of 6 - 8 months survival in advanced pancreatic carcinoma patients. Although statistically not significant, mean survival of patients with tumor size < 3cm was more than a year longer in comparison with tumor size of >= 3 cm (33.9 +/- 5.5 versus 20.4 +/- 9.5 months, p = 0.123) (Figure 2). GI bleed was observed in two patients (11.8%) and no other significant complications were noted in the rest. Conclusion(s): Results demonstrated an increase in the overall survival of advanced pancreatic carcinoma patients with cyberknife treatment when compared to published literature. This analysis was based on a small sample size and should be replicated with larger databases. (Figure presented).",Excluded,0.09338641

4671,"Quantitative Evaluation of Focused Ultrasound with a Contrast Agent on Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption The use of an ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) with focused ultrasound sonication has the potential to disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB) noninvasively and reversibly at target locations. This study investigated the effects of UCA dose and ultrasound pressure on BBB disruption. Sonications were applied at 1 MHz with a burst length of 10 ms, a 1% duty cycle and a repetition frequency of 1 Hz. The duration of the sonication was 30 s. In in vivo experiments, 16 male Wistar rats were sonicated in the presence of UCA at four doses (0, 30, 60 and 90 muL/kg). BBB integrity was evaluated by injecting Evans blue (EB) into the femoral vein of anesthetized rats. The relationship between UCA dose and the region of EB extravasation was evaluated at ultrasound pressures of 0.9 and 1.2 MPa. The BBB disruption, as quantified by the amount of EB extravasation, was significantly greater in rats injected with UCA at a dose of 60 or 90 muL/kg than at a dose of 0 or 30 muL/kg. The amount of EB extravasation increased monotonically with the quantity of UCA injected into the femoral vein before sonication. Furthermore, the BBB disruption could be enhanced in the focal region relative to the surrounding region with a higher dose of UCA (60 or 90 muL/kg). This study demonstrates that BBB disruption can be both increased and localized to the focal region by injecting an appropriate quantity of UCA before performing focused ultrasound sonications.

4672,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation in small-cell lung cancer Prophylactic cranial irradiation is now known to improve survival to a significant degree in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients; this is in addition to its established role in preventing the disabling symptoms of brain metastases. New information indicates that it confers a survival benefit for limited or extensive stage SCLC patients gaining a complete response in the chest. A review of causes of cerebral dysfunction as a complication indicates that such problems can be due to suboptimal radiation fractionation, chemotherapy, or an inappropriate combination of prophylactic brain irradiation with chemotherapy. Optimum treatment with prophylactic brain irradiation has been shown not to cause adverse effects with detailed psychometric testing. Several additional sources of information can be drawn together to suggest a dose-response pattern for prophylactic brain irradiation, leading to the recommendation that a dose of 25-36 Gy is optimal, delivered in 2-3 Gy daily fractions after the completion of chest irradiation and chemotherapy. This will be better defined in future clinical trials. [References: 32]",Excluded,0.08673915
4673,"[Clinical analysis of radiation optic neuropathy] OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features, risk factors, diagnostic methods, treatment regimens and outcomes of Chinese adult patients with radiation optic neuropathy (RON).METHODS: Retrospective case series. Clinical data with RON admitted to Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from June 1999 to October 2010 were investigated retrospectively.RESULTS: Thirty-five cases (61 eyes) with RON were analyzed. All cases manifested as sudden binocular or monocular painless vision decrease. In 18 cases (51.4%), symptoms occurred within 36 months after the completion of radiation. In 43 eyes (70.5%), the visual acuity was less than 0.05 and/or with a visual field less than 10 degrees. In 52 eyes which the fundus could be examined, 41 eyes (78.8%) showed a clear boundary of optic papilla, including 6 eyes (14.6%) with normal appearance of optic papilla, 30 eyes (73.2%) with lighter color, 5 eyes (12.2%) with pale optic papilla, and 11 eyes (21.2%) with edematous or hemorrhagic and/or exudative optic papilla. Only 14 eyes showed abnormal visual field examination, mainly manifested as nerve bundle defect scotoma. Seven eyes (50%) manifested as arcuate scotoma, 3 eyes (21.4%) manifested as central scotoma and/or paracentral scotoma, 2 eyes accompanied by blind spot enlargement, 1 eye showed paracentral scotoma and 1 eye with quadrantanopia. Twenty-three eyes received fluorescein angiography (FFA), the major manifestations were low fluorescence at the optic nerve and areas of capillary nonperfusion. Pattern visual evoked potential revealed reduced amplitude and/or extended incubation period in 83.3% eyes. Treatment regimens including systemic corticosteroids, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, hyperbaric oxygen in combination with corticosteroid and laser photocoagulation, the visual acuity of 10 eyes (16.4%) had merely been improved.CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of visual function in RON is poor resulting from devastating visual loss and/or visual field defect.

4676,"Effects of gambogic acid on the activation of caspase-3 and downregulation of SIRT1 in RPMI-8226 multiple myeloma cells via the accumulation of ROS Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most commonly diagnosed hematologic malignancy. Although new drugs, including bortezomib and lenalidomide, have improved the treatment landscape for MM patients, MM remains incurable. Therefore, screening for novel anti-myeloma drugs is necessary. Gambogic acid (GA), the main active ingredient of gamboges secreted from the Garcinia hanburryi tree, has been reported to exhibit potent anticancer activity in certain solid tumors and hematological malignancies, while there are few studies that are available concerning its effects on MM cells. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer activity of GA on the MM RPMI-8226 cells and further studied the underlying mechanisms by which GA affected the cells. RPMI-8226 cells were cultured and the effect of GA on cell proliferation was analyzed using MTT assay. Hoechst 33258 staining was used to visualize nuclear fragmentation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected. GA was found to have a significant, dose-dependent effect on growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in RPMI-8226 cells. This activity is associated with the accumulation of ROS, which contributes to the activation of caspase-3 and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), accompanied with apoptosis in RPMI-8226 cells treated with GA. Mammalian SIRT1, as the closest homolog of the yeast Sir2, was extensively involved in regulating cell processes, including cell senescence, aging and neuronal protection, as well as having anti-apoptotic properties. Moreover, SIRT1 overexpression has been shown to protect cancer cells from chemotherapy and ionizing radiation. In the present study, we demonstrated that GA has the potential to downregulate the expression of SIRT1 via ROS accumulation. In conclusion, our study found that GA is able to induce apoptosis in RPMI-8226 cells via ROS accumulation followed by caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage and SIRT1 downregulation. These results suggest that GA may have the potential to not only induce apoptosis in MM cells, but also to decrease the relapse rate of MM.",Excluded,0.08637349
4677,"PIDD Mediates Radiation-Induced Microglia Activation Radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) is the most common adverse effect that occurs after cranial radiation therapy (CRT). We have previously reported that CRT-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in brain tissues and inhibition of neurogenesis in the hippocampus might be caused by microglial activation and may play an important role in RIBI. In this study we examined the role of p53-induced protein with a death domain (PIDD) in radiation-induced activation of BV-2 cells. BV-2 cells were transfected with antisense oligonucleotide control mRNA or antisense oligonucleotide-targeted PIDD mRNA and were sham or 16 Gy irradiated. The state of microglia and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Findings from this study suggest that silencing PIDD expression could inhibit microglial activation by downregulating the PIDD-C/NF-kappabeta transcription pathway. PIDD acts as a critical switcher between the NF-kappabeta transcription pathway and radiation-induced apoptosis.

4678,"Boron neutron capture therapy of brain tumors: functional and neuropathologic effects of blood-brain barrier disruption and intracarotid injection of sodium borocaptate and boronophenylalanine Sodium borocaptate (BSH) and boronophenylalanine (BPA) are two drugs that have been used clinically for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) of brain tumors. We previously have reported that hyperosmotic mannitol-induced disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB-D), followed by intracarotid (i.c.) administration of BPA or BSH, either individually or in combination, significantly enhanced tumor boron delivery and the efficacy of BNCT in F98 glioma bearing rats. The purpose of the present study was to determine the short-term neuropathologic consequences of this treatment and the long-term effects on motor and cognitive function, as well as the neuropathologic sequelae 1 year following neutron capture irradiation. BBB-D was carried out in non-tumor bearing Fischer rats by infusing a 25% solution of mannitol i.c. followed by i.c. injection of BPA or BSH, either individually or in combination, immediately thereafter. Animals were euthanized 2 days after compound administration, and their brains were processed for neuropathologic examination, which revealed sporadic, mild, focal neuronal degeneration, hemorrhage, and necrosis. To assess the long-term effects of such treatment followed by neutron capture irradiation, non-tumor bearing rats were subjected to BBB-D after which they were injected i.c. with BPA (25 mg B/kg body weight (b.w)) or BSH (30 mg B/kg b.w.) either individually or in combination (BPA 12.5 mg and BSH 14 mg B/kg b.w.). Two and a half hours later they were irradiated at the Medical Research Reactor, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, with the same physical radiation doses (5.79, 8.10 or 10.06 Gy), delivered to the brain, as those that previously had been used for our therapy experiments. The animals tolerated this procedure well, after which they were returned to Columbus, Ohio where their clinical status was monitored weekly. After 1 year, motor function was assessed using a sensitive and reliable locomotor rating scale for open field testing in rats and cognitive function was evaluated by their performance in the Morris water maze, the results of which were similar to those obtained with age matched controls. After functional evaluation, the rats were euthanized, their brains were removed, and then processed for neuropathologic examination. Subtle histopathologic changes were seen in the choroid plexuses of irradiated animals that had received BPA, BSH or saline. Radiation related ocular changes consisting of keratitis, blepharitis, conjunctivitis and cataract formation were seen with similar frequency in most rats in each treatment group. Based on these observations, and the previously reported significant therapeutic gain associated with BBB-D and i.c. injection of BSH and BPA, the present observations establish its safety in rats and suggest that further studies in large animals and humans are warranted.",Included,0.6849423
4679,"CT-aided low-count whole-body PET imaging using cross-modality attention pyramid network Objectives: Reducing either the administered dose or scan time of PET imaging is desirable as it decreases the radiation exposure to the patient or can improve patient comfort as well as minimize motion artifact. However, the trade-off of these benefits are low overall counts and increased noise, adversely impacting image contrast and quantification. To enable low dose or shorten the PET scan while maintaining the high signal-to-noise ratio and sufficient image quality, we propose a novel method to integrate CT into a deep learning framework to aid the estimation of diagnostic quality PET images from low-count ultra-short PET scans. Method(s): We propose a cross-modality attention pyramid network (CMAPN) to generate diagnostic quality PET images from low-count PET images with the help of CT from PET/CT scans. Twenty subjects with whole-body PET/CT were used to estimate synthetic diagnostic PET images from a low-count training set using 1/8th of the normal scanning time (19 vs. 162 seconds/bed). CMAPN learns to translate a low-count PET image into a synthetic full-count PET image resembling the one from a high-quality diagnostic standard clinical protocol. At the training stage, independent 3D patch-based deep features were extracted from low-count PET and CT images using two separate PET synthesis sub-networks. The two sub-networks share the same pyramid network architecture. A low-count PET-only synthesis loss, and a CT-only synthesis loss were calculated between the outputs of the two sub-networks. The two losses would allow independent and relevant features to be extracted from low-count PET and CT images for the prediction of full-count PET images. The cross-modal deep features from the two subnetworks were subsequently combined to estimate a final full-count PET image. Feature maps of corresponding pyramid levels were first concatenated and then highlighted via attention gates. The network was trained by minimizing a combination of losses, including a low-count PET-only synthesis loss, a CT-only synthesis loss and a final synthesis loss. At the testing stage, paired low-count PET and CT image patches were first extracted from the original images. These image patch pairs were then inputted into the trained CMAPN to obtain the synthetic full-count PET patches. Finally, the synthetic full-count PET image patches were fused to predict the final whole-body full-count PET images. These synthetic PET images were then compared to the original diagnostic PET images for evaluation. The proposed method was tested using a leaveone-out cross-validation method. Mean error (ME), normalized mean square error (NMSE), normalized cross-correlation (NCC) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) were used to quantify the differences between the synthetic and the original diagnostic PET images. Result(s): The average ME, NMSE, NCC and PSNR in the whole body were 0.20+/-1.01% and 0.67+/-0.28%, 0.994+/-0.004% and 46.2+/-2.8dB for all patients. There were no significant differences between the synthetic and the original diagnostic PET images. In a volume of interest, such as the brain, lung, heart, kidneys, and liver, the overall ME was less than 2.5% and the NMSE was less than 1.5% for all patients. Lesion-based ME and NMSE were less than 5% for all patients. Conclusion(s): We have developed a novel CT-aided estimation method for synthetic full-count PET images using CMAPN. The proposed method could generate diagnostic quality PET datasets from ultra-short (1/8th count, 19 seconds/bed) PET scans. The organ boundary definition of the generated PET has improved due to the use of CT images in CMAPN. The proposed method has great potential to improve the quality of low-count PET scans for future implementation of low dose or fast scan PET imaging in the clinic.",Excluded,0.086267605

4681,"Non-linear, high-gain and sustained-to-transient signal transmission from rods to amacrine cells in dark-adapted retina of Ambystoma In darkness, On-Off amacrine cells (ACs) of the tiger salamander retina exhibited large spontaneous transient depolarizing potentials (sTDPs) with average peak amplitude of 5.05 +/- 2.5 mV and average frequency of 0.42 +/- 0.25 s(-1). Under voltage-clamp conditions the cell displayed large spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) with average peak amplitude of 98 +/- 39 pA and average frequency of 0.45 +/- 0.22 s(-1). To a light step, ACs gave rise to a transient 'On' response at the light onset and a transient 'Off' response at light offset, followed by a train of TDPs ('After' response). Near the response threshold (0.3 activated rhodopsin molecules per rod per second), light-evoked TDPs (leTDPs) of similar amplitude and kinetics as the large sTDPs observed in darkness were seen, and about half of these leTDPs elicited a regenerative potential (RP). Brighter light steps gave rise to more leTDPs and higher rates of RPs in the On, Off and After responses. Within the linear response range of the rods, the AC response was non-linear, with the highest gain (676 +/- 429) near the dark potential. The amplitude of Off responses increased with the duration of the light step, and ACs may use this to encode speeds of moving stimuli: the faster the light object moves, the smaller the AC Off response. Moreover, the number of leTDPs in the AC After response increased with light intensity, and the onset of the After response coincides with bipolar cell tail response recovery. One possible origin of the large sTDPs and leTDPs is the spontaneous and depolarization-induced regenerative calcium potentials (RCaPs) in bipolar cell synaptic terminals. RCaPs in bipolar cell synaptic terminals cause transient glutamate release that results in the sTDPs in darkness, and leTDPs in On, Off and After responses in ACs.",Excluded,0.085994616
4682,"Effects of background illumination on the horizontal cell responses in the tiger salamander retina Synaptic transmission between photoreceptors and horizontal cells (HCs) was studied in the flat-mounted isolated retinas of the tiger salamander. Background illumination expedited the rise time of the HC light response, and the HC response rise time (HCRRT) reached steady state about 2 sec after the onset of the background illumination. The change in HCRRT is probably responsible for the background-induced enhancement of the HC responses to short light stimuli. The amplitude of the HC responses to 100 msec light steps in the presence of background illumination was 2-5 times larger than that measured under dark-adapted conditions. Background illumination exerted little effect on the response rise time in cones and bipolar cells, and thus it caused no significant response enhancement in those cells. The background-induced change in HCRRT correlated closely with the rod voltage but not with the HC voltage. These results suggest that the background-induced change in HCRRT is probably mediated by postsynaptic events in HCs because no significant time course change is observed in photoreceptors and bipolar cells (which share the same synapses with the HCs). A suppressive rod action on the cone inputs in HCs may be responsible for modulating the HCRRT. By shortening the HCRRT, background illumination regulates the frequency response of the photoreceptor-HC synapse and alters the capacity of spatial resolution of retinal bipolar cells.",Excluded,0.08591803
4683,"Space cycle: a human-powered centrifuge that can be used for hypergravity resistance training INTRODUCTION: This study represents the first step toward testing the hypothesis that hypergravity can be used as a unique resistance training modality for maintaining the health and function of skeletal muscle in microgravity. The primary objectives of this study were to use a human-powered short-arm centrifuge for the following: 1) to determine whether subjects could perform squats under hypergravity conditions without developing motion sickness or illusory motion; 2) to measure foot forces while performing squats under hypergravity conditions; and 3) to determine the mechanical power required to produce 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 Gz (head to foot) at the feet.METHODS: Subjects (22 males and 19 females) performed 10 squats each at 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 Gz on a human-powered short-arm centrifuge, the space cycle. Foot forces during each squat were monitored using insole force sensors, and normalized to foot forces measured at 1 Gz (relative foot forces).RESULTS: Illusory motion was minimized using a visual focal point, and did not affect the ability of subjects to perform squats. The mean standing relative foot forces at 3.0 Gz were 2.3 and 2.4 for the male and female subjects, respectively. The work rate required to power the space cycle was a linear function of Gz, and is well within the aerobic scope of untrained individuals.DISCUSSION: The findings of this study demonstrate that hypergravity can be used as an effective modality for loading skeletal muscle and that subjects can perform squat resistance exercise without developing motion sickness or illusory motion.",Excluded,0.08593824

4685,"Energy dependence on discharge mode of Izhikevich neuron driven by external stimulus under electromagnetic induction Energy supply plays a key role in metabolism and signal transmission of biological individuals, neurons in a complex electromagnetic environment must be accompanied by the absorption and release of energy. In this paper, the discharge mode and the Hamiltonian energy are investigated within the Izhikevich neuronal model driven by external signals in the presence of electromagnetic induction. It is found that multiple electrical activity modes can be observed by changing external stimulus, and the Hamiltonian energy is more dependent on the discharge mode. In particular, there is a distinct shift and transition in the Hamiltonian energy when the discharge mode is switched quickly. Furthermore, the amplitude of periodic stimulus signal has a greater effect on the neuronal energy compared to the angular frequency, and the average Hamiltonian energy decreases when the discharge rhythm becomes higher. Based on the principle of energy minimization, the system should choose the minimum Hamiltonian energy when maintaining various trigger states to reduce the metabolic energy of signal processing in biological systems. Therefore, our results give the possible clues for predicting and selecting appropriate parameters, and help to understand the sudden and paroxysmal mechanisms of epilepsy symptoms.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the microinflammation after radiotherapy of the neck and the incidence of carotid stenosis. This study reports on patients treated with radiotherapy as part of the treatment for laryngeal cancer in the Department of Radiation Oncology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, P.R. China. Sixty-two males and nine females were treated with radiotherapy between 2006 and 3012. The carotid diameter was determined by measuring carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in the common, external and internal carotid artery. Microinflammatory conditions were assessed by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Other studied risk factors included age, treatment modalities, radiation dose and energy, the height of the radiation field, and follow-up time. Carotid stenosis was detected in all of the 71 patients. It was mainly clinically unsuspected; 19 patients had sustained a vascular event (14 TIA, 5 CVI) at a median of 3.11 years (range 2.3-5.6 years) following RT. In four of five CVI patients, CVI occurred on the side of the irradiation. Eleven patients who suffered vascular incident had severe stenosis of the carotid artery and 6 had moderate (31-49% of the lumen). Only two patients with mild stenosis on the irradiated side suffered TIAs. Serum hs-CRP levels in carotid stenosis were 9.4 (+/-SD=5.97) mg/ml, IL-6 = 12.8 (+/-SD=2.62) pg/ml and TNF-alpha = 15.4 (+/-SD=4.49) ng/ml.

[Chinese] To compare the dosimetric differences of dosiology between intensity-modulated arc radiotherapy (IMAT) and dynamic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (dIMRT) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. CT data from 25 patients treated in our radiotherapy center were selected randomly for this study. For each patient, the IMAT technique and the fixed beam dIMRT technique were accomplished by the simultaneously integrated boost. Dose volume histogram (DVH) data, isodose distribution, monitor units (MUs) and treatment time were compared in the two techniques. There was no significant difference between the IMAT and the dIMRT in dose received by 95% of target volumes (D(95)) (P>0.05). Overall, the mean dose (D(mean)), maximal dose (D(max)) and volume percentage receiving at least of 107% of the prescribed dose (V(107%)) of planning target volume (PTV) for the IMAT were increased slightly ,compared with the dlMRT (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in dosimetric indices of organs at risk (OARs) including spinal cord,optical nerves,lens and temporomandibular joints in the two techniques (P>0.05). Compared with the dlMRI, the D(max) of brain stem for the IMAT was increased slightly (P<0.05). Similar trends was observed for the D(mean) and dose received by 50% of volume (D(50)) of the left and right parotid glands (P<0.05). Healthy tissue (defined as the volume of the body minus PTV,B-P) irradiated from 800 cGy in the IMAT was higher, and that from 1200-4500 cGy was lower compared with the dlMRI (P<0.05).The average number of MUs was reduced by 62.7% per fraction, and the treatment time was on average reduced by 60.1% per fraction in the IMAT compared with the dlMRI. There is a slight difference in dosiology between the two radiotherapy techniques investigated, but they both meet the clinical requirement.

The proposed method has been demonstrated to identify functional pathways implicated in fMRI task. It can effectively follow tracts in the genu of the corpus callosum that connects to the frontal lobe cortex, obtain connections between the thalamus and the anterior insula under sensory simulation, and reconstruct optic radiations in the visual circuit under visual stimulation.

Noise is inevitable in neuronal systems and can change the electrical activities of neuron in different ways. Many previous theoretical studies about the impacts of noise on spiral waves focus an unbounded Gaussian noise and even colored noise. In this paper, the impacts of bounded noise and rewiring of network on the formation and instability of spiral waves are discussed in small-world (SW) network of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons through numerical simulations, and possible statistical analysis will be carried out. Firstly, we present SW network of HH neurons subjected to bounded noise. Then, it is numerically demonstrated that bounded noise with proper intensity sigma, amplitude A, or frequency f can facilitate the formation of spiral waves when rewiring probability p is below certain thresholds. In other words, bounded noise-induced resonant behavior can occur in the SW network of neurons. In addition, rewiring probability p always impairs spiral waves, while spiral waves are confirmed to be robust for small p, thus shortcut-induced phase transition of spiral wave with the increase of p is induced. Furthermore, statistical factors of synchronization are calculated to discern the phase transition of spatial pattern, and it is confirmed that larger factor of synchronization is approached with increasing of rewiring probability p, and the stability of spiral wave is destroyed.",Excluded,0.0857456

It is well-recognized that in addition to ionizing radiation, nearly 50% of FDA- approved chemotherapeutics cause oxidative stress in target tissues. However, the tissue origin and contents of exosomes released from chemotherapy-treated cells and their contribution to tissue injury are unknown. Here we report that in human serum, exosomes isolated from cancer patients (n = 24) exhibit a significantly higher level of 4-hydroxynonenal adducted proteins post-chemotherapy (P<0.02). In mice, systemic injection of chemotherapeutic drugs exemplified by Doxorubicin (DOX) caused a two-fold increase in circulating exosomes (DOX-EXO) compared to saline-treated controls (SAL-EXO). The authenticity of exosomes in the serum was characterized by electron microscopy and by identification of exosome markers, including Alix, CD 63, and TSG 101. Dynamic light scattering analysis showed that DOX-EXO has broader size distribution shifting to the larger size (25-200 nm) compared to SAL-EXO (10-120 nm). Proteomic analysis of mouse serum exosomes identified 329 and 275 proteins in SAL-EXO and DOX-EXO, respectively. Interestingly, proteins found in DOX-EXO serum, include glycogen phosphorylase brain, liver and muscle forms, implicate brain, liver and muscle as the source of exosomes in Dox treated animals. Proteins distinctly expressed in DOX-EXO serum also include proteins involved in DNA repair (XRCC3 and ERCC6), autophagy (TM9S1), and metabolic process (pyruvate kinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase).

Evaluation of cellular proliferation following one day after laser treatment revealed significant decrease in cell proliferation compared to control group. However on day 7, significant increase in proliferation was found in both the irradiated groups in comparison with the control group. No significant difference was found between the laser treated groups. Treatment of SCs with laser resulted in significant increase in NGF gene expression on day 20.

Previous studies have usually focused on the location of these vascular markers and did not consider the concomitant effect by Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. In this study, we aimed to find dose-dependent effects of these MRI markers on regional cortical thinning and white matter tract damage in VCI patients, considering the effect by concomitant AD pathology. Method(s): Participants consisted of 65 patients with mild cognitive impairment associated with small-vessel disease (svMCI) and 69 with subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD). Conventional brain MRI scans, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and PIB PET were performed. WMH, lacunes, microbleeds, and PIB retention amount were measured. Multiple regression analyses were used to elucidate the relationship between regional cortical thickness, DTI abnormalities, and each small vessel vascular marker, adjusting the effects by demographic factors and PIB retention amount. Result(s): Higher WMH volume was associated with cortical thinning in bilateral cingulate cortices, right insular cortex, and left lingual gyrus. More lacunes were associated with cortical thinning in the right medial and superior frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. Microbleeds were not related with regional cortical thinning. Higher PIB retention was associated with cortical thinning in left medial temporal lobe. Independent of other vascular markers and PIB retention amount, larger WMH volume was associated with decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in widespread periventricular white matter region. Regardless of PIB retention amount, more lacunes were associated with decreased FA in bilateral posterior and anterior corona radiata, right anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral posterior limb of internal capsule, and bilateral precuneus. Microbleeds had association with decreased FA in the bilateral posterior corona radiata and optic radiation. PIB retention amount was not related with regional FA decrease.

Characteristics of patients and AVM related to hemorrhagic or nonhemorrhagic presentation were evaluated by logistic regression. Risk factors predicting AVM hemorrhage during the period from the diagnosis to GKS of AVM and during the latency period after radiosurgery were evaluated using Cox regression hazards model.RESULTS: The annual hemorrhage rate before GKS was 2.0% assuming patients were at risk for hemorrhage since their birth. The hemorrhage rate calculated between the diagnosis and GKS of AVM was 6.6% and reduced to 2.5% after GKS until obliteration of the AVM. Although small and deep nidi and those with deep and single draining veins tended to present themselves with hemorrhage, only nidi with single draining veins and those ruptured before were more likely to bleed once the AVM had been diagnosed. These factors no longer predisposed the nidus to a rupture after radiosurgery and the only predicting factor for hemorrhage was a low radiosurgical prescription dose to the margin of nidus.CONCLUSIONS: The AVM hemorrhage rate seems to reduce after GKS.

METHOD(S): C6 glioma cells were implanted into the right caudate nuclei of five Wistar rats. Each rat was treated with 12 Gy of SRS using helical tomotherapy and underwent a CT perfusion scan on day 1 pre-SRS and day 5 post-SRS. Maps of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and permeability-surface area product (PS) were calculated from the CT perfusion studies. After rigid image registrations, the post-SRS CT perfusion maps were subtracted from the pre-SRS CT perfusion maps to produce CBF, CBV, and PS difference maps. Using Otsu's method, we categorized the voxels in the tumor and the peritumoral brain on the PS difference maps as regions of 1) substantial decrease, 2) modest change, and 3) substantial increase. Statistical differences in these regions and in the contralateral brain before and after SRS were tested using the paired t-test. RESULT(S): Using helical tomotherapy, 12 Gy of radiation could be delivered to the tumor, whereas the brainstem dose was < 4 Gy, and < 10% of the contralateral brain received >8 Gy. A significant decrease in PS was observed in voxels that were categorized as ""substantial decrease"" (p = 0.03), and these voxels corresponded to the tumor. We observed a marginally significant increase in PS and CBV (p = 0.07 and 0.08, respectively) in voxels of ""substantial increase,"" and these voxels corresponded to the peritumoral region. No perfusion difference (p > 0.05) was observed in the contralateral brain. CONCLUSION(S): Using CT perfusion, an acute differential vascular response to SRS was observed in the tumor and the peritumoral regions.

4701,"Altered expression of glutamate transporter GLAST mRNA in rat brain after photochemically induced focal ischemia BACKGROUND: The neurotransmitter glutamate is involved in fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain. Glutamate released from presynaptic terminals must be removed rapidly from the synaptic cleft by high affinity, sodium-dependent glutamate transporters to keep the extracellular glutamate concentration low to protect neuron from glutamate excitotoxicity, which is the major pathological mechanism of brain ischemia. GLAST is one of the identified four subtypes of the glutamate transporter system and has been suggested to play an important role in some pathological conditions. But until recently, very little information existed the concerning relationship between GLAST expression and cerebral ischemia.METHODS: Nonradioactive in situ hybridization was employed to evaluate the changes of glutamate transporter GLAST mRNA expression in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus following photochemically induced focal cortical ischemia.RESULTS: GLAST mRNA expression in cerebral pyramid cells below the infarcted area did not change at 3 h, significantly decreased at 12 h, recovered to the control level at 24 h, and significantly increased at 72 h following the ischemic lesion.

4702,"Effects of serotonergic agonists on firing rates of photically responsive cells in the hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus Serotonergic neurons from the midbrain raphe nuclei innervate the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which functions as the dominant pacemaker for mammalian circadian rhythms. We investigated the effects of serotonin (5-HT) on firing rates of light-activated SCN cells in urethane-anesthetized hamsters. Micro-iontophoretic application of 5-HT or 5-HT1A agonists (8-OH-DPAT and 5-CT) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of spontaneous activity and photic responses in the majority of SCN cells tested. Application of metergoline alone, a non-selective 5-HT antagonist, slightly increased firing rates during darkness and light exposure, suggesting a tonic serotonergic suppression of SCN activity. Metergoline also effectively attenuated suppression induced by the three 5-HT agonists. In addition, the effects of 8-OH-DPAT were blocked by a 5-HT1A antagonist, SDZ 216-525. However, other putative 5-HT antagonists were weak (propranolol and NAN-190) or ineffective (ketanserin) in blocking the action of 8-OH-DPAT. These results indicate that serotonin has a potent role in reducing photic effects on retinally activated SCN cells in hamsters, and that these effects are mediated by a receptor with properties similar to those of the 5-HT1A subtype.",Excluded,0.08587015

A comprehensive future program in ""life sciences in space"" needs, therefore, well-defined research goals and strategies as well as a sound ground-based program. The first half of this review will describe four key aspects such as the environment in space, previous accomplishments in space (primarily focusing on amphibian embryogenesis), available resources, and recent advances in bioinformatics and biotechnology, whose clear understanding is imperative for defining future directions. The second half of this review will focus on a broad range of interdisciplinary research opportunities currently supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Institute of Health (NIH), and National Science Foundation (NSF).

This is a retrospective, observational, single-center trial analyzing 77 consecutive patients with recurrent BM who were treated primarily with WBRT. All patients underwent SRS as salvage treatment. Median age was 62 years, and median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) was 80. The median interval between the starting date of WBRT and radiosurgery was 10.6 months. One, two and more than two SRS sessions were required in 42, 13 and 22 patients, respectively. The median total planning target volume (PTV) was 8.1 mL and the median dose prescribed was 20 Gy. The median follow-up was 7.7 months. 1- and 2-year neurological death-free survival (NS) rates were 87 and 78 %, respectively. Competing risk analysis demonstrated active extra-central nervous system (CNS) disease [Hazard ratio (HR) 0.236, P = 0.041] and total PTV on initial SRS (>= 5 mL) (HR 4.22, P = 0.033) to be associated with the NS rate. 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates were 41 and 11 %, respectively. The median OS time was 8.2 months. Active extra-CNS disease (HR 1.94, P = 0.034) and high KPS (>= 90) (HR 0.409, P = 0.006) were associated with the OS rate. In total, 798 tumors (75 %) in 66 patients (86 %) with sufficient radiological follow-up data were evaluated. 1- and 2-year metastasis local control rates were 76.6 and 57.9 %, respectively. Prescribed dose (>= 20 Gy) (HR 0.326, P < 0.001), tumor volume (>= 2 mL) (HR 1.98, P = 0.007) and metastases from breast cancer (HR 0.435, P < 0.001) were independent predictive factors for local tumor control.

4705,"Sensory neuron sodium current requires nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone during development Development of the embryonic nervous system requires thyroid hormone. However, the underlying mechanisms and targets of thyroid hormone action are not well defined. To identify embryonic roles for thyroid hormone we tested for effects on a key neuronal trait, voltage-gated sodium current (I(Na)), in the zebrafish model system. We recorded from Rohon-Beard sensory neurons (RBs) using whole cell voltage-clamp methods. Here, we provide in vivo evidence for thyroid hormone regulation of I(Na). Chronic thyroid hormone application increased RB peak I(Na) density 1.4-fold. However, I(Na) density showed a similar increase within 5 min of an acute hormone application, a time course not expected for a genomic mechanism. Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), a thyroid hormone blocker, blocked both chronic and acute effects. Further, the thyroid hormone precursor thyroxine (T4) affected I(Na), yet the traditionally active form triiodothyronine did not. Consequently, we tested for a nonconventional T4 receptor. LM609, a selective antagonist of integrin alphaVbeta3, occluded the rapid effect of T4, implicating a specific integrin dimer as a T4 receptor. Chronic application of either tetrac or LM609 significantly reduced sodium conductance, demonstrating an in vivo requirement for T4-integrin regulation of I(Na). Further, removing endogenous T4 levels via yolkectomy reduced sodium conductance, an effect that was partially rescued by T4 supplementation following surgery. Because RBs mediate the embryonic touch response, we tested for behavioral effects. Tetrac and LM609 significantly reduced the percentage of touch trials eliciting a normal touch response. T4's rapid effect on RB I(Na) highlights the importance of embryonic T4 availability and nongenomic T4 signaling.",Excluded,0.08629439

Of 648 adult brain tumor patients who received radiation therapy at our institute, magnetic resonance (MR) image data consisting of a gradient echo (GRE) and FLAIR T2-weighted image were available three and five years after radiation therapy in 81 patients. Intracerebral hemorrhage was defined as a hypointense dot lesion appearing on GRE images after radiation therapy. The number and size of the lesions were evaluated. The T2 hyperintense WMLs observed on the FLAIR sequences were graded according to the extent of the lesion. Intracerebral hemorrhage was detected in 21 (25.9%) and 35 (43.2) patients in the three- and five-year follow-up images, respectively. The number of intracerebral hemorrhages per patient tended to increase as the follow-up period increased, whereas the size of the intracerebral hemorrhages exhibited little variation over the course of follow-up. T2 hyperintense WMLs were observed in 27 (33.3%) and 32 (39.5) patients in the three and five year follow-up images, respectively. The age at the time of radiation therapy was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the patients with T2 hyperintense WMLs than in those without lesions. Intracerebral hemorrhages are not uncommon in adult brain tumor patients undergoing radiation therapy. The incidence and number of intracerebral hemorrhages increased over the course of follow-up.

4707,"Comparison of radiosensitizing effects of several PARP inhibitors under clinical investigation Targeting tumor DNA repair is an attractive strategy in selectively killing tumors while sparing normal tissues. Inhibiting Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in cancers with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations has been shown to be a promising approach either as a single agent or in combination therapy with chemotherapeutics or ionizing radiation. To systematically compare the radiosensitizing efficacy of various PARP inhibitors we have evaluated the long-term cytotoxicity of ABT-888, AZD2281, MK4827, and BSI-201 in clonogenic survival assays in combination with ionizing radiation. For these studies we used the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB 231 BR, a subline of MDA-MB-231 selected for its tendency to metastasize to brain (BRCA1+/-) and MX-1 (BRCA1 deletion and BRCA2 mutation). Furthermore, we have evaluated PARP inhibitors under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (21% O2 versus 0.1% O2). In MDA-MB 231 BR cells, at a clinically relevant and achievable concentration for ABT-888 (J Clin Oncol. 2009; 27(16)) and AZD2281(N Engl J Med. 2009; 361(2)), and at 1 uM MK4827 showed radiosensitizing effects under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. BSI-201 at a clinically achievable concentration (ASCO 2010, Abstract 2012) did not exhibit radiosensitizing effects under the same conditions. When MX-1 cells were treated with BSI-201 under hypoxic conditions (0.1% O2) the cytotoxicity of BSI-201 was evident. Taken together, the results show that ABT-888, AZD2281 and MK4827 show promising radiosensitizing effects under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions whereas the cytotoxicity of BSI-201 was observed only under hypoxic conditions in BRCA1/2 mutant carrier MX-1cells.",Excluded,0.08624673
4708,"Differentiation of Recurrent Glioblastoma from Delayed Radiation Necrosis by Using Voxel-based Multiparametric Analysis of MR Imaging Data Purpose To assess a volume-weighted voxel-based multiparametric (MP) clustering method as an imaging biomarker to differentiate recurrent glioblastoma from delayed radiation necrosis. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the informed consent requirement. Seventy-five patients with pathologic analysis-confirmed recurrent glioblastoma (n = 42) or radiation necrosis (n = 33) who presented with enlarged contrast material-enhanced lesions at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging after they completed concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy were enrolled. The diagnostic performance of the total MP cluster score was determined by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with cross-validation and compared with those of single parameter measurements (10% histogram cutoffs of apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC10] or 90% histogram cutoffs of normalized cerebral blood volume and initial time-signal intensity AUC). Results Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that an AUC for differentiating recurrent glioblastoma from delayed radiation necrosis was highest in the total MP cluster score and lowest for ADC10 for both readers. The total MP cluster score had significantly better diagnostic accuracy than any single parameter (corrected P = .001-.039 for reader 1; corrected P = .005-.041 for reader 2). The total MP cluster score was the best predictor of recurrent glioblastoma (cross-validated AUCs, 0.942-0.946 for both readers), with a sensitivity of 95.2% for reader 1 and 97.6% for reader 2.

4709,"Development of a multipurpose, flexible and scalable data acquisition system for DOI-PET Objectives Depth-of-interaction (DOI) measurement, which reduces the parallax error, is desirable not only for reducing resolution loss at the peripheral region but also for enabling unusual, dedicated detectorarrangement in PET. However practical use of DOI detectors has not been achieved in clinical scanners. In this paper, therefore, we develop a multipurpose, flexible and scalable DOI detector system, and it is used to develop two world's first PET scanners, the OpenPET and the helmet-chin PET. OpenPET, which consists of two axially separated detector rings, is originally proposed for in situ visualization of irradiation field in particle therapy. On the other hand, the helmet-chin PET, in which additional ""chin strap"" detectors assist a hemisphere detector unit, is proposed as the most efficient geometry for brain imaging. Methods For both scanners, the DOI detectors consist of 1024 Zr-doped GSO crystals which are arranged in 4 layers of 16 x 16 arrays, coupled to a 64-ch flat panel PMT. Each crystal element is 2.8 x 2.8 x 7.5 mm<sup>3</sup>. Front-end circuit equipped only resister chain and amplifier and the data acquisition (DAQ) system was separated from the gantry by 15-m coaxial cables for protecting electronics circuits from radiation damage by secondary particles. Also, the DAQ system has no coincidence circuit and only the singles list-mode DAQ circuits. Singles data are multiplexed and stored in a single PC through the optical cable. The assumed maximum data transfer rate of this DAQ system is 100 Mcps. The DAQ system makes a judgment on coincidence based on software. Results For the whole-body OpenPET, count rate performance was measured by the cylinder phantom. This phantom activity was 257 MBq. Measurement time was 60 s at 20 min intervals. Singles data loss was under 8%. Also, calculation time of the coincidence process was less than the measurement time less than 250 MBq.

However, the mechanism of uptake by the tumor remains unclear. We investigated the sulfhydryl moiety of this compound. Down regulation of glutathione (GSH) by buthionine sulfoximine in cultured cells resulted in increase of BSH uptake (7.9-36.5%) compared to the control group and consequently the cytocidal effect of neutron irradiation also increased. On the other hand, the radiation caused damage by gamma-ray irradiation was suppressed when BSH uptake increased.

Their in vitro proliferation rates and the class I expression of major histocompatibility complex were not different from those of wild-type cells. Five-Gy irradiation of the respective cytokine producers slightly reduced the in vitro cell growth but treatment with 15 Gy significantly impaired the proliferation. In contrast, the secretion of both cytokines from the respective transduced cells was retained compared with the cell growth. We immunized syngeneic mice with irradiated wild-type cells as a control or cytokine-producing cells and challenged the mice with unirradiated wild-type cells. The control mice developed tumors of the challenged wild-type cells, on the contrary, the mice which had received irradiated IL-2 or GM-CSF producers did not.

4712,"Cell-type specific modulation of intrinsic firing properties and subthreshold membrane oscillations by the M(Kv7)-current in neurons of the entorhinal cortex The M-current (current through Kv7 channels) is a low-threshold noninactivating potassium current that is suppressed by muscarinic agonists. Recent studies have shown its role in spike burst generation and intrinsic subthreshold theta resonance, both of which are important for memory function. However, little is known about its role in principal cells of the entorhinal cortex (EC). In this study, using whole cell patch recording techniques in a rat EC slice preparation, we have examined the effects of the M-current blockers linopirdine and XE991 on the membrane dynamics of principal cells in the EC. When the M-current was blocked, layer II nonstellate cells (non-SCs) and layer III cells switched from tonic discharge to intermittent firing mode, during which layer II non-SCs showed high-frequency short-duration spike bursts due to increased fast spike afterdepolarization (ADP). When three spikes were elicited at 50 Hz, these two types of cells reacted with a slow ADP that drove delayed firing. In contrast, layer II stellate cells (SCs) and layer V cells never displayed intermittent firing, bursting behavior, or delayed firing. Under the M-current block, intrinsic excitability increased significantly in layer III and layer V cells but not in layer II SCs and non-SCs. The M-current block also had contrasting effects on the subthreshold excitability, greatly suppressing the subthreshold membrane potential oscillations in layer V cells but not in layer II SCs. Modulation of the M-current thus shifts the firing behavior, intrinsic excitability, and subthreshold membrane potential oscillations of EC principal cells in a cell-type-dependent manner.",Excluded,0.08579401

Wortmannin inhibited DNA-PK and ATM activities. Cells were synchronized by hydroxyurea. Progression through the cell cycle was analysed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: M059J exhibited hyper-radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle, with extreme hyper-radiosensitivity in G to early S-phase compared with the control cell line M059K. AT3BISV and AT5BIVA exhibited hyper-radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle but showed a similar pattern of cell-cycle-dependent radiosensitivity to that observed in LM217 or HeLa cells. In AT3BISV and AT5BIVA, radiosensitization by wortmannin was observed throughout the cell cycle and was most prominent in G1 to early S-phase. Wortmannin did not sensitize M059J to ionizing radiation in any cell-cycle phase. DNA-PK activities were not different throughout the cell cycle.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that (1) non-homologous endjoining plays a dominant role in G1 to early S-phase and a minor role in late S to G2-phase in repairing DNA double-strand breaks, (2) the role of ATM in repairing double-strand breaks may be almost cell-cycle-independent and (3) the dominant role of non-homologous end-joining during G1 to early S-phase is not due to cell-cycle-dependent fluctuations in DNA-PK activity.",Excluded,0.09188102

The dose range of X-irradiation was from 1,300 to 2,500 rads, i.e., 1,300, 1,500, 1,750, 2,000, and 2,500 rads. Eighty-six mice were used for histological examination.

Necrosis (encephalomalacia), atrophy, cell infiltration, and telangiectatic vascular change of the brain, caused as a result of the fibrinoid necrosis of the large arteries, were observed. Dose-dependent incidence of the fibrinoid necrosis increased between 41 and 87 weeks after irradiation. Mean score of fibrinoid necrosis increased dose dependently approximately 60 weeks after irradiation. It is suggested that scores of large vessel damage do relate to dose at 41 to 87 weeks, and can be used to quantify the vessel injury, and that fibrinoid necrosis of the large vessels may relate to the incidence of radionecrosis.",Included,0.9842545

Studies on this animal have suggested that the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) is an important centre controlling photoperiodic time measurement. Here we report that expression in the MBH of the gene encoding type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2), which catalyses the intracellular deiodination of thyroxine (T4) prohormone to the active 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), is induced by light in Japanese quail.

We identified 24 consecutive multiple-target cases (3 to 19 targets in each case) with 189 total targets. We constructed plans using both 4- and 6-arc noncoplanar VMA-SRT. The prescribed dose was 36 Gy/6 fr, and it was delivered to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV). The plans were evaluated for the dose conformity using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and Paddick conformity indices (RCI and PCI), fall-off (Paddick gradient index [PGI]), and the normal brain dose. The median (range) RCI, PCI, and PGI was 0.94 (0.92 to 0.99), 0.89 (0.77 to 0.94), and 3.75 (2.24 to 6.54) for the 4-arc plan and 0.94 (0.91 to 0.98), 0.89 (0.76 to 0.94), and 3.65 (2.24 to 6.5) for the 6-arc plan, respectively. The median (range) of the normal brain dose was 910.3 cGy (381.4 to 1268.9) for the 4-arc plan and 898.8 cGy (377 to 1252.9) for the 6-arc plan. The PGI of the 6-arc plan was significantly superior to that of the 4-arc plan (p = 0.0076), and the optimal cutoff values for the tumor number and volume indicative of 6-arc (and not 4-arc) VMA-SRT were cases with >= 5 metastases and a PTV of >= 12.9 mL, respectively.

4720,"Nuclear Import Receptor Inhibits Phase Separation of FUS through Binding to Multiple Sites Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is believed to underlie formation of biomolecular condensates, cellular compartments that concentrate macromolecules without surrounding membranes. Physical mechanisms that control condensate formation/dissolution are poorly understood. The RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) undergoes LLPS in vitro and associates with condensates in cells. We show that the importin karyopherin-beta2/transportin-1 inhibits LLPS of FUS. This activity depends on tight binding of karyopherin-beta2 to the C-terminal proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) of FUS. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses reveal weak interactions of karyopherin-beta2 with sequence elements and structural domains distributed throughout the entirety of FUS. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that most of these same regions also contribute to LLPS of FUS. The data lead to a model where high-affinity binding of karyopherin-beta2 to the FUS PY-NLS tethers the proteins together, allowing multiple, distributed weak intermolecular contacts to disrupt FUS self-association, blocking LLPS.

For most patients, the index CT scan was the only one received over an 11-year period. However, 28.4% of patients received 1 or more CT brain scans during the preceding decade and 6.7% received 1 or more CT brain scans during the subsequent year. Of the 473 patients (75.9%) whose index scan was ordered by a primary care physician, most (80.3%) did not see a specialist during follow-up. One patient with an indeterminate finding on the index scan was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor (0.2%), and 6 patients (1.0%) died during follow-up. Among the 4 deaths in which the cause could be determined, none were due to central nervous system causes.CONCLUSION: because of the potential risk of cancer from exposure to ionizing radiation, efforts should be made to avoid CT scanning for headache when the likelihood of serious illness is low.

The method models the average discharge rate of fibers for steady stimuli and is based on responses to approximately 100 noise-like stimuli with pseudorandom spectral levels in 1/8- or 1/16-octave frequency bins. The model assumes that rate is determined by a linear weighting of the spectrum plus a second-order weighting of all pairs of spectrum values within a certain frequency range of best frequency. The method allows prediction of rate responses to stimuli with arbitrary wideband spectral shapes, thus providing a direct test of the degree of linearity of spectral processing Auditory-nerve fibers are shown to rely mainly on linear weighting of the stimulus spectrum; however, significant second-order terms are present and are important in predicting responses to random-spectrum shape stimuli, although not for predicting responses to noise filtered with cat head-related transfer functions. The second-order terms weight the products of levels at identical frequencies positively and the products of different frequencies negatively. As such, they model both curvature in the rate versus level function and suppressive interactions between different frequency components. The first- and second-order characterizations derived in this method provide a measure of higher-order nonlinearities in neurons, albeit without providing information about temporal characteristics.",Excluded,0.08583871
4725,"Alterations in uptake and release rates for GABA, glutamate, and glutamine during biochemical maturation of highly purified cultures of cerebral cortical neurons, a GABAergic preparation This study demonstrates that virtually homogenous cultures of mouse cerebral neurons, obtained from 15-day-old embryos, differentiate at least as well as cultures which in addition contain astrocytes. This was indicated by glutamate decarboxylase activity which within 2 weeks rose from a negligible value to twice the level in the adult mouse cerebral cortex, and by a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake rate which quadrupled during the second week in culture and reached higher values than in brain slices. Within the same period, the GABA content increased four to five times to 75 nmol/mg protein, and a potassium-induced increase in [<sup>14</sup>C]GABA efflux became apparent. Although the development was faster than in vivo, optimum differentiation required maintenance of the cultures beyong the age of 1 week. Uptake and release rates for glutamate and glutamine underwent much less developmental alteration. At no time was there any potassium-induced release of radioactivity after exposure to [<sup>14</sup>C]glutamate, and the glutamate uptake was only slightly increased during the period of GABAergic development. This indicates that exogenous glutamate is not an important GABA precursor. Similarly, glutamine uptake was unaltered between days 7 and 14, although a small potassium-induced release of radioactivity after loading with glutamine suggests a partial conversion to GABA.",Excluded,0.088486336
4726,"The lateral abdominal island flap--the lateral intercostal neurovascular island flap. [Chinese] This work studied the lateral abdominal island flap, its clinical value, transposition range and the practicability of a modified operative method. Five lateral abdominal island flaps were used in 5 patients. Four of them were for axillary radiation ulcers after radical mastectomy. One was for a sacral defect after resection of a recurrent fibrosarcoma. All the flaps obtained satisfactory results. Clinical applications revealed that the blood supply of the lateral abdominal skin was mainly from the lateral cutaneous branches of the 9th, 10th and 11th intercostal arteries, among which there were numerous anastomoses. The lateral abdominal island flap can be pedicled with any of these lateral cutaneous branches. The long pedicle of the flap provides a wide range of trnasposition from the axilla to the sacrum. As the pedicle of the flap contains the lateral cutaneous branch of the intercostal nerve, the flap can bring sensation function to the recipient area.

4727,"Serine/threonine kinase BUB1 promotes proliferation and radio-resistance in glioblastoma BUB1 (Budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1), a mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase, has been linked in numerous cancers to pro-tumorigenic phenomena including elevation of cellular proliferation, tumor growth, metastatic potential, and poorer patient prognosis. However, the role of BUB1 in glioblastoma remains poorly investigated. In this study, clinical analyses determined significant enrichment of BUB1 in glioblastoma with direct correlation of elevated expression to poorer prognosis in glioma patients. Genetic inhibition of BUB1 in glioblastoma tumor cells via shRNA silencing diminished both proliferative ability and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of BUB1 was additionally determined to promote the cytotoxic effect of irradiation on glioblastoma tumor cells, and investigation of the underlying pathways revealed the roles of DNA mismatch repair, spliceosome and c-Myc pathways. Mechanistically, FOXM1 was determined to positively regulate transcription of BUB1 via direct promoter region binding. For validation, pharmacologic inhibition through administration of a BUB1 inhibitor demonstrated attenuated glioblastoma cellular proliferation in vitro as well as delayed tumor growth with prolonged survival in vivo. Collectively, this study demonstrates a novel therapeutic target for glioblastoma in the form of BUB1, which plays a pivotal role in GBM proliferative and radio-resistance capacities in a FOXM1-dependant manner.",Excluded,0.08664517
4728,"Changes of microstructural white matter in vascular cognitive disorder and amnestic mild cognitive impairment: A diffusion tensor imaging study Background: White matter (WM) damage could be observed in both vascular cognitive disorder predementia (VCD-P) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). In the period of VCD-P, the degree of cognitive decline was similar to aMCI, but they are different in the specific cognitive domains. However whether the differences in cognitive domains are related to the pattern of WM impairment hasn't been illustrated. Hypothesized: The region or degree of WM impairment differs from VCD-P to aMCI. Method(s): All subjects include 28 patients with VCD-P, 34 aMCI and 39 normal controls (NC) underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and DTI. We compared fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AxD) of whole brain WM regions. Then the diffusion tensor was reconstructed, analyzed by tract-based spatial statistics. Result(s): Patient groups exhibited significant differences in FA, MD and AxD, the VCD-P group has a lower FA, higher MD and AxD. The different FA and MD region between VCD-P and aMCI was in left anterior limb of internal capsule, bilateral corona radiata, corpus callosum, cerebral peduncle, external capsule, posterior limb of internal capsule, fornix, inferior longitidinal fasciculus, inferior and superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, whereas in AxD it was showed in bilateral corona radiata, internal capsule, external capsule, corpus callosum, posterior thalamic radiation and superior longitudinal fasciculus. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that VCD-P and aMCI have divergent topography of WM microstructural changes in the degree and the region, the WM integrity was impaired more severe in VCD-P. The differences in regions may illustrate the clinical and neuropsychological features characterized by executive or memory deficit.

The combined low-dose rate (LDR) (0.03 Gy/h) and fractionated high-dose rate (HDR) treatments result in cures of experimental MGs. To enhance efficacy, we combined polymeric IUdR delivery, LDR, and HDR for treatments of both subcutaneous and intracranial MGs. In vitro: Cells (U251 MG) were trypsinized and replated in triplicate 1 day prior to LDR irradiation in media either without (control) or with 10 microM IUdR. After 72 hr, LDR irradiation cells were acutely irradiated (1.1 Gy/min) with increasing (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, or 10 Gy) single doses. Implantable IUdR polymers [(poly(bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)-propane) (PCPP): sebaic acid (PCPP:SA), 20:80] (50% loading; 10 mg) were synthesized. In vivo: For flank vs. intracranial tumors, mice had 6 x 10(6) subcutaneous vs. 2 x 10(5) intracranial cells. For intracranial or subcutaneous MGs, mice had intratumoral blank (empty) vs. IUdR polymer treatments. One day after implantation, mice had immediate external LDR (3 cGy/h x 3 days total body irradiation) or HDR (2 Gy BID x 4 days to tumor site) or concurrent treatments. For the in vitro IUdR treatments, LDR resulted in a striking increase in cell-killing when combined with HDR. For the in vivo LDR treatments of flank tumors, the growth delay was greater for the IUdR vs. blank polymer treatments. For the combined LDR and HDR, the IUdR treatments resulted in a dramatic decrease in tumor volumes. On day 60 the log V/V0 were -1.7 +/- 0.22 for combined LDR + HDR + IUdR polymer (P < 0.05 vs. combined LDR + HDR + blank polymer). Survival for the intracranial controls was 22.9 +/- 1.2 days. For the blank polymer + LDR vs. blank polymer + LDR + HDR treatments, survival was 25.3 +/- 1.7 (P = NS) vs. 48.1 +/- 3.5 days (P < 0.05). For IUdR polymer + LDR treatment survival was 27.3 +/- 2.3 days (P = NS). The most striking improvement in survival followed the IUdR polymer + LDR + HDR treatment: 66.0 + 6.4 days (P < 0.05 vs. blank polymer + LDR + HDR).

4730,"TGFbeta1 Polymorphisms Predict Distant Metastasis-Free Survival in Patients with Inoperable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer after Definitive Radiotherapy Purpose:Transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta1 signaling is involved in cancer-cell metastasis. We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at TGFbeta1 were associated with overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy. Method(s):We genotyped TGFbeta1 SNPs at rs1800469 (C-509T), rs1800471 (G915C), and rs1982073 (T+29C) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in blood samples from 205 NSCLC patients who had had definitive radiotherapy at one institution in November 1998-January 2005. We also tested whether the TGF-beta1 rs1982073 (T+29C) SNP affected the migration and invasion of A549 and PC9 lung cancer cells. Result(s):Median follow-up time for all patients was 17 months (range, 1-97 months; 39 months for patients alive at the time of analysis). Multivariate analysis showed that the TGFbeta1 rs1800469 CT/CC genotype was associated with poor OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.463 [95% confidence interval {CI} = 1.012-2.114], P = 0.043) and shorter DMFS (HR = 1.601 [95% CI = 1.042-2.459], P = 0.032) and that the TGFbeta1 rs1982073 CT/CC genotype predicted poor DMFS (HR = 1.589 [95% CI = 1.009-2.502], P = 0.046) and poor brain MFS (HR = 2.567 [95% CI = 1.155-5.702], P = 0.021) after adjustment for age, sex, race, performance status, smoking status, tumor histology and volume, stage, receipt of concurrent radiochemotherapy, number of chemotherapy cycles, and radiation dose. Transfection with TGFbeta1+29C (vs. +29T) stimulated the migration and invasion of A549 and PC9 cells, suggesting that TGFbeta1+29C may be linked with increased metastatic potential. Conclusion(s):TGFbeta1 genotypes at rs1800469 and rs1982073 could be useful for predicting DMFS among patients with NSCLC treated with definitive radiation therapy.

4731,"Treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations with high-flow arteriovenous fistulas: risk and complications associated with endovascular embolization in multimodality treatment. Clinical article OBJECT: High-flow fistulas associated with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) pose a significant challenge to both stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and surgical treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes of multimodality treatment of AVMs in association with a large arteriovenous fistula (AVF), with a special focus on endovascular embolization and its associated complications.METHODS: One hundred ninety-two patients harboring cerebral AVMs underwent endovascular treatment in the authors' department between 1997 and 2003. Of these, the authors selected 74 patients presenting with an AVM associated with high-flow AVF(s) for a retrospective analysis based on the findings of superselective angiography. After endovascular embolization, 32 patients underwent resection, 33 underwent either SRS or hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT), and 3 underwent both surgery and SRS. Six patients underwent embolization only. Immediate and midterm treatment outcomes were analyzed.RESULTS: Fifty-seven (77%) of the 74 patients had AVMs that were Spetzler-Martin Grade III or higher. A complete resection was achieved in all 32 patients. Of patients who underwent SRS/HSRT, 13 patients (39.3%) had either complete or > 90% obliteration of the AVM, and 2 patients (6.1%) had incomplete obliteration. Fourteen patients (42.4%) with residual AVM underwent repeated radiotherapy (and remain under observation). Of the 3 patients who underwent both SRS and resection, resection was complete in 2 and incomplete in one. No follow-up was obtained in 6 patients (8.1%). An endovascular complication was observed in 4 patients (5.4%). Fistula embolization was safely performed in every patient, whereas every endovascular complication was associated with other procedures such as nidus embolization.CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular occlusion of the fistulous component was successfully achieved in every patient; every endovascular complication in this series was related to other procedures such as nidus embolization. The importance of the fistula treatment should be emphasized to minimize the endovascular complications and to maximize the treatment effect when a multimodality therapy is used to treat brain AVMs with large AVF.",Excluded,0.090597905

Little is known regarding prognostic features, clinical characteristics or the impact of treatment on patient (pt) outcomes. Method(s): In this IRB approved retrospective study, our neuro-oncology longitudinal database was screened for pts with GG from 1992-2012. 67 adult pts (age>18) were identified. Result(s): 60 pts presented with low grade GG and 7 with anaplastic GG. The median age at diagnosis was 27 years (18-59). 22 pts developed recurrent disease (18 low grade and 4 high grade) with a median time to recurrence of 87 weeks from surgery. 7 of the pts with low grade GG had malignant transformation to a malignant tumor (anaplastic GG or GBM). 22 pts received radiation therapy, 16 at diagnosis. 14 pts received chemotherapy at recurrence. Pts with incomplete resections or higher grade tumors were more likely to receive chemotherapy or radiation. The median overall survival (OS) time for these pts was not reached with a median follow-up time of 4.6 years. The 2-, 5- and 10-year OS were 98%, 87%, and 76%. Factors on univariate analysis that were significantly associated with OS were KPS at presentation (HR 10.1; 95% CI 2.6, 39.1; p = 0.0008), extent of resection (EOR) (biopsy vs gross total; HR 12.1; 95% CI 2.3, 63.6; p = 0.003), histologic grade (Grade 1-2 vs Grade 3-4; HR 0.06; 95% CI 0.01, 0.3; p = 0.0002), and seizure control following surgery (Engel I vs Engel 2-3; HR 0.1; 95% CI 0.01, 0.9; p = 0.02).

Methods and materials Twenty-two patients with chemodectomas of the skull base were treated with FSRT at our institution. Ten patients received primary RT, and 12 patients were treated for recurrent or progressive disease after primary surgery (8 patients) or embolization (4 patients). The median total dose was 57.6 Gy, with a median of 1.8 Gy/fraction. The median target volume was 71.8 cm<sup>3</sup> (range, 10.5-212.2 cm <sup>3</sup>). The most common symptoms at the initial diagnosis were pulsatile tinnitus (16 patients), hearing loss (14 patients), and balance disturbance (14 patients). Twelve patients had additional cranial nerve deficits. Results The median follow-up was 5.7 years (range, 19-177 months). The actuarial overall survival rate was 89.5% at 5 and 10 years. The actuarial local control rate was 90.4% at 5 and 10 years. Seven patients (32%) had a partial response and 13 (59%) had stable disease of the irradiated chemodectoma. Two symptomatic patients developed recurrence after 19 and 32 months. Neurologic dysfunction improved or completely resolved in 59% and stabilized in 32%; 9% of patients experienced impairment of preexisting neurologic dysfunction. No patient developed new neurologic deficits after FSRT. RT was interrupted in 1 patient because of a maxillary bone abscess.

The etiology of SANS is not well understood but is thought to involve changes in cerebrovascular flow dynamics in response to microgravity. There is a paucity of knowledge in this area; in particular, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics have not been well characterized under microgravity conditions. Our study was designed to determine the effect of simulated microgravity (head-down tilt [HDT]) on cerebrovascular flow dynamics. We hypothesized that microgravity conditions simulated by acute HDT would result in increases in CSF pulsatile flow.METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, we measured flow in major cerebral arteries, veins, and CSF spaces in fifteen healthy volunteers using phase contrast magnetic resonance (PCMR) before and during 15degree HDT.RESULTS: We found a decrease in all CSF flow variables [systolic peak flow (p = 0.009), and peak-to-peak pulse amplitude (p = 0.001)]. Cerebral arterial average flow (p = 0.04), systolic peak flow (p = 0.04), and peak-to-peak pulse amplitude (p = 0.02) all also significantly decreased. We additionally found a decrease in average cerebral arterial flow (p = 0.040). Finally, a significant increase in cerebral venous cross-sectional area under HDT (p = 0.005) was also observed.CONCLUSIONS: These results collectively demonstrate that acute application of -15degree HDT caused a reduction in CSF flow variables (systolic peak flow and peak-to-peak pulse amplitude) which, when coupled with a decrease in average cerebral arterial flow, systolic peak flow, and peak-to-peak pulse amplitude, is consistent with a decrease in cardiac-related pulsatile CSF flow. These results suggest that decreases in cerebral arterial inflow were the principal drivers of decreases in CSF pulsatile flow.",Excluded,0.09604373
4739,"Magnetic resonance imaging-guided attenuation and scatter corrections in three-dimensional brain positron emission tomography Reliable attenuation correction represents an essential component of the long chain of modules required for the reconstruction of artifact-free, quantitative brain positron emission tomography (PET) images. In this work we demonstrate the proof of principle of segmented magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided attenuation and scatter corrections in three-dimensional (3D) brain PET. We have developed a method for attenuation correction based on registered T1-weighted MRI, eliminating the need of an additional transmission (TX) scan. The MR images were realigned to preliminary reconstructions of PET data using an automatic algorithm and then segmented by means of a fuzzy clustering technique which identifies tissues of significantly different density and composition. The voxels belonging to different regions were classified into air, skull, brain tissue and nasal sinuses. These voxels were then assigned theoretical tissue-dependent attenuation coefficients as reported in the ICRU 44 report followed by Gaussian smoothing and addition of a good statistics bed image. The MRI-derived attenuation map was then forward projected to generate attenuation correction factors (ACFs) to be used for correcting the emission (EM) data. The method was evaluated and validated on 10 patient data where TX and MRI brain images were available. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of differences between TX-guided and segmented MRI-guided 3D reconstructions were performed by visual assessment and by estimating parameters of clinical interest. The results indicated a small but noticeable improvement in image quality as a consequence of the reduction of noise propagation from TX into EM data. Considering the difficulties associated with preinjection TX-based attenuation correction and the limitations of current calculated attenuation correction, MRI-based attenuation correction in 3D brain PET would likely be the method of choice for the foreseeable future as a second best approach in a busy nuclear medicine center and could be applied to other functional brain imaging modalities such as SPECT.",Excluded,0.08552073

Given concerns regarding excess radiation exposure and financial burden, our aim was to develop a prognostic score for disease recurrence to guide individually tailored surveillance strategies.METHODS: All patients with primary nonfunctioning, nonmetastatic well/moderately differentiated PanNETs who underwent curative-intent resection at 9-institutions from 2000 to 2016 were included (n = 1006). A Recurrence Risk Score (RRS) was developed from a randomly selected derivation cohort comprised of 67% of patients and verified on the validation-cohort comprised of the remaining 33%.RESULTS: On multivariable analysis, patients within the derivation cohort (n = 681) with symptomatic tumors (jaundice, pain, bleeding), tumors >2 cm, Ki67 >3%, and lymph node (LN) (+) disease had increased recurrence. Each factor was assigned a score based on their weighted odds ratio that formed a RRS of 0 to 10: symptomatic = 1, tumor >2 cm = 2, Ki67 3% to 20% = 1, Ki67 >20% = 6, LN (+) = 1. Patients were grouped into low- (RRS = 0-2; n = 247), intermediate-(RRS = 3-5; n = 204), or high (RRS = 6-10; n = 9)-risk groups. At 24 months, 33% of high RRS recurred, whereas only 2% of low and 14% of intermediate RRS recurred. This persisted in the validation cohort (n = 325).CONCLUSIONS: This international, novel, internally validated RRS accurately stratifies recurrence-free survival for patients with resected PanNETs.

The purpose of this study was to develop methods for the production of high levels of (211)At and the radiosynthesis of clinically useful amounts of (211)At-labeled human/mouse chimeric 81C6 antibody.METHODS: (211)At was produced through the (209)Bi(alpha, 2n)(211)At reaction using an internal target system and purified by a dry distillation process. Antibody labeling was accomplished by first synthesizing N-succinimidyl 3-[(211)At]astatobenzoate from the corresponding tri-n-butyl tin precursor and reacting it with the antibody in pH 8.5 borate buffer. Quality control procedures consisted of methanol precipitation, size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and pyrogen and sterility assays, as well as determination of the immunoreactive fraction by a rapid procedure using a recombinant tenascin fragment coupled to magnetic beads.RESULTS: A total of 16 antibody labeling runs were performed. Using beam currents of 50-60 microA alpha-particles and irradiation times of 1.5-4.5 h, the mean (211)At production yield was 27.75 +/- 2.59 MBq/microA.h, and the maximum level of (211)At produced was 6.59 GBq after a 4-h irradiation at 55 microA. The decay-corrected distillation yield was 67% +/- 16%. The yield for the coupling of the (211)At-labeled active ester to the antibody was 76% +/- 8%. The fraction of (211)At activity that eluted with a retention time corresponding to intact IgG on HPLC was 96.0% +/- 2.5%. All preparations had a pyrogen level of <0.125 EU/mL and were determined to be sterile. The mean immunoreactive fraction for these 16 preparations was 83.3% +/- 5.3%. Radiolysis did not interfere with labeling chemistry or the quality of the labeled antibody product.CONCLUSION: These results show that it is feasible to produce clinically relevant activities of (211)At-labeled antibodies and have permitted the initiation of a phase I trial of (211)At-labeled chimeric 81C6 administered directly into the tumor resection cavities of brain tumor patients.",Excluded,0.08597231

[Russian] Behavior of a group of rats was observed visually and tape recorded continuously from day 19 till the end of 25-d hypomagnetic experiments. Results were statistically processed with the help of Statistica 6.0, time series spectral analysis, and cosinor analysis. The 25-d HM exposure was shown to suppress food-motivated behavior in the mornings on the background of step-up in serotoninergic processes in the brain, and exaggerate the intraspecific violent conduct at night.

4745,"White matter and cortical degeneration in progressive supranuclear palsy Background and aims: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) represents an atypical parkinsonism characterized by motor and cognitive alterations, whose differential clinical diagnosis with idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (PD) may be challenging. We aimed to evaluate white matter (WM) and cortical alterations in PSP patients compared to PD by using Tracts Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and Cortical thickness analysis. Method(s): 21 PSP (mean age+/-SD: 73.6+/-6.8 y; 10 males) and 20 PD patients (62.9+/-8.7 y; 16 males) underwent a standardized MR protocol including high resolution 3D T1-weighted FSPGR, and 25-direction diffusion tensor images (DTI) on a1.5 T scanner. We applied TBSS to obtain voxelwise estimates of tensor parameters: mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), axial, (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). Cortical thickness evaluation was performed with Freesurfer software. Diffusion parameters and average cortical thickness within targeted regions of interest were compared between groups. Result(s): TBSS showed a widespread FA reduction and a MD, AD and RD increase in the PSP group, involving supra- and infra-tentorial WM (corrected p < 0.001), in particular in the corticospinal tracts, corpus callosum, corona radiata, anterior thalamic radiations, cerebellar peduncles and WM (Figure 1). Cortical thickness was reduced in bilateral para- and pre-central regions in PSP compared to PD patients (p < 0.05 and < 0.01 respectively) (Figure 2).

4746,"The PET Radioligand 18F-FIMX Images and Quantifies Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 1 in Proportion to the Regional Density of Its Gene Transcript in Human Brain UNLABELLED: A recent study from our laboratory found that (18)F-FIMX is an excellent PET radioligand for quantifying metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) in monkey brain. This study evaluated the ability of (18)F-FIMX to quantify mGluR1 in humans. A second goal was to use the relative density of mGluR1 gene transcripts in brain regions to estimate specific uptake and nondisplaceable uptake (VND) in each brain region.METHODS: After injection of 189 +/- 3 MBq of (18)F-FIMX, 12 healthy volunteers underwent a dynamic PET scan over 120 min. For 6 volunteers, images were acquired until 210 min. A metabolite-corrected arterial input function was measured from the radial artery. Four other subjects underwent whole-body scanning to estimate radiation exposure.RESULTS: (18)F-FIMX uptake into the human brain was high (SUV = 4-6 in the cerebellum), peaked at about 10 min, and washed out rapidly. An unconstrained 2-tissue-compartment model fitted the data well, and distribution volume (VT) (mLcm(-3)) values ranged from 1.5 in the caudate to 11 in the cerebellum. A 120-min scan provided stable VT values in all regions except the cerebellum, for which an acquisition time of at least 170 min was necessary. VT values in brain regions correlated well with mGluR1 transcript density, and the correlation suggested that VND of (18)F-FIMX was quite low (0.5 mLcm(-3)). This measure of VND in humans was similar to that from a receptor blocking study in monkeys, after correcting for differences in plasma protein binding. Similar to other (18)F-labeled ligands, the effective dose was about 23 muSv/MBq.CONCLUSION: (18)F-FIMX can quantify mGluR1 in the human brain with a 120- to 170-min scan. Correlation of brain uptake with the relative density of mGluR1 transcript allows specific receptor binding of a radioligand to be quantified without injecting pharmacologic doses of a blocking agent.",Excluded,0.085978344
4747,"Flat panel CT following stapes prosthesis insertion: an experimental and clinical study OBJECTIVES: Anatomical information of the middle and inner ear is becoming increasingly important in post-operative evaluation especially after stapesplasty with unsuccessful improvement of the air-bone gap (ABG). So far computed tomography (CT) has been the first choice for detection of reasons for recurrent hearing loss. CT has the disadvantage of metal-induced artefacts after insertion of middle ear implants and of a relatively high irradiation dose.METHODS: Flat panel CT (fpCT) was performed in three temporal bone specimen after experimental insertion of different stapes prostheses, aiming to validate the accuracy of fpCT of the middle and inner ear. Additionally, 28 consecutive patients, supplied with different stapes prostheses underwent post-operative fpCT to compare the pre- and post-operative hearing results with the determined prosthesis position in the middle and inner ear.RESULTS: In all cases, fpCT showed a statistically significant correlation between hearing improvement and prosthesis position. This technique provided detailed post-operative information of the implant position in patients and temporal bone specimen.CONCLUSIONS: The new imaging technique of fpCT allows the immediate and almost artefact-free evaluation of surgical results following stapesplasty. Further benefits are a lower irradiation dose and higher isovolumetric resolution compared with standard CT.KEY POINTS: Flat panel computed tomography (fpCT) helps otosurgeons design precise stapes protheses. fpCT allows a prediction of the postoperative hearing outcome in patients. fpCT is an adequate imaging technique for immediate postoperative quality control.

4749,"Effects of irradiation on brain vasculature using an in situ tumor model PURPOSE: Damage to normal tissue is a limiting factor in clinical radiotherapy (RT). We tested the hypothesis that the presence of tumor alters the response of normal tissues to irradiation using a rat in situ brain tumor model.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Intravital microscopy was used with a rat cranial window to assess the in situ effect of rat C6 glioma on peritumoral tissue with and without RT. The RT regimen included 40 Gy at 8 Gy/day starting Day 5 after tumor implant. Endpoints included blood-brain barrier permeability, clearance index, leukocyte-endothelial interactions and staining for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) glial fibrillary acidic protein, and apoptosis. To characterize the system response to RT, animal survival and tumor surface area and volume were measured. Sham experiments were performed on similar animals implanted with basement membrane matrix absent of tumor cells.RESULTS: The presence of tumor alone increases permeability but has little effect on leukocyte-endothelial interactions and astrogliosis. Radiation alone increases tissue permeability, leukocyte-endothelial interactions, and astrogliosis. The highest levels of permeability and cell adhesion were seen in the model that combined tumor and irradiation; however, the presence of tumor appeared to reduce the volume of rolling leukocytes. Unirradiated tumor and peritumoral tissue had poor clearance. Irradiated tumor and peritumoral tissue had a similar clearance index to irradiated and unirradiated sham-implanted animals. Radiation reduces the presence of VEGF in peritumoral normal tissues but did not affect the amount of apoptosis in the normal tissue. Apoptosis was identified in the tumor tissue with and without radiation.CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel approach to demonstrate that the presence of the tumor in a rat intracranial model alters the response of normal tissues to irradiation.",Excluded,0.9840673
4750,"A rodent in situ glioma allograft model to study bone marrow-derived cell migration Radiotherapy (RT) induced hypoxia recruits bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) to tumors through the upregulation of Stromal Derived Factor-1, a chemokine that binds to receptor CXCR4 present on BMDCs. The infiltration of BMDCs, which includes endothelial progenitors, pericyte progenitors, tumor-associated macrophages, immature monocytes, VEGFR<sup>+</sup> hemangiocytes, and CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells has been implicated in supporting tumor establishment by contributing to tumor growth, angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, inflammation, and immune suppression. In this work, we have used a rodent glioma in situ allograft model to study the recruitment/migration of BMDCs post RT. Female albino C57 (8-10 weeks old, Jackson Laboratories) animals underwent +DsRed bone marrow transplant (B6.Cg-Tg(CAG-DsRed*MST)1Nagy/J donor mouse). Following engraftment, glioma cells were cranially implanted with 1x10 glioma cells (GL261-Luc, Perkin Elmer), at an average size of 26.4mm indicated by a bioluminescence signal of 5.28x10 photons/sec/cm/sr, animals underwent 6Gy (RadSource 2000, 250kVp, 25mA) of irradiation limited to a 1cm wide slit centered on the tumor. Bioluminescence (tumor size) and fluorescence imaging (+DsRed BMDCs) was performed prior to and at 1-and 2-weeks post-RT to assess tumor growth and measure the influx of +DsRed BMDCs. In addition, flow cytometry was used to measure the number of +DsRed BMDCs in the tumor and brain. To study the effect of BMDCs in tumor regression, tumors were irradiated at a smaller size (9.3mm) with 10Gy irradiation. At 1-week post-RT, flow cytometry was used to measure the number of BMDCs (CD45+) in the tumor. In our model 6Gy radiation was able to stall the growth of the tumor. Irradiated tumors did not significantly change in tumor size at either 1-or 2-weeks post irradiation compared to pre-RT size. In addition, irradiated tumors were significantly smaller than untreated tumors (p=0.0008) 1-week post-RT. Using flow cytometry 1-week post irradiation, we observed a significant increase in the number of +DsRed BMDCs in the irradiated tumor (23.5% of cells +DsRed BMDCs) compared to the irradiated brain (6.17% cells +DsRed BMDCs, p=0.03) as well as a significant increase in the tumors (16.6% cells +DsRed BMDCs) compared to the brain (11.1% cells +DsRed BMDCs p=0.02). There was no difference in the number of +DsRed BMDCS in tumors +/- irradiation or brains +/- irradiation. We found similar results in our tumor regression model using flow cytometry 1-week post-RT; we observed an increase in the number of BMDCs CD45+ in the tumor (~20% of cells CD45+) compared to control tumors (~6% of cells CD45+). Indicating that tumor size at the onset of RT did not effect the migration of BMDCs. Fluorescence imaging did not measure any significant change in the DsRed signal at 1-or 2-weeks post-irradiation. We have successfully shown that post-RT there is an increase in BMDCs migration at 1-week post RT regardless of tumor size at RT. Further experimentation is needed to better elucidate the role of BMDCs in tumor inflammation and immune suppression as well as angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Our next step is to perform immunohistochemistry on our collected tumor tissue to map out the spatial location of migrated BMDCs within the tumor.",Excluded,0.9565656

A third group was sham exposed. Field exposure was 8 hrs/day for 5 days/week. Blood samples were collected for hematology determinations before the onset of exposure and at 12 week intervals. At sacrifice, liver, heart, mesenteric lymph nodes, bone marrow, and testes were collected for morphology and histology assessments, while the pineal gland and brain were collected for biochemical determinations. At both field strength combinations, no pathological changes were observed in animal growth rate, in morphology and histology of the collected tissue specimens (liver, heart, mesenteric lymph nodes, testes, bone marrow), and in serum chemistry. An increase in norepinephrine levels occurred in the pineal gland of rats exposed to the higher field strength.

Annual effective doses for flight crew have been estimated to be in the order of 2-5 mSv and can attain 75 mSv at career end. Epidemiological studies in this occupational group have been conducted over the last 15-20 years, usually with a focus on radiation-associated cancer. These studies are summarised in this note. Overall cancer risk was not elevated in most studies and subpopulations analysed, while malignant melanoma, other skin cancers and breast cancer in female aircrew have shown elevated incidence, with lesser risk elevations in terms of mortality. In some studies, including the large German cohort, brain cancer risk appears elevated. Cardiovascular mortality risks were generally very low. Dose information for pilots was usually derived from calculation procedures based on routine licence information, types of aircraft and routes/hours flown, but not on direct measurements. However, dose estimates have shown high validity when compared with measured values. No clear-cut dose-response patterns pointing to a higher risk for those with higher cumulative doses were found. Studies on other health outcomes have shown mixed results.

Treatment response was evaluated in terms of symptoms, neurologic status, and, in most cases, reduction of tumor on repeat myelography. At the completion of therapy, 92% of treated patients experienced pain relief and 67% had significant to complete improvement on neurologic examination. Thirty days after treatment, repeat myelography was performed in 40 of the 50 cases; compared with the initial findings immediately preceding radiation therapy (RT), the results of 58% of these studies had normalized completely, results were improved in 25%, and the results had not changed in 18%. The presence of a high-grade compression fracture of the vertebral body was an indicator of poor prognosis for tumor response on repeat myelography. The ability of a patient to walk before treatment and tumor response on repeat myelography were associated significantly with improved outcome of RT and with survival. The authors conclude that RT can effectively palliate epidural lesions from metastatic prostate cancer. The prognosis for the long-term response to therapy may be indicated by pretreatment ambulatory status and posttreatment imaging of the epidural space.",Excluded,0.09471582
4754,"Aggressive and malignant prolactin pituitary tumors: pathological diagnosis and patient management According to the World Health Organization classification of pituitary tumors, only tumors with systemic metastasis must be considered as carcinomas. Invasive tumors with multiple recurrences are only classified as aggressive tumors or ""atypical adenomas"". To illustrate the problems encountered in the pathological diagnosis of pituitary carcinoma and in patient management, we present two male patients operated on for an aggressive prolactin pituitary adenoma with and without metastasis. In case 1, 5 surgeries, 3 irradiations, increased doses of dopamine agonists, and trials of temozolomide and carboplatine-VP16 failed to control tumor progression and the appearance of metastases which lead to death 16 years after onset. In case 2, based on the initial diagnosis of an aggressive-invasive adenoma that was resistant to dopamine agonists, gamma-Knife irradiation was initially performed on the intra-cavernous remnant. Eight years after onset, the remnant remained stabilized and the plasma PRL normalized under dopamine agonist. From these 2 cases alongside other cases found in the literature, we propose that the association of certain clinical signs (male sex, dopamine-resistant hyperprolactinemia), radiological signs (invasive macro or giant tumor on MRI) and histological signs (angiogenesis, Ki-67 > 3%, p53 positive, mitoses >2 per high power field, vascular invasion, up-regulation of genes related to invasion and proliferation, and allelic loss of chromosome 11) might suggest aggressiveness and be suspicious of malignancy before the appearance of metastasis.

There are few studies reporting effective countermeasures to cognition decline in astronauts during space flight. Accordingly, we examined whether rTMS was able to significantly alleviate the learning and memory deficits induced by hindlimb unloading (HU), a general accepted rodent model to simulate microgravity, in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four groups: Sham, rTMS, HU, and HU+rTMS groups. The hindlimb unloading procedure continued for consecutive 14 days. Meanwhile, high frequency rTMS (15Hz) was applied for 14 days from the 1<sup>st</sup> day of HU procedure. The novel object recognition test showed that the recognition memory was evidently impaired in the HU group compared to that in the Sham group, however, rTMS significantly attenuated the impairment of the memory. Furthermore, rTMS significantly improved the HU-induced LTP impairment and increased spine density in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region. Additionally, rTMS enhanced the expressions of postsynaptic function-associated proteins N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NR2B and NR2A) and postsynaptic density protein (PSD95), upregulated BDNF/TrkB signaling and increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) in the HU+rTMS group.

The underlying hypothesis was that TRT will improve outcomes in this favorable patient population.METHODS: 305 patients were included in an institutional review board (IRB)-approved study, of which 105 received TRT after chemotherapy (ChT) and 200 received ChT alone. The survival outcomes were compared between ChT+TRT group and ChT-alone group in patients with oligometastasis without brain or liver involved and patients with brain/liver/multimetastasis, respectively.RESULTS: The 1-year, 2-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) for all patients were 60.3%, 23.9% and 1.6%, respectively. The addition of TRT significantly improved PFS in total patients than ChT alone (14.5 months vs. 10.1 months, p = 0.006), but the OS benefit was not significant (17.8 months vs. 16.5 months, p = 0.061). For patients with oligometastasis (n = 118), TRT offered significant progression free survival (PFS) (16.5 months vs. 9.1 months, p = 0.005) and OS (19.2 months vs. 15.6 months, p = 0.039) benefits.

4759,"Results of carbon ion radiotherapy for skin carcinomas in 45 patients UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND; Heavy ions represent the best tool for external radiotherapy (RT) of inoperable tumours. Heavy ion RT has been used in the treatment of various tumours, especially for radioresistant tumours mediated by hypoxia, localized near organs at risk. Most of these treatments are concentrated in deep-seated tumours such as those of the brain, head, lung, liver, rectum and urogenital organs, and treatment of skin carcinomas is limited.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the outcome and toxicity after carbon ion RT for skin carcinomas at the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou, China.METHODS: Between November 2006 and March 2009, 45 patients with skin carcinoma [squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (n = 16), basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (n = 12), malignant melanoma (MM) (n = 7), Bowen disease (n = 8) and Paget disease (n = 2)] were treated with carbon ion RT within a clinical Phase I trial. Patients received total doses of 60-70 GyE for SCC and BCC, 61-75 GyE for MM, 60 GyE for Bowen disease and 42.5 GyE for Paget disease, administered in 6-11 fractions over 6-11 days, with a fraction dose of 7-10 GyE.RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 24 months, range 12-36 months.

MYCN overexpression is strongly associated with advanced disease stage, rapid tumor progression and a worse prognosis. In the present study, we identified microRNA-375 (miR-375) as a negative regulator of MYCN: enforced expression of miR-375 inhibited MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo. Upon searching the website miRbase for possible miR-375 binding sites within the whole MYCN mRNA, we found that the MYCN 5'-UTR had significant sequence complementarity to miR-375, yet no complementary sequences existed within the MYCN 3'-UTR and coding regions. Enforced overexpression of miR-375 efficiently inhibited MYCN mRNA translation and protein synthesis, via an IRES-dependent mechanism. In athymic nude mouse model with human MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, MYCN downregulation by miR-375 led to inhibition of tumor cell growth and tumorigenicity. In particular, miR-375-regulated inhibition of MYCN translation was enhanced when MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells were exposed to stress stimulation, such as ionizing irradiation (IR), resulting in a remarkable increase in the neuroblastoma's sensitivity to IR-induced cell death. Our results identified a novel mechanism by which IRES-dependent translation of MYCN is repressed by miR-375, particularly during cellular stress, highlighting a potential anticancer strategy: the development of miR-375 as a novel therapeutic agent to treat MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.",Excluded,0.086447686
4761,"Radiation-induced DNA damage in tumors and normal tissues. II. Influence of dose, residual DNA damage and physiological factors in oxygenated cells Detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors is important for many experimental and clinical situations. Several laboratories, including ours, have suggested that assays which measure radiation-induced DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) might be used to detect or quantify hypoxic cells in tumors and normal tissues. Recently, we demonstrated the feasibility of using an alkaline elution assay that measures strand breaks and DPCs to detect and/or quantify hypoxic cells in tissues. For this approach to be valid, DPCs must not be formed to any great extent in irradiated oxygenated cells, and the formation and repair of strand breaks and DPCs in oxygenated cells must not be modified appreciably by physiological factors (e.g. temperature, pH and nutrient depletion) that are often found in solid tumors. To address these issues, two sets of experiments were performed. In one set of experiments, oxygenated 9L cells in tissue culture, subcutaneous 9L tumors and rat cerebella were irradiated with doses of 15 or 50 Gy and allowed to repair until the residual strand break damage was low enough to detect DPCs. In another set of experiments, oxygenated exponentially growing or plateau-phase 9L cells in tissue culture were irradiated with a dose of 15 Gy at 37 or 20 degrees C, while the cells were maintained at a pH of either 6.6 or 7.3. DNA-protein crosslinks were formed in oxygenated cells about 100 times less efficiently than in hypoxic cells. In addition, temperature, pH, nutrient depletion and growth phase did not appreciably alter the formation and repair of strand breaks or the formation of DPCs in oxygenated 9L cells. These results support the use of this DNA damage assay for the detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors.",Included,0.08595349
4762,"Hippocampal-sparing and target volume coverage in treating 3 to 10 brain metastases: A comparison of Gamma Knife, single-isocenter VMAT, CyberKnife, and TomoTherapy stereotactic radiosurgery PURPOSE: Our purpose was to evaluate hippocampal doses and target volume coverage with and without hippocampal sparing when treating multiple brain metastases using various stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) platforms.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We selected 10 consecutive patients with 14 separate treatments who had been treated in our department for 3 to 10 brain metastases and added hippocampal avoidance contours. All 14 treatments were planned with GammaPlan for Gamma Knife, Eclipse for single isocenter volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), TomoTherapy Treatment Planning System (TPS) for TomoTherapy, and MultiPlan for CyberKnife. Initial planning was performed with the goal of planning target volume coverage of V100 >=95% without hippocampal avoidance. If the maximum hippocampal point dose (Dmax) was <6.6 Gy in a single fraction and <40% of the hippocampi received <=4.5 Gy, no second plan was performed. If either constraint was not met, replanning was performed with these constraints.RESULTS: There was a median of 6 metastases per plan, with an average total tumor volume of 7.32 mL per plan. The median hippocampal Dmax (in Gy) without sparing averaged 1.65, 9.81, 4.38, and 5.46, respectively (P < .0001). Of 14 plans, 3 Gamma Knife and CyberKnife plans required replanning, whereas 13 VMAT and 8 TomoTherapy plans required replanning. The hippocampal constraints were not achievable in 1 plan on any platform when the tumor was bordering the hippocampus. The mean volume of brain receiving 12 Gy (in mL), which has been associated with symptomatic radionecrosis, was 23.57 with Gamma Knife, 76.77 with VMAT, 40.86 with CyberKnife, and 104.06 with TomoTherapy (P = .01). The overall average conformity indices for all plans ranged from 0.36 to 0.52.CONCLUSIONS: Even with SRS, the hippocampi can receive a considerable dose; however, if the hippocampi are outlined as organs of risk, sparing these structures is feasible in nearly all situations with all 4 platforms, without detriment to target coverage, and should be considered in all patients undergoing SRS for multiple brain metastases.SUMMARY: Hippocampi play an important role in memory, and sparing of these structures in whole brain radiation can improve neurocognitive outcomes. The hippocampi are not routinely spared when using stereotactic radiosurgery. We evaluated the incidental dose to the hippocampi when treating multiple brain metastases and sought to examine if hippocampal sparing is feasible without detriment to target coverage. We found that hippocampal sparing is possible without affecting coverage or conformality in most cases across treatment platforms.",Excluded,0.08690607

Here we report that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, after being subretinally transplanted into normal or Nd: YAG laser-injured rat eye, can integrate into RPE layer, photoreceptor layer, bipolar cell layer and ganglion layer. DAPI-labeling detection was used to trace the origin of the repopulating cells. DAPI fluorescence was used to identify retina cells of bone marrow origin 10, 20, 35 and 50 days after transplantation. No formation of rosettes was found but some random cells were found at the end of the observation. MSCs-originated cells spread more widely in the injured retinas than in the normal ones. Immunohistochemical detection showed that though the cells could express neuronal nuclei (NeuN), neuron specific enolase (NSE), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cytokeratin (CK), the proteins expression in the injured transplantation group was abnormal in some region compared with that in the normal transplantation group. Electroretinogram (ERG) showed that ERG-b wave of the injured transplantation group is significantly higher than that of the two laser-injured control groups. These results suggest that a proportion of MSCs can differentiate into retina-like structure in vivo and the differentiation differs in normal and laser-injured retinas.",Excluded,0.08716952
4764,"Acute effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic field emitted by mobile phone on brain function Due to its attributes, characteristics, and technological resources, the mobile phone (MP) has become one of the most commonly used communication devices. Historically, ample evidence has ruled out the substantial short-term impact of radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) emitted by MP on human cognitive performance. However, more recent evidence suggests potential harmful effects associated with MP EMF exposure. The aim of this review is to readdress the question of whether the effect of MP EMF exposure on brain function should be reopened. We strengthen our argument focusing on recent neuroimaging and electroencephalography studies, in order to present a more specific analysis of effects of MP EMF exposure on neurocognitive function. Several studies indicate an increase in cortical excitability and/or efficiency with EMF exposure, which appears to be more prominent in fronto-temporal regions and has been associated with faster reaction time. Cortical excitability might also underpin disruption to sleep. However, several inconsistent findings exist, and conclusions regarding adverse effects of EMF exposure are currently limited. It also should be noted that the crucial scientific question of the effect of longer-term MP EMF exposure on brain function remains unanswered and essentially unaddressed.

4765,"Computed tomography-guided interstitial 125iodine seed brachytherapy as a salvage therapy for recurrent spinal bone metastases after radiotherapy Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of permanent 125I seed interstitial brachytherapy in patients with recurrent spinal bone metastases under CT guidance. Material(s) and Method(s): From November 2010 to November 2015, 17 patients who met the inclusion criteria were retrospectively reviewed. There were 12 men and 5 women with a median age of 56 years (range 24-83 years). There were 10 lung carcinomas, 4 esophagus carcinomas , 1 liver cancer, 1 breast cancer, and 1 kidney carcinoma . 6 had squamous cell carcinoma, 8 were adenocarcinoma, 3 others respectively. All patients suffered varying degrees of pain before seed implantation, ranging from 1 to 9 on the NRS. Mean NRS scores before implantation was 6.88 +/- 2.25 respectively. Regarding neurologic function, 2 grade Bs, 2 grade Cs, 3 grade Ds and 10 grade Es. All patients with recurrent spinal bone metastases had received conventional EBRT. During the procedure, patients remained in a prone position to facilitate CT guidance. We measured the pedicle angle and the distance of the puncture point. The depth of the puncture point to the pedicle was also borne in mind. Needles were inserted through the anterior portion of the lateral images, in the interval between the pedicle and the vertebral body, or with a pedicle or paraspinal approach, respectively. Seeds were implanted 1.0 cm from the spinal cord, to minimize radiation damage. Immediately after the procedure, a CT scan was obtained to confirm the location of the seeds in case of any need for supplementary implantation. The number of 125I seeds implanted ranged from 18 to 62 (median 30) with specific activity of 0.5-0.8 mCi (median 0.75 mCi). The post-plan showed that the actuarial D90 of 125I seeds were 60.5-154 Gy(median 106 Gy). The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 59 months (median 7 months). The local control rate was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): For all patients, the 1-,2-year overall survival rates were 74.8%, 49.8%, respectively, with a median of 15 months (range, 1-59 months), the 1-, 2-year local control rates were 54.1%, 36.1%, respectively, with a median of 14 months (range, 1-59 months). During the follow-up period, 5.9% (1/17) died from metastases, 5.9% (1/17) died from developed local recurrence,11.8% (2/17) died from primary tumors, 5.9% (1/17) died from another reason, while 70.6% (12/17) remained alive,100% experienced pain relief, and mean NRS scores after implantation was 2.06 +/- 2.08 respectively.

4766,"The inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced neuronal apoptosis via AMPKalpha1 signaling-mediated autophagy Due to an increasing concern about radiation-induced cognitive deficits for brain tumor patients receiving radiation therapy, developing and evaluating countermeasures has become inevitable. Our previous study has found that minocycline, a clinical available antibiotics that can easily cross the blood brain barrier, mitigates radiation-induced long-term memory loss in rats, accompanied by decreased hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Thus, in the present study, we report an unknown mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of minocycline. We demonstrated that minocycline prevented primary neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis and promoted radiation-induced autophagy in vitro. Moreover, using an immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line, HT22 cells, we found that the protective effect of minocycline on irradiated HT22 cells was not related to DNA damage repair since minocycline did not facilitate DNA DSB repair in irradiated HT22 cells. Further investigation showed that minocycline significantly enhanced X-irradiation-induced AMPKalpha1 activation and autophagy, thus resulting in decreased apoptosis. Additionally, although the antioxidant potential of minocycline might contribute to its apoptosis-inhibitory effect, it was not involved in its enhancive effect on radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy. Taken together, we have revealed a novel mechanism for the protective effect of minocycline on irradiated neurons, e.g. minocycline protects neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis via enhancing radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy.",Included,0.682534
4767,"The inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced neuronal apoptosis via AMPKalpha1 signaling-mediated autophagy Purpose/Objective(s): In our previous study, we have found that minocycline, a clinical available antibiotics that can easily cross the blood brain barrier, mitigates radiation-induced long-term memory loss in rats, accompanied by decreased hippocampal neuron apoptosis shortly after radiation. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the detailed mechanisms underlying the protective effect of minocycline on neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis. Purpose/Objective(s): The immortalized mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cell line was used. The protective effect of minocycline on X-irradiated HT22 cells was demonstrated using clonogenic assay and apoptosis analysis. The underlying mechanisms were explored by using methods such as flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, shRNA knockdown, Western blot et al. Result(s): We found that minocycline protected HT22 hippocampal neurons from radiation-induced cell death, manifest as increased clonogenic cell survival and decreased apoptosis in irradiated cells. This protective effect of minocycline might involve cell cycle perturbation after radiation, but not DNA damage and repair. Further investigation showed that X-irradiation activated AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy, and minocycline significantly enhanced AMPKalpha1 activation and autophagy, resulting in decreased apoptosis. Additionally, the antioxidant potential of minocycline might not be involved in the enhancing effect of minocycline on radiation-induced autophagy, but it might at least partially contribute to the inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced apoptosis. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that minocycline protects neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis mainly through targeting radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy.",Included,0.96755433
4768,"Reduction in radiation during percutaneous lumbar pedicle screw placement using a new device OBJECTIVE: To assess a new intradermal locator device for percutaneous placement of lumbar pedicle screws.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were alternately assigned to two groups. The locator group underwent lumbar pedicle screw placement using the intradermal locator. The control group was aided by traditional fluoroscopy. Baseline demographics, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, operation time, intraoperative fluoroscopy time and guidewire insertion time were recorded. All postoperative CT scans were reviewed by an independent spine surgeon to grade screw placement accuracy.RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (180 screws) were assigned to the locator group and 30 patients (128 screws) to the control group. The locator device could significantly reduce the fluoroscopy time [3.9 sec (SD = 1.9) vs. 9.6 sec (SD = 5.8), p < 0.001] and guidewire insertion time [2.69 min (SD = 0.67) vs. 4.49 min (SD = 1.96), p < 0.001] compared with the conventional method for each pedicle screw. The whole operation time of the locator group was shorter than that of the control group [2-segment: 243.2 min (SD = 16.9) vs. 301.7 min (SD = 14.9), p < 0.001; 1-segment: 154.5 min (SD = 14.3) vs. 194.6 min (SD = 19.3), p < 0.001]. As for the rates of pedicle breaches, postoperative VAS scores, no significant difference was found between the two groups.CONCLUSION: The intradermal locator device could help reduce the radiation exposure in percutaneous pedicle screw placement while maintaining the accuracy.",Excluded,0.087972336
4769,"Both anti-HER2 treatment and chemotherapy after whole-brain radiation therapy improve survival in patients with brain metastases from HER2-positive breast cancer Purpose/Objective(s): Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) remains the most widely used treatment for brain metastasis (BM) from breast cancer (BC), especially for pts with multiple intracranial lesions. Growing evidence has suggested that systemic treatment can improve survival in addition to WBRT. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of post- WBRT anti-HER2 and other systemic treatments on survival after BM from Her-2 positive BC. Materials/Methods: A total of 54 pts with BM from HER2-positive BC treated with WBRT in single institute between January 2006 and February 2012 was retrospectively analyzed, 42 pts (77.8%) had multiple lesions. The brain was the first metastatic site for 15 pts (27.8%). Post-WBRT anti- HER2 treatment was given in 21 pts (38.9%), 9 pts received trastuzumab, 9 pts received lapatinib and the other 3 received both trastuzumab and lapatinib. Post-WBRT chemotherapy was given in 39 pts, 19 in combination with anti-HER2 treatment. Prognostic analysis was performed including age at BM, KPS/RPA, ER/PR status, number of BM, interval between BC diagnosis and BM, presence of extracranial metastases, extracranial metastases control, chemotherapy after WBRT and anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT. Radiation dose of EQD2 <=40 Gy (a/s=4.6 Gy) was given in 26 pts (74.3%). Result(s): The median interval from diagnosis of BC to the identification of BM was 29 months (range, 2-136 months). In univariate analysis, age, KPS/RPA classes, number of BM, extracranial metastases control, chemotherapy after WBRT and anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT were significant prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) (p < 0.05). While in multivariate analysis, extracranial metastases control, chemotherapy after WBRT and anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT were significant prognostic factors for OS. No impact of radiation doses and ER/PR status on OS were found. The median survival for the whole group was 12 months, which was 21 and 9 months, respectively (p=0.004) in pts with and without anti- HER2 treatment after WBRT, 16 and 6 months in pts with and without chemotherapy (p < 0.001).

Among them, 42 patients received chemotherapy while 18 patients did not receive after WBRT. With regard to anti-HER2 therapy, after WBRT, 17 patients received anti-HER2 treatment without prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy, 7 patients received anti-HER2 treatment with prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy, and 36 patients did not receive further anti-HER2 treatment. All patients were followed up regularly until January 23, 2013.RESULTS: The median OS of patients with BM was 12 months. Patients who received anti-HER2 therapy and chemotherapy after WBRT had significantly better survival compared with patients who did not receive further treatment. Patients who received anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT but did not receive adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy for early breast cancer had better OS, followed by patients who received anti-HER2 agent both in adjuvant treatment and after WBRT and patients who did not receive anti-HER2 treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that Karnofsky Performance Status, control of extracranial metastases, chemotherapy after WBRT, and anti-HER2 therapy combined with WBRT were all independent predictors for OS.CONCLUSION: Both chemotherapy and anti-HER2 therapy after WBRT could improve OS. Moreover, patients without prior exposure to adjuvant anti-HER2 treatment may have survival benefit superior to those of patients with prior exposure.",Excluded,0.81635463
4771,"Risk factors of brain metastases as initial failure for completely resected stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer Purpose/Objective(s): Brain metastasis (BM) is the main sign of failure of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). The lymph node (LN) status is a major determinant of outcome in patients with NSCLC, but whether or not the LN status is a major determinant of BM remains unclear. In the present study, we focused on completely resected staged IIIA (N2) LA-NSCLC to explore the correlation between LN status and BM. We also aimed to identify the risk factors of BM as the initial site of failure, as well as the potential highest-risk candidates who are most likely to benefit from prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Materials/Methods: The medical records of 357 consecutive patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC who underwent complete surgery were reviewed between January 2005 and June 2012. Time to BM as the initial site of failure was measured from the date of surgery to the date of BM in the patients who developed distant metastases or both local and distant recurrence as the initial failure, with BM defined as an event. The cumulative incidence of BM as the initial site of failure and survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. To assess the risk factors of BM, the log-rank test was used for univariate analysis, and Cox regression was used for multivariate analysis. Result(s): A total of 73 (20.4%) patients developed BM, and 60 patients had BM as their initial site of failure. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year risks for patients developing BM as the initial site of failure were 9.1%, 27.4%, and 35.4%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that non-squamous cell cancer (P = 0.000), positive extra-capsular extension of LN metastasis (P=0.041), number of metastatic LN > 4 (P = 0.018), multiple N2 stations (P = 0.027), and multiple regions of mediastinal LN (MLN) involvement (P = 0.010) were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing BM as the initial site of failure. Multivariate analysis showed that non-squamous cell cancer (P = 0.002; HR = 5.148; 95% CI = 1.863-14.222) and multiple regions of MLN involvement (P = 0.015; HR = 0.556; 95% CI = 0.326-0.948) were significantly associated with the high risk of BM as the initial site of failure. In patients with nonsquamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement, the fiveyear actuarial risk of BM as the initial failure was 47.6%. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated that non-squamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement were independent risk factors for BM as the initial failure in completely resected IIIA (N2) NSCLC. Patients with non-squamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement are at the highest risk of developing BM as the initial failure, and may receive a greater benefit from PCI.

Therefore, effective treatment is still a challenge at present. Moreover, little is known about the value of radiotherapy in the treatment of PTCL-NOS.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 55-year-old male patient with eating difficulties and progressive exacerbation for 3 months was diagnosed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Airway compression occurred after 2 cycles of first line treatment with cyclophosphamide-Adriamycin-vincristine-prednisone regimen, radiotherapy (48Gy/24f) was given as the second line therapy.DIAGNOSIS: After radiotherapy, the patient complained that mild intermittent dysphagia still existed. Endoscopic biopsy of the upper digestive tract confirmed necrotic material and superficial squamous epithelial mucosa, suggesting esophageal stricture after radiotherapy, which was indistinguishable from tumor residue.INTERVENTIONS: The patient received anti-inflammatory treatment outside the hospital and did not receive any other special treatment.OUTCOMES: The symptoms of dysphagia disappeared and the focus showed complete response (CR). As of October 1, 2020, the patient has been diagnosed with PTCL-NOS for more than 57 months and the overall survival (OS) have not been achieved.LESSONS: Radiotherapy has obvious and rapid anti-tumor effect on cyclophosphamide-Adriamycin-vincristine-prednisone refractory PTCL-NOS.

4773,"Computed Tomography Image Analysis and Clinical Diagnosis Value of Nasal Olfactory Neuroblastoma Background: This article retrospectively analyzed the data of all patients diagnosed with malignant tumors of the nasal cavity and sinuses by pathologic section in all patients (including outpatients and inpatients) in our hospital from January 2008 to December 2017 (10 years) to discuss the nasal cavity The clinical characteristics of sinus malignant tumors and the clinical characteristics (symptoms, signs, imaging examinations) of 35 cases of olfactory neuroblastoma with high incidence were analyzed, and their treatment methods and prognosis were summarized for future nasal tumors. Clinical Basis for Prevention and Treatment: In our department, 300 cases of malignant tumors of nasal cavity and sinuses were treated within 10 years. Age: Eighty-six cases (28.6%) were in the age group 50-59 years old, occupying first place, and 55 cases (18.3%) were in the age group 60-69 years old, occupying second place. By comparing groups A and B with malignant tumors of the nasal cavity and sinuses, the difference in age distribution of olfactory neuroblastoma is statistically significant. Of the 35 cases of olfactory neuroblastoma, 23 cases were diagnosed with nasal tumors on admission, 12 cases were initially diagnosed with nasal polyps (including 7 cases with hemorrhagic and necrotic nasal polyps), and 20 cases underwent rapid pathologic definite diagnosis during the operation. Diagnosis for Postoperative Pathologic Returns: On the basis of our analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn: Of the 300 cases of malignant tumors of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, age distribution tends to be younger, the overall incidence of males is higher than that of females, but the proportion of male and female olfactory neuroblastoma is equal, and the incidence of adenoid cystic carcinoma and sarcoma. The morphology of cancer can be divided as follows: the tissue source is epithelial tissue, the cancer is harder, paler, drier, and often forms cancer nests, the parenchymal and interstitial boundaries are clear, and the fibrous tissue is hyperplastic. The incidence rate of females is higher than that of males, with the primary origin in the sinuses. Among them, the maxillary sinus is more common.

4774,"Penguin Suit and Fetal Position Finite Element Model to Prevent Low Back Pain in Spaceflight <b>BACKGROUND:</b> This study aimed to investigate the biomechanical effects of different interventions on astronauts lumbar intervertebral discs in a microgravity environment during spaceflight and in a gravity environment when the astronaut returns. <b>METHODS:</b> A finite element model of the L4L5 lumbar segment was developed with eight loading schemes representing different interventions. The loading schemes included no intervention, wearing a penguin suit, sleeping in a fetal position, wearing a penguin suit combined with sleeping in the fetal position, reclining for 4 or 16 h/d, and maintaining upright posture for 4 or 16 h/d. <b>RESULTS:</b> Without intervention, the microgravity environment led to increased central pore pressure, radial displacement, and water content in the lumbar intervertebral disc. Wearing a penguin suit combined with sleeping in the fetal position can reduce disc pore pressure, axial stress, radial displacement, and water content to 0.156 MPa, 11.50 kPa, 0.538 mm, and 1.390%, respectively. When astronauts return to the gravity environment, staying upright for 4 h can reduce the pore pressure, axial stress, radial displacement, and water content of the intervertebral disc to 0.222 MPa, 10.72 kPa, 0.373 mm, and 0.219%, respectively. <b>CONCLUSION:</b> This study showed that wearing a penguin suit and sleeping in the fetal position both have the potential to protect the lumbar intervertebral disc from the negative effects caused by microgravity.

Noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy plans consisted of 4 noncoplanar arcs and 2 full coplanar arcs, respectively. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy plans consisted of 7 coplanar fields. CyberKnife plans used skull tracking to ensure accurate position. All plans were generated to cover 95% target volume with prescription dose. Gradient index, conformity index, normal brain tissue volume (V <sub>3Gy</sub> - V <sub>24Gy</sub>), monitor units, and beam on time were evaluated.RESULTS: Gradient index was the lowest for CyberKnife (3.49 +/- 0.65), followed by noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (4.21 +/- 1.38), coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (4.87 +/- 1.35), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (5.36 +/- 1.98). Conformity index was the largest for noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (0.87 +/- 0.03), followed by coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (0.86 +/- 0.04), CyberKnife (0.86 +/- 0.07), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (0.85 +/- 0.05). Normal brain tissue volume at high-to-moderate dose spreads (V <sub>24Gy</sub> - V <sub>9Gy</sub>) was significantly reduced in noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy over that of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy. Normal brain tissue volume for noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy was comparable with noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy at high-dose level (V <sub>24Gy</sub> - V <sub>15Gy</sub>) and larger than CyberKnife at moderate-to-low dose level (V <sub>12Gy</sub> - V <sub>3Gy</sub>). Monitor units was highest for CyberKnife (28 733.59 +/- 7197.85), followed by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (4128.40 +/- 1185.38), noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (3105.20 +/- 371.23), and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (2997.27 +/- 446.84). Beam on time was longest for CyberKnife (30.25 +/- 7.32 minutes), followed by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (2.95 +/- 0.85 minutes), noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (2.61 +/- 0.07 minutes), and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (2.30 +/- 0.23 minutes).CONCLUSION: For brain metastases far away from organs-at-risk, noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy generated more rapid dose falloff and higher conformity compared to intensity-modulated radiation therapy and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy. Noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy provided a comparable dose falloff with CyberKnife at high-dose level and a slower dose falloff than CyberKnife at moderate-to-low dose level.

4776,"Response characterstics of spinothalamic tract neurons that project to the posterior thalamus in rats A sizeable number of spinothalamic tract axons terminate in the posterior thalamus. The functional roles and precise areas of termination of these axons have been a subject of recent controversy. The goals of this study were to identify spinothalamic tract neurons (STT) within the cervical enlargement that project to this area, characterize their responses to mechanical and thermal stimulation of their receptive fields, and use microantidromic tracking methods to determine the nuclei in which their axons terminate. Forty-seven neurons were antidromically activated using low-amplitude (< or =30 microA) current pulses in the contralateral posterior thalamus. The 51 points at which antidromic activation thresholds were lowest were surrounded by ineffective tracks indicating that the surrounded axons terminated within the posterior thalamus. The areas of termination were located primarily in the posterior triangular, medial geniculate, posterior and posterior intralaminar, and suprageniculate nuclei. Recording points were located in the superficial and deep dorsal horn. The mean antidromic conduction velocity was 6.4 m/s, a conduction velocity slower than that of other projections to the thalamus or hypothalamus in rats. Cutaneous receptive fields appeared to be smaller than those of neurons projecting to other areas of the thalamus or to the hypothalamus. Each of the examined neurons responded exclusively or preferentially to noxious stimuli. These findings indicate that the STT carries nociceptive information to several target nuclei within the posterior thalamus. We discuss the evidence that this projection provides nociceptive information that plays an important role in fear conditioning.",Excluded,0.08581142
4777,"Microwaves and Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's diseases (AD) is the most common type of dementia and a neurodegenerative disease that occurs when the nerve cells in the brain die. The cause and treatment of AD remain unknown. However, AD is a disease that affects the brain, an organ that controls behavior. Accordingly, anything that can interact with the brain may affect this organ positively or negatively, thereby protecting or encouraging AD. In this regard, modern life encompasses microwaves for all issues including industrial, communications, medical and domestic tenders, and among all applications, the cell phone wave, which directly exposes the brain, continues to be the most used. Evidence suggests that microwaves may produce various biological effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and many arguments relay the possibility that microwaves may be involved in the pathophysiology of CNS disease, including AD. By contrast, previous studies have reported some beneficial cognitive effects and that microwaves may protect against cognitive impairment in AD. However, although many of the beneficial effects of microwaves are derived from animal models, but can easily be extrapolated to humans, whether microwaves cause AD is an important issue that is to be addressed in the current review.

Each patient had both a planning CT and weekly repeated CT. Simulated plans that were generated by using the same beam configurations mapped to the repeated CT represented the actual delivered doses to the target volumes and OARs. An IMRT replanning was performed with the fifth week CT scan. Doses among the initial plan, the simulated plans and replanning were compared.RESULTS: There were no significant dosimetric differences in the gross tumour volume, clinical target volume (CTV) 1 or CTV2 for either the simulated plans or the replanning compared with the initial plan. Dosimetric variability of both parotid glands and the brain stem were unique to each individual, and doses to the spinal cord were always maintained within the limit. Replanning in the fifth week had significantly decreased the doses delivered to both parotids (p-values of the mean dose were 0.015 and 0.026 for the left and right parotid, respectively), whereas it did not reduce the doses to the brain stem and spinal cord. There was no relationship between dose variability and weight loss.CONCLUSIONS: There are no significant dose changes for target volumes and spinal cord, and doses to the brain stem and both parotid glands changed individually during NPC IMRT.

4780,"Performance of long rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator PET detectors PURPOSE: High-sensitivity and high-resolution depth-encoding positron emission tomography (PET) detectors are required to simultaneously improve the sensitivity and spatial resolution of a PET scanner so that the quantitative accuracy of PET studies can be improved. The semi-monolithic scintillator PET detector has the advantage of measuring the depth of interaction with single-ended readout as compared to the traditional pixelated scintillator detector, and significantly reducing the edge effect that deteriorates the spatial resolution at edges of the detector as compared to the monolithic scintillator detector if a long rectangular semi-monolithic detector is used. In this work, depth-encoding PET detector modules were built by using long rectangular semi-monolithic scintillators and single-ended readout by silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays. The performance of the detector modules was measured.METHODS: The rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator detector has an outside dimension of 11.6 x 37.6 x 10 mm<sup>3</sup> and consists of 11 polished lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) slices measuring 1 x 37.6 x 10 mm<sup>3</sup> . The enhanced specular reflector (ESR) was glued on both cross-sectional surfaces of each crystal slice. For the face opposite to the SiPM array and the two end faces of the detectors, surface treatments with and without black paint were implemented for performance comparison. The bottom face of the semi-monolithic detector was coupled to a 4 x 12 SiPM array that was grouped along rows and columns separately into 16 signals. The four row signals were used to identify the slices, and the 12 column signals were used to estimate the y (monolithic direction) and z (depth direction) interaction positions. The detector was irradiated at multiple positions with a collimated 511 keV gamma beam. The collimated beam was obtained with electronic collimation by using a <sup>22</sup> Na point source and a reference detector. The estimated width of the gamma beam is around 0.5 mm. The flood histogram for crystal slices was measured by using the center of gravity (COG) method. The COG method and the squared COG method were used for y position estimation. The standard deviation of the column signals, the ratio of maximum to the sum of the column signals, and the sum of squared column signals were used for z position estimation.RESULTS: All slices were clearly resolved from the measured flood histograms for both detectors with different crystal surface treatments. The estimated y positions roughly linearly change with the true positions at the middle of the detector until ~5 mm from both ends of the detector. The y and z spatial resolutions of the detectors were estimated for all middle positions located more than 5 mm from both ends of the detector. The squared COG method provides better y position resolution than the COG method. The three z estimation methods provide similar depth of interaction (DOI) resolution. Surface treatment with black paint significantly improves both y and z position resolution but degrades the energy and timing resolution of the detectors. The average full width half maxima (FWHM) spatial resolution is improved from 1.77 to 1.07 mm in the y direction by using the squared COG method and from 2.71 to 1.55 mm in the z direction by using the standard deviation method. The slice-based average energy resolution degrades from 15.8% to 24.9%. The timing resolution of the entire detector module degrades from 596 to 788 ps.CONCLUSION: The performance of rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator PET detectors with two different crystal surface treatments was measured. The detectors provide superior spatial resolution and depth-encoding capability and can be used to develop small animal and dedicated breast and brain PET scanners that can simultaneously achieve high spatial resolution, high sensitivity, and low cost.",Excluded,0.08611241
4781,"Involvement of nitric oxide in long-term potentiation of spinal nociceptive responses in rats Nitric oxide plays an important role in spinal nociception. The present study explored the effects of nitric oxide on the spinal long-term potentiation associated with nociception. (1) Nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME (1 mM, 20 microl) and the nitric oxide scavenger hemoglobin (2 mg/ml, 20 mul) strikingly blocked the induction of tetanic sciatic stimulation-induced spinal long-term potentiation of C-fiber-evoked field potentials. L-arginine, a substrate of nitric oxide synthase, completely reversed L-NAME-induced inhibition. However, D-NAME (1 mM, 20 microl), an inactive form of L-NAME, had little effect on the spinal LTP. (2) The same tetanic sciatic stimulation induced long-term thermal hyperalgesia, which was blocked by pre-application of L-NAME. These results suggest the involvement of nitric oxide in the spinal long-term potentiation of C-fiber-evoked field potentials and related behavior changes.",Excluded,0.086026885
4782,"Dual-Energy CT helps in head & neck cancer treatment planning Purpose: Our previous study had demonstrated that dual energy CT (DECT) provided advantageous features in cranial target delineation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical application of DECT for treatment planning of head & neck cancer. Method(s): A Siemens SOMATOM Definition AS (Open 20RT) was used in this study for treatment planning CT simulation of all head and neck patients since January 2018. The DECT scanner allowed for sequential acquisition of two image datasets at 80 kVp and 140 kVp with the same acquisition time and radiation dose as a conventional single-energy scan. Images were reconstructed for nominal monoenergies of 40 keV, 100 keV and 190 keV, and a mixed energy of 120 kVp, which is equivalent to that currently used in routine simulation scanning. The reconstructed images were compared using the Varian VelocityAI software with a focus on the anatomical appearance of the lymph nodes and primary tumor sites. Result(s): Our data showed that there were clinically significant differences in DECT images at different nominal energies. At 40 keV, enhancement of the tumor was more clearly seen compared with CT images at 120 kVp, 100 keV and 190 keV. More significant differences were also found at the border and necrotic area of nodes using different energies. For most patients the 40 keV CT images showed more enhanced tumor areas surrounding the vessels compared with images at 120 kVp, 100 keV and 190 keV, respectively. Conclusion(s): It was demonstrated that the appearance of the head & neck primary tumor and nodes was significantly different among CT images reconstructed at different monoenergies. Quantification of such differences is in progress with corresponding MR images to evaluate clinical significance. In order to contour the gross tumor volume and nodes accurately, MR imaging is recommended.",Excluded,0.08595553
4783,"Upconversion Nanoparticles-Based Multiplex Protein Activation to Neuron Ablation for Locomotion Regulation The optogenetic neuron ablation approach enables noninvasive remote decoding of specific neuron function within a complex living organism in high spatiotemporal resolution. However, it suffers from shallow tissue penetration of visible light with low ablation efficiency. This study reports a upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP)-based multiplex proteins activation tool to ablate deep-tissue neurons for locomotion modulation. By optimizing the dopant contents and nanoarchitecure, over 300-fold enhancement of blue (450-470 nm) and red (590-610 nm) emissions from UCNPs is achieved upon 808 nm irradiation. Such emissions simultaneously activate mini singlet oxygen generator and Chrimson, leading to boosted near infrared (NIR) light-induced neuronal ablation efficiency due to the synergism between singlet oxygen generation and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation. The loss of neurons severely inhibits reverse locomotion, revealing the instructive role of neurons in controlling motor activity. The deep penetrance NIR light makes the current system feasible for in vivo deep-tissue neuron elimination. The results not only provide a rapidly adoptable platform to efficient photoablate single- and multiple-cells, but also define the neural circuits underlying behavior, with potential for development of remote therapy in diseases.",Excluded,0.085859634
4784,"Surface-Based Falff: A Potential Novel Biomarker for Prediction of Radiation Encephalopathy in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Radiation encephalopathy (RE) is an important potential complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who undergo radiotherapy (RT) that can affect the quality of life. However, a functional imaging biomarker of pre-symptomatic RE has not yet been established. This study aimed to assess radiation-induced gray matter functional alterations and explore fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) as an imaging biomarker for predicting or diagnosing RE in patients with NPC. A total of 60 patients with NPC were examined, 21 in the pre-RT cohort and 39 in the post-RT cohort. Patients in the post-RT cohort were further divided into two subgroups according to the occurrence of RE in follow-up: post-RT <inf>non-RE</inf> (n = 21) and post-RT <inf>REproved</inf><inf>infollow-up</inf> (n = 18). Surface-based and volume-based fALFF were used to detect radiation-induced functional alterations. Functional derived features were then adopted to construct a predictive model for the diagnosis of RE. We observed that surface-based fALFF could sensitively detect radiation-induced functional alterations in the intratemporal brain regions (such as the hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus), as well as the extratemporal regions (such as the insula and prefrontal lobe); however, no significant intergroup differences were observed using volume-based fALFF. No significant correlation between fALFF and radiation dose to the ipsilateral temporal lobe was observed. Support vector machine (SVM) analysis revealed that surface-based fALFF in the bilateral superior temporal gyri and left insula exhibited impressive performance (accuracy = 80.49%) in identifying patients likely to develop RE. We conclude that surface-based fALFF may serve as a sensitive imaging biomarker in the prediction of RE. Â© Copyright Â© 2021 Zhang, Kang, Zeng, Li, Gao, Liu, Shi and Liao.",Included,0.9504316
4785,"Segmented TOF at 7T MRI: Technique and clinical applications Purpose: Time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography has an advantage of contrast and resolution in ultra-high field (7. T) MRI systems. However, increased specific absorption rate (SAR) prohibits the application of spatial saturation band, leading to venous contamination in maximum intensity projection (MIP) images. Method(s): A segmented k-space filling scheme with sparse venous saturation pulses was developed for 7. T TOF-MRA. The effectiveness of the segmented TOF sequence was verified by Bloch equation simulation and experiments on 3. T. The protocol on 7. T was optimized and applied for healthy volunteers and patients with vascular diseases. Result(s): Segmented TOF achieved equivalent contrast and venous suppression effect as conventional methods, while SAR values had a remarkable reduction and obeyed the limit of a 7. T MRI system. The decreased number of saturation pulses allowed shorter acquisition time than existing solutions. The comparison of segmented TOF and conventional TOF revealed flow direction in vascular diseases. Conclusion(s): Segmented TOF is proved to be a time-efficient way to achieve high-resolution angiograms without venous contamination at ultra-high field. The sequence holds strong promise for non-contrast clinical diagnosis on cerebrovascular diseases. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.08603029
4786,"A predictive model for distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumour progression after gamma knife radiosurgery based on radiomic features from MR images OBJECTIVES: To develop a model using radiomic features extracted from MR images to distinguish radiation necrosis from tumour progression in brain metastases after Gamma Knife radiosurgery.METHODS: We retrospectively identified 87 patients with pathologically confirmed necrosis (24 lesions) or progression (73 lesions) and calculated 285 radiomic features from four MR sequences (T1, T1 post-contrast, T2, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) obtained at two follow-up time points per lesion per patient. Reproducibility of each feature between the two time points was calculated within each group to identify a subset of features with distinct reproducible values between two groups. Changes in radiomic features from one time point to the next (delta radiomics) were used to build a model to classify necrosis and progression lesions.RESULTS: A combination of five radiomic features from both T1 post-contrast and T2 MR images were found to be useful in distinguishing necrosis from progression lesions. Delta radiomic features with a RUSBoost ensemble classifier had an overall predictive accuracy of 73.2% and an area under the curve value of 0.73 in leave-one-out cross-validation.CONCLUSIONS: Delta radiomic features extracted from MR images have potential for distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumour progression after radiosurgery for brain metastases.KEY POINTS: * Some radiomic features showed better reproducibility for progressive lesions than necrotic ones * Delta radiomic features can help to distinguish radiation necrosis from tumour progression * Delta radiomic features had better predictive value than did traditional radiomic features.",Excluded,0.11506834

4788,"Photoresponse diversity among the five types of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) mediate non-image-forming visual responses, including pupillary constriction, circadian photoentrainment and suppression of pineal melatonin secretion. Five morphological types of ipRGCs, M1-M5, have been identified in mice. In order to understand their functions better, we studied the photoresponses of all five cell types, by whole-cell recording from fluorescently labelled ipRGCs visualized using multiphoton microscopy. All ipRGC types generated melanopsin-based ('intrinsic') as well as synaptically driven ('extrinsic') light responses. The intrinsic photoresponses of M1 cells were lower threshold, higher amplitude and faster than those of M2-M5. The peak amplitudes of extrinsic light responses differed among the ipRGC types; however, the responses of all cell types had comparable thresholds, kinetics and waveforms, and all cells received rod input. While all five types exhibited inhibitory amacrine-cell and excitatory bipolar-cell inputs from the 'on' channel, M1 and M3 received additional 'off'-channel inhibition, possibly through their 'off'-sublamina dendrites. The M2-M5 ipRGCs had centre-surround-organized receptive fields, implicating a capacity to detect spatial contrast. In contrast, the receptive fields of M1 cells lacked surround antagonism, which might be caused by the surround of the inhibitory input nullifying the surround of the excitatory input. All ipRGCs responded robustly to a wide range of motion speeds, and M1-M4 cells appeared tuned to different speeds, suggesting that they might analyse the speed of motion. Retrograde labelling revealed that M1-M4 cells project to the superior colliculus, suggesting that the contrast and motion information signalled by these cells could be used by this sensorimotor area to detect novel objects and motion in the visual field.",Excluded,0.08611477

4790,"Changes in the readily releasable pool of transmitter and in efficacy of release induced by high-frequency firing at Aplysia sensorimotor synapses in culture Synaptic transmission at the sensory neuron-motor neuron synapses of Aplysia, like transmission at many synapses of both vertebrates and invertebrates, is increased after a short burst of high-frequency stimulation (HFS), a phenomenon known as posttetanic potentiation (PTP). PTP is generally attributable to an increase in transmitter release from presynaptic neurons. We investigated whether changes in the readily releasable pool of transmitter (RRP) contribute to the potentiation that follows HFS. We compared the changes in excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked with action potentials to changes in the RRP as estimated from the asynchronous transmitter release elicited by a hypertonic solution. The changes in the EPSP were correlated with changes in the RRP, but the changes matched quantitatively only at connections whose initial synaptic strength was greater than the median for all experiments. At weaker connections, the increase in the RRP was insufficient to account for PTP. Weaker connections initially released a smaller fraction of the RRP with each EPSP than stronger ones, and this fraction increased at weaker connections after HFS. Moreover, the initial transmitter release in response to the hypertonic solution was accelerated after HFS, indicating that the increase in the efficacy of release was not restricted to excitation-secretion coupling. Modulation of the RRP and of the efficacy of release thus both contribute to the enhancement of transmitter release by HFS.",Excluded,0.08643679

However, relevant real-world data in patients with baseline brain metastasis (BM) as well as the clinical value of upfront cranial local therapy (CLT) remain scarce. Method(s): Untreated EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with BMs receiving first-line Osimertinib or first-generation EGFR-TKIs at our cancer center were retrospectively enrolled. Progression-free survival (PFS), intracranial PFS (iPFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated in the entire cohort and patient groups created by propensity score matching (PSM). Survival outcomes and pattern of treatment failure were also investigated in patient subgroups stratified by the status of BMs, which was classified as oligo-BM (number<=3 and size<=3cm) and multiple-BM (number>=4 or size>3cm). Result(s): Among the 362 patients enrolled, 265 received first-generation EGFR-TKIs (Gefitinib=196, Erlotinib=69) and the rest 97 received Osimertinib. Patients receiving first-line Osimertinib had more (p<0.001) and larger BMs (p=0.011) than those receiving first-generation EGFR-TKIs. With a median follow-up of 17.1 months (range, 2.6-73 months), median PFS and OS was 14.6 months and 31 months, respectively. Patient groups (Osimertinib=97, first-generation group=97) were created by PSM with balanced clinic-pathological parameters, and iPFS (32.5 vs 8.4 months, p<0.001), PFS (34.7 vs 11.5months,p<0.001) and OS (40.6 vs 23.8 months, p=0.041) were significantly longer in the Osimertinib group (Figure a-c). Upfront CLT, including surgery, whole brain radiotherapy and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS), was performed in 129 patients before disease progression and it prolonged iPFS and PFS, but not OS, in the entire cohort. Among patients with baseline oligo-BMs (n=195), upfront CLT (dominated by SRS) improved iPFS (HR=0.443, p=0.001), PFS (HR=0.373, p<0.001) and OS (HR=0.795, p=0.035) (Figure d-f), which was not the case among patients with baseline multiple-BMs. Pattern of failure analyses indicated that more patients with baseline multiple-BMs turned into the status of oligo-BMs at the maximal response to EGFR-TKIs (p=0.023) and less patients developed progressive disease in the central nervous system (p=0.019) among patients receiving upfront CTL than those didn't. Of note, 8 patients with oligo-BMs but didn't receive upfront CLT developed multiple progressive disease in the brain. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world study with considerable sample size verifying the superior efficacy of first-line Osimertinib treatment in EGFR-mutant NSCLC with BMs. Additionally, upfront brain SRS was recommended for those with oligo-BMs. Keywords: Brain metastasis, osimertinib, cranial radiotherapy Copyright Â© 2021",Excluded,0.54431

4798,"Postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery for resected brain metastases: A comparison of outcomes for large resection cavities PURPOSE: Although historical trials have established the role of surgical resection followed by whole brain irradiation (WBRT) for brain metastases, WBRT has recently been shown to cause significant neurocognitive decline. Many practitioners have employed postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to tumor resection cavities to increase local control without causing significant neurocognitive sequelae. However, studies analyzing outcomes of large brain metastases treated with resection and postoperative SRS are lacking. Here we compare outcomes in patients with large brain metastases >4 cm to those with smaller metastases <=4 cm treated with surgical resection followed by SRS to the resection cavity.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Consecutive patients with brain metastases treated at our institution with surgical resection and postoperative SRS were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified into <=4 cm and >4 cm cohorts based on preoperative maximal tumor dimension. Cumulative incidence of local failure, radiation necrosis, and death were analyzed for the 2 cohorts using a competing-risk model, defined as the time from SRS treatment date to the measured event, death, or last follow-up.RESULTS: A total of 117 consecutive cases were identified. Of these patients, 90 (77%) had preoperative tumors <=4 cm, and 27 (23%) >4 cm in greatest dimension. The only significant baseline difference between the 2 groups was a higher proportion of patients who underwent gross total resection in the <=4 cm compared with the >4 cm cohort, 76% versus 48%, respectively (P <.01). The 1-year rates of local failure, radiation necrosis, and overall survival for the <=4 cm and >4 cm cohorts were 12.3% and 16.0%, 26.9% and 28.4%, and 80.6% and 67.6%, respectively (all P >.05). The rates of local failure and radiation necrosis were not statistically different on multivariable analysis based on tumor size.CONCLUSIONS: Brain metastases >4 cm in largest dimension managed by resection and radiosurgery to the tumor cavity have promising local control rates without a significant increase in radiation necrosis on our retrospective review.",Excluded,0.893587
4799,"Dominant frequency uncertainty analysis of EEG alpha activity in pilots with transient ischemic attacks Objective . To study the characteristics of EEG after transient ischemic attack and to offer reference for screening procedure of aircrew and astronaut selection. Method. The dominant frequency uncertainty of alpha band EEG in 12 pilots (males; age 30 +/- 5) with transient ischemic episodes in middle cerebral artery (MCA) territories and in 20 normal healthy pilots was analyzed with frequency-fluctuation analysis. Result. The dominant probability of the main frequency coinciding with sites affected by transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patient pilots was higher than that in healthy pilots (P<0.01), and the dominant probability ratio logarithmic index I >or= 0 in all patient pilots with normal EEG, but I<0 in all healthy pilots. It was also found that not only I >or= 0, but the second component shifted to lower frequency (8 Hz) in patients with slight focal EEG alterations, i.e. slowing of frequency. The relative entropy values (percentage) were decreased significantly in pilots with TIA as compared with healthy pilots (P<0.05). Conclusion . The dominant frequency uncertainty analysis of alpha band showed clear superiority of computerized evaluation over routine visual assessment for the diagnosis of minor cerebral ischemia. It offers not only a possibility of studying pathophysiological functional parameter, but also the reference for screening procedure in aircrew and astronaut selection.",Excluded,0.12381699
4800,"Differentiation between glioma and radiation necrosis using molecular magnetic resonance imaging of endogenous proteins and peptides It remains difficult to distinguish tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis after brain tumor therapy. Here we show that these lesions can be distinguished using the amide proton transfer (APT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals of endogenous cellular proteins and peptides as an imaging biomarker. When comparing two models of orthotopic glioma (SF188/V+ glioma and 9L gliosarcoma) with a model of radiation necrosis in rats, we could clearly differentiate viable glioma (hyperintense) from radiation necrosis (hypointense to isointense) by APT MRI. When we irradiated rats with U87MG gliomas, the APT signals in the irradiated tumors had decreased substantially by 3 d and 6 d after radiation. The amide protons that can be detected by APT provide a unique and noninvasive MRI biomarker for distinguishing viable malignancy from radiation necrosis and predicting tumor response to therapy.",Excluded,0.19868754

4802,Irradiated normal brain promotes invasion of glioblastoma through vascular endothelial growth and stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha The significance of irradiated normal brain volume in glioma recurrence is usually ignored by radiotherapists. The whole-brain irradiation (WBI) of 15 Gy in three fractions was delivered to C57BL/6 mice before implantation of GL261 glioma cells. The changes in vascular endothelial growth (VEGF) and stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) after WBI were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Cell invasion assays were performed to study the effects of VEGF and SDF-1alpha. The levels of VEGF and SDF-1alpha in normal brain tissues increased after 15 Gy WBI. The WBI before tumor implantation significantly increased the invasive ability of GL261 cells. VEGF and SDF-1alpha could promote invasion of GL261 cells even after high-dose irradiation. The combination of irradiation and inhibitors such as AMD3100 may prevent irradiation-stimulated dissemination of glioma cells.,Included,0.98401123
4803,"The dual-peak light response of ganglion cells in chicken retina In the present study, a particular temporal pattern of the ganglion cells' light response specified as ""dual-peak"" was observed. In the chicken retina (N=15), about 37.5% (174 out of 464) of the ganglion cells showed such special temporal property in response to the onset of light flash. These neurons responded to light stimulus with two successive components: a transient increase of firing rate which lasted for less than 100 ms, and another prolonged light response appeared in about 100 ms after the first transient response. Moreover, our data demonstrated a temporal adaptation process in the later phase of firing activities when repeated flashes were applied. Meanwhile, the earlier phase had a more stable latency in response to the stimulus. Application of picrotoxin could evoke the dual-peak responses in transient ganglion cells. These results suggest that the origination of the two response components might be distinct and the later one is likely related to GABAergic pathways.",Excluded,0.08693407

To understand the neural mechanisms underlying these physiological and psychological changes, it is critical to investigate the effects of microgravity on the functional architecture of the brain. In this study, we used resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to study whether the functional architecture of the brain is altered after 45 days of -6degree head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest, which is a reliable model for the simulation of microgravity. Sixteen healthy male volunteers underwent rs-fMRI scans before and after 45 days of -6degree HDT bed rest. Specifically, we used a commonly employed graph-based measure of network organization, i.e., degree centrality (DC), to perform a full-brain exploration of the regions that were influenced by simulated microgravity. We subsequently examined the functional connectivities of these regions using a seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis. We found decreased DC in two regions, the left anterior insula (aINS) and the anterior part of the middle cingulate cortex (MCC; also called the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in many studies), in the male volunteers after 45 days of -6degree HDT bed rest. Furthermore, seed-based RSFC analyses revealed that a functional network anchored in the aINS and MCC was particularly influenced by simulated microgravity.

Patients and Methods: Between January 2003 and December 2009, the records of completely resected patients who were diagnosed with SCLC and definitive pTNM stage on the basis of histological proof were reviewed. According to the therapy modality, patients were allocated to PCI group and non-PCI group. Result(s): A total of 193 patients were finally included, 67 patients in PCI group and 126 in non-PCI group. The OS rates at 2-year and 5-year in PCI group were 92.5%, and 54.9%, respectively, and those of non-PCI were 63.2% and 47.8%, respectively (. p=. 0.005).

4807,"Targeting the NF-E2-related factor 2 pathway: A novel strategy for glioblastoma (Review) Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant subtype among all brain tumors. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an essential component of cellular defense against a variety of endogenous and exogenous stresses. A marked increase in research over the past few decades focusing on Nrf2 and its role in regulating glioblastoma has revealed the potential value of Nrf2 in the treatment of glioblastoma. In the present review, we discuss a novel framework of Nrf2 in the regulation of glioblastoma and the mechanisms regarding the downregulation of Nrf2 in treating glioblastoma. The candidate mechanisms include direct and indirect means. Direct mechanisms target tumor molecular pathways in order to overcome resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, to inhibit proliferation, to block invasion and migration, to induce apoptosis, to promote differentiation, to enhance autophagy and to target glioblastoma stem cells. Indirect mechanisms target the reaction between glioblastoma cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Overall, the value of the Nrf2 pathway in glioblastoma provides a promising opportunity for new approaches by which to treat glioblastoma.",Excluded,0.085783176
4808,"Radiotherapy in Combination with Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapy Is a Safe and Promising Approach in Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma Patients with High Tumor Burden Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy (RT) for localized-refractory or relapsed (R/R) DLBCL after chemotherapy is a standard therapy. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) therapy is demonstrated as a novel immunotherapy modality with impressive efficacy in R/R B-cell malignancies including DLBCL. However, CAR-T therapy is also associated with potentially fatal toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurological toxicities. Whether radiotherapy in combination with CAR-T is a better approach to enhancing efficacy and decreasing toxicity of CAR-T therapy in R/R DLBCL patients with high tumor burden remains unknown. Materials/Methods: Human CD3+T cells were separated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMS) of patients or donors by degradable anti-CD3 magnetic microbeads followed by 24h stimulation with CD3 and CD28 monoclonal antibody (5ug/ml). Then CD3+T cells were transduced with humanized CAR construct targeting CD19, CD20 and CD22 and further expanded for 7 to 10 days in vitro. 14 patients with high tumor burden R/R DLBCL were enrolled in the study. Patients from 39 to 66 years of age had received two to four prior lines of therapy. 7 patients received intensive second-line chemotherapy (median age, 46 years) and 7 received radiotherapy (median age, 63 years) to debulking tumor after leukapheresis and during CAR-T cells preparation. Intensive combined chemotherapy or radiation (40 Gy in 20 fractions) were carried out for debulking condition after sequential FC regimen (cyclophosphamide 300mg/m<sup>2</sup> and fludarabine 30mg/m<sup>2</sup> X 3d) for lymphodepletion chemotherapy. Two days after FC regimen, CAR-T cells targeting CD19 and CD20 or CD22 at average dose of 1-2x10<sup>7</sup> cells for each target per kilogram (kg) were infused within 3 days. Result(s): Severe CRS (grade 3/4/5) was reported in all patients of chemotherapy cohort and mild CRS (grade 1/2) was reported in all patients of radiation cohort. 4 patients (57.1%) in chemotherapy cohort showed neurological toxicity while no patient in radiation cohort showed neurological toxicity. Comparable hematological/non-hematological toxicity and non-neurological toxicity were observed in both two groups. In chemotherapy cohort, four of seven (57.1%) patients achieved an objective response after CAR-T infusion with three of seven (42.9%) achieving a CR. In radiation cohort, seven of seven (100%) achieved an objective response after CAR-T therapy with four of seven (57.1%) achieving a CR. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that compared to intensive second-line chemotherapy, radiation is a better approach with enhanced efficacy and decreased toxicity of CAR-T therapy in R/R DLBCL patients with high tumor burden. Radiotherapy in combination with CAR-T cell infusion may be the optimal alternative treatment model of R/R DLBCL with high tumor burden. Copyright Â© 2019",Excluded,0.14805964
4809,"Nucleus- and species-specific properties of the slow (<1 Hz) sleep oscillation in thalamocortical neurons The slow (<1 Hz) rhythm is an electroencephalogram hallmark of resting sleep. In thalamocortical neurons this rhythm correlates with a slow (<1 Hz) oscillation comprising recurring UP and DOWN membrane potential states. Recently, we showed that metabotropic glutamate receptor activation brings about an intrinsic slow oscillation in thalamocortical neurons of the cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in vitro which is identical to that observed in vivo. The aim of this study was to further assess the properties of this oscillation and compare them with those observed in thalamocortical neurons of three other thalamic nuclei in the cat (ventrobasal complex, medial geniculate body; ventral lateral nucleus) and two thalamic nuclei in rats and mice (lateral geniculate nucleus and ventrobasal complex). Slow oscillations were evident in all of these additional structures and shared several basic properties including, i) the stereotypical, rhythmic alternation between distinct UP and DOWN states with the UP state always commencing with a low-threshold Ca2+ potential, and ii) an inverse relationship between frequency and injected current so that slow oscillations always increase in frequency with hyperpolarization, often culminating in delta (delta) activity at approximately 1-4 Hz. However, beyond these common properties there were important differences in expression between different nuclei. Most notably, 44% of slow oscillations in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus possessed UP states that comprised sustained tonic firing and/or high-threshold bursting. In contrast, slow oscillations in cat ventrobasal complex, medial geniculate body and ventral lateral nucleus thalamocortical neurons exhibited such UP states in only 16%, 11% and 10% of cases, respectively, whereas slow oscillations in the lateral geniculate nucleus and ventrobasal complex of rats and mice did so in <12% of cases. Thus, the slow oscillation is a common feature of thalamocortical neurons that displays clear species- and nuclei-related differences.

4810,"Establishment and Characteristic Analysis of a Dog Model for Autologous Homologous Cranioplasty Objective. The aim of this study is to establish a large animal (dog) model that can be referred clinically for autologous homologous cranioplasty. Methods. Our large skull defect dog model was established by emulating the decompressive craniectomy with 22 adult beagle dogs. The autologous bones were taken out from the dogs and divided into two groups, the freeze-drying (FD) group and the single freezing (SF) group. They were then stored in the bone bank at-20degreeC after being irradiated with 25 KGy. Three months later, the bones were reimplanted. After operation, we closely watch the experimental objects for four more months examining the infection and survival of the bone graft. Results. Through macroscopic observation, it was found that, among 44 cranial flaps (bilateral) from the rest of the 22 dogs, grade A cranial flaps accounted for 86.4% (19/22) in the SF group and only 31.8% (7/22) in the FD group. Although osteogenic osteoclast, Harvard tube, neovascularization, and angiogenic factors were found through the pathological results, including an electron microscope and calmodulin tracer, it could be verified by using X-CT and micro-CT that early bone resorption could be still found even in grade A bone flap. Conclusion. By using the common clinical method to preserve the cranial flaps, we established an experimental dog model of autologous cranioplasty for a large area of cranial defect. It was proved that this model could reproduce the infections and bone resorption which typically happened in clinical autologous homologous cranioplasty. As a conclusion, the established model can be used as an effective experimental tool for further research to improve the success rate of autologous homologous cranioplasty.

4811,"Auditory efferent feedback system deficits precede age-related hearing loss: contralateral suppression of otoacoustic emissions in mice The C57BL/6J mouse has been a useful model of presbycusis, as it displays an accelerated age-related peripheral hearing loss. The medial olivocochlear efferent feedback (MOC) system plays a role in suppressing cochlear outer hair cell (OHC) responses, particularly for background noise. Neurons of the MOC system are located in the superior olivary complex, particularly in the dorsomedial periolivary nucleus (DMPO) and in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB). We previously discovered that the function of the MOC system declines with age prior to OHC degeneration, as measured by contralateral suppression (CS) of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in humans and CBA mice. The present study aimed to determine the time course of age changes in MOC function in C57s. DPOAE amplitudes and CS of DPOAEs were collected for C57s from 6 to 40 weeks of age. MOC responses were observed at 6 weeks but were gone at middle (15-30 kHz) and high (30-45 kHz) frequencies by 8 weeks. Quantitative stereological analyses of Nissl sections revealed smaller neurons in the DMPO and VNTB of young adult C57s compared with CBAs. These findings suggest that reduced neuron size may underlie part of the noteworthy rapid decline of the C57 efferent system. In conclusion, the C57 mouse has MOC function at 6 weeks, but it declines quickly, preceding the progression of peripheral age-related sensitivity deficits and hearing loss in this mouse strain.",Excluded,0.4753569
4812,"Environmental damage to the retina and preconditioning: contrasting effects of light and hyperoxic stress PURPOSE: Environmental stress (bright light, hypoxia) can ""condition"" retinal photoreceptors, increasing their resistance to subsequent stress. The present study tests whether another photoreceptor-lethal stress, hyperoxia, can induce similar resistance.METHODS: Vulnerability to hyperoxia was tested in young adult C57BL/6J mice exposed to 1000 lux cyclic light for 1 week or to 50% O2 for 1 week and then to 75% O2 for 2 weeks. Vulnerability to light was tested in Balb/cJ mice exposed to 300 lux cyclic light for 2 days or to 75% O2 for 2 weeks and then to 1000 lux cyclic light for 1 week. Retinas were analyzed for photoreceptor death, levels of stress-related proteins (GFAP, FGF-2, MnSOD, acrolein), and the regulation of candidate neuroprotective genes (HSP70.1, Ledgf, FGF-13, Timp2).RESULTS: Light preconditioning did not cause measurable death of photoreceptors but reduced photoreceptor death induced by subsequent hyperoxic or light stress, reduced levels of stress-related proteins, and maintained the length and organization of photoreceptor outer segments. Hyperoxic preconditioning caused measurable cell death but provided no protection against subsequent hyperoxic or light stress. Of the four candidate neuroprotective proteins examined, the regulation of only one (Timp2) seemed associated with the neuroprotection observed.CONCLUSIONS: Light preconditioning, causing only minimal damage to photoreceptors, induced protection against subsequent stress from both hyperoxia and light. By contrast, hyperoxic preconditioning caused measurable photoreceptor damage but induced no protection against light or hyperoxia. These data suggest a separation between stress-induced damage to photoreceptors and the upregulation of protective mechanisms, encouraging the search for ways to protect the retina without damaging it.",Excluded,0.09079967

Method(s): 13 patients with rNPC were replanned for FFF RapidArc<sup>-></sup> (RA-FFF) and conventional RapidArc (RA) (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Quantitative evaluation was performed for the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs). Phantom dose verifications, treatment delivery time and monitor units (MUs) were also assessed. Result(s): Each technique delivered similar doses to the PTV. RA-FFF had a better sparing effect on the brain stem and normal tissue when compared with RA, whereas RA provided lower mean doses to the skin. No significant difference between the two techniques could be established for other OAR parameters. Both techniques showed equally good gamma scores in dosimetric verification. RAFFF required more MUs than RA, whereas the delivery time for RA-FFF was slightly shorter than for RA. Conclusion(s): Both treatment plans met the planning objectives. Dose measurements also showed good agreement with computed doses. In addition to slightly faster delivery times, RA-FFF produced better sparing of brain stem and normal tissue with uncompromised target coverage compared with RA. Advances in knowledge: FFF beams have recently been assembled for clinical use. Our findings show RA-FFF is useful in the salvage treatment of rNPC owing to better brain stem and normal tissue sparing with uncompromised target coverage compared with RA.

Histology revealed mild atherosclerosis, necrotizing vasculitis, and occlusive thrombosis of the internal carotid artery. Significant changes were observed in the vasa vasorum: swelling and detachment of the endothelium, subendothelial oedema, hyaline change, fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls with mononuclear cellular infiltration, accompanied by focal haemorrhages and chronic inflammation in the periadventitial soft tissue. We believe that these changes of the vasa vasorum and necrotizing vasculitis are causally related and that vasculitis represents focal ischaemic necroses with inflammatory reaction. Our findings support the hypothesis, based on experimental studies, that injury to the vasa vasorum is an important mechanism in the development of radiation-induced vasculopathy of large arteries. They also suggest an evolution of the injury to the vasa vasorum and periadventitial tissue from the early lesions described in our patient, to late stages resulting in dense periadventitial fibrosis as reported previously.

In desert locusts, the angle of polarized light in the zenith above the animal and the direction of a simulated sun are represented in a compass-like fashion in the central complex, but how both compasses fit together for a unified representation of external space remained unclear. To address this question, we analyzed the sensitivity of intracellularly recorded central-complex neurons to the angle of polarized light presented from up to 33 positions in the animal's dorsal visual field and injected Neurobiotin tracer for cell identification. Neurons were polarization sensitive in large parts of the virtual sky that in some cells extended to the horizon in all directions. Neurons, moreover, were tuned to spatial patterns of polarization angles that matched the sky polarization pattern of particular sun positions. The horizontal components of these calculated solar positions were topographically encoded in the protocerebral bridge of the central complex covering 360degree of space. This whole-sky polarization compass does not support the earlier reported polarization compass based on stimulation from a small spot above the animal but coincides well with the previously demonstrated direct sun compass based on unpolarized light stimulation. Therefore, direct sunlight and whole-sky polarization complement each other for robust head direction coding in the locust central complex.",Excluded,0.085853614
4820,"Ataxia-telangiectasia: a variant with altered in vitro phenotype of fibroblast cells The clinical and cellular phenotype of ataxia telangiectasia (AT) has been extensively documented in numerous patients of different ethnic groups and is characterized by several specific laboratory hallmarks, such as chromosomal instability, profound radiosensitivity and radioresistant DNA synthesis. Several recent reports have, however, shown variations on this theme. This article describes 2 Turkish siblings with AT, who showed a typical but somewhat more prolonged clinical course of the disease and altered characteristics of fibroblast cells, compared to the 'classical' AT cellular phenotype. Fibroblast strains derived from these patients showed a normal cellular life span, moderate degrees of chromosomal instability and sensitivity to the lethal effects of X-rays and neocarzinostatin, and lack of radioresistant DNA synthesis. A compilation of the literature on 'AT variants' and 'AT-like' syndromes shows that in addition to the internal variability of AT, this disease occupies a limited segment within a large spectrum of clinical and cellular features, which are common to a variety of syndromes. Each of these syndromes covers a different segment in this spectrum. The genetic basis of this family of disorders might be complex.",Excluded,0.086210944

4825,"Hemoptysis in a young patient: An unusual cause INTRODUCTION: Carcinoid tumors belong to the group of neuroendocrine tumors whose cells are part of the APUD system, with the place of origin being most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract (more often the appendix). Pulmonary involvement can be seen in about 0.5 % to 2% with no difference between gender, usually in patients above 60 years old, with no correlation with smoking, radiation or chemicals. It may have prognostic variables, from the kindness of a tumor without local infiltration to metastatic and life threatening tumors. CASE PRESENTATION: MAS, male, 25 years old, resident of interior of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, workman. Six years before our first consultation, the patient presented minor bleeding with probable origin in the respiratory tract, considered initially a nasal origin. Sporadic, with no relation to climate change, physical exertion or other triggering factors. Denied other signs or symptoms. Was requested chest and sinus radiography, without alterations. Requested a CT of the chest which showed consolidation with aerobronchograms located in the apical and anterior segment of the left lower lobe. Laboratory tests without relevant findings, with negative bacillus alcohol acid resistant, culture for M. tuberculosis in sputum and serum tests for fungi. We opted for conservative treatment. Two years after the initial event, he searched pulmonology service for monitoring, and it was requested new chest CT, which showed nodule with partial bronchial obstruction and onset of the consolidation in the adjacent parenchyma. Again, the position assumed was to maintain observation of the evolution of the framework due to the absence of clinical expression. Elapsed two more years, he presented episodes of bleeding associated with cough and sneezing, more intensely. Searched otolaryngologist who requested laryngoscopy, which showed no abnormalities that could justify the symptoms. He was then referred to our clinic and brought all previously obtained material, including a new request of chest CT. He referred hemoptoics, progressive dyspnea and wheezing. Denied fever, purulent sputum expectoration, weight loss or other constitutional symptoms. Ordered additional tests including ESR (51mm ), DHL (217 UI/L), PCR (26mm ) , CEA (1.4 ng / dL), negative serology for fungi, noreactive Mantoux test. Pulmonary function tests: FVC: 2.36(46%)-2.43(47% )-(change 3%), FEV<inf>1</inf>:1.59(37%)-1.83 (43 %)-(change15%), FEV<inf>1</inf>/FVC:67% - 75%, DLCO 23,8( 1%). The previously requested tomography brought showed nodule of 3.9 cm in the left lower lobe with soft tissue attenuation, promoting partial bronchial obstruction and leading to areas of adjacent consolidation. With these results, it was requested bronchoscopy. Evolved unfavorably with intensification of the bleeding, which made us chose hospitalization for monitoring. Bronchoscopy revealed tumor mass partially obstructing the left lower lobe bronchus, infiltratating with bleeding lips. Before the results of the histopathological analysis, he evolved with intensified bleeding, with risk of death.Referred to thoracic surgery. Performed left lower lobectomy, which was uneventful and he had complete recovery. The analysis of material obtained through fiberoptic bronchoscopy as part of the surgery proved to be a typical carcinoid tumor. DISCUSSION: Carcinoid tumors represent 1% to 2 % of cancers affecting the lung, with higher incidence in age above 60 years. Presents an indolent growth and may remain asymptomatic for several years, with the first manifestations being the presence of hemoptysis and dyspnea.It can produce metastasis, leading to carcinoid syndrome, characterized by a systemic clinical picture. For diagnosis it should take into account the correlation of imaging tests and biopsy either via endoscopic or thoracotomy, depending on the location of the tumor or the physician's choice. The curative treatment is done surgically with resection of the tumor. CONCLUSION(S): Pulmonary carcinoid tumors are rare and should be part of the differential diagnosis of lung neoplasms with nonspecific manifestations. When diagnosed, it has a favorable prognosis. The treatment of choice is surgical resection.",Excluded,0.08787696
4826,"The effects of 860 MHz radiofrequency radiation on the induction or promotion of brain tumors and other neoplasms in rats Sprague-Dawley rats were irradiated with a continuous-wave (CW) or a pulsed-wave (P) radiofrequency (RF) for 6 h/day, 5 days/week from 2 up to 24 months of age. The RFs emanated from dipole antennas (1 W average output) 2.0 +/- 0.5 cm from the tip of each rat's nose. The RFs had an 860 MHz frequency, and the specific absorption rate was 1.0 W/ kg averaged over the brain. Fifteen groups of 60 rats (900 total) were formed from offspring of females injected i.v. with 0 (groups 1, 2, 9, 10, 13), 2.5 (groups 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14) or 10 mg/kg (groups 3, 4, 15) ethylnitrosourea (ENU) to induce brain tumors. Groups 1, 3, 5 and 7 received the PRF, and groups 9 and 11 the CWRF; groups 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 were sham-irradiated, and groups 13-15 were cage controls. All rats but 2, totaling 898, were necropsied, and major tissues were studied histopathologically. There was no statistically significant evidence that the PRF or CWRF induced neoplasia in any tissues. Additionally, there was no significant evidence of promotion of cranial or spinal nerve or spinal cord tumors. The PRF or CWRF had no statistically significant effect on the number, volume, location, multiplicity, histological type, malignancy or fatality of brain tumors. There was a trend for the group that received a high dose of ENU and was exposed to the PRF to develop fatal brain tumors at a higher rate than its sham group; however, the result was not significant using the log-rank test (P = 0.14, 2-tailed). No statistically significant differences were related to the PRF or CWRF compared to controls in the low- or zero-dose groups regarding tumors of any kind.

4827,"Angiographic features, collaterals, and infarct topography of symptomatic occlusive radiation vasculopathy: a case-referent study BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Occlusive radiation vasculopathy (ORV) predisposes head-and-neck cancer survivors to ischemic strokes.METHODS: We analyzed the digital subtraction angiography acquired in 96 patients who had first-ever transient ischemic attack or ischemic strokes attributed to ORV. Another age-matched 115 patients who had no radiotherapy but symptomatic high-grade (>70%) carotid stenoses were enrolled as referent subjects. Digital subtraction angiography was performed within 2 months from stroke onset and delineated carotid and vertebrobasilar circulations from aortic arch up to intracranial branches. Two reviewers blinded to group assignment recorded all vascular lesions, collateral status, and infarct pattern.RESULTS: ORV patients had less atherosclerotic risk factors at presentation. In referent patients, high-grade stenoses were mostly focal at the proximal internal carotid artery. In contrast, high-grade ORV lesions diffusely involved the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery and were more frequently bilateral (54% versus 22%), tandem (23% versus 10%), associated with complete occlusion in one or both carotid arteries (30% versus 9%), vertebral artery (VA) steno-occlusions (28% versus 16%), and external carotid artery stenosis (19% versus 5%) (all P<0.05). With comparable rates of vascular anomaly, ORV patients showed more established collateral circulations through leptomeningeal arteries, anterior communicating artery, posterior communicating artery, suboccipital/costocervical artery, and retrograde flow in ophthalmic artery. In terms of infarct topography, the frequencies of cortical or subcortical watershed infarcts were similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: ORV angiographic features and corresponding collaterals are distinct from atherosclerotic patterns at initial stroke presentation. Clinical decompensation, despite more extensive collateralization, may precipitate stroke in ORV.",Included,0.8453575
4828,"The characteristics of cerebrovascular disorders in persons exposed to the effect of ionizing radiation as a result of the accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Station. [Ukrainian] Small doses of radioactive irradiation were found to be associated with damage to all levels of the nervous system, as evidenced by cliniconeurological investigations. But regulatory functions and vascular system get it most of all. Commonly seen in the sample was vegetovascular dystonia, also revealed were a varying degree discirculatory encephalopathy, acute disturbances in cerebral circulation, dyscirculatory myelopathy. Vascular abnormalities may develop at any age but in young adulthood they tend to occur more frequently. Clinical manifestations of vegetovascular dystonia were characterized by profound mixed type vegetative crises. Even if treated, vegetovascular dystonia tends to acquire remittent-and-progredient course leading to decompensation very soon. Strokes run atypical course: hemorrhages occur more often than not; circulatory disorders come about against the background of normal arterial blood pressure or insignificant its fluctuations. Hemorrhage may run gradually progressing course, which fact makes their diagnosis very difficult even with modern techniques being involved in relevent studies. It is not infrequently that carotid angiography does not find any structural-and-morphologic changes in the main vessels. A separate nozologic form, viz. that of discirculatory encephalopacy due to radiative irradiation, is suggested, as an entity worth introducing into the medical nomenclature.",Included,0.9603691

4830,"Patient dosimetric evaluation in angiography practice: Application in interventional neuroradiology Purpose: To evaluate the risk of a deterministic skin injury from Interventional Radiology (IR) procedures, the Peak Skin Dose (PSD) and the skin dose mapping should be estimate. Dose metrics commonly available such as cumulative air kerma at the interventional reference point (Ka,irp) are usually employed. However, as the PSD may be substantially different from Ka,irp, it is necessary to estimate the PSD and skin dose mapping more accurately. Material(s) and Method(s): A custom made MatLab code has been developed; its output is the PSD and a visual display of the surface dose mapped onto a spherical or cylindrical phantom modeling the head or the trunk of the patient respectively. The code works by translating the Ka,irp (corrected by back-scatter factor) to the location of the patient's skin, represented by a surface of the geometrical model and using dosimetric and geometric parameters (primary and secondary angles of the two tubes, longitudinal displacement of the bed) for each radiation event stored in the radiation dose structured report (RDSR). The setting of the dimension of the geometrical phantom depends on the anatomical size of the patient measured from images stored during IR procedures. To validate the code, arrays of thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were placed on the phantom surface and on the skin of 9 patients undergoing neuroendovascular treatments, both cerebral and spinal (Artis zee biplane, Siemens). Result(s): The Ka,irp provided by the Angiography System overestimates the measured PSD by more than 50% for head treatments. The percent difference between the PSD calculated and measured by TLD is within 35%. The skin dose mapped on the surface of the geometrical model is in agreement with the dose distribution measured by TLD. Conclusion(s): In Neuro-IR, the use of more detailed information from RDSR can improve the accuracy of the calculated PSD. The implemented algorithm can be applied to evaluate the PSD and skin dose mapping without direct dosimetry. Copyright Â© 2016",Excluded,0.08620536

4835,"Cortical activation with deep brain stimulation of the anterior thalamus for epilepsy OBJECTIVE: We studied the relation between thalamic stimulation parameters and the morphology, topographic distribution and cortical sources of the cerebral responses in patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus.METHODS: Bipolar and monopolar stimuli were delivered at a rate of 2 Hz to the anterior (AN, four patients), the dorsomedian (DM, four patients), and the centromedian nucleus (CM, one patient) using the programmable stimulation device (Medtronic ITREL II). Source modeling was carried out by using statistical non-parametric mapping of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) values.RESULTS: All patients demonstrated reproducible time-locked cortical responses (CRs) consisting of a sequence of components with latencies between 20 and 320 ms. The morphology of these CRs, however, was very heterogeneous, depending primarily on the site of stimulation. Following AN stimulation, cortical activation was most prominent in ipsilateral cingulate gyrus, insular cortex and lateral neocortical temporal structures. Stimulation of the DM mainly showed activation of the ipsilateral orbitofrontal and mesial and lateral frontal areas, but also involvement of mesial temporal structures. Stimulation of the CM showed a rather diffuse (though still mainly ipsilateral) increase of cortical activity. The magnitude of cortical activation was positively related to the strength of the stimulus and inversely related to the impedance of the electrode.CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of cortical activation corresponded with the hodology of the involved structures and may underscore the importance of optimal localization of DBS electrodes in patients with epilepsy.SIGNIFICANCE: The method of analyzing sources of CRs could potentially be a useful tool for titration of DBS parameters in patients with electrode contacts in clinically silent areas. Furthermore, the inverse relation of the cortical activation and the impedance of the electrode contacts might suggest that these impedance measurements should be taken into consideration when adjusting DBS parameters in patients with epilepsy.",Excluded,0.08602895

Changes in the morphological structure, cell viability, apoptosis rate, and expression of apoptosis-related protein induced by exposure to a power frequency electromagnetic field (PF-MF; 50 Hz, 100 muT, 24 h) were detected respectively by light and electron microscopy, the MTT assay, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The results showed that 3-12 h after PF-MF exposure, the pathological injury was improved partly; metabolic activity was promoted and cell apoptosis was inhibited in the AD neuronal model. In addition, PF-MF exposure significantly inhibited the expression of Caspase8, Caspase3, and CytC, but increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio of the AD neuronal model. Meanwhile, PF-MF seemed to have no effect on the expression of Fas and TNFR1.
