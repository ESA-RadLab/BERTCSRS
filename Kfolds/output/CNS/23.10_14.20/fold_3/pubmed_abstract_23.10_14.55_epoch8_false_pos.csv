957,Low Dose Brain Irradiation Reduces Amyloid-beta and Tau in 3xTg-AD Mice We have previously reported that low doses of external beam ionizing irradiation reduced amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and improved cognition in APP/PS1 mice. In this study we investigated the effects of radiation in an age-matched series of 3xTg-AD mice. Mice were hemibrain-irradiated with 5 fractions of 2 Gy and sacrificed 8 weeks after the end of treatment. Abeta and tau were assessed using immunohistochemistry and quantified using image analysis with Definiens Tissue Studio. We observed a significant reduction in Abeta plaque burden and tau staining; these two parameters were significantly correlated. This preliminary data is further support that low doses of radiation may be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease.,Excluded,0.9843866
178,Effects of prenatal ionizing irradiation on the development of the ganglion cell layer of the mouse retina Prenatal exposure to ionizing irradiation has been shown to be an effective method to eliminate selectively certain neuronal population. This investigation studied the effects on the ganglion cell layer of the retinae of adult mice exposed to a gamma source (total dose = 3 Gy) at 16 days gestation. There was a significant reduction in the total number of neurons (displaced amacrine + ganglion cells) in the ganglion cell layer (33%) that was mainly caused by a pronounced loss (59%) of displaced amacrine cells. The diameters of the surviving retinal ganglion cells were consistently larger than those of the controls. Prenatal irradiation is the first experimental approach that partially eliminates displaced amacrine cells. It is suggested that the morphogenesis of retinal ganglion cells may be affected by displaced amacrine cells. Â© 2001 ISDN.,Excluded,0.9843688

799,"The analgesic effect of low dose focal irradiation in a mouse model of bone cancer is associated with spinal changes in neuro-mediators of nociception Despite the widespread use of radiotherapy to treat painful bone metastases, the mechanism underlying the analgesic effect of low dose ionizing radiation is unknown. Bone cancer pain is mostly associated with an inflammatory response dominated by local activation of osteoclasts and by astrogliosis in the spinal cord. We determined the effects of a 6 Gy irradiation given focally on osteolytic sarcoma cells inoculated in humeri of mice. Pain behavior was assessed using the rota-rod and the grip force test. Seven days post-irradiation (day 17 post-tumor implantation) the performance of mice markedly improved on the rotarod (non-irradiated, 67+/-16s vs irradiated, 223 +/- 22 s; P = 0.0005), and the grip force test (non-irradiated, 34 +/- 4 g vs irradiated, 55 +/- 2 g; P = 0.001). This improvement was similar to the analgesia achieved with 30 mg/kg of the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ketorolac (Rota-rod, 67 +/- 16 s vs 178 +/- 35 s; P = 0.01: grip force test, 34 +/- 4 g, vs 60 +/- 5 g; P = 0.003). Following irradiation, the tumor mass and the number of osteoclasts did not decrease while the expression of two pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) increased. Tumor irradiation led to clear differences in the spinal cord. These include a decrease in glial activity (astrocytes and microglial cells) as well as pain mediators such as dynorphin, COX-2 and chemotactic cytokine receptor (CCR2). We conclude that the analgesic effect of low dose irradiation of bone cancer is associated with the alteration of nociceptive transmission in the central nervous system.",Excluded,0.98428506

333,"Interactions between intraspinal Schwann cells and the cellular constituents normally occurring in the spinal cord: an ultrastructural study in the irradiated rat Relationships between intraspinal Schwann cells and neuroglia, particularly, astrocytes, were studied following X-irradiation of the spinal cord in 3-day-old rats. Initially, this exposure results in a depletion of the neuroglial population. By 10 days post-irradiation (P-I), gaps occur in the glia limitans, although the overlying basal lamina remains intact. Development of and myelination by intraspinal Schwann cells is well underway by 15 days P-I. These Schwann cell-occupied regions have a paucity of astrocyte processes, a finding which persists throughout the study (60 days P-I), and several types of Schwann cell-neuroglial interfaces are observed, including: (1) astrocyte separation of Schwann cells from oligodendrocyte-myelinated regions; (2) intermingling of Schwann cell-myelinated axons and oligodendrocyte-myelinated axons in the absence of astrocyte processes; and (3) ensheathment of unmyelinated axons by astrocyte processes which separate these axons from the Schwann cells. The gaps in the glia limitans widen as the P-I interval increases. At 45 and 60 days P-I, the basal lamina no longer forms a singular, continuous covering over the spinal cord surface, but follows instead a rather tortuous course over the disrupted glia limitans and the intraspinal Schwann cells. Although the mode of initial occurrence of Schwann cells within the spinal cord is not yet understood, the data indicate that the astrocyte population is involved in that process, as well as in limiting the further development of Schwann cells within the substance of the spinal cord.",Excluded,0.98421544

1119,"Effects of irradiation on brain vasculature using an in situ tumor model PURPOSE: Damage to normal tissue is a limiting factor in clinical radiotherapy (RT). We tested the hypothesis that the presence of tumor alters the response of normal tissues to irradiation using a rat in situ brain tumor model.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Intravital microscopy was used with a rat cranial window to assess the in situ effect of rat C6 glioma on peritumoral tissue with and without RT. The RT regimen included 40 Gy at 8 Gy/day starting Day 5 after tumor implant. Endpoints included blood-brain barrier permeability, clearance index, leukocyte-endothelial interactions and staining for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) glial fibrillary acidic protein, and apoptosis. To characterize the system response to RT, animal survival and tumor surface area and volume were measured. Sham experiments were performed on similar animals implanted with basement membrane matrix absent of tumor cells.RESULTS: The presence of tumor alone increases permeability but has little effect on leukocyte-endothelial interactions and astrogliosis. Radiation alone increases tissue permeability, leukocyte-endothelial interactions, and astrogliosis. The highest levels of permeability and cell adhesion were seen in the model that combined tumor and irradiation; however, the presence of tumor appeared to reduce the volume of rolling leukocytes. Unirradiated tumor and peritumoral tissue had poor clearance. Irradiated tumor and peritumoral tissue had a similar clearance index to irradiated and unirradiated sham-implanted animals. Radiation reduces the presence of VEGF in peritumoral normal tissues but did not affect the amount of apoptosis in the normal tissue. Apoptosis was identified in the tumor tissue with and without radiation.CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel approach to demonstrate that the presence of the tumor in a rat intracranial model alters the response of normal tissues to irradiation.",Excluded,0.9840673
785,"Effect of in utero irradiation on the postnatal development, behavior, and brain structure of rats: Dose fractionation with a 6-h interval Based on previous studies showing that exposure of the rat fetus to ionizing radiation produces dose-dependent (0.25-1.25 Gy) changes in postnatal development of behavior and decreases in the thickness of the cerebral cortex, we examined the extent to which dose fractionation would reduce expression of damage. Pregnant rats were exposed to single doses of 0.5 or 1.0 Gy, or to two doses of 0.5 Gy 6 h apart on day 15 of gestation. Offspring were subjected to four behavioral tests on postnatal days 7-28; the rats were then sacrificed and their brains removed and processed for histology. For all end points, the fractionated dose produced an effect that was intermediate between that of the 0.5- and 1.0-Gy doses and which, by interpolation, could be expressed as equivalent to a single dose between 0.5 and 1.0 Gy. The equivalent single dose was not significantly different from the 1.0-Gy dose for negative geotaxis (0.54 Gy), reflex suspension (0.80 Gy), and continuous corridor (0.85 Gy). For sine of the angle of the advance of hind feet (0.58 Gy), width of stride (0.69 Gy), length of stride (0.75 Gy), body weight (0.73 Gy), and cerebral cortex thickness (0.69 Gy), the fractionated dose produced effects significantly different (P < 0.05) from the 1.0-Gy dose. Overall, exposure of fetal rats to two doses of 0.5 Gy separated by 6 h produced effects equivalent to a single dose of 0.70 Gy, as measured by postnatal behavioral tests and morphological assessment of brain structure.",Excluded,0.9840596

742,"Sequelae in long-term survivors of small cell lung cancer PURPOSE: Central nervous system (CNS) effects of chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) are studied in long-term small cell lung cancer (SCLC) survivors. The exact significance and pathogenesis of the neurotoxicity is still unknown, as studies on this subject lack sufficient patient numbers and are performed in an extremely varied manner.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-nine survivors (> 2 years from diagnosis) were examined neurologically and neuropsychologically, and underwent a cranial computer tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance (MR). Eight patients were excluded from further analysis for various reasons (not SCLC-related CNS disease, n = 6; no chemotherapy nor PCI treatment, n = 2). The remaining 51 patients were divided into three groups; group 1 = chemotherapy alone (n = 21), group 2 = sequential PCI (n = 19), and group 3 = concurrent or sandwiched PCI (n = 11). Groups were neuropsychologically compared in matched controls.RESULTS: Performance status did not differ significantly between various treatment groups; all patients remained ambulatory and capable of self-care. Mental impairment (n = 20), motor abnormalities (n = 9), and visual complaints (n = 1), were found in five patients in group 1 (24%), eight patients in group 2 (42%), and eight patients in group 3 (73%). Analysis of brain atrophy revealed no significant results; however, white matter abnormalities were found more frequently in group 3. Neuropsychologically no significant group differences existed, although interference sensitivity and difficulties with divided attention tended to occur more frequently in patients treated with PCI. Mean neuropsychometric results of treatment groups were significantly worse than those of matched controls.CONCLUSIONS: Although more intensively treated patients showed more neurologic impairment and patients in group 3 had more white matter abnormalities, there was no statistic evidence for additional neurotoxicity of PCI. Marked neuropsychometric differences between patients and matched controls may indicate that cognitive impairment is partly disease related, probably due to emotional distress and deteriorated physical condition.",Excluded,0.98314214
1009,"Cognitive impairment and spontaneous epilepsy in rats with malformations of cortical development Purpose: To examine the cognition, spontaneous epilepsy, and electroencephalography (EEG) characteristics of rats with malformations of cortical development (MCD) and their use as an animal model for investigating the pathogenesis of intractable epilepsy and screening novel antiepileptic drugs. Method(s): An epileptic rat model of MCD was established with the F1 generation of pregnant rats after X-irradiation with 175 cGy (Group L), 195 cGy (Group M), or 215 cGy (Group H). Long-term video-EEG monitoring was used to record the seizures in the rats with MCD. Cognition was assessed with the Morris water maze. The EEGs were recorded and analyzed in the frontal and parietal lobes and hippocampi of adult rats. Finally, the brain tissues were processed for Nissl staining. Result(s): The model groups exhibited markedly prolonged escape latencies and distinct decrements in the percent distance traveled in the target quadrant and platform-crossing frequency. These findings were dose-dependent. Frequent interictal epileptiform discharges were observed in the frontal and parietal lobes and hippocampi of adult rats, and their incidences were markedly higher in the model groups compared with that in the normal controls, with Group M having the highest incidence. Spontaneous seizures were observed in the model groups (mean incidence, 46.7%). The daily mean frequency of seizures and the incidence of spontaneous seizures were highest in Group M. Nissl staining revealed a dose-dependent pattern of hippocampal abnormalities, cortical and subcortical nodular heterotopia, and callosal agenesis in the model groups. Conclusion(s): The 195 cGy dose was most appropriate for establishing an epileptic model of MCD with X-irradiation. Copyright Â© 2015 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40,"Melatonin secretion following brain midline irradiation is diminished, but not correlated with subjective sleep disturbances Objective: Cranial irradiation for brain tumours or leukaemias has been related to cognitive, endocrine and psychosocial late effects as well as sleep disturbances and increased daytime sleepiness. Studies suggest that cranial irradiation might impact on pineal melatonin secretion. Melatonin is an important regulator in human circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle. The objective of this study was to investigate melatonin secretion, subjective sleep parameters and their interplay in a cohort of cranially irradiated head and brain tumour and leukaemia survivors at least 3 years after radiotherapy. Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Patient(s): Thirty-eight adults. Measurements: Melatonin secretion was evaluated by measuring its metabolite 6-sulphatoxymelatonin in collected overnight urine. Subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The Beck Depression Inventory II was used to screen for depressive symptoms because of their impact on sleep. Result(s): Patients irradiated in the brain midline had significantly lower melatonin secretion (P = 0.008). Subjects exhibited a high prevalence of sleeping difficulties, daytime sleepiness and depression, with females and overweight subjects particularly affected. Melatonin values and subjective sleep parameters did not correlate with each other or with treatment and most patient variables. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that radiation exposure to the pineal gland negatively affects melatonin secretion. This lack of pineal melatonin does not influence subjective sleep quality. As melatonin has important antioxidant and cancer-protective effects, further research is necessary to elucidate whether these patients have an increased risk of developing secondary neoplasms and other radiation late effects.

220,"Cerebral Cortex Regions Selectively Vulnerable to Radiation Dose-Dependent Atrophy PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: Neurologic deficits after brain radiation therapy (RT) typically involve decline in higher-order cognitive functions such as attention and memory rather than sensory defects or paralysis. We sought to determine whether areas of the cortex critical to cognition are selectively vulnerable to radiation dose-dependent atrophy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We measured change in cortical thickness in 54 primary brain tumor patients who underwent fractionated, partial brain RT. The study patients underwent high-resolution, volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (T1-weighted; T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, FLAIR) before RT and 1 year afterward. Semiautomated software was used to segment anatomic regions of the cerebral cortex for each patient. Cortical thickness was measured for each region before RT and 1 year afterward. Two higher-order cortical regions of interest (ROIs) were tested for association between radiation dose and cortical thinning: entorhinal (memory) and inferior parietal (attention/memory). For comparison, 2 primary cortex ROIs were also tested: pericalcarine (vision) and paracentral lobule (somatosensory/motor). Linear mixed-effects analyses were used to test all other cortical regions for significant radiation dose-dependent thickness change. Statistical significance was set at alpha = 0.05 using 2-tailed tests.RESULTS: Cortical atrophy was significantly associated with radiation dose in the entorhinal (P=.01) and inferior parietal ROIs (P=.02). By contrast, no significant radiation dose-dependent effect was found in the primary cortex ROIs (pericalcarine and paracentral lobule). In the whole-cortex analysis, 9 regions showed significant radiation dose-dependent atrophy, including areas responsible for memory, attention, and executive function (P<=.002).CONCLUSIONS: Areas of cerebral cortex important for higher-order cognition may be most vulnerable to radiation-related atrophy. This is consistent with clinical observations that brain radiation patients experience deficits in domains of memory, executive function, and attention. Correlations of regional cortical atrophy with domain-specific cognitive functioning in prospective trials are warranted.",Excluded,0.98221016
1076,"MR Imaging Evaluation of Intracerebral Hemorrhages and T2 Hyperintense White Matter Lesions Appearing after Radiation Therapy in Adult Patients with Primary Brain Tumors The purpose of our study was to determine the frequency and severity of intracerebral hemorrhages and T2 hyperintense white matter lesions (WMLs) following radiation therapy for brain tumors in adult patients. Of 648 adult brain tumor patients who received radiation therapy at our institute, magnetic resonance (MR) image data consisting of a gradient echo (GRE) and FLAIR T2-weighted image were available three and five years after radiation therapy in 81 patients. Intracerebral hemorrhage was defined as a hypointense dot lesion appearing on GRE images after radiation therapy. The number and size of the lesions were evaluated. The T2 hyperintense WMLs observed on the FLAIR sequences were graded according to the extent of the lesion. Intracerebral hemorrhage was detected in 21 (25.9%) and 35 (43.2) patients in the three- and five-year follow-up images, respectively. The number of intracerebral hemorrhages per patient tended to increase as the follow-up period increased, whereas the size of the intracerebral hemorrhages exhibited little variation over the course of follow-up. T2 hyperintense WMLs were observed in 27 (33.3%) and 32 (39.5) patients in the three and five year follow-up images, respectively. The age at the time of radiation therapy was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the patients with T2 hyperintense WMLs than in those without lesions. Intracerebral hemorrhages are not uncommon in adult brain tumor patients undergoing radiation therapy. The incidence and number of intracerebral hemorrhages increased over the course of follow-up. T2 hyperintense WMLs were observed in more than one-third of the study population.",Excluded,0.9812671
46,"The polyamine inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine modulates hippocampus-dependent function after single and combined injuries Exposure to uncontrolled irradiation in a radiologic terrorism scenario, a natural disaster or a nuclear battlefield, will likely be concomitantly superimposed on other types of injury, such as trauma. In the central nervous system, radiation combined injury (RCI) involving irradiation and traumatic brain injury may have a multifaceted character. This may entail cellular and molecular changes that are associated with cognitive performance, including changes in neurogenesis and the expression of the plasticity-related immediate early gene Arc. Because traumatic stimuli initiate a characteristic early increase in polyamine metabolism, we hypothesized that treatment with the polyamine inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) would reduce the adverse effects of single or combined injury on hippocampus structure and function. Hippocampal dependent cognitive impairments were quantified with the Morris water maze and showed that DFMO effectively reversed cognitive impairments after all injuries, particularly traumatic brain injury. Similar results were seen with respect to the expression of Arc protein, but not neurogenesis. Given that polyamines have been found to modulate inflammatory responses in the brain we also assessed the numbers of total and newly born activated microglia, and found reduced numbers of newly born cells. While the mechanisms responsible for the improvement in cognition after DFMO treatment are not yet clear, the present study provides new and compelling data regarding the potential use of DFMO as a potential countermeasure against the adverse effects of single or combined injury.",Excluded,0.98121864

110,"Annual rate of hearing loss falls after fractionated stereotactic irradiation for vestibular schwannoma PURPOSE: The rate of hearing loss in a population before and after irradiation was investigated to determine the effect of irradiation on hearing impairment.METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 72 patients with vestibular schwannoma who received fractionated stereotactic irradiation from 1992 to 1999, 21 had had their hearing levels examined 3 months or more before the treatment. The mean time between the initial examination and treatment was 18.6 months (range: 3-89 months), and the mean time between treatment and the last follow-up was 24.2 months (12-69 months). Thirty-six to 50 Gy in 20-25 fractions over 5 to 6 weeks was given using an X-ray beam from a linear accelerator. Pure tone average (PTA) was measured using the mean hearing level at five frequencies, and the annual rate of hearing loss was defined as [(hearing loss in PTA(dB))/(follow-up period (months)x12)].RESULTS: The actual cumulative curve of decrease in tumor size of 2 mm or more was 38.3% at 2 years and 80.0% at 3 years. The mean of hearing loss in PTA was 11.6+/-10.3 dB (-1 to 35 dB) from the initial examination to the start of irradiation and 11.9+/-14.4 dB (-14 to 37 dB) from the start of irradiation to the last follow-up. The mean annual rates of hearing loss before irradiation and in the 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th years after irradiation were, respectively, 18.6, 11.2, 6.2, 5.1, and 5.0 dB/year. The annual rates of hearing loss in the 2nd year (P=0.025) and 3rd year (P=0.018) were significantly slower than the rate before irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: The mean annual rate of hearing loss was higher before irradiation than after irradiation, and hearing loss slowed rather than accelerated after irradiation. Although hearing loss after the treatment was usually permanent, fractionated stereotactic irradiation was suggested to be effective to lower the rate of hearing loss.",Excluded,0.98083055

The median apical and scleral tumour dose was 100 Gy (range 15-200 Gy) and 1000 Gy (range 200-1200 Gy), respectively. The median follow up time was 2.8 and 2.0 years (range 1 month to 10 years) for anterior and posterior segment complications, respectively.RESULTS: The 3 and 5 year probabilities of being without radiation cataract were 73% and 63%, without neovascular glaucoma 91% and 81%, without vitreous haemorrhage 83% and 74%, without radiation maculopathy 85% and 70%, and without radiation optic neuropathy 90% and 88%, respectively. The risk of radiation cataract was highest with large tumour size (T1 + T2 v T3, p = 0.0027; height < or = 5 v > 5 mm, p = 0.029; largest basal diameter (LBD) < or = 15 v > 15 mm, p < 0.0001) and location of anterior tumour margin anterior v posterior to the equator (p = 0.0003); the risk of neovascular glaucoma with large size (T1 + T2 v T3, p = 0.039; LBD < or = 15 mm v 15 mm, p = 0.021); and the risk of maculopathy and optic neuropathy with proximity of the posterior tumour margin to the fovea and the optic disc (< or = 1.5 v > 1.5 mm; p = 0.030 and p = 0.0004, respectively). In Cox's multivariate analysis the strongest risk indicator for radiation cataract (RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.6) and vitreous haemorrhage (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8) was the height of the tumour; for neovascular glaucoma the TNM class (RR 6.2, 95% CI 2.7-13.8); for radiation maculopathy location of posterior tumour margin within 2 mm from the fovea (RR 3.4, 95% CI 2.0-6.0); and for radiation optic neuropathy location of tumour margin within 1 DD of the optic disc (RR 6.1, 95% CI 3.0-12.4). The 3 and 5 year probabilities of avoiding enucleation were 92% and 85%, respectively. Ten eyes were enucleated--six because of recurrent tumour growth, three because of treatment complications, and one because of mistakenly suspected extraocular growth.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the frequency of radiation related complications after ruthenium brachytherapy of uveal melanoma is acceptable, in particular as regard irradiation of small and medium sized tumours for which ruthenium therapy generally is recommended.",Excluded,0.98039526

No effect of irradiation on dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes was observed. Previously it was shown that, on exposure to gamma-rays, sphingomyelin and phosphatidylglycerol, as opposed to phosphatidylcholine, broke down into fragments of lower molecular weight.

Characteristics of patients and AVM related to hemorrhagic or nonhemorrhagic presentation were evaluated by logistic regression. Risk factors predicting AVM hemorrhage during the period from the diagnosis to GKS of AVM and during the latency period after radiosurgery were evaluated using Cox regression hazards model.RESULTS: The annual hemorrhage rate before GKS was 2.0% assuming patients were at risk for hemorrhage since their birth. The hemorrhage rate calculated between the diagnosis and GKS of AVM was 6.6% and reduced to 2.5% after GKS until obliteration of the AVM. Although small and deep nidi and those with deep and single draining veins tended to present themselves with hemorrhage, only nidi with single draining veins and those ruptured before were more likely to bleed once the AVM had been diagnosed. These factors no longer predisposed the nidus to a rupture after radiosurgery and the only predicting factor for hemorrhage was a low radiosurgical prescription dose to the margin of nidus.CONCLUSIONS: The AVM hemorrhage rate seems to reduce after GKS. After radiosurgery, none of the patients or nidus-related risk factors remained relevant to the occurrence of hemorrhage. The nidus treated with a high radiosurgical dose is less likely to bleed.",Excluded,0.9750104
244,"Brain dysplasia evoked by gamma irradiation at different stages of prenatal development leads to different tonic and clonic seizure reactivity Rats with brain dysplasia evoked by interruption of different stages of prenatal neurogenesis show characteristic variations in susceptibility to seizures depending on the neurochemical specificity of pharmacological agents used to evoke seizures. To verify a discrepancy between the data obtained using different pharmacological models, neurochemically neutral electroshocks were applied here. To produce brain dysplasia of different degrees, pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to a single 1.0. Gy dose of gamma rays on gestation days 13, 15, 17 or 19. From the postnatal day 60, their male offspring (E13s, E15s, E17s and E19s, respectively) were subjected to 21 daily electrical stimulations to evoke seizures. Profiles of tonic and clonic reactivity to electrical stimulation significantly differed from those observed following pilocarpine or kainic acid administration. E17s showed minimal intensity of tonic but maximal of clonic responses. On the contrary, very high tonic and low clonic reactivity was observed in E13s and E15s. Periventricular nodular heterotopias (PNHs) were observed exclusively in E15s and E17s. Generally, the size of PNHs was correlated positively with susceptibility to tonic seizures but negatively with susceptibility to clonic seizures. Analogous correlations with the size of the neocortex were opposite. E13s and E19s had brains devoid PNHs but showed high tonic seizure susceptibility similar to that in E15s. It can therefore be concluded that PNHs modified the type of seizure reactivity from tonic to clonic, depending of their size, but the presence of PNHs was not necessary for the development of seizure susceptibility itself.

However, the effect of RT on IPN, a precursor to intraplaque hemorrhage and thus associated with plaque vulnerability, is unknown.METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patients who had undergone unilateral RT for head and neck cancer >=2 years previously underwent B-mode and contrast-enhanced ultrasound of both RT-side and non-RT-side carotid arteries. Presence of IPN during contrast-enhanced ultrasound was judged semiquantitatively as grade 0 (absent), grade 1 (present but limited to plaque base), or grade 2 (extensive and noted within plaque body).RESULTS: Of 49 patients studied, 38 (78%) had plaques. The number of plaques was significantly greater in the RT than the non-RT arteries. Overall, 48 of 64 RT-side plaques (75%) had IPN compared with 9 of 23 non-RT-side (39%) plaques (p = 0.002). Among patients with plaques, IPN was present in 81% of patients with RT-side plaques and 41% of patients with non-RT-side plaques (p = 0.004). Grade 0 IPN was significantly more common in patients with non-RT-side plaques (25% vs. 61%; p = 0.002), whereas grade 2 plaques were more common on the RT side (31% vs. 9%; p = 0.03). The only clinical variable that predicted the presence or absence of IPN was RT laterality.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in humans to reveal a significant association between RT and the presence and extent of IPN. This may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the increased stroke risk among survivors of head and neck cancer treated by RT.",Excluded,0.9747274
358,"Radiosensitivity and differentiation of ganglion cells within fetal mouse retinal explants in vitro Fetal mouse retinas were explanted at 13-14 days of gestation, and exposed to gamma radiation in vitro. Not all regions of the retina were equally susceptible to radiation-induced necrosis; when exposed to 5000 rads soon after explanation, each explant had a single small radioresistant nubbin of apparently intact tissue, located near the optic nerve-head. This region of radioresistant tissue was larger when the dose of radiation was reduced and when the explants were exposed at later times in vitro, indicating the existence of a gradient of radioresistance across retinal explants which spread outward through at least the first week in vitro, the period examined. Based upon the extensive in situ literature which has correlated the emergence of radioresistance with the differentiation of retinal neurons, we conclude that the in situ central-to-peripheral sequence of cellular differentiation continues in vitro within our retinal explants. Whereas the ganglion cell axonal outgrowth from control retinas grown in isolation on collagen substrates underwent a gradual disintegration over 3 weeks in vitro, the sparse axonal outgrowth from explants exposed to 5000 rads disintegrated abruptly at 5-7 days in vitro. This did not appear to be due to direct damage from radiation, but instead reflected the fact that axons in irradiated cultures arose from central retinal regions only, while many axons in control cultures emerged from later-differentiating peripheral regions. We suggest that disintegration of individual axons in the outgrowth may occur rapidly and in a central-to-peripheral sequence. These findings should be useful in designing assays for trophic factors which may prevent ganglion cell axon disintegration in this in vitro model system.",Excluded,0.97376955

34,"Disinhibited in vitro neocortical slices containing experimentally induced cortical dysplasia demonstrate hyperexcitability Cortical dysplasia, a disorder of neuronal migration, has a strong association with intractable epilepsy in humans but little is known about the physiologic abnormalities that are present in this condition. Fetal rats were exposed to external irradiation to experimentally produce diffuse cortical dysplasia. In vitro neocortical slices from adult irradiated and control animals were examined in physiologic solution and in the presence of the A-type gamma-amino butyric acid (GABAA) receptor antagonist, bicuculline methiodide. Epileptiform bursts were quantified by counting the number of negative field potentials per epileptiform event. In the presence of bicuculline, neocortical slices with cortical dysplasia demonstrated more robust epileptiform activity in the form of an increased number of negative field potentials per epileptiform event. This demonstrates that areas of experimentally induced cortical dysplasia possess an inherent hyperexcitability when GABAA-mediated inhibition is effectively blocked.",Excluded,0.9727193
246,"PCI-no What does prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) prevent in ED-SCLC? - Why isn't the presence of brain metastasis evaluated before performing PCI? Background: In a European trial, prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was performed on patients with extensive-disease small cell lung cancer (ED- SCLC). As a result, PCI was reported to reduce the incidence of symptomatic brain metastasis and to prolong patient survival. However, their treatments were completely different from our routine medical care. For example, they did not perform tests to examine whether there was a metastatic brain tumor before assignment to the PCI group or observation group and, after assignment, symptoms alone were observed and no imaging test was performed. For this reason, in Japan, we corrected this inconsistency of protocol and repeated the trial to determine whether PCI contributes to prolonged survival. Participants and Method: Included in the current trial were patients who underwent two or more cycles of platinum-based combination chemotherapy, had achieved at least stable disease (SD), and had no metastatic brain tumor on their MRI. They were randomly assigned to either the PCI group or observation group. Follow-up with brain, chest and abdominal diagnostic imaging tests was performed every three months in both groups. Result(s): In the first pre-specified interim analysis, it was found that there was no possibility of improving patient prognosis using PCI even if the trial were continued. An independent data monitoring committee therefore terminated the trial. At that time, 224 cases had already been enrolled, with 113 cases assigned to the PCI group and 111 cases to the observation group. Median survival period in the final analysis was 11.6 months for the PCI group and 13.7 months for the observation group (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.68). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups, but PCI actually tended to make the prognosis somewhat worse or, at least, did not improve prognosis in patients with ED-SCLC. Discussion(s): The biggest difference between the two trials was whether follow-up assessments were conducted using symptoms or brain MRI. In the current trial, it is impossible to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic brain metastasis cases; however, in the European trial, asymptomatic brain metastasis cases were also included, which means that there were in fact two different subgroups in the PCI group: a subgroup of patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis undergoing therapeutic cranial irradiation and a subgroup of patients without brain metastasis undergoing true PCI. It seems that the survival difference between patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis in the PCI group and in the observation group caused the apparent improvement of survival period. On the other hand, it is conjectured that PCI generated a lot of toxic effects in the patients without brain metastasis and that their survival curve tended to be inferior. PCI is a treatment to prevent new brain metastasis. One year of PCI reduces the incidence of new brain metastasis in no more than 30% of cases. For patients with MRI showing no metastatic brain tumor, needless PCI can be avoided by performing regular brain imaging tests, without impairing survival.",Excluded,0.972605

1027,"A link between vascular damage and cognitive deficits after whole-brain radiation therapy for cancer: A clue to other types of dementia? Whole brain radiation therapy for the treatment of tumors can sometimes cause cognitive impairment. Memory deficits were noted in up to 50% of treated patients over a short period of several months. In addition, an increased rate of dementia in young patients has been noted over the longer term, i.e. years. A deficit in neurogenesis after irradiation has been postulated to be the main cause of cognitive decline in patients, but recent data on irradiation therapy for limited parts of the brain appear to indicate other possibilities. Irradiation can directly damage various types of cells other than neuronal stem cells. However, this paper will focus on injury to brain vasculature leading to cognitive decline since vessels represent a better therapeutic target for drug development than other cells in the brain because of the blood-brain barrier.",Excluded,0.9712034

A Multicenter Phase 2 Trial (SAKK 15/12) PURPOSE: Our purpose was to evaluate neurocognitive function (NCF) and clinical outcomes after early hippocampal avoidance (HA) prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited disease (LD) small cell lung cancer (SCLC).METHODS AND MATERIALS: In a phase 2 trial, patients with LD SCLC received HA-PCI concomitant with the second cycle of chemotherapy and thoracic radiation therapy. All patients underwent objective NCF testing at baseline, 6 weeks, and 6 and 12 months after HA-PCI. NCF tests included Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised, Controlled Oral Word Association, and Trail Making Tests A and B. The primary endpoint was NCF decline at 6 months after HA-PCI. We assumed <=30% of patients with no NCF decline to be unpromising. Secondary endpoints included brain metastases-free survival (BMFS), overall survival (OS), and safety of the concomitant treatment.RESULTS: Among the 44 patients enrolled in the trial, 38 had evaluable NCF assessment at 6 months after HA-PCI. The proportion of evaluable patients showing no NCF decline at 6 and 12 months was 34.2% (90% confidence interval [CI], 21.6-48.8) and 48.5% (95% CI, 30.8-66.5), respectively. Median follow-up was 13.2 months (95% CI, 12.6-14.1). At 12 months, BMFS was 84.2% and OS was 87.7% (95% CI, 73.0-94.7). Four patients died of SCLC, 1 of respiratory failure, 1 of hemorrhage, and 1 for unknown reason. The most frequently reported grade >=3 acute adverse events were anemia (21.4%), febrile neutropenia (19.1%), and fatigue (14.3%).CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of patients showing no NCF decline 6 and 12 months after early HA-PCI does not appear to be better than, but rather similar to, that observed in patients receiving sequential PCI without HA. Early HA-PCI in LD SCLC is feasible, with observation of promising BMFS and OS in this selected population.",Excluded,0.97091585

357,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation in extensive disease small-cell lung cancer: Short-term health-related quality of life and patient reported symptoms-results of an international phase III randomized controlled trial by the EORTC radiation oncology and lung cancer groups Purpose Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients with extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) leads to significantly fewer symptomatic brain metastases and improved survival. Detailed effects of PCI on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are reported here. Patients and Methods Patients (age, 18 to 75 years; WHO <= 2) with ED-SCLC, and any response to chemotherapy, were randomly assigned to either observation or PCI. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and patient-reported symptoms were secondary end points. The European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer core HRQOL tool (Quality of Life Questionnaire C30) and brain module (Quality of Life Questionnaire Brain Cancer Module) were used to collect self-reported patient data. Six HRQOL scales were selected as primary HRQOL end points: global health status; hair loss; fatigue; and role, cognitive and emotional functioning. Assessments were performed at random assignment, 6 weeks, 3 months, and then 3-monthly up to 1 year and 6-monthly thereafter. Results Compliance with the HRQOL assessment was 93.7% at baseline and dropped to 60% at 6 weeks. Short-term results up to 3 months showed that there was a negative impact of PCI on selected HROOL scales. The largest mean difference between the two arms was observed for fatigue and hair loss. The impact of PCI on global health status as well as on functioning scores was more limited. For global health status, the observed mean difference was eight points on a scale 0 to 100 at 6 weeks (P = .018) and 3 months (P = .055). Conclusion PCI should be offered to all responding ED SCLC patients. Patients should be informed of the potential adverse effects from PCI. Clinicians should be alert to these; monitor their patients; and offer appropriate support, clinical, and psychosocial care. Â©2008 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded,0.9675707

Progesterone receptor immunoreactivity was detected in 70% of tumors. Estrogen receptor immunoreactivity was not detected. An inverse correlation was found between detection of progesterone receptors and the PFPCNA index. The overall 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 68%. The only prognostic factor that significantly affected PFS rate was the PFPCNA index. The 2-year PFS was 42% for tumors with a high PFPCNA index (value > or = 24%) and 91% for tumors with a low PFPCNA index (value < 24%). Tumors with a high PFPCNA index were 9.1 times as likely to recur as were tumors with a low PFPCNA index.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study confirms the value of irradiation for dogs with incompletely resected meningiomas. Prognostic value of the PFPCNA index suggests-that duration of treatment and interval from surgery to start of irradiation may affect outcome. Loss of progesterone receptors in some tumors may be responsible for an increase in PFPCNA index and may indirectly affect prognosis after radiation therapy.",Excluded,0.9669923

[Chinese] BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The recurrence rate in skull base is high for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement. This study was conducted to explore the impact of dose boost in skull base on the recurrence in skull base and survival of NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement. METHOD(S): A total of 120 stage T4 NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement proved by histopathology and computed tomography (CT) were treated in our hospital from Oct. 1996 to Nov. 1998. The irradiation dose was (71.55+/-3.09) Gy in nasopharynx and (58.95+/-6.16) Gy in neck. Of the 120 patients, 27 received irradiation (6-10 Gy) in skull base after radiotherapy (boost group), 93 did not receive irradiation in skull base (control group). Fifty-three patients, 41 in control group and 12 in boost group, received cisplatin-based chemotherapy for 1-3 cycles. The survival rates and the recurrence of the 2 groups were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. RESULT(S): The clinical characteristics of patients were similar in the 2 groups. The 1-, 3-, 5-year skull base control rates were significantly higher in boost group than in control group (100% vs. 93.4%, 91.8% vs. 76.4%, and 86.8% vs. 65.1%, respectively, P=0.045). The 1-, 3-, 5-year disease-freely survival rates were slightly higher in boost group than in control group (85.2% vs. 75.3%, 59.3% vs. 45.2%, and 51.9% vs. 31.2%, respectively, P=0.084). The median disease-freely survival time was longer in boost group than in control group (60 months vs. 30 months). The prevalences of irradiation-induced brain damage were 7.4% in boost group and 4.3% in control group with no significant difference (P=0.514).

The patients were randomized to receive two different postoperative external radiation protocols, Study Group A: Localized field external radiotherapy 50 Gy/25#/5 wks followed by Boost 10 Gy/5#/1 wk, Control Group B: Whole brain external radiotherapy 40 Gy/20#/4 wks followed by Boost 20 Gy/10#/2 wks by localized field.RESULTS: 20/25 (80%) patients in the study group and 14/25 (56%) patients in the control group showed improvement in their Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Thus a significant difference in the performance status was noted in favor of limited field irradiation. No significant difference in the local response was seen between the two groups after radiotherapy. Six months progression-free survival of the study group was 44% as compared to 26% in the control group.

Rat 9L gliosarcomas implanted in nude mice brains were irradiated by MRT 13 days after tumor inoculation using two orthogonal arrays of equally spaced 28 planar microbeams (25 microm width, 211 microm spacing and dose 500 Gy). At 1, 7 and 14 days after MRT, apparent diffusion coefficient, blood volume and vessel size index were mapped by MRI. Mean survival time after tumor inoculation increased significantly between MRT-treated and untreated groups (23 and 28 days respectively, log-rank test, p < 0.0001). A significant increase of apparent diffusion coefficient was observed 24 h after MRT in irradiated tumors versus non-irradiated ones. In the untreated group, both tumor size and vessel size index increased significantly (from 7.6 +/- 2.2 to 19.2 +/- 4.0 mm(2) and +23%, respectively) between the 14th and the 21st day after tumor cell inoculation. During the same period, in the MRT-treated group, no difference in tumor size was observed. The vessel size index measured in the MRT-treated group increased significantly (+26%) between 14 and 28 days of tumor growth. We did not observe the significant difference in blood volume between the MRT-treated and untreated groups. MRT slows 9L tumor growth in a mouse brain but MRI results suggest that the increase in survival time after our MRT approach may be rather due to a cytoreduction than to early direct effects of ionizing radiation on tumor vessels.

However these benefits have not been validated in community-based cohorts. The objective is to assess the impact of early vs not-early PC among cancer decedents on the risk of receiving aggressive care (ED/hospitalization), supportive care (home care/physician home visit), or hospital death. Method(s): We took a retrospective cohort of Ontario decedents between 2004 and 2014. We identified those who were 'early' PC users (i.e. used a validated PC service between month 12-6 before death [exposure]). We used propensity score matching to identify a control group of 'not-early' PC users. We hard matched on age, sex, cancer type and stage. The propensity score included region, income, year, radiation, etc. Among those with InterRAI assessments in exposure period, we additionally controlled for health instability, and dependency, depression, cognitive performance, pain, and caregiver presence via propensity score. McNemar test used to examine differences between pairs. Result(s): 51,001 decedents received early PC vs 85,979 not-early PC (i.e. late or none). After matching among those with no interRAI assessments, we found 34,184 pairs of early and not-early PC users. Both groups had equal distributions of age, sex, cancer type (e.g. 25% lung cancer) and stage (e.g. 24% stage 3 or 4). Compared to not-early PC users, early PC users had a 10% lower absolute risk to die in hospital and have any aggressive care respectively and a 24% higher absolute risk to any receive supportive care. In a mutually exclusive cohort, matching among those with interRAI assessments, we identified 3,419 pairs of early and not-early PC users. Both groups had equal scores in health instability (e.g. 12% moderate-high CHESS score) and other interRAI scales. The outcome results were similar to the non-interRAI analysis. Conclusion(s): Using propensity score matching, decedents receiving early PC are likely to receive more supportive care and less aggressive care compared to not-early PC users. Our study uniquely focuses on a population receiving community palliative care. In a distinct sample using interRAI assessments, we control for several confounders previously unmeasured.

The infiltration of BMDCs, which includes endothelial progenitors, pericyte progenitors, tumor-associated macrophages, immature monocytes, VEGFR<sup>+</sup> hemangiocytes, and CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells has been implicated in supporting tumor establishment by contributing to tumor growth, angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, inflammation, and immune suppression. In this work, we have used a rodent glioma in situ allograft model to study the recruitment/migration of BMDCs post RT. Female albino C57 (8-10 weeks old, Jackson Laboratories) animals underwent +DsRed bone marrow transplant (B6.Cg-Tg(CAG-DsRed*MST)1Nagy/J donor mouse). Following engraftment, glioma cells were cranially implanted with 1x10 glioma cells (GL261-Luc, Perkin Elmer), at an average size of 26.4mm indicated by a bioluminescence signal of 5.28x10 photons/sec/cm/sr, animals underwent 6Gy (RadSource 2000, 250kVp, 25mA) of irradiation limited to a 1cm wide slit centered on the tumor. Bioluminescence (tumor size) and fluorescence imaging (+DsRed BMDCs) was performed prior to and at 1-and 2-weeks post-RT to assess tumor growth and measure the influx of +DsRed BMDCs. In addition, flow cytometry was used to measure the number of +DsRed BMDCs in the tumor and brain. To study the effect of BMDCs in tumor regression, tumors were irradiated at a smaller size (9.3mm) with 10Gy irradiation. At 1-week post-RT, flow cytometry was used to measure the number of BMDCs (CD45+) in the tumor. In our model 6Gy radiation was able to stall the growth of the tumor. Irradiated tumors did not significantly change in tumor size at either 1-or 2-weeks post irradiation compared to pre-RT size. In addition, irradiated tumors were significantly smaller than untreated tumors (p=0.0008) 1-week post-RT. Using flow cytometry 1-week post irradiation, we observed a significant increase in the number of +DsRed BMDCs in the irradiated tumor (23.5% of cells +DsRed BMDCs) compared to the irradiated brain (6.17% cells +DsRed BMDCs, p=0.03) as well as a significant increase in the tumors (16.6% cells +DsRed BMDCs) compared to the brain (11.1% cells +DsRed BMDCs p=0.02). There was no difference in the number of +DsRed BMDCS in tumors +/- irradiation or brains +/- irradiation. We found similar results in our tumor regression model using flow cytometry 1-week post-RT; we observed an increase in the number of BMDCs CD45+ in the tumor (~20% of cells CD45+) compared to control tumors (~6% of cells CD45+). Indicating that tumor size at the onset of RT did not effect the migration of BMDCs. Fluorescence imaging did not measure any significant change in the DsRed signal at 1-or 2-weeks post-irradiation. We have successfully shown that post-RT there is an increase in BMDCs migration at 1-week post RT regardless of tumor size at RT. Further experimentation is needed to better elucidate the role of BMDCs in tumor inflammation and immune suppression as well as angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Our next step is to perform immunohistochemistry on our collected tumor tissue to map out the spatial location of migrated BMDCs within the tumor.",Excluded,0.9565656

NCF tests included Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised (HVLT-R), Controlled Oral Word Association (COWAT), and Trail Making Tests (TMT) A and B. The primary endpoint was NCF decline at 6 months after HA-PCI. We assumed a rate of <= 30% of patients with no NCF decline as unpromising. Secondary endpoints included brain metastases free survival (BMFS), overall survival (OS), and safety of the concomitant treatment. Result(s): Among the 44 patients enrolled in the trial, 38 had evaluable NCF assessment at 6 months after HA-PCI. The rate of evaluable patients showing no NCF decline at 6 and 12 months was 34.2% (90% CI: 21.6 - 48.8%) and 48.5% (95% CI: 30.8 - 66.5%), respectively (Figure 1). Median follow-up was 13.2 months (95% CI: 12.6 - 14.1). At 12 months, the rate of BMFS was 84.2% (95% CI: 68.1 - 92.8%), and of OS was 87.7% (95% CI: 73.0 - 94.7%). Four patients died due to SCLC, 1 due to respiratory failure, 1 due to hemorrhage, and 1 for unknown reason. The most frequently reported grade >= 3 acute adverse events were anemia (21.4%), febrile neutropenia (19.1%) and fatigue (14.3%). [Figure Presented] Conclusion(s): The rate of patients showing no NCF decline 6 and 12 months after early HA-PCI concomitant to CHT does not appear to be better, but rather similar to that observed in patients receiving sequential PCI without HA.<sup>1</sup> Early HA-PCI in LD SCLC is feasible, with observation of promising BMFS and OS.

540,"Time Dependence of Radiation-induced Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis Dysfunction in Adults Treated for Non-pituitary, Intracranial Neoplasms AIMS: Hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) dysfunction is a sequela of cranial radiotherapy. The purpose of this study was to use endocrine data from existing publications to characterise the baseline endocrine status, the effects of radiotherapy on the HPA during the first follow-up year and the time dependence of radiation-induced HPA dysfunction in patients treated with radiotherapy for non-pituitary intracranial neoplasms.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search of databases was carried out for articles that reported the results of endocrine testing for patients aged 16 years and older who were treated with neurosurgery for non-pituitary intracranial neoplasms or radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal neoplasms. To analyse the radiotherapy-related changes in hormone levels over time, long-term prospective endocrine data from nasopharyngeal studies were normalised to baseline hormone data and fitted to an exponential decay model. This process was repeated with normalisation to year 1 hormone data.RESULTS: Eight unique articles met eligibility criteria. HPA dysfunction occurred in 21.6-64.7% of patients who were assessed for endocrinopathies following neurosurgery. Studies on the early effects of radiotherapy on nasopharyngeal patients showed statistically significant changes in growth hormone, luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels during the first year of follow-up. Time dependence modelling showed that normalisation to year 1 hormone levels yield exponential equations with stronger measures of goodness of fit.CONCLUSION: HPA dysfunction in patients treated for non-pituitary intracranial neoplasms is probably a result of both neurosurgery and radiotherapy treatments. Although statistically significant endocrine changes can occur during this first year of follow-up, those documented at year 1 may be more predictive of subsequent HPA dysfunction.",Excluded,0.9526183
923,"Consistency of breast and arm symptoms during the first two years after breast cancer surgery PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To examine the severity and development of breast and arm symptoms separately during the two years following breast cancer surgery, and to examine whether previously defined predictors of arm symptoms are associated with breast symptoms.DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with two-year follow-up.SETTING: Three institutions in the Stockholm, Sweden, region.SAMPLE: 645 women, aged 20-63 years, enrolled within 12 weeks of surgery for primary breast cancer.METHODS: Baseline register and questionnaire data with five follow-ups were submitted to descriptive, inferential, and logistic regression analysis.MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Severity of breast and arm symptoms measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer breast cancer-specific quality-of-life questionnaire.FINDINGS: Most participants had undergone breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node dissection, and were scheduled for postoperative radiation therapy. Overall mean levels of breast and arm symptoms were low, but with large individual variations. At all six time points, the mean levels of breast symptoms were significantly higher than those of arm symptoms. Overall, the mean level of both types of symptoms decreased during follow-up. A body mass index (BMI) of 25 or greater and breast symptoms at eight months were associated with having breast symptoms at two years. Arm symptoms at baseline and at eight months, and radiation therapy and a BMI of 25 or greater were associated with having arm symptoms at two years.CONCLUSIONS: Breast symptoms show different patterns of change and are not associated with the same factors as arm symptoms.IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: For nurses monitoring women treated for breast cancer, the results of this study provide knowledge regarding the importance of early symptom identification and long-term symptoms after treatment.",Excluded,0.95084
834,"Repeat intracoronary radiation for recurrent in-stent restenosis in patients who failed intracoronary radiation BACKGROUND: Intracoronary radiation therapy (IRT) is the only proven treatment for in-stent restenosis (ISR). It is, however, associated with a significant failure rate. The present study evaluated the outcomes of patients who underwent repeat intracoronary radiation for recurrent ISR.METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-one consecutive patients who failed a previous radiation treatment, presented with angina and angiographic evidence of ISR, and were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and repeat radiation to the same segment were studied. Twenty-five patients were treated with gamma radiation in a dose of 15 Gy, and 26 were treated with beta radiation doses of 18.3 to 23 Gy. The mean cumulative dose for this cohort was 39.5+/-11.9 Gy (range, 29 to 75.6 Gy). The outcomes of those patients were compared with outcomes of 299 patients who also failed initial radiation but were treated with repeat conventional PCI to a previously irradiated segment without repeat radiation. At 9 months after treatment, the repeat-IRT group had lower rates of target lesion revascularization (23.5% versus 54.6%; P<0.001) and major adverse cardiac events, including target vessel revascularization (29.4% versus 61.3%; P<0.001). At 9 months, patients with repeat IRT were free of angiographic and clinical events related to the radiation therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Repeat gamma or beta radiation to treat failed IRT for ISR after conventional PCI is safe and effective at 9 months and should be considered as a therapeutic option for this difficult patient subset.",Excluded,0.9498597

With regard to treatment, the focus of attention has shifted in the last decade from pure survival rates to health-related quality of life. HRQOL is affected differently by different treatments. The objective of this study is to assess the HRQOL related to treatment regime and time since diagnosis in Dutch men with prostate cancer. We conducted a cross-sectional study among 238 men with prostate cancer in a heterogeneous sample who filled in a general health-related quality-of-life measure (EORTC-QLQ-C30) and a prostate cancer specific quality-of-life instrument (the EORTC-QLQ-PR25) and a Joy-of-Life questionnaire. Men on hormonal treatment are doing worse compared with other treatments with respect to physical functioning, role functioning, fatigue, pain and sexual functioning. No differences were found between radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy on any of the HRQOL dimensions nor for time since diagnosis.

[Turkish] OBJECTIVES To evaluate the treatment results and prognostic factors in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer patients, retrospectively. METHODS Fifty-two patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer treated between 2005 and 2012, in our hospital were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS The 2-year overall survival and disease free survival rates were 48% and 15%. On univariate analysis T1 tumor (p=.012), concomittant chemoradiotherapy (p=.023), start of radiotherapy within the 3 months after diagnosis (p=.026) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (p=.025) significantly improved disease free survival rate. Concomittant chemoradiotherapy (p<.001), early radiotherapy (p<.001) and prophylactic cranial irradiaton (p=.001) significantly affected overall survival rate. On multivariate analysis, only prophylactic cranial irradiation was found to be an independent factor affecting overall survival rate (p=.003). CONCLUSION Our results were consistent with the literature even though small sample size. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was determined the only independent factor that affects overall survival.

42,"A reappraisal of the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited small cell lung cancer The use of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited stage small cell lung cancer remains controversial. Prospective trials have demonstrated that PCI can reduce central nervous system relapse rates, but the impact on survival remains questionable except for the possible evidence of a beneficial effect for long term survivors. With higher rates of thoracic control now obtainable with hyperfractionated radiation and concomitant chemotherapy, it becomes important to analyze the benefit of PCI in that setting. Before 1982, we included PCI in the management of all patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer; thereafter, we discontinued its use. This report compares the outcome of the two treatment approaches and addresses the role of PCI among patients who achieve durable local control. There were 36 limited stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with PCI from 1979-1982 and 26 patients treated without PCI from 1985-1989. Induction chemotherapy was followed in both groups by thoracic irradiation (45 Gy). The PCI patients received 30 Gy to the whole brain in 10 fractions. Both groups received maintenance chemotherapy. Of complete responders, brain failure was the first failure in 18% (4/22) of PCI (+) versus 45% (10/22) of PCI (-) (p = .04). Survival at 2 years was 42% for PCI (+) versus 13% for PCI (-) (p less than .05). When the analysis was limited to those patients permanently controlled in the thorax; there were 25% (4/16) brain failures PCI (+) versus 70% (7/10) PCI (-) (p = .03). For this same subset the 2-year survival was 56% PCI (+) versus 14% PCI (-) (p less than .05). There were no 5 year survivors without PCI compared to 38% (6/16) with PCI. These data suggest that PCI appears to be effective in enhancing survival of patients who achieve durable thoracic control. Prospective trials are necessary to evaluate the use of PCI combined with therapeutic regimens with a documented ability to achieve high rates of sustained control of thoracic disease.",Excluded,0.9428034

835,"Role of short TE 1H-MR spectroscopy in monitoring of post-operation irradiated patients Post-surgical radiation therapy is a routine procedure in the treatment of primary malignant brain tumors. Along with modest therapeutic effects conventional fractionated radiotherapy, in spite of any modifications, produces damage to non-malignant brain tissues lying within the treatment volume, the extent of which depends on radiation dose. Serial 1H-MRS allows non-invasive investigation of tissue metabolic profiles. In the present study the ratios of resonance signals assigned to the major 1H-MRS-visible metabolites (N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine, inositol, lactate and lipid methylene group) were evaluated before, during and after post-surgical fractionated radiotherapy in brain regions close to and more distant from the tumor bed, receiving different radiation exposures (60 and < 40 Gy, respectively). The study group consisted of ten patients (aged 28-51). A MRI/MRS system (Elscint 2T Prestige) operating at the field strength of 2 T and the proton resonance frequency of 81.3 MHz has been used and the 1H-MR spectra were acquired using single voxel double-spin-echo PRESS sequence with a short TE. The spectra were post-processed with automatic fitting in the frequency domain. It was found that although the metabolite profiles depend on the dose obtained, but other stress factors (like surgery) seem to contribute to the overall picture of the metabolic status of the brain as well. In studies of early irradiation injuries, an increase of choline related ratios may serve rather as cell proliferation indictors than as cell injury ones, whereas the mI/Cr ratio appears as one of the first indicators of local irradiation injury. In order to establish the prognostic marker for early radiation damage, however, it seems necessary to analyze all visible metabolites as well. None of the metabolites separately may serve as such an indicator due to the complexity of tissue metabolism. Interestingly, MRI reveals no changes during the therapy process, whereas the metabolite ratios are being affected in the course of time, thus supporting the presumption that the 1H-MRS is a valuable method of radiation therapy monitoring.",Excluded,0.929516
500,"Hematologic variables associated with brain failure in patients with small-cell lung cancer Background and purpose: We sought factors associated with the development of brain metastases after treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in patients without brain involvement at diagnosis. Method(s): We analyzed 293 patients with SCLC without brain metastases who received chemotherapy, thoracic radiation therapy (TRT), or both in 2001-2015. Pretreatment hematologic markers (platelet count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and lactate dehydrogenase) and other clinical characteristics were evaluated for correlation with brain metastases-free survival (BMFS). Cutoffs were established with receiver operating characteristics curves. Factors significant in univariate analysis were used to build a multivariate Cox model for BMFS. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 14.3 months. Brain metastases developed in 115 patients (39%)-32% of those with low pretreatment platelet counts (PPC) (<=270 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and 46% of those with high PPC (>270 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Median BMFS time for all patients was 27.9 months. Two-year BMFS rates were worse for patients with high PPC (14.6% vs. 22.1% low, P = 0.009). High PPC was independently associated with inferior BMFS (P = 0.038), as were receipt of TRT <45 Gy and no prophylactic cranial irradiation (both P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): High PPC was associated with increased rates of brain metastasis in patients with SCLC with no evidence of brain disease at diagnosis. Copyright Â© 2018",Excluded,0.92493814
281,"Fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy improves symptoms from cranial neuropathies in base of skull meningiomas: The Jefferson experience Purpose/Objective(s): Skull base meningiomas commonly present with cranial neuropathies and are difficult to manage due to their location.We review the experience at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital using fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT) in the management of these patients with a focus on symptom outcomes. Materials/Methods:We identified 219 patients who were treated with FSRT for base of skull meningioma from 1/1/1994 through 3/1/2009. Seven patients received a second course of radiation therapy. We analyzed each treatment course separately, and classified treatments into four groups: RT only, adjuvant RT, RT for progression after surgery, and Re-irradiation after progression (with or without prior surgery). Symptoms were classified based on the cranial nerve affected. The gross target volume (GTV) was defined by T1-weighted MRI with contrast without inclusion of dural tails. The median prescription dose was 52.2 Gy (range 10 - 60 Gy). Patients were treated using multi-isocenter plans (median 79% isodose line) until 2004, and subsequently with single isocenter plans (median 90% isodose line). Cox proportional hazards models were used to indentify factors associated with progression, and multiple logistic regression was used to identify predictors of symptom improvement. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 3.1 years. Of 226 FSRT treatment courses, 116 were in the (51%) RT only group, 40 (18%) in the adjuvant RT group, 59 (26%) in the RT for progression after surgery group, and 11 (5%) in the re-irradiation after progression group. Patients were symptomatic at the time of radiation in 92% of cases. The most common symptoms were visual field and/or acuity deficits (55%), impaired extra-ocular movements (32%), and facial numbness (20%). Twenty-one patients progressed after FSRT. Local control rate at 5 years was 95.4% in the RTonly group, 89.8% in the adjuvant group (p=0.98), 74.3% in the progression after surgery group (p = 0.02), and 50% in the re-irradiation group (p<0.01). On multivariate analysis, prior radiation therapy (HR 3.68 p = 0.045) and midline/bilateral location (HR 2.65 p = 0.04) were significant predictors of progression; of note, treatment volume, fraction size and dose did not predict for progression. Of all patients symptomatic at presentation, 50.7% had subjective improvement in at least one symptom, and occurred at a median of 4.0 months. These improvements were durable in 82%-100% of cases, depending on cranial nerve involved. Only prior surgery (OR 0.48 95% CI 0.28 - 0.81) was associated with symptom improvement.

Autopsy findings in 15 of these patients are reported. Ten patients received pituitary radiation (average dose, 116 Gy in six fractions) for progressive neovascularization retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus. Evidence of a time-dependent course of progressive fibrosis in their pituitary glands was found. Five patients were treated for eosinophilic adenomas. Although they had lower average doses of radiation (56 Gy in six fractions), their pituitary glands showed cystic cavitation of the adenomas. The adenomas thus appeared more radiosensitive than the normal pars anterior, which, in turn, was more radiosensitive than the adjacent neurohypophysis. No significant radiation changes were found in the surrounding brain or cranial nerves. The endocrine organs under pituitary control showed varying degrees of atrophy, and clinical tests revealed progressive hypofunction. It was concluded that charged-particle therapy produced a sharply delineated focal radiation lesion confined to the pituitary gland but did not cause injury to the critical structures of the surrounding central nervous system.",Excluded,0.92360485

The aim of this study is to determine if the deferral of brain radiotherapy impacts patient outcomes.METHODS: Between May 2003 and December 2015, a total of 198 patients with brain metastases from NSCLC who received both brain radiotherapy and systemic therapy (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) were identified. The rate of grade 3-4 adverse reactions related to chemotherapy and radiotherapy had no significant difference between two groups. 127 patients received concurrent brain radiotherapy and systemic therapy, and 71 patients received deferred brain radiotherapy after at least two cycles of chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Disease specific-graded prognostic assessment was similar in early radiotherapy group and deferred radiotherapy group.RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) was longer in early radiotherapy group compared to deferred radiotherapy group (17.9 months vs 12.6 months; P=0.038). Progression free survival (PFS) was also improved in patients receiving early radiotherapy compared to those receiving deferred radiotherapy (4.0 months vs 3.0 months; P<0.01). Receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy after the diagnosis of brain metastases as any line therapy improved the OS (20.0 months vs 10.7 months; P<0.01), whereas receiving TKI as first line therapy did not (17.9 months vs 15.2 months; P=0.289).CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the use of deferred brain radiotherapy may resulted in inferior OS in patients with NSCLC who develop brain metastases.

This approach creates a regression tree according to prognostic variables which partitions into homogenous subsets according to survival. Four protocols, RTOG 83-11, 83-21, 84-03 and 84-07 were analyzed. 83-11 and 84-07 were studies utilizing irradiation with 'alterfractionation; 83-21 and 84-03 were studies evaluating thymocin with irradiation and prophylactic cranial irradiation with thoracic irradiation respectively. Nine pretreatment variables and one treatment variable were analyzed. Adjustment for radiotherapy effect was made in the accelerated treatment protocol (84-07). Overall, median survival for the entire group was 9.0 months with 17% alive at 2 years. Univariate analysis suggests that KPS, <=70 vs. 80-100, pleural effusion, weight loss, <=5% vs. 5%, age, 60 + vs. < 60, T stage (T1 and T2 vs. T3 and T4) and N stage (N- vs. N +) were important prognastic factors. Radiation dose, sex, race and histology were not univariate prognastic factors. RPA identified KPS as the most significant covariate (median survival 5.9 mos. <= 70 vs. 9.9 mos. 80-100). Within KPS 80-100 other splits occurred for N stage, age, weight loss and radiation therapy dose. KPS 170 split at pleural effusion only. The best overall RPA tree has four distinct classes with median survival times ranging from 3.3 to 12.6 months. The RPA classes were validated in an independent non-small cell lung cancer dataset.

During the healing period, 20 implants did not successfully integrate, whereas 168 implants were classified as success (including both survival and success rates). The analysis of implant subgroups showed slightly more favorable cumulative success rate for mandibular implants (98.4%) compared with maxillary implants (57.1%) and clearly better success rate for a radiation dosage minor of 50-Gy doses.

Black race was associated with improved LT signs at significantly lower cumulative RT doses (P=0.027). Larger uninvolved brainstem volume alone and normalized to total brain (TB) or posterior fossa volume (PF) was associated with a shorter time to LT sign improvement (P=0.044, P=0.033, and P=0.05, respectively). Patients with any improvement in CN experienced significantly prolonged progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (P=0.002 and P=0.008, respectively). Tumor volume, with or without normalization to TB or PF, was not significantly associated with PFS or OS. CONCLUSION(S): Low cumulative doses of RT provided neurologic improvement in the majority of patients with DIPG. Brain sub-region volumes influenced time to symptomatic improvement, while neurologic improvement was associated with superior survival outcomes.",Excluded,0.9073683

667,"Behind and beyond the masaoka staging: A 25-year follow-up study of tumor recurrence in completely resected thymic epithelial tumors in a single institution We analyzed prognosticators for recurrence and post-recurrence survival in completely resected thymic epithelial tumors for the past 25 years in a single institution. Between June 1988 and December 2013, 238 patients undergoing intent-to-treat surgery for thymic epithelial tumors were reviewed. Sex, age, myasthenia gravis (MG), tumor histology, Masaoka staging, characteristic of locoregional invasion and recurrence, and the treatment for recurrence were collected. Comparison between groups was conducted using the Student t test and x2 test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors. One hundred sixteen of 135 patients with completely resected thymoma and 35 of 56 patients with thymic carcinoma remained free of recurrence. In patients with completely resected thymoma, Masaoka staging, MG, tumor invasion into the lung, pericardium, and innominate vein or superior vena cava (SVC) invasion were associated with recurrence-free survival in univariate analysis (P=0.004, 0.003, 0.001, 0.007, and 0.039, respectively). In multivariate analysis, MG was the positive independent prognosticator (P=0.039). In patients with completely resected thymic carcinoma, Masaoka staging and innominate vein or SVC invasion were associated with recurrence-free survival in univariate analysis (P=0.045 and 0.005, respectively), whereas innominate vein or SVC invasion was the negative independent prognosticator (P=0.012). In patients with recurrent thymoma, those treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy had a significantly better post-recurrence survival than those undergoing chemoradiotherapy (P=0.029) and those without treatment (P=0.007). Patients with recurrent thymic carcinoma undergoing surgery followed by chemotherapy had a significantly better post-recurrence survival than those without treatment (P=0.004), but not significantly better than those undergoing chemoradiotherapy (P=0.252). In patients with completely resected thymoma, MG was the positive independent prognosticators of recurrence-free survival. Surgery should be attempted for recurrent disease for better post-recurrence survival. In patients with completely resected thymic carcinoma, innominate vein or SVC invasion was the negative independent prognosticator. Surgery for recurrence could be considered since it provided benefit for postrecurrence survival as chemoradiotherapy did. Copyright Â© 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

524,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation for patients with limited disease small cell lung cancer in complete remission. [Japanese] Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients with small cell lung cancer has been performed in many countries. While a consensus that PCI decreased the rate of tumor recurrence in the brain has been obtained, the survival advantage of PCI remains controversial. To improve results of PCI, a retrospective study was carried out. Twenty-five patients and 16 patients underwent PCI with doses of 24 Gy (accelerated hyperfractionation) and 30 Gy. Overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 60% and 26% for the patients with a dose of 24 Gy, and 33% and 20% for those with a dose of 30 Gy, respectively. Brain metastasis as the first relapse site was 16% and 13% for the patients with doses of 24 Gy and 30 Gy, and brain metastasis as the only relapse site was 12% and 6%, respectively. As prognostic factors, there were significant differences between patients with less than 65 years of age and 65 or more, and between patients with stage IIIa and stage IIIB. A prospective randomized study with more strict patient selection (stage III A disease) and appropriate dose (27-30Gy) for PCI may prove that PCI provides significant survival benefit.",Excluded,0.90522265
991,"Clinical outcome and prognostic factors for central neurocytoma Purpose/Objective(s): Central neurocytomas are intraventricular neoplasms of the central nervous system that comprise 0.25- 0.5% of brain tumors and their optimal management remains controversial due to their rarity. We assessed clinical outcome for a historical cohort of neurocytoma patients and evaluated effects of tumor atypia, tumor size, extent of resection (EOR), and adjuvant radiation (RT). Materials/Methods: Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from date of first surgical resection. Differences in PFS were measured by Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazard ratio methods. Tumor atypia was defined as MIB-1 index >2%, focal necrosis, or microvascular proliferation, as previously established. Result(s): A total of 22 patients (14 males, 8 females) were treated between 1995 and 2009, with a median age at diagnosis of 24 years (range 11-62). A total of 8 patients experienced recurrent/progressive disease. Median follow-up by MRI was 38 month (range 0.1-183) for those who have not progressed. Overall 3-yr PFS was 70% (CI 41-86%). Only three patients died and all had atypical tumors. For the remaining patients, median follow-up for survival was 51 month (range 0.1-183). We examined effects of tumor atypia and MIB-1 labeling. Ten of 22 tumors had atypical features. There was near 100% concordance between tumor atypia and MIB-1 labeling: only 1 tumor was atypical based on microvascular proliferation but had MIB-1 <= 2%. Three-year PFS was 78% for MIB labeling <= 2% and 39% for MIB labeling >2% (HR 7.7, CI 2 - 40, p = 0.016). Median tumor diameter was 4.3 cm (range 0.8-8.6 cm). Three-yr PFS was 48% (CI 21-77%) for tumor >4.3 cm and 74.1% (CI 29-93%) for tumor <=4.3 cm (HR 1.6, CI 0.5 - 6.6, p = 0.49). We examined influence of EOR and adjuvant RT. Five patients had gross total resection (GTR), and 17 had subtotal resection (STR). No patient had a biopsy only. Seven patients progressed after STR, and one patient recurred after GTR. None of the GTR patients received adjuvant RT and four of the STR patients received adjuvant RT. Three-year PFS rates by extent of resection and adjuvant RT are shown (in table below). Conclusion(s): For patients with central neurocytoma, MIB-1 labeling index >2% significantly predicts worse outcome. The additional criteria for tumor atypia did not add useful prognostic information. Although patient numbers are too small for conclusive confirmation, our data indicate that lesser EOR and larger tumors size may confer worse prognosis and adjuvant RTafter STR may improve PFS.

533,"Evaluation of QOL and psychological response in patients treated with palliative radiotherapy Purpose or Objective Usually, evaluation of palliative radiotherapy is made by physical findings or levels of pain relief. But little is known about patient quality of life (QOL), psychophysiological response, and assessment of adverse effect from the view point of QOL. We evaluated the effects of palliative radiotherapy for cancer recurrence or metastasis on patient QOL and psychophysiology. Material and Methods A total of 67 patients who received palliative radiotherapy between 2014 and 2015 were enrolled. Patient diseases were bone metastasis in 51 patients, lymph node metastasis in 7 patients, brain metastasis in 2 patients, local recurrence in 3 patients, and the others in 4 patients. Median irradiated dose was 30 Gy in 10 fractions for palliative radiotherapy. We used the questionnaires EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-C15-PAL to evaluate patient QOL and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate patient mental healthcare at the start and at the end of radiotherapy. Results As compared to scores at the start of radiotherapy, at the end of radiotherapy, numerical rating scale (NRS) and face scale significantly decreased. On the other hand, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) did not show no changes during palliative radiotherapy. In functional scales, average scores of role functioning (RF2) and emotional functioning (EF) also improved. In symptom scales, average scores of fatigue (FA), pain (PA), and insomnia (SL) improved. In bone metastasis group, global health status / QOL (QL2), PA, and SL significantly improved. After palliative radiotherapy, anxiety score of HADS was elevated below age of 70 years. There was relationship between anxiety improvement and QOL improvement after palliative radiotherapy. Nausea and vomiting scores of EORTC-QLQC15- PAL were associated with the irradiated volume of palliative radiotherapy for pelvic region. Conclusion Patient QOL of was improved by palliative radiotherapy regardless of PS. The possibility of palliative radiotherapy having a positive influence on patient psychophysiology was also suggested in younger age.",Excluded,0.8999685
208,"Modulation of acute coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis in gamma-irradiated rats by transfer of naive lymphocyte subsets before infection Clinical course, recovery of infectious virus from brain tissue and histopathology of the central nervous system were examined in gamma-irradiated Lewis rats reconstituted by naive lymphocytes before infection with coronavirus MHV-4 (strain JHM). Up to 9 days past infection, no differences were seen between immunologically competent and immuno-deficient animals in terms of onset and progression of neurological disease. However, in the latter animals neurological symptoms were dominated by signs of encephalitis instead of paralytic disease as usually seen in immunocompetent animals. Nevertheless, despite high titers of infectious virus in the CNS of immunodeficient animals only mild histopathological changes were noticeable. In contrast, infectious virus in the CNS of immunologically competent animals was below the detection limit of the assay. Paralytic disease and tissue destruction were T lymphocyte mediated because gamma-irradiated rats that were reconstituted by CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocyte enriched cells in the absence of B lymphocytes revealed an earlier onset of clinical symptoms and a more rapid deterioration of their clinical state compared to fully competent animals. Whereas in CD4+ T cell reconstituted animals infectious virus was moderately reduced and tissue destruction as well as inflammatory changes in the CNS were focal, in CD8+ T cell reconstituted animals vacuolizing white matter inflammation was diffuse without reduction of infectious virus in brain tissue. From the presented data we conclude that in the acute stage of JHMV-induced encephalomyelitis of Lewis rats: (i) tissue destruction and paralytic clinical symptomatology are mainly T cell-mediated; (ii) CD4+ T lymphocytes can directly contribute to reduction of viral load in the brain and (iii) only coordinated action of both, the T and the B cell compartment enables animals to survive the infection and recover from disease.",Excluded,0.89829785
1168,"Postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery for resected brain metastases: A comparison of outcomes for large resection cavities PURPOSE: Although historical trials have established the role of surgical resection followed by whole brain irradiation (WBRT) for brain metastases, WBRT has recently been shown to cause significant neurocognitive decline. Many practitioners have employed postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to tumor resection cavities to increase local control without causing significant neurocognitive sequelae. However, studies analyzing outcomes of large brain metastases treated with resection and postoperative SRS are lacking. Here we compare outcomes in patients with large brain metastases >4 cm to those with smaller metastases <=4 cm treated with surgical resection followed by SRS to the resection cavity.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Consecutive patients with brain metastases treated at our institution with surgical resection and postoperative SRS were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified into <=4 cm and >4 cm cohorts based on preoperative maximal tumor dimension. Cumulative incidence of local failure, radiation necrosis, and death were analyzed for the 2 cohorts using a competing-risk model, defined as the time from SRS treatment date to the measured event, death, or last follow-up.RESULTS: A total of 117 consecutive cases were identified. Of these patients, 90 (77%) had preoperative tumors <=4 cm, and 27 (23%) >4 cm in greatest dimension. The only significant baseline difference between the 2 groups was a higher proportion of patients who underwent gross total resection in the <=4 cm compared with the >4 cm cohort, 76% versus 48%, respectively (P <.01). The 1-year rates of local failure, radiation necrosis, and overall survival for the <=4 cm and >4 cm cohorts were 12.3% and 16.0%, 26.9% and 28.4%, and 80.6% and 67.6%, respectively (all P >.05). The rates of local failure and radiation necrosis were not statistically different on multivariable analysis based on tumor size.CONCLUSIONS: Brain metastases >4 cm in largest dimension managed by resection and radiosurgery to the tumor cavity have promising local control rates without a significant increase in radiation necrosis on our retrospective review.",Excluded,0.893587

132,"Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors: The Impact of Treatment on Patient Outcome Primary central nervous system (CNS) germinoma is readily curable with relatively large volume/high dose radiotherapy but the late effects of treatment may alter neurocognitive functioning and quality of life. Prior studies have associated radiation therapy with deficits in the domains of intelligence, attention, memory, and psychomotor processing speed, with risk factors including young age at irradiation and increased irradiation volume and dosage level. Furthermore, cranial irradiation may also lead to diminished height, neuroendocrine dysfunction, and hearing loss. Few germ cell tumor follow-up studies have adequately examined the late effects of therapy, with results varying between lowered physical quality of life without significant cognitive sequelae to significant correlations between young age at treatment and lowered levels of intellectual functioning and quality of life. Consequently, further investigation is warranted that includes baseline and biannual psychological assessments that focus beyond a singular measure of intelligence and provide data on a range of domains such as attention-concentration, memory and executive functioning, as well as quality of life, social-emotional and behavioral functioning. Since systemic and CNS germ cell tumors are highly sensitive to chemotherapy as well as to radiotherapy, future studies should examine whether the addition of chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy will permit response-based reductions in radiotherapy fields and allow the administration of doses that will translate into meaningful improvements in functional outcome with preservation of excellent long-term disease control.",Excluded,0.8831585

1139,"Both anti-HER2 treatment and chemotherapy after whole-brain radiation therapy improve survival in patients with brain metastases from HER2-positive breast cancer Purpose/Objective(s): Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) remains the most widely used treatment for brain metastasis (BM) from breast cancer (BC), especially for pts with multiple intracranial lesions. Growing evidence has suggested that systemic treatment can improve survival in addition to WBRT. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of post- WBRT anti-HER2 and other systemic treatments on survival after BM from Her-2 positive BC. Materials/Methods: A total of 54 pts with BM from HER2-positive BC treated with WBRT in single institute between January 2006 and February 2012 was retrospectively analyzed, 42 pts (77.8%) had multiple lesions. The brain was the first metastatic site for 15 pts (27.8%). Post-WBRT anti- HER2 treatment was given in 21 pts (38.9%), 9 pts received trastuzumab, 9 pts received lapatinib and the other 3 received both trastuzumab and lapatinib. Post-WBRT chemotherapy was given in 39 pts, 19 in combination with anti-HER2 treatment. Prognostic analysis was performed including age at BM, KPS/RPA, ER/PR status, number of BM, interval between BC diagnosis and BM, presence of extracranial metastases, extracranial metastases control, chemotherapy after WBRT and anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT. Radiation dose of EQD2 <=40 Gy (a/s=4.6 Gy) was given in 26 pts (74.3%). Result(s): The median interval from diagnosis of BC to the identification of BM was 29 months (range, 2-136 months). In univariate analysis, age, KPS/RPA classes, number of BM, extracranial metastases control, chemotherapy after WBRT and anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT were significant prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) (p < 0.05). While in multivariate analysis, extracranial metastases control, chemotherapy after WBRT and anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT were significant prognostic factors for OS. No impact of radiation doses and ER/PR status on OS were found. The median survival for the whole group was 12 months, which was 21 and 9 months, respectively (p=0.004) in pts with and without anti- HER2 treatment after WBRT, 16 and 6 months in pts with and without chemotherapy (p < 0.001).

METHOD(S): Using a large US medical claims database, patients were identified between 2005 and 2010 using =2 melanoma diagnoses (ICD-9-CM: 172.xx, V10.82) and=2 diagnoses for metastasis (ICD-9-CM: 197.xx, 198.xx). The index date was the first date of metastasis diagnosis. Patients were followed from the index date to death, disenrollment, or end of the study period (6/30/2010), whichever occurred first. Surgery, radiation, and systemic therapies were examined descriptively. Factors influencing treatment were examined using a logistic regression separately for surgery, radiation, and systemic therapy. RESULT(S): A total of 2546 patients with metastatic melanoma were included in the analyses. Mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 60.6 (+/- 14.0) years old with 22.8% under 50 and 36.5% were female. Overall, 66.8% of patients had cancer treatment related surgery, 38.7% received systemic therapies, 44.7% received radiation, and 17.7% of patients received all three treatments. Logistic regressions revealed that patients with lung (p <0.0001), brain (p <0.0001), liver (p <0.0001), or bone (p <0.0001) metastases were less likely to have surgeries; patients with lung (p = 0.04), brain (p < 0.001), or liver metastases (p = 0.03) were more likely to receive systemic therapies; as expected patients with brain (p < 0.0001) or bone metastases (p < 0.0001) were more likely to have radiation therapy. Patients being treated by oncologists were more likely to receive systemic therapy (p < 0.0001) or radiation (p < 0.0001) while patients being treated by dermatologists were more likely to receive surgery subsequently (p = 0.002). Older age and female gender were associated with a lower likelihood to receive surgery, systemic, or radiation therapy.

Expert listeners rated voice and speech quality (based on Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain), articulation (overall, [p], [t], [k]), and comparative mean opinion scores of voice and speech at three assessment points calculated. A structured study-specific questionnaire evaluated patients' perception pretreatment (N=55), at 10-week (N=49) and 1-year posttreatment (N=37).RESULTS: At 10 weeks, perceptual voice quality is significantly affected. The parameters overall voice quality (mean, -0.24; P=0.008), strain (mean, -0.12; P=0.012), nasality (mean, -0.08; P=0.009), roughness (mean, -0.22; P=0.001), and pitch (mean, -0.03; P=0.041) improved over time but not beyond baseline levels, except for asthenia at 1-year posttreatment (voice is less asthenic than at baseline; mean, +0.20; P=0.03). Perceptual analyses of articulation showed no significant differences. Patients judge their voice quality as good (score, 18/20) at all assessment points, but at 1-year posttreatment, most of them (70%) judge their ""voice not as it used to be."" In the 1-year versus 10-week posttreatment comparison, the larynx-hypopharynx tumor group was more strained, whereas nonlarynx tumor voices were judged less strained (mean, -0.33 and +0.07, respectively; P=0.031). Patients' perceived changes in voice and speech quality at 10-week post- versus pretreatment correlate weakly with expert judgments.CONCLUSION: Overall, perceptual CCRT effects on voice and speech seem to peak at 10-week posttreatment but level off at 1-year posttreatment.

In studies investigating methylation and the role of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, the effect of this treatment upon the methylation itself is not well understood. We aimed to investigate any differences in methylation before or after treatment. Method(s): Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer were identified. Tumour tissue from pretreatment biopsies and post treatment resections for the same patients was subjected to DNA extraction. This was also modelled in vitro by administering ionizing radiation (7-15 Gy) to a colorectal cancer cell line and extracting DNA 48 hour later. Methylation specific PCR was used to characterize the methylation status of CpG islands in the promoter regions of 8 genes associated with rectal cancer. PCR band size and intensity was measured to give a semiquantiative analysis of methylation intensity in the cell line experiment. Result(s): 17 patients underwent analysis. Methylation was seen less frequently in post treatment specimens for all 8 markers, however, this difference was significant for one marker (ADAMTS1, 10/17 methylated pre vs 0/17 post, P = 0.001) and approached significance for another (hMLH1, 6/17 vs 1/17, P = 0.08). In the cell line study, methylation band intensity was significantly reduced above a dose of 10 Gy for both ADAMTS1 (P = 0.05) and NEUROG1 (P < 0.05) markers.

However, observation periods were not long enough to allow confirmation of the long-term safety of SRS alone in patients with 5 to 10 BMs.METHODS AND MATERIALS: This was a prospective observational study of Gamma Knife SRS-treated patients with 1 to 10 newly diagnosed BMs enrolled at 23 facilities between March 1, 2009, and February 15, 2012.RESULTS: The 1194 eligible patients were categorized into the following groups: group A, 1 tumor (n=455); group B, 2 to 4 tumors (n=531); and group C, 5 to 10 tumors (n=208). Cumulative rates of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score maintenance (MMSE score decrease <3 from baseline) determined with a competing risk analysis of groups A, B, and C were 93%, 91%, and 92%, respectively, at the 12th month after SRS; 91%, 89%, and 91%, respectively, at the 24th month; 89%, 88%, and 89%, respectively, at the 36th month; and 87%, 86%, and 89%, respectively, at the 48th month (hazard ratio [HR] of group A vs group B, 0.719; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.437-1.172; P=.18; HR of group B vs group C, 1.280; 95% CI, 0.696-2.508; P=.43). During observations ranging from 0.3 to 67.5 months (median, 12.0 months; interquartile range, 5.8-26.5 months), as of December 2014, 145 patients (12.1%) had SRS-induced complications. Cumulative complication incidences by competing risk analysis for groups A, B, and C were 7%, 8%, and 6%, respectively, at the 12th month after SRS; 10%, 11%, and 11%, respectively, at the 24th month; 11%, 11%, and 12%, respectively, at the 36th month; and 12%, 12%, and 13%, respectively, at the 48th month (HR of group A vs group B, 0.850; 95% CI, 0.592-1.220; P=.38; HR of group B vs group C, 1.052; 95% CI, 0.666-1.662, P=.83).

Method(s): Through a special study mechanism of the National Cancer Database, we randomly selected 9668 patients with surgically resected stage I-III NSCLC in 2006-07 from 1147 cancer facilities. Registrars reabstracted detailed preoperative comorbidity, recurrence, and treatment information to supplement existing data. Patients were stratified by recurrence status and predictors of active treatment vs supportive care only were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. Result(s): Median age at diagnosis was 67 (IQR 60-74). The most common comorbidities were COPD (40%) and CAD (21%). After 5-year median follow up, 62% had no recurrence, 11% had locoregional, and 27% had distant recurrence. Among those with locoregional recurrence, 79% received treatment (28% chemo, 25% chemo/radiation, 16% radiation, 10% surgery); 21% received supportive care only. Older patients (adjusted OR 0.73 per decade, p = .0008) and those with substance abuse (aOR 0.41, p = .008) were less likely to receive treatment. Women and patients with symptomatic or ipsilateral lung recurrence (vs lymph node) were also less likely to receive treatment (all p < .02). Among those with distant recurrence, 77% received treatment (30% radiation, 23% chemo, 13% chemo/radiation, 11% surgery); 23% received supportive care only. Older patients were less likely to receive treatment (aOR 0.75, p = .0001) while those without any comorbidities were more likely to receive treatment (aOR 1.65, p = .018). Metastatic site also predicted treatment: contralateral lung or liver metastases decreased the odds of treatment while brain or bone metastases increased the odds (all p < .05). Conclusion(s): Older patients, independent of comorbidity, were less likely to receive treatment for both locoregional and distant NSCLC recurrence. In contrast, the impact of comorbidity was stronger for distant recurrence, highlighting the importance of avoiding over treatment in the palliative setting.",Excluded,0.84979355
241,"Local tumor progression treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery: Differences between patients with 2-4 versus 5-10 brain metastases based on an update of a multi-institutional prospective observational study (JLGK0901) OBJECTIVE The Japanese Leksell Gamma Knife (JLGK)0901 study proved the efficacy of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in patients with 5-10 brain metastases (BMs) as compared to those with 2-4, showing noninferiority in overall survival and other secondary endpoints. However, the difference in local tumor progression between patients with 2-4 and those with 5-10 BMs has not been sufficiently examined for this data set. Thus, the authors reappraised this issue, employing the updated JLGK0901 data set with detailed observation via enhanced MRI. They applied sophisticated statistical methods to analyze the data. METHODS This was a prospective observational study of 1194 patients harboring 1-10 BMs treated with GKRS alone. Patients were categorized into groups A (single BM, 455 cases), B (2-4 BMs, 531 cases), and C (5-10 BMs, 208 cases). Local tumor progression was defined as a 20% increase in the maximum diameter of the enhanced lesion as compared to its smallest documented maximum diameter on enhanced MRI. The authors compared cumulative incidence differences determined by competing risk analysis and also conducted propensity score matching. RESULTS Local tumor progression was observed in 212 patients (17.8% overall, groups A/B/C: 93/89/30 patients). Cumulative incidences of local tumor progression in groups A, B, and C were 15.2%, 10.6%, and 8.7% at 1 year after GKRS; 20.1%, 16.9%, and 13.5% at 3 years; and 21.4%, 17.4%, and not available at 5 years, respectively. There were no significant differences in local tumor progression between groups B and C. Local tumor progression was classified as tumor recurrence in 139 patients (groups A/B/C: 68/53/18 patients), radiation necrosis in 67 (24/31/12), and mixed/ undetermined lesions in 6 (1/5/0). There were no significant differences in tumor recurrence or radiation necrosis between groups B and C. Multivariate analysis using the Fine-Gray proportional hazards model revealed age < 65 years, neurological symptoms, tumor volume >= 1 cm<sup>3</sup>, and prescription dose < 22 Gy to be significant poor prognostic factors for local tumor progression. In the subset of 558 case-matched patients (186 in each group), there were no significant differences between groups B and C in local tumor progression, nor in tumor recurrence or radiation necrosis. CONCLUSIONS Local tumor progression incidences did not differ between groups B and C. This study proved that tumor progression after GKRS without whole-brain radiation therapy for patients with 5-10 BMs was satisfactorily treated with the doses prescribed according to the JLGK0901 study protocol and that results were not inferior to those in patients with a single or 2-4 BMs. Copyright Â© AANS 2020, except where prohibited by US copyright law.",Excluded,0.8483396
423,"Prospective Comparison of Toxicity and Cosmetic Outcome After Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation With Conformal External Beam Radiotherapy or Single-Entry Multilumen Intracavitary Brachytherapy PURPOSE: This study aimed to prospectively characterize toxicity and cosmesis after accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (CRT) or single-entry, multilumen, intracavitary brachytherapy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 281 patients with pTis, pT1N0, or pT2N0 (<=3.0 cm) breast cancer treated with segmental mastectomy were prospectively enrolled from December 2008 through August 2014. APBI was delivered using 3-dimensional CRT (n = 29) or with SAVI (n = 176), Contura (n = 56), or MammoSite (n = 20) brachytherapy catheters. Patients were evaluated at protocol-specified intervals, at which time the radiation oncologist scored cosmetic outcome, toxicities, and recurrence status using a standardized template.RESULTS: The median follow-up time is 41 months. Grade 1 seroma and fibrosis were more common with brachytherapy than with 3-dimensional CRT (50.4% vs 3.4% for seroma; P < .0001 and 66.3% vs 44.8% for fibrosis; P = .02), but grade 1 edema was more common with 3-dimensional CRT than with brachytherapy (17.2% vs 5.6%; P = .04). Grade 2 to 3 pain was more common with 3-dimensional CRT (17.2% vs 5.2%; P = .03). Actuarial 5-year rates of fair or poor radiation oncologist-reported cosmetic outcome were 9% for 3-dimensional CRT and 24% for brachytherapy (P = .13). Brachytherapy was significantly associated with inferior cosmesis on mixed model analysis (P = .003). Significant predictors of reduced risk of adverse cosmetic outcome after brachytherapy were D0.1cc (skin) <=102%, minimum skin distance >5.1 mm, dose homogeneity index >0.54, and volume of nonconformance <=0.89 cc. The 5-year ipsilateral breast recurrence was 4.3% for brachytherapy and 4.2% for 3-dimensional CRT APBI patients (P = .95).CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy APBI is associated with higher rates of grade 1 fibrosis and seroma than 3-dimensional CRT but lower rates of grade 1 edema and grade 2 to 3 pain than 3-dimensional CRT. Rates of radiation oncologist-reported fair or poor cosmetic outcomes are higher with brachytherapy. We identified dosimetric parameters that predict reduced risk of adverse cosmetic outcome after brachytherapy-based APBI. Ipsilateral breast recurrence was equivalent for brachytherapy and 3-dimensional CRT.",Excluded,0.84656215

BD-IX rats were implanted intracerebrally with an ethylnitrosourea-induced glioma. Three series of experiments were performed, with radiation given 14 days after inoculation of the glioma clone. In each series, the following radiation doses were given: 500 rads once, 1,000 rads once; and 1,000 rads twice, every time with or without two different doses of misonidazole. Radiation therapy significantly prolonged survival when compared to the longevity of the control group. The dose of 1,000 rads given twice was highly effective and the life-span of tumor-bearing rats increased from 72% to 121%.

523,"Patterns of recurrence after complete remission with definitive radiotherapy in the treatment of malignant glioma Background: In patients with malignant glioma, neuroimaging studies cannot identify the true tumor margins, and tumor disappearance on neuroimaging studies does not necessarily indicate histologic disappearance of the tumor. Method(s): Patterns of recurrence and survival times were studied retrospectively in 21 patients with glioblastoma and 16 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma, whose tumor had disappeared on neuroimaging studies after treatment. Result(s): Thirteen patients with glioblastoma and 8 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma developed a local recurrence alone. Four patients with glioblastoma developed both a local recurrence and seeding metastasis. Five patients with anaplastic astrocytoma were recurrence free. Overall 5- year survivals were 0% and 60% in patients with glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma, respectively. Conclusion(s): Long-term local control was not generally obtainable in glioblastoma; however, it was obtainable in anaplastic astrocytoma.",Excluded,0.83993894
1068,"CT perfusion study of vascular response to stereotactic radiosurgery in a preclinical model of glioma PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute changes in tumor and normal brain perfusion following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using computed tomography (CT) perfusion. METHOD(S): C6 glioma cells were implanted into the right caudate nuclei of five Wistar rats. Each rat was treated with 12 Gy of SRS using helical tomotherapy and underwent a CT perfusion scan on day 1 pre-SRS and day 5 post-SRS. Maps of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and permeability-surface area product (PS) were calculated from the CT perfusion studies. After rigid image registrations, the post-SRS CT perfusion maps were subtracted from the pre-SRS CT perfusion maps to produce CBF, CBV, and PS difference maps. Using Otsu's method, we categorized the voxels in the tumor and the peritumoral brain on the PS difference maps as regions of 1) substantial decrease, 2) modest change, and 3) substantial increase. Statistical differences in these regions and in the contralateral brain before and after SRS were tested using the paired t-test. RESULT(S): Using helical tomotherapy, 12 Gy of radiation could be delivered to the tumor, whereas the brainstem dose was < 4 Gy, and < 10% of the contralateral brain received >8 Gy. A significant decrease in PS was observed in voxels that were categorized as ""substantial decrease"" (p = 0.03), and these voxels corresponded to the tumor. We observed a marginally significant increase in PS and CBV (p = 0.07 and 0.08, respectively) in voxels of ""substantial increase,"" and these voxels corresponded to the peritumoral region. No perfusion difference (p > 0.05) was observed in the contralateral brain. CONCLUSION(S): Using CT perfusion, an acute differential vascular response to SRS was observed in the tumor and the peritumoral regions. This finding supports the contention that SRS effects may be mediated in part through the vascular effects of radiation.",Excluded,0.8380736
1128,"Metastatic location of extensive stage small-cell lung cancer: implications for thoracic radiation BACKGROUNDS: This study was designed to evaluate the role of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) in a selected patient population with oligometastatic extensive stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) without brain or liver involved. The underlying hypothesis was that TRT will improve outcomes in this favorable patient population.METHODS: 305 patients were included in an institutional review board (IRB)-approved study, of which 105 received TRT after chemotherapy (ChT) and 200 received ChT alone. The survival outcomes were compared between ChT+TRT group and ChT-alone group in patients with oligometastasis without brain or liver involved and patients with brain/liver/multimetastasis, respectively.RESULTS: The 1-year, 2-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) for all patients were 60.3%, 23.9% and 1.6%, respectively. The addition of TRT significantly improved PFS in total patients than ChT alone (14.5 months vs. 10.1 months, p = 0.006), but the OS benefit was not significant (17.8 months vs. 16.5 months, p = 0.061). For patients with oligometastasis (n = 118), TRT offered significant progression free survival (PFS) (16.5 months vs. 9.1 months, p = 0.005) and OS (19.2 months vs. 15.6 months, p = 0.039) benefits. However, for patients with brain/liver/multimetastasis, the PFS and OS were not improved with TRT (p = 0.49, p = 0.811).CONCLUSIONS: TRT provided significant PFS and OS benefits in patients with oligometastatic ES-SCLC without brain or liver involved. The consolidative TRT is a reasonable treatment option for this favorable patient population.",Excluded,0.8367961

1141,"Risk factors of brain metastases as initial failure for completely resected stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer Purpose/Objective(s): Brain metastasis (BM) is the main sign of failure of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). The lymph node (LN) status is a major determinant of outcome in patients with NSCLC, but whether or not the LN status is a major determinant of BM remains unclear. In the present study, we focused on completely resected staged IIIA (N2) LA-NSCLC to explore the correlation between LN status and BM. We also aimed to identify the risk factors of BM as the initial site of failure, as well as the potential highest-risk candidates who are most likely to benefit from prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Materials/Methods: The medical records of 357 consecutive patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC who underwent complete surgery were reviewed between January 2005 and June 2012. Time to BM as the initial site of failure was measured from the date of surgery to the date of BM in the patients who developed distant metastases or both local and distant recurrence as the initial failure, with BM defined as an event. The cumulative incidence of BM as the initial site of failure and survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. To assess the risk factors of BM, the log-rank test was used for univariate analysis, and Cox regression was used for multivariate analysis. Result(s): A total of 73 (20.4%) patients developed BM, and 60 patients had BM as their initial site of failure. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year risks for patients developing BM as the initial site of failure were 9.1%, 27.4%, and 35.4%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that non-squamous cell cancer (P = 0.000), positive extra-capsular extension of LN metastasis (P=0.041), number of metastatic LN > 4 (P = 0.018), multiple N2 stations (P = 0.027), and multiple regions of mediastinal LN (MLN) involvement (P = 0.010) were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing BM as the initial site of failure. Multivariate analysis showed that non-squamous cell cancer (P = 0.002; HR = 5.148; 95% CI = 1.863-14.222) and multiple regions of MLN involvement (P = 0.015; HR = 0.556; 95% CI = 0.326-0.948) were significantly associated with the high risk of BM as the initial site of failure. In patients with nonsquamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement, the fiveyear actuarial risk of BM as the initial failure was 47.6%. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated that non-squamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement were independent risk factors for BM as the initial failure in completely resected IIIA (N2) NSCLC. Patients with non-squamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement are at the highest risk of developing BM as the initial failure, and may receive a greater benefit from PCI. Prospective clinical trials are needed to verify the effect of PCI in the highest-risk subgroup we identified.",Excluded,0.8329529
914,"Identifying cognitive impairment in patients with primary malignant brain tumors (PBMT) INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment is one of the most disabling symptoms for individuals with PBMTs and has been identified as a major source of psychological distress by caregivers. Domain specific data regarding cognitive dysfunction following surgery is primarily from research conducted prior to the advent of current standards of care. The aims of this analysis were to identify specific domains of cognitive function most affected in the post-operative/treatment phases and to examine predictors of poor performance in those domains using a selected battery of neuropsychological tests. METHOD(S): Neuropsychological assessments were performed by trained examiners on patients (n=86) with a PMBT diagnosis that were recruited as part of a caregiver intervention trial (R01-NR013170). Domain-specific z-scores were created using published normative data for matching age groups and analyzed using Pearson's Chisquare and paired t-tests to evaluate univariate associations between age, gender, tumor location, type, grade and treatment status as potential predictors of cognitive impairment. RESULT(S): Participants were mostly male (59.2%), middle aged (mean 54.4, SD 15), with glioblastomas (55.4%) in the middle (40.8%) or frontal (35.4%) areas of the brain. The majority of participants had surgery (88.8%), chemo (62.3%), or radiation (65.6%) prior to assessment. Participant mean domain scores for Executive Function (z=-1.8), Verbal Memory (z=-1.5) and Aphasia (z=-0.8) fell below normative values indicating cognitive impairment. Age was significantly associated with impairment in Executive Function (p =.004) and Verbal Memory (p=.06). Further details of tumor type, location, and genetics will be discussed. CONCLUSION(S): This analysis shows that older patients with PMBTs are at particular risk for developing cognitive impairment in the specific areas of executive function and verbal memory. Clinicians should be aware of these risk factors, screen patients regularly for cognitive dysfunction in these areas and provide guidance to family caregivers on strategies to reduce the psychological distress associated with these impairments.",Excluded,0.8315134
572,"Neurocytoma: The cleveland clinic experience Objectives: Neurocytoma is an uncommon tumor and the need for postoperative therapy is controversial. We reviewed the Cleveland Clinic experience. Method(s): Patients with histologic diagnosis of neurocytoma between 1994 and 2011 were identified through an IRB-approved database. Clinical, tumor, and treatment factors were evaluated. Survival times were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Seventeen patients with neurocytoma were treated, age at diagnosis 16.8 - 66.8 years; (median 35.3 years). Thirteen patients were male, all were Caucasian. Most common presenting symptoms: headaches (n=12) and gait disturbance (n=3). Sixteen patients had intraventricular lesions. All patients underwent surgery (gross total resection, GTR: 5, subtotal resection, STR: 10). Three patients (2 with STR and 1 with a biopsy) underwent adjuvant radiation; 2 with fractionated RT and one with stereotactic radiosurgery. Median event free survival (EFS) was 6.3 years and the projected 10 year EFS was 23%. Overall survival (OS) was 92%. The degree of resection did not correlate with EFS. After median follow-up of 8.4 years, 5 patients are without evidence of disease, 4 of which had developed recurrent disease and subsequently underwent GTR. Patients treated with adjuvant radiation did not experience disease recurrence (n=3). Twelve patients had Ki-67 results available from diagnosis (median 1.3%,), 4 had Ki-67 results at recurrence which was invariably higher than at presentation (median 10.5%) Ki-67 was not predictive for EFS or OS. Conclusion(s): In this cohort of patients, median EFS was only 6.3 years, and suggested a possible benefit to adjuvant radiotherapy in select cases. The excellent OS of 94% suggests that these patients benefit from salvage therapy with a combination of surgery and radiation. Prospective and molecular analyses of these tumors may identify risk factors for disease recurrence and help determine who would benefit from more aggressive upfront therapy.",Excluded,0.8217382
98,"Treatment for older diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with cognitive impairment and dementia Background: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults, is often diagnosed between ages 60 and 70 years old. The population of older adults in the United States is projected to undergo rapid growth and increased life expectancy over the coming decades; thus, cancer cases among older adults will jointly be expected to increase. Comorbid conditions, such as cognitive impairment or dementia (CID), will also be more likely to be present at diagnosis of cancer in older adults and affect both treatment decision-making and prognosis. Few studies have evaluated treatment utilization patterns among older DLBCL patients with CID. Objective(s): Our objective was to describe treatment utilization patterns in older DLBCL patients with CID. Method(s): We performed a retrospective cohort study of 10 626 DLBCL patients ages 66 and older in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database, of whom 410 (3.9%) had CID prior to cancer diagnosis. Medicare beneficiaries with a first primary DLBCL diagnosis between 2001 and 2011 were identified. Validated algorithms utilizing administrative claims, diagnoses and procedures codes were used to identify CID and primary treatment with chemo-immunotherapy and radiation. The association between CID and receipt of treatment was determined using multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Result(s): Fewer patients with CID diagnoses received any DLBCL treatment (chemo-immunotherapy or radiation) compared with patients without CID (41% versus 65%). In multivariable models, patients with CID had significantly lower odds of any treatment (OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.38-0.59). These findings were consistent for treatment with chemo-immunotherapy (OR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.35-0.55) but not radiation (OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.59-1.06). In stratified analyses, patients aged 66-74 years (OR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.23-0.76) and Ann Arbor stage I-II (OR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.29-0.53) had the lowest odds of treatment. Conclusion(s): In summary, patients with CID were less likely to receive chemo-immunotherapy or radiation to treat DLBCL, and multiple factors could explain this less aggressive approach taken among these older patients. It remains unclear how CID and these differences in care influence survival. Further research on patient and caregiver preferences, treatment decision-making, and alternative treatment options for older patients with comorbid lymphoma and CID is warranted.",Excluded,0.8214891

Among them, 42 patients received chemotherapy while 18 patients did not receive after WBRT. With regard to anti-HER2 therapy, after WBRT, 17 patients received anti-HER2 treatment without prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy, 7 patients received anti-HER2 treatment with prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy, and 36 patients did not receive further anti-HER2 treatment. All patients were followed up regularly until January 23, 2013.RESULTS: The median OS of patients with BM was 12 months. Patients who received anti-HER2 therapy and chemotherapy after WBRT had significantly better survival compared with patients who did not receive further treatment. Patients who received anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT but did not receive adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy for early breast cancer had better OS, followed by patients who received anti-HER2 agent both in adjuvant treatment and after WBRT and patients who did not receive anti-HER2 treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that Karnofsky Performance Status, control of extracranial metastases, chemotherapy after WBRT, and anti-HER2 therapy combined with WBRT were all independent predictors for OS.CONCLUSION: Both chemotherapy and anti-HER2 therapy after WBRT could improve OS. Moreover, patients without prior exposure to adjuvant anti-HER2 treatment may have survival benefit superior to those of patients with prior exposure.",Excluded,0.81635463
235,"Dental therapy before and after radiotherapy--an evaluation on patients with head and neck malignancies The present investigation evaluates the dental care situation of patients with head and neck cancer before and after radiotherapy. The situations of these patients in 1993 and 2005 were compared to detect similarities, differences and developments. In the years 1993 and 2005, 37 and 36 patients, respectively, with head and neck cancer treated by the local departments of otorhinolaryngology and of radiotherapy were examined consecutively according to their aftercare appointments. Time points of radiotherapy treatment of the patients evaluated in 1993 varied from 1984 to 1993. The patients evaluated in 2005 had received radiotherapy between 1998 and 2005. Therefore the applied radiotherapeutic regimen differed not only between the two groups of patients, but also within each group. The information for these investigations was provided anonymously. It was evaluated with descriptive statistics. The evaluation of the data shows distinct differences with respect to preventive and therapeutic dental care measures. In 2005, 35 out of 36 patients (97.2%) had a dental consultation before radiotherapy (1993, 65%). All 27 dentate patients (100%) obtained a splint for fluoride application (1993, none). 29% fewer edentulous patients were seen than in 1993. The number of teeth destroyed decreased from 19.2% (1993) to 7.8% in 2005. Mycoses due to Candida spp. and chronic failures in wound healing were rare (5.5%). In the course of the 12 years, prophylactic measures, such as the application of splints for fluoride treatment, were intensified. However, concepts for the dental care of patients undergoing radiotherapy, especially following the radiation, should be widened to avoid ruined teeth and long delayed wound healings.",Excluded,0.8111814
159,"Health-Related Quality of Life in large recurrence Glioblastoma treated with protontherapy Purpose or Objective: Protontherapy (PT) could minimize the risk of side effects compared to conventional photon therapy and therefore reduce the possible detrimental effect on QoL of reirradiation. We report the effect of re-irradiation with active scanning PT of large recurrence GBM in terms of quality of life scored by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)--C30 and EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Brain Cancer Module (QLQ-BN20). Material(s) and Method(s): Between January 2015 and October 2018 thirty patients with recurrence GBM were re-irradiated with active scanning PT. All patients had been previously treated with photon radiotherapy (60 Gy) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ). Median age and Karnofsky performance status at re-irradiation were 53 years (range, 30-68 years) and 80%, (range, 60-100%), respectively. Target definition was based on CT, MR, and 18F-DOPA PET imaging. Median CTV (clinical target volume) was 69 cc (range, 11-259 cc). All patients received 36 GyRBE (RBE: relative biologic effectiveness) in 18 fractions, with concomitant TMZ in 7 patients (25%). Subscales within the EORTC QLQ-C30 include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), three symptoms scales (nausea, vomiting, and fatigue), six single-item scales (insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, dyspnea, and financial effect of tumor/treatment) and global QoL. The BN20 is specifically developed for brain patients and assessed visual disorders, motor function, communication deficit, various disease symptoms, treatment, toxicity and future uncertainty. The patients completed the EORTC questionnaires before starting PT, the day of the end of PT and every follow-up consult (1-month, 3-months) until progression of disease. Result(s): The treatment was associated with stability in most of the preselected HRQOL domains. Global health improved over time with a maximum difference of 6 points between baseline and 3-months follow-up. Social functioning and motor dysfunction improved over time with a maximum difference of 8 and 2 points, respectively. We showed only a small not significance decrease in cognitive and emotional functioning. Interestingly, fatigue remained stable during the analysis such as the other preselected domains. Increase of CTV, use of steroids before protontherapy and concomitant chemotherapy are associated with a statistically significantworse QLQ C30_Social, QLQ C30_Physical and BN20_Motor values. Conclusion(s): Re-irradiation with PT for a large recurrence Glioblastoma is a safe treatment without a negative effect on HRQOL until the time of disease progression.

The limited literature consists of case reports and small case series, with the largest including 25 patients. We performed a population-based study to describe disease course, treatment, and survival in women with NECE compared to endometrioid endometrial cancer (EC). Method(s): The National Cancer Data Base was used to identify women with NECE and women with poorly differentiated EC from 2004 to 2015. The cohort was limited to women with histologic confirmation and who received hysterectomy without neoadjuvant therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were developed to compare survival between groups using a log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard regression models were fit to analyze associations between survival and histology while adjusting for clinical and demographic differences. Result(s): A total of 28,291 women with EC and 364 women with NECE were identified. More women with neuroendocrine tumors were non-white and presented with later stage disease (P < 0.05 for both). Stage III-IV tumors were diagnosed in 56% of women with NECE versus 26% of women with EC (P < 0.001). Women with NECE were more likely to receive chemotherapy (60% vs 30%, P < 0.001), but were less likely to receive radiation (28% vs 48%, P < 0.001). In a multivariable model, women with NECE were more than twice as likely to die than those with EC tumors (HR = 2.29, 95% CI 1.85-2.84). Similar trends were noted in analyses limited to stage I (HR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.02-2.57) and stage III (HR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.91-3.61) neoplasms. In a Kaplan-Meier analysis, median survival was 17 months (95% CI 12-23) for women with NECE and 144 months (95% CI 140-148) for those with EC (P < 0.001). Five-year survival was 38% (95% CI 32.7-43.8%) in those with NECE vs 69% (95% CI 68.2-69.4%) in those with EC (P < 0.001). See Figure 1. Conclusion(s): Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the endometrium is a rare uterine carcinoma. Compared to patients with poorly differentiated EC, patients with NECE present with later stage disease and have decreased survival. [Figure presented] Copyright Â© 2019",Excluded,0.79668003
1056,"Radiotherapy of the neck and carotid stenosis The first choice of treatment for neck cancer is often radiotherapy. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the microinflammation after radiotherapy of the neck and the incidence of carotid stenosis. This study reports on patients treated with radiotherapy as part of the treatment for laryngeal cancer in the Department of Radiation Oncology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, P.R. China. Sixty-two males and nine females were treated with radiotherapy between 2006 and 3012. The carotid diameter was determined by measuring carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in the common, external and internal carotid artery. Microinflammatory conditions were assessed by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Other studied risk factors included age, treatment modalities, radiation dose and energy, the height of the radiation field, and follow-up time. Carotid stenosis was detected in all of the 71 patients. It was mainly clinically unsuspected; 19 patients had sustained a vascular event (14 TIA, 5 CVI) at a median of 3.11 years (range 2.3-5.6 years) following RT. In four of five CVI patients, CVI occurred on the side of the irradiation. Eleven patients who suffered vascular incident had severe stenosis of the carotid artery and 6 had moderate (31-49% of the lumen). Only two patients with mild stenosis on the irradiated side suffered TIAs. Serum hs-CRP levels in carotid stenosis were 9.4 (+/-SD=5.97) mg/ml, IL-6 = 12.8 (+/-SD=2.62) pg/ml and TNF-alpha = 15.4 (+/-SD=4.49) ng/ml.

Indolent leg weakness occurred early in radiation disease, whereas pain marked the onset of tumor plexopathy. Eventually, all radiation cases had weakness, which was bilateral in most of them and painless in one-half of them. Tumor patients typically had unilateral weakness, which was painful in all of them. Radiation disease often resulted in serious neurologic disability. Of the tumor patients, 86% were dead within 3 1/2 years after onset of neurologic symptoms.",Excluded,0.77555853
451,"Irradiation induced clonogenic cell death of human malignant glioma cells does not require CD95/CD95L interactions BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is the single most effective therapy for malignant gliomas. Targeting the CD95 apoptotic pathway is a promising experimental approach to these neoplasms. Here, we asked whether irradiation modulates CD95-mediated apoptosis of human malignant glioma cells in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODS: LN-18, LN-229 and T98G human malignant glioma cell lines were irradiated with dosages from 0-8 Gy and treated with CD95L (CD95 ligand). CD95 expression was assessed by flow cytometry. Caspase activity was determined by DEVD cleavage. Cytotoxic effects were assessed by crystal violet staining of cells in a 96-well plate assay. Clonogenic cell death was determined by a standard colony forming assay.RESULTS: We find that (i) CD95L-induced apoptosis, but not irradiation-induced clonogenic cell death, involves caspase 3 activation and is blocked by the viral caspase inhibitor, crm-A. (ii) Irradiation does not modulate CD95 expression either in p53 wild-type or in p53 mutant glioma cell lines, and does not enhance CD95L-evoked caspase 3 activity or CD95L-induced clonogenic cell death.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that endogenous CD95/CD95L interactions are not involved in radiation-induced clonogenic cell death and that the killing cascades of CD95L and irradiation are independent in human malignant glioma cells.",Excluded,0.76900315

Method(s): The trypan blue was used to examine cell viability before and after treatment, and real time PCR to analyze the expression of microRNAs in time 0h (immediately after treatments), and 48h after the exposure to treatments. Result(s): The analysis of cell viability showed no statistically significant difference among the studied groups. The oncogene miR-21 demonstrated a significantly higher expression in neurospheres in group treated with ionizing radiation (both 0h and 48h). The tumor suppressors microRNAs miR-15 and miR-16 had no significant expression among cell types and treatments modalities submissions. However, miR-15 and miR-16 had a considerably different expression between the analyzed periods: miR-15 in the time 0h was highly expressed in adherent cells treated with ionizing radiation and temozolomide; and, during the 48 hour analysis, miR-15 was more expressed in neurospheres with the same type of treatment. The same expression profile happened with the miR-16, however being more expressed in the group treated with ionizing radiation. Conclusion(s): MicroRNAs studied in glioblastoma cell line culture demonstrated differentially expressions when compared neurospheres and adhered cells and different treatments. MiR-21 expression was significantly different between cell types (neurospheres and adhered cells), remaining more expressed in neurospheres treated with ionizing radiation.",Excluded,0.7442395

Patients were assessed immediately prior to treatment, and again within a week of finishing. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the Bidimensional Fatigue Scale (BFS). Quality of life was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQc30). Psychological distress was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Personality Traits were assessed using the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI). Fatigue severity increased significantly on 3 out of the 5 assessment instruments used. Radiotherapy was associated with a decline in global quality of life, role, cognitive and social functioning, and an increase in nausea/vomiting, pain, insomnia, diarrhea, and financial difficulty. At baseline, 39% of the variation in fatigue scores among the patients could be explained by a combination of measures of their global quality of life and physical functioning. A combination of fatigue and anxiety scores at baseline was able to predict 54% of the variation in fatigue scores at the completion of radiotherapy. These data indicate that fatigue is a significant problem for patients receiving radical radiotherapy, although its severity is relatively modest.",Excluded,0.7342927
689,"Patterns of failure after multimodal treatments for high-grade glioma: effectiveness of MIB-1 labeling index Background: The purpose of the present study was to analyze the recurrence pattern of high-grade glioma treated with a multimodal treatment approach and to evaluate whether the MIB-1 labeling index (LI) could be a useful marker for predicting the pattern of failure in glioblastoma (GB).Methods and materials: We evaluated histologically confirmed 131 patients with either anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or GB. A median dose was 60 Gy. Concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy were administered to 111 patients. MIB-1 LI was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Recurrence patterns were categorized according to the areas of recurrence as follows: central failure (recurrence in the 95% of 60 Gy); in-field (recurrence in the high-dose volume of 50 Gy; marginal (recurrence outside the high-dose volume) and distant (recurrence outside the RT field). Result(s): The median follow-up durations were 13 months for all patients and 19 months for those remaining alive. Among AA patients, the 2-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 23.1% and 39.2%, respectively, while in GB patients, the rates were 13.3% and 27.6%, respectively. The median survival time was 20 months for AA patients and 15 months for GB patients. Among AA patients, recurrences were central in 68.7% of patients; in-field, 18.8%; and distant, 12.5%, while among GB patients, 69.0% of recurrences were central, 15.5% were in-field, 12.1% were marginal, and 3.4% were distant. The MIB-1 LI medians were 18.2% in AA and 29.8% in GB. Interestingly, in patients with GB, the MIB-1 LI had a strong effect on the pattern of failure (P = 0.014), while the extent of surgical removal (P = 0.47) and regimens of chemotherapy (P = 0.57) did not. Conclusion(s): MIB-1 LI predominantly affected the pattern of failure in GB patients treated with a multimodal approach, and it might be a useful tool for the management of the disease.

The radiation response was evaluated in terms of regrowth delay; estimates of in situ cell survival were made by back-extrapolation of regrowth curves. These studies showed no significant difference in the effectiveness of single as compared to split dose irradiation i.e. no sparing effect of fractionation.

There is little information, however, about the direct effect of night work on the risk of cancer. We investigated the effect of night work in breast cancer.METHODS: We examined the relationship between breast cancer and working on rotating night shifts during 10 years of follow-up in 78 562 women from the Nurses' Health Study. Information was ascertained in 1988 about the total number of years during which the nurses had worked rotating night shifts with at least three nights per month. From June 1988 through May 1998, we documented 2441 incident breast cancer cases. Logistic regression models were used to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for confounding variables and breast cancer risk factors. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: We observed a moderate increase in breast cancer risk among the women who worked 1-14 years or 15-29 years on rotating night shifts (multivariate adjusted RR = 1.08 [95% CI = 0.99 to 1.18] and RR = 1.08 [95% CI = 0.90 to 1.30], respectively). The risk was further increased among women who worked 30 or more years on the night shift (RR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.78). The test for trend was statistically significant (P =.02).CONCLUSIONS: Women who work on rotating night shifts with at least three nights per month, in addition to days and evenings in that month, appear to have a moderately increased risk of breast cancer after extended periods of working rotating night shifts.",Excluded,0.7131446
956,"The effect of biological effective dose on time to symptom progression in metastatic renal cell carcinoma AIMS: Renal cell carcinoma is commonly thought to be a radioresistant malignancy. Retrospective studies report conflicting results on the effect of radiotherapy dose escalation on response and time to progression in symptomatic metastatic disease; studies using the linear quadratic model have used alpha/beta ratios that are inappropriate for slow growing tumours. We aim to describe our experience with palliative radiotherapy in this context, relating Biological Effective Dose to outcome.MATERIALS AND METHODS: From December 1995 to April 2001, 143 independent palliative radiotherapy treatments were delivered to 78 patients in a single institution. Retrospective data was obtained on the radiotherapy schedule used, symptom response and time to symptom progression. The biological effective dose (BED) was calculated using alpha/beta ratios of 3 and 7 Gy (BED3 and BED7). The Log-Rank test was used to assess any differences in time to progression, and the Cox Proportional Hazards analysis to determine prognostic factors of time to progression.RESULTS: Overall symptomatic response rate was 73%, with most responses being partial (67%). Forty-three (38%) patients had symptomatic progression after a median follow-up of 425 days. BED (BED3 or BED7) was not significantly different across response types (complete, partial or no response; P=0.90 and 0.88, respectively) and was not predictive for time to symptomatic progression (P=0.99 for BED3 and P=0.70 for BED7). Patients with bone metastases received less total dose (P=0.001), less BED (BED3, P=0.0013, and BED7, P=0.0005) and had a significantly longer time to progression than other sites of metastases (hazard ratio (HR) 0.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.7; P=0.004). Initial treatment with interferon-alpha alone in patients presenting with metastatic disease, before palliative radiotherapy, was also associated with a shorter time to symptom progression (HR 4.6; 95% CI 1.5-14.1; P=0.007). On removal of these criteria, brain metastases became a significant predictor of progression time, with an HR of 2.5 (95% CI 1.0-5.9; P=0.05), showing an increased risk of progression with brain metastases compared with metastases elsewhere. Time from primary diagnosis to development of metastatic disease was not predictive of time to symptom progression (P=0.29).CONCLUSION: Despite the widespread assumption that renal cell carcinoma is radioresistant, retrospective assessment showed high response rates to palliative radiotherapy. On the basis of our data, higher BED does not seem to be a predictor of response or of duration of response in the palliative treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Palliation of bone pain seems to be particularly durable compared with the palliation of symptoms at other sites of metastases. A trend for shorter duration of palliative effect of whole-brain radiotherapy was noted.",Excluded,0.7108449
1103,"Clinical and prognostic features of adult patients with gangliogliomas Background: Gangliogliomas (GG) represent less than 1% of primary brain tumors in adults. Little is known regarding prognostic features, clinical characteristics or the impact of treatment on patient (pt) outcomes. Method(s): In this IRB approved retrospective study, our neuro-oncology longitudinal database was screened for pts with GG from 1992-2012. 67 adult pts (age>18) were identified. Result(s): 60 pts presented with low grade GG and 7 with anaplastic GG. The median age at diagnosis was 27 years (18-59). 22 pts developed recurrent disease (18 low grade and 4 high grade) with a median time to recurrence of 87 weeks from surgery. 7 of the pts with low grade GG had malignant transformation to a malignant tumor (anaplastic GG or GBM). 22 pts received radiation therapy, 16 at diagnosis. 14 pts received chemotherapy at recurrence. Pts with incomplete resections or higher grade tumors were more likely to receive chemotherapy or radiation. The median overall survival (OS) time for these pts was not reached with a median follow-up time of 4.6 years. The 2-, 5- and 10-year OS were 98%, 87%, and 76%. Factors on univariate analysis that were significantly associated with OS were KPS at presentation (HR 10.1; 95% CI 2.6, 39.1; p = 0.0008), extent of resection (EOR) (biopsy vs gross total; HR 12.1; 95% CI 2.3, 63.6; p = 0.003), histologic grade (Grade 1-2 vs Grade 3-4; HR 0.06; 95% CI 0.01, 0.3; p = 0.0002), and seizure control following surgery (Engel I vs Engel 2-3; HR 0.1; 95% CI 0.01, 0.9; p = 0.02). Factors on univariate analysis that were significantly associated with progression free survival (PFS) were EOR (biopsy vs gross total; HR 4.0; 95% CI 1.4, 11.9; p = 0.01) and histologic grade (Grade 1-2 vs .Grade 3-4; HR 0.3; 95% CI 0.08, 0.8; p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis, EOR is most significant for PFS (p = 0.01), while tumor grade is most significant for OS (p = 0.004).

267,"Concurrent temozolomide and radiation in elderly patients with glioblastoma: A retrospective analysis Purpose/Objective(s): Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Radiation with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide is well tolerated and significantly improves survival. In studying this treatment approach, patients >=70 years of age have rarely been included. Here we examine the potential benefit of concurrent temozolomide in patients >=70. Materials/Methods: Retrospective chart review of patient records treated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) between January 1, 2004 and January 1, 2010, with radiation (XRT) for GBM with or without temozolomide. Analysis was limited to patients >= 70 years of age with GBM, who received XRT at MDACC, had no previous chemotherapy or XRT for their diagnosis, and had no prior grade 1-3 glioma diagnosis. Of 170 patients >=70 years old at the time of histopathologic diagnosis of GBM by either biopsy or resection, 51 met these criteria, (median age 75, range 70- 87). Extent of tumor resection was evaluated by surgical reports and immediate postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval between initial GBM diagnosis to death or last follow-up. Progression free survival (PFS) was calculated as interval between diagnosis and documented progression or death. Overall median follow up was 7 months (0-43), with median of 4 months (0-31) in the XRT only group, and 10 months (1-43) in the XRT + temozolomide group. Survival differences were calculated via the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log rank statistics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using Cox-regression analysis. This study was reviewed and approved by the MDACC Internal Review Board. Result(s): On univariate analysis, the following variables were significantly associated with overall survival: Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) (<80 vs >= 80 p = 0.039), radiation dose (<= 50 Gy vs > 50 Gy, p = 0.013), concurrent temozolomide (p = 0.006) and extent of surgery (biopsy vs subtotal resection vs gross total resection, p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis, extent of surgery, concurrent temozolamide and XRT dose were associated with improved OS (p=0.003). Median OS for the population was 8 months (<1-43). OS in those patients treated with XRT alone was 5 months vs 11 months in those patients receiving XRT and temozolomide (p =0.004). Median progression free survival was 5 months (<1-28) with no significant difference (p =0.164) between treatment groups. Conclusion(s):With short follow up, temozolomide in addition to radiation therapy is associated with improved overall survival in patients withGBM>=70 years. This prompts further prospective study to evaluate the effects of age, health status and fractionation on survival and quality of life in the elderly patient with GBM.",Excluded,0.6945298

However, there have been no studies regarding the effects of radon inhalation on neuropathic pain. In this study, we aimed to determine whether radon inhalation actually induced a remission of neuropathic pain and improved the quality of life.METHODS: First, we investigated the antinociceptive effects of radon inhalation in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain. We evaluated pain behaviour in mice before and after CCI surgery, using von Frey test. Pretreated mice received CCI surgery immediately after 24-h inhalation of radon at background (BG) concentration (c. 19 Bq/m(3) ), or at a concentration of 1000 or 2000 Bq/m(3) , and post-treated mice inhaled similar levels of radon 2 days after CCI surgery.RESULTS: CCI surgery induced mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia on a plantar surface of mice, as assessed using von Frey test, and 2000 Bq/m(3) radon inhalation alleviated hyperalgesic conditions 22-37% compared to BG level concentration. Concurrently, CCI surgery increased norepinephrine (NE), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations in plasma, and leukocyte migration in paws. Furthermore, CCI-induced neuropathy reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Treatment with radon inhalation, specifically at a concentration of 2000 Bq/m(3) , produced antinociceptive effects, i.e., lowered plasma TNF-alpha, NE and NO levels and restored SOD activity, as well as pain-related behaviour.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that inhalation of 2000 Bq/m(3) radon prevented and alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain in mice.",Excluded,0.6825279

Experience of the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute] OBJECTIVE: Despite the achievements of recent years, cerebral AVMs continue to pose a challenge to treatment. The objective of this work was the development of recommendations for combined treatment of AVMs based on analysis of the available material and published data.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 93 patients hospitalized at the Neurosurgical Institute for combined treatment of cerebral AVMs in 2010-2014. A group of combined surgery (removal of an AVM with preoperative embolization) consisted of 40 patients, and a group of combined radiotherapy (radiation after partial embolization or partial removal of an AVM) included 53 patients. 36 patients underwent radiosurgery, and 17 patients received stereotactic radiation therapy. Both groups were analyzed in terms of outcomes, complications, and follow-up results.RESULTS: In the group of combined surgery, according to the Glasgow outcome scale, good results (grade 4-5) were achieved in 35 (87.5%) patients at discharge and in 27 (90%) patients during follow-up. Treatment outcomes, surgery duration, and the amount of blood loss were not significantly different from those in the control group.

Radiation-related white matter toxicity is detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and has been correlated with neurocognitive dysfunction. This study assessed the risk of developing white matter changes (WMC) in breast cancer patients who underwent either WBRT plus stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or SRS alone. We retrospectively compared 35 patients with breast cancer brain metastases who received WBRT and SRS to 30 patients who only received SRS. All patients had evaluable imaging at a median of one year after their initial management. The development of white matter T2 prolongation as detected by T2 or FLAIR imaging was graded: grade 1 = little or no white matter T2 hyperintensity; grade 2 = limited periventricular hyperintensity; and grade 3 = diffuse white matter hyperintensity. After WBRT plus SRS, patients demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of WMC (p < 0.0001). After one year, 71.5 % of patients whose treatment included WBRT demonstrated WMC (42.9 % grade 2; 28.6 % grade 3). Only one patient receiving only SRS developed WMC. In long-term survivors of breast cancer, the risk of WMC was significantly reduced when SRS alone was used for management. Further prospective studies are necessary to determine how these findings correlate with neurocognitive toxicity. WBRT usage as initial management of limited brain disease should be replaced by SRS alone to reduce the risk of delayed white matter toxicity.",Excluded,0.66347116

Of those, 23 were located on the skull base, were large or had complex shapes, and were treated with radical intent. Both stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT, 16 or more fractions) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT, 3 fractions) were used. Eighteen patients underwent proton HSRT, while 5 patients were treated with SRT. The mean target volume for the HSRT group was 15.6 cm(3) (range 2.6-63 cm(3)). The mean ICRU reference dose was 20.3 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGyE), and the mean minimum planning target dose was 16.3 CGyE. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up periods were 40 and 31 months respectively. The mean volume in the SRT group was 43.7 cm(3), with ICRU reference doses ranging from 54 CGyE in 27 fractions to 61.6 CGyE in 16 fractions.RESULTS: In the HSRT group, 16/18 (89%) of patients remained clinically stable or improved, while 2/18 (11%) deteriorated. Radiologic control was achieved in 88% of patients, while 2 patients had a marginal failure. Among the 5 SRT patients, 2 were clinically better, and 3 remained stable.

The absorbed doses of gamma-radiation were measured with a mixed radiation dosimeter.Results: The viability of boron-containing and intact human U251 and T98G cell lines and Chinese hamster CHO-K1 and V-79 cells was analyzed after neutron beam radiation. Irradiation of all four cell lines were cultured in the presence of 10B was shown to reduce their colony-forming capacity compared with the control. Elevated boron levels in the culture medium resulted in a significant decrease in the proportion of survived cells. Radiation had the most pronounced impact on the proliferative capacity of the human U251 glioma cell lines.Conclusion: The cultures of human tumor cells and mammalian cells demonstrated that the neutron beam formed with the accelerator-based epithermal neutron source designed at the INP, was effective in reducing the viability of tumor cells in the presence of 10B.",Excluded,0.64058816
893,"Long-Term outcomes of 107 cases of primary thyroid mucosa-Associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma at a single medical institution in Japan Context: Thyroid mucosa-Associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is a type of extranodal lymphoma with a favorable prognosis. Objective(s): To provide information on long-Term outcomes that would facilitate establishment of the optimal management strategy for thyroid lymphoma. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): Medical records of 107 patients (median age 67 years, 20 males, 87 females) who were diagnosed with localized thyroid MALT lymphoma stage IE or IIE at Ito Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Main Outcome Measure(s): Overall and event-free survival (EFS). Result(s): Initial treatments included radiation therapy (RT) alone (n = 58), combined modality therapy (CMT) (n = 48), or chemotherapy alone (n = 1). All 107 patients responded to the treatment, six of whom experienced relapse. Only one patient died of lymphoma. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and EFS rates were 94% [95% confidence interval (CI), 87% to 97%] and 92% (95% CI, 85% to 95%), respectively, and the 10-year OS and EFS rates were 91% (95% CI, 83% to 95%) and 84% (95% CI, 74% to 90%), respectively. Of the 106 patients with information available on adverse events, 71 patients (67%) developed hypothyroidism after primary thyroid lymphoma treatment. The CMT group showed additional chemotherapy-induced adverse reactions in the form of neutropenia, neuropathy, constipation, and pneumonia. The 5-year OS rates of patients treated with CMT and RT were 93% (95% CI, 81% to 98%) and 94% (95% CI, 84% to 98%), respectively. Conclusion(s): Long-Term outcomes of localized thyroid MALT lymphoma are favorable with all initial treatment modalities. Copyright Â© 2018 Endocrine Society.",Excluded,0.62034565
1063,"Dose-dependent effects of small-vessel disease MRI markers on regional cortical thinning and structural connectivity Background: MRI markers of cerebral small vessel disease including white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, and microbleeds are related to cognitive dysfunction in subjects with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Previous studies have usually focused on the location of these vascular markers and did not consider the concomitant effect by Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. In this study, we aimed to find dose-dependent effects of these MRI markers on regional cortical thinning and white matter tract damage in VCI patients, considering the effect by concomitant AD pathology. Method(s): Participants consisted of 65 patients with mild cognitive impairment associated with small-vessel disease (svMCI) and 69 with subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD). Conventional brain MRI scans, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and PIB PET were performed. WMH, lacunes, microbleeds, and PIB retention amount were measured. Multiple regression analyses were used to elucidate the relationship between regional cortical thickness, DTI abnormalities, and each small vessel vascular marker, adjusting the effects by demographic factors and PIB retention amount. Result(s): Higher WMH volume was associated with cortical thinning in bilateral cingulate cortices, right insular cortex, and left lingual gyrus. More lacunes were associated with cortical thinning in the right medial and superior frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. Microbleeds were not related with regional cortical thinning. Higher PIB retention was associated with cortical thinning in left medial temporal lobe. Independent of other vascular markers and PIB retention amount, larger WMH volume was associated with decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in widespread periventricular white matter region. Regardless of PIB retention amount, more lacunes were associated with decreased FA in bilateral posterior and anterior corona radiata, right anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral posterior limb of internal capsule, and bilateral precuneus. Microbleeds had association with decreased FA in the bilateral posterior corona radiata and optic radiation. PIB retention amount was not related with regional FA decrease. The association between neuropsychological scores and vascularmarkers were generally compatible with findings from cortical thickness and DTI analyses. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that small vessel vascular markers in VCI patients are related with regional cortical thinning and white matter abnormalities in a dosedependent manner regardless of AD pathology.",Excluded,0.6181907
933,"Saturation of DNA repair measured by alkaline elution To determine whether the half-times (T1/2) of the DNA repair processes measured by alkaline elution increased in a dose-dependent manner, exponentially growing 9L/Ro rat brain tumor cells were irradiated with doses of 15-50 Gy, and their DNA repair kinetics was measured by alkaline elution. At 15 Gy, the DNA repair kinetics was biphasic with the fast phase having a T1/2 approximately 6 min and the slow phase having a T1/2 approximately 42 min. As the dose was increased to 50 Gy, the fast-phase T1/2 remained at approximately 6 min, but the slow-phase T1/2 increased to approximately 87 min. Although a dose-dependent increase in the T1/2 of the slow phase of DNA repair (saturation) was measured by alkaline elution, both the absolute value of the slow-phase T1/2 and the dependency of the slow-phase T1/2 on dose were less than those measured by alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation in zonal rotors with slow reorienting gradient capability. Thus these two techniques appear either to depend on different hydrodynamic properties of the DNA or to have different coefficients of dependency for the same hydrodynamic properties of the DNA. The lower sensitivity for detection of the dose dependency of DNA repair makes it unlikely that the alkaline elution technique will be useful for quantitatively relating the shape of mammalian cell survival curves to the doses at which saturation of a DNA repair process occurs.",Excluded,0.60922784
1021,"Control of brain metastases from radioresistant tumors treated by stereotactic radiosurgery Renal cell carcinoma, sarcoma, and melanoma are considered to be ""radioresistant"" tumor histologies. Brain metastases (BM) from these tumors are considered unlikely to be controlled using the relatively low doses used in whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Our objective was to analyze the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on local control and overall survival of BM from radioresistant primary tumors. We reviewed all patients who received Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) for BM at Columbia University Medical Center between January 2009 and April 2014. All patients were treated using the Gamma Knife Perfexion System. Dosimetric data was collected from treatment plans and metastases were categorized as radioresistant or not. Response was assessed by reviewing follow-up brain imaging studies and classified according to RECIST. Local control and median overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. In total, 373 tumors were analyzed from 126 patients. Of these tumors, 49 (13.1 %) originated from radioresistant cancers. The overall local control rate in the radioresistant cohort was 89.8 and 90.1 % in the non-radioresistant cohort. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that radioresistance status of the primary tumor had no statistically significant effect on local control with hazard ratios of 1.0 (p = 1.0, 95 % CI 0.388-2.576) and 0.954 (p = 0.926, 95 % CI 0.349-2.603) respectively. Median overall survival for both radioresistant and non-radioresistant cohorts was 20.0 months, with a p value of 0.926. There was no significant difference in local control of BM from radioresistant and non-radioresistant primary tumors treated with GKRS. Both cohorts showed excellent response and local control, suggesting that SRS upfront or in addition to WBRT may be an appropriate strategy in the treatment of BM from radioresistant cancers. Median overall survival for both cohorts was equal, suggesting that improved local control may be associated with an improvement in long-term survival.",Excluded,0.6044069

1100,"TGFbeta1 Polymorphisms Predict Distant Metastasis-Free Survival in Patients with Inoperable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer after Definitive Radiotherapy Purpose:Transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta1 signaling is involved in cancer-cell metastasis. We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at TGFbeta1 were associated with overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy. Method(s):We genotyped TGFbeta1 SNPs at rs1800469 (C-509T), rs1800471 (G915C), and rs1982073 (T+29C) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in blood samples from 205 NSCLC patients who had had definitive radiotherapy at one institution in November 1998-January 2005. We also tested whether the TGF-beta1 rs1982073 (T+29C) SNP affected the migration and invasion of A549 and PC9 lung cancer cells. Result(s):Median follow-up time for all patients was 17 months (range, 1-97 months; 39 months for patients alive at the time of analysis). Multivariate analysis showed that the TGFbeta1 rs1800469 CT/CC genotype was associated with poor OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.463 [95% confidence interval {CI} = 1.012-2.114], P = 0.043) and shorter DMFS (HR = 1.601 [95% CI = 1.042-2.459], P = 0.032) and that the TGFbeta1 rs1982073 CT/CC genotype predicted poor DMFS (HR = 1.589 [95% CI = 1.009-2.502], P = 0.046) and poor brain MFS (HR = 2.567 [95% CI = 1.155-5.702], P = 0.021) after adjustment for age, sex, race, performance status, smoking status, tumor histology and volume, stage, receipt of concurrent radiochemotherapy, number of chemotherapy cycles, and radiation dose. Transfection with TGFbeta1+29C (vs. +29T) stimulated the migration and invasion of A549 and PC9 cells, suggesting that TGFbeta1+29C may be linked with increased metastatic potential. Conclusion(s):TGFbeta1 genotypes at rs1800469 and rs1982073 could be useful for predicting DMFS among patients with NSCLC treated with definitive radiation therapy. These findings require validation in larger prospective trials and thorough mechanistic studies. Â© 2013 Yuan et al.",Excluded,0.58954924
556,"Determination of the sizes of the opioid receptors in their membrane environment by radiation inactivation Opioids, like other drugs, are thought to initiate their effects by association with their specific receptors. However, very little is known about the opioid receptor as a molecular entity. The binding components have been solubilized in detergent and purified by different approaches, but the molecular size of soluble opioid receptor complexes reported by different groups varied from 23,000 to 750,000. In this study, the technique of radiation inactivation by gamma rays was used to investigate the apparent size of the opioid receptor in rat brain membranes under different conditions. The molecular sizes of opioid receptor complexes were estimated as 313,000 +/- 13,500 in the presence of [D-Ala2, D-Leu5] enkephalin, NaCl and Gpp (NH)p; as 165,000 +/- 8,500 in the presence of NaCl only, or of both NaCl and Gpp (NH)p; as 217,000 +/- 6,600 in the presence of Gpp (NH)p only; and as 286,000 +/- 60,900 in the presence of MgCl2 only.

577,"Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma.METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival.RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD.CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume.",Excluded,0.5742687
899,"M.I.T./Canadian vestibular experiments on the Spacelab-1 mission: 3. Effects of prolonged weightlessness on a human otolith-spinal reflex Reflex responses that depend on human otolith organ sensitivity were measured before, during and after a 10 day space flight. Otolith-spinal reflexes were elicited by means of sudden, unexpected falls. In weightlessness, ""falls"" were achieved using elastic cords running from a torso harness to the floor. Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from gastrocnemius-soleus. The EMG response occurring in the first 100-120 ms of a fall, considered to be predominantly otolith-spinal in origin, decreased in amplitude immediately upon entering weightlessness, and continued to decline throughout the flight, especially during the first two mission days. The response returned to normal before the first post-flight testing session. The results suggest that information coming from the otolith organs is gradually ignored by the nervous system during prolonged space flight, although the possibility that otolith-spinal reflexes are decreased independent of other otolith output pathways cannot be ruled out.",Excluded,0.5736795

Methods A retrospective review of a prospective database of patients with clinical PNI from cutaneous SCC of the head and neck (SCCHN) treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) between 2000 and 2011 and a minimum of 24 months follow-up. Patients were excluded if immunosuppressed, had non-SCC histology, or were treated palliatively. Results Fifty patients (mean age, 60 years) with median follow-up of 50 months were included in this study. A total of 54.8% of known primary tumors had incidental PNI. Ten percent had nodal disease at presentation. MRI neurogram was positive in 95.8%. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 5-years was 62%. Five-year disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) were 75% and 64%, respectively. There were no perioperative deaths. Conclusion This report demonstrates that long-term survival is achievable in patients with clinical PNI from cutaneous SCCHN after surgery and PORT.

1161,"P76.82 Osimertinib versus First-Generation EGFR-TKIs in Untreated EGFR-Mutant NSCLC with Brain Metastasis: 362 Real-World Cases Introduction: Osimertinib showed superior efficacy to first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) among untreated advanced EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the phase III FLAURA study. However, relevant real-world data in patients with baseline brain metastasis (BM) as well as the clinical value of upfront cranial local therapy (CLT) remain scarce. Method(s): Untreated EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with BMs receiving first-line Osimertinib or first-generation EGFR-TKIs at our cancer center were retrospectively enrolled. Progression-free survival (PFS), intracranial PFS (iPFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated in the entire cohort and patient groups created by propensity score matching (PSM). Survival outcomes and pattern of treatment failure were also investigated in patient subgroups stratified by the status of BMs, which was classified as oligo-BM (number<=3 and size<=3cm) and multiple-BM (number>=4 or size>3cm). Result(s): Among the 362 patients enrolled, 265 received first-generation EGFR-TKIs (Gefitinib=196, Erlotinib=69) and the rest 97 received Osimertinib. Patients receiving first-line Osimertinib had more (p<0.001) and larger BMs (p=0.011) than those receiving first-generation EGFR-TKIs. With a median follow-up of 17.1 months (range, 2.6-73 months), median PFS and OS was 14.6 months and 31 months, respectively. Patient groups (Osimertinib=97, first-generation group=97) were created by PSM with balanced clinic-pathological parameters, and iPFS (32.5 vs 8.4 months, p<0.001), PFS (34.7 vs 11.5months,p<0.001) and OS (40.6 vs 23.8 months, p=0.041) were significantly longer in the Osimertinib group (Figure a-c). Upfront CLT, including surgery, whole brain radiotherapy and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS), was performed in 129 patients before disease progression and it prolonged iPFS and PFS, but not OS, in the entire cohort. Among patients with baseline oligo-BMs (n=195), upfront CLT (dominated by SRS) improved iPFS (HR=0.443, p=0.001), PFS (HR=0.373, p<0.001) and OS (HR=0.795, p=0.035) (Figure d-f), which was not the case among patients with baseline multiple-BMs. Pattern of failure analyses indicated that more patients with baseline multiple-BMs turned into the status of oligo-BMs at the maximal response to EGFR-TKIs (p=0.023) and less patients developed progressive disease in the central nervous system (p=0.019) among patients receiving upfront CTL than those didn't. Of note, 8 patients with oligo-BMs but didn't receive upfront CLT developed multiple progressive disease in the brain. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world study with considerable sample size verifying the superior efficacy of first-line Osimertinib treatment in EGFR-mutant NSCLC with BMs. Additionally, upfront brain SRS was recommended for those with oligo-BMs. Keywords: Brain metastasis, osimertinib, cranial radiotherapy Copyright Â© 2021",Excluded,0.54431
768,"Pulmonary tissue volume, cardiac output, and diffusing capacity in sustained microgravity In microgravity (microG) humans have marked changes in body fluids, with a combination of an overall fluid loss and a redistribution of fluids in the cranial direction. We investigated whether interstitial pulmonary edema develops as a result of a headward fluid shift or whether pulmonary tissue fluid volume is reduced as a result of the overall loss of body fluid. We measured pulmonary tissue volume (Vti), capillary blood flow, and diffusing capacity in four subjects before, during, and after 10 days of exposure to microG during spaceflight. Measurements were made by rebreathing a gas mixture containing small amounts of acetylene, carbon monoxide, and argon. Measurements made early in flight in two subjects showed no change in Vti despite large increases in stroke volume (40%) and diffusing capacity (13%) consistent with increased pulmonary capillary blood volume. Late in-flight measurements in four subjects showed a 25% reduction in Vti compared with preflight controls (P < 0.001). There was a concomittant reduction in stroke volume, to the extent that it was no longer significantly different from preflight control. Diffusing capacity remained elevated (11%; P < 0.05) late in flight. These findings suggest that, despite increased pulmonary perfusion and pulmonary capillary blood volume, interstitial pulmonary edema does not result from exposure to microG.",Excluded,0.5301172
486,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases after prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited disease small-cell lung cancer Background: Brain metastases are very common in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has been shown to reduce the incidence of brain metastases and to improve overall survival in patients with limited-disease SCLC (LD-SCLC). However, brain metastases are often observed after PCI, and the optimal treatment for these brain metastases is still unclear. The present study investigated the recurrence of brain metastases after PCI in patients with LD-SCLC and the therapeutic efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery for these metastases. Method(s): Between December 2000 and December 2012, 228 patients with LD-SCLC were treated and 98 of these patients with a complete response (CR) or a near CR to chemoradiotherapy underwent PCI at the National Cancer Center Hospital. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and imaging data for these 98 patients. Result(s): Twenty-four (24%) of the 98 patients developed brain metastases after PCI. The characteristics of the 24 patients were as follows: median age, 62 years (49-72 years), male/female, 21/3; performance status 0/1/2, 2/16/6. Twelve (50%) of the 24 patients had cranial recurrences only. Twelve patients had single brain metastases, and 12 patients had multiple lesions. Nine patients had neurological symptoms due to brain metastases. The median period after PCI until the appearance of the metastases was 9.9 months (1.1-34.9 months). Fifteen (63%) of the 24 patients underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (gamma knife radiosurgery [GKRS]), and one patient received whole brain radiotherapy. Six patients were treated with chemotherapy plus best supportive care (BSC), and two patients underwent BSC alone. The 15 patients who received GKRS had brain metastases with/without extracranial lesions (7 with, 8 without); three were symptomatic, and 12 were asymptomatic. The median number of brain metastases at the time of the first GKRS was one (range, 1-4). The local control rate of the lesions treated with GKRS was 86.7% (complete response in 3 patients, partial response in 7 patients, and stable disease in 3 patients). Five patients underwent further GKRS because of newly developing brain metastases (median: 4 times, range: 2-7 times). The median intracranial control time of the 15 patients was 6.8 months. The median survival time of the 15 patients was 29.3 months after the initial diagnosis, 13.7 months after the development of brain metastases, and 12.7 months after the treatment of GKRS. The median survival time of the patients without extracranial lesions was 20.2 months after the development of brain metastases and tended to be longer than that of the patients with extracranial lesions (12.6 months). Severe adverse events arising from GKRS were not observed in this series. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery may be an effective option as a salvage therapy for brain metastases after PCI in patients with LD-SCLC.",Excluded,0.5179562
