930,"Effect of exposure to low-dose gamma radiation during late organogenesis in the mouse fetus The abdominal region of pregnant Swiss mice was exposed to 0.05 to 0.50 Gy of gamma radiation on day 11.5 postcoitus. The animals were sacrificed on day 18 of gestation and the fetuses were examined for mortality, growth retardation, changes in head size and brain weight, and incidence of microphthalmia. No marked increase in fetal mortality or growth retardation was observed below 0.25 Gy; the increase in these parameters was significant only at 0.50 Gy. A significant reduction in head size and brain weight and a significant increase in the incidence of microphthalmia were observed at doses above 0.15 Gy. Detectable levels of microcephaly and microphthalmia were evident even at 0.10 Gy. A linear dose response was seen for these effects in the dose range of 0.05 to 0.15 Gy. It is concluded that the late period of organogenesis in the mouse, especially between days 10 and 12 postcoitus, is a particularly sensitive phase in the development of the skull, brain and eye.",Excluded,0.9579805
586,"Radiation-induced DNA strand breaks and their repair in the developing rat brain Rats, 5, 10 or 25 days old, were 60 Co gamma irradiated. The induction of DNA strand breaks was studied after killing the rats within 1 min after irradiation, and the repair of the induced breaks after various intervals up to 180 min. Cell suspensions were prepared from the brain and samples were transferred into alkaline solutions. The fraction of DNA remaining double-stranded after 30 min alkali treatment was estimated after separation of single- and double-stranded DNA on hydroxylapatite. The amount of DNA strand breaks induced per Gray (1--8 Gray) was found to be in accordance with earlier in vivo studies of the mouse small intestine and mouse spleen. The DNA strand breaks in the rat brain induced by 4 Gray 60Co gamma irradiation were repaired 30 min after irradiation in all age groups studied.",Excluded,0.9579626
595,"Neonatal gamma-ray irradiation impairs learning and memory of an olfactory associative task in adult rats Adult neonatally gamma-irradiated rats were compared with control animals in a non-spatial olfactory associative task using two different procedures. Irradiation induced a clear reduction in the total mean area of the olfactory bulbs and hippocampus but not of the orbital prefrontal cortex, diagonal band and cell layers of the entorhinal and piriform cortex. The gamma-irradiation affected the granule cells of the olfactory bulbs and differentially altered the cell layers of the subfields of the ammonic fields and the dorsal and ventral blades of the dentate gyrus. In the CA1 ammonic field, dorsal and ventral blades of the dentate gyrus, the cellular loss was significant in comparison with control adult rats. The behavioural data indicated that irradiated rats were deeply disturbed in learning the odour-reward association, and substantially impaired in a reversal experiment, but not in the discrimination of the odours per se. The cellular loss in the olfactory bulbs, in the CA1 and in the ventral blade of the gyrus dentatus was positively correlated with the deficit in behavioural performance. The data support the findings that the hippocampal system participates in the odour-reward associations and facilitates the long-term storage of associations after learning is achieved in this olfactory associative task.",Excluded,0.9578008

538,"Pharmacological alterations that could underlie radiation-induced changes in associative memory and anxiety It is widely known that ionizing radiation is a physical agent broadly used to kill tumor cells during human cancer therapy. Unfortunately, adjacent normal tissues can concurrently undergo undesirable cell injury. Previous data of our laboratory demonstrated that exposure of developing rats to ionizing radiations induced a variety of behavioral differences respect to controls, including changes in associative memory and in anxiety state. However, there is a lack of data concerning modifications in different related pharmacological intermediaries. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether the behavioral differences observed in young animals irradiated at birth might be underlain by early changes in PKCs1 levels which, in turn, could lead to changes in hippocampal GABAergic neurotransmission. Male Wistar rats were irradiated with 5Gy of X rays between 24 and 48 h after birth. Different pharmacological markers related to the affected behavioral tasks were assessed in control and irradiated hippocampus at 15 and 30 days, namely GABAA receptor, GAD65-67, ROS and PKCs1. Results showed that all measured parameters were increased in the hippocampus of 30-days-old irradiated animals. In contrast, in the hippocampus of 15-days-old irradiated animals only the levels of PKCs1 were decreased. These data suggest that PKCs1 might constitute a primary target for neonatal radiation damage on the hippocampus. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that an initial decrease in the levels of this protein can trigger a subsequent compensatory increase that, in turn, could be responsible for the plethora of biochemical changes that might underlie the previously observed behavioral alterations.",Excluded,0.957529
525,"Cognitive Impairments in Subjects Exposed to Radiation during Prenatal Development Objective. To evaluate cognitive status in subjects exposed to ionizing radiation during antenatal development. Materials and methods. A total of 77 subjects with antenatal exposure to radiation were studied, along with a reference group of 73 subjects living in radiologically unpolluted territories in the Chelyabinsk region. Clinical, clinical psychological (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test (WAIS), and proverb interpretation) neurophysiological (EEG), and laboratory (cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoproteins triglycerides, cortisol, melatonin) methods were used. Results and discussion. These investigations showed that a significantly greater proportion of subjects exposed to radiation during antenatal development had nonpsychotic mental disorders with a predominance of organic mental impairments (cognitive and asthenic). Neurophysiological studies identified more profound abnormalities in brain bioelectrical activity with pathological rhythms and a predominance of the theta rhythm among those exposed to radiation. Clinical psychological study data identified a significant decrease in analytical-synthetic ability in irradiated subjects, along with lower general and verbal IQ levels. These changes were accompanied by higher cortisol and melatonin levels, supporting activation of and tension in the mechanisms of adaptation in subjects irradiated during antenatal development.

539,"Long-lasting effects of neonatal ionizing radiation exposure on spatial memory and anxiety-like behavior Neonatal ionizing radiation exposure has been shown to induce a cerebellar cytoarchitecture disarrangement. Since cerebellar abnormalities have been linked to an impairment of behavioral functions, the aim of the present work was to investigate whether exposure of developing rats to ionizing radiations can produce behavioral deficits in the adult. Male Wistar rats were X-irradiated with 5Gy within 48h after birth and were tested in a radial maze and in an open field at 30 and 90 days post irradiation. Irradiated rats showed significative changes in spatial, exploratory, and procedural parameters in the radial maze, as well as a significative decrease in anxiety-like behavior, assessed in the open field. These results suggest that ionizing radiations can induce long-lasting spatial memory and anxiety-related changes.

[Russian] The comparative study of effects of low doses of radiation on peripheral blood lymphocytes of persons occupationally exposed to radiation and non-exposed ones was carried out. The main attention was paid to radio-adaptive response forming under consistent exposure to low (0.05 Gy) and damaging (2 Gy) doses of gamma-irradiation.

1155,"Evidence of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and identification of dying cells in X-ray-induced cell death in the developing brain Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats received a single dose of 2 Gy X-rays and were killed 6 hr later. Dying cells were characterized by extreme chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Dying cells were distributed in the primary and secondary germinal zones and in other brain regions. Among these latter, dying cells occurred in the cortical layers of the olfactory bulb, layers II-III and VIb of the neocortex, piriform and entorhinal cortex, stratum oriens and pyramidale of the hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, amygdala, brainstem, internal granular layer of the cerebellum, and cerebral and cerebellar white matter. Dying cells were immature cells, neurons and glial cells (including radial glia). In-situ labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation identified individual cells bearing fragmented DNA. Since the number of cells stained with this method was larger than the number of dying cells, as revealed with current histological techniques, it is suggested that nuclear DNA fragmentation precedes chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation in X-ray-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, agarose gel electrophoresis of extracted DNA from irradiated brains showed a ""ladder"" pattern which is typical of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and endonuclease activation.",Excluded,0.95703727
753,"Mitigation of radiation myelopathy and reduction of microglial infiltration by Ramipril, ACE inhibitor STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor Ramipril, as a mitigator of radiation-induced spinal cord injury.SETTING: Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.METHODS: Total of 22 rats were irradiated with single doses of 23.6-33 Gy at the C4-T2 spinal levels. After irradiation, the rats were randomized to the radiation only control group and the Ramipril-treated (radiation + Ramipril) experimental group. Ramipril 1.5 mg/kg/day was given in the drinking water starting 1 week after radiation through the study duration.RESULTS: All the rats irradiated with 28.5-33 Gy became paralyzed at 125 +/- 4 days, whereas no rats became paralyzed after 23.6 Gy. The time to develop paralysis was delayed to 135 +/- 4 days in Ramipril-treated group (P < 0.001). H&E and LFB showed microscopic structural restoration and remyelination with Ramipril treatment. VEGF expression was increased in the irradiated spinal cord, and the number of VEGF-positive cells was significantly decreased by Ramipril treatment (P < 0.001). Immunohistochemical stain with Iba-1 showed increased microglial infiltration in the irradiated spinal cords. The number of Iba-1-positive microglia was significantly reduced by Ramipril treatment (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Ramipril reduced the rate of paralysis even at the paralysis-inducing radiation doses. It also significantly delayed the onset of paralysis. Neuroinflammation and endothelial cell damage may be the key mediators of radiation injury. Ramipril can be readily translatable to clinical application as a mitigatory of radiotherapeutic toxicity.",Excluded,0.9570362

Immediately after a unique injection of a high dose of tretamine and 24 hours after the last of four applications of 0,25 to 2,0 mg/kg which were repeated each after one day, the sleeping time after hexobarbital was prolonged. 24 hours after fractionated injection of tretamine (0,5 mg/kg each time), the concentration of hexobarbital in the brain showed a significant increase compared with the control animals. These results show that the decreased effect of hexobarbital in the early post-irradiation phase is based on pharmacodynamic processes while the increase of the effect produced by continued administration of tretamine can be explained by pharmaco-cinetic reasons.",Excluded,0.9567611

The present study was undertaken to investigate the pretreatment effects of standardized Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) and low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation on the neurological dysfunction in the reserpine model of PD. Male Wistar rats were pretreated orally with EGb761 or fractionated low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation or their combination, then subjected to intraperitoneal injection of reserpine (5 mg/kg body weight) 24 h after the final dose of EGb761 or radiation. Reserpine injection resulted in the depletion of striatal dopamine (DA) level, increased catalepsy score, increased oxidative stress indicated via depletion of glutathione (GSH), increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and iron levels, decreased DA metabolites metabolizing enzymes; indicated by inhibition by glutathione-S-transferase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-quinone oxidoreductase (NQO) activities, mitochondrial dysfunction; indicated by declined complex I activity, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level and increased apoptosis; indicated by decreased mitochondrial B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein level and by transmission electron microscope. EGb761 and low-dose gamma-radiation ameliorated the reserpine-induced state of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis in brain. It can be concluded that EGb761, a widely used herbal medicine and low dose of gamma-irradiation have protective effects for combating Parkinsonism possibly via replenishment of GSH levels.

In a cohort of 342 patients operated and irradiated for pituitary tumors, 31 died from CVD (CVD patients) between 1952 and 1996. The study assessed whether the radiation regimens and duration of symptoms of hypopituitarism before operation differed between the 31 CVD patients and the 62 matched patients from the same cohort who had not died from CVD (control patients). Furthermore, the infarction/hemorrhage ratio, type of clinical stroke syndrome, and time to death after stroke were investigated in the CVD patients and in matched controls from the general population who had died from CVD (population controls). No significant differences in maximum or centrally absorbed dose, maximum or central biological equivalent dose, field size, or number of fraction were recorded between CVD and control patients. A significant difference in the duration of symptoms of hypopituitarism before operation was recorded, but only in women (P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in the infarction/hemorrhage ratio (P > 0.3) of lacunar or posterior circulation syndrome compared with middle cerebral artery syndrome with cortical features (P = 0.22) or the proportion of patients who died within the first month after stroke onset (60% vs. 59%, respectively) between CVD patients and population controls. In conclusion, no significant effect on CVD deaths could be detected for any radiation parameter. A long history of unsubstituted pituitary insufficiency may be a contributing factor to the very high CVD mortality among women.

Effects of early x-irradiation schedules that allow or prevent the acquisition of basket cells In neonate and infant rats the area of cerebellum was irradiated with different schedules of single or multiple doses of low-level X-ray. One set of schedules allowed the early recovery of the external germinal layer and the differentiation of all the postnatally-forming cell types while the other selectively prevented the acquisition of basket cells. The first schedule did not interfere with the development of normally oriented and arborizing Purkinje cells. The second schedule led to the growth of twisted and entwined stem dendrites even when, in association, with the recovered granule cells, parallel fibers were present in the molecular layer together with Purkinje cell spiny branchlets. Evidence was presented that the alignment of Purkinje cell perikarya in a monolayer does not guarantee the normal growth of Purkinje cell stem dendrites which may be dependent on the presence of basket cells.

Consequently, these radiation-induced DPCs could be used to detect hypoxic cells or estimate the hypoxic fraction of cells in solid tumors. Although several techniques, including alkaline elution, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and nitrocellulose filter binding, have been used to measure radiation-induced DPCs, the published reports suggest that the characteristics of these DPCs may depend on both the type of sample irradiated (cellular compared to model systems, oxygenated compared to hypoxic, etc.) and the technique used to measure these radiation-induced DPCs. In the present study, the radiation-induced DPCs measured by our alkaline elution technique with and without proteinase K in the lysis solution were characterized by studying the dependence of their formation on temperature in hypoxic rat 9L brain tumor cells. Exponentially growing 9L rat brain tumor cells were rendered hypoxic at 4degreeC or at 37degreeC and then irradiated with either 7.5 Gy or 15 Gy. The cells were trypsinized at 4degreeC, either immediately after the irradiation or after one half-time of strand break repair at 37degreeC. The results demonstrated that the radiation- induced DPCs produced in 9L cells under hypoxic conditions, measured by our alkaline elution technique after low to moderate radiation doses, required metabolism for their formation, unlike the radiation-induced DPCs reported by others using the GC/MS or nitrocellulose filter binding technique.",Excluded,0.95481485

Aiming to study how glioma cells respond to gamma-rays in terms of biological processes involved in cellular responses, we performed experiments at cellular context and gene expression analysis in U343-MG-a GBM cells irradiated with 1 Gy and collected at 6 h post-irradiation. The survival rate was approximately 61% for 1 Gy and was completely reduced at 16 Gy. By performing the microarray technique, 859 cDNA clones were analyzed.

Differential expression patterns of five selected genes (HSPA9B, INPP5A, PIP5K1A, FANCG, and TPP2) observed by the microarray analysis were further confirmed by the quantitative real time RT-PCR method, which demonstrated an up-regulation status of those genes.

[French] Accidental irradiations induce a complex pathological situation, difficult to assess and to treat. However, recent results describing new biological indicators of radiation-induced damages such as Flt3-ligand, citrulline and oxysterol concentration in the plasma, together with results obtained in large animal models of high dose irradiation, allowed a better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms induced by uncontrolled irradiations.

Follow-up of victims from two recent radiation accidents brings a confirmation of the usefulness of the newly described biological indicators, and also a partial confirmation of this new concept of a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

This leads to measurement artifacts when the detector is too large, as was readily observed with ionization chambers. Radiographic and radiochromic films were used with densitometric evaluation to provide the resolution necessary to measure absorbed doses for the narrowest beams. The contribution by phantom-scattered photons is significant even at small field sizes, and scatter factors were determined from the experimental results.

Methods and Results We conducted a retrospective cohort study within a provincial linked database of 5718 cardiac patients with thorax and head or neck cancer having undergone radiotherapy between 2000 and 2011. One thousand five hundred fifty-two patients were identified as nonstatin users and 4166 as statin users. The primary outcome of interest was the composite of cerebrovascular (transient ischemic attack, and fatal or nonfatal stroke) or cardiovascular events (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction). Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed. The crude event rate was 10.31% for nonusers and 9.03% for statin users (hazard ratio of 0.92 [95% CI 0.76-1.10, P=0.3451]), over a mean time to event/censoring of 534+/-687 days for nonusers and 594+/-706 days for the statin users. After adjusting for age, sex, prior history of stroke/transient ischemic attack or myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and hypertension, statin use postradiotherapy was associated with a nonsignificant 15% relative risk reduction, but a strong trend toward reducing the primary outcome (hazard ratio=0.85 95% CI 0.69-1.04, P=0.0811). The use of statins was associated with a significant reduction of 32% for the outcome of stroke alone (hazard ratio=0.68, 95% CI 0.48-0.98, P=0.0368).

The purpose of our study was to determine the potential of echo planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in detecting subacute radiation induced injury to the normal brain.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients with brain metastases and three patients with lung cancer underwent cranial irradiation. These patients were subjected to 3D-EPSI and DTI at two time points (pre-radiation, and 1 month post-irradiation). Parametric maps of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) were generated and co-registered to post-contrast T1-weighted images. Normal appearing gray-matter and white-matter regions were compared between the two time points to assess sub-acute effects of radiation using independent sample t-tests.RESULTS: Significantly increased MD (P = .02), Cho/Cr (P = .02) and a trend towards a decrease in NAA/Cr (P = .06) was observed from the hippocampus. Significant decrease in FA (P = .02) from the centrum-semiovale and a significant increase in MD (P = .04) and Cho/Cr (P = .02) from genu of corpus-callosum was also observed.CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that 3D-EPSI and DTI may provide quantitative measures of radiation induced injury to the normal brain.",Excluded,0.9533488

In this study, we aimed to detect WM changes throughout the brain of NPC patients by DTI. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used to analyze DTI data from 81 NPC patients. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were quantified across the whole brain in separate groups: pre-RT, and <6, 6-12, and >12 months post-RT. We found that fractional anisotropy values were significantly lower in the right frontal, parietal, and occipital WM <6 months post-RT compared with pre-RT and remained significantly lower in the right frontal and parietal WM at >12 months. MD values were significantly higher in the right occipital, bilateral temporal, right occipital-temporal junction, left parietal, left centrum semiovale, and left frontal-parietal junction WM <6 months post-RT and remained higher in the right occipital WM at >12 months. This study suggests that changes in white matter microstructure following RT for NPC were widespread, complex, and dynamic. Diffusion tensor imaging with TBSS analysis allows for early non-invasive detection of RT-induced WM damage.",Excluded,0.95236033
33,"Variation in radiation sensitivity and repair kinetics in different parts of the spinal cord BACKGROUND: The spinal cord, known for its strongly serial character and high sensitivity to radiation even when a small segment is irradiated, is one of the most critical organs at risk to be spared during radiation therapy. To compare the sensitivity of different parts of the spinal cord, data for radiation myelopathy have been used.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present study, the relative seriality model was fitted to two different datasets of clinical radiation myelitis concerning cervical spinal cord after treating 248 patients for head and neck cancer and thoracic spinal cord after treating 43 patients with lung carcinoma. The maximum likelihood method was applied to fit the clinical data. The model parameters and their 68% confidence intervals were calculated for each dataset. The alpha/beta ratio for the thoracic cord was also was also found to be 0.9 (0-3.0) Gy.RESULTS: The dose-response curve for the more sensitive cervical myelopathy is well described by the parameters D(50)=55.9 (54.8-57.1) Gy, gamma=6.9 (5.0-9.2), s=0.13 (0.07-0.24), whereas the thoracic myelopathy is described by the parameters D(50)=75.5 (70.5-80.8) Gy, gamma=1.1 (0.6-1.6), s=36 (3.3-infinity).DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Large differences in radiation response between the cervical and thoracic region of spinal cord are thus observed: cervical myelopathy seems to be characterized by medium seriality, while thoracic spinal cord is characterized by a highly serial dose-response. The much steeper dose-response curve for cervical spinal cord myelopathy can be interpreted as a higher number of functional subunits consistent with a higher amount of white matter close to the brain.",Excluded,0.95225567
1037,"Single photon emission computed tomography in long-term survivors of adult brain tumours Sixteen patients with primary brain tumours were examined on average eight years after treatment with surgery or whole brain irradiation using standard clinical assessment, CT, a neuropsychological test battery, and single photon emission CT (SPECT) with 99mTc-exametazime. Seventeen lesions were discovered on inspection of SPECT images, 11 with x-ray CT. Quantitative assessment of tracer uptake compared with 16 matched healthy volunteers was consistent with the presence of lesions. Measurement of uptake in brain regions of the hemisphere not containing the primary tumour still showed significant reductions in patients. This may be due to remote direct effects of the tumour or, more likely, to the whole brain irradiation received. Psychometric performance on most tests was significantly impaired in the patient group and was correlated with abnormalities of tracer uptake to relevant brain regions.",Excluded,0.95223117

Our persistent interest to clarify the biologically significant damage caused by high LET radiation needs multilayered approaches including molecular, cellular and tissue levels; all the levels being deeply integrated with physics. The outcome of our research is important for (1) promoting the evidence-based radiotherapy and (2) clarifying the radiation risk in space. We are currently conducting the following experiments; LET-RBE relationship for cell kills, chromatin damages and mutation induction, mitochondrial damages, brain damages at cellular and behavioral level, and fractionated irradiation to skin, gut and tumors. Capacity of cells to repair DNA damages may play an important role in space radiation environment that is characterized as a long-term exposure at low dose rates with mixed LET radiation. Experiments using cells deficient of DNA repair suggested that a process of damage recognition is critical for biological effectiveness of high LET radiation. Specific for space radiation research, we have started a long-term exposure of cultured cells to secondary beams produced at the HIMAC Biology Room.

[Chinese] Objective: We studied the effect of reirradiation to the vestibular apparatus in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC). Patients and Methods: A total of 52 reirradiated NPC patients underwent regular follow-up at Tzu Chi Hospital. Nine were diagnosed with vestibular apparatus disorders, based on detailed histories and balance function tests which included an illegible E-test, and refixation saccade test as well as bithermal air caloric and rotary chair tests. The clinical characteristics were analyzed. Result(s): Of 9 patients with vestibular apparatus disorders, seven had bilateral loss of vestibular function, one had vestibular neuronitis and one had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The 7 patients with bilateral loss of vestibular function had bilateral otitis media and moderate to profound bilateral hearing loss. Illegible E-test, refixation saccade test, electronystagmography, bithermal air caloric test and rotary chair test are useful tools for diagnosis. All 9 patients received total radiation dosages over 12,000 cGy. Conclusion(s): Bilateral loss of vestibular function is the most common vestibular apparatus disorder in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma following reirradiation.

Method(s): Sixteen patients underwent fractionated proton therapy (PT) receiving dose to the healthy tissue because of direct or indirect (base skull tumors) irradiation. MWI was performed by a multi-echo sequence with 32 equally spaced echoes (10-320 ms). Decay data were processed to identify 3 T<inf>2</inf> compartments: myelin water (Mw) below 40 ms, intra-extracellular water (IEw) between 40 and 250 ms, and free water (CSFw) above 250 ms. Both MWI and DTI scans were acquired pre (pre)-treatment and immediately at the end (end) of PT. After image registration, voxel-wise difference maps, obtained by subtracting MWI and DTI pre from those acquired at the end of PT, were compared with the corresponding biological equivalent dose (BED). Result(s): Mw difference showed a positive correlation and IEw difference showed a negative correlation with BED considering end-pre changes (P <.01). The changes in CSFw were not significantly correlated with the delivered BED. The changes in DTI data, considering end-pre acquisitions, showed a positive correlation between fractional anisotropy and the delivered BED. Conclusion(s): MWI might detect early white matter radiation-induced alterations, providing additional information to DTI, which might improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of the radiation damage.

Seventeen patients with glioma WHO grade III-IV treated with FRT were included in this prospective study, seven were excluded because of inconsistent FRT protocol or missing examinations. Dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI and contrast-enhanced 3D-T1-weighted (3D-T1w) images were acquired prior to and in average (standard deviation): 3.1 (3.3), 34.4 (9.5) and 103.3 (12.9) days after FRT. Pre-FRT 3D-T1w images were segmented into white- and grey matter. Cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps were calculated and co-registered patient-wise to pre-FRT 3D-T1w images. Seven radiation dose regions were created for each tissue type: 0-5 Gy, 5-10 Gy, 10-20 Gy, 20-30 Gy, 30-40 Gy, 40-50 Gy and 50-60 Gy. Mean CBV and CBF were calculated in each dose region and normalised (nCBV and nCBF) to the mean CBV and CBF in 0-5 Gy white- and grey matter reference regions, respectively. Regional and global nCBV and nCBF in white- and grey matter decreased after FRT, followed by a tendency to recover. The response of nCBV and nCBF was dose-dependent in white matter but not in grey matter. Our data suggest that radiation-induced perfusion changes occur in normal-appearing brain tissue after FRT. This can cause an overestimation of relative tumour perfusion using dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI, and can thus confound tumour treatment evaluation.

1097,"The role of functional imaging in the diagnosis and management of late normal tissue injury Normal tissue injury after radiation therapy (RT) can be defined based on either clinical symptoms or laboratory/radiologic tests. In the research setting, functional imaging (eg, single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT], positron-emission tomography [PET], and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) is useful because it provides objective quantitative data such as metabolic activity, perfusion, and soft-tissue contrast within tissues and organs. For RT-induced lung, heart, and parotid gland injury, pre- and post-RT SPECT images can be compared with the dose- and volume-dependent nature of regional injury. In the brain, SPECT can detect changes in perfusion and blood flow post-RT, and PET can detect metabolic changes, particularly to regions of the brain that have received doses above 40 to 50 Gy. On MRI, changes in contrast-enhanced images, T(1) and T(2) relaxation times, and pulmonary vascular resistance at different intervals pre- and post-RT show its ability to detect and distinguish different phases of radiation pneumonitis. Similarly, conventional and diffusion-weighted MRI can be used to differentiate between normal tissue edema, necrosis, and tumor in the irradiated brain, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy can measure changes in compounds, indicative of membrane and neuron disruption. The use of functional imaging is a powerful tool for early detection of RT-induced normal tissue injury, which may be related to long-term clinically significant injury.

Brain homogenates from 22-month-old rats were more susceptible to oxidative stress than those from three-month- old rats. Brain was more susceptible to oxidative damage than the heart.

Dose-dependence of the overall spectrum There is considerable controversy in the literature concerning the nature of X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in various experimental organisms. To investigate this problem in Neurospora crassa a series of experiments (Webber and de Serres, 1965) was performed to study the induction-kinetics of X-ray-induced mutation in the adenine-3 (ad-3) region of a two-component heterokaryon (H-12). Subsequent genetic analyses (de Serres, 1989a,b,c, 1990a), on a series of 832 mutants recovered in these experiments, have shown that 3 different classes of ad-3 mutants were recovered, namely gene/point mutations, multilocus deletions and multiple-site mutations. Complementation studies with a series of genetic markers that define 21 genetic loci in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent genetic regions have shown that ad-3 mutants classified as multilocus deletions result from the inactivation of a series of loci in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent regions of Linkage Group I, whereas multiple-locus mutations result from combinations of gene/point mutations and multilocus deletions. Analysis of the induction kinetics of these 3 different classes, after completion of the genetic characterization of all mutants (de Serres, 1990b) demonstrated that gene/point mutations increase linearly with X-ray dose, whereas multilocus deletions and multiple-site mutations increase as the square of X-ray dose. Further analysis of allelic complementation among the gene/point mutations at the ad-3B locus (de Serres, 1990c), demonstrated that the spectrum of complementation patterns was dose-dependent: complementing mutants with nonpolarized patterns decreased and noncomplementing mutations increased with increasing X-ray dose. There was little or no change with dose in the frequency of mutants with polarized patterns. In the present report, data from studies published previously have been utilized, along with additional data from the original X-ray experiments (12-5, 12-6, 12-7, and 12-10; see Webber and de Serres, 1965) to develop composite complementation maps of the X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent regions as a function of X-ray dose. This analysis of the overall spectrum of X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region demonstrated marked dose-dependence and provides an explanation for the discrepancies in the literature with regard to specific-locus studies in different experimental organisms.",Excluded,0.94871217

The baboon model proved to be a valuable technique to assess the in vivo radiobiologic response of single-fraction irradiation doses delivered to the primate brain stem. Multimodality neurodiagnostic testing, including CT, MR imaging, xenon-enhanced CT, evoked potential studies, and analysis of CSF myelin basic protein levels, all of which eventually were correlated with neuropathologic examination, enabled detection of lesions produced with high-dose (150 Gy) radiosurgery as early as 6 weeks. Within the first 6 months after radiosurgery, lower doses (20 Gy, 50 Gy) did not result in clinically or neurodiagnostically detectable lesions. The rat arteriovenous fistula model permits analysis of the delayed histopathologic effects of radiosurgery on an experimentally created fistula designed to mimic an AVM. The rat C6 glioma model is designed to evaluate the effect of radiosurgery in an infiltrative tumor that simulates a human malignant brain tumor. These studies are intended eventually to increase our knowledge about the safety and efficacy of radiosurgery in both the normal and tumor-implanted brains. We believe that such fundamental studies ultimately will improve our ability to reach the goals of radiosurgery: to destroy the target and spare the surrounding brain. Eventually, it may become feasible to achieve these goals by combining radiosurgical technique with both radiation sensitizers (for the treated volume) and brain protectors.

We utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with multiple b-values (diffusion weightings) to model the dose-dependency and time course of radiation effects on white matter.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with high-grade gliomas treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy underwent MRI with DTI prior to radiotherapy, and after months 1, 4-6, and 9-11. Diffusion tensors were calculated using three weightings (high, standard, and low b-values) and maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (lambda<sub></sub>), and radial diffusivity (lambda<sub></sub>) were generated. The region of interest was all white matter.RESULTS: MD, lambda<sub></sub>, and lambda<sub></sub> increased significantly with time and dose, with corresponding decrease in FA. Greater changes were seen at lower b-values, except for FA. Time-dose interactions were highly significant at 4-6months and beyond (p<.001), and the difference in dose response between high and low b-values reached statistical significance at 9-11months for MD, lambda<sub></sub>, and lambda<sub></sub> (p<.001, p<.001, p=.005 respectively) as well as at 4-6months for lambda<sub></sub> (p=.04).CONCLUSIONS: We detected dose-dependent changes across all doses, even <10Gy.

1080,"Carbamylated erythropoietin reduces radiosurgically-induced brain injury Gamma knife radiosurgery is an attractive noninvasive treatment of brain tumors and vascular malformations that minimizes collateral tissue damage. However, exposure of normal tissue to even low-dose radiation triggers a cascade of acute and chronic injury and potentially significant morbidity and mortality. Because many irradiated patients now survive for years, identifying methods to prevent radiotherapy-induced collateral tissue damage is a major focus of current research. Erythropoietin (EPO), a cytokine produced locally by many tissues in response to injury, antagonizes apoptosis, reduces inflammation, and promotes healing. Systemic administration of recombinant EPO, widely used for treatment of anemia, provides robust protection from numerous insults in a variety of tissues, including the brain. Although irradiation injury is likely sensitive to EPO, the hematopoietic activity of EPO is undesirable in this setting, increasing erythrocyte number and predisposing to thrombosis. To avoid these potential adverse effects, we developed carbamylated EPO (CEPO) which does not stimulate the bone marrow. In this study, we show that CEPO (50 microg kg(-1) intraperitoneally) improves functional outcome when administered to adult rats just before, and then once daily for 10 d after, a necrotizing dose of radiation (100 Gy) to the right striatum. Immediately following irradiation, use and reflex movements of the contralateral forelimb to vibrissae stimulation were abnormal but rapidly improved in animals receiving CEPO.

The sp. act. of OMMT in rat liver can be induced by approximately 12- to 20-fold by treatment of the rats with ionizing radiation. The effects of dose and time were investigated in this study. We have found that OMMT sp. act. can be increased, although to a lower extent, in kidney, spleen and brain in addition to liver. However, the sp. act. of OMMT in lung was reduced by irradiation. OMMT has been purified from the livers of irradiated rats by solubilization in high-salt-containing buffer, ammonium sulfate precipitation and a series of column chromatographic steps, including phenyl-Sepharose, heparin-agarose, double-stranded DNA-cellulose and FPLC. A 3000-fold enrichment of OMMT was achieved from the induced liver preparations. However, with regard to the sp. act. of this protein in normal rat liver, the fold purification was approximately 35,000.

[Japanese] Radiation-induced brain injury is a life-threatening or at least QOL-compromising pathological entity induced by therapeutic irradiation to malignant brain tumors. Although life-threatening late delayed radiation necrosis and radiation-induced leukoencephalopathy had been assumed to be major complications of radiation therapy to the brain classically, these complications seem to be less frequently seen in therapeutic irradiation to the brain recently because in many treatment protocols to brain tumors, irradiation field is now confined to tumors and their margins and adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of methothrexate etc. has been avoided as much as possible. Instead, less aggressive but still QOL-compromising encephalopathy has been recognized for the past 20 years. This encephalopathy occurs in senior adults several months after the extended field irradiation with even less amount of irradiation dose such as 40 Gy whole brain irradiation. This encephalopathy is characterized by cognitive impairment and brain atrophy which attenuates QOL of the patients. In this article, these radiation-induced brain injuries are reviewed clinically, etiologically and hisotopathologically based on reports in the literature.",Excluded,0.94602054

Monomers and small oligomers of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, players in Alzheimer's disease, are recently suggested to be involved in damaging of neurons, instead of extracellular Abeta plaques. We demonstrate that externally applied disaggregated Abeta<sub>1-42</sub> peptide interacts preferentially with acidic compartments (lysosomes). We compared standard cell cultivation (21% O<sub>2</sub>) to more physiological cell cultivation (5% O<sub>2</sub>). Cells did not exhibit a dramatic increase in ROS and change in glutathione level upon 4 muM Abeta peptide treatment, whereas exposure to 2 Gy X-rays increased ROS and changed glutathione level and ATP concentration. The occurrence of the 4977 bp deletion in mtDNA and significant protein carbonylation were specific effects of IR and more pronounced at 21% O<sub>2</sub>. An increase in cell death after Abeta peptide treatment or irradiation was unexpectedly restored to the control level or below when both were combined, particularly at 5% O<sub>2</sub>.

Within the first day postflight, the magnitude of response to an applied translation was on average three times greater than for controls.

816,"Fate of the multiple innervation of cerebellar Purkinje cells by climbing fibers in immature control, x-irradiated and hypothyroid rats The fate of the multiple innervation of Purkinje cells (PCs) by climbing fibers (CFs) was studied as a function of age in immature rats rendered agranular by X-irradiation, in immature hypothyroid rats, and compared to that in controls. This was done by examining in each group the intracellular activities of PCs mediated via CFs throughout maturation. From the third day in control rats, CF responses of PCs evoked by juxta fastigial region (JF) stimulation or occurring spontaneously already resembled the adult responses with, however, some important differences: (1) most of these responses were graded by steps with the intensity of the stimulation before day 13, due to the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs (see below); (2) immature CF responses exhibited a longer duration and their initial spike started near the peak of the EPSP instead of near the baseline later on. Finally, an anlage of CF response was already present in most PCs on day 2, and consisted of a single fast spike elicited near the peak of an underlying all-or-none EPSP. In the 3 groups of rats, CF EPSPs already closely resembled the adult ones as early as 3 days, although their total duration and especially their time to peak were longer. In control rats, these CF EPSPs reversed with depolarizing currents from day 3 and currents for reversal were much lower than in the adult. 'Dual' CF EPSPs of PCS37 were encountered in immature 7- to 10-day-old controls, and persisted in hypothyroid rats until the end of the third postnatal week. The mono- or the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was ascertained in th 3 groups according to the graded or the all-or-none character of CF EPSPs, and the number of CFs impinging on a given PC was estimated by the number of steps in the response. In control rats, most of PCs were already multiply innervated by CFs as early as 3 days. The multiple innervation culminated on day 5 with an average number of 3.4 CFs for PC, and rapidly regressed later on, so that the adult-type monoinnervation was the rule after day 13. In hypothyroid rats, the establishment of the redundancy and its regression was delayed by 2--3 days. In X-irradiated rats, the settlement and the involution of the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was exactly superimposed with that seen in controls until day 8. Later on, regression of the supernumerary contacts no longer occurred so that most PCs remained multiply innervated until adulthood. Finally, the first clear-cut IPSPs were detected in PCs on day 9 in control and X-irradiated rats and 2--3 days later in hypothyroid animals.",Excluded,0.9459019

This review comprehends an up to date of recent studies including complete neuropsychological battery and/or advanced neuroimaging techniques. These studies identified critical anatomical and/or functional brain areas related to radiation-induced brain injury, thus improving clinical and radiological diagnosis. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive toxicity are complex and involve different cell lines and molecules. Although there is no currently therapeutic strategy that has a demonstrated efficacy, several studies including sparing of hippocampus or the use of memantine are quite promising. A better knowledge of the characteristics of cognitive toxicity induced by cranial radiation, will help us to identify patients who will benefit from treatment and also to examine new therapeutic targets in order to improve patients' quality of life.

772,"A role for oligodendrocytes in the stabilization of optic axon numbers Differentiated oligodendrocytes express neurite growth inhibitory proteins at a time when these cells are involved in the myelination of recently formed fiber pathways. As the process of myelination follows the completion of neurite outgrowth and is concurrent with the stabilization of fiber numbers in a pathway, we set out to determine whether myelination and fiber tract stability could be causally related. Myelin formation was prevented in the rat retinofugal pathway by x-irradiating the optic nerves during oligodendrocyte proliferation. Electron microscopic and immunohistochemical analysis of irradiated optic nerves at P15 showed that oligodendrocytes and myelin were virtually absent. Optic fiber numbers were determined at 2 weeks of age throughout the length of normal and x-irradiated nerves. In some cases, normal or irradiation-treated pups were intraocularly injected with FGF 5 d prior to the fiber count in order to promote neurite outgrowth. Axon counts showed that the total fiber number in a myelin-free optic nerve was 10-30% higher than that of a myelinated nerve. Further, fiber numbers fluctuated by as much as 20% along the length of a myelin-free nerve but were relatively constant throughout the length of a myelinated nerve. Treatment of myelinated nerves with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) had no effect on either total fiber numbers or fiber number fluctuation. Conversely, fiber numbers in myelin-free/FGF-treated optic nerves were as much as 40% higher than in normals. Furthermore, total fiber numbers along the length of these nerves fluctuated by up to 34%. These results indicate that, in the absence of myelination, optic fibers are able to form sprouts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded,0.94386524

1134,"Endovascular treatment for carotid artery stenosis after neck irradiation BACKGROUND: To lower the risk of complications, carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has been proposed as an alternative to open surgery for carotid artery stenosis after neck irradiation. However, there are little postoperative data to support the benefits of this strategy. This study evaluated the outcome of CAS in patients who had undergone neck irradiation.METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at 15 vascular surgery or interventional radiology centers in France between January 1998 and July 2006. A total of 135 patients (115 men) with a mean age of 67 +/- 8 years (range, 43-88) underwent CAS for 149 irradiation-induced lesions. The interval between irradiation and discovery of the lesions was 12 +/- 8 years. Mean diameter reduction was 81% (range, 50%-95%), and stenosis was symptomatic in 34%. Contralateral carotid lesions were observed in 48% of patients, including thrombosis in 18 and stenosis >50% in 53.RESULTS: Technical failure occurred during CAS in three cases. The overall technical success rate was 98%. A cerebral protection device was used in 59%. No death, one transient ischemic attack, and two strokes occurred during the first postoperative month. Mean follow-up was 30 months. Six patients were lost to follow-up. Survival rates were 93.9% at 1 year and 75.3% at 3 years. Complications after the first postoperative month included neurologic events in six, carotid thrombosis in nine, and restenosis in 18. The rates of freedom from neurologic and anatomic events were, respectively, 96.2% and 93.2% at 1 year and 93.1% and 85.9% at 3 years.CONCLUSION: The immediate outcome of CAS for irradiation-induced carotid artery stenosis was satisfactory.

In our study, we compared the prophylactic and therapeutic usage of a promising agent, ramipril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), with that of bevacizumab for reducing radiation-induced brain injury after high-dose stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).METHODS: A total of 60 Wistar rats were used. The rats were irradiated with a single dose of 50 Gy using a Leksell Gamma Knife device. Bevacizumab and ramipril were administered in the prophylactic protocol (starting the first day of SRS) and in the therapeutic protocol (starting the fourth week of SRS). Their usage was continued until 12 weeks, and the right frontal lobes of the rats were examined histologically (hematoxylin and eosin stain) and immunohistochemically (hypoxia-inducible factor [HIF]-1alpha, VEGF, and CD31 antibody expression).RESULTS: The expression of VEGF, HIF-1alpha, and CD31 had significantly increased at 12 weeks after SRS compared with the control group. The addition of bevacizumab or ramipril to SRS significantly mitigated the histological severity of radiation injury and the expression of VEGF, HIF-1alpha, and CD31. However, the prophylactic use of bevacizumab and ramipril seemed to be more effective than therapeutic administration. Our results also revealed that the greatest benefit was achieved with the use of prophylactic administration of bevacizumab compared with other treatment protocols.CONCLUSIONS: Ramipril might be a promising agent for patients with radionecrosis.

Consequently studies were undertaken to examine the interactions between gamma-rays and EMF on human health. In this study, exposure to 900-MHz EMF expanded gamma-ray damage to SHG44 cells. Preexposure EMF enhanced the decrease in cell proliferation induced by gamma-ray irradiation and the rate of apoptosis. The combination of EMF and gamma-ray exposure resulted in a synergistic effect by triggering stress response, which increased reactive oxygen species, but the expression of hsp70 at both mRNA and protein levels remained unaltered.

In an attempt to overcome this problem, fast neutrons were compared in a controlled pilot study with conventional megavoltage X-rays (photons). Sixty-three patients entered the study between January, 1973 and July, 1976, 30 patients received neutron and 33 received X-ray therapy. The overall mean survival was 11.4 months for those who received photon and 10 months for those who received neutron therapy.

When the tumor is irradiated by thermal neutrons which selectively interact with the localized nuclide, the ionizing radiation resulting from the reaction dissipates its energy within the tumor and destroys it, leaving normal tissue relatively unharmed. Ten minutes post injection of Boron 10 differential concentration between tumor and normal brain tissue was obtained as reported by Farr (1951). The differential concentration was found to be 3.3:1.

926,"Monte Carlo dosimetry calculation for boron neutron capture therapy in the treatment of brain tumors The pathology of malignant brain tumors often precludes successful treatment by surgery and standard radiation therapy. Boron neutron capture therapy consists of the selective loading of tumor with <sup>10</sup>B and subsequent irradiation with a thermal or epithermal neutron field. The neutron capture reaction <sup>10</sup>B(n,a)<sup>7</sup>Li produces high linear energy transfer charged particles that deposit energy principally within the abnormal tissue that contains a high <sup>10</sup>B concentration. Constraints on this therapy modality are imposed by radiation effects in normal tissue from thermal neutrons, neutron induced gamma rays, fast neutron and gamma ray beam contaminants, and also from the <sup>10</sup>B(n,a)<sup>7</sup>Li reactions in circulating blood. The ANDY general geometry Monte Carlo code is used to calculate the space energy distribution of all pertinent components of the dose within a simple head phantom in an idealized therapy configuration at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research Reactor. The effects of <sup>10</sup>B concentration, gamma ray contamination of the therapy beam, thermal neutron beam aperture, and surgically formed re entrant cavities are examined with respect to several clinical criteria for therapeutic efficacy. It is found for the model considered that the maximum effective relaxation length for the thermal neutron fluence is 1.6 to 1.8 cm, which is 30 to 40% lower than the infinite medium relaxation length, and thereby indicated the importance of multidimensional boundary effects in this calculation. The fluence depth characteristic was verified by an experimental irradiation of a tissue equivalent head phantom with re entrant cavity, and excellent agreement was observed between measured and calculated results. It was also found that the gamma ray beam contaminant is not necessarily deleterious to therapeutic efficacy, that a larger aperture thermal neutron beam improves the dose field with respect to some criteria but at the expense of others, and that plausible size variations in the surgically formed cavity do not change the character of the dose field. As a further refinement, a Monte Carlo microdosimetry model is developed and applied to the problem of radiation effects on the cerebral microvasculature by <sup>10</sup>B capture reactions in the circulating blood.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis is a valid tool to evaluate white matter (WM) integrity. A framework for the integrated analysis of tractographic and dosimetric data in brain tumor patients undergoing radiotherapy is proposed. The tool is able to simultaneously measure in specific white matter tracts the diffusion changes due to microstructural alterations and the radiation dose. Material and Methods Ten consecutive patients affected by high grade glioma were treated by conformal radiotherapy with multiple non-coplanar 6 MV photon beams from a linear accelerator with a total dose of 60 Gy in 30 daily fractions of 2 Gy. Two different time-points were planned for MRI execution (before starting RT and one month after RT). Each MRI study included, beside the DTI, threedimensional T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence (MPRAGE) before and after i.v. injection of contrast medium, as well as FLAIR and TSE-T2W images in the axial plane. The MPRAGE and the TSE-T2W images were coregistered with the b0 image and were used for the delineation of the area of parenchymal distortion (deformed area, DA). The DA included the surgical cavity and/or the area of contrast enhancement and/or the area of abnormal signal on TSE-T2W images. Deterministic fiber tracking across the whole WM was then performed using the fiber assignment continuous tracking algorithm. Fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) maps were generated. A ROI-based approach was used to select the fiber tracts. All fiber tracts passing through the DA were excluded though belonging to one of the three structures considered. The fiber tracts were converted in DICOM-RT format. The MPRAGE sequences without contrast medium were used as reference images for the co-registration with the corresponding planning CT-scan. The RT structure-set files were transferred from the MRI-space into the planning CTspace using the resulting co-registration matrix. Superimposing the dose map from each patient, the dosimetric evaluation was performed. The detailed scheme of our framework is reported in Figure 1. (Figure Presented) Results The DTI analysis was successfully performed pre and post RT. Differences in FA, RD, and AD between pre and post RT MRI were assessed. The superimposition of the fiber tracts maps with the relative information about post treatment alterations on the dosimetric information of the simulation CT was finally obtained. Conclusion We show the feasibility of a standardized tract-based dosimetric analysis, potentially useful to establish possible relations between dose-volumes data and the variation of DTI indices in WM structures.

In one case there was also necrosis of the right frontal lobe with necrosis and inflammation of the bone surrounding the pituitary fossa. In the two other patients, extensive clinical and neuroradiological investigation excluded the presence of a suprasellar mass as a cause for this visual failure and a clinical diagnosis of radiation necrosis was made.",Excluded,0.93824106
754,"Neuroinflammatory changes of the normal brain tissue in cured mice following combined radiation and anti-PD-1 blockade therapy for glioma The efficacy of combining radiation therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitor blockade to treat brain tumors is currently the subject of multiple investigations and holds significant therapeutic promise. However, the long-term effects of this combination therapy on the normal brain tissue are unknown. Here, we examined mice that were intracranially implanted with murine glioma cell line and became long-term survivors after treatment with a combination of 10 Gy cranial irradiation (RT) and anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade (aPD-1). Post-mortem analysis of the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to tumor implantation showed complete abolishment of hippocampal neurogenesis, but neural stem cells were well preserved in subventricular zone. In addition, we observed a drastic reduction in the number of mature oligodendrocytes in the subcortical white matter. Importantly, this observation was evident specifically in the combined (RT+aPD-1) treatment group but not in the single treatment arm of either RT alone or aPD-1 alone. Elimination of microglia with a small molecule inhibitor of colony stimulated factor-1 receptor (PLX5622) prevented the loss of mature oligodendrocytes. These results identify for the first time a unique pattern of normal tissue changes in the brain secondary to combination treatment with radiotherapy and immunotherapy. The results also suggest a role for microglia as key mediators of the adverse treatment effect.",Excluded,0.93769217

972,"The frequency of adverse events by radiation therapy for atomic bomb survivors with cancer Purpose/Objective(s): In Japan, there are many survivors who received ionizing radiation by atomic bomb in 1945. Currently, atomic bomb survivors (ABS) who suffered from cancer are treated as same as usual cancer patients. However, it remains unclear whether the adverse events (AE) of radiation therapy (RT) are increased or not in ABS. To clarify the safety of RT for ABS, we evaluated the frequency of AE by RT in ABS. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively investigated medical records of patients who received curative RT for cancer between 2005 and 2010. We selected the ABS who were officially certified by the Japanese government. AE were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) score Ver.3. One hundred and sixty-five ABS were recruited in this study. Median age was 74 years old (59 to 93) and 96 (58.2%) were men. Median age at the time receiving ionizing radiation by atomic bomb was 11 years old (0 to 32). One hundred and thirty-six ABS (82.4%) were pre-treatment performance status (PS) 0, 21 (12.7%) was PS 1, and 8 (4.8%) were PS 2 or over. Thirty-seven were diagnosed with head and neck, 32 with genitourinary, 29 with breast, 27 with gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary and pancreatic, 23 with lung and mediastinum, and 17 with other cancer. Result(s): One hundred four ABS were definitive irradiation, 48 were postoperative irradiation, and 13 were pre-operative irradiation. Concurrent chemotherapy was performed on 51. Median dose of external RTwas 50 Gy (30 to 78) based on their cancer type. Fifteen patients were performed on stereotactic RT, 12 on intensity-modulated RT, and 11 on brachytherapy. All patients were received standard dose irradiation and completed planned RT. No patients received extended RTover 1 week. Median observation time was 40 months (1 to 84). One hundred fifty-six patients (94.5%) were alive and 9 (5.5%) were dead when at the time investigated. There were no patients who died of AE in the entire course. In acute AE, sixteen patients (9.7%) were classified into grade 3 or above, i.e. one with esophageal mucositis and 15 with hematotoxicity (Grade 3: 11, Grade 4: 4). All these patients received concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Grade 4 or 5 non-hematotoxicitic AE was not identified. In late AE, twelve patients (7.3%) were classified into Grade 3 or above. Four patients were classified into Grade 4, i.e. 3 with myelodysplastic syndrome and 1 with cerebral infarction. Conclusion(s): Notable incensements of AE were not observed during and after RT for ABS. This study clarified that standard dose RT prescription can be administered safely to ABS with cancer even though they received ionizing radiation by atomic bomb before half century.",Excluded,0.93593806

150,"Effect of microradiosurgical transections upon kainate seizure focus Multiple subpial transections (MST) sever horizontal intracortical fibers involved in the propagation of seizures, while preserving vertical fibers which are essential for brain function. Less damaging to the brain than a traditional resection,MST still exposes patients to the risks of craniotomy. Microradiosurgery uses synchrotron generated sub-millimetric beams of radiation. Arrays of tightly spaced microbeams produce a lethal effect only to those cells directly in the beam path. Low energy x-rays used for microradiosurgery have a small tissue half-value layer making the technique ideal for treating superficial brain lesions. Video-EEG (VEEG) data was recorded immediately following kainate injected into sensorimotor cortex. Rats then underwent irradiation with an array of parallel microbeams delivered to the seizure focus.Subclinical electrographic ictal events remained frequent up to 10 hours post irradiation. More prolonged seizures exhibited typical rat complex partial seizure semiologies. These results demonstrate the feasibility of recording VEEG before and after precise microbeam irradiation from a synchrotron source; demonstrating a methodology which will be useful for future experiments serving to optimize microbeam doses and configuration in preparation for the treatment of epilepsy in humans. The results show some promise that microradiosurgical MST can limit the spread of seizures without causing clinically evident neurological damage.",Excluded,0.9354948

As exogenous stimuli, arginine, TRH, LH-RH and L-dopa were administered. In 2 out of 3 patients treated with Liniac irradiation, the responsiveness to arginine was essentially unchanged, while in the third patient positive response to arginine disappeared after therapy. Of 2 patients who received a combination of hypophysectomy and Liniac irradiation, the responsiveness to arginine, TRH, LH-RH and L-dopa did not change in 1 patient, but in the other it was observed that negative response to L-dopa became positive after the treatment, remaining the unchanged responsiveness to arginine, TRH, and LH-RH. In 3 hypophysectomized patients, little change in responses to the above 4 stimuli was observed. In summary, out of 22 pairs of responses (pre- and post-therapy) examined 20 were not altered. In 11 pairs of responses (pre- and post-irradiation) particularly, 10 were essentially unchanged.

63,"Effect of short-duration spaceflight on thigh and leg muscle volume PURPOSE: Human skeletal muscle probably atrophies as a result of spaceflight, but few studies have examined this issue. Thus, little is known about the influence of microgravity upon human skeletal muscle, nor is it possible to assess the validity of ground based models of spaceflight. This study tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of spaceflight induced muscle atrophy would be a function of flight duration and greater than that of bed rest.METHODS: Three astronauts flew 9, 15, and 16 d in space. Volume of the knee extensor (quadriceps femoris), knee flexor (hamstrings, sartorius, and gracilis), and plantar flexor (triceps surae) muscle groups was measured using magnetic resonance imaging before and after spaceflight and during recovery. The volume of each muscle group in each image was determined by multiplying cross-sectional area by slice thickness. These values were subsequently summed to calculate muscle volume.RESULTS: Volume changes in the knee extensor, knee flexor, and plantar flexor muscle groups ranged from -15.4 to -5.5, -14.1 to -5.6, and -8.8 to -15.9%, respectively. Muscle volume decreases normalized by flight duration ranged from 0.62 to 1.04% x d(-1). These relative changes appeared to be greater than those that we have reported previously for bed rest (Akima et al., J. Gravitat. Physiol. 4:15-22, 1997).CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that atrophy as a result of at least 2 wk of spaceflight varied among individuals and muscle groups and that the degree of atrophy appeared to be greater than that induced by 20 d of bed rest.",Excluded,0.9332092
177,"Comparative human cellular radiosensitivity: I. The effect of SV40 transformation and immortalisation on the gamma-irradiation survival of skin derived fibroblasts from normal individuals and from ataxia-telangiectasia patients and heterozygotes We have compared cell killing following 60Co gamma irradiation in 22 primary human fibroblast strains, nine SV40-immortalized human fibroblast lines and seven SV40-transformed pre-crisis human fibroblast cultures. We have examined material from normal individuals, from ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients and from A-T heterozygotes. We have confirmed the greater sensitivity of A-T derived cells to gamma radiation. The distinction between A-T and normal cells is maintained in cells immortalized by SV40 virus but the immortal cells are more gamma radiation resistant than the corresponding primary fibroblasts. Cells transformed by plasmids (pSV3gpt and pSV3neo) expressing SV40 T-antigen, both pre- and post-crisis, show this increased resistance, indicating that it is expression of SV40 T-antigen, rather than immortalization per se which is responsible for the change. We use D0, obtained from a straight line fit, and D, estimated from a multitarget curve, as parameters to compare radiosensitivity. We suggest that both have their advantages; D0 is perhaps more reproducible, but D is more realistic when comparing shouldered and non-shouldered data.",Excluded,0.9327055

High doses of ionizing radiation is the only established exogenous risk factor. To explore new potential biological risk factors for glioblastoma, we investigated alterations in metabolite concentrations in pre-diagnosed serum samples from glioblastoma patients diagnosed up to 22 years after sample collection, and undiseased controls. The study points out a latent biomarker for future glioblastoma consisting of nine metabolites (gamma-tocopherol, alpha-tocopherol, erythritol, erythronic acid, myo-inositol, cystine, 2-keto-L-gluconic acid, hypoxanthine and xanthine) involved in antioxidant metabolism. We detected significantly higher serum concentrations of alpha-tocopherol (p=0.0018) and gamma-tocopherol (p=0.0009) in future glioblastoma cases. Compared to their matched controls, the cases showed a significant average fold increase of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol levels: 1.2 for alpha-T (p=0.018) and 1.6 for gamma-T (p=0.003). These tocopherol levels were associated with a glioblastoma odds ratio of 1.7 (alpha-T, 95% CI:1.0-3.0) and 2.1 (gamma-T, 95% CI:1.2-3.8).

As a preparatory study, we conducted in-depth interviews with gynecological cancer survivors and constructed a study-specific questionnaire which we validated face-to-face. The questionnaire covered physical symptoms originating in the pelvis, demographic, psychological, and quality of life factors. In relation to the lymph system, 19 questions were asked.RESULTS: Six hundred sixteen (78 %) gynecological cancer survivors answered the questionnaire and participated in the study. Thirty-six percent (218/606) of the cancer survivors reported LLL. Overall quality of life was significantly lower among cancer survivors with LLL. They were also less satisfied with their sleep, more worried about recurrence of cancer, and more likely to interpret symptoms from the body as recurrence. Cancer survivors reported that LLL kept them from physical activity (45 %) and house work (29 %) and affected their ability to partake in social activities (27 %) or to meet friends (20 %).CONCLUSION: Lower limb lymphedema has a negative impact on quality of life among gynecological cancer survivors, affecting sleep and daily life activities, yet only a few seek professional help.",Excluded,0.93172914

608,"Low-dose radiation hypersensitivity in human tumor cell lines: effects of cell-cell contact and nutritional deprivation The hyper-radiosensitivity at low doses recently observed in vitro in a number of cell lines is thought to have important implications for improving tumor radiotherapy. However, cell-cell contact and the cellular environment influence cellular radiosensitivity at higher doses, and they may alter hyper-radiosensitivity in vivo. To confirm this supposition, we investigated the effects of cell density, multiplicity and nutritional deprivation on low-dose hypersensitivity in vitro. Cell survival in the low-dose range (3 cGy to 2 Gy) was studied in cells of two human glioma (BMG-1 and U-87) and two human oral squamous carcinoma (PECA-4451 and PECA-4197) lines using a conventional macrocolony assay. The effects of cell density, multiplicity and nutritional deprivation on hyper-radiosensitivity/induced radioresistance were studied in cells of the BMG-1 cell line, which showed prominent hypersensitivity and induced radioresistance. The induction of growth inhibition, cell cycle delay, micronuclei and apoptosis was also studied at the hyper-radiosensitivity-inducing low doses. Hyper-radiosensitivity/induced radioresistance was evident in the cells of all four cell lines to varying extents, with maximum sensitivity at 10-30 cGy, followed by an increase in survival up to 50 cGy-1 Gy. Both the glioma cell lines had more prominent hyper-radiosensitivity than the two squamous carcinoma cell lines. Low doses inducing maximum hyper-radiosensitivity did not cause significant growth inhibition, micronucleation or apoptosis in BMG-1 cells, but a transient G(1)/S-phase block was evident. Irradiating and incubating BMG-1 cells at high density for 0 or 4 h before plating, as well as irradiating cells as microcolonies, reduced hyper-radiosensitivity significantly, indicating the role of cell-cell contact-mediated processes. Liquid holding of BMG-1 cells in HBSS + 1% serum during and after irradiation for 4 h significantly reduced hyper-radiosensitivity, suggesting that hyper-radiosensitivity may be due partly to active damage fixation processes at low doses. Therefore, our findings suggest that the damage-induced signaling mechanisms influenced by (or mediated through) cell-cell contact or the cellular environment, as well as the lesion fixation processes, play an important role in hyper-radiosensitivity. Further studies are required to determine the exact nature of the damage that triggers these responses as well as for evaluating the potential of low-dose therapy.",Excluded,0.930484

65,"Models of bystander signalling between primary astrocytes and glioma cells: Effects on survival and migration/invasion INTRODUCTION: The goal of radiotherapy is to cause cell death in the targeted tumour field and minimize toxicity to the surrounding normal tissue. However, malignant gliomas are highly resistant to ionizing radiation (IR). Recent data suggest migration/invasion is up-regulated as a counterproductive effect of IR. In addition to direct IR effects, non-targeted radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBE), observed beyond the targeted field, can cause significant cell death of the tumour and surrounding normal tissues. Little is known of how RIBE modulates glioma migration/invasion. METHOD(S): RIBE of 10 astrocytes and glioma cells grown as single and cocultures in 2D (monolayer) and 3D matrices was investigated, using media transferred from irradiated cultures and in half-exposed/shielded cultures. Nuclear 53BP1 foci were used as a surrogateDNA damage marker and transwell assays to quantitate migration/invasion. Two3D models were developed to study gliospheres in: (i) collagen matrices with/without astrocytes and (ii) mouse brain slice cultures. RESULT(S): RIBE signals from IR and non-IR glioma cultures both decreased astrocyte clonogenic survival.Weobserved increased DNA damage in astrocyte and glioma bystander cells in 2D and 3D cultures. Bystander cells had increased p38-MAPK, Connexin 43, and COX-2signalling. Direct IR induced an increase and RIBE a decrease in transwell migration. Experiments of gliosphere migration/invasion in 3D models are underway. CONCLUSION(S): These results may have implications for tumour-normal tissue margin interactions. By comparing differential molecular factors involved in the RIBE, we aim to find targets to enhance glioma cell death and inhibit migration/invasion, while preserving normal tissue.",Excluded,0.92875755

230,"MMP-2 siRNA inhibits radiation-enhanced invasiveness in glioma cells BACKGROUND: Our previous work and that of others strongly suggests a relationship between the infiltrative phenotype of gliomas and the expression of MMP-2. Radiation therapy, which represents one of the mainstays of glioma treatment, is known to increase cell invasion by inducing MMP-2. Thus, inhibition of MMP-2 provides a potential means for improving the efficacy of radiotherapy for malignant glioma.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have tested the ability of a plasmid vector-mediated MMP-2 siRNA (p-MMP-2) to modulate ionizing radiation-induced invasive phenotype in the human glioma cell lines U251 and U87. Cells that were transfected with p-MMP-2 with and without radiation showed a marked reduction of MMP-2 compared to controls and pSV-transfected cells. A significant reduction of proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis of cells transfected with p-MMP-2 and in combination with radiation was observed compared to controls. Western blot analysis revealed that radiation-enhanced levels of VEGF, VEGFR-2, pVEGFR-2, p-FAK, and p-p38 were inhibited with p-MMP-2-transfected cells. TUNEL staining showed that radiation did not induce apoptosis in U87 and U251 cells while a significant increase in TUNEL-positive cells was observed when irradiated cells were simultaneously transfected with p-MMP-2 as compared to controls. Intracranial tumor growth was predominantly inhibited in the animals treated with p-MMP-2 alone or in combination with radiation compared to controls.CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: MMP-2 inhibition, mediated by p-MMP-2 and in combination with radiation, significantly reduced tumor cell migration, invasion, angiogenesis and tumor growth by modulating several important downstream signaling molecules and directing cells towards apoptosis. Taken together, our results demonstrate the efficacy of p-MMP-2 in inhibiting radiation-enhanced tumor invasion and progression and suggest that it may act as a potent adjuvant for radiotherapy in glioma patients.",Excluded,0.92651504

Data on histopathological changes, particularly after salvage SBRT (sSBRT) following conventional irradiation, are scarce.OBJECTIVE: To investigate surgical specimens after sSBRT and primary SBRT (pSBRT) regarding histopathological changes.METHODS: We assessed 704 patients treated with spine SBRT 2006 to 2012. Thirty patients underwent salvage surgery; 23 histopathological reports were available. Clinical and histopathological findings were analyzed for sSBRT (69.6%) and pSBRT (30.4%).RESULTS: Mean time to surgery after sSBRT/pSBRT was 8.3/10.3 mo (P = .64). Reason for surgery included pain (sSBRT/pSBRT: 12.5%/71.4%, P = .25), fractures (sSBRT/pSBRT: 37.5%/28.6%, P = .68), and neurological symptoms (sSBRT/pSBRT: 68.8%/42.9%, P = .24). Radiological tumor progression after sSBRT/pSBRT was seen in 71.4%/42.9% (P = .2). Most specimens displayed viable/proliferative tumor (sSBRT/pSBRT: 62.5%/71.4%, P = .68 and 56.3%/57.1%, P = .97). Few specimens showed soft tissue necrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 20%/28.6%, P = .66), osteonecrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 14.3%/16.7%, P = .89), or bone marrow fibrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 42.9%/33.3%, P = .69). Tumor bed necrosis was more common after sSBRT (81.3%/42.9%, P = .066). Radiological tumor progression correlated with viable/proliferative tumor (P = .03/P = .006) and tumor bed necrosis (P = .03). Fractures were increased with bone marrow fibrosis (P = .07), but not with osteonecrosis (P = .53) or soft tissue necrosis (P = .19).

Given the potentially debilitating consequences of depression, and the fact that TBI patients are frequently refractory to antidepressant drugs, new therapies are clearly needed. We hypothesized that human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), delivered intravenously, can effectively treat TBI-induced depression and other behavioral deficits associated with TBI.METHODS: Rats (n = 8 per group) were subjected to experimental TBI or control sham operation. Six hours post TBI, rats were treated with 1x106 hMSC or vehicle control. Immediately after TBI and prior to hMSC or control treatment, rats were subjected to either targeted precision x-ray irradiation to eliminate subventricular zone (SVZ) proliferation or sham irradiation. One week after TBI, SVZ irradiation, and hMSC treatment, rats were evaluated for the depression-like behavior, anhedonia, using the two-bottle saccharin preference paradigm; and for working memory using the novel object recognition test.RESULTS: TBI resulted in a 54% (p<=0.05) decrease in saccharin preference scores while treatment of TBI with hMSC fully prevented this anhedonic behavior. TBI was also found to produce a 73% (p<=0.05) decrease in novel object interaction time, indicating impaired working memory, and was similarly improved by treatment with hMSC. The ability of hMSC to prevent TBI-associated depression and working memory impairment was eliminated when SVZ proliferation was inhibited by irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: This work has identified a possible role for hMSC in the treatment of TBI-induced depression and other behaviors and suggests a mechanistic role for proliferative cells of the SVZ proliferation in hMSC efficacy.",Excluded,0.9248211

We based the exposure assessment on measurements from 1,015 different workplaces. On the basis of the job held longest during the 10-year period before diagnosis, we found an association between the average, daily, mean level of EMF and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The risk increased with increasing level of exposure. The odds ratios (OR) and the 95 percent confidence interval (CI) for three consecutive levels of exposure were: 1.1 (CI = 0.5-2.3); 2.2 (CI = 1.1-4.3); 3.0 (CI = 1.6-5.8), respectively. No association was observed for acute myeloid leukemia (OR = 1.0, CI = 0.5-1.8; OR = 0.8, CI = 0.4-1.6; OR = 1.0, CI = 0.6-1.9). For brain tumors, the corresponding risk estimates were 1.0 (CI = 0.7-1.6); 1.5 (CI = 1.0-2.2); 1.4 (CI = 0.9-2.1). Different EMF indices were tested. Tasks with frequent or large variations between high and low field-densities (high standard deviation) were more common among CLL subjects. For brain tumors, a prolonged high level (high median values) showed the strongest association. Confounding by place of residence, smoking, benzene, ionizing radiation, pesticides, and solvents was evaluated, and these factors did not seem to have a decisive influence on the associations. We also analyzed other potential sources of bias. For CLL, there were indications of an excess number of low-exposure subjects among non-responders, which, to some extent, may have enhanced but not caused the risk estimates obtained.

Determination of the timing and dose of radiation therapy required the assessment of the duration of the effect of wtp53 expression on 9L tumors after in vivo transfection. Methods. Anesthetized male F-344 rats each were stereotactically inoculated with 4 x 10<sup>4</sup> 9L gliosarcoma cells through a skull screw into the cerebrum in the right frontal region. Twelve-day-old tumors were inoculated through the screw with recombinant adenoviral vectors under isoflurane anaesthesia: control rats with Ad5/RSV/GL2 (carrying the luciferase gene), and study rats with Ad5CMV-p53 (carrying the wtp53 gene). Brain tumors removed at specific times after transfection were measured, homogenized, and lysed and wtp53 expression determined by Western blot analysis. Four groups of nine rats were, subsequently, implanted with iodine-125 seeds 15 days post-tumor inoculation to give a minimum tumor dose of 40 or 60 Gy. Results. We demonstrated transfer of wtp53 into rat 9L tumors in vivo using the Ad5CMV-p53 vector. The expression of wtp53 was demonstrated to be maximum between days 1 and 3 post-vector inoculation. Tumors expressing wtp53 were smaller than controls transfected with Ad5/RSV/GL2 but this difference was not statistically significant. Radiation made a significant difference to the survival of tumor-bearing rats. Moreover, wtp53 expression conferred a significant additional survival advantage. Conclusion.

Seventy-two rats were used in six independent experiments, three of which were done with 900 MHz and the other three with 1800 MHz. The exposures were performed in a gigahertz transverse electromagnetic mode (GTEM) cell. The power densities of radiation were 100 and 20 microW/cm(2) at 900 and 1800 MHz frequency, respectively. The carrier frequency was modulated with 218 Hz, as in the GSM signal. The animals were exposed for 2 h between 8:00 AM and noon daily during the 14 day exposure period. The urine of rats was collected from 12:00 AM to 8:00 AM, collecting from exposed and control animal groups on alternate days. The urinary 6SM concentration was measured by (125)I radioimmunoassay and was referred to creatinine. The combined results of three experiments done with the same frequency were statistically analyzed. Statistically significant changes in the 6SM excretion of exposed rats (n = 18) compared to control group (n = 18) were not found either at 900 or 1800 MHz.",Excluded,0.9220779
1130,"Light seeing in radiotherapy of patients with brain tumours and head and neck malignancies Purpose or Objective: Evaluating the radiation doses delivered to different parts of the visual pathway for better understanding of light vision in radiotherapy patients. Material(s) and Method(s): 20 patients with brain tumors and head and neck malignancies who received radiotherapy and experienced any kind of light or color vision during radiation treatment. All the components of visual pathway including lenses, eyeballs, retinas, optic nerves, chiasm, optic tracts, optic radiations and visual occipital cortexes were contoured. Result(s): 11 patients were male (55%) and 9 were female (45%). Age median was 56 years. The range of dose/fraction and total prescribed dose were 1.8-3 Gy and 36-70.4 Gy respectively. Twelve patients reported white, 11, blue, 2, yellow and 2, gray color visions. Seven patients experienced more than one color, while 2 patients did not attribute any special color to their light seeing experiences. Four patients had a kind of smell experience and 1 patient had a taste experience. Conclusion(s): Cherenkov radiation in eye ballsmay be the origin of light seeing experiences in patients receiving radiation treatment for head and neck malignancies, since treatmentsareperformed with ionizing radiations with energycapable to produce this effect. Also this effectmay be due to phosphenes produced by radiation treatment in different parts of the visual pathway (from retina to visual cortex). In order to investigate the mechanism of this phenomenon in patients and to define a radiation dose threshold - if the origin of this phenomenon is phosphenes produced in visual pathway - larger studies are needed.",Excluded,0.9220216
110,"Neurotransmitter receptor expression by peripheral mononuclear cells: possible marker of neuronal damage by exposure to radiations Peripheral mononuclear cells (PMC) express several neurotransmitter systems. Increasing evidence suggests that PMC neurotransmitter receptors are involved in modulating immune responses. It is also thought that expression of PMC neurotransmitter receptors may reflect the status of homologous brain receptors. A problem encountered with assay of PMC neurotransmitter receptors was in developing techniques suitable for their assessment in spite of low density. In this paper we summarized findings on the expression of alpha1-adrenoceptor and dopamine receptor subtypes in human peripheral blood lymphocytes characterized by radioligand binding assay techniques and immunocytochemistry. Human lymphocytes express alpha1A-, alpha1B- and alpha1D-adrenoceptor subtypes and dopamine D3, D4 and D5 receptors. Compared to radioligand binding assay, immunocytochemistry applied to cytospin-centrifuged peripheral lymphocytes allowed to assay receptor subtypes investigated in small amounts of blood. The development of sensitive and reproducible techniques for assaying PMC neurotransmitter receptor subtypes even in small amounts of blood such as those used for diagnostic purposes may allow to analyze their sensitivity to different conditions including radiation exposure.",Excluded,0.9218006

Thirty-nine patients with encephalic and spinal meningiomas assumed from MRI findings were recruited and received high-dose hypofractionated volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy by a linear accelerator equipped with an external beam modulator micro-multileaf collimator and an XVI cone beam computed tomography system. The prescribed mean dose was 33 Gy in five fractions. The treatment feasibility was tested through planned and delivered dose agreement checks. Regular clinical examinations were performed during and after irradiation time, with regard to mentation, deambulation, cranial nerve dysfunction, and seizures. Serial MRI exams were done 60 days after irradiation and after 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo. Volumetric disease reduction criteria implemented with clinical neurological systematic evaluation were adopted to assess the course and to categorize patients' responses. Complete and partial responses were observed on the whole in 65.5% of alive patients 24 mo after irradiation. Two-yr overall and disease-specific survival rates were 74.3% and 97.4%, respectively, and the putative radiotoxic effects were found to be few and slight.

375,"[Effects of parabolic flight on redox status in SH-SY5Y cells] Space flight is known to produce a number of neurological disturbances. The etiology is unknown, but it may involve increased oxidative stress. A line of experimental evidence indicates that space flight may disrupt antioxidant defense system and result in increased oxidative stress. In vitro studies found that abundant of NO was produced in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and protein nitration was increased in PC12 cells within a simulated microgravity rotating wall bioreactor high aspect ratio vessel system or clinostat system. In the present study, we observed the change of redox status in SH-SY5Y cells after parabolic flight, and studied the effects of key redox molecule, thioredoxin (TRX), during the altered gravity. SH-SY5Y cells were divided into four groups: control cells, control cells transfected with TRX, flight cells and flight cells transfected with TRX. The expression levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TRX and thioredoxin reductase (TRXR) were observed by immunocytochemical method. It was shown that after parabolic flight, the staining of 3-NT and TRX were enhanced, while the expression level of TRXR was down-regulated compared with control. As for flight cells transfected with TRX, the staining of 3-NT and iNOS were weakened compared with flight cells. These results obtained suggest that altered gravity may increase protein nitration, down-regulate TRXR and elicit oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells, while TRX transfection could partly protect cells against oxidative stress induced by parabolic flight.",Excluded,0.9191983

125,"Prevalence, predictors, and characteristics of off-treatment fatigue in breast cancer survivors BACKGROUND: Lack of consensus regarding how to identify cancer patients with significant fatigue has hampered research regarding cancer-related fatigue (CRF).METHODS: Specific criteria were used to identify CRF cases in women with stage 0-II breast cancer (BC group, n = 304). Women completed assessments before adjuvant therapy (baseline), end of adjuvant therapy (Post-Tx), and 6 and 42 months after end of adjuvant therapy (6 and 42 Month Post-Tx). At each, women completed a clinical interview and questionnaires assessing physical and mental health. A healthy control (HC) group with no history of BC (n = 337) completed 2 similar assessments 36 months apart.RESULTS: Off-treatment CRF prevalence was 9% and 13% at the 6 and 42 Month Post-Tx assessments, respectively. Thus, 15% of the sample evidenced off-treatment CRF with 7% evidencing delayed onset CRF. CRF at the 6 Month Post-Tx assessment was associated only with CRF at baseline (OR = 3.2) and Post-Tx assessments (OR = 3.9). CRF at the 42 Month Post-Tx assessment was associated with CRF at the Post-Tx assessment (OR = 6.1), obesity at baseline, and several baseline measures of coping in response to fatigue. Off-treatment CRF cases differed markedly from CRF noncases and healthy controls on a spectrum of health status indices (mean effect size >1.0 SD).CONCLUSIONS: Results document the prevalence of off-treatment and delayed onset CRF, suggest the utility of a cognitive-behavioral model of CRF, and support NCCN guidelines recommending monitoring fatigue across the cancer trajectory.",Excluded,0.91748136

All patients underwent phonatory rehabilitation with voice prosthesis, along with evidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease, for which proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were prescribed. We analyzed the occurrence of fistula-related problems among patients who received postoperative radiotherapy and those patients who did not.RESULTS: We observed a higher rate of failure of speech rehabilitation in laryngectomy patients with gastroesphageal reflux: this occurred when they had a history of postoperative radiotherapy (45%) compared with patients who did not (17%) (P < 0.05), although all patients were treated with PPIs.CONCLUSION: Our results seem to confirm the importance of postoperative radiotherapy with gastroesophageal reflux for the determinism of fistula-related problems.",Excluded,0.9160458
169,"Radiation-Induced Optic Neuropathy: Clinical and Imaging Profile of Twelve Patients BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RON) is a form of delayed radionecrosis of the anterior visual pathways, which develops within months to years after external cranial irradiation and causes severe and irreversible vision loss. Small series reports have adequately documented its clinical features, but imaging characteristics have been less completely described.METHODS: We accrued cases from the University of Michigan Neuro-Ophthalmology Clinic files and from cases coded as ""radiation optic neuropathy"" at the University of Michigan Medical Center between 1994 and 2017. All patients had undergone 3D-conformal linear accelerator (photon) external beam radiation. We collected clinical details of vision loss, including the temporal relationship to radiation. A single neuroradiologist (E.A.L.) evaluated all available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, noting the presence of enhancement, expansion, or volume loss of the optic nerves or chiasm, corresponding T2 signal abnormalities, and the absence of demyelination or confounding compressive lesions.RESULTS: Twelve patients (15 eyes) met inclusion criteria. Vision loss was usually monocular at outset, but both optic nerves were eventually involved in 3 (25%) patients. Although usually sudden in onset, vision loss often declined slowly over many months, frequently to finger counting, or worse without recovery. An afferent pupillary defect was always present at the time of presentation. Most affected optic discs were pale at the time of first visual symptoms, indicating that subclinical optic nerve damage had been present for several weeks. The latency from completion of radiation to onset of vision loss ranged from 7 to 48 months (average: 18 months). In 2 patients, radiation was delivered to the whole brain, rather than being limited to the anterior visual pathway. MRI typically displayed a discrete region of enhancement of the affected prechiasmatic optic nerve, often with expansion and high T2 signal in the enhancing segment. In 3 affected eyes, enhancement was apparent on imaging completed 3-6 weeks before the onset of vision loss. In one patient, segmental prechiasmatic enhancement became evident only on repeat MRI completed 7 months after vision loss. The duration of enhancement among 9 eyes with follow-up MRIs was at least 2 months, but in one case, enhancement was still present on a study performed 17 months after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: This study further delineates the profile of RON. Visual loss is often acute, profound, and monocular but may decline slowly after acute onset and later affect both optic nerves. High-resolution MRI of the optic nerves usually will display enhancement of a discrete segment of the intracranial prechiasmatic optic nerve, often with accompanying expansion and T2 hyperintensity. In some cases, these imaging features may precede vision loss. They may be subtle or appear after vision loss. Enhancement lingers for a wide interval, ranging in this study from 2 to at least 17 months. Recognition of these imaging characteristics assists in confirmation of the diagnosis of RON.",Excluded,0.91544443

Clinically significant radiation necrosis (RN) was defined as symptomatic RN or asymptomatic RN that resulted in surgery or bevacizumab administration. The cumulative incidence was calculated using competing risks. Risk factors were identified using Cox proportional hazards.RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 28.5 months, cRN developed in 18 patients (proton, 6; photon, 12). The 2-year cumulative incidence of cRN for proton and photon therapy was 18.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.5%-33.8%) and 9.7% (95% CI, 5.1%-16%), respectively (P = .16). On multivariate analysis, risk factors for cRN included oligodendroglioma (hazard ratio [HR], 3.57; 95% CI, 1.38-9.25; P = .009) and higher prescription dose (in gray relative biological equivalents [GyRBE]) (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.61; P = .015). The 2-year cumulative incidence of cRN in oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas was 24.2% and 6.2%, respectively (P = .01). The relative volume (percentage) of brain receiving 60 GyRBE was a significant dosimetric predictor of cRN in oligodendrogliomas (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.20; P = .005).CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that 1p/19q codeleted oligodendroglioma was a significant risk factor associated with cRN and the relative volume (percentage) of brain receiving 60 GyRBE was an important dosimetric predictor of cRN for oligodendroglioma patients. There is insufficient evidence at this time to conclude a significant difference in the incidence of cRN between proton and photon therapy.",Excluded,0.9124638

Aim 1 - To provide 3 year results for the longitudinal study. Aim 2 - To improve the questionnaire used to collect data by identifying redundant items and modifying for use to collect Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) data.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Aim 1 - Patient reported outcome data were collected prospectively by 226 patients before and up to 3 years following radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer using a questionnaire developed to collect LENT subjective data. Aim 2 - A factor analysis was performed to identify which questions gave the most and least information.RESULTS: Aim 1 - Faecal urgency and incontinence (all grades) peaked at 79% and 24%, respectively at 1 year then settled to 69% and 18% at 3 years, respectively. Urinary urgency (all grades) increased with time and was described in 75% at 3 years. Other symptoms reported at 3 years include diarrhoea in 12%, urinary incontinence in 27% and vaginal dryness in 29%. A third of patients did not feel their sex life had changed following treatment, while a quarter felt that it had. Aim 2 - some questions overlapped and others were non-specific.

All patients had been totally or partially refractory to prolonged oral treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, and most had contra-indications for these drugs. Low-dose (1.8- to 2.3-Gy total dose) TBI was administered in single, 0.1-Gy doses, two to three times per week. TBI was well tolerated and was associated with objective clinical improvement in six patients, lasting more than 2 years in five. In addition, TBI produced a long-lasting lymphopenia with a pronounced decrease of T CD4+ lymphocytes; T CD8+ lymphocytes were almost unchanged over the 2 years of the study. CD16+ and CD20+ lymphocytes, after an initial decrease, increased above baseline. TBI was also associated with decreased anti-AChR antibody titer. The decrease of lymphocyte count and of anti-AChR antibody titer was more pronounced in the patients who improved, suggesting that lymphopenia and immunosuppression may have contributed to clinical improvement.",Excluded,0.9095254

There is concern for higher rates of pseudoprogression (PsP) after protons compared to photons. The purposes of this study are to compare the rate of PsP after proton vs. photon therapy for grade II and III gliomas and to identify factors associated with the development of PsP. Material(s) and Method(s): Ninety-nine patients age >18 years with grade II or III glioma treated with photons or protons were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, IDH and 1p19q status, and treatment factors were analyzed for association with PsP, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Sixty-five patients were treated with photons and 34 with protons. Among those with oligodendroglioma, PsP developed in 6/42 photon-treated patients (14.3%) and 4/25 proton-treated patients (16%, p = 1.00). Among those with astrocytoma, PsP developed in 3/23 photon-treated patients (13%) and 1/9 proton-treated patients (11.1%, p = 1.00). There was no difference in PsP rate based on radiation type, radiation dose, tumor grade, 1p19q codeletion, or IDH status. PsP occurred earlier in oligodendroglioma patients treated with protons compared to photons, 48 days vs. 131 days, p <.01.

In patients with deep-seated lesions or those located in critical sites of the brain, as well as in cases in which the patient's general condition makes general anaesthesia difficult or impossible microsurgical resection usually cannot be performed or only with an increased surgical risk. Stereotactic radiosurgery, which can be done by means of convergent beam irradiation or by the implantation of highly loaded 125I seeds, provides an alternative to open procedures. In the following we report on our results using a stereotactic radiosurgical technique. A series of 20 treatments is presented, in which biopsy was performed and 125I seeds were implanted, both under stereotactic conditions in the same session. The 125I seeds were sealed in a teflon catheter, were left indwelling temporarily, and then removed after application of the prescribed radiation dose (6,000cGy at the tumour margin). There was only one recurrence in our series, complications occurred in only one patient by temporary aggravation of a pre-existing hemiparesis. Our results indicate that interstitial irradiation of brain metastases is a valuable, less stressful alternative to both open microsurgery as well as to stereotactic radiosurgical convergent beam irradiation.",Excluded,0.9016124

For patients treated with implant alone, the prostate and margin (clinical target volume [CTV]) received a prescription dose of 144 Gy for I-125 or 115 Gy for Pd-103. Two patients received Pd-103 (90 Gy) with 46 Gy supplemental external beam radiation (EBRT). Axial CT images were acquired 2 to 4 hours postoperatively for postimplant dosimetry. Because the NVBs cannot be visualized on CT, NVB calculation points were determined according to previously published anatomic descriptions. Bilateral NVB points were considered to lie posterior-laterally, approximately 2 mm from the prostatic capsule. NVB doses were recorded bilaterally, at 0.5-cm intervals from the prostatic base.RESULTS: For Pd-103, the average NVB doses ranged from 150 Gy to 260 Gy, or 130% to 226% of the prescription dose. For I-125, the average NVB dose ranged from 200 Gy to 325 Gy, or 140% to 225% of the prescription dose. These was no consistent relationship between the NVB dose and the distance from the prostatic base. To examine the possible effect of minor deviations of our calculation points from the true NVB location, we performed NVB calculations at points 2 mm medial or lateral from the NVB calculation point in 8 patients. Doses at these alternate calculation points were comparable, although there was greater variability with small changes in the calculation point if sources were located outside the capsule, near the NVB calculation point. Three patients who developed early postimplant impotence had maximal NVB doses that far exceeded the average values.CONCLUSIONS: In the next few years, we hope to clarify the role of high NVB radiation doses on potency, by correlating NVB dose calculations with a large number of patients enrolled in an ongoing I-125 versus Pd-103 trial for early-stage patients, for whom detailed dosimetric and potency data are being collected prospectively. In the future, we anticipate that NVB doses may be incorporated into dosimetry guidelines to maximize tumor control and minimize treatment-related morbidity.",Excluded,0.8980475

Radiotherapy (RT) often induces side effects that significantly influence patients' quality of life (QoL), with potential impact on survival. We evaluated distress, anxiety, depression, and QoL over time to identify patients with difficulties in these areas who required more intense psychological support.METHODS: Psychological questionnaires-Distress Thermometer (DT), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G and FACT-Br)-were completed at the beginning (T0), in the middle (T1), directly after RT (T2), and 3 months after RT (T3). We personalised the psychological support provided for each patient with a minimum of three sessions ('typical' schedule) and a maximum of eight sessions ('intensive' schedule), depending on the patients' psychological profiles, clinical evaluations, and requests. Patients' survival was evaluated in the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients, with an explorative intent.RESULTS: Fifty-nine consecutive PMBT patients receiving post-operative RT were included. For patients who were reported as 'not distressed' at T0, no statistically significant changes were noted. In contrast, patients who were 'distressed' at T0 showed statistically significant improvements in DT, HADS, FACT-G, and FACT-Br scores over time. 'Not distressed' patients required less psychological sessions over the study duration than 'distressed' patients. Interestingly, 'not distressed' GBM patients survived longer than 'distressed' GBM patients.CONCLUSIONS: Increased psychological support improved distress, mood, and QoL for patients identified as 'distressed', whereas psychological well-being was maintained with typical psychological support in patients who were identified as being 'not distressed'.

The overall cumulative incidences of stroke, TIA, DVT, and PE at 10 years were 6.0, 3.0, 3.4, and 1.9%, respectively. In the multivariable competing risks model, there was a significant association between ADT and stroke (subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.09-1.30, p < 0.01), TIA (SHR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.08-1.41, p < 0.01), and DVT (SHR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.04-1.34, p < 0.01). ADT was only associated with PE in men receiving ADT for > 1 year (SHR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.06-1.69, p-value = 0.03).CONCLUSION: We observed an increase in the risk of stroke, TIA, and DVT in men receiving ADT and an increased risk of PE in men receiving long-term ADT. These results highlight concerns regarding long-term risks of ADT on stroke and thromboembolic events in the treatment of PC.",Excluded,0.8963412
1187,"Lower doses to hippocampi and other brain structures for skull-base meningiomas with intensity modulated proton therapy compared to photon therapy BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiotherapy of skull-base meningiomas is challenging due to the close proximity of multiple sensitive organs at risk (OARs). This study systematically compared intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT), non-coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) based on automated treatment planning. Differences in OARs sparing, with specific focus on the hippocampi, and low-dose delivery were quantified.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients, target diameter >3cm, were included. Automated plan generation was used to calculate a VMAT plan with three non-coplanar arcs, an IMRT plan with nine non-coplanar beams with optimized gantry and couch angles, and an IMPT plan with three patient-specific selected non-coplanar beams. A prescription dose of 50.4 GyRBE in 28 fractions was used. The same set of constraints and prioritized objectives was used. All plans were rescaled to the same target coverage. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess the statistical significance of differences in OAR dose parameters between planning techniques.RESULTS: Compared to VMAT and IMRT, IMPT significantly improved dose conformity to the target volume. Consequently, large dose reductions in OARs were observed. With respect to VMAT, the mean dose and D<sub>40%</sub> in the bilateral hippocampus were on average reduced by 48% and 74%, respectively (p<=0.005). With IMPT, the mean dose in the normal brain and volumes receiving 20-30Gy were up to 47% lower (p<=0.01). When comparing IMPT and IMRT, even larger dose differences in those OARs were observed.CONCLUSION: For skull-base meningiomas IMPT allows for a considerable dose reduction in the hippocampi, normal brain and other OARs compared to both non-coplanar VMAT and IMRT, which may lead to a clinically relevant reduction of late neurocognitive side effects.",Excluded,0.89373916
880,"Vision loss following high-dose proton-based radiotherapy for skull-base chordoma and chondrosarcoma BACKGROUND & PURPOSE: Dose escalation for skull-based chordoma and chondrosarcoma can put critical adjacent structures at risk, specifically the anterior optic pathway. We report the incidence of vision loss following high-dose conformal proton-based radiotherapy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed patients with skull-base chordoma or chondrosarcoma treated with proton-based therapy between 2007 and 2018. We analyzed 148 patients and 283 individual eyes with functional vision at baseline who received a minimum 30GyRBE to 0.1 cm<sup>3</sup> of the anterior optic pathway. Eyes were classified as ""functionally blind"" if visual acuity was 20/200 or worse. Kaplan-Meier and normal tissue complication probability modeling were used to establish the relationship between radiation dose and risk of functional vision loss.RESULTS: At last follow-up, 110 of 148 patients were alive with no evidence of disease progression. With a median follow-up of 4.1 years (range, 0.5-12.8), 5 eyes in 3 patients developed functional blindness, with 2 patients developing bilateral blindness. Median time to blindness was 15.2 months. The 5-year incidence of vision loss was 2.1% (95% CI: 0.9-4.9%). On univariate analysis, development of blindness was associated with presence of multiple medical comorbidities (p = 0.0040). While there were no events with a maximum dose < 60GyRBE delivered to the anterior optic pathway, the crude rate was 3.6% over 60GyRBE, with all events occurring between 60-65GyRBE.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high radiotherapy dose delivered to patients with skull-base chordoma and chondrosarcoma, the rate of vision loss is low and no events occurred in those who received a maximum dose under 60GyRBE.",Excluded,0.8933122
802,"Prospective assessment of white matter integrity in adult stem cell transplant recipients Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is often used in the treatment of hematologic disorders. Although it can be curative, the pre-transplant conditioning regimen can be associated with neurotoxicity. In this prospective study, we examined white matter (WM) integrity with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological functioning before and one year after HSCT in twenty-two patients with hematologic disorders and ten healthy controls evaluated at similar intervals. Eighteen patients received conditioning treatment with high-dose (HD) chemotherapy, and four had full dose total body irradiation (fTBI) and HD chemotherapy prior to undergoing an allogeneic or autologous HSCT. The results showed a significant decrease in mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AD) in diffuse WM regions one year after HSCT (p-corrected <0.05) in the patient group compared to healthy controls. At baseline, patients treated with allogeneic HSCT had higher MD and AD in the left hemisphere WM than autologous HSCT patients (p-corrected <0.05). One year post-transplant, patients treated with allogeneic HSCT had lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher radial diffusivity (RD) in the right hemisphere and left frontal WM compared to patients treated with autologous HSCT (p-corrected <0.05). There were modest but significant correlations between MD values and cognitive test scores, and these were greatest for timed tests and in projection tracts. Patients showed a trend toward a decline in working memory, and had lower cognitive test scores than healthy controls at the one-year assessment. The findings suggest a relatively diffuse pattern of alterations in WM integrity in adult survivors of HSCT.",Excluded,0.89023226
923,"Ionizing radiation induces endothelial transdifferentiation of glioblastoma stem-like cells through the Tie2 signaling pathway Glioblastomas (GBM) are brain tumors with a poor prognosis despite treatment that combines surgical resection and radio-chemotherapy. These tumors are characterized by abundant vascularization and significant cellular heterogeneity including GBM stem-like cells (GSC) which contribute to tumor aggressiveness, resistance, and recurrence. Recent data has demonstrated that GSC are directly involved in the formation of new vessels via their transdifferentiation into Tumor Derived Endothelial Cells (TDEC). We postulate that cellular stress such as ionizing radiation (IR) could enhance the transdifferentiation of GSC into TDEC. GSC neurospheres isolated from 3 different patients were irradiated or not and were then transdifferentiated into TDEC. In fact, TDEC obtained from irradiated GSC (TDEC IR+) migrate more towards VEGF, form more pseudotubes in Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> in vitro and develop more functional blood vessels in Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> plugs implanted in Nude mice than TDEC obtained from non-irradiated GSC. Transcriptomic analysis allows us to highlight an overexpression of Tie2 in TDEC IR+. All IR-induced effects on TDEC were abolished by using a Tie2 kinase inhibitor, which confirms the role of the Tie2 signaling pathway in this process. Finally, by analyzing Tie2 expression in patient GBMs by immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that the number of Tie2+ vessels increases in recurrent GBM compared with matched untreated tumors. In conclusion, we demonstrate that IR potentiates proangiogenic features of TDEC through the Tie2 signaling pathway, which indicates a new pathway of treatment-induced tumor adaptation. New therapeutic strategies that associate standard treatment and a Tie2 signaling pathway inhibitor should be considered for future trials.",Excluded,0.8895131

943,"Cellular Therapies for Treatment of Radiation Injury: Report from a NIH/NIAID and IRSN Workshop In recent years, there has been increasing concern over the possibility of a radiological or nuclear incident occurring somewhere in the world. Intelligence agencies frequently report that terrorist groups and rogue nations are seeking to obtain radiological or nuclear weapons of mass destruction. In addition, there exists the real possibility that safety of nuclear power reactors could be compromised by natural (such as the tsunami and subsequent Fukushima accident in Japan in March, 2011) or accidental (Three Mile Island, 1979 and Chernobyl, 1986) events. Although progress has been made by governments around the world to prepare for these events, including the stockpiling of radiation countermeasures, there are still challenges concerning care of patients injured during a radiation incident. Because the deleterious and pathological effects of radiation are so broad, it is desirable to identify medical countermeasures that can have a beneficial impact on several tissues and organ systems. Cellular therapies have the potential to impact recovery and tissue/organ regeneration for both early and late complications of radiation exposure. These therapies, which could include stem or blood progenitor cells, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) or cells derived from other tissues (e.g., endothelium or placenta), have shown great promise in treating other nonradiation injuries to and diseases of the bone marrow, skin, gastrointestinal tract, brain, lung and heart. To explore the potential use of these therapies in the treatment of victims after acute radiation exposure, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases co-sponsored an international workshop in July, 2015 in Paris, France with the Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire. The workshop included discussions of data available from testing in preclinical models of radiation injury to different organs, logistics associated with the practical use of cellular therapies for a mass casualty incident, as well as international regulatory requirements for authorizing such drug products to be legally and readily used in such incidents.

442,"The influence of narrow-and broad-band UVB radiation on the epidermis apoptosis in experimental animals Studies on apoptosis and the influence of UVB radiation on this process have important cognitive aspects. They are a source of information about the interaction between the ultraviolet radiation and the biological material. The purpose of the study was to compare the narrow- and broad-band UVB radiation in terms of its influence on the epidermis apoptosis in experimental animals. Immunohistochemically, the number of apoptosis cells was counted in the epidermis. In 6 consecutive fields of vision measuring 82.4 mum x 82.4 mum, the number of cells with positive PARP reaction was counted. They were counted in three slices in the control group and in each of the experimental groups. The results underwent statistical analysis. Percentages, arithmetic means and standard deviations were calculated. It was proved that UVB radiation leads to enhanced apoptosis in the epidermis. The largest number of apoptotic cells per a surface assessed was observed in the BB-UVB-D experimental group. In this group there were 20 times more apoptotic cells than in the controls. When the number of apoptotic cells was compared between the narrow-band irradiated group and that irradiated with the broad band of UVB, the latter was found to induce about three times more apoptotic cells than the former did. The data obtained after the analysis of the results allowed for a comparative evaluation of the both radiation wavebands, which was also important from the clinical point of view. A full understanding of the complex apoptosis process can contribute to the knowledge about the process of photocarcinogenesis and help find a possible relation between an increased risk of skin carcinogenesis and a distorted apoptotic response.",Excluded,0.8886661
941,"The effect of space missions on gravity-responsive torsional eye movements Three astronauts underwent preflight, inflight, and postflight testing of spontaneous ocular torsion and of ocular counterrolling (OCR), reflexes governed by the gravity-responsive otolith organs in the inner ear. One astronaut, A, had a 30-day space mission on Euromir '94 and was examined monocularly with SensoMotoric Instruments video-oculography (VOG). The other two astronauts, B and C, were studied with a binocular VOG and flew an 180-day mission on Euromir '95. In space, spontaneous eye torsion in the upright position was found to be substantially offset from baseline Earth-based recordings in all three subjects for the duration of the flights. In addition, the binocular studies showed a marked torsional disconjugacy. On return to Earth, offset and torsional disconjugacy persisted for many days. OCR in response to 30 degrees right and left tilt was examined preflight and postflight. Compared to preflight, Astronaut A showed reduced OCR immediately postflight, which increased over the next few days. Both Astronauts B and C had increased OCR postflight, which gradually approached but did not achieve the preflight values over 13 days postflight. The adaptation of ocular torsion in space in one astronaut and not in the other two, and slow adaptation postflight, may reflect the lack of visual feed-back and the open loop nature of the otolith-ocular torsion reflex.",Excluded,0.8885642
812,"MPTP in mice: treatment, distribution and possible source of contamination Mice were treated daily with [3H]MPTP (30 mg/kg, 1 uCi, s.c.) for 1, 3, and 10 days to determine the fate and localization of tritiated compounds. An untreated mouse was housed either in the same cage (""cage-mate control"") or in an adjacent cage separated by mesh-wire (""near-neighbor control""). The radioactivity measured in blood, brain, liver, and remaining body of [3H]MPTP-treated mice was dependent on the total dose of the drug the animals received and did not vary with the type of tissue analyzed. Significant amounts of radioactivity were found in the tissues of the ""cage-mate control"" mice, but not of the ""near-neighbor control"" mice. The route of transmission appears to be through the urine, as the urine of [3H]MPTP-treated mice was highly radioactive after the drug injection. Only traces of radioactivity were found in their feces and there was no increase in the background radiation in the environment of the cages, indicating that the tritiated compounds were not exhaled. Proper disposal of urinary products of MPTP-treated animals is therefore necessary to reduce the risk of possible drug contamination in humans.",Excluded,0.8882349
1046,"Risk of Hippocampal Metastases in Small Cell Lung Cancer: Implications for Hippocampal Sparing Cranial Irradiation Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) decreases the incidence of brain metastases (BMs) and can improve overall survival. However whole brain radiation therapy is associated with a decline in neurocognitive function. Hippocampal-sparing whole brain radiation therapy (HS-WBRT) aims to minimise damage to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) within the hippocampus and reduce the toxicity of PCI, although there may be an increased risk of treatment failure in the hippocampal region. The incidence of hippocampal metastases was investigated in patients with BMs from SCLC to evaluate the feasibility of HS-WBRT in this population. Method(s): Patients with SCLC presenting between 2000 and 2016 with BMs at presentation or during their disease course without previous cranial irradiation were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Hippocampal metastases (HMs) were defined as metastases within the hippocampus and a 5-mm radial expansion (hippocampus avoidance zone, according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0933 atlas). The rate of hippocampal metastases and associated clinical features were analysed. Result(s): One hundred and twenty eligible patients with a total of 754 brain metastases were identified. In 67 (55.8%) patients BMs were detected at diagnosis of SCLC and in 53 (44.2%) patients BMs developed later without previous PCI. The median number of metastases was 3, and 27 (22.5%) patients had a single BM. There were 22 (18.3%) patients with hippocampal metastases. A total of 23 (3.1%) metastases involved the hippocampal avoidance area. On logistic regression analysis, the number of brain metastases was an independent risk factor for HMs. Conclusion(s): The overall incidence of hippocampal metastases in our cohort of SCLC patients is high. As HS-WBRT may increase the risk of treatment failure in the spared region, prospective randomised trials are encouraged.

Should they be enucleated, or is ocular preservation just as good in terms of survival?METHODS: We performed a retrospective survival analysis of secondary enucleation versus ocular preservation in patients with a posterior uveal melanoma treated by plaque radiotherapy whose irradiated eye became completely blind following that treatment. Of the 79 patients who fulfilled defined inclusion criteria, 25 underwent secondary enucleation of the blind eye, and 54 retained their irradiated blind eye.RESULTS: Most of the baseline demographic and tumour-related variables evaluated were similarly distributed between the subgroups. The 5-year, 10-year and 15-year all-cause death rates in the secondary enucleation subgroup were 24.7%, 51.5% and 52.0% respectively, and those in the ocular preservation subgroup were 7.4%, 32.9% and 48.1% respectively. In spite of the apparent slight difference between the curves, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.41, Mantel-Haenszel test).INTERPRETATION: Although a retrospective study of this type has several limitations, our results suggest that secondary enucleation is not likely to substantially improve survival of patients whose irradiated eye becomes totally blind following plaque radiotherapy for choroidal or ciliochoroidal melanoma.",Excluded,0.8872211

We aimed to identify patients' characteristics and operative factors predictive of early (<= 30-day) and late (<= 6-month) morbidity in cervical cancer patients undergoing surgery plus external beam radiotherapy (EBRT).METHODS: We studied 45 propensity-matched patient pairs (90 patients) undergoing laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (LRH) plus EBRT vs. abdominal radical hysterectomy (RAH) plus EBRT. Basic descriptive, multivariable and artificial neuronal network analyses (ANN) were used to design predicting models influencing outcomes.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the study populations were similar. Patients undergoing LRH experienced lower blood loss (200 (range, 10-700) vs. 400 (range, 100-2000) ml; P < 0.001), shorter length of hospital stay (4 (range, 1-10) vs. 8 (range, 5-52) days; P < 0.001) and similar operative time (235 (+/- 67.3) vs. 258 (+/- 70.2) min; P = 0.14) than patients undergoing RAH. We observed that, at multivariate analysis, open approach correlated with overall (OR: 1.2; 95%CI: 1.03-1.46), early (OR: 1.14; 95%CI:0.99-1.3) and late (OR: 1.13; 95%CI: 1.001-1.28) postoperative complications.CONCLUSIONS: Open approach is the main predictor for developing morbidity among cervical cancer patients undergoing radical hysterectomy followed by adjuvant radiotherapy.

This study evaluates bowel function and related quality of life in patients 2 - 4 years after hemicolectomy, comparing the results to healthy controls. Methods Eligible patients were identified from prospectively maintained colorectal databases at two teaching hospitals. Patients were recruited during regular follow up visits or by telephone interview. Patient relatives with an intact colon were recruited as controls. Study exclusion criteria were poor cognitive ability, inflammatory bowel disease, metastatic disease, previous pelvic radiation, prior colonic, stomach or small bowel resection, bypass surgery, vagotomy, an existing stoma and anal incontinence. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) questionnaire was used to assess bowel function and the EQ-5D questionnaire to assess quality of life (QOL). Parametric and non-parametric tests were used with log transformation and regression methods for skewed data. Association between EQ-5D and MSKCC scores was examined with Spearman's rank correlation. Results A total of 85 patients (mean age 69 +/- 11.2 years) and 85 controls (mean age 58.2 +/- 13.4 years) were recruited in 12 months. Patients reported a significantly higher number of bowel movements per day than controls (2 versus 1, P < 0.001). Initial analysis suggested that patients had a significantly lower total MSKCC score (group difference mean -3.1, CI -5.8 to -0.4, p = 0.02), indicating worse bowel function in the patient group. Following adjustment for age, sex and co-morbidities, differences in total score were no longer significant, but the patient group had a lower score for the frequency subscale and the ability to control flatus (p = 0.008 and p = < 0.001). MSKCC frequency scores were worse after right-sided resections (p = 0.03). High scores for complete emptying and the differentiation between wind and solid had a positive correlation with better QOL (p = 0.007 and 0.02 respectively). There was a nonsignificant decrease in the overall QOL (EQ-5D p = 0.6, EQ-VAS p = 0.12) following hemicolectomy compared with controls. Conclusion Colonic resection has an adverse effect on bowel frequency with worse outcomes following right hemicolectomy. Good colonic function, as assessed by the MSKCC questionnaire, is associated with better QOL.",Excluded,0.8847836

We hypothesized that autoregulation would be different before flight and after flight between nonfinishers and the finishers of a stand test.METHODS: Twenty-seven astronauts from shuttle missions lasting 8 to 16 days underwent a 10-minute stand test: 10 days before flight, 1 to 2 hours and 3 days after landing. Mean blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was measured using transcranial Doppler; Mean arterial pressure was measured using a Finapres (Ohmeda, Englewood, CO) and was adjusted to the level of the MCA (BP(MCA)). Cross-spectral power, gain, phase, and coherence were determined for the relation between BP(MCA) and the cerebrovascular resistance index mean blood flow velocity/BP(MCA).RESULTS: BP(MCA) was reduced with stand (P<0.001). Differences between finishers and nonfinishers (P=0.011) and over test days (P=0.004) were observed. Cerebrovascular conductance was affected by stand (P<0.001), by group (P<0.001) with a group by stand, and test day interaction (P<0.01). Preflight data suggest that the nonfinishers were operating at a higher cerebral vasodilation than finishers for a given BP(MCA), and on landing day the nonfinishers had a greater decrease in mean blood flow velocity as a function of BP(MCA) with standing compared to finishers and preflight. There was a significant interaction effect of gender over the test days and from supine to stand (P=0.035).CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the cause of presyncope in astronauts may be related to a mismatch of cerebral blood flow with blood pressure. Astronaut gender may also play a role in susceptibility to orthostatic intolerance after flight.",Excluded,0.8812608

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) was found to be dysregulated in various cancers and an association of the activation of mTORC1 with meningioma and schwannoma growth was reported. The pharmaceutical inhibition of mTOR was identified as a potential strategy for the augmentation of radiation-induced cell damages in different cancers although the detailed molecular mechanisms are not completely understood. Furthermore as mTOR inhibitors particularly show suppression of double-strand break repair a role for a combined therapy by mTOR-inhibitors and carbon ion irradiation is to hypothesize. Our aim was to analyse the effect of the mTOR inhibitor Temsirolimus alone and in combination with irradiation by photons or carbon ions in primary human meningioma cells. Methods. Tumour specimens from 6 patients suffering from meningiomas, 4 with WHO Grad I and 2 with WHO Grade II, were obtained after surgical resection from the Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital of Saarland, Homburg/Saar, Germany, plated on tissue culture plates and cultured under standard conditions as previously described. Primary cells up to passage 7 were treated with irradiation by carbon ions (0.125 to 2 Gy) or photons (0.5 to 8 Gy) alone and in combination with Temsirolimus (0.5 to 2 muM). Furthermore meningioma cells were treated with Temsirolimus alone (0.5 to 5 muM). Cell proliferation was measured by counting cells 6 days after treatment. Results. A dose-dependent reduction of meningioma cells was observed after irradiation by photons as well as by carbon ions. The biological impact on cell reduction after irradiation by carbon ions seems to be four times stronger in comparison to irradiation by photons. The treatment with Temsirolimus alone in a concentration up to 5 muM causes a cell reduction of 69% in benign WHO Grade I meningioma cells whereas WHO Grade II meningioma cells were only reduced by 31%. The combination of irradiation and Temsirolimus in concentrations up to 2 muM effects a further cell reduction for both carbon ions (0.5 Gy) and photons (2 Gy) up to 30% in comparisons to irradiation alone. Conclusion. Our study shows promising preliminary results regarding the antiproliferative effect on meningioma cells by mTOR inhibitor Temsirolimus alone and as a radiosensitizer in combination with irradiation by photons or carbon ions.

990,"Treatment of salivary gland neoplasms with fast neutron radiotherapy OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of fast neutron radiotherapy for the treatment of salivary gland neoplasms.DESIGN: Retrospective analysis.SETTING: University of Washington Cancer Center, Neutron Facility, Seattle.PATIENTS: The medical records of 279 patients treated with curative intent using fast neutron radiotherapy at the University of Washington Cancer Center were reviewed. Of the 279 patients, 263 had evidence of gross residual disease at the time of treatment (16 had no evidence of gross residual disease), 141 had tumors of a major salivary gland, and 138 had tumors of minor salivary glands. The median follow-up period was 36 months (range, 1-142 months).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local-regional control, cause-specific survival, and freedom from metastasis.RESULTS: The 6-year actuarial cause-specific survival rate was 67%. Multivariate analysis revealed that low group stage (I-II) disease, minor salivary sites, lack of skull base invasion, and primary disease were associated with a statistically significant improvement in cause-specific survival. The 6-year actuarial local-regional control rate was 59%. Multivariate analysis revealed size 4 cm or smaller, lack of base of skull invasion, prior surgical resection, and no previous radiotherapy to have a statistically significant improved local-regional control. Sixteen patients without evidence of gross residual disease had a 100% 6-year actuarial local-regional control. The 6-year actuarial freedom from metastasis rate was 64%. Factors associated with decreased development of systemic metastases included negative lymph nodes at the time of treatment and lack of base of skull involvement. The 6-year actuarial rate of development of grade 3 or 4 long-term toxicity (using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research on the Treatment of Cancer criteria) was 10%. No patient experienced grade 5 toxic effects.CONCLUSIONS: Neuron radiotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with salivary gland neoplasms who have gross residual disease and achieves excellent local-regional control in patients without evidence of gross disease.",Excluded,0.8744485

Method(s): From June 2015 to December 2016, 177 cases with NPC in our hospital were finally enrolled and randomly divided into three groups: IMRT only group (I group), hippocampal sparing IMRT (H group) and celecoxib combined with hippocampal sparing IMRT group (Ce group). Cognitive function and life quality were evaluated three months after treatment via Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Quality of life questionnaire (QLQ C30) respectively. Indicators for therapeutic effects including complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), adverse reactions, recurrence and metastasis of tumor and serum tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of patients were also compared. Result(s): Before the intervention, there was no difference in cognitive function score among all the patients (P=0.876).

Life quality scores about cognitive function and role function of H group and Ce group were higher than that of I group while Ce group was the highest (Cognitive function: P=0.020, Ce vs. H; P=0.015, Ce vs. I and P=0.023, H vs. I; role function: P=0.039, Ce vs. H; P=0.011, Ce vs. I and P=0.031, H vs. I). Conclusion(s): Celecoxib combined with hippocampus sparing IMRT for the treatment of NPC patients could drastically alleviate cognitive dysfunction, improve life quality and reduce the occurrence of adverse events compared with hippocampal sparing IMRT and IMRT only.

982,"BDNF Met allele as a risk factor for inflammation-induced depression in breast cancer survivors Inflammation may contribute to the development of depression in a subset of individuals. However, risk factors that render certain individuals more vulnerable to depression following an inflammatory stimulus have not been determined. Drawing from animal stud-ies showing that reductions in neural plasticity may mediate effects of inflammation on depressive symptoms, we hypothesized that individuals genetically predisposed to lower levels of neural plasticity may be more susceptible to inflammation-induced depression. More specifically, the current study examined whether the Met allele of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, which predisposes individuals to reduced levels of plasticity, moderates the association between inflammation and depressive symptoms. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of 111 women with early-stage breast cancer who had recently completed treatment with surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy, which can activate inflammatory pathways. Participants provided blood draws for genotyping and assessment of circulating inflammatory markers, and completed a questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms, including somatic, affective, and cognitive components of depression. Results revealed a significant interaction between BDNF genotype and CRP in predicting depressive symptoms (p =.036), such that women carrying at least one Met allele displayed a stronger association between CRP and cognitive depressive symptoms than those without a Met allele. A similar interaction emerged for IL-1ra (p =.055). Results support the hypothesis that the BDNF Met allele may be a risk factor for inflam-mation-induced depression among breast cancer survivors.",Excluded,0.8720177
96,"Single Vocal Cord Irradiation: Image Guided Intensity Modulated Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for T1a Glottic Cancer: Early Clinical Results PURPOSE: To report, from a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, on the feasibility, outcome, toxicity, and voice-handicap index (VHI) of patients with T1a glottic cancer treated by a novel intensity modulated radiation therapy technique developed at our institution to treat only the involved vocal cord: single vocal cord irradiation (SVCI).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients with T1a glottic cancer were treated by means of SVCI. Dose prescription was set to 16 x 3.63 Gy (total dose 58.08 Gy). The clinical target volume was the entire vocal cord. Setup verification was done by means of an online correction protocol using cone beam computed tomography. Data for voice quality assessment were collected prospectively at baseline, end of treatment, and 4, 6, and 12 weeks and 6, 12, and 18 months after treatment using VHI questionnaires.RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 7-50 months), the 2-year local control and overall survival rates were 100% and 90% because no single local recurrence was reported and 3 patients died because of comorbidity. All patients have completed the intended treatment schedule; no treatment interruptions and no grade 3 acute toxicity were reported. Grade 2 acute dermatitis or dysphagia was reported in only 5 patients (17%). No serious late toxicity was reported; only 1 patient developed temporary grade 2 laryngeal edema, and responded to a short-course of corticosteroid. The VHI improved significantly, from 33.5 at baseline to 9.5 and 10 at 6 weeks and 18 months, respectively (P<.001). The control group, treated to the whole larynx, had comparable local control rates (92.2% vs 100%, P=.24) but more acute toxicity (66% vs 17%, P<.0001) and higher VHI scores (23.8 and 16.7 at 6 weeks and 18 months, respectively, P<.0001).CONCLUSION: Single vocal cord irradiation is feasible and resulted in maximal local control rate at 2 years. The deterioration in VHI scores was slight and temporary and subsequently improved to normal levels. Long-term follow-up is needed to consolidate these promising results.",Excluded,0.87095463

For each patient, identical CT sets with structures were used for both CO-VMAT and NC-VMAT planning. For CO-VMAT, one full arc and two coplanar half arcs were used. For NC-VMAT, one full coplanar and two non-coplanar half arcs with couch rotation of 315degree or 45degree were used. Dose constraints were adhered to the RTOG 0614, RTOG 0933 and TMH protocol. Dose volumetric parameters were collected for statistical analysis.Results: .NC-VMAT achieved significant dose reduction in contralateral hippocampus, both temporal lobes and cochleae, and other OARs while the plan qualities remained the same. In particular, NC-VMAT decreased contralateral hippocampus mean dose by 1.67Gy. Similarly, the NC-VMAT decreased temporal lobe mean dose by 6.29Gy and 2.8Gy for ipsilateral and contralateral side respectively. Furthermore, it decreased cochlea mean dose by 5.34Gy and 0.97Gy for ipsilateral and contralateral side respectively. Overall, there was a reduction of 5.4% of normal brain tissue volume receiving low dose irradiation.Conclusion: The proposed NC-VMAT showed more favourable plan quality than the CO-VMAT for primary brain tumours, in particular to hippocampus, temporal lobes, cochleae and OARs located to the contralateral side of tumours.Advances in knowledge: For primary brain tumours radiotherapy, NC-VMAT can reduce doses to the hippocampus, both temporal lobes, and cochleae, as well as OARs located to the contralateral side of tumours.",Excluded,0.8696618
477,"Single fraction prophylactic cranial irradiation for small cell carcinoma of the lung The effectiveness of a single 8-Gy fraction prophylactic cranial irradiation regime was assessed in 106 patients with small-cell carcinoma of the lung. All patients had limited stage disease and received combination chemotherapy consisting of either cisplatin or carboplatin with ifosfamide, etoposide, and vincristine (VICE). Cranial irradiation was administered 48 h after the first cycle of chemotherapy and was well tolerated. Actual 2-year survival was 35% and cranial relapse occurred in 22% of those patients who achieved complete remission. This compares favourably with a cranial relapse rate of 45% incomplete remitters previously reported with the same chemotherapy regime after a minimum follow-up of 2 years where PCI was not used. Formal psychometric testing was performed retrospectively on a series of 25 long-term survivors of whom 14 were taken from this reported series. Whilst 75% of patients were impaired on at least one test with 68% performing badly in the most complex task, this was not associated with clinically detectable neurological damage and the patients did not complain of memory or concentration difficulties. In conclusion, single fraction PCI, when used with platinum based combination chemotherapy, appears to be equally effective but may be less neurotoxic than the more standard fractionated regimes.",Excluded,0.8695883
808,"Effect of Neoadjuvant Therapy and Rectal Surgery on Health-related Quality of Life in Patients With Rectal Cancer During the First 2 Years After Diagnosis INTRODUCTION: Rectal cancer surgery with neoadjuvant therapy is associated with substantial morbidity. The present study describes the course of quality of life (QOL) in rectal cancer patients in the first 2 years after the start of treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study within a colorectal cancer cohort including rectal cancer patients who were referred for neoadjuvant chemoradiation or short-course radiotherapy and underwent rectal surgery. QOL was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and colorectal cancer questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-CR29) before treatment and after 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The outcomes were compared with the QOL scores from the Dutch general population and stratified by low anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection. Postoperative bowel dysfunction after low anterior resection was measured using the low anterior resection syndrome score.RESULTS: Of the 324 patients, 272 (84%) responded to at least 2 questionnaires and were included in the present study. Compared with pretreatment levels, the strongest decline was observed in physical, role, and social functioning at 3 and 6 months after the start of treatment. Global health and cognitive functioning declined to a lesser extend, and emotional functioning gradually improved over the time. Within 24 months, the QOL scores had recovered toward the pretreatment levels in most patients. Compared with the general population, physical, role, social, and cognitive functioning and symptoms of fatigue and insomnia remained significantly worse in patients on longer-term. After low anterior resection, major bowel dysfunction was reported by 44% to 60% of the patients. Increasing urinary incontinence and severe complaints of impotence were observed in patients who had undergone abdominoperineal resection.CONCLUSION: Rectal cancer treatment is associated with a significant decline in QOL during the first 6 months after the diagnosis. Within 2 years, most patients return toward pretreatment functioning but could still experience poorer functioning and treatment-related symptoms compared with the general population. These findings support shared decision-making and emphasize the need for postoperative supportive care and novel treatment approaches.",Excluded,0.8680905

Thirty-nine patients treated with FSRT for anterior skull base meningiomas and 55 patients treated with FSRT for pituitary adenomas between January 1999 and December 2009 with at least 2 years follow-up were included. Patients were followed up prospectively with magnetic resonance imaging scans, visual acuity and visual field examinations. RION was found in four (10%) patients with anterior skull base meningiomas and seven patients (13%) with pituitary adenomas. The five-year actuarial freedom from 25% RION visual field loss was 94% following FSRT. Actuarial 2-, 5- and 10-year tumor control rates were 100, 88.4 and 64.5% for anterior skull base meningiomas and 100, 98.2 and 94.9% for pituitary adenomas, respectively. Patients with an impaired visual field function pre-FSRT were more likely to experience worsened function (p = 0.016). We found that RION, was a relatively uncommon event, in a large prospective cohort of patients that were systematically monitored following FSRT of benign anterior skull base tumors.

1098,"Mutagen hypersensitivity in Friedreich's ataxia Cultured blood lymphocytes from nine patients with Friedreich's ataxia (FrA) and nine matched controls were exposed to a series of graded doses of mitomycin C and ethyl methane sulphonate and examined for the incidence of sister chromatid exchange (SCE). The spontaneous SCE levels did not differ between patients and controls, but the cells from each of the patients showed a significantly enhanced response to the induction of SCE by both mutagens - the patients' cells being up to 50% more sensitive than controls. Cultures from five FrA patients and five controls were analysed to determine the spontaneous incidence of chromosomal aberrations and exposed to a graded series of X-ray doses to measure their response to radiation-induced chromosome damage. The spontaneous aberration incidence in controls did not differ from that found in other control series, but the background incidence of aberrations in cells from the FrA patients was significantly above control levels and appeared to reflect an enhanced response to diagnostic exposure to radionuclides. The FrA cells showed a significantly enhanced in vitro response to chromosome aberration induction by X-rays, the net aberration yields being some 60% greater than those in irradiated controls at doses up to 200 rads. It is concluded that FrA is yet another syndrome which shows hypersensitivity to the induction of chromosome damage by mutagens. Possible factors responsible for this hypersensitivity are discussed and comparisons drawn with ataxia telangiectasia, another autosomal recessive disease characterized by enhanced X-ray sensitivity.",Excluded,0.8622954
780,"Long-term angiographic and clinical outcome after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and intracoronary radiation therapy in humans BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation has been shown to reduce neointimal formation after balloon angioplasty in experimental models of restenosis. This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of intracoronary radiation therapy (ICRT) after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for preventing restenosis in human coronary arteries.METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (22 arteries) with unstable angina underwent standard balloon angioplasty. ICRT was performed with the use of an 192Ir source wire that was hand delivered to the angioplasty site. Angiographic follow-up was performed at 24 hours, between 30 and 60 days, and at 6 months. Angioplasty was successful in 19 of 22 lesions, and insertion of the radioactive source wire was successful at all treated sites. Angiographic study at 24 hours demonstrated early late loss of the luminal diameter from 1.92+/-0.55 to 1.40+/-0.27 mm. Between 30 and 60 days, repeat angiography demonstrated total occlusion in 2 arteries, a new pseudoaneurysm in 1 artery, and significant dilatation at the treatment site in 2 additional vessels. At > or = 6 months' follow-up, all remaining arteries (n=20) maintained patent, with a mean lumen diameter of 1.65+/-0.8 mm. The calculated late lumen loss was 0.27+/-0.56 mm, and the late loss index was 0.19. Clinical events at 1 year included myocardial infarction in 1 patient, repeat angioplasty to the treated site in 3 patients, and persistent angina in 7 patients.CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results demonstrate that ICRT after coronary intervention is feasible and is associated with an acceptable degree of complications and lower rates of angiographic restenosis indexes.",Excluded,0.86228585

The most frequent findings across all follow-up examinations were macular microaneurysms (75.6% of examinations), macular angiographic leakage (75.1%), and optic disc hyperfluorescence (62.8%). The median number of features present increased significantly with each follow-up to a maximum of 7 features at 8 years. The prevalence of neovascularization of the disc at 5 years was 5.2%. The prevalence of optic neuropathy at 5 years was 27.4%. Prognostic factors for more prevalent and severe posterior pole abnormalities were diabetes, tumor location close to both optic nerve and foveal avascular zone, and greater dose of radiation to the foveola and optic nerve head.CONCLUSIONS: The amount and severity of retinopathy and optic neuropathy after iodine-125 brachytherapy increased through 8 years of follow-up. Assessment of photographs and angiograms taken in accord with a standard protocol provided reliable estimates of rates of development of features of retinopathy and optic neuropathy in eyes treated using the COMS brachytherapy protocol.

Proton beams suitable for this are under development. The clinical effects of high single doses on malignant gliomas grade III-IV are presently tested with conventional gamma radiation. Targeting of spread glioma cells with toxic radionuclides tagged to epidermal growth factor, EGF, or to EGF-dextran is presently tested in experimental systems and can, in the near future, be tested in combination with local high doses of external proton radiation.

889,"Characteristics of spontaneous and induced specific-locus mutation in the ad-3 region of Neurospora crassa: utilization in genetic risk assessment Data from experiments on the induction of specific-locus mutations in model systems are utilized in genetic risk assessment to estimate potential adverse effects in the human population. In such assessments with radiation or chemical mutagens, the following information is required: (1) spontaneous and induced forward-mutation frequencies, (2) dose-response curves for the overall induction of specific-locus mutations, (3) genetic characterization of spontaneous and induced mutations, and (4) dose-response curves for the different genotypic classes. Specific-locus assays in most eukaryote assay systems provide only portions of the information required for genetic risk assessment. In recognition of the need for a more comprehensive data base, a model system was developed for specific-locus studies in Neurospora crassa. The adenine-3 (ad-3) specific-locus assay was modeled after the 2 gene, morphological specific-locus assay in the dilute-short-ear region of the mouse, and it detects forward-mutations at two closely linked loci: ad-3A and ad-3B. The ad-3 assay system has provided precise dose-response curves not only for inactivation, but also the overall induction of ad-3 mutations. The utilization of this assay in experiments with radiation or chemical mutagens has provided a data base on the induction and genetic characterization of specific-locus mutations that is unique among eukaryotic organisms. In this assay, gene/point mutations, multilocus deletion mutations, and 3 different classes of multiple-locus mutations can be identified. The latter consist of specific-locus mutations associated with recessive lethal mutations located either closely linked to the ad-3 region or elsewhere in the genome. The overall data base on the heterozygous effects of X-ray-induced ad-3 mutations demonstrates that such effects are allele specific, genotype specific, and locus specific. There are probably a variety of mechanisms by which the heterozygous effects of individual allelic mutations at different genetic loci can be affected. In conclusion, unless the frequencies of all of the different classes of induced specific-locus mutations are determined, and utilized in genetic risk assessment exercises, the risk of human exposure to environmental mutagens may be grossly underestimated.

Palliative efficacy and predictive factors of response in 78 procedures] BACKGROUND: Assessment of palliative effect of hemibody irradiation (HBI) and response-related factors.METHODS: Analysis of prospective collected data of 78 procedures on 71 patients with multiple symptomatic bone metastases, treated with 6 Gy (upper half-body) or 8 Gy (lower half-body) HBI in single fraction. Clinical improvement was quantified by self-evaluation on a visual analogic scale (SVAS) before HBI, and at 24, 48 and 72 hours, at 7 days, and at each monthly control until patient's death. Univariate analysis included: sex, Karnofsky's index, tumor origin, histology, HBI dose, and SVAS before treatment. For statistical purposes the significance level was 0.05.RESULTS: Complete (37.5%) or partial responses were observed in 72/78 (92.3%) procedures, 80% appearing during the first 72 hours. Difference between mean SVAS, before and after treatment (7.7 +/- 1.5 vs 2.8 +/- 2.5), was statistically significant (p < 0.001). A mean response duration of 101 days over a mean overall survival of 141 days implies the 70% of expected patient's life span.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current glioblastoma (GBM) therapies prolong survival, but overall prognosis is still poor. Irradiation of the subventricular zone (SVZ) has recently been discussed as a promising concept as this tissue harbors stem cells which seem to play a role in the initiation and recurrence of GBM. In this study, we retrospectively examined the relationship of SVZ irradiation dose and survival in a large, homogeneous GBM patient cohort.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 200 GBM patients who had been treated at our institution with trimodal therapy (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) between 2009 and 2020. The SVZ was delineated, and dose-volume histograms were calculated and extracted. Tumors were classified according to their contact with the SVZ. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis, and univariable and multivariable Cox regression (MVA) were used to determine prognostic effects on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: Median PFS of the study group was 7.2 months; median OS was 15.1 months. In MVA (with mean dose to the ipsilateral SVZ as a continuous covariable), PFS was significantly lower for patients with a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) < 70% and without MGMT promoter methylation. Factors prognostic for shorter OS were old age, lower KPS, unmethylated MGMT status, SVZ contact and biopsy instead of subtotal- or gross total resection. There was no significant correlation between survival and SVZ dose.CONCLUSION: In this cohort, an increased mean dose to the ipsilateral or contralateral SVZ did not correlate with improved survival in irradiated GBM patients in MVA.

At this age, the New Hampshire (NH) breed had a larger proportion of lymphoid volume to total pineal volume (32%) than did pineal glands from White Leghorn (WL) chickens (18%). Averaged over the period 23 to 62 da, NH chickens (a heavy breed) had a lymphoid volume (0.753 mm 3) that was about three times greater (P less than 0.05) than that of the lighter WL breed (0.251 mm 3). Lymphocytes are able to enter cerebrospinal fluid form lymphoid accumulations (LA) embedded in the choroid plexus by migrating between choroid ependymal cells. The 122-da chickens typically lacked lymphoid tissue in the pineal gland with the exception of occasional LA contained in capsular tissue. Surgical bursectomy, thymectomy, or their combination at hatching followed with whole-body irradiation (IR) at 24 hours postsurgery inhibited the initial influx of lymphocytes usually seen in 9-da pineal glands. Also, these treatments prevented formation of germinal centers normally found in the pineal at 3 and 5 weeks and reduced total pineal volume at each age examined. However, pineal lymphoid volume of the surgical-IR group did not differ from control-IR chickens at either 3 or 5 weeks. Pineal glands from birds made agammaglobulinemic (bursa-cell depleted) by cyclophosphamide treatment in ovo were devoid of germinal centers, although thin strands of lymphocytes were usually found along venous sinuses. These dissociation studies suggest that the normal expression of lymphoid tissue in the chicken pineal gland is dependent on the bursa and thymus. Furthermore, these observations indicate that the pineal gland should be considered a functional component of the chicken's lymphomyeloid complex.",Excluded,0.81676143
823,"Dosimetry analysis of intensity-modulated and conformal radiation therapy for head and neck tumors. [Hungarian] The aim of the study was to compare different treatment plans - intensity-modulated and conformal - for head and neck cancer patients. Treatment plans were developed for ten head and neck cancer patients by applying four different techniques: two conventional 3D conformal plans (forward treatment planning, with two opposing fields 90degree-270degree and one asymmetric anterior field, matching in isocenter /Conv/, conformal parotis sparing plans /ConPas/), 3D conformal plans with inverse treatment planning techniques /INVCRT/ and intensity-modulated radiation therapy plans /IMRT/. The plans were made for the same target volumes PTV<inf>50</inf> (elective) and PTV<inf>66</inf> (boost-16 Gy). The cumulative dose was 66 Gy, and the Philips Pinnacle3 v8.0m TPS was used for treatment planning. The organs at risk (OAR) were as follows: spinal cord, brain stem, left and right parotis and oral cavity. The dose constrains and conditions for optimization were determined for IMRT techniques with 7 fields. During the optimization we applied two different protocols: in one case the plans were made by 40 segments for ""step and shoot"" IMRT techniques and by 14 segments for INVCRT, which were converted into static fields. The homogeneity (HI) and conformity (COIN) indices were calculated for planning target volumes and the comparisons were assessed on several dosimetric parameters for OARs. The IMRT, INVCRT, Conv and ConPas techniques for PTV<inf>50</inf> planning target volume gave the following values for homogeneity index: 0.13, 0.18, 0.22, 0.19, and for conformity index: 0.76, 0.68, 0.13, 0.09. The spinal cord received a maximum of 38 Gy, 42 Gy, 45 Gy and 44 Gy for the PTV<inf>66</inf>. Mean doses of the oral cavity outside the target volume were 33 Gy, 36 Gy, 30 Gy and 48 Gy. When the 16 Gy boost treatment was applied on one side only, the mean dose for the parotis on the contralateral side was 28 Gy, 31 Gy, 49 Gy and 43 Gy, while 39 Gy, 41 Gy, 59 Gy and 53 Gy on the same side. The objectives of adequate target coverage and sparing of critical structures were fulfilled only with IMRT technique. Although the sparing of the oral cavity was the most effectively provided by the traditional technique - due to the arrangement of the fields - it gave the worst results regarding the parotis and the target volume. The highest dose for the oral cavity was given by the ConPas technique, which can cause serious early and late side effects. By increasing the number of segments for IMRT at a reasonable level, the dose for OARs can be reduced. Copyright Â© Professional Publishing Hungary.",Excluded,0.8101725

841,"Whole-brain radiotherapy combined with surgery or stereotactic radiotherapy in patients with brain oligometastases: long-term analysis OBJECTIVE: To verify whether the treatment of brain oligometastases with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) plus stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) or surgical resection results in different outcomes.METHODS: Files of patients affected by brain metastases submitted to surgical resection followed by WBRT (group A) or WBRT + SRT (group B) were retrospectively selected for this study. The two treatment groups were matched for the following potential prognostic factors: WBRT schedule, age, gender, performance status, tumor type, number of brain metastases, extra-cerebral metastases, and recursive partitioning analysis class (RPA). The outcomes of patients in both groups were evaluated in terms of toxicity, local control, and overall survival.RESULTS: Total of 97 patients were selected (56 male; 42 female) who were respectively submitted to surgical resection followed by WBRT (group A, n = 50 patients) or WBRT + SRT (Group B, n = 47 patients). Median follow-up was 95 months (range, 8-171 months). The 1-year local control rates were 46.0% and 69.0% respectively. No significant difference in local tumor control was observed between group A and B (p = 0.10). Median overall survival was 15 and 19 months in group A and B, respectively. One-year survival was 56.0% and 62%, respectively. No difference was observed in the two groups (p = 0.40).CONCLUSION: Surgery remains the main therapeutic approach in symptomatic patients; nevertheless, our data support the use of WBRT plus SRT in one or two brain metastases smaller than 3 cm.",Excluded,0.8020579
1071,"Emesis and gastrointestinal problems during radiotherapy: a comparison of performance of daily activities between patients experiencing nausea and patients free from nausea PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH: To describe the experiences of nausea, vomiting and gastrointestinal problems during radiotherapy, and to compare patients experiencing nausea with patients not experiencing nausea regarding performance in daily activities, sleeping and eating capacity.METHODS AND SAMPLE: A cross-sectional sample of 131 Swedish radiotherapy patients answered a questionnaire regarding the preceding week of radiotherapy. Mean age was 63 years (standard deviation 12.1) and 56% were women. The radiotherapy fields were breast (35%), abdomen/pelvis (15%), prostate/bladder (21%), head/neck (10%) and other (8%).KEY RESULTS: The patients experiencing nausea within the observed week (n=31) had, compared to the patients not experiencing nausea (n=100), lower ability in daily activities in general (p=0.001), in shopping (p=0.014), walking (p=0.007) and social interaction (p=0.007). Of the patients with nausea 48% had seldom woken up rested and 34% were not able to eat as much as they used to. Corresponding figures for nausea free patients were 27% (not significant; ns) and 16% (ns). Six (5%) experienced vomiting, 15 (12%) diarrhoea, 23 (18%) constipation and 52 (40%) any gastrointestinal symptoms. Forty seven (90%) were negatively bothered by the experienced gastrointestinal symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: The fourth of patients experiencing nausea during radiotherapy had lower ability to perform daily activities than the three quarters of patients who were free from nausea. Few patients vomited while 40% experienced gastrointestinal symptoms during the observed week of radiotherapy. This implies that health care professionals could consider identifying nauseous patients that possibly need support in nausea-reduction and in daily activities during radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.8014824
1104,"Patterns of care for patients with small cell lung cancer: A survey of German radiation oncology institutions on recommendations for prophylactic cranial irradiation Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation in SCLC was first proposed in 1973 and is recommended for patients demonstrating good response to initial therapy. The general pattern of care amongst radiation oncologists in Germany has not been previously evaluated.We conceptualized and conducted this survey to assess patterns of care. Method(s): We surveyed radiation oncology institutions in Germany via an online questionnaire sent by e-mail to member institutions of the German Society for Radiation Oncology (DEGRO e.V.). The questions were based on respondent and treatment characteristics with emphasis on prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited- and extensive-stage SCLC. Result(s):We receivedatotal of95responses (29%response rate). Of which 64were completed and returned and hence eligible for evaluation. Sixty-one percent of respondents were between the ages of 50-59, 88%with over 15 years of experience in the management of lungmalignancies. Sixtysevenpercent of the institutions stage theirpatients initially with 18F-FDG-PET/CT. Of the 64 responses, 97% recommended deliveryofPCI in therapy responders with LS-SCLC compared to 67% with ES-SCLC. Interestingly, a quarter of respondents offered hippocampal-avoidance PCI with only 38% following their patients with serial brain imaging followingPCI.Neuropsychological testingwas generally not routinely performed. Conclusion(s): German radiation oncology institutions showed interesting variations in certain aspects yet in general congruence in SCLC management and PCI delivery in accordance with the updated national and international guidelines.

1090,"[Retrospective analysis of patients with small cell lung cancer treated at Gazi University Department of Radiation Oncology] The combination of radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy (CT) is the main treatment modality of limited-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The application of radiation timing, doses, fraction schedules in this modality and the indication of prophylactic cranial irradiation is recently controversial. In this retrospective study, these subjects were evaluated by considering our patients results. Seventy patients having adequate data for examination with limited-stage SCLC were referred to our clinic in the period between December 1995 and December 2002. The patients were classified according to their response to CT, the dose and timing of RT applications. The effects of obtained variables on overall survival were analyzed. Male/ female ratio was 5/1; and the mean age was 55 years (range 31-80 years). The mean follow-up of all patients was 10 months and the mean survival time was 16 months. An objective (complete and partial) response to CT administered before RT was seen in 47 (67%) patients. The survival time was better in the CT responding patients (median 11 months versus 6 months, p= 0.002). The application of more than 50 Gy radiation dose was found to be ineffective on survival. An improvement in survival was observed in RT application beginning before fourth cycle CT (median 14 months versus 8 months p= 0.01). In despite of the ineffectiveness of prophylactic cranial irradiation on survival is observed in survival analysis, it was found to be a parameter affecting survival in Cox-regression analysis. However the most frequently complication during RT was oesophagitis. Grade III was seen in 1 (3%) patient. The response to CT can be accepted as an indicator for survival. We concluded that the administering of RT in the beginning of CT, not administering radiation doses of more than 50 Gy and the necessity of applying prophylactic cranial irradiation to all patients showing complete response are points to be considered according to our retrospective analysis.",Excluded,0.7952321
366,"Comprehensive analysis of the role of DNA repair gene polymorphisms on risk of glioma Much of the variation in inherited risk of glioma is likely to be explained by combinations of common low risk variants. The established relationship between glioma risk and exposure to ionizing radiation led us to examine whether variants in the DNA repair genes contribute to disease susceptibility. We evaluated 1127 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) supplemented with 388 putative functional SNPs to capture most of the common variation in 136 DNA repair genes, in five unique case-control series from four different countries (1013 cases, 1016 controls). We identified 16 SNPs associated with glioma risk at the 1% significance level. The highest association observed across the five independent case-control datasets involved rs243356, which maps to intron 3 of CHAF1A (trend odds ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval 1.14-1.54; P = 0.0002; false-positive report probability = 0.055, based on a prior probability of 0.01). Our results provide additional support for the hypothesis that low penetrance variants contribute to the risk of developing glioma and suggest that a genetic variant located in or around the CHAF1A gene contributes to disease risk.",Excluded,0.78836256

Skeletal muscle mass was measured as total psoas area and total abdominal muscle area (TAMA) at 3 anatomical levels using the patient's preoperative computed tomography scan. Radiation attenuation was measured using corresponding mean Hounsfield units for TAMA. Sarcopenic obesity was defined as body mass index above 25 kg.m-2 combined with skeletal muscle mass index below the sex-specific median. Postoperative complications were graded by using the -Clavien-Dindo classification.RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (25.3%) developed a grade 3-5 complication. Lower radiation attenuation was independently associated with overall (p = 0.003) and grade 3-5 complications (p = 0.002). Sarcopenic obesity was associated with overall complications (all p < 0.05). Skeletal muscle measurements and survival were not significantly related.CONCLUSION: Radiation attenuation was associated with overall and grade 3-5 postoperative morbidity after neoadjuvant chemoradiation and non-laparoscopic resection for rectal cancer.

Analysis of clinical outcome from radiosurgery calls into question some of the radiobiological principles that have guided conventional fractionated radiotherapy in the past. The response of the tumor or target tissue being irradiated, as well as the response of the surrounding normal tissue, seems predominantly determined by the tumor or target vasculature. Injury to the tumor or target vasculature appears to contribute to the probability of developing normal tissue complications. Estimations of alpha/beta values from radiosurgical dose-response data consistently yield values that conflict with values from fractionated radiotherapy and with linear-quadratic theory. This indicates that projections from high-dose single-fractions to fractionated dose-equivalents made using the linear-quadratic formula are unreliable.

31,"Potential role of intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the treatment of tumors of the maxillary sinus Purpose: To assess 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques to see whether doses to critical structures could be reduced while maintaining planning target volume (PTV) coverage in patients receiving conventional radiotherapy (RT) for carcinoma of the maxillary sinus because of the risk of radiation-induced complications, particularly visual loss. Methods and Materials: Six patients who had recently received conventional RT for carcinoma of the maxillary sinus were studied. Conventional RT, 3D-CRT, and step-and-shoot IMRT plans were prepared using the same 2-field arrangement. The effect of reducing the number of segments in the IMRT beams was investigated. Result(s): 3D-CRT and IMRT reduced the brain and ipsilateral parotid gland doses compared with the conventional plans. IMRT reduced doses to both optic nerves; for the contralateral optic nerve, 15-segment IMRT plans delivered an average maximal dose of 56.4 Gy (range 53.9-59.3) compared with 65.7 Gy (range 65.3-65.9) and 64.2 Gy (range 61.4-65.6) for conventional RT and 3D-CRT, respectively. IMRT also gave improved PTV homogeneity and improved coverage, with an average of 8.5% (range 7.0-11.7%) of the volume receiving <95% of the prescription dose (64 Gy) compared with 14.7% (range 14.1-15.9%) and 15.1% (range 14.4-16.1%) with conventional RT and 3D-CRT, respectively. Little difference was found between the 15 and 7-segment plans, but 5 segments resulted in a reduced minimal PTV dose. Conclusion(s): IMRT offers significant advantages over conventional RT and 3D-CRT techniques for treatment of maxillary sinus tumors. Good results can be obtained from 7 segments per beam without compromising the PTV coverage. This number of segments is practical for implementation in a busy RT department.

847,"Brain Radiation Induced Extracranial Abscopal Effects in Metastatic Melanoma Historically, the brain has been viewed as a specialized neurovascular inert organ with a distinctive immune privilege. Therefore, radiation-induced extracranial abscopal effects would be considered an unusual phenomenon due to the difficulty of the immunogenic signaling molecules to travel across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, it is now possible that localized central nervous system radiation has the ability to disrupt the structural integrity of the BBB and increase its endothelial permeability allowing the free passage of immunogenic responses between the intracranial and extracranial compartments. Thus, the nascent tumor-associated antigens produced by localized brain radiation can travel across the BBB into the rest of the body to modulate the immune system and induce extracranial abscopal effects. In clinical practice, localized brain radiation therapy-induced extracranial abscopal effects are a rarely seen phenomenon in metastatic melanoma and other advanced cancers. In this article, we provide a detailed overview of the current state of knowledge and clinical experience of central nervous system radiation-induced extracranial abscopal effects in patients with malignant melanoma. Emerging data from a small number of case reports and cohort studies of various malignancies has significantly altered our earlier understanding of this process by revealing that the brain is neither isolated nor passive in its interactions with the body's immune system. In addition, these studies provide clinical evidence that the brain is capable of interacting actively with the extracranial peripheral immune system. Thus, localized radiation treatment to 1 or more locations of brain metastases can induce extracranial abscopal responses. Collectively, these findings clearly demonstrate that localized brain radiation therapy-induced abscopal effects traverses the BBB and trigger tumor regression in the nonirradiated extracranial locations.",Excluded,0.7553817

708,"TopBP1 and Claspin contribute to the radioresistance of lung cancer brain metastases BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy is one of the most effective therapeutic tools for brain metastasis. However, it is inevitable that some cancer cells become resistant to radiation. This study is focused on the identification of genes associated with radioresistance in metastatic brain tumor from lung cancer and the functional examination of the selected genes with regards to altered sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation.METHODS: After establishing radioresistant cells from the xenograft model, we explored the significant transcriptional changes by performing DNA microarray profiling. Functional analyses in vitro and in vivo performed to validate the gene responsible for radioresistance.RESULTS: Transcriptional changes induced by radiation therapy are much more extensive in H460 cells than in PC14PE6 cells. The expression levels of TopBP1 and Claspin were increased in the cancer cells that survived radiation therapy. Depletion of TopBP1 or Claspin using shRNA showed an enhancement of sensitivity to radiation in radioresistant lung cancer cells (PC14PE6). Moreover, increased levels of TopBP1 or Claspin endowed cells a higher resistance to radiation. In xenograft models, the knock-down of TopBP1 or Claspin significantly prolonged the median survival time post radiation therapy.CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed the gene expression profiles of the radiosensitive cells and the radioresistant cells to define a set of genes that may be involved in endowing lung cancer cells radioresistance post brain metastasis. Functional analyses indicated that the expression TopBP1 and Claspin positively affects the survival of cancer cells and thus negatively the xenograft metastasis model animals in response to radiation.

255,"The effects of a spaceflight analog with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on sensorimotor adaptation Aboard the International Space Station (ISS), astronauts must adapt to altered vestibular and somatosensory inputs due to microgravity. Sensorimotor adaptation on Earth is often studied with a task that introduces visuomotor conflict. Retention of the adaptation process, known as savings, can be measured when subjects are exposed to the same adaptive task multiple times. It is unclear how adaptation demands found on the ISS might interfere with the ability to adapt to other sensory conflict at the same time. In the present study, we investigated the impact of 30 days' head-down tilt bed rest combined with elevated carbon dioxide (HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>) as a spaceflight analog on sensorimotor adaptation. Eleven subjects used a joystick to move a cursor to targets presented on a computer screen under veridical cursor feedback and 45degree rotated feedback. During this NASA campaign, five individuals presented with optic disk edema, a sign of spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). Thus, we also performed post hoc exploratory analyses between subgroups who did and did not show signs of SANS. HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> had some impact on sensorimotor adaptation, with a lack of savings across the whole group. SANS individuals showed larger, more persistent after-effects, suggesting a shift from relying on cognitive to more implicit processing of adaptive behaviors. Overall, these findings suggest that HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> alters the way in which individuals engage in sensorimotor processing. These findings have important implications for missions and mission training, which require individuals to adapt to altered sensory inputs over long periods in space. <b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This is the first bed rest campaign examining sensorimotor adaptation and savings in response to the combined effect of HDBR + CO2 and to observe signs of spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) in HDBR participants.

284,"Technical advances in x-ray microbeam radiation therapy In the last 25 years microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional radiation therapy at large, third generation synchrotrons. In MRT, a multi-slit collimator modulates a kilovoltage x-ray beam on a micrometer scale, creating peak dose areas with unconventionally high doses of several hundred Grays separated by low dose valley regions, where the dose remains well below the tissue tolerance level. Pre-clinical evidence demonstrates that such beam geometries lead to substantially reduced damage to normal tissue at equal tumour control rates and hence drastically increase the therapeutic window. Although the mechanisms behind MRT are still to be elucidated, previous studies indicate that immune response, tumour microenvironment, and the microvasculature may play a crucial role. Beyond tumour therapy, MRT has also been suggested as a microsurgical tool in neurological disorders and as a primer for drug delivery. The physical properties of MRT demand innovative medical physics and engineering solutions for safe treatment delivery. This article reviews technical developments in MRT and discusses existing solutions for dosimetric validation, reliable treatment planning and safety. Instrumentation at synchrotron facilities, including beam production, collimators and patient positioning systems, is also discussed. Specific solutions reviewed in this article include: dosimetry techniques that can cope with high spatial resolution, low photon energies and extremely high dose rates of up to 15 000 Gy s<sup>-1</sup>, dose calculation algorithms-apart from pure Monte Carlo Simulations-to overcome the challenge of small voxel sizes and a wide dynamic dose-range, and the use of dose-enhancing nanoparticles to combat the limited penetrability of a kilovoltage energy spectrum. Finally, concepts for alternative compact microbeam sources are presented, such as inverse Compton scattering set-ups and carbon nanotube x-ray tubes, that may facilitate the transfer of MRT into a hospital-based clinical environment. Intensive research in recent years has resulted in practical solutions to most of the technical challenges in MRT. Treatment planning, dosimetry and patient safety systems at synchrotrons have matured to a point that first veterinary and clinical studies in MRT are within reach. Should these studies confirm the promising results of pre-clinical studies, the authors are confident that MRT will become an effective new radiotherapy option for certain patients.",Excluded,0.7413634

The predicted neutron dose equivalent per therapeutic absorbed dose, H/D, was calculated at various locations representing clinically significant anatomical sites. Under typical treatment conditions, the average ratio of predicted-to-measured H/D is 1.8 in the gonadal region (50 cm from isocentre) and 3.4 in the thyroid region (21 cm from isocentre).

1131,"Radiation-induced brachial plexopathy in women treated for carcinoma of the breast OBJECTIVES: To study the clinical presentation and natural history of radiation-induced brachial plexopathy in 33 women treated for carcinoma of the breast.METHODS: All of the patients were referred to a single consultant neurologist. Details of surgical procedures, radiotherapy, symptoms at presentation and follow-up and neurological findings were recorded. Patients were reviewed at six or 12 monthly intervals for 2-19 years (median 9.5 years). Investigations included blood tests, chest X-ray, bone scan, neurophysiological studies, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine and cerebrospinal fluid examination.RESULTS: Symptoms began from six months to 20 years after radiotherapy (median time 1.5 years). Progressive weakness was universal and resulted in loss of any useful hand function in all but three patients. The time taken to loss of useful hand function ranged from six weeks to five years (median 1.25 years). Three patterns of upper limb weakness were identified, distal limb weakness only (13 patients), global limb weakness that was more marked distally (11 patients), and completely flaccid arm (10 patients). Seventeen patients required long-term morphine to palliate pain. A chemical sympathectomy benefited three patients.CONCLUSIONS: Most patients developed symptoms within three years, but late presentations 8-20 years later were encountered. Symptoms were progressive in all patients, though the rate did vary. Pain was common and persisted indefinitely in all but one patient. Morphine was effective and should be used early and in adequate doses. Chemical sympathectomy provided sustained relief in three of six patients.",Excluded,0.73919904

443,"[Biological effects and health risks of electromagnetic fields at levels classified by INCRIP ans admissible among occupationally exposed workers: a study of the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Lodz] The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of electromagnetic fields (EMF) on the workers' circulatory system, and to find out to what extent the EMF frequency, short-term (maximum values) and chronic (daily and lifetime doses) exposures influence the type of the observed disorders. The gathered data will help to evaluate whether hygiene standards that limit maximum admissible EMF values (e.g., ICNIRP standards) protect against adverse effects of exposure. The study covered workers employed in transformer and distribution stations, medium wave transmitting stations, radio-service and radio and TV multichannel broadcasting stations. In all the cases, exposure levels were considerably lower than those set as admissible according to the ICNIRP standards. Nevertheless changes in the circulatory system and a significant relationship between blood pressure and neurovegetative regulation disorders and exposure parameters were observed. The frequency of changes in the circulatory system was significantly dependent not only on the maximum EMF value, but also on its dose, which indicates that the hygiene standards for EMF cannot be limited only to short-term exposure maximum values, but they should be supplemented with dose-related standards.",Excluded,0.72792345

Materials/Methods: This is a single institution, retrospective review of 23 high risk medulloblastoma patients who were over 3 years old, had posterior fossa tumors, and had M+ disease. Six patients had M1 disease, 6 patients had M2 disease, and 11 patients had M3 disease. The median age at diagnosis of the 23 patients was 8 years (range, 3 - 15 years). The male/female patient ratio was 15:8. Patients were treated with concurrent chemotherapy and cranial spinal irradiation (3600 cGy), followed by boosts to gross disease or primary disease site of between 900 cGy to 1980 cGy. After radiation therapy patients were to be treated with chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 7.4 years (range, 0 - 15.2 years). Result(s): The 5-year and 10-year Kaplan-Meier estimated overall survival rate was 79% (+/- 19%, 95% confidence interval) and 57% (+/- 26%, 95% confidence interval). The 5-year and 10-year disease free survival and were 67% (+/- 22%, 95% confidence interval) and 50% (+/- 27%, 95% confidence interval), respectively. Eight patients had disease recurrences. The first sites of failure included 1 patient with distal supratentorial central nervous system recurrence, 4 patients with local recurrence, and 3 patients with leptomeningeal disease. Local recurrence did not correlate with subtotal resection or gross total resection. Conclusion(s): The treatment of high-risk medulloblastoma with standard-dose cranial spinal irradiation, and boost to tumor bed and gross disease and chemotherapy results in survival rates and primary site control rates comparable to or better than those in contemporary studies.

420,"Dental implants in radiated areas: A series of 33 patients. [French] Introduction. Prosthetic rehabilitation, particularly in radiated areas, can be particularly difficult in patients with partial or total edentation following treatment for orofacial cancer. We report a series of patients who underwent a protocol of implantation in radiated bone with evaluation of the prosthetic rehabilitation. Material and method. Thirty-three patients given radiotherapy for an orofacial cancer were implanted, followed by a dental prosthesis. The three phases of the protocol were a preoperative clinical and radiological analysis, a surgical phase under general anaesthesia and a postoperative clinical and radiological follow-up. Results. Fifteen patients were treated for an oral cavity tumor, ten for a pharyngeal lesion, six for a laryngeal tumor and two for a maxillary cancer. The average dose of radiotherapy was 60.5 Gy. Sixty-eight implants were positioned, 91.9% in the anterior mandible. The delay between radiotherapy and implantation was 54 months. The delay between implantation and loading was seven months. The average follow-up was 31.9 months. No peri-implantitis was observed. Discussion. Implantation in irradiated bone is possible if a strict protocol is used; a good rate of success and improved quality of life will favour development of this technique. Criteria for dental implant placement include local and general conditions, the psychological situation and technical possibilities. Sufficient delay after radiotherapy is necessary to verify healing and the good prognosis of the cancer. The vascular supply can be preserved by implantation under general anesthesia. All patients were satisfied with the functional and esthetic results. Â© Masson, 2006.",Excluded,0.71684074

220,"Fatty fish intake decrease multiple sclerosis risk among people exposed to low levels of ultraviolet radiation Background: The aim of this study was to estimate the relationship between intake of fatty fish and risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). Method(s): This study is based on the ongoing project Epidemiological Investigation of MS (EIMS) which is a population-based case-control study, comprising the general population aged 16-70 years in defined areas of Sweden. The present analysis involved 1404 incident cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) and 3097 controls, randomly selected from the study base, with consideration taken to age, gender, and residential area. The incidence of MS among people who reported high intake of fatty fish the last five years before inclusion in the study was compared with the incidence among people who reported low fatty fish intake. Adjustments were made for education level, smoking status, ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure habits, body mass index (BMI), vitamin D intake from dairy products and intake of lean fish. We performed sub group analyses stratifying for sun exposure habits, ancestry and gender. Finding(s): Subjects who reported fatty fish intake 1-7 times per week had a slightly decreased risk of multiple sclerosis compared with subjects who reported less intake of fatty fish (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-1.1). In subgroup analyses among subjects who reported low UVR exposure, frequent fatty fish intake significantly decreased the risk of multiple sclerosis (adjusted OR 0.6 (95 CI 0.5-0.9), whereas among subjects who reported high UVR exposure, this was not seen (adjusted OR 1.1 95% CI 0.8-1.4). Interpretation(s): Fatty fish intake seems to decrease multiple sclerosis risk among people with low UVR light exposure. A hypothetical explanation is that intake of fatty fish, with relatively high vitamin D content, is a substitute for lack of vitamin D due to low UVR exposure. This gives further strength to the hypothesis of the importance of vitamin D for the development of multiple sclerosis.

917,"The Association of Socioeconomic Status with the Burden of Cataract-related Blindness and the Effect of Ultraviolet Radiation Exposure: An Ecological Study Objective: To assess the association of socioeconomic status with the burden of cataract blindness in terms of year lived with disability (YLD) rates and to determine whether ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels modify the effect of socioeconomic status on this health burden.Methods: National and subnational age-standardized YLD rates associated with cataract-related blindness were derived from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2017. The human development index (HDI) from the Human Development Report was used as a measure of socioeconomic status. Estimated ground-level UVR exposure was obtained from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) dataset of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).Results: Across 185 countries, socioeconomic status was inversely associated with the burden of cataract blindness. Countries with a very high HDI had an 84% lower age-standardized YLD rate [95% confidence interval ( CI): 60%-93%, P < 0.001] than countries with a low HDI; for high-HDI countries, the proportion was 76% (95% CI: 53%-88%, P < 0.001), and for medium-HDI countries, the proportion was 48% (95% CI: 15%-68%, P = 0.010; P for trend < 0.001). The interaction analysis showed that UVR exposure played an interactive role in the association between socioeconomic status and cataract blindness burden ( P value for interaction = 0.047).Conclusion: Long-term high-UVR exposure amplifies the association of poor socioeconomic status with the burden of cataract-related blindness. The findings emphasize the need for strengthening UVR exposure protection interventions in developing countries with high-UVR exposure.",Excluded,0.7059594

Using a beam energy of 6 MV, two dose levels of 70 and 55.4 Gy were used to treat the tumour. Doses of 2 Gy in 35 fractions and 1.68 Gy in 33 fractions were simultaneously delivered for effective planning target volume (PTV1) and boost planning target volume (PTV2), respectively.Results Dose distribution in PTV and critical organs lies within tolerance dose guidelines protecting spinal cord, brain stem, optic chiasm, optic nerve, thus reducing the risk of damage to normal tissues. Minor deviation from tolerance limit was observed for parotid glands. This technique provided highly conformal and homogenous dose distribution as well as better sparing of OARs, hence verifying quality assurance results to be satisfactory.Findings SIB IMRT technique offers best solution for preserving organ function by keeping dose below tolerance level.

Bone Pain Trial Working Party AIM: To compare a single fraction of 8 Gy with a course of multifraction radiotherapy in terms of long-term benefits and short-term side effects in patients with painful skeletal metastases.METHODS: Seven hundred and sixty-five patients with painful skeletal metastases requiring palliative radiotherapy were entered into a prospective randomised clinical trial comparing 8 Gy single fraction with a multifraction regimen (20 Gy/5 fractions or 30 Gy/10 fractions). Patients recorded pain severity and analgesic requirements on self-assessment questionnaires before treatment, at 2 weeks and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12 months after radiotherapy. Pain relief was the primary endpoint of treatment benefit. Short-term side-effects were compared in a subset of 133 consecutive patients who graded nausea, vomiting and antiemetic usage prior to treatment and at daily intervals from days I to 14.RESULTS: Overall survival at 12 months was 44%, with no statistically significant difference apparent between randomised groups. There were no differences in the time to first improvement in pain, time to complete pain relief or in time to first increase in pain at any time up to 12 months from randomisation, nor in the class of analgesic used. Retreatment was twice as common after 8 Gy than after multifraction radiotherapy, although retreatment for residual or recurrent pain did not reflect a difference between randomised groups in the probability of pain relief. The difference in the rate of retreatment is thought to reflect a greater readiness to prescribe radiotherapy after a single fraction, not a greater need. There were no significant differences in the incidence of nausea, vomiting, spinal cord compression or pathological fracture between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: A single fraction of 8 Gy is as safe and effective as a multifraction regimen for the palliation of metastatic bone pain for at least 12 months. The greater convenience and lower cost make 8 Gy single fraction the treatment of choice for the majority of patients.",Excluded,0.6855674
527,"Urinary cytokines/chemokines pattern in patients with painful bone metastases undergoing external beam radiotherapy experiencing pain flare BACKGROUND: External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is a mainstay for treatment of painful bone metastases. Transient worsening of pain (""pain flare"") occurs in 40% of patients. We investigated the pathophysiology of pain flare through assessment of changes in urinary cytokines/chemokines in patients receiving EBRT for painful bone metastases.METHODS: Urine samples were collected from patients receiving a single 8 Gy fraction for painful bone metastases preparation, day 1 or 2 and on an additional day between days 3 to 5 post radiation. Patients completed a standardized pain and analgesic use diary daily for 10 days following radiation. Patients were deemed to have pain flare if they had a two-point increase from baseline worst pain on 0-10 scale and no decrease in analgesic intake or a 25% increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in worst pain. The Millipore Milliplex 42-Plex Cyto-kine/Chemokine Kit TM was used to measure urinary levels of a panel of cytokines/chemokines.RESULTS: Forty-six patients consented to the study of which 28 were evaluable (complete urine and diary data), and 83/84 urine samples were available for analysis. Pain flare was experienced by 11 patients (39%). The following cytokines/chemokines were detectable in at least 50% of the patients: EGF, fractalkine, GRO, IL-4, IL-8, interferon gamma induced protein 10 (IP-10), MCP-1, macrophage derived chemokine (MDC), PDGF-AA, sIL-2Ra, TGF-Alpha, VEGF. Comparing patients with or without pain flare EGF, fractalkine, GRO, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MDC, sIL-2Ra, and TGF-alpha increased following radiation in both groups. Patients with pain flare have significant lower levels on IL-8, IP-10, and MDC over time. No specific time trend was noticed.CONCLUSIONS: Patients who experience pain flare appear to have a different pattern in urinary cytokine/chemokine levels than patients without pain flare. A larger study is required to confirm the possible role of cytokines/chemokines in predisposition to and/or the cause of pain flare following radiation to painful bone metastases.",Excluded,0.68516284
429,"Neurotransmitter receptors in brain regions of acrylamide-treated rats. II: Effects of extended exposure to acrylamide Acrylamide was administered orally to 6 week old male rats in ten doses, spread over a two week period. At the two lower doses (5 and 10 mg/kg, total dose 50 and 100 mg/kg) effects on neurotransmitter receptor sites appeared confirmed to the striatum where both the dopamine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors exhibited enhanced binding twenty four hours after the last acrylamide dose. Other receptor sites within the frontal cortex, cerebellum, and medulla were not significantly altered. At the highest dose (20 mg/kg, given ten times), increases were also found for frontal cortical serotonin, medullary glycine, and cerebellar GABA receptor sites. The only unaffected receptor found was the cortical site for benzodiazepene. One week after the final acrylamide dose, the intensity of all ligands studied was not significantly different in treated and control groups. Thus, effects appeared reversible. Since striatal membrane protein concentration was reduced by treatment with rats with acrylamide, the observed increase in activity of muscarinic receptors could be best accounted for in terms of loss of striatal non-receptor protein rather than increased binding. However, the magnitude of increased striatal <sup>3</sup>H-spiroperidol binding in treated animals suggested an increase in overall binding capacity. An effect on dopamine neutrons was also suggested by a decreased responsiveness to apomorphine in rats treated with acrylamide at 10 mg/kg for 10 successive days; however, the effect had dissipated by 8 days after the final injection of acrylamide.",Excluded,0.67609936

Controls answered the questionnaire and underwent straylight measurement and (in a random one-sixth sample) cataract grading.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Retinal straylight levels and subjective visual symptoms.RESULTS: Among 230 LPI-treated subjects (121 [58.8%] with LPI totally covered by the lid, 43 [19.8%] with LPI partly covered by the lid, 53 [24.4%] with LPI uncovered by the lid), 217 (94.3%) completed all testing, as did 250 (93.3%) of 268 controls. Age, gender, and prevalence of visual symptoms did not differ between treated subjects and controls, although nuclear (P<0.01) and cortical (P = 0.03) cataract were less common among controls. Neither presenting visual acuity nor straylight score differed between the treated and untreated eyes among all treated persons, nor among those (n = 96) with LPI partially or totally uncovered. Prevalence of subjective glare did not differ significantly between participants with totally covered LPI (6.61%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.39%-12.5%), partially covered LPI (11.6%; 95% CI, 5.07%-24.5%), or totally uncovered LPI (9.43%; 95% CI, 4.10%-10.3%). In regression models, only worse cortical cataract grade (P = 0.01) was associated significantly with straylight score, and no predictors were associated with subjective glare. None of the LPI size or location parameters were associated with straylight or subjective symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggests that LPI is safe regarding measures of straylight and visual symptoms.

The diameter of the gamma beams is confined by collimator systems and available collimator sizes are 4, 8, 14 and 18 mm. The reduction in dose rate for each collimator helmet is called the output factor (OPF). Experimental determination of OPFs is difficult due to the extremely narrow beams for which the dose is determined. In the present work, the PRESTA version of the EGS4 Monte Carlo code was used to obtain relative OPFs for the Leksell Gamma Knife for collimator sizes of 14, 8 and 4 mm (relative to that of the 18 mm collimator).

385,"A novel small molecule inhibitor of MRCK prevents radiation driven invasion in glioblastoma Purpose or Objective Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and incurable primary brain tumour that causes severe neurological, cognitive and psychological symptoms. Symptoms are caused and/or exacerbated by the infiltrative properties of GBM cells, which enable them to pervade the healthy brain, disrupting normal function. Recent research has indicated that, while radiotherapy extends life expectancy of patients, it can provoke a more infiltrative phenotype in those GBM cells that survive treatment. In this study we investigate the role of the actin-myosin regulatory kinase, MRCK, in radiation driven infiltration by GBM cells and probe its potential as an anti-invasive target using a novel MRCK specific inhibitor. Material and Methods In vitro motility assays with single cell tracking were used to measure the migration speed of GBM cells on a petri dish. The results were confirmed using an ex vivo assay that uses confocal time-lapse microscopy and single cell tracking to measure the speed of GBM cells migrating through fresh murine brain slices Biomarker response was measure via immuno-blotting, immuno-fluorescence and immuno-histochemistry. In vivo experiments utilised a intracranial xenograft model using a primary GBM cell line. Mice were irradiated using a Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP, Xstrahl). Results GBM cells classically adopt a mesenchymal mode of cell invasion, characterised by an elongated cell body and actin-rich protrusions. Mesenchymal migration requires the activation of the actin-myosin regulatory kinase, MRCK, and consequent phosphorylation of the downstream effectors MLC2 and MYPT1. By measuring relative phosphorylation levels of the MRCK biomarkers, pMLC2 and pMYPT1, we demonstrate that MRCK activity is enhanced at the invasive edges of GBM tumours and is further enhanced by irradiation both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that this response is essential to the phenomenon of radiation induced migration of GBM cells in vitro through MRCK targeted RNAi. Crucially, we were also able to fully abrogate radiation driven invasion in vivo by using a novel small molecule inhibitor, BDP-9066, to specifically target MRCK in a clinically relevant intracranial mouse model of GBM. These data confirm the pivotal role of MRCK in radiation driven infiltration. We are currently undertaking an experiment to investigate whether the anti-invasive effects of BDP-9066 translate into increased survival in our intracranial GBM model, and therefore further validate MRCK as a potential antiinvasive therapeutic target in GBM. Conclusion In conclusion, we have identified a novel and highly promising anti-invasive therapeutic target in GBM, MRCK, which in combination with existing standard of care for glioblastoma, has the potential to improve outcomes for this cancer of unmet need.",Excluded,0.6344721

717,"Pain flare following external beam radiotherapy and meaningful change in pain scores in the treatment of bone metastases BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To examine the incidence of pain flare following external beam radiotherapy and to determine what constitutes a meaningful change in pain scores in the treatment of bone metastases.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with bone metastases treated with external beam radiotherapy were asked to score their pain on a scale of 0-10 before the treatment (baseline), daily during the treatment and for 10 days after completion of external beam radiation. Pain flare was defined as a two-point increase from baseline pain in the pain scale of 0-10 with no decrease in analgesic intake or a 25% increase in analgesic intake employing daily oral morphine equivalent with no decrease in pain score. To distinguish pain flare from progression of pain, we required the pain score and analgesic intake to return back to baseline levels after the increase/flare. They were also asked to indicate if their pain changed during that time compared to pre-treatment level. The change in pain score was compared with patient perception.RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were evaluated in this study. There were 49 male and 39 female patients with the median age of 70 years. Twelve of 88 patients (14%) had pain flare on day 1. The overall incidence of pain flare during the study period ranged from 2 to 16%. A total of 797 pain scorings were obtained. Patients perceived an improvement in pain when their self-reported pain score decreased by at least two points.CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the occurrence of pain flare following the external beam radiotherapy in the treatment of bone metastases. Further studies are required to predict who are at risk for flare. Appropriate measures can be taken to alleviate the pain flare. The finding in the meaningful change in pain scores supports the investigator-defined partial response used in some clinical trials.",Excluded,0.6184183

The CI (IMRT) was inversely proportional to the size of the PTV (Spearman's rho = -0.53, p = 0.01) and at PTV sizes above 25 cm3, the CI (IMRT) was always superior to CI (DA) and CI (CF). At PTV sizes below 25 cm3, there was no significant difference in CI between each technique. There was no significant difference in HI between plans. The total volume of normal tissue receiving 50.4, 44.8, and 5.6 Gy was significantly lower when comparing IMRT to CF and DA plans (p < 0.05). There was significantly improved dose sparing for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe with IMRT but no significant difference for the optic chiasm or pituitary gland. These results demonstrate that stereotactic IMRT should be considered to treat base-of-skull meningiomas with a PTV larger than 25 cm3, due to improved conformity and normal tissue sparing, in particular for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe.",Excluded,0.5962606
705,"Heterogeneous expression of Ku70 in human tissues is associated with morphological and functional alterations of the nucleus Ku70 is a subunit of DNA-protein kinase complex and involved in diverse intranuclear events including the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. Ku70 is rich in the interphase nucleus of cultured cells. In human tissues, however, the distribution of Ku70 has not yet been systematically examined. To characterize the difference of Ku70 distribution between cells of human tissues and cultured cells, the expression of Ku70 was examined in various normal and neoplastic human tissues by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot. In addition, the role of Ku70 in the cellular response against ionizing radiation (IR) was analysed in fibroblasts after exposure to 5 Gy IR and apoptotic indices were examined in Ku70-overexpressed fibroblasts from an ataxia telangiectasia patient and in normal fibroblasts, before and after irradiation. In contrast to cultured cells, Ku70 was not detected in some interphase cells of human tissues and was distributed heterogeneously, even in the same nucleus. Ku70 expression was strikingly low in terminally differentiated cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils, glomerular capillary endothelial cells and fibroblasts, and was absent in spermatids. In spermatocytes, Ku70 was tightly integrated with chromosome filaments, unlike other somatic cells under mitosis. After exposure to IR, Ku70 expression was not increased in ataxia telangiectasia fibroblasts, but was significantly increased in normal fibroblasts. Most of the increased Ku70 was of soluble nuclear protein fraction. Furthermore, overexpression of Ku70 increased radiation resistance both in ataxia telangiectasia fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts. The presented data indicate that the distribution of Ku70 in cells of human tissues is closely associated with the cell cycle, cellular differentiation, nuclear shape and the process of repair of DNA damage caused by IR.",Excluded,0.5895703
170,"Dosimetric predictive factors for radiation pneumonitis in sterotactic body radiotherapy Purpose/Objective: To investigate the correlation of lung dose volume parameters with radiation pneumonitis (RP) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pulmonary metastases treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Material(s) and Method(s): From January 2006 to January 2014, 72 patients with primary or metastatic lung tumors underwent SBRT with total dose of 40 Gy (47.22%) and 50 Gy (52.78%) in 5 fractions with Linac or Tomotherapy. The dose was prescribed to the isocenter, the fractionation schedule has been chosen according to diameter and location of the lesion (central vs peripheral). 54/72 (75%) patients had primary lung cancer and 18/72 (25%) patients had solitary secondary lung lesion. Dosimetric factors were extracted from the dose-volume histogram (DVH). PTV consisted of GTV plus 1 cm in cranial-caudal direction and 0.5 cm in others directions; after installation of Tomotherapy, expansion was 0.5 cm in all directions. Median tumor diameter was 20 mm (range 10-60) and 11 mm (5-22), median GTV was 5.87 cc (0.88-27.90) and 3.34 cc (0.33-9.07), median PTV was 28.48 cc (2.7-133.8) and 14.785 cc (7.3-113.3) for primary and secondary lung cancer, respectively. Response was evaluated with CT and/or FDG-PET imaging 3-4 months after the end of SBRT and every 4-6 months thereafter. Toxicity was evaluated according to CTCAE v3.0. We retrospectively analyzed clinical, treatment-related and dosimetric factors. Factors including total radiation dose, site of lesion, diameter, GTV, PTV, V5, V10, V20, V30 and mean lung dose (MLD) of ipsilateral lung were considered in order to evaluate the development of RP using the Cox proportional hazards model. The predictive accuracy for RP was assessed by using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis to define the cut-off points for significant parameters. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 20.5 months (range 4 - 91) and 18 months (14-80) for primary and secondary lung cancer. RP G1-2 has been observed in 23/54 patients (42.59%); no pulmonary toxicity >G2 has occurred, as there has been no toxicity of controlateral lung and other organs at risk. Univariate statistical analysis showed that GTV(p=0.036), PTV (p=0.022), MLD (p=0.003) and V5 (p=0.002), V10 (p=0.002), V20 (p=0.012), V30 (p=0.002) were significant variables for the risk of developing RP. Multivariate statistical analysis has found that the predictor variables of RP are V5 (p=0.004), V10 (p=0.009), V20 (p=0.014), V30 (p=0.007) and the MLD (p=0.011). The greatest risk was connected to the variable V30 (HR 1.985 ). On the ROC curve, the cut-off values of ipsilateral lung V5,V10,V20,V30 and MLD were 29.50%,19.50%,9.55%,4.58% and 4.7%, respectively (Fig.1). A cutoff of 4.58% for V30 had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 82.1%.

165,"Does the Gamma Knife dose rate affect outcomes in radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia? OBJECT: The object of this study was to determine whether the radiation dose rate affects clinical outcomes in patients who undergo stereotactic Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) to manage typical trigeminal neuralgia (TN).METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied pain relief in 165 patients with medically intractable TN, who underwent 80-Gy GKS using a single 4-mm collimator between 1994 and 2005. No patient had received prior radiation treatment. The measured relative helmet output factor of the Gamma Knife was 0.8 throughout this interval, and the dose rate varied from 1.21 Gy/minute to 3.74 Gy/minute (median 2.06 Gy/minute). Irradiation time varied from 26.73 to 95.11 minutes. The authors divided patients into a low-dose-rate (LDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 1.21 to 2.05 Gy/minute, and a high-dose-rate (HDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 2.06 to 3.74 Gy/minute. Post-GKS, the patients' pain control was determined using the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain scale. There was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to history of prior microvascular decompression (p = 0.410) or peripheral neuroablative procedures (p = 0.583). The length of symptoms in patients varied from 3 to 414 months with a median of 84 months (p = 0.698). Median follow-up was 26 months with a maximum of 139 months.RESULTS: Initial pain relief was obtained in 71% of patients in the LDR group and 78% in the HDR group (p = 0.547). Patients who initially obtained improved pain relief (BNI Scores I-IIIa) after GKS maintained pain control for median durations of 52 months (LDR group) and 54 months (HDR group) (p = 0.403). New or increased facial sensory dysfunction was found in 14.5% of patients in the LDR group and in 19.3% of patients in the HDR group (p = 0.479).CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that the GKS dose rate did not affect pain control or morbidity within the range of 1.21-3.74 Gy/minute. Cobalt 60 source decay did not affect outcomes of GKS for TN pain management, even for dose rates approximating a 2-half-life decay of the isotope.",Excluded,0.5784353
523,"Tumor stage dependent contribution of bone marrow derived cells to tumor neo-vascularization Introduction: The role of bone marrow derived cells (BMDC) in tumor neo-vascularization remains controversial. We have previously demonstrated that BMDC contribute to tumor neovascularization by differentiating into vascular support cells and not endothelial cell. In this study we focus on establishing the spatiotemporal role of BMDC in tumor neovascularisation, focusing on whether it is a tumor growth stage dependent process and more specifically examining the patterns of BMDC integration into tumor vasculature in response to radiation therapy (RTx). Method(s): Animal Models: Bone marrow of NOD/SCID mice were stably reconstituted with BM harvested from green-fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice. Intracranial (ic) xenografts were generated in intracranial window models (ICW) using a panel of glioma cell and breast cancer cells stably expressing mCherry. In-vivo imaging: Two-photon laser capture microscopy was used to obtain high-resolution real-time in-vivo longitudinal images of the tumor cells, tumor vasculature and tracing of the circulating GFP+BM cells. Mice were imaged 1d,2d,3d,7d,10d,14d,21d & <sup>30</sup>d following cell implantation or RTx. Brain Tumor Analysis: Mice were sacrificed using perfusion fixation and brains collected for correlative immunohistochemical and Immunofluorscent confocal analysis. RTx: Using in-house designed x-ray micro-irradiator stereotactic radiation was delivered through ICW to ic-xenografts, treated with either 3x2Gy or 3x5Gy. Tumor+RTx was compared to RTx alone or tumor alone (n=15 each arm). Result(s): At early stages of tumor formation (<1wk) there is 90% integration of BMDC into the tumor vasculature, while to late stages of tumor growth (>2 wks) only 10% integration of BMDC is seen. At later stages of tumor growth (>2 wks) BMDC incorporation in the tumor vasculature is predominantly seen in the tumor periphery compared to the tumor centre, with the peripheral vessels demonstrating almost 100% integration of BMDC compared to the centre of the tumor where the vasculature have no integration of BMDC. Conclusion(s): Our results are the first to demonstrate that there is a specific tumor growth stage dependent contribution of BMDC to tumor neo-vascularization. At early stages of tumor growth neo-ascularization relies on host BMDC, while at later stages of tumor growth vascularization relies on branching of pre-existing vessels. A significant difference in extent of BMDC integration is noted between periphery versus the centre of the tumor, suggesting that the internal tumor micro-environment regulates neoascularization differently from the periphery. Intriguingly, this distinction is not seen with tumor neovascularization in recurrent tumors following RTx. These results have significant therapeutic implications and point to a need for scheduling of anti-angiogenic therapies according to tumor growth stage and timing post RTx.",Excluded,0.57039165
618,"Local tumor control after retreatment of spinal metastasis using stereotactic body radiotherapy; comparison with initial treatment group BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate local control rates after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in recurrent spinal metastasis after external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and new spinal metastatic lesions.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records and radiological data was performed on 54 retreatment and 131 initial SBRT patients. To compare various fractionation schedules, the biologically effective dose (BED) was applied. SBRT dose was calculated with linear-quadratic model and normalized to a 2-Gy equivalent dose (nBED, alpha/beta =2 Gy for spinal cord, alpha/beta =10 Gy for tumor). Doses to a point within the spinal cord that received the maximum dose (Pmax) were checked. Local control failure was defined as progression by imaging study. Overall survival, progression free survival, delivered radiation dose to tumor and spinal cord, and spinal cord Pmax nBED were compared in two groups.RESULTS: The mean delivered radiation doses to tumor margin during SBRT were 51.1 Gy2/10 (retreatment) and 50.7 Gy2/10 (initial treatment). Mean survival was 29.6 months (overall)/20.7 months (retreatment)/ 32.4 months (initial treatment). Mean progression free period was 23.9 months (overall)/18.0 months (retreatment)/ 26.0 months (initial treatment). Radiological control rates of retreatment and initial treatment group were 96%/95% at six months, 81%/89% at 12 months and 79%/90% at 24 months. Among 54 retreatment lesions, 13 lesions showed local control failure during follow-up. With regard to spinal cord radiation dose during SBRT, Spinal cord Pmax nBED was 46.2 Gy2/2 (retreatment) and 48.7 Gy2/2 (initial treatment). In retreatment group, total nBED to spinal cord was a mean of 83.4 Gy2/2. There was no case of radiation myelopathy detected.CONCLUSIONS: Retreatment of spinal metastases using SBRT provided effective local control without neurological complications.",Excluded,0.55900776

Rehabilitation programmes are used for long-term management of disease. Spa therapy is often integrated in various middle and south European and Asian countries. Here, we investigated radon spa therapy as applied in health resorts compared to a control intervention in rheumatic out-patients. Randomised, blinded trial enroling 681 patients [mean age 58.3 (standard deviation 11.1); female 59.7%] in 7 health resorts in Germany and Austria with chronic back pain (n 1 = 437), osteoarthritis (OA) (n 2 = 230), rheumatoid arthritis (n 3 = 98), and/or ankylosing spondylitis (n 4 = 39); multiple nominations in 146 cases). Outcomes were pain (primary), quality of life, functional capacity, and medication measured before start, after end of treatment, and 3 times thereafter in 3 monthly intervals. Adverse events were documented. To analyse between-group differences, repeated-measures analysis of covariance was performed in metric endpoints and Fisher's exact test in rates. Two-sided significance level of 5% was chosen. Until end of follow-up, superiority of radon therapy was found regarding pain relief (p = 0.032) and analgesic drug consumption (p = 0.007), but not regarding quality of life. Functional capacity was assessed specific to the underlying indication. Significant benefits were found in radon-treated OA patients until 6-month follow-up (p = 0.05), but not until end of study (p = 0.096). Neither the back pain sub-population nor the two smaller patient populations with inflammatory indications benefited significantly in functional capacity.

[Russian] The authors assess the efficacy of brachytherapy of uveal melanomas in 954 patients. Strontium ophthalmoapplicators were used in 652, rutenium ones in 302 patients. As a rule, Sr applicators were sutured in patients with tumors up to 3.5 mm thick and Ru ones in cases with tumors thicker than 3.5 mm. A special program was used for individual approach and improving the accuracy of planning. A total of 74.5% of patients have been followed up for at least 3 years, with check-ups every 3-6 months. The effect of brachytherapy was considered positive in cases with complete resorption or at least 50% decrease of the tumor and a stable clinical picture for 9-12 months. In 60% of patients the tumor regressed completely, in 16% partially, and in 24% there were signs of activation of melanoma growth one year after treatment. The frequency of radiation complications was as follows: retinopaty, 3.15%; neuroretinopathy, 1.1%; hemophthalmia, 0.9%; neovascular glaucoma, 1.1%; cataract, 0.63%. The incidence of radiation complications increases with increase of the applicator power and rigidity of exposure.

We have previously published a new method to derive pCT images from head T1-weighted (T1-w) MR images using a single-atlas propagation scheme followed by a post hoc correction of the mapped CT numbers using local intensity information. The purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of our method with head zero echo time (ZTE) MR images. To evaluate results, the mean absolute error in bins of 20 HU was calculated with respect to the true planning CT scan of the patient. We demonstrated that applying our method using ZTE MR images instead of T1-w improved the correctness of the pCT in case of bone resection surgery prior to RT (that is, an example of large anatomical difference between the atlas and the patient).",Excluded,0.5298797

Radiation therapy (RT) has proven effective in bone (BM) and brain (BrM) metastases. The objective of this study was to analyze the variability of RT utilization rates in clinical practice and the accessibility to medical technology in our region.Patients and methods: We reviewed the clinical records and RT treatment sheets of all patients undergoing RT for BM and/or BrM during 2007 in the 12 public hospitals in an autonomous region of Spain. Data were gathered on hospital type, patient type and RT treatment characteristics. Calculation of the rate of RT use was based on the cancer incidence and the number of RT treatments for BM, BrM and all cancer sites. Result(s): Out of the 9319 patients undergoing RT during 2007 for cancer at any site, 1242 (13.3%; inter-hospital range, 26.3%) received RT for BM (n = 744) or BrM (n = 498). These 1242 patients represented 79% of all RT treatments with palliative intent, and the most frequent primary tumours were in lung, breast, prostate or digestive system. No significant difference between BM and BrM groups were observed in: mean age (62 vs. 59 yrs, respectively); gender (approximately 64% male and 36% female in both); performance status (ECOG 0-1 in 70 vs. 71%); or mean distance from hospital (36 vs. 28.6 km) or time from consultation to RT treatment (13 vs. 14.3 days). RT regimens differed among hospitals and between patient groups: 10 x 300 cGy, 5 x 400 cGy and 1x800cGy were applied in 32, 27 and 25%, respectively, of BM patients, whereas 10 x 300cGy was used in 49% of BrM patients. Conclusion(s): Palliative RT use in BM and BrM is high and close to the expected rate, unlike the global rate of RT application for all cancers in our setting. Differences in RT schedules among hospitals may reflect variability in clinical practice among the medical teams. Â© 2012 Exposito et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded,0.5224545
901,"Toxicity profile of spine stereotactic radiosurgery among long-term survivors Purpose/Objective(s): To characterize toxicity risk profiles in long-term survivors (>4 years) after spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS). Long-term oncologic control outcomes have been previously reported. This study represents the largest series reporting long-term toxicity profiles after SSRS. Materials/Methods: From December 2002 to June 2011, 228 patients with 261 segments were treated with spine stereotactic radiosurgery for metastatic disease. A subset cohort of 53 patients with 59 segments survived a minimum of 4 years after treatment and was analyzed for radiation associated toxicity. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiation morbidity scoring criteria and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0 were used to grade myelopathy, myelitis, radiculopathy, and fracture. Toxicity endpoints occurring in the setting of tumor progression were not attributed to treatment effect. Toxicity development was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Patients were followed clinically and radiographically for a median of 5.6 years (range 49-110 months). SSRS fractionation schemes were 24 Gy in 1 fraction (25%), 18 Gy in 1 fraction (19%), 27 Gy in 3 fractions (32%), 30 Gy in 5 fractions (11%), 16 Gy in 1 fraction (11%), or 22 Gy in 1 fraction (2%). There were 6 sites treated which received prior conventional radiation (10.2%). Three patients (5%) required additional surgery due to tumor progression while 8 (13.6%) received additional palliative radiation. Long-term treatment related toxicity events included one case of Grade 4 myelopathy resulting in hemi-cord syndrome (1.7%), which occurred 13 months after therapy. Sensory radiculopathy occurred in 5 cases (8.5%) at a median of 12.8 months (range 2.5-25.4), of which, 2 required intrathecal pain pumps for symptom management. Eight treated segments (13.6%) involving 7 patients developed vertebral body collapse and/or endplate fracture at a median 7.5 months (range 0.6-49.2) with 6 (10.2%) requiring either percutaneous vertebroplasty or surgery. Overall, in this subset cohort of long-term survivors, a toxicity event was observed in 15 cases (25%) of which 9 (15%) were at least grade 3. The majority of events (53%) were vertebral fracture. Forty percent of toxicity occurred beyond 12 months of therapy (median 10 months) with events being observed beyond 2 years (radiculopathy) and even 4 years (vertebral fracture) later. Combined grade 3+ neurological toxicity occurred in 5.6% of long-term survivors at a median of 12.7 months after treatment. Conclusion(s): Spine stereotactic radiosurgery appears to have a favorable late toxicity profile even amongst a selected cohort of long-term survivors. The overwhelming majority of events occur within 2 years of treatment. Very late toxicity beyond 4 years occurred in 1/59 treated sites and consisted of a vertebral body fracture.

939,"Muscles in microgravity: from fibres to human motion In simulated or actual microgravity, human and animal postural muscles undergo substantial atrophy: after about 270 days, the muscle mass attains a constant value of about 70% of the initial one. Most animal studies reported preferential atrophy of slow twitch fibres whose mechanical properties change towards the fast type. However, in humans, at the end of a 42-days bed rest study, a similar atrophy of slow and fast fibres was observed. After microgravity, the maximal force of several muscle groups showed a substantial decrease (6-25% of pre-flight values). The maximal power during very short ""explosive"" efforts of 0.25-0.30s showed an even greater fall, being reduced to 65% after 1 month and to 45% (of pre-flight values) after 6 months. The maximal power developed during 6-7s ""all-out"" bouts on an isokinetic cycloergometer was reduced to a lesser extent, attaining about 75% of pre-flight values, regardless of the flight duration. In these same subjects, the muscle mass of the lower limbs declined by only 9-13%. Thus, a substantial fraction of the observed decreases of maximal power is probably due to a deterioration of the motor co-ordination brought about by the absence of gravity. To prevent this substantial decay of maximal absolute power, we propose that explosive exercise be added to the daily in-flight training schedule. We also describe a system aimed at reducing cardiovascular deconditioning wherein gravity is simulated by the centrifugal acceleration generated by the motion of two counter rotating bicycles ridden by the astronauts on the inner wall of a cylindrical space module. Finally, cycling on circular or elliptical tracks may be useful to reduce cardiovascular deconditioning in permanently manned lunar bases. Indeed, on the curved parts of the path, a cyclist generates an outward acceleration vector (ac). To counterbalance ac, the cyclist must lean inwards, so that the vectorial sum of ac plus the lunar gravity tends to the acceleration of gravity prevailing on Earth.",Excluded,0.51955014

Our institution has adopted the use of volumetric arc therapy (VMAT) due to superior sparing of the adjacent organs at risk (OARs) compared to intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Here we report our clinical experience by analyzing target coverage and sparing of OARs for 90 clinical treatment plans. Method(s): VMAT and IMRT patient cohorts comprising 45 patients each were included in this study. For all patients, the planning target volume (PTV) received 50Gy in 30 fractions, and the simultaneous integrated boost PTV received 60Gy. The characteristics of the two patient cohorts were examined for similarity. The doses to target volumes and OARs, including brain, brainstem, hippocampi, optic nerves, eyes, and cochleae were then compared using statistical analysis. Target coverage and normal tissue sparing for six patients with both clinical IMRT and VMAT plans were analyzed. Result(s): PTV coverage of at least 95% was achieved for all plans, and the median mean dose to the boost PTV differed by only 0.1Gy between the IMRT and VMAT plans. Superior sparing of the brainstem was found with VMAT, with a median difference in mean dose being 9.4Gy. The ipsilateral cochlear mean dose was lower by 19.7Gy, and the contralateral cochlea was lower by 9.5Gy. The total treatment time was reduced by 5min. The difference in the ipsilateral hippocampal D<inf>100%</inf> was 12Gy, though this is not statistically significant (P=0.03). Conclusion(s): VMAT for GBM patients can provide similar target coverage, superior sparing of the brainstem and cochleae, and be delivered in a shorter period of time compared with IMRT. The shorter treatment time may improve clinical efficiency and the quality of the treatment experience. Based on institutional clinical experience, use of VMAT for the treatment of GBMs appears to offer no inferiority in comparison to IMRT and may offer distinct advantages, especially for patients who may require re-irradiation.

Median confidence in a medical evaluation without ancillary testing was 20 (95% confidence interval [CI] 16 to 25) compared with 90 (95% CI 88 to 91) when laboratory testing and CT were included. More than 70% of participants underestimated the radiation dose of CT relative to chest radiography, and cancer risk comprehension was poor. Median agreement with the Hiroshima statement was 13 (95% CI 10 to 16) and 45 (95% CI 40 to 45) with the increased lifetime cancer risk statement. Seven hundred ninety-five patients reported receiving a previous CT. Of 365 patients who reported no previous CT, 142 (39%) had one documented in our electronic medical record.CONCLUSION: Patients are more confident when CT imaging is part of their medical evaluation but have a poor understanding of the concomitant radiation exposure and risk and underestimate their previous imaging experience.",Excluded,0.50660294
248,"Results of hyperfractionated radiation therapy used in combination with lomustin in malignant gliomas of the brain. [Russian] The postoperative use of lomustin, a nitrosourea agent, was investigated for its impact on the efficiency of hyperfractionated radiation therapy performed in patients with glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma of the brain. A total of 35 patients (26 and 9 patients with glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma, respectively) were followed up. Radiation therapy was performed, by using a total focal dose of 65 Gy in 2 steps or a single dose of 1.25 Gy twice daily every 4-6 hours. The patients received lomustin in a single oral dose of 160-200 mg at each of 2 stages of a hyperfractionated course of radiation therapy. The interval between two successive administrations was 5 weeks. Lomustin in combination with hyperfractionated radiation therapy was found to have no effect on the survival of patients with glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma.",Excluded,0.50650746
623,"Enhanced responses of rat dorsal horn neurons after UV irradiation of the hindpaw; roles of the NMDA receptor Recordings were made from nociceptive dorsal horn neurones in the anaesthetized rat 3 and 5 days after ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of the hindpaw. The electrically evoked A beta-fibre-evoked responses from the paw were enhanced and their thresholds were lowered. Spontaneous neuronal activity was increased but the C-fibre-evoked responses were unaltered. These enhanced responses, suggestive of allodynia, were reduced by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) antagonism.",Excluded,0.5018947
