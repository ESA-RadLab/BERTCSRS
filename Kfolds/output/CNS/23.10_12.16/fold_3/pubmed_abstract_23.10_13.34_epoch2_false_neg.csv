1207,"[Influence of electromagnetic radiation on raf kinase inhibitor protein and its related proteins of hippocampus]. [Chinese] To study the development of changes for Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) and its mRNA in rats hippocampus after electromagnetic radiation. Rats were exposed to X-band high power microwave (X-HPM), S-band high power microwave (S-HPM) and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) radiation source respectively. The animal model of electromagnetic radiation was established. Western blot was used to detect the expression of RKIP, and RT-PCR was applied to detect the expression of RKIP mRNA. The interaction of RKIP and Raf-1 was measured with co-immunoprecipitation method, and the expression of cerebral choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) was measured by immunohistochemistry. The expression of RKIP significantly down-regulated at 6 h after radiation, and recovered at 1 d in group EMP, but the down-regulation continued during 1 approximately 7 d after radiation in the two microwave groups. The expression of RKIP mRNA changed wavily during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, which showed down-regulation at 6 h, and up-regulation at 3 d. The interaction of RKIP and Raf-1 decreased during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, most significantly at 7 d, and the two microwave groups were more significant. The expression of CHAT decreased continuously during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, and generally recovered on 14 d. The down-regulation of RKIP and its related proteins of hippocampus is induced by electromagnetic radiation.",Included,0.0395874
380,"Effect of Protons on GABA<inf>A</inf> Receptors in Central Neurons of Various Types Whole-cell patch-clamp technique was employed to record chloride ionic current I<inf>GABA</inf> evoked by fast (600 msec) application of GABA to hippocampal pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells isolated from rat brain. GABA solution in the application pipette was either neutral (pH 7.4) or acidic (pH 7.0 or 6.0). Application of protons to neurons causes a rapid, reversible, and dose-dependent decrease in the amplitude of I<inf>GABA</inf>; the effect was more pronounced on hippocampal neurons (carrying both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA<inf>A</inf> receptors) than in cerebellar Purkinje cells (predominantly equipped with synaptic GABA<inf>A</inf> receptors). In hippocampal neurons, pharmacological isolation of extrasynaptic component from total I<inf>GABA</inf> was performed with GABA<inf>A</inf> receptor antagonist gabazine (50 nM). The extrasynaptic component of I<inf>GABA</inf> was stronger blocked by protons than total I<inf>GABA</inf>. It was concluded that acidic medium produced more potent blocking effect on extrasynaptic GABA<inf>A</inf> receptors than on synaptic ones.

97,"Nonvestibular schwannomas: an evaluation of functional outcome after radiosurgical and microsurgical management PURPOSE: Nonvestibular cranial nerve schwannomas (NVCNS) are relatively rare tumors. We evaluated our experience with radiosurgical and microsurgical treatment alone and in combination for the management of NVCNS.METHODS: The charts of 62 patients with NVCNS who were treated between 1993 and 2005 at our institution were reviewed. Patients diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 2 were excluded. The patients underwent microsurgery and/or radiosurgery treatment.RESULTS: Trigeminal and jugular foramen schwannomas were the most common NVCNS tumors (n = 47), and the only two groups with sufficient numbers of patients to allow comparison of the three treatment approaches. In these two groups, the mean tumor volume was significantly higher in those who received combined therapy (8.59 +/- 2.29 cc), compared with radiosurgery (4.94 +/- 3.02 cc; p = 0.05) or microsurgery alone (5.38 +/- 3.23; p = 0.027). Patients who underwent radiosurgery alone were significantly older (67.7 +/- 13.3 years; p = 0.019) than those treated with microsurgery (55.3 +/- 13.7 years) or with both modalities (48.7 +/- 12.8 years). The Karnofsky Performance Scale scores were significantly higher (p < or = 0.05) at follow-up compared with baseline for all three treatment approaches. There was no significant change in the Glasgow Outcome scores before and after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgery and radiosurgery can both be used to manage NVCNS tumors with excellent results. When treatment with either modality alone is not reasonable, tumors can be managed effectively with combined micro- and radiosurgery treatment.",Included,0.039892472

1197,"Angiographic features, collaterals, and infarct topography of symptomatic occlusive radiation vasculopathy: a case-referent study BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Occlusive radiation vasculopathy (ORV) predisposes head-and-neck cancer survivors to ischemic strokes.METHODS: We analyzed the digital subtraction angiography acquired in 96 patients who had first-ever transient ischemic attack or ischemic strokes attributed to ORV. Another age-matched 115 patients who had no radiotherapy but symptomatic high-grade (>70%) carotid stenoses were enrolled as referent subjects. Digital subtraction angiography was performed within 2 months from stroke onset and delineated carotid and vertebrobasilar circulations from aortic arch up to intracranial branches. Two reviewers blinded to group assignment recorded all vascular lesions, collateral status, and infarct pattern.RESULTS: ORV patients had less atherosclerotic risk factors at presentation. In referent patients, high-grade stenoses were mostly focal at the proximal internal carotid artery. In contrast, high-grade ORV lesions diffusely involved the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery and were more frequently bilateral (54% versus 22%), tandem (23% versus 10%), associated with complete occlusion in one or both carotid arteries (30% versus 9%), vertebral artery (VA) steno-occlusions (28% versus 16%), and external carotid artery stenosis (19% versus 5%) (all P<0.05). With comparable rates of vascular anomaly, ORV patients showed more established collateral circulations through leptomeningeal arteries, anterior communicating artery, posterior communicating artery, suboccipital/costocervical artery, and retrograde flow in ophthalmic artery. In terms of infarct topography, the frequencies of cortical or subcortical watershed infarcts were similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: ORV angiographic features and corresponding collaterals are distinct from atherosclerotic patterns at initial stroke presentation. Clinical decompensation, despite more extensive collateralization, may precipitate stroke in ORV.",Included,0.09001127
1122,"Epidemiological investigations of aircrew: an occupational group with low-level cosmic radiation exposure Aircrew and passengers are exposed to low-level cosmic ionising radiation. Annual effective doses for flight crew have been estimated to be in the order of 2-5 mSv and can attain 75 mSv at career end. Epidemiological studies in this occupational group have been conducted over the last 15-20 years, usually with a focus on radiation-associated cancer. These studies are summarised in this note. Overall cancer risk was not elevated in most studies and subpopulations analysed, while malignant melanoma, other skin cancers and breast cancer in female aircrew have shown elevated incidence, with lesser risk elevations in terms of mortality. In some studies, including the large German cohort, brain cancer risk appears elevated. Cardiovascular mortality risks were generally very low. Dose information for pilots was usually derived from calculation procedures based on routine licence information, types of aircraft and routes/hours flown, but not on direct measurements. However, dose estimates have shown high validity when compared with measured values. No clear-cut dose-response patterns pointing to a higher risk for those with higher cumulative doses were found. Studies on other health outcomes have shown mixed results. Overall, aircrew are a highly selected group with many specific characteristics and exposures that might also influence cancers or other health outcomes. Radiation-associated health effects have not been clearly established in the studies available so far.",Included,0.12366633
1131,"Radiation-induced DNA damage in tumors and normal tissues. II. Influence of dose, residual DNA damage and physiological factors in oxygenated cells Detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors is important for many experimental and clinical situations. Several laboratories, including ours, have suggested that assays which measure radiation-induced DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) might be used to detect or quantify hypoxic cells in tumors and normal tissues. Recently, we demonstrated the feasibility of using an alkaline elution assay that measures strand breaks and DPCs to detect and/or quantify hypoxic cells in tissues. For this approach to be valid, DPCs must not be formed to any great extent in irradiated oxygenated cells, and the formation and repair of strand breaks and DPCs in oxygenated cells must not be modified appreciably by physiological factors (e.g. temperature, pH and nutrient depletion) that are often found in solid tumors. To address these issues, two sets of experiments were performed. In one set of experiments, oxygenated 9L cells in tissue culture, subcutaneous 9L tumors and rat cerebella were irradiated with doses of 15 or 50 Gy and allowed to repair until the residual strand break damage was low enough to detect DPCs. In another set of experiments, oxygenated exponentially growing or plateau-phase 9L cells in tissue culture were irradiated with a dose of 15 Gy at 37 or 20 degrees C, while the cells were maintained at a pH of either 6.6 or 7.3. DNA-protein crosslinks were formed in oxygenated cells about 100 times less efficiently than in hypoxic cells. In addition, temperature, pH, nutrient depletion and growth phase did not appreciably alter the formation and repair of strand breaks or the formation of DPCs in oxygenated 9L cells. These results support the use of this DNA damage assay for the detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors.",Included,0.1610386
851,"[Radiation treatment of metastatic tumor in the brain] Sixty-seven patients with metastatic tumor in the brain were seen from 1975 to Oct. 1985. 11 of the 22 untreated patients were followed to their death, the median survival was 2.9 months. The other 45 patients were all treated by irradiation. 40(89%) patients had bronchogenic carcinoma, three had primaries in other parts of the body and two had unknown primaries. In 16 patients, whole brain was irradiated to a dose of 1000-4000 cGy. Their 6 month survival rate was 25% but all died within one year. In 24 patients, whole brain was first irradiated to 3000-4000 cGy. Then the dose was increased to 5000-6000 cGy by cone down technique. Their 6 month survival was 75%, 1 year survival 33%. The high-dose-cone down method is obviously more effective. In the other 5 patients who were retreated locally for recurrence or new foci in the other parts of the brain, their survival was 4 to 8 months taken from the start of the second course of radiotherapy. One of these five patients is still living as of this writing. Extensive brain necrosis was observed in three patients who received whole brain radiation in the second course. Yet untoward reactions were noted in the two patients who received local irradiation in the second course. This may imply that, for the second course, only local radiation is indicated.",Included,0.23828495
1154,"Surface-Based Falff: A Potential Novel Biomarker for Prediction of Radiation Encephalopathy in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Radiation encephalopathy (RE) is an important potential complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who undergo radiotherapy (RT) that can affect the quality of life. However, a functional imaging biomarker of pre-symptomatic RE has not yet been established. This study aimed to assess radiation-induced gray matter functional alterations and explore fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) as an imaging biomarker for predicting or diagnosing RE in patients with NPC. A total of 60 patients with NPC were examined, 21 in the pre-RT cohort and 39 in the post-RT cohort. Patients in the post-RT cohort were further divided into two subgroups according to the occurrence of RE in follow-up: post-RT <inf>non-RE</inf> (n = 21) and post-RT <inf>REproved</inf><inf>infollow-up</inf> (n = 18). Surface-based and volume-based fALFF were used to detect radiation-induced functional alterations. Functional derived features were then adopted to construct a predictive model for the diagnosis of RE. We observed that surface-based fALFF could sensitively detect radiation-induced functional alterations in the intratemporal brain regions (such as the hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus), as well as the extratemporal regions (such as the insula and prefrontal lobe); however, no significant intergroup differences were observed using volume-based fALFF. No significant correlation between fALFF and radiation dose to the ipsilateral temporal lobe was observed. Support vector machine (SVM) analysis revealed that surface-based fALFF in the bilateral superior temporal gyri and left insula exhibited impressive performance (accuracy = 80.49%) in identifying patients likely to develop RE. We conclude that surface-based fALFF may serve as a sensitive imaging biomarker in the prediction of RE. Â© Copyright Â© 2021 Zhang, Kang, Zeng, Li, Gao, Liu, Shi and Liao.",Included,0.3383644
