628,"Ultrastructural morphometry of parotid acinar cells following fractionated irradiation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long term effects on the ultrastructure of parotid glands after fractionated irradiation. The method implemented involved 5 x 6 Gy and 5 x 8 Gy, Monday to Friday 6 MV photons. By unilateral irradiation, the contralateral parotid gland served as a control. Although irradiation diminished the acinar cell density in light microscopic sections from 75 to 32% after 5 x 8 Gy of irradiation, ultrastructural morphometry could not detect any statistically significant differences in acinar cell size, nuclear size, nuclear density, granule area, mean granule size, or granule density. In general, greater differences were seen between rats receiving 30 or 40 Gy, on both the irradiated and the control size, than between the irradiated side and the control side. This was interpreted as due to differences in the nutritional state of the animals. This analysis concluded that individual acinar cells that survive irradiation seem not to be damaged in the long term when evaluated at the ultrastructural level. The study further stresses the importance of adequate sampling sizes and the use of adequate controls.",Excluded,0.98643506
348,"Evidence of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and identification of dying cells in X-ray-induced cell death in the developing brain. Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats received a single dose of 2 Gy X-rays and were killed 6 hr later. Dying cells were characterized by extreme chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Dying cells were distributed in the primary and secondary germinal zones and in other brain regions. Among these latter, dying cells occurred in the cortical layers of the olfactory bulb, layers II-III and VIb of the neocortex, piriform and entorhinal cortex, stratum oriens and pyramidale of the hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, amygdala, brainstem, internal granular layer of the cerebellum, and cerebral and cerebellar white matter. Dying cells were immature cells, neurons and glial cells (including radial glia). In-situ labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation identified individual cells bearing fragmented DNA. Since the number of cells stained with this method was larger than the number of dying cells, as revealed with current histological techniques, it is suggested that nuclear DNA fragmentation precedes chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation in X-ray-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, agarose gel electrophoresis of extracted DNA from irradiated brains showed a ""ladder"" pattern which is typical of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and endonuclease activation.",Excluded,0.9864304
598,"Effect of internal irradiation on the maturing Purkinje cells in the rat. A Golgi study. Continuous irradiation in utero is reported to produce mental retardation and gross abnormalities of the brain in the human. A few experimental studies conducted so far also report gross brain defects in animals exposed to continuous irradiation in utero. Despite the increasing use of nuclear energy for power and radioisotopes in medicine, there is hardly any literature available on the effect of continuous irradiation on the structural details of the developing brain. After intraperitoneal injections of different doses of 131I (8, 18 and 32 microCi) and 32P (10 microCi) in new-born rats on the 6th postnatal day, cerebella stained by Golgi techniques were cut sagittally and the sections were examined on the 10th, 15th and 21st postnatal days. In the animals injected with 18 and 32 microCi of 131I and 10 microCi of 32P a large number of Purkinje cells showed morphological alterations not seen in the control groups or in the groups injected with 8 microCi of 131I. The changes observed included persistence of the perisomatic processes beyond the 10th postnatal day, multiple primary dendrites, angulation of the primary dendrites, long segments of primary dendrites without branches and significantly reduced dendritic volume. The number of affected cells was less on the 21st postnatal day. The effective radiation dose estimated in these groups ranged from 15 to 26 rad. Since the rats irradiated with 6 rad had not shown such changes it is believed that there is a threshold dose of radiation beyond which only changes are perceptible at neuronal level.",Excluded,0.9864137
123,"Effect of exposure to low-dose gamma radiation during late organogenesis in the mouse fetus. The abdominal region of pregnant Swiss mice was exposed to 0.05 to 0.50 Gy of gamma radiation on day 11.5 postcoitus. The animals were sacrificed on day 18 of gestation and the fetuses were examined for mortality, growth retardation, changes in head size and brain weight, and incidence of microphthalmia. No marked increase in fetal mortality or growth retardation was observed below 0.25 Gy; the increase in these parameters was significant only at 0.50 Gy. A significant reduction in head size and brain weight and a significant increase in the incidence of microphthalmia were observed at doses above 0.15 Gy. Detectable levels of microcephaly and microphthalmia were evident even at 0.10 Gy. A linear dose response was seen for these effects in the dose range of 0.05 to 0.15 Gy. It is concluded that the late period of organogenesis in the mouse, especially between days 10 and 12 postcoitus, is a particularly sensitive phase in the development of the skull, brain and eye.",Excluded,0.98639315
438,"Short- and long-term effects of low-dose prenatal X-irradiation in mouse cerebral cortex, with special reference to neuronal migration. To elucidate the short- and long-term effects of ionizing radiation on cell migration in the developing cerebral cortex, we labeled proliferating cells on day 14 of gestation of mice with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) followed by a single exposure to 0.1-1 Gy of X-rays. The brains of embryos on day 17 and offspring at 2, 3 and 8 weeks after birth were processed for BrdU immunohistochemistry to trace the movements of BrdU-labeled cells. The location of BrdU-labeled neurons in the cerebral cortex was quantitatively analyzed between irradiated animals and non-irradiated controls. We have demonstrated that the initial migration of BrdU-labeled cells from the matrix cell zone towards the cortical plate during embryonic periods was decelerated when exposed to X-rays of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 Gy on embryonic day 14, and that aberrantly placed neurons in the cerebral neocortex were noted in younger animals that were irradiated prenatally, whereas such derangement was less pronounced in mature animals. These observations suggest that some modification process might have occurred during the postnatal period.",Excluded,0.9863918
709,"Maturation of the GFAP-immunopositive glial network is delayed in the olfactory bulbs of rats subjected to early, low-dose X-irradiation. Young rats were subjected to low-level, repeated doses of x-irradiation from a Co60 source and examined for the presence and arrangement of their GFAP-immunopositive system at the light and electron microscopic levels. In 2-week-old control rats, labelled cells were already distributed homogeneously throughout the bulb, while in the experimental animals, a (newborn- and early postnatal-type) radial arrangement of immunoreactive fibres continued to persist even until the end of the fourth postnatal week. This delay in the maturation of the GFAP-immunopositive glial system may contribute to the hindered development of the bulbar neurones, neuronal connections, and field potentials, as found in earlier studies.",Excluded,0.986384

257,"Neuroprotective effect of EGb761 and low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. The present study was undertaken to investigate the pretreatment effects of standardized Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) and low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation on the neurological dysfunction in the reserpine model of PD. Male Wistar rats were pretreated orally with EGb761 or fractionated low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation or their combination, then subjected to intraperitoneal injection of reserpine (5 mg/kg body weight) 24 h after the final dose of EGb761 or radiation. Reserpine injection resulted in the depletion of striatal dopamine (DA) level, increased catalepsy score, increased oxidative stress indicated via depletion of glutathione (GSH), increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and iron levels, decreased DA metabolites metabolizing enzymes; indicated by inhibition by glutathione-S-transferase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-quinone oxidoreductase (NQO) activities, mitochondrial dysfunction; indicated by declined complex I activity, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level and increased apoptosis; indicated by decreased mitochondrial B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein level and by transmission electron microscope. EGb761 and low-dose gamma-radiation ameliorated the reserpine-induced state of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis in brain. It can be concluded that EGb761, a widely used herbal medicine and low dose of gamma-irradiation have protective effects for combating Parkinsonism possibly via replenishment of GSH levels.

276,"Risk factors for cerebrovascular deaths in patients operated and irradiated for pituitary tumors. Vascular mortality, especially cerebrovascular disease (CVD), are the most pronounced cause of mortality in women with hypopituitarism. In a cohort of 342 patients operated and irradiated for pituitary tumors, 31 died from CVD (CVD patients) between 1952 and 1996. The study assessed whether the radiation regimens and duration of symptoms of hypopituitarism before operation differed between the 31 CVD patients and the 62 matched patients from the same cohort who had not died from CVD (control patients). Furthermore, the infarction/hemorrhage ratio, type of clinical stroke syndrome, and time to death after stroke were investigated in the CVD patients and in matched controls from the general population who had died from CVD (population controls). No significant differences in maximum or centrally absorbed dose, maximum or central biological equivalent dose, field size, or number of fraction were recorded between CVD and control patients. A significant difference in the duration of symptoms of hypopituitarism before operation was recorded, but only in women (P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in the infarction/hemorrhage ratio (P > 0.3) of lacunar or posterior circulation syndrome compared with middle cerebral artery syndrome with cortical features (P = 0.22) or the proportion of patients who died within the first month after stroke onset (60% vs. 59%, respectively) between CVD patients and population controls. In conclusion, no significant effect on CVD deaths could be detected for any radiation parameter. A long history of unsubstituted pituitary insufficiency may be a contributing factor to the very high CVD mortality among women. There were no indications of significant differences in type of stroke, clinical stroke syndromes, or stroke fatality between the CVD patients and the population controls.",Excluded,0.9862938
501,"Zebrafish as a ""biosensor""? Effects of ionizing radiation and amifostine on embryonic viability and development. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a popular vertebrate model system for cancer and treatment-related research. Benefits include ease of care, rapid development, optical clarity of embryos, which allows visualization of major organ systems, and opportunities for genetic manipulation. However, specific parameters of radiation sensitivity have not been systematically documented. We investigated the effects of radiation and a radiomodifier on zebrafish viability and embryonic development. Embryos were exposed to gamma-radiation (5, 10, or 20 Gy) at sequential times postfertilization and serially assessed for viability and morphologic abnormalities. As expected, lethality and morphologic perturbations were more pronounced earlier in embryogenesis and with higher radiation doses and were partially reversed by amifostine. The effects of radiation and concurrent treatment with amifostine on the developmental organization of the eye and brain were striking. Radiation resulted in hypocellularity and disorganization of the cellular layers of the retina, effects partially reversed by amifostine, as well as lens opacification. Radiation strikingly reduced the volume of brain, but the volume loss was substantially blocked by amifostine. Increased terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling signal was noted in both the irradiated eye and brain, but reduced by amifostine. Finally, irradiating embryos resulted in caspase activation detectable in 96-well microplates, which was proportional to the number of embryos and radiation dose; the degree of activation was markedly reduced by amifostine. These results together suggest the power and versatility of the zebrafish in assessing the effects of radiation and radiomodifiers on organ and tissue development.",Excluded,0.9862773

580,"Paternal irradiation perturbs the expression of circadian genes in offspring. The circadian system represents a complex network which influences the timing of many biological processes. Recent studies have established that circadian alterations play an important role in the susceptibility to many human diseases, including cancer. Here we report that paternal irradiation in mice significantly affects the expression of genes involved in rhythmic processes in their first-generation offspring. Using microarrays, the patterns of gene expression were established for brain, kidney, liver and spleen samples from the non-exposed offspring of irradiated CBA/Ca and BALB/c male mice. The most over-represented categories among the genes differentially expressed in the offspring of control and irradiated males were those involved in rhythmic process, circadian rhythm and DNA-dependent regulation of transcription. The results of our study therefore provide a plausible explanation for the transgenerational effects of paternal irradiation, including increased transgenerational carcinogenesis described in other studies.",Excluded,0.9862482
16,"Fate of the multiple innervation of cerebellar Purkinje cells by climbing fibers in immature control, x-irradiated and hypothyroid rats. The fate of the multiple innervation of Purkinje cells (PCs) by climbing fibers (CFs) was studied as a function of age in immature rats rendered agranular by X-irradiation, in immature hypothyroid rats, and compared to that in controls. This was done by examining in each group the intracellular activities of PCs mediated via CFs throughout maturation. From the third day in control rats, CF responses of PCs evoked by juxta fastigial region (JF) stimulation or occurring spontaneously already resembled the adult responses with, however, some important differences: (1) most of these responses were graded by steps with the intensity of the stimulation before day 13, due to the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs (see below); (2) immature CF responses exhibited a longer duration and their initial spike started near the peak of the EPSP instead of near the baseline later on. Finally, an anlage of CF response was already present in most PCs on day 2, and consisted of a single fast spike elicited near the peak of an underlying all-or-none EPSP. In the 3 groups of rats, CF EPSPs already closely resembled the adult ones as early as 3 days, although their total duration and especially their time to peak were longer. In control rats, these CF EPSPs reversed with depolarizing currents from day 3 and currents for reversal were much lower than in the adult. 'Dual' CF EPSPs of PCS37 were encountered in immature 7- to 10-day-old controls, and persisted in hypothyroid rats until the end of the third postnatal week. The mono- or the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was ascertained in th 3 groups according to the graded or the all-or-none character of CF EPSPs, and the number of CFs impinging on a given PC was estimated by the number of steps in the response. In control rats, most of PCs were already multiply innervated by CFs as early as 3 days. The multiple innervation culminated on day 5 with an average number of 3.4 CFs for PC, and rapidly regressed later on, so that the adult-type monoinnervation was the rule after day 13. In hypothyroid rats, the establishment of the redundancy and its regression was delayed by 2--3 days. In X-irradiated rats, the settlement and the involution of the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was exactly superimposed with that seen in controls until day 8. Later on, regression of the supernumerary contacts no longer occurred so that most PCs remained multiply innervated until adulthood. Finally, the first clear-cut IPSPs were detected in PCs on day 9 in control and X-irradiated rats and 2--3 days later in hypothyroid animals.",Excluded,0.9862468

165,"The frequency of adverse events by radiation therapy for atomic bomb survivors with cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): In Japan, there are many survivors who received ionizing radiation by atomic bomb in 1945. Currently, atomic bomb survivors (ABS) who suffered from cancer are treated as same as usual cancer patients. However, it remains unclear whether the adverse events (AE) of radiation therapy (RT) are increased or not in ABS. To clarify the safety of RT for ABS, we evaluated the frequency of AE by RT in ABS. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively investigated medical records of patients who received curative RT for cancer between 2005 and 2010. We selected the ABS who were officially certified by the Japanese government. AE were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) score Ver.3. One hundred and sixty-five ABS were recruited in this study. Median age was 74 years old (59 to 93) and 96 (58.2%) were men. Median age at the time receiving ionizing radiation by atomic bomb was 11 years old (0 to 32). One hundred and thirty-six ABS (82.4%) were pre-treatment performance status (PS) 0, 21 (12.7%) was PS 1, and 8 (4.8%) were PS 2 or over. Thirty-seven were diagnosed with head and neck, 32 with genitourinary, 29 with breast, 27 with gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary and pancreatic, 23 with lung and mediastinum, and 17 with other cancer. Result(s): One hundred four ABS were definitive irradiation, 48 were postoperative irradiation, and 13 were pre-operative irradiation. Concurrent chemotherapy was performed on 51. Median dose of external RTwas 50 Gy (30 to 78) based on their cancer type. Fifteen patients were performed on stereotactic RT, 12 on intensity-modulated RT, and 11 on brachytherapy. All patients were received standard dose irradiation and completed planned RT. No patients received extended RTover 1 week. Median observation time was 40 months (1 to 84). One hundred fifty-six patients (94.5%) were alive and 9 (5.5%) were dead when at the time investigated. There were no patients who died of AE in the entire course. In acute AE, sixteen patients (9.7%) were classified into grade 3 or above, i.e. one with esophageal mucositis and 15 with hematotoxicity (Grade 3: 11, Grade 4: 4). All these patients received concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Grade 4 or 5 non-hematotoxicitic AE was not identified. In late AE, twelve patients (7.3%) were classified into Grade 3 or above. Four patients were classified into Grade 4, i.e. 3 with myelodysplastic syndrome and 1 with cerebral infarction. Conclusion(s): Notable incensements of AE were not observed during and after RT for ABS. This study clarified that standard dose RT prescription can be administered safely to ABS with cancer even though they received ionizing radiation by atomic bomb before half century.",Excluded,0.9859428
627,"Effect of intra-peritoneal fludarabine on rat spinal cord tolerance to fractionated irradiation. The effect of fludarabine (9-beta-D-arabinosyl-2-fluoroadenine-5'- monophosphate), an adenine nucleoside analogue, on the tolerance of the spinal cord to fractionated irradiation was studied in a rat model. Anesthetized female Fisher 344 rats received irradiation to 2 cm of the cervical spine with a telecobalt unit (dose rate 1.14 Gy/min). Radiation was administered in two, four or eight fractions spread over a 48-h period with or without fludarabine. Animals assigned to combined therapy received two daily intraperitoneal injections of fludarabine (150 mg/kg) given 3 h prior to the first daily radiation fraction. It was found that fludarabine reduced the iso-effect dose required to induce leg paresis at 9 months after irradiation for all fractionation schedules. Dose modification factors of 1.23, 1.29 and greater than 1.27 were obtained for two, four and eight fractions, respectively. Fitting the data with the direct analysis method of Thames et al. with an incomplete repair model [18] showed that the potentiating effect of fludarabine may be mediated through reduction in the number of 'tissue-rescuing units' (InK). Alpha and beta values were slightly but not significantly decreased, whereas the alpha/beta ratio was unchanged. These features suggest that fludarabine did not significantly inhibit cellular repair processes but rather reduced the spinal cord tolerance by a fixed additive toxic effect on the same target cells. In rodent models, the combination of fludarabine and fractionated radiation has previously been found to yield a therapeutic gain, i.e., the drug enhanced tumor response to a greater extent than it reduced normal tissue tolerance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded,0.98591137
676,"Radiation Induced Metabolic Alterations Associate With Tumor Aggressiveness and Poor Outcome in Glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is uniformly fatal with a 1-year median survival, despite best available treatment, including radiotherapy (RT). Impacts of prior RT on tumor recurrence are poorly understood but may increase tumor aggressiveness. Metabolic changes have been investigated in radiation-induced brain injury; however, the tumor-promoting effect following prior radiation is lacking. Since RT is vital to GBM management, we quantified tumor-promoting effects of prior RT on patient-derived intracranial GBM xenografts and characterized metabolic alterations associated with the protumorigenic microenvironment. Human xenografts (GBM143) were implanted into nude mice 24 hrs following 20 Gy cranial radiation vs. sham animals. Tumors in pre-radiated mice were more proliferative and more infiltrative, yielding faster mortality (p < 0.0001). Histologic evaluation of tumor associated macrophage/microglia (TAMs) revealed cells with a more fully activated ameboid morphology in pre-radiated animals. Microdialyzates from radiated brain at the margin of tumor infiltration contralateral to the site of implantation were analyzed by unsupervised liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In pre-radiated animals, metabolites known to be associated with tumor progression (i.e., modified nucleotides and polyols) were identified. Whole-tissue metabolomic analysis of pre-radiated brain microenvironment for metabolic alterations in a separate cohort of nude mice using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR revealed a significant decrease in levels of antioxidants (glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (ASC)), NAD<sup>+</sup>, Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates, and rise in energy carriers (ATP, GTP). GSH and ASC showed highest Variable Importance on Projection prediction (VIPpred) (1.65) in Orthogonal Partial least square Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA); Ascorbate catabolism was identified by GC-MS. To assess longevity of radiation effects, we compared survival with implantation occurring 2 months vs. 24 hrs following radiation, finding worse survival in animals implanted at 2 months. These radiation-induced alterations are consistent with a chronic disease-like microenvironment characterized by reduced levels of antioxidants and NAD<sup>+</sup>, and elevated extracellular ATP and GTP serving as chemoattractants, promoting cell motility and vesicular secretion with decreased levels of GSH and ASC exacerbating oxidative stress. Taken together, these data suggest IR induces tumor-permissive changes in the microenvironment with metabolomic alterations that may facilitate tumor aggressiveness with important implications for recurrent glioblastoma. Harnessing these metabolomic insights may provide opportunities to attenuate RT-associated aggressiveness of recurrent GBM.",Excluded,0.9858823

Quantitative assessment of tracer uptake compared with 16 matched healthy volunteers was consistent with the presence of lesions. Measurement of uptake in brain regions of the hemisphere not containing the primary tumour still showed significant reductions in patients.

Glioblastomas (GBM) are brain tumors with a poor prognosis despite treatment that combines surgical resection and radio-chemotherapy. These tumors are characterized by abundant vascularization and significant cellular heterogeneity including GBM stem-like cells (GSC) which contribute to tumor aggressiveness, resistance, and recurrence. Recent data has demonstrated that GSC are directly involved in the formation of new vessels via their transdifferentiation into Tumor Derived Endothelial Cells (TDEC). We postulate that cellular stress such as ionizing radiation (IR) could enhance the transdifferentiation of GSC into TDEC. GSC neurospheres isolated from 3 different patients were irradiated or not and were then transdifferentiated into TDEC. In fact, TDEC obtained from irradiated GSC (TDEC IR+) migrate more towards VEGF, form more pseudotubes in Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> in vitro and develop more functional blood vessels in Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> plugs implanted in Nude mice than TDEC obtained from non-irradiated GSC. Transcriptomic analysis allows us to highlight an overexpression of Tie2 in TDEC IR+. All IR-induced effects on TDEC were abolished by using a Tie2 kinase inhibitor, which confirms the role of the Tie2 signaling pathway in this process. Finally, by analyzing Tie2 expression in patient GBMs by immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that the number of Tie2+ vessels increases in recurrent GBM compared with matched untreated tumors. In conclusion, we demonstrate that IR potentiates proangiogenic features of TDEC through the Tie2 signaling pathway, which indicates a new pathway of treatment-induced tumor adaptation. New therapeutic strategies that associate standard treatment and a Tie2 signaling pathway inhibitor should be considered for future trials.",Excluded,0.98499864

Animals receiving the prostaglandin systemically had values of 60 +/- 10 (6.5 Gy), 54 +/- 3 (8.5 Gy), 66 +/- 6 (10 Gy), and 30.1 +/- 8 (12.5 Gy). Topical application of the prostaglandin resulted in protection that yielded 52 +/- 3 (8.5 Gy), 34 +/- 4 (10 Gy), and 3.2 +/- 0.9 (12.5 Gy) hairs per field. Both systemic and topical application of 16,16 dm PGE<inf>2</inf> protected from some degree of radiation-induced alopecia, which supports the conclusion that prostaglandins may be useful in the protection of hair follicles in patients treated with radiation for brain tumors.",Excluded,0.98455864
734,"Skin fibroblast cell lines derived from non-Hodgkin's-lymphoma (NHL) patients show increased sensitivity to chronic gamma irradiation. Cultured fibroblast cells from 19 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 3 patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT), 3 AT heterozygotes and 11 (presumed) normal subjects were studied for impaired colony-forming ability after chronic gamma irradiation. Five cell lines from the NHL patients were also examined for the sensitivity to acute gamma irradiation, as compared with those of normal subjects. To ascertain the degree of radiosensitivity of different cell lines, a comparison was made of the D10 values (radiation dose resulting in 10% survival) for each cell line, estimated ""by eye"" from the actual survival curves, and also from the calculated curves fitted to a log-linear model. It was observed that the acute gamma irradiation failed to show any appreciable difference in the radiation response of the cell lines from NHL patients as compared with those of normal subjects. However, chronic irradiation demonstrated significantly increased radiosensitivity in at least 10-12 NHL patients with a p value of less than 0.05, when the D10 values of each patient's cell line were compared with the calculated composite values for the normals. When the D10 values of the NHL patients and the normal subjects were compared as 2 groups, the former appeared to be significantly more sensitive to chronic gamma irradiation (p less than 0.0001). The same level of significant difference in radiosensitivity was found between the 2 groups when their D37 values (radiation dose resulting in 37% survival) were compared. In general, the radiation response of the NHL patients was similar to that of the AT homozygotes and heterozygotes used as a positive control group. Our data thus show that increased radiosensitivity is associated with the NHL patients studied, indicating an underlying abnormality of their DNA repair.",Excluded,0.98443526
181,"Afferent-target cell interactions in the cerebellum: negative effect of granule cells on Purkinje cell development in lurcher mice. Lurcher (Lc) is a gain-of-function mutation in the delta2 glutamate receptor gene that results in a large, constitutive inward current in the cerebellar Purkinje cells of +/Lc mice. +/Lc Purkinje cells fail to differentiate fully and die during postnatal development. In normal mice, interactions with granule cells promote Purkinje cell dendritic differentiation. Partial destruction of the granule cell population in young +/Lc mice by x irradiation resulted in a significant increase in Purkinje cell dendritic growth and improved cytoplasmic structure but did not prevent Purkinje cell death. These results indicate two components to Purkinje cell abnormalities in +/Lc mice: a retardation/blockade of dendritic development that is mediated by interactions with granule cells and the death of the cell. Thus, the normal trophic effects of granule cell interaction on Purkinje cell development are absent in the +/Lc cerebellum, suggesting that granule cells are powerful regulators of Purkinje cell differentiation.",Excluded,0.9842903

The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (Atm) protein kinase is a central regulator of the cellular response to DNA damage. Although Atm can regulate p53, it is not known if this Atm function varies between tissues. Previous studies showed that the induction of p53 and apoptosis by whole-body ionizing radiation varies greatly between tissue and tumor types, so here we asked if Atm also had a tissue-specific role in the ionizing radiation response. Irradiated Atm-null mice showed impaired p53 induction and apoptosis in thymus, spleen, and brain. In contrast, radiation-induced p53, apoptosis, phosphorylation of Chk2, and G(2)-M cell cycle arrest were slightly delayed in Atm(-/-) epithelial cells of the small intestine but reached wild-type levels by 4 h. Radiation-induced p53 and apoptosis in Atm(-/-) hair follicle epithelial cells were not impaired at any of the time points examined. Thus, Atm is essential for radiation-induced apoptosis in lymphoid tissues but is largely dispensable in epithelial cells. This indicates that marked differences in DNA damage signaling pathways exist between tissues, which could explain some of the tissue-specific phenotypes, especially tumor suppression, associated with Atm deficiency.",Excluded,0.98335326

BACKGROUND: There is conflicting evidence regarding the association between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer (PC) and the risk of developing stroke and thromboembolic events. Our study evaluated the association between ADT use and development of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE) in a homogenous group of men with PC treated with definitive radiation therapy (RT) after controlling for multiple sources of confounding.METHODS: Observational cohort study of patients diagnosed with PC at the US Department of Veterans Affairs between 1 January 2001 and October 31, 2015 and treated with definitive RT. Exposure was initiation of ADT within 1 year of PC diagnosis. Primary outcomes were development of stroke, TIA, DVT, or PE.RESULTS: 44,246 men with median follow-up of 6.8 years. The overall cumulative incidences of stroke, TIA, DVT, and PE at 10 years were 6.0, 3.0, 3.4, and 1.9%, respectively. In the multivariable competing risks model, there was a significant association between ADT and stroke (subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.09-1.30, p < 0.01), TIA (SHR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.08-1.41, p < 0.01), and DVT (SHR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.04-1.34, p < 0.01). ADT was only associated with PE in men receiving ADT for > 1 year (SHR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.06-1.69, p-value = 0.03).CONCLUSION: We observed an increase in the risk of stroke, TIA, and DVT in men receiving ADT and an increased risk of PE in men receiving long-term ADT. These results highlight concerns regarding long-term risks of ADT on stroke and thromboembolic events in the treatment of PC.",Excluded,0.98317266

399,"Local irradiation not only induces homing of human mesenchymal stem cells at exposed sites but promotes their widespread engraftment to multiple organs: A study of their quantitative distribution after irradiation damage. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to migrate to various tissues. There is little information on the fate and potential therapeutic efficacy of the reinfusion of MSCs following total body irradiation (TBI). We addressed this question using human MSC (hMSCs) infused to nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice submitted to TBI. Further, we tested the impact of additional local irradiation (ALI) superimposed to TBI, as a model of accidental irradiation. NOD/SCID mice were transplanted with hMSCs. Group 1 was not irradiated before receiving hMSC infusion. Group 2 received only TBI at a dose of 3.5 Gy, group 3 received local irradiation to the abdomen at a dose of 4.5 Gy in addition to TBI, and group 4 received local irradiation to the leg at 26.5 Gy in addition to TBI. Fifteen days after irradiation, quantitative and spatial distribution of the hMSCs were studied. Histological analysis of mouse tissues confirmed the presence of radio-induced lesions in the irradiated fields. Following their infusion into nonirradiated animals, hMSCs homed at a very low level to various tissues (lung, bone marrow, and muscles) and no significant engraftment was found in other organs. TBI induced an increase of engraftment levels of hMSCs in the brain, heart, bone marrow, and muscles. Abdominal irradiation (AI) as compared with leg irradiation (LI) increased hMSC engraftment in the exposed area (the gut, liver, and spleen). Hind LI as compared with AI increased hMSC engraftment in the exposed area (skin, quadriceps, and muscles). An increase of hMSC engraftment in organs outside the fields of the ALI was also observed. Conversely, following LI, hMSC engraftment was increased in the brain as compared with AI. This study shows that engraftment of hMSCs in NOD/SCID mice with significantly increased in response to tissue injuries following TBI with or without ALI. ALI induced an increase of the level of engraftment at sites outside the local irradiation field, thus suggesting a distant (abscopal) effect of radiation damage.

It is now possible to examine in detail exchanges between sister chromatids (SCEs) and to attempt to investigate the relationships of such exchanges to aberration formation and DNA-repair mechanisms. The frequency of SCEs is dramatically increased by chemical mutagens and may reflect the level of DNA damage. Lymphocytes from patients with ataxia telangiectasis (AT) show high levels of spontaneous chromosome damage and are hypersentive to ionising radiations and it was of interest to examine the levels of SCE induced in these cells by various mutagens. The frequencies of SCE after treatment with X=rays or three chemical mutagens were equivalent to those in normal cells.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated after exposure to ionizing radiation and toxic peptides, in mitochondrial metabolism and during aging contribute to damage of cell's structural and functional components and can lead to diseases. Monomers and small oligomers of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, players in Alzheimer's disease, are recently suggested to be involved in damaging of neurons, instead of extracellular Abeta plaques. We demonstrate that externally applied disaggregated Abeta<sub>1-42</sub> peptide interacts preferentially with acidic compartments (lysosomes). We compared standard cell cultivation (21% O<sub>2</sub>) to more physiological cell cultivation (5% O<sub>2</sub>). Cells did not exhibit a dramatic increase in ROS and change in glutathione level upon 4 muM Abeta peptide treatment, whereas exposure to 2 Gy X-rays increased ROS and changed glutathione level and ATP concentration. The occurrence of the 4977 bp deletion in mtDNA and significant protein carbonylation were specific effects of IR and more pronounced at 21% O<sub>2</sub>. An increase in cell death after Abeta peptide treatment or irradiation was unexpectedly restored to the control level or below when both were combined, particularly at 5% O<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, Abeta peptide at low concentration can trigger neuroprotective mechanisms in cells exposed to radiation.

52,"Use of human mesenchymal stem cell treatment to prevent anhedonia in a rat model of traumatic brain injury. PURPOSE: Major depression and related mood disorders are the most common long-term outcomes associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Given the potentially debilitating consequences of depression, and the fact that TBI patients are frequently refractory to antidepressant drugs, new therapies are clearly needed. We hypothesized that human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), delivered intravenously, can effectively treat TBI-induced depression and other behavioral deficits associated with TBI.METHODS: Rats (n = 8 per group) were subjected to experimental TBI or control sham operation. Six hours post TBI, rats were treated with 1x106 hMSC or vehicle control. Immediately after TBI and prior to hMSC or control treatment, rats were subjected to either targeted precision x-ray irradiation to eliminate subventricular zone (SVZ) proliferation or sham irradiation. One week after TBI, SVZ irradiation, and hMSC treatment, rats were evaluated for the depression-like behavior, anhedonia, using the two-bottle saccharin preference paradigm; and for working memory using the novel object recognition test.RESULTS: TBI resulted in a 54% (p<=0.05) decrease in saccharin preference scores while treatment of TBI with hMSC fully prevented this anhedonic behavior. TBI was also found to produce a 73% (p<=0.05) decrease in novel object interaction time, indicating impaired working memory, and was similarly improved by treatment with hMSC. The ability of hMSC to prevent TBI-associated depression and working memory impairment was eliminated when SVZ proliferation was inhibited by irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: This work has identified a possible role for hMSC in the treatment of TBI-induced depression and other behaviors and suggests a mechanistic role for proliferative cells of the SVZ proliferation in hMSC efficacy.",Excluded,0.98045474
81,"X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region of two-component heterokaryons of Neurospora crassa. VIII. Dose-dependence of the overall spectrum. There is considerable controversy in the literature concerning the nature of X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in various experimental organisms. To investigate this problem in Neurospora crassa a series of experiments (Webber and de Serres, 1965) was performed to study the induction-kinetics of X-ray-induced mutation in the adenine-3 (ad-3) region of a two-component heterokaryon (H-12). Subsequent genetic analyses (de Serres, 1989a,b,c, 1990a), on a series of 832 mutants recovered in these experiments, have shown that 3 different classes of ad-3 mutants were recovered, namely gene/point mutations, multilocus deletions and multiple-site mutations. Complementation studies with a series of genetic markers that define 21 genetic loci in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent genetic regions have shown that ad-3 mutants classified as multilocus deletions result from the inactivation of a series of loci in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent regions of Linkage Group I, whereas multiple-locus mutations result from combinations of gene/point mutations and multilocus deletions. Analysis of the induction kinetics of these 3 different classes, after completion of the genetic characterization of all mutants (de Serres, 1990b) demonstrated that gene/point mutations increase linearly with X-ray dose, whereas multilocus deletions and multiple-site mutations increase as the square of X-ray dose. Further analysis of allelic complementation among the gene/point mutations at the ad-3B locus (de Serres, 1990c), demonstrated that the spectrum of complementation patterns was dose-dependent: complementing mutants with nonpolarized patterns decreased and noncomplementing mutations increased with increasing X-ray dose. There was little or no change with dose in the frequency of mutants with polarized patterns. In the present report, data from studies published previously have been utilized, along with additional data from the original X-ray experiments (12-5, 12-6, 12-7, and 12-10; see Webber and de Serres, 1965) to develop composite complementation maps of the X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent regions as a function of X-ray dose. This analysis of the overall spectrum of X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region demonstrated marked dose-dependence and provides an explanation for the discrepancies in the literature with regard to specific-locus studies in different experimental organisms.",Excluded,0.97587115

PURPOSE: A prospective study was performed to formally relate dose-dependent radiologically defined changes in normal brain induced by radiotherapy (RT) to neurocognitive dysfunction in subjects with primary brain tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Adult patients receiving three-dimensional RT for central nervous system (CNS) tumors were enrolled. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning and neuropsychological testing were performed before RT and 3 weeks and 6 months after treatment. Analyses were performed for correlations between changes in 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG)-PET (metabolism), (15)O-PET (relative blood flow), regional radiation dose, follow-up time, and neuropsychological test scores.RESULTS: Eleven subjects were enrolled and 6 completed follow-up studies. The PET data showed reduced FDG uptake, with average decreases of 2-6% in regions of the brain receiving greater than 40 Gy at 3 weeks' and 6 months' follow-up. The (15)O-H(2)O PET showed increases (<10%) at 3 weeks in relative regional blood flow in brain receiving greater than 30 Gy, but less at the 6-month follow-up studies. There were significant correlations between decreases in FDG uptake and increased scores from the Symptom Checklist-90-R, with an average increase in T score of 2 (p < 0.0001). The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test showed a significant correlation of decreased FDG uptake with increased errors and perseveration in test performance, with an average decrease in T score of 11 (p = 0.037).CONCLUSIONS: A dose-dependent response of CNS tissue was detected using FDG PET in this small number of patients. Decreases in CNS metabolism correlated with decreased performance on neuropsychological tests for problem solving, cognitive flexibility, and global measures of psychopathology. Additional research is needed to verify and define these findings.",Excluded,0.9757034

Radiation-induced local white matter (WM) damage has been observed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) within a priori-defined regions of interest following radiotherapy (RT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this study, we aimed to detect WM changes throughout the brain of NPC patients by DTI. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used to analyze DTI data from 81 NPC patients. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were quantified across the whole brain in separate groups: pre-RT, and <6, 6-12, and >12 months post-RT. We found that fractional anisotropy values were significantly lower in the right frontal, parietal, and occipital WM <6 months post-RT compared with pre-RT and remained significantly lower in the right frontal and parietal WM at >12 months. MD values were significantly higher in the right occipital, bilateral temporal, right occipital-temporal junction, left parietal, left centrum semiovale, and left frontal-parietal junction WM <6 months post-RT and remained higher in the right occipital WM at >12 months. This study suggests that changes in white matter microstructure following RT for NPC were widespread, complex, and dynamic.

However, risk factors that render certain individuals more vulnerable to depression following an inflammatory stimulus have not been determined. Drawing from animal stud-ies showing that reductions in neural plasticity may mediate effects of inflammation on depressive symptoms, we hypothesized that individuals genetically predisposed to lower levels of neural plasticity may be more susceptible to inflammation-induced depression. More specifically, the current study examined whether the Met allele of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, which predisposes individuals to reduced levels of plasticity, moderates the association between inflammation and depressive symptoms. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of 111 women with early-stage breast cancer who had recently completed treatment with surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy, which can activate inflammatory pathways. Participants provided blood draws for genotyping and assessment of circulating inflammatory markers, and completed a questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms, including somatic, affective, and cognitive components of depression. Results revealed a significant interaction between BDNF genotype and CRP in predicting depressive symptoms (p =.036), such that women carrying at least one Met allele displayed a stronger association between CRP and cognitive depressive symptoms than those without a Met allele. A similar interaction emerged for IL-1ra (p =.055).

The major goal of this study was to determine if treatment with the newly constructed plasmid vector for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (pGL1-TNF-alpha) could enhance the radiation-induced growth reduction of C6 rat glioma. In addition, two different forms of ionizing radiation (gamma-rays and protons) were utilized. Body and spleen mass, leukocyte blastogenesis, and flow cytometry analysis of cell populations in blood and spleen were performed to detect toxicity, if any, and to identify mechanisms that may correlate with the anti-tumor action of combination therapy. C6 tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously into athymic mice and allowed to become established before treatment initiation. pGL1-TNF-alpha was injected into the implanted tumors, which were then irradiated 16-18 hr later; each modality was administered three times over 8-9 days. The addition of pGL1-TNF-alpha significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of radiation (p < 0.05). The effect was more than additive, since pGL1-TNF-alpha alone did not slow tumor progression and radiation alone had only a modest effect. Administration of pGL1-TNF-alpha together with proton radiation resulted in tumor volumes that were 23% smaller than those following pGL1-TNF-alpha + gamma-ray treatment; a similar differential in tumor size was observed in the groups receiving only radiation. Body weights and blood and spleen cell analyses did not reveal treatment-related toxicity. High basal proliferation of blood leukocytes and increased B cell levels in the spleen were associated with pGL1-TNF-alpha + 60Co (gamma-radiation) or proton treatment.

BACKGROUND: To lower the risk of complications, carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has been proposed as an alternative to open surgery for carotid artery stenosis after neck irradiation. However, there are little postoperative data to support the benefits of this strategy. This study evaluated the outcome of CAS in patients who had undergone neck irradiation.METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at 15 vascular surgery or interventional radiology centers in France between January 1998 and July 2006. A total of 135 patients (115 men) with a mean age of 67 +/- 8 years (range, 43-88) underwent CAS for 149 irradiation-induced lesions. The interval between irradiation and discovery of the lesions was 12 +/- 8 years. Mean diameter reduction was 81% (range, 50%-95%), and stenosis was symptomatic in 34%. Contralateral carotid lesions were observed in 48% of patients, including thrombosis in 18 and stenosis >50% in 53.RESULTS: Technical failure occurred during CAS in three cases. The overall technical success rate was 98%. A cerebral protection device was used in 59%. No death, one transient ischemic attack, and two strokes occurred during the first postoperative month. Mean follow-up was 30 months. Six patients were lost to follow-up. Survival rates were 93.9% at 1 year and 75.3% at 3 years. Complications after the first postoperative month included neurologic events in six, carotid thrombosis in nine, and restenosis in 18. The rates of freedom from neurologic and anatomic events were, respectively, 96.2% and 93.2% at 1 year and 93.1% and 85.9% at 3 years.CONCLUSION: The immediate outcome of CAS for irradiation-induced carotid artery stenosis was satisfactory. Medium-term neurologic outcome was acceptable, but the incidence of anatomic events such as thrombosis and restenosis was high.

273,"Carbamylated erythropoietin reduces radiosurgically-induced brain injury. Gamma knife radiosurgery is an attractive noninvasive treatment of brain tumors and vascular malformations that minimizes collateral tissue damage. However, exposure of normal tissue to even low-dose radiation triggers a cascade of acute and chronic injury and potentially significant morbidity and mortality. Because many irradiated patients now survive for years, identifying methods to prevent radiotherapy-induced collateral tissue damage is a major focus of current research. Erythropoietin (EPO), a cytokine produced locally by many tissues in response to injury, antagonizes apoptosis, reduces inflammation, and promotes healing. Systemic administration of recombinant EPO, widely used for treatment of anemia, provides robust protection from numerous insults in a variety of tissues, including the brain. Although irradiation injury is likely sensitive to EPO, the hematopoietic activity of EPO is undesirable in this setting, increasing erythrocyte number and predisposing to thrombosis. To avoid these potential adverse effects, we developed carbamylated EPO (CEPO) which does not stimulate the bone marrow. In this study, we show that CEPO (50 microg kg(-1) intraperitoneally) improves functional outcome when administered to adult rats just before, and then once daily for 10 d after, a necrotizing dose of radiation (100 Gy) to the right striatum. Immediately following irradiation, use and reflex movements of the contralateral forelimb to vibrissae stimulation were abnormal but rapidly improved in animals receiving CEPO. Moreover, histological examination revealed that the extent of brain necrosis after 90 days was reduced by approximately 50%. These findings further extend the kinds of injury for which administration of a tissue-protective cytokine provides benefit.",Excluded,0.661243

For the radiometric assays the following organs or tissues were taken: stomach, small and large intestine, liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, muscles, spleen, blood, brain, testicles. The results are given in the percent of Fe dose in 1 g of wet tissue. The statistical analysis (Students' t test) was performed. The results indicate that in poisoned animals the Fe distribution was different than in controls. Increased concentration of 59Fe was noted after 3 and 6 hours in stomach and after 1 day in large intestine, whereas in other organs the Fe concentration was lower, correlating usually with the Hg dose. One interesting thing was noted: the Fe concentration in almost all organs was higher in rats intoxicated with the 12 mg/kg dose of HgCl2 and given afterwards BAL (IV group), than in rats that were not given BAL. Present results can have some practical significance in therapeutic procedure in mercury poisoning and during the convalescence.",Excluded,0.6399211
707,"Place of radiotherapy in the treatment of meningiomes. [French]. Between 1962 and 1986, 32 patients with intracranial meningiomas were referred to the Institut Gustave-Roussy for external radiotherapy either after incomplete surgery, or unfavorable histology (meningiosarcoma/anaplastic meningioma), or after recurrences. In the latter case, the mean time interval between the first surgery and the recurrence was 2 years (range: 1-6 years). Radiotherapy was performed using photons, electrons or mixed phetons-electrons. The mean total dose was 48 Gy (range: 9-65 Gy) delivered in a mean time of 35 days with a 19 mean number of fractions. Radiotherapy was interrupted in three cases at 9 Gy-17 Gy-20 Gy because of neurological worsening. The actuarial 5-year survival was 64%. Among the 32 patients, 11 died, eight of tumoral progression or recurrence and three of other causes (one ovarian carcinoma, two unknown). Among the 21 alive patients, eight presented a recurrence; five of them could be reoperated on with two complete resections. None of the following factors were found to be of prognostic value on the survival nor on the recurrence occurrence: age, tumor location, first surgical resection type, and, in the group of patients treated at the time of recurrence, the quality of the surgery at the time of recurrence and the time interval between the first surgery and the recurrence. Only one factor was evidenced as of significant value on the recurrence as well as the 10-year survival: the total dose of irradiation with a 10-year survival rate of 74% for total doses higher than or equal to 47 Gy versus 14% when the total dose was lower than 47 Gy.",Excluded,0.6322319
171,"Low Dose Radiation Therapy, Particularly with 0.5 Gy, Improves Pain in Degenerative Joint Disease of the Fingers: Results of a Retrospective Analysis. Low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) has been successfully established for decades as an alternative analgesic treatment option for patients suffering from chronic degenerative and inflammatory diseases. In this study, 483 patients were undergoing LDRT for degenerative joint disease of the fingers and thumb at the University Hospital Erlangen between 2004 and 2019. Radiotherapy was applied according to the German guidelines for LDRT. Several impact factors on therapeutic success, such as the age and gender, the number of affected fingers, the single and cumulative dose, as well as the number of series, were investigated. In summary, 70% of the patients showed an improvement of their pain following LDRT. No significant impact was found for the factors age, gender, the number of series or the cumulative dosage. Patients with an involvement of the thumb showed a significantly worse outcome compared to patients with an isolated affection of the fingers. In this cohort, patients receiving a single dose of 0.5 Gy reported a significantly better outcome than patients receiving 1.0 Gy, strongly suggesting a reduction in the total dose. In summary, LDRT is a good alternative treatment option for patients suffering from degenerative and inflammatory joint disease of the fingers.",Excluded,0.5911827
480,"Leptin restores adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a chronic unpredictable stress model of depression and reverses glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling. Stress and glucocorticoid stress hormones inhibit neurogenesis, whereas antidepressants increase neurogenesis and block stress-induced decrease in neurogenesis. Our previous studies have shown that leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone with antidepressant-like properties, promotes baseline neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. This study aimed to determine whether leptin is able to restore suppression of neurogenesis in a rat chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model of depression. Chronic treatment with leptin reversed the CUS-induced reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis and depression-like behaviors. Leptin treatment elicited a delayed long-lasting antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim behavioral despair test, and this effect was blocked by ablation of neurogenesis with X-irradiation. The functional isoform of the leptin receptor, LepRb, and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) were colocalized in hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cells in vivo and in vitro. Leptin treatment reversed the GR agonist dexamethasone (DEX)-induced reduction of proliferation of cultured neural stem/progenitor cells from adult hippocampus. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that leptin and DEX converged on glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and beta-catenin. While DEX decreased Ser9 phosphorylation and increased Tyr216 phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, leptin increased Ser9 phosphorylation and attenuated the effects of DEX at both Ser9 and Tyr216 phosphorylation sites of GSK-3beta. Moreover, leptin increased total level and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, a primary substrate of GSK-3beta and a key regulator in controlling hippocampal neural progenitor cell proliferation, and reversed the inhibitory effects of DEX on beta-catenin. Taken together, our results suggest that adult neurogenesis is involved in the delayed long-lasting antidepressant-like behavioral effects of leptin, and leptin treatment counteracts chronic stress and glucocorticoid-induced suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis via activating the GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway.",Excluded,0.5537514
595,"Weiss Lecture. Effects of radiations of different qualities on cells: molecular mechanisms of damage and repair. Studies of ionizing radiations of different quality are discussed with particular emphasis on damage to DNA of mammalian cells. Three related themes are followed. Firstly, inactivation and mutation experiments with ultrasoft X-rays and slow heavy ions, coupled with theoretical analyses of the structures of the radiation tracks, have emphasized the biological importance of localized track features over nanometre dimensions. This led to the suggestion that the critical physical features of the tracks are the stochastic clusterings of ionizations, directly in or very near to DNA, resulting in clustered initial molecular damage including various combinations of breaks, base damages, cross-links, etc. in the DNA. The quantitative hypotheses imply that final cellular effects from high-LET radiations are dominated by their more severe, and therefore less repairable, clustered damage, and that these are qualitatively different from the dominant low-LET damage. Second, relative effectiveness of different types of radiation led to questions on the mechanisms of induction of chromosome exchanges. The high efficiency of ultrasoft X-rays, despite their very short track lengths, suggested that single sites of DNA damage may lead to exchanges by a molecular process involving interaction with undamaged DNA. Also it is shown that a single site-specific DNA break, introduced by restriction enzymes, sometimes leads to a large deletion when misrepaired by cell extracts. These deletions occur between short DNA repeats, and are therefore a form of 'illegitimate' recombination, but clearly do not involve the interaction of two damage sites. Third, it was shown that cells from patients with the radiosensitive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) lack a post-irradiation recovery process. The sensitivity of AT cells to high LET radiations was found to be reduced relative to that for normal cells, reinforcing the concept that high LET damage is less easy to repair. AT patients are prone to lymphoreticular cancers, and their cells show characteristic chromosomal rearrangements, which may be associated with misrepair at specific genomic sequences. Similarly, studies of radiation-induced leukaemia in the mouse have implicated rearrangement at specific interstitial chromosome sites, which are rich in telomere-like repeat sequences.
