210,"In vivo and in vitro demonstration of reduced myelin synthesis following early postnatal exposure to ionizing radiation in the rat. Irradiation of the immature central nervous system has been demonstrated histopathologically to result in a reduction in the quantity of myelin seen at later developmental ages [S. A. Gilmore, J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 22, 294-301 (1963). J. A. Beal and J. L. Hall, J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 33, 128-143 (1974)]. The results from our investigation indicate that this reduction in myelin content can be attributed to a decrease in sulfatide synthesis. Rats received whole-brain irradiation with 0, 500, 1500, 2000, or 2500 rad at 4 days postnatal (dpn). All of the rats exposed to 2000 or 2500 rad and 70% of those exposed to 1500 rad died within 6 to 10 days. At 17 dpn, animals received single intraperitoneal injections of [35S]sodium sulfate. Myelin synthesis, as indexed by the incorporation of sulfate into total lipids and glycolipids, was reduced in a dose-related fashion. To demonstrate a direct effect of ionizing radiation on myelinogenesis, brain cell reaggregate cultures derived from fetal rats were exposed at 12 days in vitro (div) to 0, 250, 500, 1000, or 1500 rad. A dose-related reduction in [35S]sulfate incorporation through 21 div was demonstrated. Reaggregates exposed to 250 or 500 rad but not 1000 or 1500 rad resumed normal myelin synthesis by 28 div. These changes occurred in the absence of histopathological changes, changes in protein content, and changes in the rate of protein synthesis.",Excluded,0.9936253
40,"Behavioral effects in mice of postnatal exposure to low-doses of 137-cesium and bisphenol A. Bisphenol A (BPA) is the most important plasticizer used in many household products such as polycarbonate plastics or epoxy resins. Public and scientific concerns exist regarding the possibility that the neonatal exposure to BPA may contribute to neurobehavioral disorders. On the other hand, there is little information on the effects of low doses of ionizing radiation during critical phases of postnatal brain development, as well as the combination of radiation and environmental chemicals. In this study, C57BL/6J mice were exposed to low doses of internal radiation ((137)Cs), and/or BPA on postnatal day 10 (PND10). At the age of two months, animals were submitted to several tests to assess anxiety, activity, learning, and memory. Results showed that exposure to (137)Cs, alone or in combination with BPA, increased the anxiety-like of the animals without changing the activity levels. Animals exposed to (137)Cs showed impaired learning, and spatial memory, an impairment that was not observed in the groups co-exposed to BPA.",Excluded,0.9936225
175,"Experimental approaches to radiation-induced developmental abnormalities of the brain. The developing mammalian brain is highly susceptible to ionizing radiation. Significant increases in microcephalus, heterotopic cortical gray matter, and mental retardation have been noted in prenatally exposed survivors of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with the highest risk in those exposed during 8-15 weeks after fertilization. This stage corresponds to day 15 of pregnancy for rats and day 13 for mice in terms of brain development. The initial damage produced by radiation at this stage is cell death in the ventricular zone of the brain mantle, the radiosensitive germinal cell population. Disturbances in the production of neuronal germinal cells, and their migration to the cerebral cortex, give rise to malformations of the brain, such as microcephalus, an absent corpus callosum, disorganized cortical architecture, and heterotopic gray matter. Histological abnormalities are produced by about 500 mGy or more, and reduced brain weight is produced by 250 mGy or more. Mitotic delay, on the other hand, in the ventricular cells is caused by 100 mGy or more. A similar threshold level is suggested in human cases in the induction of mental retardation. The lowest doses of X- and gamma-radiation that induce detectable biological effects in rats and mice are around 30 mGy in increasing acute cell death.",Excluded,0.99362046

27,"Prenatal pathogenesis of hydro-micrencephaly induced by X-rays. An animal model. Experimental results are presented which describe induction and pathogenesis of the hydro-micrencephaly in NMRI-mice after single X-irradiation with 0.9 Gy or 1.9 Gy on gestation day (gd) 12. The ultrastructural alterations in the ventricular walls are sequentially investigated up to gross developmental damage. The ventricular zone is the most sensitive region in the developing brain. Its constituting undifferentiated and proliferating cells lose their palisade like orientation and fail subsequently to differentiate into primitive neurons, glia cells, or ependymal cells. Structurally this results in the thinning of ventricular walls by more than 50% associated with periventricular oedema and a dilation of the brain ventricles by 20-60%. Damage is clearly more pronounced with the higher dose. Repair processes originate from regions with intact Zonulae adherents which give also rise to typical globular or cylindrical heterotopic structures; these are known as rosettes and made up from undifferentiated proliferating ventricular cells. Perinatally in these rosettes cell replication persists, at a time when cell production in the ventricular zone has ceased. Histological changes are most prominent in and around the telencephalic roof consisting in replacement of the ependymal lining by a felt of glial fibers, faulty myelinisation, and periventricular oedema; postnatally these structural alterations lead to hydro-micrencephaly. Results from this animal model can be translated to the human situation because the fundamental developmental processes in the brain of mammals are similar despite species related differences of the time scale.",Excluded,0.99360764
537,"Nuclear and chromatin lipids: metabolism in normal and gamma-irradiated rats. The data on nuclear and chromatin lipid metabolism are reviewed. The amount of neutral lipids and phospholipids in nuclei of rat thymus, liver and neocortex neuron as well as the amount of lipids in rat thymus and liver chromatin are described. The metabolic responses of nuclear and chromatin lipids from thymus to different doses and dose rates of gamma-irradiation of rats are discussed. In most cases, the nuclear and chromatin lipid responses are distinct. Changes in nuclear and chromatin lipid metabolism in response to gamma-irradiation are suggested to connect with the signal transduction pathway and the regulation of the transcriptional and replicative chromatin activity. The influence of beta-carotene and picrotoxin on rat liver nuclear lipids and neocortex neuronal nuclear lipids, respectively, was analyzed. The possible involvement of the lipid traffic in the chromatin lipid responses to gamma-irradiation and other agents is suggested. [References: 66]",Excluded,0.9936062
368,"Angiographic, hemodynamic, and histological changes in an animal model of brain arteriovenous malformations treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Object Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a major cause of stroke. Many AVMs are effectively obliterated by stereotactic radiosurgery, but such treatment for lesions larger than 3 cm is not as effective. Understanding the responses to radiosurgery may lead to new biological enhancements to this treatment modality. The aim of the present study was to investigate the hemodynamic, morphological, and histological effects of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in an animal model of brain AVM. Methods An arteriovenous fistula was created by anastomosing the left external jugular vein to the side of the common carotid artery in 64 male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight 345 +/- 8.8 g). Six weeks after AVM creation, 32 rats were treated with a single dose of GKS (20 Gy); 32 animals received sham radiation. Eight irradiated and 8 control animals were studied at each specified time point (1, 3, 6, and 12 weeks) for hemodynamic, morphological, and histological characterization. Results Two AVMs showed partial angiographic obliteration at 6 weeks. Angiography revealed complete obliteration in 3 irradiated rats at 12 weeks. Blood flow in the ipsilateral proximal carotid artery (p < 0.001) and arterialized jugular vein (p < 0.05) was significantly lower in the irradiated group than in the control group. The arterialized vein's external diameter was significantly smaller in GKS-treated animals at 6 (p < 0.05) and 12 (p < 0.001) weeks. Histological changes included subendothelial cellular proliferation and luminal narrowing in GKS-treated animals. Neither luminal obliteration nor thrombus formation was identified at any of the time points in either irradiated or nonirradiated animals. Conclusions GKS produced morphological, angiographic, and histological changes in the model of AVM as early as 6 weeks after treatment. These results support the use of this model for studying methods to enhance radiation response in AVMs. Copyright Â© AANS, 2015.",Excluded,0.99360126

473,"Effect of in utero radiation dose fractionation on rat postnatal development, behavior and brain structure: 3-Hour interval. We have previously shown that exposure of the rat fetus to ionizing radiation produces dose-dependent (0.25-1.25 Gy) changes in postnatal growth and behavior, and decreases in cerebral cortex thickness. Pregnant rats were exposed to single doses of 0.5 or 1.0 Gy, or to two doses of 0.5 Gy (separated by a 3 h interval) on gestational day 15. Pups were weighed and subjected to behavioral tests (righting reflex; reflex suspension; negative geotaxis; continuous corridor; and length, width, and sine of gait) over postnatal days 7-28. The rats were then sacrificed and brains removed for histology. The fractionated doses produced responses that were generally intermediate between those produced by the single doses and which, by interpolation, could be expressed as equivalent to a single dose between 0.5 and 1.0 Gy. Overall, exposure of the fetal rat to two doses of 0.5 Gy separated by 3 h produced effects equivalent to a single dose of 0.85 Gy. We conclude that fractionation of radiation dose results in less damage to the developing rat cerebral cortex, as measured by postnatal growth, behavioral tests, and morphological assessment.",Excluded,0.9935853

556,"[Molecular and cellular mechanisms of late radiation injuries]. Late radiation damages arise more often in nonproliferating or slow proliferating tissues after local irradiation in large (intolerable) doses of ionizing radiation. Obviously the late radiation effects are induced by radiation damages to capillaries and disturbances of microcirculation in tissues. This is a basis for tissue hypoxia, ""oxidative stress"" and loss of parenchyma cells. The direct radiation effect on parenchyma cells has as a rule little importance for production of late radiation damages. Other type of late radiation damages can be discovered after sublethal irradiation of whole body. This is a cause of decrease of life span. In this case the important factors are also damages of vessels, disturbances in microcirculation and loss of parenchyma cells in ""target"" organs especially in neuroendocrine and immune systems. The new data on the possibility to decrease the late radiation damages after local or whole body irradiation using postradiation treatment with pulsed electric field (PEF) are considered. Mechanisms of PEF effects are explained in terms of its ability to induce nitric oxide production which causes intensification of blood microcirculation, as well as increase in SOD production and activity of repair enzymes.

The studies made showed that those persons under exposure to ionizing radiation exhibited more pronounced disturbances in the brain stem structures of the acoustic analyzer than those exposed to noise even if they were early in the course of the ear disorder.

95,"Biophysical Modeling of In Vivo Glioma Response After Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy in a Murine Model of Brain Cancer. PURPOSE: To develop and investigate a set of biophysical models based on a mechanically coupled reaction-diffusion model of the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor growth after radiation therapy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Post-radiation therapy response is modeled using a cell death model (M<sub>d</sub>), a reduced proliferation rate model (M<sub>p</sub>), and cell death and reduced proliferation model (M<sub>dp</sub>). To evaluate each model, rats (n = 12) with C6 gliomas were imaged with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast-enhanced MRI at 7 time points over 2 weeks. Rats received either 20 or 40 Gy between the third and fourth imaging time point. Diffusion-weighted MRI was used to estimate tumor cell number within enhancing regions in contrast-enhanced MRI data. Each model was fit to the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor cell number from time point 1 to time point 5 to estimate model parameters. The estimated model parameters were then used to predict tumor growth at the final 2 imaging time points. The model prediction was evaluated by calculating the error in tumor volume estimates, average surface distance, and voxel-based cell number.RESULTS: For both the rats treated with either 20 or 40 Gy, significantly lower error in tumor volume, average surface distance, and voxel-based cell number was observed for the M<sub>dp</sub> and M<sub>p</sub> models compared with the M<sub>d</sub> model. The M<sub>dp</sub> model fit, however, had significantly lower sum squared error compared with the M<sub>p</sub> and M<sub>d</sub> models.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that for both doses, the M<sub>p</sub> and M<sub>dp</sub> models result in accurate predictions of tumor growth, whereas the M<sub>d</sub> model poorly describes response to radiation therapy.",Excluded,0.9934928

In order to study the effect of proton beam irradiation on prolactinoma cells and hypophyseal intact cells tests with i.v. administration of TRH (200 micrograms) and LH-RH (100 micrograms) were performed in 16 women with prolactin-secreting adenomas before and in 2 mos.-2 years after irradiation of the pituitary body with a high energy narrow proton beam (1000 MeV) at a dose of 40-120 Gy. A curative therapeutic effect of proton therapy which was low with respect to reproductive function recovery, was combined with lowered functional reserves of hypophyseal thyrotrophs and gonadotrophs. The informative value of the tests with the releasing hormones was shown for the determination of damage of hypophyseal intact cells.

609,"Higher seizure susceptibility in rats with cortical dysplasia: A feedback systems perspective. Rationale: Cortical dysplasia (CD) is one of the leading causes of drug resistant focal epilepsy. Despite significant advances in various diagnostic and therapeutic methods, the basic mechanisms of higher susceptibility for seizures in patients with CD remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to develop a mathematical framework using principles from second order system dynamics to further characterize the effect of a ""second hit"" [acute single pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure] in animal model of in utero radiation-induced CD as compared to a PTZ induced seizure in normal control rat. Method(s): CD was induced through in utero irradiation of 4 pregnant Sprague Dawley rats at E17 with 145 cGy. Fourteen litters (XRT) were implanted with intracortical depth electrodes targeting the right and left frontal and parietal cortex. A set of 27 aged matched normal rats served as controls. All rats were injected with PTZ at 40 mg/kg. Post PTZ injection, all 14 XRT rats developed seizures (Group 1), 17 out of 27 normal rats developed seizures (Group 2) and in 10 normal rats, PTZ injection failed to induce seizures (Group 3). The flow diagram of experimental steps involved is provided in Fig. 1A. To characterize the response of the abnormal/normal brain to PTZ, the average gamma coherence (Cr) across all pairs of electrode and across all rats within a group was computed for the entire duration of recording (24 hours). The Cr profile can be viewed as the impulse response of an over-damped 2nd order system (See Fig.1C), the impulse function being the PTZ injection. The system parameters can then be estimated by fitting Eq.1 to Cr. Result(s): Fig. 1B shows Cr profile and the fitted data for the 3 groups of rats. Table 1, shows the location of poles s1, s2, the under-damped natural frequency (omegan) and the damping ratio of the system (xi). The slow pole s1 represents the long-term effects of the PTZ injection whereas the fast pole s2 dictates the immediate reaction of the system to external perturbation. Note that the slow pole is similar across the 3 groups (Fig. 1D). The location of the pole represents the stability of the system. The location of fast pole is closest to the imaginary axes for XRT rats and hence is suggestive of a less stable system. The lowest damping ratio is for the XRT rat, followed by rats in Group 2 and Group 3. A high damping ratio indicates that the system is resistive to oscillations caused by external perturbations. Conclusion(s): Our study shows that there exists an internal feedback mechanism within the brain of normal rats which reduces its susceptibility to epileptogenesis. We hypothesize that this feedback control mechanism is dysfunctional within the dysplastic (CD) rat brain. Support for this claim is provided by the relatively lower damping ratio and location of the fast pole of the CD rats (p<0.01). Translation of this concept to human studies using neurostimulation paradigms may provide a novel methodology to characterize and measure epileptogenicity in abnormal/normal tissues. Our future work will be targeted along these lines. (Figure Presented).",Excluded,0.99332666
257,"Preclinical MRI reveals anti-VEGF therapy mitigates radiation necrosis. Purpose: Radiation necrosis, a severe but late occurring injury to normal tissue within and surrounding a radiation treatment field, has been described as a slow, continuous process in which increased levels of VEGF-A lead to breakdown of the blood brain barrier [1]. Thus, a strategy that involves blocking VEGF-A from reaching capillaries and repairing ""leaky"" capillaries is a possible therapeutic approach for radiation necrosis. In this work, in concert with a novel mouse model of radiation necrosis [2], the therapeutic effects of the humanized anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech) and the murine anti-VEGF antibody B20-4.1.1 (Genentech) are monitored by magnetic resonance imaging. Method(s): Hemispheric irradiation of mouse brain was performed with the Leksell Gamma Knife PerfexionTM (GK), a state-of-the-art unit used for stereotactic irradiation of patients with malignant brain tumors. Three cohorts of 7-8 week old female mice (n=5) were irradiated with a single 60-Gy dose (50% isodose) of GK radiation. At this dose, the onset of radiation necrosis typically occurs 3-4 weeks post-irradiation. Mouse cohort #1 was an irradiated but untreated control; cohort #2 received bevacizumab (10 mg/kg, twice weekly) from 3-to-10 weeks post-irradiation; cohort #3 received B20- 4.1.1 (10 mg/kg, twice weekly) from 4-to-13 weeks post-irradiation. Mice were imaged from 3-to-10 weeks post-irradiation, using an Agilent/Varian DirectDriveTM 4.7-T small-animal MR scanner. Result(s): The MRI-derived volumes of radiation necrosis for control, bevacizumab-treated, and B20-4.1.1-treated mice are plotted in Fig. 1 as a function of time post-irradiation. Both anti-VEGF antibodies slow the overall rate of progression (p<0.0001, week 10). Considering the initial 3-7 week period postirradiation, bevacizumab has the same mitigative effect as B20-4.1.1 (p = 0.8, week 7). However, for the latter 3-week period (7-10 weeks post-irradiation), radiation-induced necrosis developed at a higher rate than in the B20-4.1.1-treated cohort (p<0.0001, week 10), indicating that the mitigative effect of bevacizumab was weaker than B20-4.1.1 in the late period following the initiation of treatment. Histology results support the MR data. The irradiated hemispheres of the control mice demonstrated many of the classic histologic features of radiation necrosis. In contrast, the irradiated hemisphere of the bevacizumab-treated mouse showed only modest tissue damage and the irradiated hemisphere of the B20-4.1.1-treated mouse displayed no visible tissue damage. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate a significant mitigative effect of bevacizumab and B20-4.1.1 in a mouse model of radiation necrosis, an effect also observed recently in a group of brain-tumor patients treated with bevacizumab [3]. Efforts to verify the mechanism of action of bevacizumab and B20-4.1.1 in the treatment of radiation necrosis in the mouse model are ongoing. (Graph presented).",Excluded,0.9933217

OGG1 (8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1) is one of the main DNA glycosylases present in mammalian cells. The enzyme removes 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) lesions, believed to be the most important oxidized lesions due to their relatively high incidence and their miscoding properties. This study shows that in prenatal mice brains the repair capacity for 8-oxoG is 5-10-fold higher than in adult mice brains. Western blot analysis and repair activity in extracts from Ogg1(-/-) mice revealed that OGG1 was responsible for the efficient 8-oxoG removal from prenatal mice. To investigate how OGG1 protects against oxidative stress-induced mutagenesis, pregnant Big Blue/wild-type and Big Blue/Ogg1(-/-) mice were exposed to nontoxic doses of gamma radiation. A 2.5-fold increase in the mutation frequency in Ogg1(-/-) mouse brains was obtained by exposure to 3.5 Gy at day 19 postfertilization. This was largely due to GC to TA transversions, believed to originate from 8-oxoG mispairing with A during replication. Furthermore, rapid cell divisions seemed to be required for fixation of mutations, as a similar dose of radiation did not increase the mutation frequency, or the frequency of GC to TA transversion, in the adult brain.",Excluded,0.99299276

Distinguishing tumor progression from radiation necrosis after treatment in patients with brain tumors presents a clinical dilemma. A well-characterized, orthotopic rodent model of radiation-induced brain necrosis including a tumor is not currently available The objective of the study was to create focal radiation necrosis in rat brain bearing human glioblastoma (GBM) using stereotactic radiosurgery and confirm it by immuno-histological analysis. Nude rats implanted with primary GBM cells were irradiated using a stereotactic setup (n = 3) or received no radiation (n = 3). Ten weeks after the implantation, growth of the tumor was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For each animal, MRI and contrast-enhanced CT images were obtained and fused using registration software. The tumor was identified and delineated using the fused CT/MR images. A treatment plan was generated using a 4 mm radiosurgery cone such that one portion of the tumor receives 100% dose of 60 Gy sufficient to cause necrosis, whereas the tumor edge at depth receives only 50% or less dose, allowing for regrowth of the tumor. The brains were collected 10 weeks after irradiation and immuno-histological analysis was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed central liquefaction necrosis in the high dose region consistent with necrosis and viable tumor in the peripheral low dose region. Ki-67 staining showed highly proliferative tumor cells surrounding the necrotic parts of the tumor.

483,"Monte Carlo-based dose reconstruction in a rat model for scattered ionizing radiation investigations. PURPOSE: In radiation biology, rats are often irradiated, but the precise dose distributions are often lacking, particularly in areas that receive scatter radiation. We used a non-dedicated set of resources to calculate detailed dose distributions, including doses to peripheral organs well outside of the primary field, in common rat exposure settings.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a detailed dose reconstruction in a rat through an analog to the conventional human treatment planning process. The process consisted of: (i) Characterizing source properties of an X-ray irradiator system, (ii) acquiring a computed tomography (CT) scan of a rat model, and (iii) using a Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation engine to generate the dose distribution within the rat model. We considered cranial and liver irradiation scenarios where the rest of the body was protected by a lead shield. Organs of interest were the brain, liver and gonads. The study also included paired scenarios where the dose to adjacent, shielded rats was determined as a potential control for analysis of bystander effects.RESULTS: We established the precise doses and dose distributions delivered to the peripheral organs in single and paired rats. Mean doses to non-targeted organs in irradiated rats ranged from 0.03-0.1% of the reference platform dose. Mean doses to the adjacent rat peripheral organs were consistent to within 10% those of the directly irradiated rat.CONCLUSIONS: This work provided details of dose distributions in rat models under common irradiation conditions and established an effective scenario for delivering only scattered radiation consistent with that in a directly irradiated rat.",Excluded,0.9905991
602,"Ionizing radiation alters the expression of multifunctional immune-modulatory protein HLA-E in glioblastoma cells lines: An unrecognized effect of radiation therapy?. Background: Immune-modulatory proteins HLA-G and HLA-E were originally thought to be restricted to the protection of the fetus from maternal allorecognition. Now they are known for multiple immune-regulatory functions. We already described production of immune-modulatory molecules HLA-G and HLA-E by both microglial cells (Kren, L. et al., J Neuroimmunol 2010) and neoplastic cells (Kren, L. et al. Neuropathology 2011). We described the unexpected positive correlation of HLA-E expression by neoplastic cells in glioblastoma (GB) with the length of survival, which we hypothetized could be attributable to subsequent therapeutic modalities. Therefore, we decided to analyse the expression of HLA-G and HLA-E in three GB cell lines before and after the impact of ionizing radiation. Design(s): We used three GB cell lines: T 98G, A172 and U 87MG. The expression of HLA-G and HLA-E was assessed before application of ionizing radiation (0-2-5-10-15- 20 Gy) and then was analysed again 24h and 72 h after radiation. HLA-G and HLA-E antigens were analysed flow-cytometrically. Result(s): The expression of both HLA-G and HLA-E by all three cell lines of GB was elevated significantly after irradiation, expecially expression of HLA-E in the line T 98G. (Graph Presented) Conclusion(s): We revealed that expression of HLA-G and HLA-E in GB cell lines alters significantly after the impact of ionizing radiation. This finding may represent a new, unrecognized pathway of the effect of ionizing radiation in cancer therapy. In GB, namely, HLA-E may function, in its elevated levels, as a ligand for activating receptor CD94/NKG2C, therefore mediating increased lysis of tumor cells.",Excluded,0.98952746
534,"Conditionally tumorigenic clone of C6 cells is induced by gamma-irradiation. BACKGROUND: Established cell lines are often heterogeneous in their response to ionizing radiation. The tumorigenicity of some cells can be rapidly induced by gamma-radiation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The tumorigenicity of individual clones of C6 rat glioblastoma cells and the effect of gamma-radiation on their growth in vivo was studied by intracranial implantation into Wistar rats.RESULTS: A clone was found, C6#11, that was conditionally tumorigenic. It either did not form a tumor, or grew into a small encapsulated tumor, and did not cause death or neurological deficits in the animals. Gamma-irradiation of the animals (head only) with implanted C6#11 induced a fully developed invasive tumor that killed them within 25 days. Three grays of radiation of C6#11 cells two hours prior to implantation induced their tumorigenicity as well. The in vitro characteristics of the C6#11 cells as compared to a highly tumorigenic clone did not correlate with their behavior in vivo.CONCLUSION: The C6#11 clone is the first model of an experimental tumor that acquires tumorigenicity in an immuno-competent host immediately after low dose irradiation of the cells.",Excluded,0.98903775
35,"Characterisation of an allosteric modulatory protein associated with alpha-[3H]amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazolepropionate binding sites in chick telencephalon: effects of high-energy radiation and detergent solubilisation. alpha-[3H]Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazolepropionate ([3H]AMPA) binds to 1-day-old chick telencephalon membranes with KD and Bmax values of 138 nM and 2.56 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. High-energy radiation bombardment of intact frozen telencephalon resulted in a biphasic inactivation curve for [3H]AMPA binding. At a 5.8-Mrad radiation dose, the affinity of [3H]AMPA binding was increased (54 nM), but there was no apparent alteration in the Bmax value (2.76 pmol/mg of protein). We attribute this phenomenon to the inactivation of a high molecular weight modulatory protein that down-regulates the affinity of [3H]AMPA binding. The estimated molecular masses of the AMPA binding site and of the modulatory component were 59 and 108 kDa, respectively. Solubilisation with n-octyl-beta-glucopyranoside resulted in an increase in the Bmax (4.7 pmol/mg of protein) with no pronounced alteration in the affinity (109 nM) of [3H]AMPA binding. However, the solubilisation-induced increase in Bmax did not occur in telencephalon irradiated before solubilisation. In contrast, the increase in affinity induced by radiation treatment was still detected in solubilised extracts. These results suggest that the number and affinity of [3H]AMPA sites in chick telencephalon are closely regulated and that the modulatory systems involved are affected by both irradiation and solubilisation.",Excluded,0.987955
167,"Perturbations of cell-cycle progression in gamma-irradiated ataxia telangiectasia and Huntington's disease cells detected by DNA flow cytometric analysis. The effects of ionizing radiation on cell-cycle progression in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from ataxia telangiectasia (AT) and Huntington's disease (HD) patients, and from normal individuals, were studied using DNA flow cytometric analysis. A dose of 100 rad gamma irradiation blocked a proportion of normal and HD cells in G1. A higher radiation dose applied to normal cells increased the number of cells blocked in G1 and significantly delayed cells which were in S at the time of irradiation from reaching G2 DNA content. The reduced cumulative mitotic index in irradiated cultures of normal cells 2 h after irradiation suggests that cells in G2 at the time of irradiation are delayed before entering mitosis. After irradiation HD cells responded similarly to normal cells except that a greater proportion of HD cells were blocked in G1. AT cells do not show the normal delay in progression from G1 to S, or from S to G2 in the first cycle after irradiation. The cumulative mitotic index was reduced in irradiated cells, implying that they are delayed in G2. Thus AT cells did not recognize or respond to signals from damaged DNA which in normal and HD cells caused a proportional block in G1 and an S-phase delay. The only point of arrest in cell-cycle progression in irradiated AT cells was in G2.",Excluded,0.9868508

In this study, we investigated the adhesion and neurite outgrowth of nerve cells on a fluorinated polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation. We used fluorinated polyimide because of its biocompatibility and excellent thermal and mechanical properties for ion irradiation. Rattus norvegicus chromaffin (PC12) cells were used for in vitro studies. The polyimide films were irradiated with He(+), Ne(+), or Kr(+) ions in a fluence range from 10(13) to 10(15) ions/cm(2) at 50 keV. PC12 cells selectively adhered to the polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation. The total neurite length for PC12 cells grown on the Kr(+)-irradiated film was the longest; the neurite length on the film irradiated by Kr(+) after 9 days was approximately five times longer than that for cells grown on the He(+)-irradiated film, i.e., 135 micro m. In addition, the PC12 differentiation rate on the ion-irradiated polyimide films also showed a similar trend to the total neurite length for PC12 cells cultured on the films: the rate decreased in the order Kr(+) > Ne(+) > He(+). This initial study indicated enhanced neurite outgrowth and differentiation of PC12 cells on fluorinated polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation.",Excluded,0.9867073
381,"Fail-Safe Therapy by Gamma-Ray Irradiation Against Tumor Formation by Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Neural Progenitors. Cell replacement therapy holds great promise for Parkinson's disease (PD), but residual undifferentiated cells and immature neural progenitors in the therapy may cause tumor formation. Although cell sorting could effectively exclude these proliferative cells, from the viewpoint of clinical application, there exists no adequate coping strategy in the case of their contamination. In this study, we analyzed a component of proliferative cells in the grafts of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitors and investigated the effect of radiation therapy on tumor formation. In our differentiating protocol, analyses of neural progenitors (day 19) revealed that the proliferating cells expressed early neural markers (SOX1, PAX6) or a dopaminergic neuron progenitor marker (FOXA2). When grafted into the rat striatum, these immature neurons gradually became postmitotic in the brain, and the rosette structures disappeared at 14 weeks. However, at 4-8 weeks, the SOX1(+)PAX6(+) cells formed rosette structures in the grafts, suggesting their tumorigenic potential. Therefore, to develop a fail-safe therapy against tumor formation, we investigated the effect of radiation therapy. At 4 weeks posttransplantation, when KI67(+) cells comprised the highest ratio, radiation therapy with (137)Cs Gammacell Exactor for tumor-bearing immunodeficient rats showed a significant decrease in graft volume and percentage of SOX1(+)KI67(+) cells in the graft, thus demonstrating the preventive effect of gamma-ray irradiation against tumorigenicity.

573,"The interaction of hematoporphyrin derivative, light, and ionizing radiation in a rat glioma model. The effects of hematoporphyrin derivative, light, and cobalt 60 (60Co) irradiation were studied in a rat glioma model using an in vivo and an in vitro clonogenic assay. There was no effect on tumor growth by visible light or by a single dose of 60Co irradiation at 4 Gy or 8 Gy, whereas 16 Gy inhibited tumor growth to 40% versus the control. Hematoporphyrin derivative alone slightly stimulated growth (P less than 0.1). Light in the presence of 10 mg hematoporphyrin derivative/kg inhibited tumor growth to 32%. 60Co irradiation in the presence of hematoporphyrin derivative produced a significant tumor growth inhibition (P less than 0.02). This growth inhibition was directly related to the concentration of hematoporphyrin derivative. The addition of 60Co to light in the presence of hematoporphyrin derivative produced a greater growth inhibition than light or 60Co irradiation alone. This effect was most pronounced when light was applied 30 minutes before 60Co irradiation. Our experiments in a subcutaneous rat glioma model suggest a radiosensitizing effect of hematoporphyrin derivative. Furthermore, the photodynamic inactivation is enhanced by the addition of 60Co irradiation. These findings may be of importance in planning new treatment modalities in malignant brain tumors.",Excluded,0.9857444
125,"Redox balance- and radiation-mediated alteration in hippocampal neurogenesis. Changes in the intracellular and extracellular redox balance have been correlated with cell fate decisions in terms of proliferation versus differentiation, entering versus existing cell cycle and survival versus cell death. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been correlated with neuronal plasticity of learning and memory; however, the process is exquisitely sensitive to changes in redox balance. Cranial irradiation is an effective modality in treating brain tumours but often leads to deficits in hippocampus-related learning and memory, which is most likely due to sustained elevation of oxygen free radical production and suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis. The subcellular redox environment affecting hippocampal neurogenesis is largely unknown. Using mutant mice deficient in each one of the three superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) isoforms, we have begun to determine the consequences of SOD deficiency in hippocampal neurogenesis and the related functions of learning and memory under normal condition and following cranial irradiation.",Excluded,0.9819947
353,"2.45 GHz microwave radiation impairs learning, memory, and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the rat. Microwave (MW) radiation has a close relationship with neurobehavioral disorders. Due to the widespread usage of MW radiation, especially in our homes, it is essential to investigate the direct effect of MW radiation on the central nervous system. Therefore, this study was carried out to determine the effect of MW radiation on memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. The rats were exposed to 2.45 GHz MW radiation (continuous wave with overall average power density of 0.016 mW/cm2 and overall average whole-body specific absorption rate value of 0.017 W/kg) for 2 h/day over a period of 40 days. Spatial learning and memory were tested by radial maze and passive avoidance tests. We evaluated the synaptic plasticity and hippocampal neuronal cells number by field potential recording and Giemsa staining, respectively. Our results showed that MW radiation exposure decreased the learning and memory performance that was associated with decrement of long-term potentiation induction and excitability of CA1 neurons. However, MW radiation did not have any effects on short-term plasticity and paired-pulse ratio as a good indirect index for measurement of glutamate release probability. The evaluation of hippocampal morphology indicated that the neuronal density in the hippocampal CA1 area was significantly decreased by MW.",Excluded,0.97741175

PURPOSE: Radiation/chemoradiotherapy-induced carotid stenosis and cerebrovascular events in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) can cause severe disability and even death. This study aimed to estimate the risk of ischemic stroke in this patient population over more than 10 years of follow-up.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study cohorts consisted of all patients hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of NPC (n=1094), whereas patients hospitalized for an appendectomy during 1997 and 1998 (n=4376) acted as the control group and surrogate for the general population. Cox proportional hazard model was performed as a means of comparing the stroke-free survival rate between the two cohorts after adjusting for possible confounding and risk factors.RESULTS: Of the 292 patients with ischemic strokes, 62 (5.7%) were from the NPC cohort and 230 (5.3%) were from the control group. NPC patients ages 35-54 had a 1.66 times (95% CI, 1.16-2.86; p=0.009) higher risk of ischemic stroke after adjusting for patient characteristics, comorbidities, geographic region, urbanization level of residence, and socioeconomic status.

541,"Does prophylactic cranial irradiation improve overall survival of elderly patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer?. Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has led to improved overall survival (OS) for patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that has responded completely to chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy. However, whether PCI is indicated for elderly patients remains unclear. Method(s): We reviewed 658 patients with limited-stage SCLC treated in 1986-2009 at a single institution with definitive concurrent chemoradiation to a total radiation dose of 45-70 Gy. Variables investigated for possible association with OS included patient sex, age, ethnicity, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score, year of diagnosis and treatment period (1986-1999 vs. 2000-2009), tumor size, radiation dose, cycles of induction chemotherapy, use of intensity-modulated-radiation-therapy (IMRT), and fractionation. Groups were compared with chi-square tests for categorical variables or medians tests for continuous variables. Kaplan-Meier estimates were constructed for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local-recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Result(s): Among 658 patients, 507 patients were <70 years old (Group A) and 151 patients were >=70 years old (Group B). Median survival time was significantly longer in the younger group (25.6 months vs. 20.3 months, P=0.007), but no differences were found in DFS, LRFS, or DMFS time by age. Of the 151 patients aged >=70 years (54 of whom received PCI and 89 did not), those treated in 2000-2009 (vs. 1986-1999) had better brain MFS than those treated in 1986-1999 (P=0.048); those who received PCI had better brain MFS than those who did not (P=0.033). Multivariate analysis showed that among patients aged >=70, receiving PCI, not receiving induction chemotherapy, and local-regional control were associated with fewer brain metastases (for PCI, subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR]=0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.95, P=0.037; for induction chemotherapy, SHR=0.43, 95% CI=0.19-0.96, P=0.039; and for local-regional failure, SHR=0.996, 95% CI=0.993- 0.998, P=0.001). Among patients >=70, receipt of PCI seemed to have been associated with better OS for those with small-volume disease (primary+nodal disease <5 cm, P=0.0545) but not for those with larger-volume disease (P=0.7387). Conclusion(s): Patients aged >=70 years with small-volume limited-stage SCLC seemed to show a benefit in OS from the use of PCI, but those with larger-volume disease did not.

BACKGROUND: Surgery and radiation are the mainstays of therapy for human gliomas that are the most common primary brain tumors. Most recently, cell culture and animal studies provided the first convincing evidence that radiation not only eliminates tumor cells, but also modulates the immune response and likely improves anti-tumor immunotherapy.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present an in vivo study that analyzes the effects of radiation on the immune response in tumor patients. As readout system, we utilized the reactivity of glioma patients' sera against antigen GLEA2 as the most frequent antigen immunogenic in glioblastoma patients. We established an ELISA assay to analyze reactivity of 24 glioblastoma patients over a period of several months. As control we used 30 sera from healthy donors as well as 30 sera from lung cancer patients. We compared the course of GLEA2 seroreactivity at different times prior, during and after radiation. The GLEA2 seroreactivity was increased by the time of surgery, decreased after surgery, increased again under radiation, and slightly decreased after radiation.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide in vivo evidence for an increased antibody response against tumor antigens under radiation.

112,"Prospective multidisciplinary treatment algorithm for head and neck paragangliomas. Purpose/Objective(s): Paragangliomas of the head and neck represent a wide range of predominantly indolent tumors which may cause serious functional deficits if ignored yet its treatment may result in severe iatrogenic morbidity. Surgery and radiation therapy are both established modalities when treatment is warranted but how to integrate these two modalities to optimize tumor control, minimize iatrogenic morbidity and preserve organ function is not clearly established. To this end, a prospective multidisciplinary treatment algorithm was established at our center over the past decade. Patients were diagnosed by anatomic and functional imaging characteristics typically determined by CT/MRI and octreotide avidity. In general, patients who had a solitary carotid body tumor were offered surgery; while those involving the skull base were offered radiation therapy and those with multiple paragangliomas were offered either surgery for the smaller tumor and radiation for the remaining tumors or radiation for all tumors. Materials/Methods: From 1998-2011, 51 patients (42F:9M) were treated with definitive radiation therapy. Median age was 64 years (range, 19-92 year). Paraganglioma subsites were as follows: jugular 44% (n=24), tympanic 20% (n=11), vagal 15% (n=8), carotid body 13% (n=7), parasympathetic 2% (n=1). Two patients had bilateral tumors, while 2 patients had 3 synchronous tumors. The median radiation dose was 45 Gy (21-50.4 Gy) treated with 3D technique in 72% (n=39), IMRT in 20% (n=11) or SBRT 2% (n=1). During this time period, 38 patients underwent primary surgery of whom 6 received adjuvant radiation therapy. Result(s): At a median follow-up of 34 months (4-103 mos), one patient treated with radiation therapy failed at 37 months for a 3 year actuarial LC 100% and 5 year LC 94%. None of the 38 surgically treated failed. Patients who received radiation therapy experienced grade 1/2 complications including mucositis (13%) or xerostomia (23%), and two patients developed dizziness (5%). Of patients who underwent surgical excision, four patients had post-operative cranial nerve deficits, including vocal fold paresis, Horner's syndrome, hearing loss, and temporary facial nerve weakness. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this experience represents the first prospective algorithmic-based multidisciplinary approach with an emphasis on single modality treatment that demonstrates excellent tumor control, low rates of severe iatrogenic morbidity and long-term function preservation. While both surgery and radiation result in excellent tumor control, radiation therapy should be considered a primary treatment for skull-based paraganglioma for which it offers a high therapeutic ratio.",Excluded,0.93997544

Glioblastoma cell line U87-expressing firefly luciferase reporter gene (100,000 cells in 2 mL) was injected intracranially in each SCID mouse. There were 4 treatment groups (n = 8-9, each): brain model (M) without treatment (control), radiation 2Gy weekly (M + R), LipoGat 5 mug/kg dose intraperitoneally twice per week (M + L) and radiation with LipoG(M + R + L). Treatment lasted three weeks. Tumor size was monitored using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), in each mouse. Mice were sacrificed after 3 weeks. Brain was harvested. Lipid peroxidation of brain tissues was quantified by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) as a surrogate biomarker. Survival was evaluated using Kaplan Meier analysis at P= 0.05. RESULT(S): BLI intensity was 4002.03+/-1737.67, 2034+/-737.72, 1387.36+/-684.53 and 2498.89+/-2521.32 % for M, M + R, M+ L and M + R + L, respectively. Tumor size of the M+ L group was reduced by 65% compared to control. There was no significant difference in tumor size of radiated groups compared to control group.MDAbrain concentration inM+ L andM+ R + L groups was significantly less than in M+ R group (8.27+/-0.78 and 10.37+/- 3.30 muM/gm vs. 23.09+/- 3.79 muM/gm). The survival mean was 22.67, 25.33, 25.22 and 27.13 days for M, M+ R, M + R + L and M + L groups, respectively.

487,"Association of Radioactive Iodine Treatment with Cancer Mortality in Patients with Hyperthyroidism. Importance: Radioactive iodine (RAI) has been used extensively to treat hyperthyroidism since the 1940s. Although widely considered a safe and effective therapy, RAI has been associated with elevated risks of total and site-specific cancer death among patients with hyperthyroidism. Objective(s): To determine whether greater organ- or tissue-absorbed doses from RAI treatment are associated with overall and site-specific cancer mortality in patients with hyperthyroidism. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study is a 24-year extension of the multicenter Cooperative Thyrotoxicosis Therapy Follow-up Study, which has followed up US and UK patients diagnosed and treated for hyperthyroidism for nearly 7 decades, beginning in 1946. Patients were traced using records from the National Death Index, Social Security Administration, and other resources. After exclusions, 18805 patients who were treated with RAI and had no history of cancer at the time of the first treatment were eligible for the current analysis. Excess relative risks (ERRs) per 100-mGy dose to the organ or tissue were calculated using multivariable-adjusted linear dose-response models and were converted to relative risks (RR = 1 + ERR). The current analyses were conducted from April 28, 2017, to January 30, 2019. Exposures: Mean total administered activity of sodium iodide I 131 was 375 MBq for patients with Graves disease and 653 MBq for patients with toxic nodular goiter. Mean organ or tissue dose estimates ranged from 20 to 99 mGy (colon or rectum, ovary, uterus, prostate, bladder, and brain/central nervous system), to 100 to 400 mGy (pancreas, kidney, liver, stomach, female breast, lung, oral mucosa, and marrow), to 1.6 Gy (esophagus), and to 130 Gy (thyroid gland). Main Outcomes and Measures: Site-specific and all solid-cancer mortality. Result(s): A total of 18805 patients were included in the study cohort, and the mean (SD) entry age was 49 (14) years. Most patients were women (14671 [78.0%]), and most had a Graves disease diagnosis (17615 [93.7%]). Statistically significant positive associations were observed for all solid cancer mortality (n = 1984; RR at 100-mGy dose to the stomach = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10; P =.002), including female breast cancer (n = 291; RR at 100-mGy dose to the breast = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.003-1.32; P =.04) and all other solid cancers combined (n = 1693; RR at 100-mGy dose to the stomach = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10; P =.01). The 100-mGy dose to the stomach and breast corresponded to a mean (SD) administered activity of 243 (35) MBq and 266 (58) MBq in patients with Graves disease. For every 1000 patients with hyperthyroidism receiving typical doses to the stomach (150 to 250 mGy), an estimated lifetime excess of 19 (95% CI, 3-40) to 32 (95% CI, 5-66) solid cancer deaths could occur. Conclusions and Relevance: In RAI-treated patients with hyperthyroidism, greater organ-absorbed doses appeared to be modestly positively associated with risk of death from solid cancer, including breast cancer. Additional studies are needed of the risks and advantages of all major treatment options available to patients with hyperthyroidism. Copyright Â© 2019 American Medical Association.

Background Intracranial meningeal hemangiopericytoma (HPC) represents a rare and aggressive intracranial neoplasm located along the dural sinuses. It constitutes less than 1 % of all intracranial tumors and approximately 2-4 % of all meningeal tumors. The authors present our institute's experience in combined modality management of 15 successive patients of HPC. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 15 patients of HPC treated in our institute from 2001 to 2011. Clinical characteristics and treatment modality, in the form of surgery and radiotherapy, were noted. Statistical analysis was done with regards to recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results The median age of the patients was 40.0 years. Nine patients were males and six patients were females. The median duration of symptoms was six months. Headache was the most common presenting symptom followed by vomiting, motor weakness and seizures. Twelve patients underwent total excision while three had subtotal excision. Seven patients had WHO grade II histology tumors and eight patients had grade III histology. Thirteen patients received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). Median RT dose delivered was 50 Gy. Five patients developed local recurrence. One patient had distant metastases. Median duration of RFS was 68 months. Conclusions HPCs are aggressive tumors. The mainstay of therapy is gross total resection at the initial surgery. Postoperative adjuvant RT should be offered to all patients, regardless of the degree of resection achieved. Long-term followup is important as local recurrences and distant metastases can develop years after the initial treatment. Â© Springer-Verlag 2012.",Excluded,0.9141807
104,"Effect of protons on the mechanical response of rat muscle nociceptive fibers and neurons in vitro. Strong exercise makes muscle acidic, and painful. The stimulus that activates muscle nociceptors in such instance may be protons. Reportedly, however, not many afferents are excited by protons alone.

We examined effects of protons on mechanical sensitivity of muscle nociceptors by single-fiber recording from rat muscle-nerve preparations in vitro and by whole cell patch-clamp recording of mechanically activated (MA) currents from cultured rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. We recorded 38 Adelta- and C-fibers. Their response magnitude was increased by both pH 6.2 and pH 6.8; in addition the mechanical threshold was lowered by pH 6.2. Decrease in the threshold by pH6.2 was also observed in MA currents.

When the organism was subjected to gamma irradiation in phosphate buffer, the induction dose and D10 values were 846 and 345 krad, respectively, for cells grown on PCNZ agar, and 700 and 460 krad, respectively, for the enlarged cells grown on 5% (v/v) horse blood brain heart infusion agar. The D10 value of the former cells was about 1.8 times higher than that of Micrococcus radiodurans grown on PCNZ agar.",Excluded,0.89567554
174,"Re-evaluation of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited-stage small cell lung cancer: a propensity score matched analysis. We attempted to re-evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) with more recent data. A total of 179 patients with LS-SCLC received radical thoracic radiotherapy and chemotherapy at our institution between 1998 and 2018. One hundred twenty-eight patients who achieved complete response (CR), good partial response (PR), and PR without progression for at least for one year after initial therapy were enrolled in this study. These patients were divided into a PCI group (group A, n=43), and a non-PCI group (group B, n=85). Survival outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. Because several background factors differed significantly between groups A and B, propensity score (PS) matching was performed as 1:1 match of the two groups. Finally, we analyzed 64 patients (group A/B=32/32). Median follow-up periods were 53 and 31 months in groups A and B, respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups' backgrounds. Two-year overall survival (OS) rates were 77% in group A and 62% in group B (p=0.224). Two-year brain metastasis free survival (BMFS) rates were 85% in group A and 57% in group B (p=0.008). The number of patients who underwent a brain imaging test for confirmation of no brain metastasis (BM) after radical thoracic radiotherapy and chemotherapy (before PCI) was 84 (group A/B=32/52). A PS matched analysis for cases of pre-PCI brain imaging group, two-year OS rates for group A/B were 73/59% (p=0.446). Two-year BMFS rates for group A/B were 91/52% (p=0.021). Retrospectively, PS matched analysis revealed that adding PCI to LS-SCLC patients who achieved good thoracic control significantly improved BMFS, but OS did not improve.

516,"2MO Radiotherapy in cancer is associated with a deletion signature that contributes to poor patient outcomes. Background: Diffuse gliomas are highly aggressive brain tumors that invariably relapse despite treatment with chemo- and radiotherapy. Treatment with alkylating chemotherapy can drive tumors to develop a hypermutator phenotype. In contrast, the genomic effects of radiation therapy (RT) remain unknown. Method(s): We analyzed the mutational spectra following treatment with ionizing radiation in sequencing data from 190 paired primary-recurrent gliomas from the Glioma Longitudinal Analysis (GLASS) dataset and 2249 post-treatment metastatic tumors from the Hartwig Medical Foundation. Result(s): We identified a significant increase in the burden of small deletions following radiation therapy that was independent of other factors. These novel deletions demonstrated distinct characteristics when compared to pre-existing deletions present prior to RT-treatment and deletions in RT-untreated tumors. Radiation therapy-acquired deletions were characterized by a larger deletion size (GLASS and metastatic cohort, P=1.2e-02 and P=8e-11, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test), an increased distance to repetitive DNA elements (P<2.2e-16, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and a reduction in microhomology at breakpoints (P=3.2e-02, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These observations suggested that canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) was the preferred pathway for DNA double strand break repair of RT-induced DNA damage. Furthermore, radiotherapy resulted in frequent chromosomal deletions and significantly increased frequencies of CDKN2A homozygous deletions. Finally, a high burden of RT-associated deletions was associated with worse clinical outcomes (GLASS and metastatic cohort, P=4.7e-02, HR=2.59 [95% CI: 1.01, 6.60] and P=2.5e-02, HR=1.43 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.94], respectively; multivariable Cox regression). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that effective repair of RT-induced DNA damage is detrimental to patient survival and that inhibiting c-NHEJ may be a viable strategy for improving the cancer-killing effect of radiotherapy. Taken together, the identified genomic scars as a result of radiation therapy reflect a more aggressive tumor with increased levels of resistance to follow up treatments.
