554,Low Dose Brain Irradiation Reduces Amyloid-beta and Tau in 3xTg-AD Mice. We have previously reported that low doses of external beam ionizing irradiation reduced amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and improved cognition in APP/PS1 mice. In this study we investigated the effects of radiation in an age-matched series of 3xTg-AD mice. Mice were hemibrain-irradiated with 5 fractions of 2 Gy and sacrificed 8 weeks after the end of treatment. Abeta and tau were assessed using immunohistochemistry and quantified using image analysis with Definiens Tissue Studio. We observed a significant reduction in Abeta plaque burden and tau staining; these two parameters were significantly correlated. This preliminary data is further support that low doses of radiation may be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease.,Excluded,0.98633194

396,"The analgesic effect of low dose focal irradiation in a mouse model of bone cancer is associated with spinal changes in neuro-mediators of nociception. Despite the widespread use of radiotherapy to treat painful bone metastases, the mechanism underlying the analgesic effect of low dose ionizing radiation is unknown. Bone cancer pain is mostly associated with an inflammatory response dominated by local activation of osteoclasts and by astrogliosis in the spinal cord. We determined the effects of a 6 Gy irradiation given focally on osteolytic sarcoma cells inoculated in humeri of mice. Pain behavior was assessed using the rota-rod and the grip force test. Seven days post-irradiation (day 17 post-tumor implantation) the performance of mice markedly improved on the rotarod (non-irradiated, 67+/-16s vs irradiated, 223 +/- 22 s; P = 0.0005), and the grip force test (non-irradiated, 34 +/- 4 g vs irradiated, 55 +/- 2 g; P = 0.001). This improvement was similar to the analgesia achieved with 30 mg/kg of the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ketorolac (Rota-rod, 67 +/- 16 s vs 178 +/- 35 s; P = 0.01: grip force test, 34 +/- 4 g, vs 60 +/- 5 g; P = 0.003). Following irradiation, the tumor mass and the number of osteoclasts did not decrease while the expression of two pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) increased. Tumor irradiation led to clear differences in the spinal cord. These include a decrease in glial activity (astrocytes and microglial cells) as well as pain mediators such as dynorphin, COX-2 and chemotactic cytokine receptor (CCR2). We conclude that the analgesic effect of low dose irradiation of bone cancer is associated with the alteration of nociceptive transmission in the central nervous system.",Excluded,0.98606896
382,"Effect of in utero irradiation on the postnatal development, behavior, and brain structure of rats: Dose fractionation with a 6-h interval. Based on previous studies showing that exposure of the rat fetus to ionizing radiation produces dose-dependent (0.25-1.25 Gy) changes in postnatal development of behavior and decreases in the thickness of the cerebral cortex, we examined the extent to which dose fractionation would reduce expression of damage. Pregnant rats were exposed to single doses of 0.5 or 1.0 Gy, or to two doses of 0.5 Gy 6 h apart on day 15 of gestation. Offspring were subjected to four behavioral tests on postnatal days 7-28; the rats were then sacrificed and their brains removed and processed for histology. For all end points, the fractionated dose produced an effect that was intermediate between that of the 0.5- and 1.0-Gy doses and which, by interpolation, could be expressed as equivalent to a single dose between 0.5 and 1.0 Gy. The equivalent single dose was not significantly different from the 1.0-Gy dose for negative geotaxis (0.54 Gy), reflex suspension (0.80 Gy), and continuous corridor (0.85 Gy). For sine of the angle of the advance of hind feet (0.58 Gy), width of stride (0.69 Gy), length of stride (0.75 Gy), body weight (0.73 Gy), and cerebral cortex thickness (0.69 Gy), the fractionated dose produced effects significantly different (P < 0.05) from the 1.0-Gy dose. Overall, exposure of fetal rats to two doses of 0.5 Gy separated by 6 h produced effects equivalent to a single dose of 0.70 Gy, as measured by postnatal behavioral tests and morphological assessment of brain structure.",Excluded,0.98606014
606,"Cognitive impairment and spontaneous epilepsy in rats with malformations of cortical development. Purpose: To examine the cognition, spontaneous epilepsy, and electroencephalography (EEG) characteristics of rats with malformations of cortical development (MCD) and their use as an animal model for investigating the pathogenesis of intractable epilepsy and screening novel antiepileptic drugs. Method(s): An epileptic rat model of MCD was established with the F1 generation of pregnant rats after X-irradiation with 175 cGy (Group L), 195 cGy (Group M), or 215 cGy (Group H). Long-term video-EEG monitoring was used to record the seizures in the rats with MCD. Cognition was assessed with the Morris water maze. The EEGs were recorded and analyzed in the frontal and parietal lobes and hippocampi of adult rats. Finally, the brain tissues were processed for Nissl staining. Result(s): The model groups exhibited markedly prolonged escape latencies and distinct decrements in the percent distance traveled in the target quadrant and platform-crossing frequency. These findings were dose-dependent. Frequent interictal epileptiform discharges were observed in the frontal and parietal lobes and hippocampi of adult rats, and their incidences were markedly higher in the model groups compared with that in the normal controls, with Group M having the highest incidence. Spontaneous seizures were observed in the model groups (mean incidence, 46.7%). The daily mean frequency of seizures and the incidence of spontaneous seizures were highest in Group M. Nissl staining revealed a dose-dependent pattern of hippocampal abnormalities, cortical and subcortical nodular heterotopia, and callosal agenesis in the model groups. Conclusion(s): The 195 cGy dose was most appropriate for establishing an epileptic model of MCD with X-irradiation. Copyright © 2015 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

716,"Effects of irradiation on brain vasculature using an in situ tumor model. PURPOSE: Damage to normal tissue is a limiting factor in clinical radiotherapy (RT). We tested the hypothesis that the presence of tumor alters the response of normal tissues to irradiation using a rat in situ brain tumor model.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Intravital microscopy was used with a rat cranial window to assess the in situ effect of rat C6 glioma on peritumoral tissue with and without RT. The RT regimen included 40 Gy at 8 Gy/day starting Day 5 after tumor implant. Endpoints included blood-brain barrier permeability, clearance index, leukocyte-endothelial interactions and staining for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) glial fibrillary acidic protein, and apoptosis. To characterize the system response to RT, animal survival and tumor surface area and volume were measured. Sham experiments were performed on similar animals implanted with basement membrane matrix absent of tumor cells.RESULTS: The presence of tumor alone increases permeability but has little effect on leukocyte-endothelial interactions and astrogliosis. Radiation alone increases tissue permeability, leukocyte-endothelial interactions, and astrogliosis. The highest levels of permeability and cell adhesion were seen in the model that combined tumor and irradiation; however, the presence of tumor appeared to reduce the volume of rolling leukocytes. Unirradiated tumor and peritumoral tissue had poor clearance. Irradiated tumor and peritumoral tissue had a similar clearance index to irradiated and unirradiated sham-implanted animals. Radiation reduces the presence of VEGF in peritumoral normal tissues but did not affect the amount of apoptosis in the normal tissue. Apoptosis was identified in the tumor tissue with and without radiation.CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel approach to demonstrate that the presence of the tumor in a rat intracranial model alters the response of normal tissues to irradiation.",Excluded,0.98571

We cloned the rat Gadd45 (growth arrest and DNA damage inducible) cDNA and examined its mRNA induction by gamma-ray irradiation in the rat brain. The rat Gadd45 cDNA sequence was highly homologous to the previously published human and hamster cDNAs, and was partially similar to the 28S rRNA gene. The mRNA encoding rat GADD45 was induced in the brain after gamma-ray irradiation. This finding indicates that Gadd45 is an inducible gene following the ionizing radiation, not only in cultured cells in vitro, but also in animal tissues in vivo.",Excluded,0.9854998

Thermotropic behavior of liposomes exposed to gamma-radiation was studied by differential scanning microcalorimetry. It was found that the peak corresponding to the gel-liquid crystal transition for liposomes composed of bovine brain sphingomyelin and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglycerol broadened and shifted toward the high-temperature region. No effect of irradiation on dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes was observed. Previously it was shown that, on exposure to gamma-rays, sphingomyelin and phosphatidylglycerol, as opposed to phosphatidylcholine, broke down into fragments of lower molecular weight. It is concluded that the accumulation of products of phospholipid fragmentation in the membrane results in the changes of phase transition parameters.",Excluded,0.9844285

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The recurrence rate in skull base is high for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement. This study was conducted to explore the impact of dose boost in skull base on the recurrence in skull base and survival of NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement. METHOD(S): A total of 120 stage T4 NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement proved by histopathology and computed tomography (CT) were treated in our hospital from Oct. 1996 to Nov. 1998. The irradiation dose was (71.55+/-3.09) Gy in nasopharynx and (58.95+/-6.16) Gy in neck. Of the 120 patients, 27 received irradiation (6-10 Gy) in skull base after radiotherapy (boost group), 93 did not receive irradiation in skull base (control group). Fifty-three patients, 41 in control group and 12 in boost group, received cisplatin-based chemotherapy for 1-3 cycles. The survival rates and the recurrence of the 2 groups were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. RESULT(S): The clinical characteristics of patients were similar in the 2 groups. The 1-, 3-, 5-year skull base control rates were significantly higher in boost group than in control group (100% vs. 93.4%, 91.8% vs. 76.4%, and 86.8% vs. 65.1%, respectively, P=0.045). The 1-, 3-, 5-year disease-freely survival rates were slightly higher in boost group than in control group (85.2% vs. 75.3%, 59.3% vs. 45.2%, and 51.9% vs. 31.2%, respectively, P=0.084). The median disease-freely survival time was longer in boost group than in control group (60 months vs. 30 months). The prevalences of irradiation-induced brain damage were 7.4% in boost group and 4.3% in control group with no significant difference (P=0.514). CONCLUSION(S): Dose boost in skull base can reduce the recurrence of stage T4 NPC in skull base and tends to enhance the disease-freely survival rate for NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvementu it is recommended to such patients.",Excluded,0.9545135

21,"Antioxidative and antiapoptotic genes expression in irradiated leukemia cells upon fullerenol nanoparticle treatment. Recent data established the prospective applications for fullerenol (C<inf>60</inf>(OH)<inf>24</inf>) nanoparticle (FNP) in many fields, such as antioxidants, neuroprotective agents, and potential anti-radiation drugs. Leukemia cell sensitization to apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation is achieved by upregulation of ROS production and/or downregulation of antioxidative enzymes. Therefore, our aim was to analyze the potential role of fullerenol nanoparticle in modulation of the leukemic cellular response to irradiation. We used the qRT-PCR to analyze the expression level of mRNA for 11 genes in irradiated (IR) and FNP pre-treated irradiated cells (FNP + IR) K562 cells, and compared gene expression level with the overall cell survival, determined by DET and MTT assays. Interesting result of similar percentage of cell survival in FNP and FNP + IR groups (67.9% versus 63%), indicated the possible protective effect of FNP in irradiated cells. Under oxidative stress induced by radiation, cytoprotective genes such as GSTA4, MnSOD, NOS, CAT and HO-1 were upregulated in FNP pretreated K562 cells in comparison with control group, IR and FNP - treated non-irradiated cells. Amongst the antioxidative enzymes, only the mRNA of Cu, Zn - SOD (SOD-1) was downregulated, while gGT, GPX and GSTP1 were not significantly modulated in FNP-treated irradiated cells. Together with survival data and significant overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL genes, our results may indicate that FNP exerts cytoprotective function in K562 leukemic cells, rendering K562 cells more tolerant to radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.92660356
717,"A rodent in situ glioma allograft model to study bone marrow-derived cell migration. Radiotherapy (RT) induced hypoxia recruits bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) to tumors through the upregulation of Stromal Derived Factor-1, a chemokine that binds to receptor CXCR4 present on BMDCs. The infiltration of BMDCs, which includes endothelial progenitors, pericyte progenitors, tumor-associated macrophages, immature monocytes, VEGFR<sup>+</sup> hemangiocytes, and CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells has been implicated in supporting tumor establishment by contributing to tumor growth, angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, inflammation, and immune suppression. In this work, we have used a rodent glioma in situ allograft model to study the recruitment/migration of BMDCs post RT. Female albino C57 (8-10 weeks old, Jackson Laboratories) animals underwent +DsRed bone marrow transplant (B6.Cg-Tg(CAG-DsRed*MST)1Nagy/J donor mouse). Following engraftment, glioma cells were cranially implanted with 1x10 glioma cells (GL261-Luc, Perkin Elmer), at an average size of 26.4mm indicated by a bioluminescence signal of 5.28x10 photons/sec/cm/sr, animals underwent 6Gy (RadSource 2000, 250kVp, 25mA) of irradiation limited to a 1cm wide slit centered on the tumor. Bioluminescence (tumor size) and fluorescence imaging (+DsRed BMDCs) was performed prior to and at 1-and 2-weeks post-RT to assess tumor growth and measure the influx of +DsRed BMDCs. In addition, flow cytometry was used to measure the number of +DsRed BMDCs in the tumor and brain. To study the effect of BMDCs in tumor regression, tumors were irradiated at a smaller size (9.3mm) with 10Gy irradiation. At 1-week post-RT, flow cytometry was used to measure the number of BMDCs (CD45+) in the tumor. In our model 6Gy radiation was able to stall the growth of the tumor. Irradiated tumors did not significantly change in tumor size at either 1-or 2-weeks post irradiation compared to pre-RT size. In addition, irradiated tumors were significantly smaller than untreated tumors (p=0.0008) 1-week post-RT. Using flow cytometry 1-week post irradiation, we observed a significant increase in the number of +DsRed BMDCs in the irradiated tumor (23.5% of cells +DsRed BMDCs) compared to the irradiated brain (6.17% cells +DsRed BMDCs, p=0.03) as well as a significant increase in the tumors (16.6% cells +DsRed BMDCs) compared to the brain (11.1% cells +DsRed BMDCs p=0.02). There was no difference in the number of +DsRed BMDCS in tumors +/- irradiation or brains +/- irradiation. We found similar results in our tumor regression model using flow cytometry 1-week post-RT; we observed an increase in the number of BMDCs CD45+ in the tumor (~20% of cells CD45+) compared to control tumors (~6% of cells CD45+). Indicating that tumor size at the onset of RT did not effect the migration of BMDCs. Fluorescence imaging did not measure any significant change in the DsRed signal at 1-or 2-weeks post-irradiation. We have successfully shown that post-RT there is an increase in BMDCs migration at 1-week post RT regardless of tumor size at RT. Further experimentation is needed to better elucidate the role of BMDCs in tumor inflammation and immune suppression as well as angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Our next step is to perform immunohistochemistry on our collected tumor tissue to map out the spatial location of migrated BMDCs within the tumor.",Excluded,0.926451
431,"Repeat intracoronary radiation for recurrent in-stent restenosis in patients who failed intracoronary radiation. BACKGROUND: Intracoronary radiation therapy (IRT) is the only proven treatment for in-stent restenosis (ISR). It is, however, associated with a significant failure rate. The present study evaluated the outcomes of patients who underwent repeat intracoronary radiation for recurrent ISR.METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-one consecutive patients who failed a previous radiation treatment, presented with angina and angiographic evidence of ISR, and were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and repeat radiation to the same segment were studied. Twenty-five patients were treated with gamma radiation in a dose of 15 Gy, and 26 were treated with beta radiation doses of 18.3 to 23 Gy. The mean cumulative dose for this cohort was 39.5+/-11.9 Gy (range, 29 to 75.6 Gy). The outcomes of those patients were compared with outcomes of 299 patients who also failed initial radiation but were treated with repeat conventional PCI to a previously irradiated segment without repeat radiation. At 9 months after treatment, the repeat-IRT group had lower rates of target lesion revascularization (23.5% versus 54.6%; P<0.001) and major adverse cardiac events, including target vessel revascularization (29.4% versus 61.3%; P<0.001). At 9 months, patients with repeat IRT were free of angiographic and clinical events related to the radiation therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Repeat gamma or beta radiation to treat failed IRT for ISR after conventional PCI is safe and effective at 9 months and should be considered as a therapeutic option for this difficult patient subset.",Excluded,0.8768318
51,"Irradiation induced clonogenic cell death of human malignant glioma cells does not require CD95/CD95L interactions. BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is the single most effective therapy for malignant gliomas. Targeting the CD95 apoptotic pathway is a promising experimental approach to these neoplasms. Here, we asked whether irradiation modulates CD95-mediated apoptosis of human malignant glioma cells in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODS: LN-18, LN-229 and T98G human malignant glioma cell lines were irradiated with dosages from 0-8 Gy and treated with CD95L (CD95 ligand). CD95 expression was assessed by flow cytometry. Caspase activity was determined by DEVD cleavage. Cytotoxic effects were assessed by crystal violet staining of cells in a 96-well plate assay. Clonogenic cell death was determined by a standard colony forming assay.RESULTS: We find that (i) CD95L-induced apoptosis, but not irradiation-induced clonogenic cell death, involves caspase 3 activation and is blocked by the viral caspase inhibitor, crm-A. (ii) Irradiation does not modulate CD95 expression either in p53 wild-type or in p53 mutant glioma cell lines, and does not enhance CD95L-evoked caspase 3 activity or CD95L-induced clonogenic cell death.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that endogenous CD95/CD95L interactions are not involved in radiation-induced clonogenic cell death and that the killing cascades of CD95L and irradiation are independent in human malignant glioma cells.",Excluded,0.8573252

The cells were irradiated with a neuron beam using the accelerator-based epithermal neuron source. A clonogenic assay was used to evaluate the viability of the irradiated cells. The absorbed doses obtained from elastic scattering of fast neutrons by substance nuclei and the doses obtained from boron neutron capture were calculated using the NMS code. The absorbed doses of gamma-radiation were measured with a mixed radiation dosimeter.Results: The viability of boron-containing and intact human U251 and T98G cell lines and Chinese hamster CHO-K1 and V-79 cells was analyzed after neutron beam radiation. Irradiation of all four cell lines were cultured in the presence of 10B was shown to reduce their colony-forming capacity compared with the control.

112,"Irradiation and hypoxia promote homing of haematopoietic progenitor cells towards gliomas by TGF-beta-dependent HIF-1alpha-mediated induction of CXCL12. Previously we defined a pathway of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and stromal cell-derived factor-1/CXC chemokine ligand 12 (SDF-1alpha/CXCL12) dependent migration of adult haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPC) towards glioma cells in vitro and their homing to experimental gliomas in vivo. Hypoxia is a critical aspect of the microenvironment of gliomas and irradiation is an essential part of the standard therapy. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of HPC as vectors for a cell-based therapy of gliomas, we investigated the impact of hypoxia and irradiation on the attraction of HPC by glioma cells. Temozolomide (TMZ) treatment and hyperthermia served as controls. Supernatants of irradiated or hypoxic LNT-229 glioma cells promote HPC migration in vitro. Reporter assays reveal that the CXCL12 promoter activity is enhanced in LNT-229 cells at 24 h after irradiation at 8 Gy or after exposure to 1% oxygen for 12 h. The irradiation- and hypoxia-induced release of CXCL12 depends on hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha), but not on p53. Induction of transcriptional activity of HIF-1alpha by hypoxia or irradiation requires an intact TGF-beta signalling cascade. This delineates a novel stress signalling cascade in glioma cells involving TGF-beta, HIF-1alpha and CXCL12. Stress stimuli can be irradiation, hypoxia or TMZ, but not hyperthermia. Cerebral irradiation of nude mice at 21 days after intracerebral implantation of LNT-229 glioma induces tumour satellite formation and enhances the glioma tropism of HPC to the tumour bulk and even to these satellites in vivo. These data suggest that the use of HPC as cellular vectors in the treatment of glioblastoma may well be combined with irradiation or other anti-angiogenic therapies that induce tumour hypoxia.",Excluded,0.7072418
339,"Sequelae in long-term survivors of small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: Central nervous system (CNS) effects of chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) are studied in long-term small cell lung cancer (SCLC) survivors. The exact significance and pathogenesis of the neurotoxicity is still unknown, as studies on this subject lack sufficient patient numbers and are performed in an extremely varied manner.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-nine survivors (> 2 years from diagnosis) were examined neurologically and neuropsychologically, and underwent a cranial computer tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance (MR). Eight patients were excluded from further analysis for various reasons (not SCLC-related CNS disease, n = 6; no chemotherapy nor PCI treatment, n = 2). The remaining 51 patients were divided into three groups; group 1 = chemotherapy alone (n = 21), group 2 = sequential PCI (n = 19), and group 3 = concurrent or sandwiched PCI (n = 11). Groups were neuropsychologically compared in matched controls.RESULTS: Performance status did not differ significantly between various treatment groups; all patients remained ambulatory and capable of self-care. Mental impairment (n = 20), motor abnormalities (n = 9), and visual complaints (n = 1), were found in five patients in group 1 (24%), eight patients in group 2 (42%), and eight patients in group 3 (73%). Analysis of brain atrophy revealed no significant results; however, white matter abnormalities were found more frequently in group 3. Neuropsychologically no significant group differences existed, although interference sensitivity and difficulties with divided attention tended to occur more frequently in patients treated with PCI. Mean neuropsychometric results of treatment groups were significantly worse than those of matched controls.CONCLUSIONS: Although more intensively treated patients showed more neurologic impairment and patients in group 3 had more white matter abnormalities, there was no statistic evidence for additional neurotoxicity of PCI. Marked neuropsychometric differences between patients and matched controls may indicate that cognitive impairment is partly disease related, probably due to emotional distress and deteriorated physical condition.",Excluded,0.7030855
476,"[Timing of Brain Radiation Therapy Impacts Outcomes in Patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Who Develop Brain Metastases]. BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy or molecular targeted therapy remains the standard of treatment for brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study is to determine if the deferral of brain radiotherapy impacts patient outcomes.METHODS: Between May 2003 and December 2015, a total of 198 patients with brain metastases from NSCLC who received both brain radiotherapy and systemic therapy (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) were identified. The rate of grade 3-4 adverse reactions related to chemotherapy and radiotherapy had no significant difference between two groups. 127 patients received concurrent brain radiotherapy and systemic therapy, and 71 patients received deferred brain radiotherapy after at least two cycles of chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Disease specific-graded prognostic assessment was similar in early radiotherapy group and deferred radiotherapy group.RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) was longer in early radiotherapy group compared to deferred radiotherapy group (17.9 months vs 12.6 months; P=0.038). Progression free survival (PFS) was also improved in patients receiving early radiotherapy compared to those receiving deferred radiotherapy (4.0 months vs 3.0 months; P<0.01). Receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy after the diagnosis of brain metastases as any line therapy improved the OS (20.0 months vs 10.7 months; P<0.01), whereas receiving TKI as first line therapy did not (17.9 months vs 15.2 months; P=0.289).CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the use of deferred brain radiotherapy may resulted in inferior OS in patients with NSCLC who develop brain metastases.

BACKGROUND: Radon therapy is clinically useful for the treatment of pain-related diseases. However, there have been no studies regarding the effects of radon inhalation on neuropathic pain. In this study, we aimed to determine whether radon inhalation actually induced a remission of neuropathic pain and improved the quality of life.METHODS: First, we investigated the antinociceptive effects of radon inhalation in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain. We evaluated pain behaviour in mice before and after CCI surgery, using von Frey test. Pretreated mice received CCI surgery immediately after 24-h inhalation of radon at background (BG) concentration (c. 19 Bq/m(3) ), or at a concentration of 1000 or 2000 Bq/m(3) , and post-treated mice inhaled similar levels of radon 2 days after CCI surgery.RESULTS: CCI surgery induced mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia on a plantar surface of mice, as assessed using von Frey test, and 2000 Bq/m(3) radon inhalation alleviated hyperalgesic conditions 22-37% compared to BG level concentration. Concurrently, CCI surgery increased norepinephrine (NE), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations in plasma, and leukocyte migration in paws. Furthermore, CCI-induced neuropathy reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Treatment with radon inhalation, specifically at a concentration of 2000 Bq/m(3) , produced antinociceptive effects, i.e., lowered plasma TNF-alpha, NE and NO levels and restored SOD activity, as well as pain-related behaviour.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that inhalation of 2000 Bq/m(3) radon prevented and alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain in mice.",Excluded,0.6594107

The RFs emanated from dipole antennas (1 W average output) 2.0 +/- 0.5 cm from the tip of each rat's nose. The RFs had an 860 MHz frequency, and the specific absorption rate was 1.0 W/ kg averaged over the brain. Fifteen groups of 60 rats (900 total) were formed from offspring of females injected i.v. with 0 (groups 1, 2, 9, 10, 13), 2.5 (groups 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14) or 10 mg/kg (groups 3, 4, 15) ethylnitrosourea (ENU) to induce brain tumors. Groups 1, 3, 5 and 7 received the PRF, and groups 9 and 11 the CWRF; groups 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 were sham-irradiated, and groups 13-15 were cage controls. All rats but 2, totaling 898, were necropsied, and major tissues were studied histopathologically. There was no statistically significant evidence that the PRF or CWRF induced neoplasia in any tissues. Additionally, there was no significant evidence of promotion of cranial or spinal nerve or spinal cord tumors. The PRF or CWRF had no statistically significant effect on the number, volume, location, multiplicity, histological type, malignancy or fatality of brain tumors. There was a trend for the group that received a high dose of ENU and was exposed to the PRF to develop fatal brain tumors at a higher rate than its sham group; however, the result was not significant using the log-rank test (P = 0.14, 2-tailed). No statistically significant differences were related to the PRF or CWRF compared to controls in the low- or zero-dose groups regarding tumors of any kind. © 2001 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.65721345
677,"Enhancement of sodium borocaptate (BSH) uptake by tumor cells induced by glutathione depletion and its radiobiological effect. Sodium borocaptate (BSH) is widely used for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) of brain tumors. However, the mechanism of uptake by the tumor remains unclear. We investigated the sulfhydryl moiety of this compound. Down regulation of glutathione (GSH) by buthionine sulfoximine in cultured cells resulted in increase of BSH uptake (7.9-36.5%) compared to the control group and consequently the cytocidal effect of neutron irradiation also increased. On the other hand, the radiation caused damage by gamma-ray irradiation was suppressed when BSH uptake increased. These findings suggested that modulation of GSH enhanced the effect of B (n, alpha) reaction and the protective effect of secondary gamma-ray in BNCT.",Excluded,0.5956274

322,"Effect of alkali on the size dispersity of mammalian DNA measured by filter elution. DNA from unirradiated and irradiated cultured 9L rat brain tumor cells was held for varying times in low ionic strength solutions at pH 11.0, 12.3, or 12.9. The effect of this exposure to alkali on the DNA size distribution was determined by comparing the DNA filter elution profiles obtained experimentally with those theoretically predicted for monodispersed and random distributions. At pH 12.3 or 12.9, DNA from cells irradiated with 300 rad eluted with first-order kinetics corresponding to a random DNA size distribution. The median size of the distribution decreased if the irradiated DNA was exposed to pH 12.3 for 24 h. At pH 12.3 or 12.9, DNA from unirradiated cells eluted initially with complex kinetics that later became linear (18-21 h for pH 12.3 or 13-15 h for pH 12.9), characteristic of a monodispersed DNA size distribution. Holding either unirradiated or irradiated DNA at pH 11.0, below the critical unwinding pH, produced no effect on the elution profiles. Analysis of these filter elution data indicated that after sufficient exposure to pH 12.3 or 12.9, undamaged DNA molecules from mammalian cells elute as a single-stranded monodispersed size distribution of approximately 1 X 10(10) daltons. While the possibility cannot be completely eliminated that this monodispersed size represents an upper limit determined by physical forces, these results, in conjunction with those obtained using other techniques, lend credence to the existence of a nonrandom higher-order structure in mammalian chromosomal DNA.",Excluded,0.52693427
