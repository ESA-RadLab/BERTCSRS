0,"ASCO 2014: High prevalence of FLT-3 ITD mutations in patients (pts) with AML who present with CNS relapse. Background: Despite CR rates of 70% with modern chemotherapeutic regimens, most pts with AML relapse. CNS relapses have become uncommon with the use of high-dose cytarabine based regimens. The features associated with a higher risk of CNS relapse are not defined. Method(s): We analyzed adults who presented with AML and CNS relapses from 2000 until 2014. CNS leukemia was diagnosed by the presence of blasts in a cytocentrifuge preparation of CSF. Pts with blasts in the CSF together with high numbers of red blood cells (> 5) were not considered to have CNS disease if the blasts were high in the PB. Result(s): Of the 1312 pts with AML treated at our institution, 71 (5%) had CNS disease. Median age was 57 years. CNS involvement was detected after a median of 8 months from the initial diagnosis. 4 pts (6%) had isolated CNS relapse that was followed by systemic relapse after a median of 2 weeks. CNS involvement was detected in the setting of refractory AML in 31 pts (44%). 64 pts (90%) received previous high-dose cytarabine. 54 pts (76%) had neurologic symptoms at time of CNS relapse. CNS imaging was performed in 67 pts (94%): 41 (61%) had abnormal findings by MRI suggestive of CNS disease. 4 pts had zero cells with blasts detected on cytocentrifuge preparation only. None of the 4 pts had circulating blasts and all had abnormal findings on brain MRI suggestive of CNS relapse. 18 pts (25%) were FLT3-ITD mutated. CNS involvement was more commonly observed in young pts with increased WBC, BM blasts, and LDH, with M4/M5 phenotype, and FLT3/ITD mutated (12% versus 5%, p=0.003). Treatment for CNS disease consisted of IT chemotherapy in all pts, whole brain radiation therapy in 14, and spinal radiation in 8. Therapy was successful in clearing all signs of CNS disease in 29 (41%). 19 of the 29 pts (65%) subsequently had additional CNS relapses after a median of 3 months. The 2-year survival rate after CNS relapse was 13%. There was no difference in overall survival among patients with or without CNS disease. Conclusion(s): CNS relapse is a rare occurrence in AML (5%) and is associated with a poor prognosis. A high prevalence of FLT3-ITD mutations was observed in these pts. FLT3 mutational status and LDH level may identify patients with AML who may benefit from CNS prophylaxis.",Excluded,0.10561402
1,"Intracavitary radioimmunotherapy to treat solid tumors. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) potentially is an attractive treatment for radiosensitive early-stage solid tumors and as an adjuvant to cytoreductive surgery. Topical administration of RIT may improve the efficacy because higher local concentrations are achieved. We reviewed the results of locally applied radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of solid tumors. Intracavitary RIT in patients with ovarian cancer and glioma showed improved targeting after local administration, as compared to the intravenous administration. In addition, various studies showed the feasibility of locally applied RIT in these patients. In studies that included patients with small-volume disease, adjuvant RIT in ovarian cancer and glioma showed to be at least as effective as standard therapy. The information about RIT for peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin is scarce, while results from preclinical data are promising. RIT may be applied for other, relatively unexplored indications. Studies on the application of radiolabeled antibodies in early urothelial cell cancer have been performed, showing that intracavitary RIT may hold a promise. Moreover, in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma or malignant pleural effusion, RIT may play a role in the palliative treatment. Intracavitary RIT limits toxicity and improves tumor targeting. RIT is more effective in patients with small-volume disease of solid cancers. RIT may have potential for palliation in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma or malignant pleural effusion. The future of RIT may, therefore, not only be in the inclusion in contemporary multimodality treatment, but also in the expansion to palliative treatment. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2008.",Excluded,0.10196619

3,"Possible role of vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 and rutin in protection against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in irradiated rats. PURPOSE: To investigate the possible role of vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 and rutin in ameliorating the biochemical changes in brain and serum induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in whole body gamma-irradiated rats.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cerebral ischemia was induced in male Wistar rats (either irradiated or non-irradiated) followed by reperfusion.RESULTS: I/R increased brain content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and depleted its glutathione (GSH) content with a compensatory elevation in cytosolic activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) enzymes. It also raised brain cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and calcium (Ca(2+)) level. Furthermore, I/R provoked an inflammatory response reflected by an increment in serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interlukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Moreover, induction of I/R in irradiated rats resulted in a further increase in brain oxidative stress and cytosolic LDH activity, disturbed brain Ca(2+) homeostasis and exaggerated the inflammatory reaction. During irradiation, administration of each of vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and rutin to irradiated rats before induction of I/R, alleviated the brain oxidative stress. Moreover, these antioxidants caused attenuation of the rise of the cytosolic activities of GPx and GR. A lowering effect of the cytosolic LDH activity and Ca(2+) level were caused by treatment with antioxidants. Each of vitamin E and rutin revealed an anti-inflammatory action of these antioxidants, while CoQ10 had no effect on serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta.CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that supplementation with either vitamin E, CoQ10 or rutin ameliorated most of the biochemical changes induced by I/R in irradiated rat brain and serum.",Included,0.9238678
4,"Investigating molecular biomarkers in SCLC. Aim: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer that relapses quickly after conventional treatment. Molecular biomarkers have been investigated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and targeted treatments in advanced disease are established. Currently there are no established targeted therapies in SCLC and the aim of this study was to examine for the presence of known molecular targets in patients with SCLC. Method(s): A panel of histopathologically proven formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens of SCLC diagnosed between 1990 and 2010 were analysed for EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF mutations, ALK gene rearrangements and MET amplification. EGFR and KRAS testing were done using real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR cobas), BRAF and NRAS using capillary electrophoresis-single strand conformation analysis (CE-SSCA) and ALK and MET using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Any positive results were repeated for confirmation. Any inconsistent results were sequenced using the direct Sanger sequencing. . Result(s): A hundred and five cases of SCLC were identified and 75 FFPE blocks retrieved. Sixty samples were suitable for molecular testing, with 25 examined for all 6 molecular targets successfully. No mutations in EGFR were detected in 31 cases suitable for analysis. KRAS and NRAS mutational analysis was successful in 35 and 37 cases respectively; all of which were wild type. Fifty-eight cases were assessed for ALK gene rearrangements and 42 cases for MET gene amplifications; no rearrangements or amplifications were detected. Forty-seven samples were successfully analysed for BRAF gene mutation, with one V600E mutation detected (2.1% of cases). This patient was a 55 years old Caucasian male smoker who was diagnosed as SCLC, limited stage. He had a history of squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed 6 months prior to the SCLC diagnosis (treated by lobectomy). He responded well to his SCLC treatment (radical chemoradiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation). He died nine months after diagnosis. Conclusion(s): EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, ALK and MET were not detected in the examined panel of SCLC patients. A BRAF mutation was identified in a single patient with a recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, suggesting a mixed pathology tumour rather than a biomarker in SCLC. This panel of biomarkers should no longer be explored in SCLC.",Excluded,0.103381634
5,"Effect of gamma-radiation of an extremely high dose on the cerebral cortex of the rat (ultrastructural aspects). [Russian]. For 24 h after total gamma-radiation of mature Wistar male rats (180-210 g) in the dose of 150 Gy, ultrastructural rearrangements of the cerebral sensomotor cortex are presented as small destructive changes in neurons, neuroglia and vascular endothelium. Total combination of the changes in ultrastructure of the blood capillaries and perivascular astrocytes makes it possible to suppose that permeability of the microvascular bed wall is increased. At this period, together with the destructive changes there are evidently certain compensatory-restorative processes, developing in the cerebral tissue. It is possible to suppose that already during the first hours after the radiation the ultrastructural changes of neurons are resulted not only from the direct effect of radiation, but from certain influences of the radiation damage of neuroglia and microvessels.",Included,0.92410976
6,"[Indices of the status of the cholinergic processes in the rat sensorimotor cortex and caudate nucleus at early periods after gamma-irradiation at a dose of 150 Gr]. An insignificant increase in the content of acetylcholine-like substances was registered in the rat brain cortex and caudate nucleus 15 min after whole-body gamma-irradiation with a dose of 150 Gy. After 24 h, the number of these substances appreciably decreased. Total acetylcholinesterase activity in the above brain parts gradually decreased throughout the entire period of observation. These indices changed more markedly in the caudate nucleus than in the cortex of the brain.",Included,0.92412716
7,"Increase of mtDNA number and its mutant copies in rat brain after exposure to 150 MeV protons. Proton beam therapy is widely used for treating brain tumor. Despite the efficacy of treatment, the use of this therapy has met some limitations associated with possible damage to normal brain tissues located beyond the tumor site. In this context, the exploration of the harmful effects of protons on the normal brain tissues is of particular interest. We have investigated changes in the total mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and identified mtDNA mutant copies in three brain regions (the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum) of rats after irradiation their whole-head with 150 MeV protons at doses of 3 and 5 Gy. The study was performed in 2-months old male Spraque Dawley rats (n = 5 each group). The mtDNA copy numbers were determined by real-time PCR. The level of mtDNA heteroplasmy was estimated using Surveyor nuclease technology. Our results show that after head exposure to protons, levels of mtDNA copy number in three rat brain regions increase significantly as the levels of mtDNA mutant copies increase. The most significant elevation is observed in the hippocampus. In conclusion, an increase in mtDNA mutant copies may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied by increased oxidative stress in different brain regions and promote the development of neurodegenerative diseases and the induction of carcinogenesis.",Included,0.9236447

9,"Functional analysis of the hippocampus using optofMRI. In recent years the technique of optogenetics has been thoroughly developed. By inducing the expression of ChR2 (light-gated cation channel) in the neuronal cells of the rat brain, we can operate the activity of neurons by using light. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals is widely used to measure brain activity. In a recent paper, optogenetics and fMRI were combined. This technique was called opto-fMRI (ofMRI) and enabled us to observe the entire brain noninvasively. Our study focused on hippocampus, due to its role in neurogenesis and memory formation. We investigated how the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus responds when it is stimulated by light. FMRI data was analyzed statistically using spm5 software. As a result, when the DG was stimulated by light, we observed significant BOLD change of the CA1 and CA3 regions. In this study, we succeeded in measuring opto-fMRI BOLD signals of the hippocampus. We also investigated how the new born cells of the adult hippocampus play the functional role in the hippocampal network, after neurogenesis were inhibited by gamma-ray irradiation.",Excluded,0.10519624
10,"A histological and ultrastructural study of the skin of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) alevins exposed to different levels of ultraviolet B radiation. The current study was conducted to evaluate the effects of UV-B radiation on survival rate and histopathological changes in the skin structure and ultrastructure in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) alevins. In laboratory dark conditions, newly hatched rainbow trout alevins were exposed to two different doses of UV-B radiation (high dose: HD: 94.83 muW cm(-2)) and (low dose: LD: 68.75 muW cm(-2)) for 9 days (time of exposure: 15 min per day), whereas specimens kept in darkness served as a control group. At the end of the experiment, alevins exposed to HD-UVB had the lowest survival rate (43.9 +/- 0.9%), whereas fish exposed to LD-UVB showed intermediate values (73.6 +/- 0.4%) with regard to the control group (91.2 +/- 0.2%). Light microscopic and scanning electron microscopic studies revealed necrosis, sunburned cells, epidermis lifting of the epidermis, reduced number of mucous cells, degeneration of mucous cells and destruction of pavement cell microridges in both UV-B exposed groups. Hemorrhage and inflation in the meningeal layer of the brain were also observed in 17% and 42% of fish exposed to LD- and HD-UVB, respectively.",Excluded,0.107635334
11,"Hydrophobicity and conformational change as mechanistic determinants for nonspecific modulators of amyloid beta self-assembly. The link between many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and the aberrant folding and aggregation of proteins has prompted a comprehensive search for small organic molecules that have the potential to inhibit such processes. Although many compounds have been reported to affect the formation of amyloid fibrils and/or other types of protein aggregates, the mechanisms by which they act are not well understood. A large number of compounds appear to act in a nonspecific way affecting several different amyloidogenic proteins. We describe here a detailed study of the mechanism of action of one representative compound, lacmoid, in the context of the inhibition of the aggregation of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) associated with Alzheimer's disease. We show that lacmoid binds Abeta(1-40) in a surfactant-like manner and counteracts the formation of all types of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) aggregates. On the basis of these and previous findings, we are able to rationalize the molecular mechanisms of action of nonspecific modulators of protein self-assembly in terms of hydrophobic attraction and the conformational preferences of the polypeptide.",Excluded,0.10194043
12,"CT perfusion in acute ischemic stroke: a comparison of 2-second and 1-second temporal resolution. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CT perfusion data sets are commonly acquired using a temporal resolution of 1 image per second. To limit radiation dose and allow for increased spatial coverage, the reduction of temporal resolution is a possible strategy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of reduced temporal resolution in CT perfusion scans with regard to color map quality, quantitative perfusion parameters, ischemic lesion extent, and clinical decision-making when using DC and MS algorithms.MATERIALS AND METHODS: CTP datasets from 50 patients with acute stroke were acquired with a TR of 1 second. Two-second TR datasets were created by removing every second image. Various perfusion parameters (CBF, CBV, MTT, TTP, TTD) and color maps were calculated by using identical data-processing settings for 2-second and 1-second TR. Color map quality, quantitative region-of-interest-based perfusion measurements, and TAR/NVT lesions (indicated by CBF/CBV mismatch) derived from the 2-second and 1-second processed data were statistically compared.RESULTS: Color map quality was similar for 2-second versus 1-second TR when using DC and was reduced when using MS. Regarding quantitative values, differences between 2-second and 1-second TR datasets were statistically significant by using both algorithms. Using DC, corresponding tissue-at-risk lesions were slightly smaller at 2-second versus 1-second TR (P < .05), whereas corresponding NVT lesions showed excellent agreement. With MS, corresponding tissue-at-risk lesions showed excellent agreement but more artifacts, whereas NVT lesions were larger (P < .001) compared with 1-second TR. Therapeutic decisions would have remained the same in all patients.CONCLUSIONS: CTP studies obtained with 2-second TR are typically still diagnostic, and the same therapy would have been provided. However, with regard to perfusion quantitation and image-quality-based confidence, our study indicates that 1-second TR is preferable to 2-second TR.",Excluded,0.10700004
13,"Side effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation biased task performance in a cognitive neuroscience study. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is increasingly used as a research tool for functional brain mapping in cognitive neuroscience. Despite being mostly tolerable, side effects of TMS could influence task performance in behavioural TMS studies. In order to test this issue, healthy subjects assessed the discomfort caused by the stimulation during a verbal working memory task. We investigated the relation between subjective disturbance and task performance. Subjects were stimulated during the delay period of a delayed-match-to-sample task above cortical areas that had been identified before to be involved in working memory. Task performance and subjective disturbance due to side effects were monitored. The subjects' grade of discomfort correlated with the error rates: the higher the discomfort, the more errors were made. Conclusively, TMS side effects may bias task performance in cognitive neuroscience studies and may thereby lead to misinterpretation of results. We emphasize the importance of controlling side effects of the stimulation as a source of biasing effects in TMS studies.",Excluded,0.10278639

16,"High levels of enhanced reactivation of herpes simplex virus in skin fibroblasts from various hereditary cancer-prone syndromes. The dose response of the enhanced reactivation (ER) of herpes simplex virus type 1 has been studied in UV-irradiated normal human skin fibroblasts and fibroblasts from the following hereditary cancer-prone syndromes: retinoblastoma, aniridia, polyposis coli, neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2, dysplastic nevus syndrome, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, and Bloom's syndrome. Surprisingly, much higher levels of ER were observed in all these genetically heterogeneous hereditary disorders than in normal human skin fibroblasts. These results suggest that loss of one allele of putative tumor suppressor genes may activate cellular processes that result in the induction of the ER response, and they support our previous observation suggesting that ER may somehow be related to the process of carcinogenesis (P. J. Abrahams et al., Cancer Res., 48: 6054-6057, 1988).",Excluded,0.11174486
17,"AMPA silencing is a prerequisite for developmental long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region. AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) unsilencing is an often proposed expression mechanism both for developmental long-term potentiation (LTP), involved in circuitry refinement during brain development, and for mature LTP, involved in learning and memory. In the hippocampal CA3-CA1 connection naive (nonstimulated) synapses are AMPA signaling and AMPA-silent synapses are created from naive AMPA-signaling (AMPA-labile) synapses by test-pulse synaptic activation (AMPA silencing). To investigate to what extent LTPs at different developmental stages are explained by AMPA unsilencing, the amount of LTP obtained at these different developmental stages was related to the amount of AMPA silencing that preceded the induction of LTP. When examined in the second postnatal week Hebbian induction was found to produce no more stable potentiation than that causing a return to the naive synaptic strength existing prior to the AMPA silencing. Moreover, in the absence of a preceding AMPA silencing Hebbian induction produced no stable potentiation above the naive synaptic strength. Thus this early, or developmental, LTP is nothing more than an unsilencing (dedepression) and stabilization of the AMPA signaling that was lost by the prior AMPA silencing. This dedepression and stabilization of AMPA signaling was mimicked by the presence of the protein kinase A activator forskolin. As the relative degree of AMPA silencing decreased with development, LTP manifested itself more and more as a ""genuine"" potentiation (as opposed to a dedepression) not explained by unsilencing and stabilization of AMPA-labile synapses. This ""genuine,"" or mature, LTP rose from close to nothing of total LTP prior to postnatal day (P)13, to about 70% of total LTP at P16, and to about 90% of total LTP at P30. Developmental LTP, by stabilization of AMPA-labile synapses, thus seems adapted to select synaptic connections to the growing synaptic network. Mature LTP, by instead strengthening existing stable connections between cells, may then create functionally tightly connected cell assemblies within this network.",Excluded,0.10536814
18,"High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue as initial therapy for anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Purpose: Anaplastic oligodendroglioma is a chemosensitive glial neoplasm. To improve disease control and postpone cranial radiotherapy, we designed a phase II study of intensive procarbazine, lomunstine and vincristine followed by high-dose thiotepa with autologous stem cell rescue for patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic or aggressive oligodendroglioma. Patients and Methods: Sixty-nine patients with a median age of 42 (range: 18-67) and a median Karnofsky Performance Score of 90 (range: 70-100) were enrolled. Sixteen patients had a prior diagnosis of low-grade oligodendroglioma and 16 had mixed oligoastrocytoma pathology. Only patients with demonstrably chemosensitive enhancing tumors or those free of enhancing tumor after surgery and induction therapy were eligible to receive high-dose thiotepa. Result(s): Thirty-nine patients (57%) completed the transplant regimen; their estimated median progression-free survival is 69 months and median overall survival has not been reached. Twelve transplanted patients (31 %) relapsed. Neither histology nor prior low-grade oligodendroglioma correlated with relapse; however, persistent non-enhancing tumor at transplant conferred an increased risk of relapse (p = 0.028). The transplant regimen was well-tolerated; median hospital stay was 20 days (range: 7-43) with a median time to ANC and platelet engraftment of 10 days. Thirty patients (43%) did not receive high-dose thiotepa because of stable or progressive disease (n = 21), excessive toxicity (n = 4), refusal of further therapy (n = 2), failure to obtain insurance coverage (n = 2), or other (n - 1). No treatment-related or long-term neurotoxicity was seen in the transplanted patients. Conclusion(s): High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue as initial treatment for anaplastic oligodendroglioma is feasible and associated with prolonged tumor control in some patients.",Excluded,0.1027991
19,"Treatment for primary CNS lymphoma: the next step. PURPOSE: The use of preradiotherapy (RT) methotrexate (MTX) has improved disease control and survival in patients with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL). The reported protocol was designed to optimize and enhance the chemotherapeutic component of treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients were treated with five cycles of high-dose MTX 3.5 g/m(2), procarbazine 100 mg/m(2)/d, and vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2). Thirty patients received whole-brain RT (45 Gy). Twenty-two older patients deferred RT to diminish the risk of delayed neurotoxicity; these patients are compared with 12 older patients who completed the entire treatment regimen. Most patients (n = 35) received high-dose cytarabine after RT.RESULTS: Objective response rate to the induction chemotherapy regimen was 90%; overall median survival is 60 months. Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was seen in 30 patients, primarily in association with cytarabine; grade 3 nephrotoxicity due to MTX was seen in two patients. Older patients had similar median survival with or without the addition of RT: 32 versus 33 months, respectively. However, late neurotoxicity was significantly more common in those older patients who received RT (P: =.00004). Patients younger than 60 years who received the complete treatment regimen have not reached median disease-free or overall survival.CONCLUSION: Increasing the dose of MTX and adding procarbazine and vincristine improved disease control and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL. Younger patients in particular fared extremely well with this treatment regimen. In older patients, deferring whole-brain RT did not compromise overall survival but did reduce treatment-related toxicity.",Excluded,0.10429785
20,"Demographics and outcome of meningioma patients treated in a tertiary care center in the middle east. INTRODUCTION: Meningioma is the most frequently diagnosed intracranial primary brain tumor. Many risk and prognostic factors have been previously reported from various centers in different parts of the world. To our knowledge, data from the Middle East region is lacking. We set to study the risk factors and outcomes of meningioma patients treated in a multidisciplinary tertiary-care center in the Middle East treating patients from the entire region. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with pathologic diagnosis of meningioma from January 2005 to December 2015 at the American Univeristy of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) were included. Baseline demographics and risk factors were retrospectively collected and reviewed. Follow up and current disease status were then collected from the patients' charts and updated by a specific questionnaire phone call interviews done by a third party. RESULT(S): Two-hundred and seven patients were analyzed. The mean overall survival (OS) and Progression free survival (PFS) for the entire cohort was 81 and 30 months respectively. Patients' area of residence (city VS country side), occupation, alcohol use, oral contraceptive use, family history of meningioma, previous head trauma, exposure to radiation head/brain imaging, cell phone use, and finally their current meningioma's Ki-67 stain were examined in univariate analysis and found not to correlate with survival outcome. On the other hand, high BMI (>25), male gender, intermediate/high grade and subtotal resection were significant predictors of worse OS. Multivariate analysis showed that subtotal resection and intermediate/high grade tumors were significant independent predictors of poor survival. CONCLUSION(S): In conclusion, our findings coincide with other results reported in the literature from other regions. Complete surgical resection and low-grade disease remain the two most important prognostic factors for patients diagnosed with meningioma.",Excluded,0.112862386
21,"Clinical outcome after fractionated radiation therapy for pituitary adenoma. Purpose/Objective(s): Pituitary tumors are relatively uncommon. Primary goals of treatment include normalization of hormonal level and improving visual or neurological symptoms. Surgery, medical treatment, irradiation, or combination of these modalities is used to achieve these goals. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the clinical outcome of pituitary adenoma treated with fractionated external beam radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of pituitary adenoma treated at our center between 2006 and 2014. A total of 88 patients with biopsy-proven adenomas were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 38 years (18-79 years) and 49 patients (56%) were males. Majority of tumors were marcoadenoma (87%). Presenting symptoms were mainly hormonal disturbance in 43 patients (49%), visual defects in 29 patients (33%) and headache in 21 patients (23%). Prolactinomas were the most common secretory adenoma in 22 patients (51%), followed by growth hormone secreting adenomas in 15 patients (35%) and ACTH-secreting tumors in 5 patients (12%), while one patient had TSH-secreting adenoma. The cohort follow up time reached 87 months (mean; 32 months). The primary endpoints are clinical and biochemical control. Result(s): Thirteen patients lost to follow up, therefore 75 patients were included in the final analysis. Surgery was the primary treatment modality in 70 patients (93%).While medical treatment was used for inoperable or hormonal secreting adenoma in 30 patients (40%). Fractionated radiation therapy was delivered to 28 patients (37%), indications for radiation were symptomatic, incompletely resected tumors (16 patients) or persistent hypersecretion (12 patients). For secretory tumors the median radiation dose was 52Gy (50-54Gy), and lower dose was delivered for non-secretory adenoma; mean 50Gy (45-52Gy). For patients received radiation therapy, the tumor control rate is 75% for non-functioning adenomas, and 69% for functioning adenomas. Conclusion(s): Pituitary adenoma is a slow growing benign tumor; however devastating effect can result from neurological deficits or hormonal imbalance. Our results reveal that functioning adenomas carry worse prognosis. Fractionated radiation therapy, as an adjunct to surgery and medical treatment, offers good clinical and biochemical control for pituitary adenoma. More aggressive multimodal approach and incorporation of new radiation technique may help to achieve better clinical outcome.",Included,0.70053035

23,"Intrathecal sICAM-1 production in multiple sclerosis Correlation with triple dose Gd-DTPA MRI enhancement and IgG index. In this study the aim was to evaluate the intrathecal sICAM-1 production in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients during relapse and remission. In addition to this, we assessed whether there is a correlation between intrathecal sICAM-1 production and other disease activity markers such as IgG index and gadolinium enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Twenty four relapsing- remitting MS patients were included in the study. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained both during relapse and remission. The soluble form of ICAM (sICAM) was measured by the ELISA method in serum and CSF. Cranial MRI with triple dose gadolinium injection was performed for each patient both during relapse and remission. Serum levels of sICAM-1 (245.23+/-92.88 ng/ml) were higher during relapse than those in remission (219.90+/-110.94 ng/ml), but the difference was not statistically significant. In relapse periods CSF levels of sICAM-1 (1.304+/-0.92 ng/ml) were higher than those in remission (1.06+/-0.86 ng/ml), but this was not significant. However, during relapse periods patients had significantly higher sICAM-1 index values (1.76+/-0.60) than those found during remission periods (1.01+/-0.44) (p<0.05). The IgG index values were higher in relapse periods than in remission (0.88+/-0.37 vs. 0.67+/-0.28) (p<0.005). On T1 weighted images following triple dose Gd injection, at least two or more enhancing lesions were present in 22/24 of the patients (91 %) in relapse and 4/24 of the patients (19 %) in remission. There was strong correlation both between the sICAM-1 index and Gd enhancement (r=0.72 p<0.05) and sICAM-1 index and IgG index in relapse (r=0.69 p<0.05). In conclusion, there is association between high sICAM-1 and IgG indices, as well as between high sICAM-1 index and Gd enhancing MRI lesions in relapsing MS patients.",Excluded,0.10473505
24,"Patch-basis electrocortical source imaging in epilepsy. In this study, we developed numerical methods for investigating the sources of epileptic activity from intracranial EEG recordings acquired from intracranial subdural electrodes (iEEG) in patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluation at the epilepsy center of the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN). The data were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA), which identifies and isolates maximally independent signal components in multi-channel recordings. A realistic individual head model was constructed for a patient undergoing pre-surgical evaluation. Structural models of gray matter, white matter, CSF, skull, and scalp were extracted from pre-surgical MR and post-surgical CT images. The electromagnetic source localization forward problem was solved using the Boundary Element Method (BEM). Source localization was performed using the Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) algorithm. The multiscale patch-basis source space constructed for this purpose includes a large number of dipole elements on the cortical layer oriented perpendicular to the local cortical surface. These source dipoles are combined into overlapping multi-scalepatches. Using this approach, we were able to detect seizure activity on sulcal walls and on gyrus of the cortex.",Excluded,0.102123685
25,"Association of 1p/19q Codeletion and Radiation Necrosis in Adult Cranial Gliomas After Proton or Photon Therapy. PURPOSE: To analyze the incidence of and risk factors for clinically significant radiation necrosis (cRN) in adult cranial oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas treated with proton or photon therapy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 2007 and 2015, 160 patients with grade 2 or 3 oligodendrogliomas (with 1p/19q codeletion, n = 53) or astrocytomas (without 1p/19q codeletion, n = 107) were treated with proton (n = 37) or photon (n = 123) therapy. Clinically significant radiation necrosis (RN) was defined as symptomatic RN or asymptomatic RN that resulted in surgery or bevacizumab administration. The cumulative incidence was calculated using competing risks. Risk factors were identified using Cox proportional hazards.RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 28.5 months, cRN developed in 18 patients (proton, 6; photon, 12). The 2-year cumulative incidence of cRN for proton and photon therapy was 18.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.5%-33.8%) and 9.7% (95% CI, 5.1%-16%), respectively (P = .16). On multivariate analysis, risk factors for cRN included oligodendroglioma (hazard ratio [HR], 3.57; 95% CI, 1.38-9.25; P = .009) and higher prescription dose (in gray relative biological equivalents [GyRBE]) (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.61; P = .015). The 2-year cumulative incidence of cRN in oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas was 24.2% and 6.2%, respectively (P = .01). The relative volume (percentage) of brain receiving 60 GyRBE was a significant dosimetric predictor of cRN in oligodendrogliomas (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.20; P = .005).CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that 1p/19q codeleted oligodendroglioma was a significant risk factor associated with cRN and the relative volume (percentage) of brain receiving 60 GyRBE was an important dosimetric predictor of cRN for oligodendroglioma patients. There is insufficient evidence at this time to conclude a significant difference in the incidence of cRN between proton and photon therapy.",Excluded,0.80656654
26,"Efficacy and safety of CyberKnife radiosurgery in elderly patients with brain metastases: a retrospective clinical evaluation. BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been increasingly applied for up to 10 brain metastases instead of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) to achieve local tumor control while reducing neurotoxicity. Furthermore, brain-metastasis incidence is rising due to the increasing survival of patients with cancer. Our aim was to analyze the efficacy and safety of CyberKnife (CK) radiosurgery for elderly patients.METHODS: We retrospectively identified all patients with brain metastases >= 65 years old treated with CK-SRS at our institution since 2011 and analyzed data of primary diseases, multimodality treatments, and local therapy effect based on imaging follow-up and treatment safety. Kaplan-Meier analysis for local progression-free interval and overall survival were performed.RESULTS: We identified 97 patients (233 lesions) fulfilling the criteria at the first CK-SRS. The mean age was 73.2 +/- 5.8 (range: 65.0-87.0) years. Overall, 13.4% of the patients were > 80 years old. The three most frequent primary cancers were lung (40.2%), kidney (22.7%), and malignant melanoma (15.5%). In 38.5% (47/122 treatments) multiple brain metastases were treated with the CK-SRS, with up to eight lesions in one session. The median planning target volume (PTV) was 1.05 (range: 0.01-19.80) cm<sup>3</sup>. A single fraction was applied in 92.3% of the lesions with a median prescription dose of 19 (range: 12-21) Gy. The estimated overall survivals at 3-, 6-, and 12 months after SRS were 79, 55, and 23%, respectively. The estimated local tumor progression-free intervals at 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, and 72 months after SRS were 99.2, 89.0, 67.2, 64.6, and 64.6%, respectively. Older age and female sex were predictive factors of local progression. The Karnofsky performance score remained stable in 97.9% of the patients; only one patient developed a neurological deficit after SRS of a cerebellar lesion (ataxia, CTCAE Grade 2).CONCLUSIONS: SRS is a safe and efficient option for the treatment of elderly patients with brain metastases with good local control rates without the side effects of WBRT. Older age and female sex seem to be predictive factors of local progression. Prospective studies are warranted to clarify the role of SRS treatment for elderly patients.",Excluded,0.113682896
27,"A 4-year retrospective review of our experience developing a successful non-vascular thoracic MR practice. Purpose: For some time, subspecialists in neurologic, musculoskeletal, GI/GU, cardiac, and breast imaging have harnessed the well-known superior tissue characterization of MRI to improve diagnosis and patient care. By contrast, many thoracic imaging specialists may be underutilizing thoracic MRI. Recognizing the potential value of thoracic MRI to patient care, we set out to increase its utilization. Material(s) and Method(s): In late 2008 we began updating our nonvascular thoracic MR protocols, incorporating a combination of body and cardiac MRtechniques, creating a more high quality, interpretable examination by consultation with MR applications specialists and cardiac MR technologists and by imaging of volunteers. We reviewed MR protocol principles with our thoracic imaging division and began to show current MR cases regularly at our weekly thoracic imaging case conference. We educated our technologists with in-service presentations and hands-onMR imaging of volunteers to familiarize them with issues and challenges particular to thoracicMRimaging.We have trained our thoracic imaging fellows to protocol, monitor, and interpret these studies and have been educating our referring physicians about MR's value in increasing diagnostic specificity, guiding surgical approach, and preventing unnecessary interventional procedures without radiation exposure. We also retrospectively reviewed thoracic MR utilization from 2009 through 2012. Result(s): Our thoracic MR volume increased from 18 cases in 2009 to 88 cases in 2012 totalling 219 examinations over this period-182 mediastinal, 28 full chest, 5 focused pleural, 2 superior sulcus, and 2 combined neck/upper chest (these numbers exclude brachial plexus MRIs interpreted by our Musculoskeletal Imaging division). Indications included further characterization of thymic, other mediastinal, and pleural lesions, follow-up of thoracic lymphadenopathy, and assessment of chest wall/vascular invasion by lung cancer and mesothelioma. Internists requested 130/219 studies (59%) and surgeons requested 89/219 (41%), with many repeat referrals indicative of a new recognition of thoracic MR's value. Conclusion(s): With continuous updating of thoracic MR protocols, ongoing education of MR technologists and physicians, and incorporation of MR training into thoracic MR fellowship programs, the full contribution of thoracic MR to clinical practice can be realized. Clinical Implication: Improving thoracic MR protocols and educating technologists and physicians promote increased thoracic MR utilization and may improve patient care.",Excluded,0.10393254
28,"From prion diseases to prion-like propagation mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative sporadic, inherited, or acquired disorders. In humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is the most studied prion disease. In animals, the most frequent prion diseases are scrapie in sheep and goat, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and the emerging chronic wasting disease in wild and captive deer in North America. The hallmark of prion diseases is the deposition in the brain of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, an abnormal beta-sheet-rich form of the cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) (Prusiner 1982). According to the prion hypothesis, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can trigger the autocatalytic conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> into PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, presumably in the presence of cofactors (lipids and small RNAs) that have been recently identified. In this review, we will come back to the original works that led to the discovery of prions and to the protein-only hypothesis proposed by Dr. Prusiner. We will then describe the recent reports on mammalian synthetic prions and recombinant prions that strongly support the protein-only hypothesis. The new concept of ""deformed templating"" regarding a new mechanism of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation and replication will be exposed. The review will end with a chapter on the prion-like propagation of other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and tauopathies. © 2013 Isabelle Acquatella Tran Van Ba et al.",Excluded,0.1033536

30,"AlphaB-crystallin (aBC) expression in breast cancer brain metastases (BM) and primary breast cancer (pBC) with eventual BM and association with outcome. Background: aBC, a small heat shock protein, is commonly expressed in basal BC and predicts poor survival in BC patients (pts). aBC has been associated with the development of BM within basal BC. We evaluated the expression of aBC in BM and pBC with eventual BM and its association with survival. Method(s): Under IRB approval (UNC/Duke), we established a clinically-annotated biobank from 78 pts: 51 BM and 38 pBC with eventual BM (11 were matched BC and BM pairs); 59 pts had complete treatment (tx) data. IHC subtype was assigned for BM and pBC: HR+ (hormone receptor)/HER2-, triple-negative (TN; ER-/PR-/HER2-), and HR+or-/HER2+. aBC expression was based on % of positively stained tumor cells: negative (0%), weak (<30%) and strong positive (30%). Overall survival (OS) and survival after BM were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank test). Result(s): Median age was 50 yrs (26-84). 67% were Caucasian, 32% African American. 90% received systemic tx for metastatic BC, of which 67% followed BM. 90% received local tx (resection and/or radiation) for BM. There was no difference in receipt of local or systemic tx by aBC. Subtype for pBC (n=36) was 31% (HR+/HER2-), 42% (TN), and 28% (HR+or-/HER2+); for BM (n=42) 33%, 43% and 24%, respectively. aBC was expressed in 37% (14/38) of pBC and 47% (24/51) of BM. Concordance of aBC expression between pBC and BM was 55% (6/11). Gain of aBC expression (4/11) was more common in BM than loss (1/11). aBC was more commonly expressed in TNBC (pBC 73%; BM 67%) compared to HR+/HER2- (pBC 9%; 29% BM) or HR+or-/HER2+ (pBC 0%; 30% BM). OS and survival after BM differed by subtype (all p<0.02); pts with TNBC experienced the poorest outcome. OS and survival after BM was inferior for all pts (n=38) and those with TNBC (n=15) whose pBC expressed aBC (Table). aBC expression within BM was not prognostic (p>0.05). Conclusion(s): aBC expression in BM and pBC with eventual BM is frequent and associated with TNBC. Among pts with BM, expression of aBC in the pBC predicts for inferior OS and survival after BM even among poor prognosis pts with TNBC BM. (Table Presented).",Excluded,0.10723576
31,"Potential role of intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the treatment of tumors of the maxillary sinus. Purpose: To assess 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques to see whether doses to critical structures could be reduced while maintaining planning target volume (PTV) coverage in patients receiving conventional radiotherapy (RT) for carcinoma of the maxillary sinus because of the risk of radiation-induced complications, particularly visual loss. Methods and Materials: Six patients who had recently received conventional RT for carcinoma of the maxillary sinus were studied. Conventional RT, 3D-CRT, and step-and-shoot IMRT plans were prepared using the same 2-field arrangement. The effect of reducing the number of segments in the IMRT beams was investigated. Result(s): 3D-CRT and IMRT reduced the brain and ipsilateral parotid gland doses compared with the conventional plans. IMRT reduced doses to both optic nerves; for the contralateral optic nerve, 15-segment IMRT plans delivered an average maximal dose of 56.4 Gy (range 53.9-59.3) compared with 65.7 Gy (range 65.3-65.9) and 64.2 Gy (range 61.4-65.6) for conventional RT and 3D-CRT, respectively. IMRT also gave improved PTV homogeneity and improved coverage, with an average of 8.5% (range 7.0-11.7%) of the volume receiving <95% of the prescription dose (64 Gy) compared with 14.7% (range 14.1-15.9%) and 15.1% (range 14.4-16.1%) with conventional RT and 3D-CRT, respectively. Little difference was found between the 15 and 7-segment plans, but 5 segments resulted in a reduced minimal PTV dose. Conclusion(s): IMRT offers significant advantages over conventional RT and 3D-CRT techniques for treatment of maxillary sinus tumors. Good results can be obtained from 7 segments per beam without compromising the PTV coverage. This number of segments is practical for implementation in a busy RT department. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded,0.105822064
32,"Time of Flight 3D Magnetic Resonance Angiography in the Follow-up of Coiled Cerebral Aneurysms. SUMMARY: The use of Guglielmi Detachable Coil (GDC) for the en do vascular treatment of intracerebral aneurysms is increasing, particularly in those aneurysms for which there is a high surgical morbidity and mortality. However, the long-term efficacy of GDC is not known. Until the natural history of GDC treatment is established longterm follow-up in this cohort of patients is required, of necessity involving repeated intraarterial angiography (IA DSA) with its known attendant risks and exposure to ionising radiation. Three dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D TOF MRA) is now readily accepted as a non-invasive screening tool for familial aneurysmal disease and has been used as an alternative to IA DSA in the surgical management of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. MRA in patients treated with GDC is safe, imparts no radiation dose and provides acceptable image quality. The aim of this study was to assess 3D TOP MRA source data, maximum intensity projection (MIP) and 3D isosurface reconstruction in comparison to IA DSA in the follow-up of 25 patients treated with GDC. Images were assessed for parent and branch artery flow, the presence of neck recurrence and aneurysm regrowth. There was good correlation for all these features when 3D isosurface MRA and source data were compared with IA DSA. The correlation between MIP MRA and IA DSA was less robust. Additional confidence can be obtained by performing plain films of the skull to demonstrate change in coil ball configuration. MRA has the potential to replace IA DSA in the follow- up of GDC treated cerebral aneurysms.",Excluded,0.10189872
33,"Variation in radiation sensitivity and repair kinetics in different parts of the spinal cord. BACKGROUND: The spinal cord, known for its strongly serial character and high sensitivity to radiation even when a small segment is irradiated, is one of the most critical organs at risk to be spared during radiation therapy. To compare the sensitivity of different parts of the spinal cord, data for radiation myelopathy have been used.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present study, the relative seriality model was fitted to two different datasets of clinical radiation myelitis concerning cervical spinal cord after treating 248 patients for head and neck cancer and thoracic spinal cord after treating 43 patients with lung carcinoma. The maximum likelihood method was applied to fit the clinical data. The model parameters and their 68% confidence intervals were calculated for each dataset. The alpha/beta ratio for the thoracic cord was also was also found to be 0.9 (0-3.0) Gy.RESULTS: The dose-response curve for the more sensitive cervical myelopathy is well described by the parameters D(50)=55.9 (54.8-57.1) Gy, gamma=6.9 (5.0-9.2), s=0.13 (0.07-0.24), whereas the thoracic myelopathy is described by the parameters D(50)=75.5 (70.5-80.8) Gy, gamma=1.1 (0.6-1.6), s=36 (3.3-infinity).DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Large differences in radiation response between the cervical and thoracic region of spinal cord are thus observed: cervical myelopathy seems to be characterized by medium seriality, while thoracic spinal cord is characterized by a highly serial dose-response. The much steeper dose-response curve for cervical spinal cord myelopathy can be interpreted as a higher number of functional subunits consistent with a higher amount of white matter close to the brain.",Excluded,0.9167013
34,"Bilateral macular detachment: Choroid as a sanctuary of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Purpose: To describe a bilateral macular detachment as the only sign of acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse and prompt reversal with total body irradiation without ocular protection. Observations: We present the case of a 20-year-old patient, diagnosed with a high-risk phy-negative, pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), with a positive MLL gene rearrangement. After a Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster-like regimen chemotherapy protocol and a first complete remission, ALL relapse was diagnosed, so he was commenced on a FlaG-Ida protocol (fludarabine, idarubicin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and high-dose cytarabine). He achieved a second complete remission with positive minimal residual disease and was scheduled for urgent allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Five days before the conditioning regimen was initiated, the patient complained of visual loss in the left eye and then in the right eye. Ophthalmological evaluation showed a best corrected visual acuity of the right eye (OD) of 20/100 and of the left eye (OS) of 20/400. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a bilateral serous sub-foveal detachment. The sub-foveal choroidal thickness was measured by enhanced depth imaging (EDI-OCT) and showed a significant increase (OD 836 mum and OS 1036 mum) compared with normal (average 310 mum). This choroidal thickness increase, associated with the serous macular detachment, was interpreted as a choroidal leukemic infiltration. A lumbar puncture with cytologic studies and flow cytometry was performed, showing no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement of leukemia. CNS and orbital magnetic nuclear resonance imaging showed no pathology. No extramedullary involvement could be confirmed. Retinal fluorescein angiography showed multiple and diffuse leakage points (pinpoint pattern) within the macular area. This pattern reinforced our presumptive diagnosis, even though the lumbar puncture and flow cytometry were negative. The hematologist decided to proceed with the bone marrow transplant. A myeloablative conditioning regimen was delivered, based on total body irradiation (TBI) with a total dose of 12 Gy plus fludarabine 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for five days. No ocular protection was used during TBI. Only 2 h after TBI commenced, the patient reported a significant improvement in his visual acuity. We confirmed 20/20 in both eyes. The OCT showed a dramatic decrease in the choroidal thickness measurement (OD 387 mum and OS 408 mum compared with 836 mum and 1036 mum measured before radiotherapy). Conclusions and importance: Complete ophthalmological evaluation and EDI-OCT choroidal thickness measurement could be fundamental tools necessary to determine CNS involvement of ALL, even in cases with negative cerebrospinal fluid and brain imaging.

35,"Cortical electrical stimulation combined with rehabilitative training: enhanced functional recovery and dendritic plasticity following focal cortical ischemia in rats. This study assessed the behavioral and dendritic structural effects of combining subdural motor cortical electrical stimulation with motor skills training following unilateral sensorimotor cortex lesions in adult male rats. Rats were pre-operatively trained on a skilled forelimb reaching task, the Montoya staircase test, and then received endothelin-1 induced ischemic lesions of the sensorimotor cortex. Ten to 14 days later, electrodes were implanted over the peri-lesion cortical surface. Rats subsequently began 10 days of rehabilitative training on the reaching task in 1 of 3 conditions: 1. 50 Hz stimulation during training, 2. 250 Hz stimulation during training or 3. no stimulation. No significant difference in performance was found between the 250 Hz and no stimulation groups. The 50 Hz stimulation group had significantly greater rates of improvement with the impaired forelimb in comparison to 250 Hz and no stimulation groups combined. Fifty Hz stimulated animals also had a significant increase in the surface density of dendritic processes immunoreactive for the cytoskeletal protein, microtubule-associated protein 2, in the peri-lesion cortex compared to the other groups. These results support the efficacy of combining rehabilitative training with cortical electrical stimulation to improve functional outcome and cortical neuronal structural plasticity following sensorimotor cortical damage.",Excluded,0.10599537
36,"Radiosurgical ablation of spinal cord AVM. Objective: Intramedullary spinal cord arteriovenous malformations (AVMs ) are very rare lesions which are characteristically associated with recurrent hemorrhage and progressive ischemia. Although favorable location, size and vascular anatomy make it sometimes possible to manage this condition with embolization and/or microsurgical resection, there are no good treatment options for many, if not most, of these lesions. Given such poor prospects, the senior author began in 1997 investigating Cy-berKnife radiosurgical ablation as a tool for managing selected patients with intramedullary spinal cord AVMs. Although a previous paper in 2006 reported the preliminary experience from Stanford, our understanding has grown significantly as follow-up was extended and more patients were treated. Herein, we retrospectively analyze our longer term experience with a primary radiosurgical approach to spinal cord AVM. Method(s): Thirty patients (17 females: 13 males) with a median age of 33 years and intramedullary spinal cord AVMs (18 cervical, 9 thoracic, and three conus medullaris) were treated with CyberKnife SRS between 1997 and 2008. A history of hemorrhage was present in 57% of cases, while in 50% of patients previous treatment included microsurgery (6/29) or embolization (11/29). The mean AVM volume was 2.8 cc (0.2-15cc) was treated to mean marginal dose of 20Gy in one to four sessions (median 2). Based on our growing experience, the biologically effective dose (BED) of radiation was escalated gradually over the course of this study. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging follow-up were carried out annually, and spinal angiography was repeated at 3 years. Result(s): After a mean follow-up period of 63 months (median 54), the treated AVM was completely obliterated in 8 cases (27%) and significantly decreased in size in an additional 11 cases (64%) among the 22 angiographically studied patients with more than 3 years of follow-up. Pre-radiosurgery neurologic symptoms improved in more than 50% of cases, but worsened in three (10%). There was one instance (3%) of radiation-induced myelopathy occurring within one year of radiosurgery. Notably, after 158 years of collective post SRS follow-up, no patient suffered a hemorrhage. Conclusion(s): Although our understanding is still incomplete, CyberKnife radiosurgery Results in total obliteration or shrinkage for most intramedullary spinal cord AVM, a phenomenon that may beaccompanied by a marked decrease in the risk of bleeding. Symptom improvement is also common in most cases. More experience is required to determine the optimal radiosurgical dosing and consequent related efficacy. Given the significant therapeutic challenges inherent to spinal cord AVM patients, the rate of radiosurgical complications appears acceptable.",Excluded,0.2598509
37,"Morphologic MRI features, diffusion tensor imaging and radiation dosimetric analysis to differentiate pseudo-progression from early tumor progression. Pseudo-progression (PsP) refers to the paradoxical increase of contrast enhancement within 12 weeks of chemo-radiation therapy in gliomas attributable to treatment effects rather than early tumor progression (ETP). This study was performed to evaluate the utility of morphologic imaging features, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and radiation dosimetric analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in differentiating PsP from ETP. Serial MRI examinations of 163 patients treated for high-grade glioma were reviewed. 46 patients showed a recurrent or progressive enhancing lesion within 12 weeks of radiotherapy. We used an in-house modified scoring system based on 20 different morphologic features (modified VASARI features) to assess the MRI studies. DTI analyses were performed in 24 patients. MRI changes were defined as recurrent volume (Vrec) and registered with pretreatment computed tomography dataset, and the actual dose received by the Vrec during treatment was calculated using dose-volume histograms. Bidimensional product of T2-FLAIR signal abnormality and enhancing component was larger in the ETP group. DTI metrics revealed no significant difference between the two groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the location of Vrec between PsP and ETP groups. Morphologic MRI features and DTI have a limited role in differentiating between PsP and ETP. The larger sizes of the T2-FLAIR signal abnormality and the enhancing component of the lesion favor ETP.

The main objective of this study was to determine whether antioxidative potential of the tissues plays a role in the aging process. Antioxidative potential was ascertained as the susceptibility of tissues to undergo protein oxidation, manifested as protein carbonyls, in response to acute oxidative stress, induced by exposure to x-rays. Brain homogenates from 22-month-old rats were more susceptible to oxidative stress than those from three-month- old rats. Brain was more susceptible to oxidative damage than the heart.

Objective: Abnormal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures of the superior cerebellar peduncles were reported in patients with Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS). A few studies showed that PSP-RS patients had DTI alterations also in the corpus callosum, internal capsulae, and long-range white matter (WM) tracts. However, most of the previous studies did not include the atypical clinical presentations of PSP. The aims of this study were to investigate the regional distribution of WM damage in patients with PSP-RS and progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism (PSP-P) using DTI, and quantify the DTI classificatory ability in diagnosing PSP syndromes, when used in combination with infratentorial volumetry. Method(s): In 37 PSP (21 PSP-RS, 16 PSP-P) and 42 controls, tractbased spatial statistics was applied. DTI metrics were derived from supratentorial, thalamic, and infratentorial tracts. Brain atrophy was investigated using voxel-based morphometry. The MR parkinsonism index (MRPI), a combined conventional MRI measurement taking into account the midbrain and pons areas and the SCP and middle cerebellar peduncle widths, was calculated. Result(s): In PSP, grey matter (GM) atrophy involved fronto-temporal lobes and basal ganglia, and was greater in PSP-RS than PSP-P. PSP-RS had a more severe and distributed WM loss, including the midbrain, SCP, and prefrontal and motor/premotor regions. All PSP harboured diffusivity abnormalities in the corpus callosum, frontoparietal and fronto-temporo-occipital tracts. Infratentorial WM and thalamic radiations were severely affected in PSP-RS and relatively spared in PSP-P.

Understanding the effects of radiation and its possible influence on the nervous system are of great clinical interest.However, there have been few electrophysiological studies on brain activity after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR).A new methodological approach regarding the assessment of the possible effects of IR on brain activity is the use of linear and nonlinear mathematical methods in the analysis of complex time series, such as brain oscillations measured using the electrocorticogram (ECoG).The objective of this study was to use linear and nonlinear mathematical methods as biomarkers of gamma radiation regarding cortical electrical activity.Adult Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups: 1 control and 2 irradiated groups, evaluated at 24 h (IR24) and 90 days (IR90) after exposure to 18 Gy of gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 radiotherapy source.The ECoG was analyzed using power spectrum methods for the calculation of the power of delta, theta, alpha and beta rhythms and by means of the alpha-exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA).Using both mathematical methods it was possible to identify changes in the ECoG, and to identify significant changes in the pattern of the recording at 24 h after irradiation.Some of these changes were persistent at 90 days after exposure to IR.In particular, the theta wave using the two methods showed higher sensitivity than other waves, suggesting that it is a possible biomarker of exposure to IR.

Since the first description of this type of carcinoma in 1972, 52 patients have been reported in the literature and a variety of treatment regimens have been used. The purpose of this study was to report two new cases and review all previous reports to determine the disease's biological behavior, clinical manifestations, and optimum treatment. Thirty-five percent of the tumors were transglottic, and 27% were supraglottic. Fifty-four percent of patients had regional metastases at initial presentation and 17.6% had distant metastases. The median survival was 10 months for all patients. Patients who were treated with chemotherapy with or without other modalities had the best 2-year survival rates (52.2%). Forty-one percent of patients had regional recurrence only, 12.5% had regional recurrence and distant metastases, and 2% developed distant metastases only. We conclude that patients with oat cell carcinoma of the larynx should be treated with combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

45,"Reduced pineal melatonin biosynthesis in fractionally irradiated rats. The effects of ionizing radiation on pineal melatonin and on key enzymes of its metabolism have been studied in our laboratory. After adaptation to an artificial light/dark cycle of 12:12 h, male Wistar rats were fractionally whole-body irradiated with a dose of 2.4 Gy of gamma-rays twice a week up to total doses of 4.8, 9.6 or 14.4 Gy. Irradiation and sham-irradiation were performed in the late afternoon. The rats were sacrificed at 24:00 to 01:00 h in darkness, 6 h, 3 or 5 days after the last exposure. Pineal and serum melatonin concentrations, pineal activities of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) and of monoamine oxidase (MAO) were determined. The NAT activities in the rats irradiated with 4.8 and 9.6 Gy decreased at some intervals without changes of melatonin concentration. Irradiation with a total dose of 14.4 Gy decreased NAT activity and the concentration of pineal and serum melatonin 6 h and 3 days after the last exposure. The activity of MAO, estimated only in the rats irradiated with the dose of 14.4 Gy, increased significantly 3 days after irradiation. The fractionated irradiation up to the dose of 14.4 Gy caused a transient decrease in pineal melatonin synthesis. This could be the consequence of preferential oxidative deamination of serotonin in comparison with its N-acetylation, leading to melatonin biosynthesis.",Included,0.92411745
46,"Phase II trial of temozolomide and TRC 102, base excision repair inhibitor, in bevacizumab naive glioblastoma at first recurrence. BACKGROUND: Temozolomide forms O6-methylguanine (O6mG), 7-methylguanine (N7mG), and 3- methyladenine (N3mA) DNA adducts. The O6mG DNA adduct is repaired by MGMT. N7mG and N3mA DNA adducts are removed by the base excision repair (BER) pathway. TRC-102 is a BER inhibitor that binds to the apurinic site created through the action of the glycosylase. METHOD(S): A phase II study of adult patients with bevacizumab- naive first recurrence of glioblastoma after radiation and temozolomide was performed in the Adult Brain Tumor Consortium. Temozolomide was administered at 150 mg/ m2 and oral TRC-102 at 150 mg daily, days 1-5 every 4 weeks. Primary objective was efficacy measured by objective radiographic response rate (RR= CR+PR). Secondary objectives included safety and PFS-6. Exploratory objectives were to assess treatment efficacy with tumor expression of N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG), a BER protein, and MGMT status with RR, PFS, and OS. The study was designed to test the hypothesis that combination therapy would achieve a RR of 30%. RESULT(S): Nineteen patients were enrolled in the first stage. Median age was 60 years (range: 48-76), 53% females, median KPS was 80 (range: 70-90). Median cycles of treatment was 2 (range: 1-12). No responses were observed. Median OS was 11.0 months (95% CI: 8-18 months), median PFS was 2.0 months (95%CI: 1.8-3.6 months). PFS-6 rate was 10.5 % (2/19). The combination was safe; two grade 3-4 toxicities included lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia. MGMT promoter was unmethylated in all patients. MPG staining was negative in six, 1+ in five and 2+ in three patients. PFS of 11 + months in two patients was associated with MPG expression.

There is limited data on specific prognostic factors for patients. with low-grade gliomas. METHOD(S): After obtaining IRB approval, the Cleveland Clinic Brain Tumor and Neuro-Oncology Center's database was used to identify patients with histologically confirmed grade 2 glioma at the time of diagnosis. Multivariable analysis was conducted with use of a Cox proportional hazards model and a stepwise selection algorithm that used p < 0.10 as the criteria for entry and p < 0.05 as retention in the model to identify independent predictors of survival. RESULT(S): Chart records of 478patients (54% of whom were men) diagnosed between 1991 and 2010 were included for analysis. The median age at presentation was 41 years (range, 18-83 years).42% of patients had biopsy only, 27% had gross total resection, 6% had near. total resection, and 25% had subtotal resection. 22% of patients were initially treated with radiation, 30% with adjuvant chemotherapy, and 7% with concurrent chemotherapy. Median progression free survival and median overall survival (OS) were 5.1 years and 12.8 years, respectively. On multivariate analysis, independent of additional therapy, five factors were identified as independent predictors of OS: age at diagnosis (p = 0.002), Karnofsky performance status (KPS, p < 0.0001), histology (astrocytoma vs. other, p = 0.001), hemispheric location (left or bilateral involvement vs. right, p = 0.02) and gender (male vs. female, p = 0.0003).

48,"Incidence of intracranial radiation necrosis following postoperative radiation therapy for sinonasal malignancies. OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Surgery and postoperative radiation therapy are commonly used in the treatment of advanced sinonasal cancer. However, post-treatment radiation changes to the brain often mimic radiologic findings suggestive of tumor recurrence, leading to potential unnecessary intracranial biopsies. The objective of this study was to determine clinical factors that predict signs of tumor recurrence versus radiation necrosis in post-therapy sinonasal malignancies with intracranial extension.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.METHODS: Twenty-six patients with sinonasal malignancy with intracranial extension underwent surgery and radiation +/- chemotherapy between 2010 and 2014 at the University of Arizona. We analyzed sinonasal cancer type, stage, total radiation dosimetry, time until imaging changes, surgical pathology, associated imaging, and patient demographics.RESULTS: Thirteen of 26 patients had postoperative imaging changes seen on surveillance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Five were deemed to have tumor recurrence due to new metastasis seen on positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan. Four patients were observed with serial imaging that confirmed pseudoprogression. In four patients, there was sufficient concern due to persistent MRI changes, which prompted surgical biopsy, and only one of them was positive for tumor recurrence. Factors that favored tumor recurrence included faster onset of imaging changes on MRI (55 vs. 186 days, P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial tumor recurrence can be difficult to distinguish between radiation necrosis in sinonasal cancers treated with surgery and postoperative radiation +/- chemotherapy. Patients with sub-total resection and rapid onset of MRI changes in postsurveillance scans are more likely to have tumor recurrence versus radiation necrosis. Future imaging techniques or tests that investigate tumor biomarkers are necessary to prevent unnecessary biopsies.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 126:2445-2450, 2016.",Excluded,0.19847985
49,"Tumor cell subpopulation changes during intracranial glioblastoma patient derived xenograft recurrence following radiation, temozolomide, or combination therapy. We've established a model for recurrent GBM by treating mice bearing previously untreated, luciferase-modified, intracranial GBM PDX, with radiation (RT) (2 Gy/day, M-F), temozolomide (TMZ) only (10 mg/kg/day, M-F), or concurrent RT/TMZ. PDX respond to treatment by showing a reduced rate of increase in tumor bioluminescence (RT only), or decreased tumor bioluminescence (TMZ only or RT/TMZ), but with eventual tumor growth requiring animal euthanasia at 5.5 (RT only), 26.5 (TMZ only), or 38 (RT/TMZ) days beyond the median survival of untreated control animal subjects. All survival extensions are significant relative to untreated control mice (p<0.05). To examine the effects of treatment on tumor cell subpopulations in intracranial PDX, we employed flow cytometric analyses of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) positive GBM cells, using a panel of markers (CD133, CD15, ABCG2, SOX2, EZH2, HIF1A, MGMT, and H3K27me3). RT alone did not cause a significant enrichment for any specific subpopulation, as identified using the markers indicated above. In contrast, PDX exposed to TMZ monotherapy or RT/TMZ combination therapy showed enrichment for CD133+HIF1A+ cells (p<0.005). PDX treated with RT/TMZ were also enriched for CD133+CD15+, and additionally showed enrichment for CD133+SOX2+ and CD133+EZH2+ cells (p<0.005 for each). Perhaps not so surprisingly, recurrent tumors that had been treated with TMZ or RT/ TMZ showed increased cellular positivity for MGMT (Control 0.78% vs. TMZ 3.4% p<0.005 and RT/TMZ 4.3% p<0.0005), though, paradoxically, these tumors also showed increased cellular positivity for EZH2 (Control 0.38% vs. TMZ 3.0% p=ns and RT/TMZ 7.8% p<0.0005) and a product of EZH2 activity, H3K27me3 (Control 0.55% vs. TMZ 18.2% p<0.0005 and RT/TMZ 4.3% p=ns), which is associated with transcriptional suppression. Corresponding immunohistochemical analysis is ongoing, with results to be presented at the meeting. In total, our data indicate that, in recurrent tumors, cell subpopulation selection/enrichment depends on the type of therapy administered, which should, in turn, influence the selection of salvage therapy for treating recurrent GBM.",Excluded,0.920497
50,"Clinical outcomes of melanoma brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiation and anti-PD-1 therapy. BACKGROUND: The anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) therapy nivolumab has significant clinical activity in patients with metastatic melanoma. However, little is known about the safety and outcomes in patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy and stereotactic radiation for the treatment of brain metastases (BMs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were analyzed retrospectively from two prospective nivolumab protocols enrolling 160 patients with advanced resected and unresectable melanoma at a single institution. Patients were included if BMs were diagnosed and treated with stereotactic radiation within 6 months of receiving nivolumab. The primary end point of this study was neurotoxicity; secondary end points included BM control and survival.RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with a total of 73 BMs treated over 30 sessions were identified. Radiation was administered before, during and after nivolumab in 33 lesions (45%), 5 lesions (7%), and 35 lesions (48%), respectively. All BMs were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in a single session except 12 BMs treated with fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy, nine of which were in the postoperative setting. One patient experienced grade 2 headaches following SRS with symptomatic relief with steroid treatment. No other treatment-related neurologic toxicities or scalp reactions were reported. Eight (11%) local BM failures with a >=20% increase in volume were noted. Of these lesions, hemorrhage was noted in 4, and edema was noted in 7. Kaplan-Meier estimates for local BM control following radiation at 6 and 12 months were 91% and 85%, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) from the date of stereotactic radiation and nivolumab initiation was 11.8 and 12.0 months, respectively, in patients receiving nivolumab for unresected disease (median OS was not reached in patients treated in the resected setting).CONCLUSIONS: In our series, stereotactic radiation to melanoma BMs is well tolerated in patients who received nivolumab. BM control and OS appear prolonged compared with standard current treatment. Prospective evaluation is warranted.",Excluded,0.22697504
51,"Spine stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of sarcoma metastasis. Purpose/Objective(s): The role of conventional radiation in the management of sarcoma metastasis to the spine is limited due to its radioresistant nature. However, spinal stereotactic radiosurgery (sSRS) may have a radiobiological advantage given the high dose per fraction. The purpose of this study is to report our experience using sSRS to treat patients with sarcoma metastasis to the spine. Materials/Methods: Thirty-four lesions (17 patients) with sarcoma metastatic to the spine were identified from a large IRB-approved database. Pain relief post-sSRS was prospectively collected using the Brief Pain Inventory. Survival was calculated from date of procedure using Kaplan- Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to determine the association between clinical factors and pain relief. Result(s): Eligible patients had a median age of 55 years and 56% were female. Median KPS was 85 (range, 60-100) and median clinical follow-up was 7 months (range, 0-58). Location of metastasis included 44% cervical/ thoracic, 35% lumbar, and 21% sacral lesions. Approximately, 12% had cord compression, 32% had epidural compression, and 59% had neural foramen involvement at the time of treatment. Reason for treatment included 53% for pain, 21% for pain and neurological deficits, 1 patient had vertebral compression fracture and the remaining 24% were asymptomatic. Target volume was a median of 71 cc (range, 16-428 cc). Median maximum prescription dose was 16 Gy (range, 14-16 Gy). In terms of prior treatment, 21% of patients had received prior cEBRT, 15% had prior SBRT, 29% had prior surgery, and 21% had received prior hardware. At 6 and 12 months, actuarial survival was 81% and 73%, radiographic control was 66% and 50%, and unadjusted pain control was 65% and 65%, respectively. Univariate analysis demonstrated that both radiographic failure and pain relief were associated with age, with older patients less likely to have radiographic failure (HR = 0.864, p = 0.0004) and pain relief (HR = 0.929, p = 0.0202). Unadjusted symptom failure was associated with a larger target volume (HR = 1.010, p = 0.0142), prior surgery (HR = 7.353, p = 0.0131), and prior hardware (HR = 4.717, p = 0.0244). Conclusion(s): We report an unadjusted pain control in 65% of sarcoma patients with spinal metastasis. Based on our previously published data and due to the comparatively lower radiographic and pain control rates when compared to other histologies, we recommend increasing the dose beyond 16 Gy for sarcomas.",Excluded,0.10867115
52,"Thrombus imaging in acute ischaemic stroke using thin-slice unenhanced CT: comparison of conventional sequential CT and helical CT. OBJECTIVES: Thin-slice helical unenhanced CT can be used for thrombus imaging but increases radiation exposure. Conventional sequential images obtained by multidetector CT can be reconstructed into thin-slice images. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if conventional sequential unenhanced CT images can replace helical unenhanced CT for thrombus imaging.METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients with acute ischaemic stroke underwent both 5-mm conventional sequential unenhanced CT and helical unenhanced CT. Each of the sequential and helical unenhanced CT images was subsequently reconstructed into four 1.25-mm images. Thrombus volumes and HU were measured semi-automatically using both types of unenhanced CT. Thrombus HU ratio (rHU) was calculated using the HU of the contralateral segment. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess measurement agreement.RESULTS: The mean rHUs were 1.47 +/- 0.17 for sequential unenhanced CT and 1.47 +/- 0.18 helical unenhanced CT (P = 0.542). The mean thrombus volumes were 124.25 +/- 125.65 mm(3) and 117.84 +/- 124.32 mm(3) on sequential and helical unenhanced CT images, respectively (P = 0.063). Measurement agreement between thrombus volumes from the two unenhanced CT images was high (ICC = 0.981).CONCLUSIONS: Thin-slice unenhanced CT images reconstructed from 5-mm sequential images can replace helical unenhanced CT for thrombus imaging in acute ischaemic stroke.KEY POINTS : * Unenhanced CT is used to evaluate intra-arterial thrombus. * Thrombus HU and volume measurements using sequential or helical CT are comparable. * Conventional sequential images can replace helical CT for thrombus imaging. * Radiation dose for thrombus imaging can be reduced using sequential CT.",Excluded,0.10388876

In the study of complex mammalian behaviours, technological limitations have prevented spatiotemporally precise control over intracellular signalling processes. Here we report the development of a versatile family of genetically encoded optical tools ('optoXRs') that leverage common structure-function relationships among G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to recruit and control, with high spatiotemporal precision, receptor-initiated biochemical signalling pathways. In particular, we have developed and characterized two optoXRs that selectively recruit distinct, targeted signalling pathways in response to light. The two optoXRs exerted opposing effects on spike firing in nucleus accumbens in vivo, and precisely timed optoXR photostimulation in nucleus accumbens by itself sufficed to drive conditioned place preference in freely moving mice. The optoXR approach allows testing of hypotheses regarding the causal impact of biochemical signalling in behaving mammals, in a targetable and temporally precise manner.",Excluded,0.103141874
58,"The natural history and radiation treatment of growing acoustic neuromas. Introduction: It is well known that a significant proportion of newly diagnosed acoustic neuromas (ANs) do not seem to change much on scans. There are less data on what happens to ANs that have initially been shown to grow on scans if left untreated. Radiation treatments can arrest growth of newly diagnosed ANs, but again, data are sparse that look specifically at the subset of ANs that have shown documented growth before radiation treatments. We reviewed our local experience with growing ANs, both what happens if left untreated and the control rate with radiation treatments. Result(s): Of those ANs that have been documented to have grown, 65% continued to grow, 30% stopped growing, and 5% decreased in size. After a mean follow-up of 60 months, 17% of the growing ANs treated with radiation continued to grow, 24% remained stable, and 59% reduced in size. Conclusion(s): There appears to be a subset of ANs that, despite showing initial growth, can stabilize in follow-up, and that radiation treatment does work but much less effectively when only those tumors that have documented prior growth are reviewed. There may be some support for the idea that radiation may be taking credit for what, in part, is the natural history of these tumors.",Excluded,0.24526155

Grade 1-2 mucositis or esophagitis, anemia, pneumonitis were significantly higher in PP group than other groups. However, hematologic toxicities were higher in the EP group than other groups.CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the weekly chemotherapy regimens with the standard dose, our study demonstrated similar PFS, but a prolonged OS with the EP regimen. The clinical response rate of weekly regimens was better than the full-dose regimen. Adverse events and toxicity rates were different and depended on the type of chemotherapy regimen used.",Excluded,0.10421631

The comparative study of effects of low doses of radiation on peripheral blood lymphocytes of persons occupationally exposed to radiation and non-exposed ones was carried out. The main attention was paid to radio-adaptive response forming under consistent exposure to low (0.05 Gy) and damaging (2 Gy) doses of gamma-irradiation. Noticeable heterogeneity in capacity for adaptive response forming in occupational group was revealed. The mathematical model adequate to experimental material was constructed using Kohonen neuronets.,Excluded,0.92412657
63,"Effect of short-duration spaceflight on thigh and leg muscle volume. PURPOSE: Human skeletal muscle probably atrophies as a result of spaceflight, but few studies have examined this issue. Thus, little is known about the influence of microgravity upon human skeletal muscle, nor is it possible to assess the validity of ground based models of spaceflight. This study tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of spaceflight induced muscle atrophy would be a function of flight duration and greater than that of bed rest.METHODS: Three astronauts flew 9, 15, and 16 d in space. Volume of the knee extensor (quadriceps femoris), knee flexor (hamstrings, sartorius, and gracilis), and plantar flexor (triceps surae) muscle groups was measured using magnetic resonance imaging before and after spaceflight and during recovery. The volume of each muscle group in each image was determined by multiplying cross-sectional area by slice thickness. These values were subsequently summed to calculate muscle volume.RESULTS: Volume changes in the knee extensor, knee flexor, and plantar flexor muscle groups ranged from -15.4 to -5.5, -14.1 to -5.6, and -8.8 to -15.9%, respectively. Muscle volume decreases normalized by flight duration ranged from 0.62 to 1.04% x d(-1). These relative changes appeared to be greater than those that we have reported previously for bed rest (Akima et al., J. Gravitat. Physiol. 4:15-22, 1997).CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that atrophy as a result of at least 2 wk of spaceflight varied among individuals and muscle groups and that the degree of atrophy appeared to be greater than that induced by 20 d of bed rest.",Excluded,0.6348299
64,"Gamma knife radiosurgery for pituitary spindle cell oncocytomas. OBJECTIVES: Spindle cell oncocytomas (SCOs) are benign lesions of the posterior portion of the pituitary gland that typically come to neurosurgical attention due to compression of the sellar or parasellar structures, and headaches. Initial treatment options for SCOs include surgical resection, particularly via the transsphenoidal approach. However, given that initial resection tends to be insufficient and subsequent revision surgery carries high complication risk, adjuvant treatment modalities may appear to offer promising solutions for controlling tumor progression. This report focuses on a potential new therapeutic option for SCOs, gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS).PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors identified all patients at one center who had a pituitary lesion treated with GKRS between 2005 and 2016. Five patients with histopathologically confirmed SCO who underwent GKRS were retrospectively identified and included in the present study RESULTS: The mean patient age was 52 years (range, 41-61 years). The most common presenting symptom was visual disturbance. All five patients had a history of transsphenoidal surgical resection prior to GKRS therapy. The mean tumor volume was 2.25 cm<sup>3</sup> (range 0.7-5.38 cm<sup>3</sup>). The median tumor margin dose was 12 Gy (range, 12-14 Gy), and the median maximal dose was 24 Gy (range, 24-35 Gy). The median isodose was 50 (range, 40-50). No tumor volume progression was observed during radiological follow-up after GKRS (mean, 52 months; range, 36-84 months). At last follow-up, no neurological, endocrinological, or visual complications had been observed.CONCLUSION: Given their highly vascular and adherent nature, SCOs can be challenging tumors to treat, in particular when they recur. In our five cases, GKRS provided excellent tumor volume control for approximately 4.3 years on average. These results suggest that GKRS is a safe and effective treatment modality for histopathologically confirmed residual SCO.",Excluded,0.109854855
65,"Models of bystander signalling between primary astrocytes and glioma cells: Effects on survival and migration/invasion. INTRODUCTION: The goal of radiotherapy is to cause cell death in the targeted tumour field and minimize toxicity to the surrounding normal tissue. However, malignant gliomas are highly resistant to ionizing radiation (IR). Recent data suggest migration/invasion is up-regulated as a counterproductive effect of IR. In addition to direct IR effects, non-targeted radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBE), observed beyond the targeted field, can cause significant cell death of the tumour and surrounding normal tissues. Little is known of how RIBE modulates glioma migration/invasion. METHOD(S): RIBE of 10 astrocytes and glioma cells grown as single and cocultures in 2D (monolayer) and 3D matrices was investigated, using media transferred from irradiated cultures and in half-exposed/shielded cultures. Nuclear 53BP1 foci were used as a surrogateDNA damage marker and transwell assays to quantitate migration/invasion. Two3D models were developed to study gliospheres in: (i) collagen matrices with/without astrocytes and (ii) mouse brain slice cultures. RESULT(S): RIBE signals from IR and non-IR glioma cultures both decreased astrocyte clonogenic survival.Weobserved increased DNA damage in astrocyte and glioma bystander cells in 2D and 3D cultures. Bystander cells had increased p38-MAPK, Connexin 43, and COX-2signalling. Direct IR induced an increase and RIBE a decrease in transwell migration. Experiments of gliosphere migration/invasion in 3D models are underway. CONCLUSION(S): These results may have implications for tumour-normal tissue margin interactions. By comparing differential molecular factors involved in the RIBE, we aim to find targets to enhance glioma cell death and inhibit migration/invasion, while preserving normal tissue.",Excluded,0.920713
66,"Analysis of forces in conventional and ultrasonically assisted plane cutting of cortical bone. Bone cutting is a well accepted but technically demanding surgical procedure in orthopaedics. A level of tool penetration force during cutting of bones has been the prime concern to surgeons, since it can produce unnecessary mechanical damage to surrounding tissues. Research in this area has been undertaken for many decades to find ways to minimise the cutting force. Cutting of bone with ultrasonic tools is a relatively new technique replacing conventional procedures in neuro-, dental and orthopaedic surgeries, due to its precision and safety. In this article, the level of forces produced during a chisel-like tool penetration in a fresh cortical bone is studied. The obtained force data are analysed for both conventional cutting and ultrasonically assisted cutting. Through a series of experiments, it was demonstrated that the depth of cut and parameters of ultrasonic oscillations affected the level of cutting force, the former being the main factor in both types of cutting. It was found that the tool penetration force was decreased with an increase in the ultrasonic frequency or amplitude and was not affected by the cutting speed. The rise in bone temperature was measured and was found to be insensitive to the level of cutting speed within the range used in this study.",Excluded,0.10191285
67,"Fine-tuning of intrinsic N-Oct-3 POU domain allostery by regulatory DNA targets. The 'POU' (acronym of Pit-1, Oct-1, Unc-86) family of transcription factors share a common DNA-binding domain of approximately 160 residues, comprising so-called 'POUs' and 'POUh' sub-domains connected by a flexible linker. The importance of POU proteins as developmental regulators and tumor-promoting agents is due to linker flexibility, which allows them to adapt to a considerable variety of DNA targets. However, because of this flexibility, it has not been possible to determine the Oct-1/Pit-1 linker structure in crystallographic POU/DNA complexes. We have previously shown that the neuronal POU protein N-Oct-3 linker contains a structured region. Here, we have used a combination of hydrodynamic methods, DNA footprinting experiments, molecular modeling and small angle X-ray scattering to (i) structurally interpret the N-Oct-3-binding site within the HLA DRalpha gene promoter and deduce from this a novel POU domain allosteric conformation and (ii) analyze the molecular mechanisms involved in conformational transitions. We conclude that there might exist a continuum running from free to 'pre-bound' N-Oct-3 POU conformations and that regulatory DNA regions likely select pre-existing conformers, in addition to molding the appropriate DBD structure. Finally, we suggest that a specific pair of glycine residues in the linker might act as a major conformational switch. © 2007 The Author(s).",Excluded,0.10224458

69,"Electroretinographic Assessment of Inner Retinal Signaling in the Isolated and Superfused Murine Retina. PURPOSE: Longer-lasting electroretinographic recordings of the isolated murine retina were initially achieved by modification of a phosphate-buffered nutrient solution originally developed for the bovine retina. During experiments with a more sensitive mouse retina, apparent model-specific limitations were addressed and improvements were analyzed for their contribution to an optimized full electroretinogram (ERG).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retinas were isolated from dark-adapted mice, transferred to a recording chamber and superfused with different solutions. Scotopic and photopic ERGs were recorded with white flashes every 3 minutes. The phosphate buffer (Sickel-medium) originally used was replaced by a carbonate-based system (Ames-medium), the pH of which was adjusted to 7.7-7.8. Moreover, addition of 0.1 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub> was investigated to reduce b-wave contamination by the slow PIII component typically present in the murine ERG.RESULTS: B-wave amplitudes were increased by the pH-shift (pH 7.4 to pH 7.7) from 22.9 +/- 1.9 microV to 37.5 +/- 2.5 microV. Improved b-wave responses were also achieved by adding small amounts of Ba<sup>2+</sup> (100 microM), which selectively suppressed slow PIII components, thereby unmasking more of the true b-wave amplitude (100.0% with vs. 22.2 +/- 10.7% without Ba<sup>2+</sup>). Ames medium lacking amino acids and vitamins was unable to maintain retinal signaling, as evident in a reversible decrease of the b-wave to 31.8 +/- 3.9% of its amplitude in complete Ames medium.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide optimized conditions for ex vivo ERGs from the murine retina and suggest that careful application of Ba<sup>2+</sup> supports reliable isolation of b-wave responses in mice.

70,"Continuous intrathecal bupivacaine and opioid infusion for the treatment of chronic stage IV liposarcoma cancer pain and diffuse spinal metastasis. Introduction We present a 58yo male with stage IV liposarcoma and diffuse cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine metastasis. Patient described severe cancer bone pain, especially troublesome in the low back. His cancer was diagnosed in 2014 and the tumor was initially resected from the posterior thigh. Bone metastasis was later noted in 2015, and later that year he developed a pathological fracture of the femur which left him bedridden. While hospitalized he developed a DVT and PE. He was started on chemotherapy and radiation, which continued to weaken and exacerbate his back pain. In addition, he suffered from right sided blindness and deafness, metastasis to the lung, HTN and depression which continued to decrease his quality of life. Results/Case report In the context of the patient's diffuse metastasis, we considered his pain secondary to metastatic cancer to the spine. The patient described the majority of the pain to be located in the low levels of his back, and characterized the pain as achy, throbbing, without radiation and exacerbated with exertion. Prior to any interventional therapy, the patient underwent conservative management with oral, intravenous, and topical agents all which did not provide any pain relief. At this point, we discussed the benefits of placement of a neuroaxial catheter, and the patient was amendable. Our preference was placement of a tunneled epidural catheter for outpatient infusion, but we were unsuccessful in securing a long-term care facility to accept care for the epidural and its dressing changes. This would have been a more cost effective option, and one that would not require invasive surgery. Since this was not possible, we discussed the possibility of intrathecal pump placement, and this was successfully implanted as a culmination of past therapies. After pump implantation, the patient was started on intrathecal morphine at 2mg/day which did not provide sufficient pain control. The morphine dose was increased to 3mg/day, plus an assist device of 0.2mg Q4hrs. Even at 4.2mg/day intrathecal morphine, equivalent to 420mg of IV morphine and >1200mg PO morphine, opioids alone were still not providing adequate pain relief. At this point, we considered the option of adding intrathecal Bupivacaine to the infusion. The patient was already bedridden and lower extremity motor weakness was not a significant factor. We slowly titrated the Bupivacaine infusion to effect. It was not until we reached 6mg/day of 2% continuous intrathecal Bupivacaine, in addition to 0.6mg Q4hrs assist device (which brought the cumulative dose to 9.4mg/day intrathecal Bupivacaine) that the patient began to experience pain relief. Discussion Intrathecal pump is a reliable therapy for chronic pain. Bupivacaine, used in combination with opioids, is a helpful and safe method of treatment for patients who have not responded to intrathecal opioids alone. In our case, even at an unusual and extraordinary large dose of Bupivacaine and opioid combination, the patient maintained normal BP, HR and respiratory status. This treatment option may improve quality of life while providing pain relief for patients with cancer pain and already limited functional status.",Excluded,0.103971

72,"Activation of long-term synaptic plasticity causes suppression of epileptiform activity in rat hippocampal slices. Electrical stimulation of cerebral targets for the treatment of epilepsy is an area under active investigation. Recent studies have shown that chronic stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, fornix, or hippocampus may be effective in attenuating seizure frequency in animal models and in patients with intractable epilepsy. However, many questions exist, such as what are the specific electrical parameters, target sites, and mechanisms, etc., which should be investigated in animal studies before considering the routine use of chronic stimulation in epileptic patients. It is also important to understand what happens to neural activity during repetitive pulse stimulation as well as after stimulation. To this end, we hypothesized: (1) activation of synaptic plasticity suppresses epileptiform activity and (2) low frequency stimulation is an effective stimulation protocol for reducing seizure intensity and frequency. We used rat hippocampal brain slices to study how electrical stimulation affects spontaneous and evoked epileptiform activity. Further, we compared low (1 Hz) versus high (100 Hz) frequency stimulation in the same preparation. We found that orthodromic stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals for 10 min reduces the amplitude of normal responses and diminishes epileptiform activity. The onset of suppression by 1 Hz stimulation was gradual, but persistent, whereas the onset of suppression by 100 Hz was rapid; however, the effects of 100 Hz stimulation were transient. Finally, the NMDA antagonist, AP5 reversed the antiepileptic effects achieved by 1 Hz stimulation. Collectively, these data suggest that using different stimulation parameters prolonged electrical stimulation in the hippocampus may be effective in reducing seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy and that suppression by low frequency stimulation may be mediated by long-term depression (LTD).",Excluded,0.10393091

The effects of mm-waves 60.22-62.22 GHz and 75 GHz on A-type K+ currents and the effects of 61.22 GHz on Ca2+ currents of Lymnaea neurons were investigated using a whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. The open end of a rectangular waveguide covered with a thin Teflon film served as a radiator. Specific absorption rates at the waveguide outlet, inserted into physiological solution, were in the range of 0-2400 W/kg. Millimeter wave irradiation increased the peak amplitudes, activation rates, and inactivation rates of both ion currents. The changes in A-type K+ current were not dependent on the irradiation frequency. It was shown that the changes in the amplitudes and kinetics of both currents resulted from the temperature rise produced by irradiation. No additional effects of irradiation on A-type K+ current other than thermal were found when tested at the phase transition temperature or in the presence of ethanol. Ethanol reduced the thermal effect of irradiation. Millimeter waves had no effect on the steady-state activation and inactivation curves, suggesting that the membrane surface charge and binding of calcium ions to the membrane in the area of channel locations did not change.",Excluded,0.18422098

PURPOSE: To report preliminary results on using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) as an adjuvant treatment in primary soft tissue sarcoma (STS) of the extremity.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between February 2002 and March 2005, 31 adult patients with primary STS of the extremity were treated with surgery and adjuvant IMRT. Tumor size was >10 cm in 74% of patients and grade was high in 77%. Preoperative IMRT was given to 7 patients (50 Gy) and postoperative IMRT (median dose, 63 Gy) was given to 24 patients. Complete gross resection including periosteal stripping or bone resection was required in 10, and neurolysis or nerve resection in 20. The margins were positive or within 1 mm in 17. Complications from surgery and radiation therapy (RT) were assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading system.RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 23 months. Grade 1 RT dermatitis developed in 71% of patients, Grade 2 in 16%, and Grade 3 in 10%. Infectious wound complications developed in 13% and noninfectious complications in 10%.

Twelve patients presented with primary and 20 with locally recurrent disease. The tumors were high-grade in 20 patients and low-grade in 12 patients. Complete gross resection was achieved in 30 patients. HDR-IORT was given to a dose of 12-15 Gy. Additional EBRT was given to 78% of patients to a dose of 45-50.4 Gy. The two patients with gross residual disease received an additional I-125 permanent implant to a median peripheral dose of 140-160 Gy. The median follow-up was 33 months (range 1-77 mo).RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial local control rate for the whole group was 62%.

81,"Interstitial irradiation of brain metastases. Randomized studies have shown that survival in patients with single brain metastases is significantly higher after the combined treatment of surgical removal and whole-brain irradiation than after whole-brain radiation therapy alone. In patients with deep-seated lesions or those located in critical sites of the brain, as well as in cases in which the patient's general condition makes general anaesthesia difficult or impossible microsurgical resection usually cannot be performed or only with an increased surgical risk. Stereotactic radiosurgery, which can be done by means of convergent beam irradiation or by the implantation of highly loaded 125I seeds, provides an alternative to open procedures. In the following we report on our results using a stereotactic radiosurgical technique. A series of 20 treatments is presented, in which biopsy was performed and 125I seeds were implanted, both under stereotactic conditions in the same session. The 125I seeds were sealed in a teflon catheter, were left indwelling temporarily, and then removed after application of the prescribed radiation dose (6,000cGy at the tumour margin). There was only one recurrence in our series, complications occurred in only one patient by temporary aggravation of a pre-existing hemiparesis.

82,"Utility of cranial boost in addition to total body irradiation in the treatment of high risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Purpose: Total body irradiation (TBI) as part of a conditioning regimen before hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is an important component in the management of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that has relapsed or has other certain high-risk features. Controversy exists, however, as to whether a cranial boost in addition to TBI is necessary to prevent central nervous system (CNS) recurrences in these high-risk cases. Previous national trials have included a cranial boost in the absence of data to justify its use. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess risk of CNS recurrence in ALL patients treated with TBI, to identify subsets of these high-risk patients at an increased or decreased risk of CNS recurrence after TBI, and to investigate whether regimens with higher doses of cranial irradiation further reduce the risk of CNS recurrence. Methods and Materials: Charts of 67 consecutively treated patients with ALL who received TBI before HSCT were reviewed. Data including patient demographics, clinical features at presentation, conditioning regimen, donor source, use of a cranial boost, remission stage at transplant, histologic subtype, cytogenetics, and extramedullary site of presentation were retrospectively collected and correlated with the risk of subsequent CNS recurrence. Result(s): At the time of analysis, 30 (45%) patients were alive with no evidence of disease, 8 (12%) were alive with recurrence of leukemia, 7 (10.5%) had recurrent ALL but with successful salvage, 7 (11%) died subsequent to recurrence, 14 (21%) died from complications related to HCST, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up (1.5%). Of the patients who recurred after HSCT, the relapses were hematologic in 13 (57%), CNS with or without simultaneous marrow involvement in 3 (13%), and other sites in 7 (30%). Forty-one (61%) patients did not receive an extracranial boost of irradiation with TBI. Two of these patients (4.9%) suffered CNS failures compared with 1 of 26 (3.8%) who received a cranial boost (p = 0.84). None of the 40 patients who presented only with hematologic disease developed a CNS recurrence despite the fact that only 13 of 40 of these patients received a cranial boost after TBI. Cranial boost was therefore not associated with a reduction in CNS recurrence, especially in patients with only hematologic disease at presentation for which there were no failures regardless of the use of additional cranial radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): Patients who present with hematologic disease only at the time of HSCT have a low risk of CNS recurrence after TBI regardless of the use of a cranial boost, suggesting that a cranial boost may not be necessary in these patients. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.17725636

After treatment, gliomas near always recur. Differentiation of recurrent glioma from treatment induced necrosis (TIN) is not always straightforward. Both entities have the same appearance on MRI. SPECT has the advantage of lower cost and wider availability compared to PET. We set out to investigate the ability of 99mTc- Tetrofosmin (TF) SPECT to detect recurrent glioma. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty studies (21 men, 9 women, mean age 61.5 +/- 11.1 years) were eligible for the study. All patients had high-grade gliomas, received previous surgery and chemoradiation and during the follow-up period presented with a suspicion of recurrent tumor. On TF SPECT, the portion of the tumor with the highest accumulation was selected as the region of interest (ROI), lesion-versus-normal ratio (LN) was defined as the ratio of average TF counts in the lesion divided by average counts per pixel in normal white matter. Result(s): Twenty-seven patients suffered from glioblastoma, 1 from anaplastic astrocytoma and 2 from anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Histological examinations in 2 cases showed recurrent glioma. Twenty-two cases were considered to have recurrence, whereas 6 were considered to have TIN based on stable neurological symptoms with no sign of massive enlargement of the lesion on followup MR after at least 6 months. There was a statistical significant difference in TF uptake between patients with recurrent glioma and TIN (12.29 +/- 6.61 vs. 2.37 +/- 1.27 respectively; P = 0.002). The L/N cut-off threshold value representatively discriminating the two clinical entities was 4 as indicated by the ROC analysis.

Fotopoulos1; 1UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL OF IOANNINA, IOANNINA, GREECE, 22proACTINA S.A., 20 Delfon St., 15125 Athens, Greece, Athens, GREECE. Purpose(s): Treatment of high-grade gliomas involves surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. After treatment, gliomas near always recur. Differentiation of recurrent glioma from treatment induced necrosis (TIN) is not always straightforward. Both entities have the same appearance on MRI. SPECT has the advantage of lower cost and wider availability compared to PET. We set out to investigate the ability of 99mTc- Tetrofosmin (TF) SPECT to detect recurrent glioma. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty studies (21 men, 9 women, mean age 61.5 +/- 11.1 years) were eligible for the study. All patients had high-grade gliomas, received previous surgery and chemoradiation and during the follow-up period presented with a suspicion of recurrent tumor. On TF SPECT, the portion of the tumor with the highest accumulation was selected as the region of interest (ROI), lesion-versus-normal ratio (LN) was defined as the ratio of average TF counts in the lesion divided by average counts per pixel in normal white matter. Result(s): Twenty-seven patients suffered from glioblastoma, 1 from anaplastic astrocytoma and 2 from anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Histological examinations in 2 cases showed recurrent glioma. Twenty-two cases were considered to have recurrence, whereas 6 were considered to have TIN based on stable neurological symptoms with no sign of massive enlargement of the lesion on followup MR after at least 6 months. There was a statistical significant difference in TF uptake between patients with recurrent glioma and TIN (12.29 +/- 6.61 vs. 2.37 +/- 1.27 respectively; P = 0.002). The L/N cut-off threshold value representatively discriminating the two clinical entities was 4 as indicated by the ROC analysis. Conclusion(s): Brain imaging by TF could offer useful information in the workup of treated gliomas.",Excluded,0.103984125

BACKGROUND: Radiation induced brain injury ranges from acute reversible edema to late, irreversible radiation necrosis. Radiation induced temporal lobe necrosis is associated with permanent neurological deficits and occasionally progresses to death.OBJECTIVE: We present our experience with surgery on radiation induced temporal lobe necrosis (RTLN) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with special consideration of clinical presentation, surgical technique, and outcomes.METHOD: This retrospective study includes 12 patients with RTLN treated by the senior author between January 2010 and December 2014. Patients initially sought medical treatment due to headache; other symptoms were hearing loss, visual deterioration, seizure, hemiparesis, vertigo, memory loss and agnosia. A temporal approach through a linear incision was performed for all cases. RTLN was found in one side in 7 patients, and bilaterally in 5. 4 patients underwent resection of necrotic tissue bilaterally and 8 patients on one side.RESULTS: No death occurred in this series of cases. There were no post-operative complications, except 1 patient who developed aseptic meningitis. All 12 patients were free from headache. No seizure occurred in patients with preoperative epilepsy. Other symptoms such as hemiparesis and vertigo improved in all patients. Memory loss, agnosia and hearing loss did not change post-operatively in all cases. The follow-up MR images demonstrated no recurrence of necrotic lesions in all 12 patients.CONCLUSION: Neurosurgical intervention through a temporal approach with linear incision is warranted in patients with radiation induced temporal lobe necrosis with significant symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure, minimum space occupying effect on imaging, or neurological deterioration despite conservative management.",Excluded,0.1050143
88,"[Half-body irradiation. Palliative efficacy and predictive factors of response in 78 procedures]. BACKGROUND: Assessment of palliative effect of hemibody irradiation (HBI) and response-related factors.METHODS: Analysis of prospective collected data of 78 procedures on 71 patients with multiple symptomatic bone metastases, treated with 6 Gy (upper half-body) or 8 Gy (lower half-body) HBI in single fraction. Clinical improvement was quantified by self-evaluation on a visual analogic scale (SVAS) before HBI, and at 24, 48 and 72 hours, at 7 days, and at each monthly control until patient's death. Univariate analysis included: sex, Karnofsky's index, tumor origin, histology, HBI dose, and SVAS before treatment. For statistical purposes the significance level was 0.05.RESULTS: Complete (37.5%) or partial responses were observed in 72/78 (92.3%) procedures, 80% appearing during the first 72 hours. Difference between mean SVAS, before and after treatment (7.7 +/- 1.5 vs 2.8 +/- 2.5), was statistically significant (p < 0.001). A mean response duration of 101 days over a mean overall survival of 141 days implies the 70% of expected patient's life span. Any analyzed prognostic factor does not correlate significantly with HBI response.CONCLUSIONS: HBI is a powerful palliative treatment in patients with multiple symptomatic bone metastasis.",Excluded,0.1932505
89,"Survival Patterns of 5750 Stereotactic Radiosurgery-Treated Patients with Brain Metastasis as a Function of the Number of Lesions. BACKGROUND: The number of brain metastases (BMs) plays an important role in the decision between stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and whole-brain radiation therapy.METHODS: We analyzed the survival of 5750 SRS-treated patients with BM as a function of BM number. Survival analyses were performed with Kaplan-Meier analysis as well as univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.RESULTS: Patients with BMs were first categorized as those with 1, 2-4, and 5-10 BMs based on the scheme proposed by Yamamoto et al. (Lancet Oncology 2014). Median overall survival for patients with 1 BM was superior to those with 2-4 BMs (7.1 months vs. 6.4 months, P = 0.009), and survival of patients with 2-4 BMs did not differ from those with 5-10 BMs (6.4 months vs. 6.3 months, P = 0.170). The median survival of patients with >10 BMs was lower than those with 2-10 BMs (6.3 months vs. 5.5 months, P = 0.025). In a multivariate model that accounted for age, Karnofsky Performance Score, systemic disease status, tumor histology, and cumulative intracranial tumor volume, we observed a ~10% increase in hazard of death when comparing patients with 1 versus 2-10 BMs (P < 0.001) or 10 versus >10 BMs (P < 0.001). When BM number was modeled as a continuous variable rather than using the classification by Yamamoto et al., we observed a step-wise 4% increase in the hazard of death for every increment of 6-7 BM (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The contribution of BM number to overall survival is modest and should be considered as one of the many variables considered in the decision between SRS and whole-brain radiation therapy.",Excluded,0.27383974
90,"The future of intraoperative neuromonitoring in skull base surgery: Intraoperative flash visual evoked potentials a novel technique aiming to reduce the risk of intraoperative visual pathway injury. Intraoperative optic nerve/chiasmal injury is one the most devastating unexpected outcomes that may happen to patients undergoing endoscopic skull base surgery. Additionally, one of the main goals for most endoscopic skull base surgery is visual improvement, however currently there is limited ability of intraoperative monitoring for the visual pathway. We examine a novel technique which was developed in our center for monitor the visual pathway intraoperatively using continuous flash visual evoked potentials (FVEPs). The FVEPs provide continuous monitoring of the visual pathway including the optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic radiation, and visual cortex, as well as retina function. This technique has been developed at the Ottawa Hospital. Intraoperatively left then right eyes were stimulated by goggle light emitting diode (LED) stimulators (3 LEDs on each side, 640 nm peak wavelength, 10 milliseconds pulse width, 3000mCd of luminous intensity was reflected back on an angle to give uniform illumination across the whole lens, which was placed over the closed eyelids, and recording was obtained from corkscrew electrodes placed at Oz-Fz (2 cm behind Fz). The stimulus rate was 1.41Hz. 150 stimulus presentations were included in a single average. The low cut filter was <=5 Hz and the high cut filter was 100 Hz with amplifier gain 20,000 or 50,000. The total sweep time was 300 milliseconds. EEG was continuously recorded during the surgery from C4-Fz. The recorded FVEP and EEG were correlated to patients pre and postoperative visual fields and acuity. Also any droop in the FVEP will be examined in relation to any intraoperative events. Any transient FVEP amplitude changes which is caused by electrocautery were excluded from the analysis. Thirty patients who had endoscopic skull base surgery had intraoperative VEP using FVEPs in addition to other neurophysiologic monitoring. Patients demographic data, co-morbidities, diagnosis, surgical approach, length of surgery, MAP, and blood loss during surgery were recorded. All patients' visual acuity and field deficits were evaluated by neuro-ophthalmologist prior to their surgery and within 30 days after their surgery. Surgical anesthesia was maintained by TIVA (Propofol/remifentanil infusion). Changes in anesthetic agents and intraoperative events (e.g., sudden blood loss, use of vasopressors .etc) were timed and recorded. The recorded FVEP and EEG were correlated to patients pre and postoperative visual fields and acuity. We found that FVEP is reproducible throughout surgery and can predict the postsurgical outcome. Additionally, we found that FVEP is transiently affected by different stages of surgery (e.g., traction on optic chiasm, dissection, etc.). Also we found boluses of propofol and electrocautery can artificially affect FVEP.",Excluded,0.10417957
91,"Effects of Nigella sativa oil and thymoquinone on radiation-induced oxidative stress in kidney tissue of rats. Ionizing radiation leads to release of free radicals into the systemic circulation from irradiated tissues. These free radicals cause oxidative stress in distant organs. Oxidative status may be reversed by naturally occurring antioxidant agents. The aim of this study was to investigate protective and antioxidant effects of Nigella sativa oil (NSO) and thymoquinone (TQ) in kidney tissue of rats exposed to cranial irradiation. Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: IR group received irradiation (IR) to total cranium plus saline; IR plus NSO group received IR and NSO; IR plus TQ group received IR and TQ; sham group did not receive NSO, TQ or IR; control group of TQ received dimethyl sulfoxide; control group of NSO received saline. Total oxidant status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI) and lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) levels were studied as oxidative parameters, and total antioxidant status (TAS), total sulfhydryl levels, paraoxonase (PON), ceruloplasmin (Cp) and arylesterase activities were determined as antioxidative parameters in the kidney tissue of rats. Kidney TOS, OSI and LOOH levels were significantly lower in IR plus TQ, IR plus NSO and sham groups compared to IR group (p < 0.001). TAS, PON and Cp activities in IR group were significantly lower compared to the control group (p < 0.001). PON and Cp activities were significantly higher in IR plus NSO and IR plus TQ groups compared to IR group (p < 0.001). In conclusion, free radicals generated by cranial ionizing radiation exposure cause oxidative stress in kidney. NSO and TQ exhibit protective and antioxidant effects against oxidative damage in rats.",Included,0.92397016
92,"High-dose ascorbate enhances chemo-radio-sensitization in GBM. Purpose/Objective(s): Ascorbate is a water soluble vitamin that has been previously shown at milli-molar concentrations to be selectively toxic to a variety of cancer cells, including high grade gliomas, while being innocuous to normal cells. In addition, in vivo experiments with human xenografts and human clinical trials with pancreas cancer demonstrated that high plasma concentrations of ascorbate (~20 mM) are well tolerated. Since ascorbate crosses the blood brain barrier, we hypothesized that high dose ascorbate would enhance chemo-radio-sensitization in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Materials/Methods: In order to determine if high dose ascorbate enhances GBM chemo-radio-sensitization, U87 and UI-581 human GBM cells were grown in vitro for 24 hrs and then exposed to 0.5 mM ascorbate and/or temozolomide 100 mmol/L for 1 hr followed by 2 Gy of concurrent irradiation. In the xenograft studies, U87 GBM cells were grown in the flanks of nude mice and treated with ascorbate (4 mg/kg; IP), and/or ionizing radiation (6 Gy x 2 fractions 48hrs apart) for 2 weeks. Tumor growth rates were assessed daily with calipers. Result(s): Both U87 and UI 581 cell lines demonstrated that ascorbate has an additive effect on radiation+temozolomide-induced cell killing in clonogenic cell survival analysis (p<0.05). In addition, ascorbate toxicity was completely inhibited (p<0.05) with the addition of catalase confirming that ascorbate toxicity is mediated by hydrogen peroxide. Mice with U87 GBM xenograft tumors treated with ascorbate and radiation demonstrated a significantly slower tumor growth rate compared to mice receiving radiation alone (p=0.031). Median survival in mice treated with radiation alone was 21 days while mice treated with ascorbate plus radiation was 28 days (p = 0.034). Conclusion(s): These experiments support the hypothesis that high dose ascorbate enhances chemo-radio-sensitization in GBM.",Excluded,0.32100013

94,"Intracranial venous sinus stenosis: Hemodynamic assessment with two-dimensional parametric parenchymal blood flow software on digital subtraction angiography. Objective Intracranial venous sinus stenosis (IVSS) is the most common finding associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. A pressure gradient >8-10 mm Hg across the stenosis is considered hemodynamically significant, and typically responds to endovascular stent treatment. Here we assess the venous hemodynamics with two-dimensional (2D) parametric parenchymal blood flow software (Siemens-Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany) and its ability to predict significant IVSS. Methods Patients with IVSS treated at our institution between 2013 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Measurements of contrast transit time on DSA were calculated with 2D parametric parenchymal blood flow software. Values were obtained proximally and distally to the stenotic region. Venous Stenosis Index (VSI) was defined as the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) in the pre-stenotic vessel to the AUC in the post-stenotic vessel. VSI was compared between the stenotic and control groups at baseline, and before and after stent deployment in the stenotic group. The accuracy of VSI was assessed using the non-parametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results 11 patients with IVSS treated with venous stent deployment were included. Patients in the control group were similar in age, gender, and absence of major comorbidities. VSI in the IVSS group was significantly higher at baseline compared with the control group (1.42 vs 0.97, p=0.01). Area under the ROC was 0.82. After stent deployment, VSI decreased significantly compared with baseline (1.04 vs 1.42, p<0.01). Conclusion 2D parametric parenchymal blood flow software is a useful tool which can accurately evaluate significant hemodynamic venous stenosis without intracranial catheterization, added radiation exposure, additional contrast injection, and periprocedural risks.

95,"Safety and feasibility of transradial approach for cervical carotid stenting for treatment of carotid-artery stenosis. Background Traditionally, cervical carotid artery stenting is done through transfemoral or transcarotid approach. However, access site bleeding remains a significant challenge in both techniques, with a rate of about 4% in recent studies. In this study, we explore the feasibility of using transradial approach for cervical carotid stenting as a potential alternative. Methods We collected data from the prospectively maintained registries of 6 centers in the United States to include consecutive patients who underwent carotid stenting for treatment of symptomatic carotid-artery stenosis using transradial approach from October 2018 until June 2019. Collected data included baseline characteristics, procedural variables, whether there was a crossover to transfemoral access, and complications. Our primary outcome was the complication rate related to the access site. Results A total of 19 patients were included in this study. Mean age was 68.6 (+/-8), and 5 (26.3%) were females. The right radial artery access was used in all cases. Stenting of the right cervical internal carotid artery was done in 15 (78.9%) of the cases. Regarding the antispasmodic regimen used, Verapamil was used in 2 cases, Nitroglycerin was used in 6 cases, and a combination of both was used in 11 cases. Between 2000-5000 units of heparin were administered intraarterially or intravenously immediately after obtaining the access. A 6-French sheath was used in 13 cases, a 7- French sheath in 3 cases, and in 3 cases, the guide catheter (AXS Infinity, Stryker, USA) was exchanged over a 7-French sheath. Regarding guide catheters used, Benchmark (Penumbra, USA) was used in 14 cases, AXS Infinity in 3 cases, and Envoy (Codman Neuro, USA) in 2 cases. Mean contrast dose required was 93.3 (+/-48.4), radiation exposure was 14603 (+/-26118) mGy, and procedure duration was 24.6 (+/-14.2) min. None of the included patients had a complication related to access site, and only one patient required a crossover to transfemoral approach because of a device-related complication. Conclusion Transradial approach is a feasible and safe option for cervical carotid stenting. The complication rate in our study is lower than previously reported numbers for transfemoral and transcarotid carotid stenting, but larger-scale studies are needed to confirm our findings.",Excluded,0.10308261

PURPOSE: To report, from a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, on the feasibility, outcome, toxicity, and voice-handicap index (VHI) of patients with T1a glottic cancer treated by a novel intensity modulated radiation therapy technique developed at our institution to treat only the involved vocal cord: single vocal cord irradiation (SVCI).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients with T1a glottic cancer were treated by means of SVCI. Dose prescription was set to 16 x 3.63 Gy (total dose 58.08 Gy). The clinical target volume was the entire vocal cord. Setup verification was done by means of an online correction protocol using cone beam computed tomography. Data for voice quality assessment were collected prospectively at baseline, end of treatment, and 4, 6, and 12 weeks and 6, 12, and 18 months after treatment using VHI questionnaires.RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 7-50 months), the 2-year local control and overall survival rates were 100% and 90% because no single local recurrence was reported and 3 patients died because of comorbidity. All patients have completed the intended treatment schedule; no treatment interruptions and no grade 3 acute toxicity were reported. Grade 2 acute dermatitis or dysphagia was reported in only 5 patients (17%). No serious late toxicity was reported; only 1 patient developed temporary grade 2 laryngeal edema, and responded to a short-course of corticosteroid. The VHI improved significantly, from 33.5 at baseline to 9.5 and 10 at 6 weeks and 18 months, respectively (P<.001). The control group, treated to the whole larynx, had comparable local control rates (92.2% vs 100%, P=.24) but more acute toxicity (66% vs 17%, P<.0001) and higher VHI scores (23.8 and 16.7 at 6 weeks and 18 months, respectively, P<.0001).CONCLUSION: Single vocal cord irradiation is feasible and resulted in maximal local control rate at 2 years. The deterioration in VHI scores was slight and temporary and subsequently improved to normal levels. Long-term follow-up is needed to consolidate these promising results.",Excluded,0.103223786
97,"Temperature dependence of radiation-induced DNA-protein crosslinks formed under hypoxic conditions. Recently, we demonstrated that the oxygen dependence of the formation of DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) in irradiated mammalian cells measured by the alkaline elution technique is the mirror image of the oxygen dependence of radiation-induced cell killing. Consequently, these radiation-induced DPCs could be used to detect hypoxic cells or estimate the hypoxic fraction of cells in solid tumors. Although several techniques, including alkaline elution, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and nitrocellulose filter binding, have been used to measure radiation-induced DPCs, the published reports suggest that the characteristics of these DPCs may depend on both the type of sample irradiated (cellular compared to model systems, oxygenated compared to hypoxic, etc.) and the technique used to measure these radiation-induced DPCs. In the present study, the radiation-induced DPCs measured by our alkaline elution technique with and without proteinase K in the lysis solution were characterized by studying the dependence of their formation on temperature in hypoxic rat 9L brain tumor cells. Exponentially growing 9L rat brain tumor cells were rendered hypoxic at 4degreeC or at 37degreeC and then irradiated with either 7.5 Gy or 15 Gy. The cells were trypsinized at 4degreeC, either immediately after the irradiation or after one half-time of strand break repair at 37degreeC. The results demonstrated that the radiation- induced DPCs produced in 9L cells under hypoxic conditions, measured by our alkaline elution technique after low to moderate radiation doses, required metabolism for their formation, unlike the radiation-induced DPCs reported by others using the GC/MS or nitrocellulose filter binding technique.",Excluded,0.9230799
98,"Establishment and characterization of a chemoresistant glioblastoma cell line from an Iraqi patient. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumour in humans, and has a very poor prognosis. As it is a well known fact that environmental factors especially radiation exposure is a major risk for glioblastoma multiforme and Iraq had been exposed in a relatively short period to 2 international wars with documented radiation exposure, so this paper might give justification for establishment of a new glioblastoma cell line. This cell line has been established from a cerebral glioblastoma multiforme in a 72-year-old Iraqi man who underwent surgery for an intracranial tumour in 2005. The morphology, growth kinetics, karyotype, immunocytochemistry and angiogenesis factor expression profile of this ANGM5 cell line were studied. The cell line has been grown continuously for more than 200 serial passages in standard culture media presenting no sign of cell senescence. The cultured cells are elongated or multipolar in shape and the population doubling time is 28 hours. The karyotype is complex and the chromosomal number varied between 46 and 48. The cell line is resistant to Temozolomide, cisplatin, vincristine and etoposide. This chemoresistance could be explained by the overexpression of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) which found to be overexpressed by this cell line. Immunocytochemistry also showed that this cell line exhibited several characteristic features of glioblastomas, analysis of glial markers demonstrated that cells are positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and negative for nestin and calbindin. Protein microarray analysis showed very high production of TIMP2 as well as other factors that are important for the invasiveness and aggressiveness of glioblastoma. This glioblastoma cell line is a useful addition to the cell lines currently available for study of the pathobiology and chemoresistance properties of glioblastoma multiforme as well as for antitumour drug discovery.",Excluded,0.15767707
99,"Lower stimulation frequency can enhance tolerability and efficacy of pallidal deep brain stimulation for dystonia. We report the case of a patient with medically refractory primary dystonia who was treated with bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation. Stimulation at 130 Hz or higher, by means of the more ventral contacts generated capsular side effects, which made their use impractical. Consequently, the patient was treated for 9 months at 130 to 185 Hz, by means of the more dorsal contacts, achieving modest results. By reducing the stimulation frequency to 80 Hz, we were able to activate the ventral contacts without inducing side effects. Within days, the patient experienced a dramatic improvement in function that has persisted for 1 year. A further reduction in stimulation frequency to 60 Hz resulted in a worsening of his symptoms. We conclude that chronic stimulation at frequencies of <100 Hz may be efficacious in dystonia and may enhance the tolerability of stimulation by means of contacts that are positioned posteroventrally within the internal globus pallidus, nearer the internal capsule.",Excluded,0.10383128

The first schedule did not interfere with the development of normally oriented and arborizing Purkinje cells. The second schedule led to the growth of twisted and entwined stem dendrites even when, in association, with the recovered granule cells, parallel fibers were present in the molecular layer together with Purkinje cell spiny branchlets. Evidence was presented that the alignment of Purkinje cell perikarya in a monolayer does not guarantee the normal growth of Purkinje cell stem dendrites which may be dependent on the presence of basket cells.

102,"Radiobiologic models for radiosurgery. A series of initial radiobiologic investigations have been performed using three animal models. The baboon model proved to be a valuable technique to assess the in vivo radiobiologic response of single-fraction irradiation doses delivered to the primate brain stem. Multimodality neurodiagnostic testing, including CT, MR imaging, xenon-enhanced CT, evoked potential studies, and analysis of CSF myelin basic protein levels, all of which eventually were correlated with neuropathologic examination, enabled detection of lesions produced with high-dose (150 Gy) radiosurgery as early as 6 weeks. Within the first 6 months after radiosurgery, lower doses (20 Gy, 50 Gy) did not result in clinically or neurodiagnostically detectable lesions. The rat arteriovenous fistula model permits analysis of the delayed histopathologic effects of radiosurgery on an experimentally created fistula designed to mimic an AVM. The rat C6 glioma model is designed to evaluate the effect of radiosurgery in an infiltrative tumor that simulates a human malignant brain tumor. These studies are intended eventually to increase our knowledge about the safety and efficacy of radiosurgery in both the normal and tumor-implanted brains. We believe that such fundamental studies ultimately will improve our ability to reach the goals of radiosurgery: to destroy the target and spare the surrounding brain. Eventually, it may become feasible to achieve these goals by combining radiosurgical technique with both radiation sensitizers (for the treated volume) and brain protectors.

103,"Urinary, anorectal and sexual assessment after pelvic cancer surgery. Urinary, anorectal and sexual complications are often observed after pelvic cancer surgery. These symptoms may be secondary to a tumor compression or a specific surgical trauma of autonomic and somatic pathways involved in the bladder, bowel and sexual control. Indeed, pelvic organs are very close and share the same innervation, which plays an important role in the detrusor contraction, erectile function, pelvic floor contraction and global pelvi-perineal sensory functions. Moreover, pelvic irradiation and/or chemotherapy following specific surgery can also lead to neurogenic (myelopathy and plexopathy) lesions of centers and/or motor/sensory pathways, which control bladder and rectal functions. Specific bladder and rectal lesions secondary to irradiation are very common (chronic radiation cystitis, radiation rectitis). Sexual dysfunction from radiation therapy includes erectile dysfunction and vaginal stenosis. Urinary symptoms observed after pelvic surgery are principally characterized by voiding dysfunction with urinary retention or post void residual in case of neurogenic lesion. In some cases, overactive bladder symptoms (urge, frequency) are due to a radiation lesion of the bladder mucosa. Cystoscopy and urodynamic investigations are necessary to understand the different pathophysiological mechanisms of these symptoms. Treatment of urinary retention is usually self-intermittent catherization and anticholinergic drugs can be used in case of overactive bladder. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors can be used in male erectile dysfunction and vaginal dilators in case of vaginal stenosis. Perineal pain can be observed. Neurological mechanism is the main mechanism and can be confirmed by means of electrophysiological testing.

105,"Use of non-ablative dose of radiation to enhance delivery of unmodified morpholino oligonucleotides in a brain tumor model to silence mgmt and enhance the efficacy of chemo-radiation. Objective: Non-ablative Ionizing radiation ( XRT) is well known to alter neuro-vascular unit (NVU) permeability. We evaluate the use of XRT to enhance delivery of intravenously administered Morpholino Oligonucleotides designed to silence O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in a MGMT expressing human derived brain tumor xenograft model. Background(s): MGMT, a key DNA repair enzyme is associated with resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). We have previously reported the use of a non-ablative dose of ionizing radiation (XRT) to prime human cancer cells to enhance the uptake of unmodified anti-MGMT morpholino oligonucleotides (AMONs) to achieve statistically significant reduction in the in-vitro proliferation index and cell viability with a single dose of AMONs and TMZ. Our prior work has demonstrated that this is by enlarge mediated by up regulation of physiologic endocytosis after XRT. Design/Methods: Intracranial tumor (MGMT expressing human derived H460 non-small cell lung cancer, n=12) bearing athymic nude rats received a single dose of cranial radiation (2Gy) with oral TMZ for 4 consecutive days starting on the day of XRT. In addition, six animals were randomly selected to receive AMON (10.5mg/kg) 24 hrs after XRT, the remaining served as controls. All animals were euthanized and brains harvested 7 days after XRT and tumor volumes measured by immunoblotting. This experiments was repeated in human derived D283 medulloblastoma xenografts (n=12) Results: A 60% (p=0.034) reduction in MGMT expression was noted in brain tumors treated with XRT and iv AMONs. Although not significant, a 40% reduction in tumors volumes were noted in the animals treated with a single dose of AMONs and chemo-radiation. Conclusion(s): We demonstrate the first use of XRT to guide and enhance delivery of AMONS to brain tumors. In this proof of concept study, silencing MGMT enhances the toxicity of XRT and TMZ.

In borderline resectable disease, there is a lack of data to support an optimal neoadjuvant approach for curative outcomes. We describe our institutional experience with a multimodality approach. Method(s): We identified all patients with borderline resectable PNET, using NCCN criteria for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, who received neoadjuvant therapy at our institution between 2000 and 2013. The reason for borderline status was noted. Neoadjuvant regimen, radiographic response, pathologic response, surgical margins, nodal harvest, number of positive nodes, and recurrence were all documented. Result(s): A total of 112 patients had undergone pancreatic resections for neuroendocrine tumors during the study period. Six patients had borderline resectable disease. The mean age was 55 years (24-70). They all received at least 1 cycle of Temodar and Xeloda. Three of the six patients also received concurrent 5-FU and radiation. There was radiographic evidence of treatment response in all patients. Five of six patients (83 %) had negative margin (R0) resection. Low volume miliary metastatic disease in the liver was detected in 1 patient at the time of surgery. The median number of lymph nodes harvested was 12. Half of the patients had node positive disease. On pathologic review, 4 patients had histologic evidence of a moderate response. All patients are alive and 5/6 are free of disease. Range of follow up is 3.0-4.32 years. The patient with metastatic disease has had no progression and is the only one who is currently receiving any form of treatment. Conclusion(s): Neoadjuvant Temodar and Xeloda +/- radiation with 5-FU sensitization can lead to R0 resection with durable response in patients with borderline resectable PNET. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of multimodality therapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy +/- chemoradiation and surgery) in the treatment of borderline resectable PNET.",Excluded,0.106808044
107,"The use of gallium-68 labeled somatostatin receptors in PET/CT imaging. 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRTs PET/CT has become the most promising noninvasive procedure to study well-differentiated NET. Although the excellent diagnostic accuracy of the procedure is well known, its use is limited to specialized centers in Europe as parts of clinical trials. Literature reports confirm the superiority of 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRTs PET/CT for the assessment of well-differentiated NET over morphologic imaging procedures, SRS, and even PET/CT using metabolic radiotracers. 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRTs provide good visualization of NET lesions at both the primary and the metastatic sites (node, bone, liver, and unusual localizations). The advantages of their use over metabolic tracers (18F-DOPA, 18F-FDG) are not only limited to a better overall detection rate but also to the fact that they also provide data on SSTR expression on target lesions, resulting a fundamental procedure before starting therapy with either hot or cold somatostatin analogues. Moreover, they can be used also in centers without an on-site cyclotron. To interpret 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRTs images correctly, it is crucial to understand the tracer's biodistribution as well as the conditions that may alter tracer uptake. Considering that SSTR are expressed on activated lymphocytes, all areas of inflammation show 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRTs uptake. Areas of increased uptake in frequent sites of inflammation (eg, thyroid, mediastinal nodes, inguinal nodes, and nodes adjacent to areas of recent surgery/trauma) should be interpreted with care. A detailed clinical history with particular attention to concomitant disorders (eg, sarcoidosis, chronic gastritis, chronic thryoiditis) and recent invasive procedures or trauma may often help image interpretation. The presence of uptake in the head of the pancreas should always be carefully evaluated because it may often be benign. Otherwise, because the pancreas is also a frequent site of NET onset, particular attention should be devoted to the evaluation of the uptake pattern (diffuse more likely to be benign) and to the comparison with other imaging techniques. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

108,"A prospective, phase II study demonstrating the potential value and limitation of radiosurgery for spine metastases. PURPOSE: To evaluate toxicity, efficacy, feasibility, and target volume dosimetry of single-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy or radiosurgery for spine tumors.METHODS: Twenty-five patients were treated on a prospective phase II protocol of single-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy or radiosurgery for tumors near the spinal cord (N = 21). Patients received 15 Gy, given a spinal cord limit of 12 Gy to 0.1 mL for patients with no prior spine radiotherapy (N = 9), and 5 Gy to 0.5 mL for patients with prior spine radiotherapy (N = 12). The primary endpoint was toxicity. The secondary endpoint was efficacy measured with a pain scale, 2 neurologic function scales, and magnetic resonance scans. Minor endpoints were feasibility and dose coverage.RESULTS: Acute toxicity was grade 1 to 2 dysphagia or nausea. There were no late toxicities. Three patients experienced radiographic evidence of vertebral body compression in field; 2 were asymptomatic and 1 was managed with vertebroplasty. One patient progressed at the radiosurgery site (local control, 95%); 43% experienced pain relief. Most patients died or developed progressive systemic disease soon after radiosurgery. One-year progression-free survival was 5% with 60% of patients dead by 1 year. Patients with the site of radiosurgery as their only site of disease also did poorly: 2-year progression-free survival = 10% with half dead of cancer within 2 years. There were no problems planning and delivering spine radiosurgery with a 60-minute treatment slot. In patients with and without prior radiotherapy, we achieved our target-coverage goal in 91% and 95%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is an excellent option for patients with symptomatic spine metastases in previously irradiated areas. In patients without previous irradiation, the biology of metastatic cancer limits spine radiosurgery's ability to improve outcome.",Excluded,0.124407075

The purpose of this study was to determine the outcome of palliative gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) in a group of poor-risk patients with multiple brain metastases. Methods. The medical records of 72 patients with multiple brain metastases treated with GKS between October 1993 and November 9, 2001, were reviewed retrospectively. All patients presented with more than 10 lesions. There were 26 men and 46 women. The median age was 60 years (range 24-84 years). There were 39 patients with lung cancer, 18 with breast cancer, nine with metastatic melanomas, two with metastatic renal cell carcinomas, and four with other primary tumors. A total of 147 treatment sessions were required to treat 1304 sites in 72 patients. A mean of 10.4 isocenters per treatment was used. The mean tumor volume was 1.7 cm<sup>3</sup>. All patients had extracranial disease. The variables included in this study were the patient's Karnofsky Performance Scale score, age, sex, the radiation dose, initial number of lesions, and tumor volume and histopathology. Conclusions. Radiosurgery can be a powerful tool in the palliative management of advanced metastatic disease even in patients presenting with multiple brain metastases. A median of two outpatient treatments was required, allowing the advanced cancer patient to avoid protracted fractionated radiotherapy and to undergo other therapeutic treatment with an acceptable quality of life.",Excluded,0.11120243
110,"Neurotransmitter receptor expression by peripheral mononuclear cells: possible marker of neuronal damage by exposure to radiations. Peripheral mononuclear cells (PMC) express several neurotransmitter systems. Increasing evidence suggests that PMC neurotransmitter receptors are involved in modulating immune responses. It is also thought that expression of PMC neurotransmitter receptors may reflect the status of homologous brain receptors. A problem encountered with assay of PMC neurotransmitter receptors was in developing techniques suitable for their assessment in spite of low density. In this paper we summarized findings on the expression of alpha1-adrenoceptor and dopamine receptor subtypes in human peripheral blood lymphocytes characterized by radioligand binding assay techniques and immunocytochemistry. Human lymphocytes express alpha1A-, alpha1B- and alpha1D-adrenoceptor subtypes and dopamine D3, D4 and D5 receptors. Compared to radioligand binding assay, immunocytochemistry applied to cytospin-centrifuged peripheral lymphocytes allowed to assay receptor subtypes investigated in small amounts of blood. The development of sensitive and reproducible techniques for assaying PMC neurotransmitter receptor subtypes even in small amounts of blood such as those used for diagnostic purposes may allow to analyze their sensitivity to different conditions including radiation exposure.",Excluded,0.53443044
111,"Left fronto-temporal lobe dementia caused by gamma knife surgery in an elderly woman. Introduction: Dementing processes in the geriatric population are devastating and can result in early death and increased care giver burden. FTD has the core features of earlier decline and impairment in regulation of social interpersonal conduct.We describe a case of an elderly female who was found to have features of FTD which had directly resulted from gamma knife surgery. This is the first described case of left FTD secondary to gamma knife radiation to our knowledge. Case: The patient is a 76 year old African American female, otherwise healthy and on no any medications with a history of a left frontotemporal arteriovenous malformation. She underwent gamma knife radiation treatment resulting in radiation necrosis eight years prior to presentation. She presented to the clinic escorted by her daughter who observed personality changes in the patient including becoming argumentative, uncooperative, and increasingly hyper religious, with increased interpersonal conflicts surrounding patient's inability to follow-through on plans. The patient only admitted to trouble with memory. Patient was observed to have disinhibition and inappropriateness during the group interview. Geriatric Depression Scale was negative for depression. Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 15/30 with deficits including: recall 0/5, language (1/3 naming, 0/2 repetition, 0/1 fluency with only 3 F words), calculation 0/3; while attention and orientations were intact. Patient was unable to perform Trail-making test, Part B. Otherwise, she appeared robust, independent in ADL but needing some assistance with IADL. Given her behavioral changes including tactlessness and poor social judgment, executive dysfunction, memory impairment and language deficits in the context of prior left frontal lobe radiation injury, she was given the diagnosis of left predominant FTD. Conclusion(s): Isolated and localized brain anomalies and their treatment are the rare causes of brain dysfunctions. In this unfortunate case, our patient's FTD is a direct result of her iatrogenic radiation necrosis. Appropriate diagnosis of this patient's condition via correlation of her cognitive deficit with radiographic findings allowed for appropriate counseling of both the patient and family in regards to the permanent nature of her condition. This in turn resulted in acceptance of her condition by her family, establishing prognosis and helping to facilitate her long term care plan.",Excluded,0.122133024

The present work investigated the behavioral effects of a moderate exposure (1 h per day for 5 consecutive days) to a static magnetic field (SMF, 128 mT) in male rats. SMF effects were evaluated in two sets of control and SMF-exposed rats. One set of animals was used for evaluation of SMF potential effects on emotional behaviors in the elevated plus maze and in the open field. The other set of animals was tested for learning and memory abilities in different procedures of the Morris water maze task. We found no significant difference between control and SMF-exposed rats in anxiety tests. However, the ratio of open arms time in the plus maze was reduced by half in SMF-exposed rats. In the Morris water maze, SMF-exposed rats were partially impaired during the initial learning task as well as in the retention task at one week. We conclude that static magnetic field exposure altered emotional behaviors in the plus maze and led to cognitive impairments, or at least to substantial attention disorders, in the Morris water maze.",Excluded,0.106133655

This study describes ultrastructural changes in the pigmented hooded Lister rat retina, 3-12 months following X-irradiation with single doses of between 200 and 2000 cGy. The extreme radiosensitivity of the photoreceptor cells was underlined by the continued manifestation of fine structural changes and cell death up to 6 months post-radiation in animals receiving doses above 500 cGy. The retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were more radioresistant than photoreceptors and RPE cell loss was only observed at doses of more than 1500 cGy. One year after irradiation with 1500 cGy the retinal vasculature showed capillary occlusion with some evidence of recanalisation. Telangiectasia was observed in the large retinal veins. Although the inner retinal neurones and glial cells showed no evidence of direct radiation damage, the nerve fibre layer adjacent to occluded retinal vessels demonstrated ultrastructural evidence of ischaemic neuropathy and retinal oedema.

116,Surface recording of orthodromic sensory nerve action potentials in median and ulnar nerves in normal subjects. Reference values of sensory nerve compound action potentials (CAP) were established in 50 healthy subjects by examination with surface electrodes placed in a transverse and a longitudinal position at the wrist. Longitudinal electrodes record potentials of larger amplitude and shorter duration than transversally recorded CAPs. Both amplitude and duration were increased by an increase of interelectrode distance. The use of amplitude and duration as variables is encouraged by the well-defined biologic variation obtained when fixed interelectrode distance is used and when values are corrected for age and temperature. The strong correlation between amplitude and duration might indicate that the decrease of amplitude with age is caused by the reduction of conduction velocity rather than axonal loss. The ulnar nerve CAPs differ from those of the median nerve mostly with regard to influence of age and temperature. The reasons for this are discussed.,Excluded,0.103206836
117,"Irradiation inactivation studies of the dopamine D1 receptor and dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase in rat striatum. In frozen rat striatal tissue, exposed to 10 MeV electrons from a linear accelerator, the sizes of the dopamine (DA) D1 receptor and the DA-sensitive adenylate cyclase complex were determined using target size analysis. The number of D1 receptors (labelled by [3H]SCH 23390) declined monoexponentially with increasing radiation intensity, yielding a molecular weight (mol.wt.) of 80 kDa. Also the activity of the catalytic unit (C) of the adenylate cyclase (as measured by forskolin stimulation), decreased monoexponentially, however with a mol.wt. of 145 kDa. Both basal, DA- and fluoride (F-)-stimulated activity declined in a concave-downward fashion with a limiting mol.wt. of 134, 138 and 228 kDa, respectively. It was estimated that the basal and DA-stimulated activity originated from an enzyme complex with a mol.wt. of 325 kDa, a value close to the combined size of RGs and C. These data suggest that F- stimulation of the adenylate cyclase, which occurs by a Gs activation, does not cause dissociation of Gs into the alpha s and beta gamma subunits. Further, the DA-regulated adenylate cyclase apparently exists as a complex consisting of RGs and C; the mechanism of hormonal activation is a dissociation of C from this complex.",Included,0.92366415
118,"The physical basis of neuroimaging techniques. During the past 20 years, the technology of neuroimaging has improved on all fronts. Coupled with increased human ingenuity and the greater power of digital computers, modern imaging methods are capable of providing precise measurements of brain structure and sensitive assessments of brain function. The complementary nature of different techniques adds to their value, whereas the rivalry between modalities continues to catalyze the pace of technical advances. Although there may appear to be choices to be made as to which technique should be used for certain purposes, in many instances there are clear advantages and reasons to select a particular method. Some of these advantages were mentioned in this article, but here we summarize some of the relevant issues. Nuclear medicine techniques have almost no role in anatomic imaging because they have relatively poor spatial resolution and cannot hi general distinguish many types of tissues to permit structural analysis. Although CT provides excellent images of the skull, sulci, and ventricles, and is capable of providing volumetric and dynamic images with recent advances such as spiral scanning, it is unlikely in the future to challenge MR imaging for structural studies. CT exposes the patient to ionizing radiation and at acceptable doses cannot provide the soft-tissue differentiation needed for must structural studies. MR imaging systems based on magnets of moderate to high field strength provide images with contrast and spatial resolution superior to those of any other imaging method. In the foreseeable future, there appears to be no other imaging technique capable of providing the quality of anatomic information rendered by MR imaging. Furthermore, it is clear that continuing advances in MR imaging technology, such as the development of new magnets and improved RF coils, will lead to further improvements in image quality beyond that obtainable today, most likely at lower costs than previous systems. In addition, the development of higher field strength systems (operating at 3-5 T) will provide information at a spatial scale not previously available except in specialized animal imaging systems, so that in vivo resolution of 100 mum will be possible in many centers. One primary challenge will be to develop computer image analysis techniques capable of handling the wealth of anatomic detail provided by MR imaging in reasonable times and at reasonable cost. Functional methods will continue to evolve. Functional MR imaging is less than 4 years old but has already progressed to the point where it can provide data in some studies to rival the best available by other means. Questions regarding the superiority of functional MR imaging or PET, however, cannot be conclusively addressed now, and in fact may not be sensible; both will remain important for the next several years. There are realistic expectations that functional MR imaging will yield semi-quantitative measures of flow and oxygenation in individual subjects in a large number of cognitive and other tasks, and using functional MR imaging we should learn a great deal about the distribution and connectedness of neural systems involved with different functions. The major challenges will be in designing interpretable studies that lend themselves to the functional MR imaging format and in improving the reliability of the functional MR imaging data. Higher field magnets, providing images with higher SNR as well as being more sensitive to microscopic susceptibility effects, should increase the sensitivity of functional MR imaging. The ability to perform multiple repeated studies on individuals and its intrinsic safety, coupled with its high spatial resolution, assures it of an evolving role in the study of brain activation. PET will also continue to be used for many such activation studies. PET facilities uniquely can perform studies of organic disorders such as tumors, receptor systems, and metabolism. PET enjoys high sensitivity to activation and, in the right hands, can provide absolute quantification of flow changes as wel as resting flow, a task currently beyond functional MR imaging BOLD methods. Some improvements in spatial resolution and sensitivity can be expected from different detector systems.",Excluded,0.10629212

120,"An optical marker based on the UV-induced green-to-red photoconversion of a fluorescent protein. We have cloned a gene encoding a fluorescent protein from a stony coral, Trachyphyllia geoffroyi, which emits green, yellow, and red light. The protein, named Kaede, includes a tripeptide, His-Tyr-Gly, that acts as a green chromophore that can be converted to red. The red fluorescence is comparable in intensity to the green and is stable under usual aerobic conditions. We found that the green-red conversion is highly sensitive to irradiation with UV or violet light (350-400 nm), which excites the protonated form of the chromophore. The excitation lights used to elicit red and green fluorescence do not induce photoconversion. Under a conventional epifluorescence microscope, Kaede protein expressed in HeLa cells turned red in a graded fashion in response to UV illumination; maximal illumination resulted in a 2,000-fold increase in the ratio of red-to-green signal. These color-changing properties provide a simple and powerful technique for regional optical marking. A focused UV pulse creates an instantaneous plane source of red Kaede within the cytosol. The red spot spreads rapidly throughout the cytosol, indicating its free diffusibility in the compartment. The extensive diffusion allows us to delineate a single neuron in a dense culture, where processes originating from many different somata are present. Illumination of a focused UV pulse onto the soma of a Kaede-expressing neuron resulted in filling of all processes with red fluorescence, allowing visualization of contact sites between the red and green neurons of interest.",Excluded,0.10434417
121,"Timing and characteristics of perceptual attenuation by transcranial stimulation: a study using magnetic cortical stimulation and somatosensory-evoked potentials. Transcranial cortical magnetic stimulation (CMS) is a noninvasive, non-noxious procedure to induce perceptual attenuation when applied concomitant to sensory stimuli. To investigate the perceptual timing of simple stimulus features in the somatosensory modality, we applied right hemisphere CMS at different intervals following a stimulus delivered to the left hand. Different intervals between peripheral stimuli and CMS were defined according to the components of the somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP), previously obtained in response to the same stimulus. Perceptual attenuation was maximal when CMS coincided with the primary cortical response (parietal N20 potential); conversely, perception of stimulus intensity was not modified when CMS was concomitant with the N200 and P300 potentials. Using small CMS intensities, a ""perceptual dip"" was observed when CMS arrived in coincidence with the N120 potential, a SEP response thought to be originated in part in the second somatic area. Our results support the view that both N200 and P300 are post-perceptual responses. The results also suggest that the cortical processes active during the N20 and N120 potentials may be essential for the conscious perception of somatosensory stimuli delivered to the hand.",Excluded,0.10466624

124,"The neurophysiology of vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can be induced by a wide variety of stimuli such as pregnancy, space travel, raised intracranial pressure, radiation and cytotoxic drugs. The mechanisms by which all these diverse stimuli culminate in a final common act is unknown. From studies in the 1950s a model of the emetic reflex emerged consisting of a chemoreceptor trigger zone in the area postrema and a vomiting centre in the brain stem. This concept has been reviewed and revised in the light of recent studies. Many discussions of emesis involve detailed descriptions of the gastrointestinal events associated with the act of vomiting only - nausea and retching receiving little attention. Here we have tried to give a broader view by considering the neurophysiology of such events and have included nausea and retching, phenomena that are usually inseparable from vomiting. The possible biological function of these events is also discussed. The involvement of visceral systems (such as the heart, airways and gut) is included, and particular attention is paid to vagal mechanisms underlying the changes in gut motor activity. Emesis has long been thought to be organized by a 'vomiting centre'; the possibility that this vomiting centre could be the parvcellular reticular formation is reviewed, as is the concept that the 'centre' is larger than an anatomically defined single group of cells. The mechanism of action of two clinically relevant emetic stimuli - radiation and cytotoxic drugs - is considered in detail.

125,"Prevalence, predictors, and characteristics of off-treatment fatigue in breast cancer survivors. BACKGROUND: Lack of consensus regarding how to identify cancer patients with significant fatigue has hampered research regarding cancer-related fatigue (CRF).METHODS: Specific criteria were used to identify CRF cases in women with stage 0-II breast cancer (BC group, n = 304). Women completed assessments before adjuvant therapy (baseline), end of adjuvant therapy (Post-Tx), and 6 and 42 months after end of adjuvant therapy (6 and 42 Month Post-Tx). At each, women completed a clinical interview and questionnaires assessing physical and mental health. A healthy control (HC) group with no history of BC (n = 337) completed 2 similar assessments 36 months apart.RESULTS: Off-treatment CRF prevalence was 9% and 13% at the 6 and 42 Month Post-Tx assessments, respectively. Thus, 15% of the sample evidenced off-treatment CRF with 7% evidencing delayed onset CRF. CRF at the 6 Month Post-Tx assessment was associated only with CRF at baseline (OR = 3.2) and Post-Tx assessments (OR = 3.9). CRF at the 42 Month Post-Tx assessment was associated with CRF at the Post-Tx assessment (OR = 6.1), obesity at baseline, and several baseline measures of coping in response to fatigue. Off-treatment CRF cases differed markedly from CRF noncases and healthy controls on a spectrum of health status indices (mean effect size >1.0 SD).CONCLUSIONS: Results document the prevalence of off-treatment and delayed onset CRF, suggest the utility of a cognitive-behavioral model of CRF, and support NCCN guidelines recommending monitoring fatigue across the cancer trajectory.",Excluded,0.14082102

Using whole-cell patch-clamp recording we demonstrate differential oxidative inhibition of voltage-gated transient (IA) and delayed rectifier [IK(V)] K+ currents by arachidonic acid (AA) and H2O2 in CA1 neurons in hippocampal slice. We show that intracellular application of 1 pm AA or its non-metabolizable analog eicosatetraynoic acid (100 pm) reduced IA by approximately 42% but did not affect IK(V). AA shifted the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of IA by 12 mV to more negative potentials whereas the rate of inactivation was unchanged. Surprisingly, intracellular glutathione (GSH, 20 mm) enhanced the effect of AA on maximal IA (-62%) and with AA slowed inactivation of IA. The combination of GSH and extracellular ascorbate (0.4 mm) prevented reduction of IA by AA. Intracellular Trolox (a vitamin E analog, 10 microm) reduced IA by 61%and IK(V) by 39%. Like AA, intracellular Trolox caused a 10-mV left shift of IA steady-state inactivation but Trolox and AA did not cause a shift when coapplied. Extracellular Trolox (100 microm) had no effects on IA. H2O2 (80 microm) reduced both IA and IK(V) in a GSH- and ascorbate-sensitive manner and slowed the rate of inactivation of IA by a factor of 2. Coapplication of H2O2 with GSH and extracellular ascorbate caused approximately 22 mV negative shifts of both steady-state inactivation and activation. We conclude that AA is extremely potent in affecting IA by oxidative modifications. Antioxidants can augment these effects, probably by catalysis of the underlying reactions between oxidants and IA channel proteins.",Excluded,0.10553727

AIM: To compare a single fraction of 8 Gy with a course of multifraction radiotherapy in terms of long-term benefits and short-term side effects in patients with painful skeletal metastases.METHODS: Seven hundred and sixty-five patients with painful skeletal metastases requiring palliative radiotherapy were entered into a prospective randomised clinical trial comparing 8 Gy single fraction with a multifraction regimen (20 Gy/5 fractions or 30 Gy/10 fractions). Patients recorded pain severity and analgesic requirements on self-assessment questionnaires before treatment, at 2 weeks and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12 months after radiotherapy. Pain relief was the primary endpoint of treatment benefit. Short-term side-effects were compared in a subset of 133 consecutive patients who graded nausea, vomiting and antiemetic usage prior to treatment and at daily intervals from days I to 14.RESULTS: Overall survival at 12 months was 44%, with no statistically significant difference apparent between randomised groups. There were no differences in the time to first improvement in pain, time to complete pain relief or in time to first increase in pain at any time up to 12 months from randomisation, nor in the class of analgesic used. Retreatment was twice as common after 8 Gy than after multifraction radiotherapy, although retreatment for residual or recurrent pain did not reflect a difference between randomised groups in the probability of pain relief. The difference in the rate of retreatment is thought to reflect a greater readiness to prescribe radiotherapy after a single fraction, not a greater need. There were no significant differences in the incidence of nausea, vomiting, spinal cord compression or pathological fracture between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: A single fraction of 8 Gy is as safe and effective as a multifraction regimen for the palliation of metastatic bone pain for at least 12 months. The greater convenience and lower cost make 8 Gy single fraction the treatment of choice for the majority of patients.",Excluded,0.11213498

150,"Effect of microradiosurgical transections upon kainate seizure focus. Multiple subpial transections (MST) sever horizontal intracortical fibers involved in the propagation of seizures, while preserving vertical fibers which are essential for brain function. Less damaging to the brain than a traditional resection,MST still exposes patients to the risks of craniotomy. Microradiosurgery uses synchrotron generated sub-millimetric beams of radiation. Arrays of tightly spaced microbeams produce a lethal effect only to those cells directly in the beam path. Low energy x-rays used for microradiosurgery have a small tissue half-value layer making the technique ideal for treating superficial brain lesions. Video-EEG (VEEG) data was recorded immediately following kainate injected into sensorimotor cortex. Rats then underwent irradiation with an array of parallel microbeams delivered to the seizure focus.Subclinical electrographic ictal events remained frequent up to 10 hours post irradiation. More prolonged seizures exhibited typical rat complex partial seizure semiologies. These results demonstrate the feasibility of recording VEEG before and after precise microbeam irradiation from a synchrotron source; demonstrating a methodology which will be useful for future experiments serving to optimize microbeam doses and configuration in preparation for the treatment of epilepsy in humans. The results show some promise that microradiosurgical MST can limit the spread of seizures without causing clinically evident neurological damage.",Excluded,0.67657363

Purpose: N-([<sup>11</sup>C]methyl)benperidol ([<sup>11</sup>C]NMB) can be used for positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of D<inf>2</inf>-like dopamine receptor binding in vivo. We report the absorbed radiation dosimetry of i.v.-administered <sup>11</sup>C-NMB, a critical step before applying this radioligand to imaging studies in humans. Material(s) and Method(s): Whole-body PET imaging with a CTI/Siemens ECAT 953B scanner was done in a male and a female baboon. After i.v. injection of 444-1221 MBq of <sup>11</sup>C-NMB, sequential images taken from the head to the pelvis were collected for 3 h. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were identified that entirely encompassed small organs (whole brain, striatum, eyes, and myocardium). Large organs (liver, lungs, kidneys, lower large intestine, and urinary bladder) were sampled by drawing representative regions within the organ volume. Time-activity curves for each VOI were extracted from the PET, and organ residence times were calculated by analytical integration of a multi-exponential fit of the time-activity curves. Human radiation doses were estimated using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 and the standard human model. Result(s): Highest retention was observed in the blood and liver, each with total residence times of 1.5 min. The highest absorbed radiation doses were to the heart (10.5 mGy/kBq) and kidney (9.19 mGy/kBq), making these the critical organs for [<sup>11</sup>C]NMB. A heart absorption of 50 mGy would result from an injected dose of 4,762 MBq [<sup>11</sup>C]NMB. Conclusion(s): Thus, this study suggests that up to 4,762 MBq of [<sup>11</sup>C]NMB can be safely administered to human subjects for PET studies. Total body dose and effective dose for [<sup>11</sup>C]NMB are 2.82 mGy/kBq and 3.7 mSv/kBq, respectively. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded,0.10300426

To evaluate the prognostic factors and indexes of a series of 93 patients with breast cancer and brain metastases (BM) in a single institution. Treatment outcomes were evaluated according to the major prognostic indexes (RPA, BSBM, GPA scores) and breast cancer subtypes. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) were identified. The median OS values according to GPA 0-1, 1.5-2, 2.5-3 and 3.5-4, were 4.5, 9.5, 14.2 and 19.1 months, respectively (p < 0.0001) and according to genetic subtypes, they were 5, 14.2, 16.5 and 17.1 months for basal-like, luminal A and B and HER, respectively (p = 0.04). Using multivariate analysis, we established a new grading system using the six factors that were identified as indicators of longer survival: age under 60 (p = 0.001), high KPS (p = 0.007), primary tumor control (p = 0.05), low number of extracranial metastases and BM (p = 0.01 and 0.0002, respectively) and triple negative subtype (p = 0.002). Three groups with significantly different median survival times were identified: 4.1, 9.5 and 26.3 months, respectively (p < 0.0001).

PURPOSE: Bevacizumab and stereotactic treatment are efficient combined or alone in relapse glioma. However, patterns of relapse after this kind of salvage treatment have never been studied. The purpose of this unicentric retrospective analysis was to assess and understand the patterns of relapse of high grade glioma treated with stereotactic radiation, with or without bevacizumab.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with high grade glioma relapse received a stereotactic radiation; among them two patients received temozolomide and eight patients received bevacizumab; among the latter, four received also irinotecan. We matched the stereotactic radiation treatment planning scan with the images of the first treatment and of the second relapse in order to determine the patterns of failure and associate dosimetric profile.RESULTS: For the total population, median follow-up from the first diagnosis and relapse were 46.1 and 17.6 months, respectively. Among the 13 patients who relapsed, ten did not receive chemotherapy and three received it (P<0.05), two received temozolomide and one bevacizumab. Patients who received bevacizumab had no ""out-of-field"" recurrences. Among the 32 irradiated relapses, 15 were ""in-field"" recurrences; among them two were treated with bevacizumab and 13 were not (P<0.05).

160,"Monoaminergic modulation of the Na+-activated K+ channel in Kenyon cells isolated from the mushroom body of the cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) brain. Recent studies have suggested that octopamine (OA) and dopamine (DA) play important roles in mediating the reward and punishment signals, respectively, in olfactory learning in insect. However, their target molecules and the signaling mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we showed for the first time that OA and DA modulate the Na+-activated K+ (KNa) channels in an opposite way in Kenyon cells isolated from the mushroom body of the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus. Patch-clamp recordings showed that the single-channel conductance of the KNa channel was about 122 pS with high K+ in the patch pipettes. The channel was found to be activated by intracellular Na+ but less activated by Li+. K+ channel blockers TEA and quinidine reduced the open probability (Po) of this channel. Bath application of OA and DA respectively increased and decreased the Po of KNa channel currents. An increase and a decrease in Po of KNa channels were also observed by applying the membrane-permeable analogs 8-Br-cyclic-AMP and 8-Br-cGMP, respectively. Furthermore, it was revealed that cAMP-induced increase and cGMP-induced decrease in Po were attenuated by the specific protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 and protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor KT5823, respectively. These results indicate that the KNa channel is a target molecule for OA and DA and that cAMP/PKA and cGMP/PKG signaling pathways are also involved in the modulation of KNa channels.",Excluded,0.10328048
161,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an inexorably progressive motoneuron disease, is accompanied by significantly increased markers of inflammation. These inflammatory constituents could protect, harm, do neither, or do both. Objective(s): Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed in patients with sporadic ALS to suppress neuroinflammation and improve clinical outcomes after CNS engraftment. Method(s): Six patients with definite ALS received total body irradiation followed by peripheral blood HSCT infusion from human leukocyte antigen identically matched sibling donors. Disease progression and survival were assessed monthly and compared with matched historic database patients. Autopsy samples from brain and spinal cord were examined immunohistochemically and by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Donor-derived DNA in brain and spinal cord tissue was evaluated for the extent of chimerism. Result(s): No clinical benefits were evident. Four patients were 100% engrafted; postmortem tissue examination in two of the 100% engrafted patients demonstrated 16% to 38% donor-derived DNA at sites with motoneuron pathology, which may correspond to the observed increased CD68 or CD1a-positive cells. Neither donor DNA nor increased cell numbers were found in several unaffected brain regions. A third minimally engrafted patient had neither donor DNA nor increased infiltrating cells in the CNS. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that peripheral cells derived from donor hematopoietic stem cells can enter the human CNS primarily at sites of motoneuron pathology and engraft as immunomodulatory cells. Although unmodified hematopoietic stem cells did not benefit these sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, such cells may provide a cellular vehicle for future CNS gene therapy. © 2008 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.",Excluded,0.108242884
162,"Phosphorylation of alphaB-crystallin alters chaperone function through loss of dimeric substructure. Phosphorylation is the most common posttranslational modification of the alpha-crystallins in the human lens. These phosphorylated forms are not only important because of their abundance in aging lenses and the implications for cataract but also because they have been identified in patients with degenerative brain disease. By using mimics corresponding to the reported in vivo phosphorylation sites in the human lens, we have examined the effects of phosphorylation upon the chaperone-like properties and structure of alphaB-crystallin. Here we show that phosphorylation of alphaB-crystallin at Ser-45 results in uncontrolled aggregation. By using an innovative tandem mass spectrometry approach, we demonstrate how this alteration in behavior stems from disruption of dimeric substructure within the polydisperse alphaB-crystallin assembly. This structural perturbation appears to disturb the housekeeping role of alphaB-crystallin and consequently has important implications for the disease states caused by protein aggregation in the lens and deposition in non-lenticular tissue.",Excluded,0.10269008

PET attenuation correction (AC) on systems lacking CT/transmission scanning, such as dedicated brain PET scanners and hybrid PET/MRI, is challenging. Direct AC in image-space, wherein PET images corrected for attenuation and scatter are synthesized from nonattenuation corrected PET (PET-nonAC) images in an end-to-end fashion using deep learning approaches (DLAC) is evaluated for various radiotracers used in molecular neuroimaging studies. One hundred eighty brain PET scans acquired using <sup>18</sup>F-FDG, <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA, <sup>18</sup>F-Flortaucipir (targeting tau pathology), and <sup>18</sup>F-Flutemetamol (targeting amyloid pathology) radiotracers (40 + 5, training/validation + external test, subjects for each radiotracer) were included. The PET data were reconstructed using CT-based AC (CTAC) to generate reference PET-CTAC and without AC to produce PET-nonAC images. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to generate PET attenuation corrected images (PET-DLAC) from PET-nonAC. The quantitative accuracy of this approach was investigated separately for each radiotracer considering the values obtained from PET-CTAC images as reference. A segmented AC map (PET-SegAC) containing soft-tissue and background air was also included in the evaluation. Quantitative analysis of PET images demonstrated superior performance of the DLAC approach compared to SegAC technique for all tracers. Despite the relatively low quantitative bias observed when using the DLAC approach, this approach appears vulnerable to outliers, resulting in noticeable local pseudo uptake and false cold regions. Direct AC in image-space using deep learning demonstrated quantitatively acceptable performance with less than 9% absolute SUV bias for the four different investigated neuroimaging radiotracers. However, this approach is vulnerable to outliers which result in large local quantitative bias. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

164,"Effects of stimulus blocking, light scattering, and distortion on multifocal electroretinogram. PURPOSE: To investigate how the multifocal electroretinogram (ERG) is altered in conditions of blocking, light scattering, or distortion of the stimulus that are seen in ocular pathologies.METHODS: A central 40 degree-diameter stimulus pattern consisting of 61 hexagons was presented on a cathode ray tube monitor at a rate of 75 Hz according to the pseudo-random binary M sequence by the Veris computer program. Localized responses corresponding to each hexagon and ERG topographies were displayed on the computer screen. Central scotoma was simulated by blocking the central area of the stimulus, visual field constriction by blocking the outer area of the stimulus, mild cataract by using acrylic filters that caused light scatter, and epiretinal membrane by using a wavy plastic plate that produced metamorphopsia.RESULTS: The responses from the blocked area were nonrecordable whether blockage was central or peripheral; responses from the adjacent unblocked area had a larger amplitude when large areas of the stimulus were blocked. The light scatter that decreased vision from 20/20 to 20/70 did not significantly decrease response amplitudes. Responses from areas in which the stimulus pattern was distorted were minimally affected.CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the system records local ERGs from the macula and outside the macula. It can detect the area where the stimulus is blocked. Moderate light scattering and distortion do not cause loss of local ERG characteristics.",Excluded,0.10521347

OBJECT: The object of this study was to determine whether the radiation dose rate affects clinical outcomes in patients who undergo stereotactic Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) to manage typical trigeminal neuralgia (TN).METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied pain relief in 165 patients with medically intractable TN, who underwent 80-Gy GKS using a single 4-mm collimator between 1994 and 2005. No patient had received prior radiation treatment. The measured relative helmet output factor of the Gamma Knife was 0.8 throughout this interval, and the dose rate varied from 1.21 Gy/minute to 3.74 Gy/minute (median 2.06 Gy/minute). Irradiation time varied from 26.73 to 95.11 minutes. The authors divided patients into a low-dose-rate (LDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 1.21 to 2.05 Gy/minute, and a high-dose-rate (HDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 2.06 to 3.74 Gy/minute. Post-GKS, the patients' pain control was determined using the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain scale. There was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to history of prior microvascular decompression (p = 0.410) or peripheral neuroablative procedures (p = 0.583). The length of symptoms in patients varied from 3 to 414 months with a median of 84 months (p = 0.698). Median follow-up was 26 months with a maximum of 139 months.RESULTS: Initial pain relief was obtained in 71% of patients in the LDR group and 78% in the HDR group (p = 0.547). Patients who initially obtained improved pain relief (BNI Scores I-IIIa) after GKS maintained pain control for median durations of 52 months (LDR group) and 54 months (HDR group) (p = 0.403). New or increased facial sensory dysfunction was found in 14.5% of patients in the LDR group and in 19.3% of patients in the HDR group (p = 0.479).CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that the GKS dose rate did not affect pain control or morbidity within the range of 1.21-3.74 Gy/minute. Cobalt 60 source decay did not affect outcomes of GKS for TN pain management, even for dose rates approximating a 2-half-life decay of the isotope.",Excluded,0.19801944
166,"Effects of exposure of the ear to GSM microwaves: in vivo and in vitro experimental studies. The effects of mobile phone (GSM) microwaves on the ears of guinea pigs were investigated in two in vivo experiments and one in vitro experiment. In the first experiment, three groups of eight guinea pigs had their left ear exposed for 1 h/day, 5 days/week, for 2 months, to GSM microwaves (900 MHz. GSM modulated) at specific absorption rates (SARs) of 1, 2 and 4 W/kg respectively, and a fourth group was sham-exposed. Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured for each ear before exposure, at the end of the 2-month exposure period, and 2 months later. In the second experiment, the same protocol was applied to eight sham-exposed and 16 exposed guinea pigs at 4W/kg, but the auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds were monitored. Repeated-measures ANOVA showed no difference in DPOAE amplitudes or in ABR thresholds between the exposed and non-exposed ears and between the sham-exposed and exposed groups In the course of the second experiment, acute effects were also investigated by measuring once, in all animals, ABR thresholds just before and just after the 1-h exposure: no statistically significant difference was observed. In vitro, the two organs of Corti (OCs) of newborn rats (n=15) were isolated and placed in culture. For each animal, one OC was exposed for 24-48 h to 1 W/kg GSM microwaves, and the other was sham-exposed. After 2-3 days of culture, all OCs were observed under light microscopy. They all appeared normal to naive observers at this stage of development. These results provided no evidence that microwave radiation, at the levels produced by mobile phones, caused damage to the inner ear or the auditory pathways in our experimental animals.",Excluded,0.10422332

169,"Radiation-Induced Optic Neuropathy: Clinical and Imaging Profile of Twelve Patients. BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RON) is a form of delayed radionecrosis of the anterior visual pathways, which develops within months to years after external cranial irradiation and causes severe and irreversible vision loss. Small series reports have adequately documented its clinical features, but imaging characteristics have been less completely described.METHODS: We accrued cases from the University of Michigan Neuro-Ophthalmology Clinic files and from cases coded as ""radiation optic neuropathy"" at the University of Michigan Medical Center between 1994 and 2017. All patients had undergone 3D-conformal linear accelerator (photon) external beam radiation. We collected clinical details of vision loss, including the temporal relationship to radiation. A single neuroradiologist (E.A.L.) evaluated all available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, noting the presence of enhancement, expansion, or volume loss of the optic nerves or chiasm, corresponding T2 signal abnormalities, and the absence of demyelination or confounding compressive lesions.RESULTS: Twelve patients (15 eyes) met inclusion criteria. Vision loss was usually monocular at outset, but both optic nerves were eventually involved in 3 (25%) patients. Although usually sudden in onset, vision loss often declined slowly over many months, frequently to finger counting, or worse without recovery. An afferent pupillary defect was always present at the time of presentation. Most affected optic discs were pale at the time of first visual symptoms, indicating that subclinical optic nerve damage had been present for several weeks. The latency from completion of radiation to onset of vision loss ranged from 7 to 48 months (average: 18 months). In 2 patients, radiation was delivered to the whole brain, rather than being limited to the anterior visual pathway. MRI typically displayed a discrete region of enhancement of the affected prechiasmatic optic nerve, often with expansion and high T2 signal in the enhancing segment. In 3 affected eyes, enhancement was apparent on imaging completed 3-6 weeks before the onset of vision loss. In one patient, segmental prechiasmatic enhancement became evident only on repeat MRI completed 7 months after vision loss. The duration of enhancement among 9 eyes with follow-up MRIs was at least 2 months, but in one case, enhancement was still present on a study performed 17 months after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: This study further delineates the profile of RON. Visual loss is often acute, profound, and monocular but may decline slowly after acute onset and later affect both optic nerves. High-resolution MRI of the optic nerves usually will display enhancement of a discrete segment of the intracranial prechiasmatic optic nerve, often with accompanying expansion and T2 hyperintensity. In some cases, these imaging features may precede vision loss. They may be subtle or appear after vision loss. Enhancement lingers for a wide interval, ranging in this study from 2 to at least 17 months. Recognition of these imaging characteristics assists in confirmation of the diagnosis of RON.",Excluded,0.11448053
170,"Dosimetric predictive factors for radiation pneumonitis in sterotactic body radiotherapy. Purpose/Objective: To investigate the correlation of lung dose volume parameters with radiation pneumonitis (RP) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pulmonary metastases treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Material(s) and Method(s): From January 2006 to January 2014, 72 patients with primary or metastatic lung tumors underwent SBRT with total dose of 40 Gy (47.22%) and 50 Gy (52.78%) in 5 fractions with Linac or Tomotherapy. The dose was prescribed to the isocenter, the fractionation schedule has been chosen according to diameter and location of the lesion (central vs peripheral). 54/72 (75%) patients had primary lung cancer and 18/72 (25%) patients had solitary secondary lung lesion. Dosimetric factors were extracted from the dose-volume histogram (DVH). PTV consisted of GTV plus 1 cm in cranial-caudal direction and 0.5 cm in others directions; after installation of Tomotherapy, expansion was 0.5 cm in all directions. Median tumor diameter was 20 mm (range 10-60) and 11 mm (5-22), median GTV was 5.87 cc (0.88-27.90) and 3.34 cc (0.33-9.07), median PTV was 28.48 cc (2.7-133.8) and 14.785 cc (7.3-113.3) for primary and secondary lung cancer, respectively. Response was evaluated with CT and/or FDG-PET imaging 3-4 months after the end of SBRT and every 4-6 months thereafter. Toxicity was evaluated according to CTCAE v3.0. We retrospectively analyzed clinical, treatment-related and dosimetric factors. Factors including total radiation dose, site of lesion, diameter, GTV, PTV, V5, V10, V20, V30 and mean lung dose (MLD) of ipsilateral lung were considered in order to evaluate the development of RP using the Cox proportional hazards model. The predictive accuracy for RP was assessed by using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis to define the cut-off points for significant parameters. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 20.5 months (range 4 - 91) and 18 months (14-80) for primary and secondary lung cancer. RP G1-2 has been observed in 23/54 patients (42.59%); no pulmonary toxicity >G2 has occurred, as there has been no toxicity of controlateral lung and other organs at risk. Univariate statistical analysis showed that GTV(p=0.036), PTV (p=0.022), MLD (p=0.003) and V5 (p=0.002), V10 (p=0.002), V20 (p=0.012), V30 (p=0.002) were significant variables for the risk of developing RP. Multivariate statistical analysis has found that the predictor variables of RP are V5 (p=0.004), V10 (p=0.009), V20 (p=0.014), V30 (p=0.007) and the MLD (p=0.011). The greatest risk was connected to the variable V30 (HR 1.985 ). On the ROC curve, the cut-off values of ipsilateral lung V5,V10,V20,V30 and MLD were 29.50%,19.50%,9.55%,4.58% and 4.7%, respectively (Fig.1). A cutoff of 4.58% for V30 had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 82.1%. (Figure Presented) Conclusion(s): In our study stereotactic body radiotherapy was well tolerated for primary and secondary lung cancer treatment.

172,"Does occupational exposure to argon laser radiation decrease colour contrast sensitivity in UK ophthalmologists?. The objects of the study were to determine: (1) whether United Kingdom ophthalmologists who used argon lasers had the elevation of colour-contrast thresholds previously discovered and (2) whether other users of argon lasers showed any unusual loss of colour vision. A total of 1072 UK ophthalmologists filled in a questionnaire about their professional use of lasers, the length of time spent operating, and their out-of-doors activities. Their colour vision was then tested by a new sensitive system, and if any abnormality was detected, a clinical eye examination was performed. The results were as follows: (1) Colour vision testing was shown to be reliable. Any self-selection bias was excluded. Test-retest variability was small. Normal results did not change during the survey. (2) A number of men with high red-green thresholds were discovered. Some were aware of their congenital insensitivity. The frequency of all such defects was less than the known incidence of congenital colour deficiency in the male population. (3) Additionally a number of high tritan (blue-yellow) thresholds were encountered, some associated with reported diabetes and hypertension. In other cases of this type, undetected or unacknowledged systemic disease may be present. (4) After making allowance for all these incidental causes of loss of colour vision, and for the effect of age on colour vision (which is very small) only four of the sample were > 2 SD above normal. (5) However, the average blue-yellow thresholds of ophthalmologists were slightly and highly significantly raised compared with normal, in the first year of the survey. During the second and third years, the mean thresholds declined to normal. Similar but less significant findings were found for protan thresholds. It is concluded that the enhanced safety precautions recently introduced are associated with a recovery of colour vision in this population, demonstrating that any changes to individuals were reversible.

173,"Induction chemotherapy with carboplatin-paclitaxel followed by standard radiotherapy with concurrent daily low-dose cisplatin plus weekly paclitaxel for inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer. Both induction chemotherapy and concurrent platinating agents have been shown to improve results of thoracic irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This phase II study investigated activity and feasibility of a novel chemoradiation regimen, including platinum and paclitaxel, both as induction chemotherapy and concurrently with thoracic radiotherapy. Previously untreated patients with histologically/cytologically proven unresectable stage I-III NSCLC were eligible. Induction chemotherapy consisted of 2 courses of 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> paclitaxel and carboplatin at AUC of 6 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks. From day 43, continuous thoracic irradiation (60 Gy in 30 fractions radiotherapy for 6 weeks) was given concurrently with daily cisplatin at a dose of 5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously and weekly paclitaxel at a dose of 45 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 6 weeks. Fifteen patients were accrued in the first stage of the trial. According to the previous statistical considerations, accrual at the second stage of the study was halted as a result of the achievement an insufficient number of successes. Major toxicity of combined chemoradiation was grade III-IV esophagitis requiring hospitalization for artificial nutrition, which occurred in 58% of patients. Other toxicities included grade II-IV fatigue in 75% of patients and grade I-IV neuromuscular toxicity in 67%. Only 7 patients completed the treatment program as scheduled. Eight patients (53.3%; 95% confidence interval, 26.5-78.7%) had a major response (5 partial response, 3 complete response), 2 patients had disease progression, and 1 was stable at the end of treatment. Four patients died early. With a median follow up of 38 months, the median survival was 12 months. A combined chemoradiation program, including platinum and paclitaxel, appears difficult to deliver at full dose as a result of toxicity, mainly esophagitis. More active and less toxic combined modality treatments need to be developed for inoperable NSCLC.",Excluded,0.10295504
174,"Neuronal precursors within the adult rat subventricular zone differentiate into dopaminergic neurons after substantia nigra lesion and chromaffin cell transplant. Neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain continues in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Neuronal precursors from the SVZ migrate along the rostral migratory stream to replace olfactory bulb interneurons. After the destruction of the nigro-striatal pathway (SN-lesion), some SVZ precursors begin to express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuronal markers (NeuN). Grafting of chromaffin cells (CCs) into the denervated striatum increases the number of TH+ cells (SVZ TH+ cells; Arias-Carrion et al., 2004). This study examines the functional properties of these newly differentiating TH+ cells. Under whole-cell patch-clamp, most SVZ cells recorded from lesioned and grafted animals (either TH+ or TH-) were non-excitable. Nevertheless, a small percentage of SVZ TH+ cells had the electrophysiologic phenotype of mature dopaminergic neurons and showed spontaneous postsynaptic potentials. Dopamine (DA) release was measured in SVZ and striatum from both control and SN-lesioned rats. As expected, 12 weeks after SN lesion, DA release decreased drastically. Nevertheless, 8 weeks after CCs graft, release from the SVZ of SN-lesioned rats recovered, and even surpassed that from control SVZ, suggesting that newly formed SVZ TH+ cells release DA. This study shows for the first time that in response to SN-lesions and CC grafts neural precursors within the SVZ change their developmental program, by not only expressing TH, but more importantly by acquiring excitable properties of mature dopaminergic neurons. Additionally, the release of DA in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and the attraction of synaptic afferents from neighboring neuronal networks gives further significance to the overall findings, whose potential importance is discussed.",Excluded,0.108879104
175,"Risk factors for early death after surgery in patients with brain metastases: reevaluation of the indications for and role of surgery. Surgical resection remains an important option for the treatment of brain metastases despite recent advancements in radiotherapy and systemic therapy. When selecting surgical candidates, it is important to exclude terminal cases who will receive neither a survival benefit nor an improvement in their quality of life. We reviewed a total of 264 surgical cases of brain metastases and analyzed the clinical characteristics of early death in order to clarify the indication for and the role of surgery. The median survival time (MST) after surgery in all cases was 12.4 months. Early death was defined as death within 6 months, and 23% (62 cases) of this series were succumbed to this. A decrease in postoperative Karnofsky performance status (KPS) (<70) (P = 0.041), lack of systemic therapy after surgery (P < 0.0001), and uncontrolled extracranial malignancies (P = 0.0022) were significantly related to early death in multivariate analysis, while preoperative KPS (<70) and recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class were related to early death only in univariate analysis (P < 0.05). When analyzing patients with uncontrolled extracranial malignancies and those with a postoperative KPS score of 70 or greater (who were generally candidates for systemic therapy), the MST was significantly longer in the systemic therapy (+) group compared with the systemic therapy (-) group (12.5 vs. 5.6 months; P = 0.0026). Our data indicate that the postoperative RPA class and treatment strategy were associated with early death.

The current treatment recommendation is systemic high-dose methotrexate followed by whole cranial irradiation treatment. This strategy produces a response rate of 80-90% and an MST of more than 30 months.

The effect of SV40 transformation and immortalisation on the gamma-irradiation survival of skin derived fibroblasts from normal individuals and from ataxia-telangiectasia patients and heterozygotes. We have compared cell killing following 60Co gamma irradiation in 22 primary human fibroblast strains, nine SV40-immortalized human fibroblast lines and seven SV40-transformed pre-crisis human fibroblast cultures. We have examined material from normal individuals, from ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients and from A-T heterozygotes. We have confirmed the greater sensitivity of A-T derived cells to gamma radiation. The distinction between A-T and normal cells is maintained in cells immortalized by SV40 virus but the immortal cells are more gamma radiation resistant than the corresponding primary fibroblasts. Cells transformed by plasmids (pSV3gpt and pSV3neo) expressing SV40 T-antigen, both pre- and post-crisis, show this increased resistance, indicating that it is expression of SV40 T-antigen, rather than immortalization per se which is responsible for the change. We use D0, obtained from a straight line fit, and D, estimated from a multitarget curve, as parameters to compare radiosensitivity. We suggest that both have their advantages; D0 is perhaps more reproducible, but D is more realistic when comparing shouldered and non-shouldered data.",Excluded,0.9233048
178,"Phase measurement of cognitive impairment specific to radiotherapy. PURPOSE: Memory impairment is an early-delayed effect of radiotherapy (RT). The prospective longitudinal measurement of the cognitive phase effects from RT was conducted on treated and untreated brain tumor patients. The study design investigated semantic vs. perceptual and visual vs. verbal memory to determine the most disease-specific measure of RT-related changes and understanding of the neurotoxicity from RT to the brain.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tests of memory that had previously shown RT-related phasic changes were compared with experimental tests of memory to test hypotheses about cognition targeted to the neural toxicity of RT. The results from 41 irradiated and 29 nonirradiated patients with low-grade, supratentorial tumors were analyzed. The methods controlled for comorbid white matter risk, recurrence, interval after treatment, and age (18-69 years). The effects were examined before RT and at three points after RT to 1 year using a mixed effects model that included interval, group, surgical status, medication use, practice, and individual random effects. Four new tests of memory and other candidate cognitive tests were investigated, and a post hoc analysis of a comprehensive battery of tests was performed to identify the cognitive processes most specific to RT.RESULTS: The RT effects on memory were identified in the treated group only; among the new tests of memory and the complete neurocognitive battery, the RT effects were significant only for delayed recall (p < 0.009) and interval to recognize (p < 0.002). Tumor location was not related to the treatment effect. Memory decline was specific to retrieval of semantic memories; a double dissociation of semantic from perceptual visual memory was demonstrated in the RT group.CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate memory dependent on the semantic cortex and the hippocampal memory system. A cognitive measurement that is brief but specific to neural mechanisms is effective and feasible for studies of RT damage.",Included,0.91915286
179,"Postoperative radiation for lung cancer metastatic to the brain. PURPOSE: Although resection of single brain metastases and postoperative whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) improves survival, compared with treatment using WBRT alone, the value of postoperative WBRT after resection of brain metastases is controversial. We analyzed the largest reported series of lung cancer patients with resected brain metastases to evaluate the impact of postoperative WBRT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1989, 185 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) underwent resection of brain metastases. Patients who had received preoperative WBRT (23%, 42 of 185) were excluded. The remaining patients were divided into group A (no WBRT; n = 32), group B (patients received WBRT and were prognostically matched to group A; n = 32), and group C (all other WBRT patients; n = 79). Most patients received postoperative doses of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Higher doses were used in 16% of group B and 18% of group C patients.RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival rates were as follows: group A, 12%; B, 8%; C, 16%. Overall brain failures occurred in 38% of patients in group A, 47% in group B, and 42% in group C. The use of WBRT (group A v groups B plus C) had no apparent impact on survival or on overall brain failure rates. In particular, no improvement in either of these parameters could be demonstrated when group B was compared with group A. Focal failure (defined as failure within the brain adjacent to the site of the resected brain metastases) occurred as follows: group A, 34% (11 of 32); groups B plus C, 23% (25 of 111) (P = .07). WBRT significantly reduced focal failure for patients with adenocarcinoma (group A, 33% [eight of 24]; groups B plus C, 14% [11 of 79]; P = .05). Nonfocal failure (anatomically distinct from the resected metastasis) occurred in 9% of patients in group A (three of 32), 21% in groups B plus C (23 of 111) (P = .07).CONCLUSION: Long-term survival is possible when NSCLC brain metastases are resected. Postoperative WBRT as used in this series only had an impact on the focal control of brain metastases and this effect was of borderline significance. The lack of conclusive benefit supports the need for ongoing randomized trials to test the value of adjuvant postoperative WBRT. Brain failures were relatively common in all three groups of patients, which suggests that doses greater than 30 Gy need to be studied.",Included,0.8945898

186,"Single-center experience with glass-based Yttrium 90 embolization in neuroendocrine liver metastases. Purpose: To evaluate glass-based Yttrium 90 (Y90) radioembolization in management of neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Specifically to assess toxicities and short-term imaging response. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective review of all patients who had neuroendocrine metastases to the liver that underwent radioembolization with Y-90 was performed. Electronic patient charts were reviewed to analyze demographics, radiation dosimetry, clinical findings, laboratory data, and imaging findings. Toxicities and side effects reported during the first 3 months of the procedures were identified from clinical notes. Short-term imaging response was assessed using EASL and modified RECIST criteria by reviewing latest imaging study in comparison with pre-treatment studies. Result(s): A total of 48 patients received 88 radioembolizations between December 2009 and May 2011. 34 patients had adequate follow-up. A total of 60 lobar and segmental radioembolizations were performed in 34 patients. There were 18 males and 16 females with a median age of 61 y/o (43 to 80 y/o). The radiation dose ranged from 74.9 Gy to 347.1 Gy with an average of 150.9 Gy. 22 patients (65%) complained of fatigue. 15 (44%) right-sided abdominal pain and 8 (24%) noted weight loss ranging from 3.5 kg to 11kg. Seven (21%) patients had nausea, but none experienced vomiting. There was no mortality. Response assessment was made per each lobe/ segment treated and average duration for follow-up was 8 months. There were 82.0 % partial response, 10.3 % stable disease, and 7.7 % progression.

187,"Image guided focused ultrasound: Development of a comprehensive treatment planning, monitoring and control, and assessment. Background/introduction: MRgFUS offers unambiguous advantages over other current treatment modalities, as it is noninvasive and does not use ionizing radiation. Further, ultrasonically-controlled stable and inertial microbubble oscillations exert forces that can, among others, activate cell's mechanoreceptors, disrupt cellular and vascular membranes, accelerate the dissolution of blood clots, enhance thermal ablation, and induce localized tissue erosionetc. FUS can also be used transcranially for tumor ablation, blood-brain barrier disruption, neuromodulation, etc. Harnessing and, potentially, combining these abilities holds great promise for therapy and diagnosis of cancer and cardiovascular and central nervous system diseases and disorders. For the wide-spread use of these approaches, development of methods and technology to enable precise planning, monitoring and control, and assessment of their outcome are essential. Method(s): We developed a novel noninvasive and clinically relevant framework (Fig. 1) that combines i) multimodality imaging (US/MR/CT), ii) 3D Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) numerical simulations, and iii) an integrated MR and US imaging FUS system for guiding FUS therapy. The proposed framework enables accurate treatment planning, via visualization of anatomic structures (MRI), extraction of their acoustic properties (CT) and simulation of US propagation (3D FDTD), which includes realistic microbubble acoustic emissions. The co-registration of CT (skull) with the MR and US datasets allowed us to model and study the microbubble emissions propagation through the skull and refine a standard PAM back-projection algorithm to account for spatially varying wave propagation effects, such as refraction and diffraction. The key component of our framework is the MR and US imaging guided FUS system that is used to monitor and control both the thermal and mechanical effects of FUS transcranially, here using manual and simple on-off controllers. Finally, using MR contrast agent as drug surrogate, the proposed framework is used to assess drug uptake after FUS-BBB disruption. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): The incorporation of a variable speed of sound to the PAM back-projection algorithm corrected the aberrations introduced by the skull (NHP and Human). Further, more than 94% agreement in the FWHM of the axial and transverse line profiles between the simulations incorporating microbubble emissions and experimentally-determined PAMs was observed in NHP. The acoustic emissions monitoring allowed to fine-tune the sonication power for efficacious FUS-BBB disruption in glioma-bearing rat, while, MR temperature imaging based FUS controller allowed to attain constant focal temperature (temperature rise: 7+/-1.5degreeC, for 5 mins) in the brain of a healthy rat. These abilities that have not been previously shown provide a clinically relevant framework for guiding FUS in the brain. We envision that the proposed framework will be essential for developing, optimizing, and translating current and new therapeutic FUS approaches to the clinics.",Excluded,0.103463225
188,"Radiation-induced brain injury. [Japanese]. Radiation-induced brain injury is a life-threatening or at least QOL-compromising pathological entity induced by therapeutic irradiation to malignant brain tumors. Although life-threatening late delayed radiation necrosis and radiation-induced leukoencephalopathy had been assumed to be major complications of radiation therapy to the brain classically, these complications seem to be less frequently seen in therapeutic irradiation to the brain recently because in many treatment protocols to brain tumors, irradiation field is now confined to tumors and their margins and adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of methothrexate etc. has been avoided as much as possible. Instead, less aggressive but still QOL-compromising encephalopathy has been recognized for the past 20 years. This encephalopathy occurs in senior adults several months after the extended field irradiation with even less amount of irradiation dose such as 40 Gy whole brain irradiation. This encephalopathy is characterized by cognitive impairment and brain atrophy which attenuates QOL of the patients. In this article, these radiation-induced brain injuries are reviewed clinically, etiologically and hisotopathologically based on reports in the literature.",Excluded,0.13725792

190,"Multivariate analysis of factors affecting brainstem integral dose in stereotactic-treated patients. The dose contributed to the brainstem (B.S.) in stereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy (SRS/SRT) is an essential part of treatment plan evaluation. Yet, there is a lack of a stratifying schema for the lesions near the brain stem, based on doses and volume irradiated. We investigated the possible determining factors affecting brain stem integral dose (BSID). Material(s) and Method(s): Treatment plans of 141 patients treated by SRS or SRT were reviewed selection for this analysis was based upon lesions within 4 cm radius from the center of brain stem in all directions. Thirty-two patients were eligible. Out of 32 patients, 2 were treated with SRS and 6 with SRT. Lesions were stratified into five groups according to P-P distance (periphery of lesion to periphery of brain stem): group I (-1.5-0 cm) constituted lesions overlapping or interfacing brain stem; group II (0.1-0.9 cm); group III (1-1.9 cm); group IV (2-2.9 cm); group V (3-4 cm). Conformity index (PITV) volume of brain stem receiving the mean dose and BSID were calculated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to correlate BSID with its determinants, namely PITV, P-P distance, C-P distance (center of lesion to periphery of brain stem), and mean collimator size. Result(s): The highest mean BSID was observed in group I and the least in group V; 1 patient in group I with BSID of 16.8 Gy/cc developed brain stem injury. In univariate analysis, all the determinant factors for BSID (P-P distance, C-P distance, collimator size, and PITV) were shown to impact its value, but on multivariate analysis only P-P distance was the significant factor (p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): Utilization of the P-P distance as a stratification method for lesions within 4 cm radius from the center of the brain stem is valuable in determining the brain stem integral dose. This schema may suggest that lesions in group I with P-P distance (-1.5-0.0 cm) are better treated with fractionated SRT rather than single-fraction SRS. In addition, plans requiring collimator size 730 mm with PITV > 1.5 should also be considered for fractionated regimens.",Excluded,0.10725094
191,"Differential target dependence in the developing brain: implications for mental retardation. During development of the brain, many neurons exhibit a dependence on other neuronal populations for their survival and differentiation (target dependence). Evidence suggests that some neural pathways are much more dependent on single target neuronal populations for their survival than are others (differential target dependence). This phenomenon has important implications both for animal models of congenital human brain damage and for ideas concerning the aetiology of behavioural abnormalities associated with human mental retardation. Predictions of the neuronal deficits likely to arise from exposure to cytotoxic agents (e.g. ionizing radiation, hyperthermia, viral infection) at a particular time must take differential target dependence into account. It is known that target dependence affects corticopetal pathways involved with the discriminative senses (e.g. vision), more than monoaminergic and cholinergic corticopetal pathways which are believed to be involved with arousal, selective sensory attention, sleep, memory and cortical vasomotor function. Following prenatal damage to superficial layers of the cerebral cortex, this effect of differential target dependence leads not only to a relative hyperinnervation of the cortex with monoaminergic and cholinergic projections, but a specific deficit in visual pathways. The implications of this combined deficit for the behaviour and rehabilitation of the mentally retarded are considered.",Excluded,0.111351654

[11 C] PiB has been used widely as an amyloid imaging agent for brain PET. In recent years, [18 F] flutemetamol has been developed as a new PET amyloid imaging agent. In this study, PET images taken from the same patient using [18 F] flutemetamol and [11 C] PiB were compared so that the amyloid deposition in the brain could be visually and quantitatively evaluated. Method(s): PET was conducted in three patients with amyloid- positive Alzheimer's disease (AD) and one patient with amyloidpositive mild cognitive impairment (MCI), using [18 F] flutemetamol and [11 C] PiB. Ninety minutes after intravenous administration of 185 MBq of [18 F] flutemetamol, dynamic PET imaging was performed for 30 minutes. For [11 C] PiB, dynamic PET imaging was performed for 70 minutes immediately after administration of 350 MBq of [11 C] PiB. The distribution of amyloid deposition in the region of interest in each cortex was quantitatively evaluated using the standard uptake value (SUV) sum images taken in the latter half of the PET session when a higher level of brain amyloid deposition was more readily detectable. The SUV ratio (SUVR) was calculated using the SUV in the cerebellum as the reference value. Moreover, the mean cortical SUVR (MSUVR) was calculated from the SUVR data in the cortex where a high level of amyloid deposition was detected. Result(s): When both [18 F] flutemetamol and [11 C] PiB PET images were evaluated, high levels of amyloid deposition were observed in the frontal lobe, posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG), precuneus, parietal lobe, and lateral temporal lobe. On the other hand, amyloid deposition was only weakly evident in the medial temporal lobe, occipital lobe, and the cerebellar cortex. In [18 F] flutemetamol PET, the MSUVR was 2.32, and the MSUVR in the PCG was 2.68. In [11 C] PiB PET, the MSUVR was 2.04, and the MSUVR in the PCG was 2.26. These data indicate that, although the dose of radioisotope was lower in [18 F] flutemetamol PET, the SUVR in each cortex were generally high in [18 F] flutemetamol PET. Conclusion(s): [18 F] flutemetamol has a longer half-life and can be delivered for a longer duration. The data indicate that, as an amyloid imaging agent, the performance of [18 F] flutemetamol is similar to that of [11 C] PiB in AD and AD-associated MCI.",Excluded,0.10389077

Background: Frameless stereotaxy is an established method for real-time image-guided surgical navigation in neurological surgery. Though this is capable of providing sub-millimeter accuracy, it has not been used by other surgical specialists. Methods and procedure: A patient with locally advanced, distal rectal cancer and tumor abutting the prostate was selected for transanal TME using TAMIS, with intra-operative CT-guided navigation to ensure an R0 resection. Result(s): The use of stereotactic TAMIS-TME was successfully performed with an accuracy of +/-4 mm. The surgical specimen revealed an R0 resection, and this new approach aided in achieving adequate resection margins. Conclusion(s): This is the first report of the use of frameless stereotactic navigation beyond the scope of neurosurgery. Stereotactic navigation for transanal total mesorectal excision is shown to be feasible.

Using a beam energy of 6 MV, two dose levels of 70 and 55.4 Gy were used to treat the tumour. Doses of 2 Gy in 35 fractions and 1.68 Gy in 33 fractions were simultaneously delivered for effective planning target volume (PTV1) and boost planning target volume (PTV2), respectively.Results Dose distribution in PTV and critical organs lies within tolerance dose guidelines protecting spinal cord, brain stem, optic chiasm, optic nerve, thus reducing the risk of damage to normal tissues. Minor deviation from tolerance limit was observed for parotid glands. This technique provided highly conformal and homogenous dose distribution as well as better sparing of OARs, hence verifying quality assurance results to be satisfactory.Findings SIB IMRT technique offers best solution for preserving organ function by keeping dose below tolerance level.

PURPOSE: Recent randomized trials of selected patients with single brain metastasis comparing resection followed by whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) to WBRT alone have shown a statistically significant survival advantage for surgery and WBRT. A multiinstitutional retrospective study was performed, which identified comparable patients who were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (RS) and WBRT.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The RS databases of four institutions were reviewed to identify patients who met the following criteria: single-brain metastasis; no prior cranial surgery or WBRT; age > 18 years; surgically resectable lesion; Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) > or = 70 at time of RS; nonradiosensitive histology. One hundred twenty-two patients were identified who met these criteria. Patients were categorized by: (a) status of the primary, (b) status of non-CNS metastasis, (c) age, (d) baseline KPS (from 70-100), (e) histology, (f) time from diagnosis of primary to the detection of the brain metastasis, (g) gender, and (h) tumor volume. RS was performed with a linear accelerator based technique (peripheral dose range was 10-27 Gy, median was 17 Gy). WBRT was performed in all but five patients who refused WBRT (dose range was 25-40 Gy, median was 37.5 Gy).RESULTS: The median follow-up for all patients was 123 weeks. The overall local control rate (defined as lack of progression in the RS volume) was 86%. Intracranial recurrence outside of the RS volume was seen in 27 patients (22%). The actuarial median survival from date of RS is 56 weeks, and the 1-year and 2-year actuarial survival rates are 53% and 30%. The median duration of functional independence (sustained KPS > or = 70) is 44 weeks. Nineteen of 77 deaths were attributed to CNS progression (25% of all deaths). Multivariate analysis revealed the following factors to be statistically significant predictors of survival: baseline KPS (p < .0001) and absence of other sites of metastasis (p = 0.008).CONCLUSION: The RS in conjunction with WBRT for single brain metastasis can produce substantial functional survival, especially in patients with good performance status and without extracranial metastasis. These results are comparable to recent randomized trials of resection and WBRT. The advantages of RS over surgery in terms of cost, hospitalization, morbidity, and wider applicability strongly suggest that a randomized trial to compare RS with surgery is warranted.",Excluded,0.5799259

BACKGROUND: Currently available information about patients with posterior uveal melanoma treated by plaque radiotherapy is insufficient to determine what to do about eyes that become blind as a consequence of the tumour and its treatment. Should they be enucleated, or is ocular preservation just as good in terms of survival?METHODS: We performed a retrospective survival analysis of secondary enucleation versus ocular preservation in patients with a posterior uveal melanoma treated by plaque radiotherapy whose irradiated eye became completely blind following that treatment. Of the 79 patients who fulfilled defined inclusion criteria, 25 underwent secondary enucleation of the blind eye, and 54 retained their irradiated blind eye.RESULTS: Most of the baseline demographic and tumour-related variables evaluated were similarly distributed between the subgroups. The 5-year, 10-year and 15-year all-cause death rates in the secondary enucleation subgroup were 24.7%, 51.5% and 52.0% respectively, and those in the ocular preservation subgroup were 7.4%, 32.9% and 48.1% respectively. In spite of the apparent slight difference between the curves, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.41, Mantel-Haenszel test).INTERPRETATION: Although a retrospective study of this type has several limitations, our results suggest that secondary enucleation is not likely to substantially improve survival of patients whose irradiated eye becomes totally blind following plaque radiotherapy for choroidal or ciliochoroidal melanoma.",Excluded,0.85898626

Signaling through TrkA kinase domains promotes neuronal survival, whereas activation of the p75(NTR) ""death domains"" induces apoptosis under correct physiological conditions.

The MC neurons were necessary for normal stimulation of pumping in response to food, but pumping continued and was functional in MC- worms. The remaining 12 neuron types were also unnecessary for functional pumping. No operation we did, including destruction of the entire pharyngeal nervous system, abolished pumping altogether. When we killed all pharyngeal neurons except M4, the worms were viable and fertile, although retarded and starved.

207,"Differential responses to NMDA receptor activation in rat hippocampal interneurons and pyramidal cells may underlie enhanced pyramidal cell vulnerability. Hippocampal interneurons are generally more resistant than pyramidal cells to excitotoxic insults. Because NMDA receptors play a crucial role in neurodegeneration, we have compared the response to exogenous NMDA in CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons of the stratum oriens using combined whole-cell patch-clamp recording and ratiometric Ca2+ imaging. In voltage-clamp, current-clamp or in nominally Mg2+-free medium, NMDA (10 microM; 3-5 min exposure in the presence of tetrodotoxin) induced a markedly larger inward current and Ca2+ rise in pyramidal cells than in interneurons. Pyramidal cells also showed a more pronounced voltage dependence in their response to NMDA. We hypothesized that this enhanced response to NMDA receptor activation in pyramidal cells could underlie their increased vulnerability to excitotoxicity. Using loss of dye as an indicator of degenerative membrane disruption, interneurons tolerated continuous exposure to a high concentration of NMDA (30 microM) for longer periods than pyramidal cells. This acute neurodegeneration in pyramidal cells was independent of intracellular Ca2+, because high intracellular BAPTA (20 mM) did not prolong survival time. Thus, a plausible explanation for the enhanced sensitivity of pyramidal neurons to excitotoxic insults associated with cerebral ischemia is their greater response to NMDA receptor activation, which may reflect differences in NMDA receptor expression and/or subunit composition.",Excluded,0.102915816

Neutron capture therapy in the treatment of brain tumors is a procedure consisting of localization within the tumor of a suitable nuclide having high thermal neutron cross section. When the tumor is irradiated by thermal neutrons which selectively interact with the localized nuclide, the ionizing radiation resulting from the reaction dissipates its energy within the tumor and destroys it, leaving normal tissue relatively unharmed. Ten minutes post injection of Boron 10 differential concentration between tumor and normal brain tissue was obtained as reported by Farr (1951). The differential concentration was found to be 3.3:1. In the present work a simulated tumor contained <sup>10</sup>B in a concentration of 50 mug/g tissue and the brain tissue bulk that fills up the skull in a concentration of 15 mug/g tissue. The dose imparted to the tumors was nearly 2.6 times that imparted to the ordinary brain tissue. The tumor was located first between 1-3.5 cm from the skull surface; secondly, it was located between 3.6-6 cm from skull surface. In each case it was observed that there was a sharp fall of neutron flux where the tumor was fixed. Such a sharp fall of neutron flux is anticipated due to the high boron content in the tumor. Gold foils were used as detectors for measuring neutron flux; after exposure in the neutron beam for some time the activity of <sup>198</sup>Au was measured on a Geiger Muller counter.",Excluded,0.10387686
210,"Long-term cognitive profile and incidence of dementia after STN-DBS in Parkinson's disease. An effect of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) on cognition has been suspected but long-term observations are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term cognitive profile and the incidence of dementia in a cohort of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients treated by STN-DBS. 57 consecutive patients were prospectively assessed by the mean of a neuropsychological battery over 3 years after surgery. Dementia (DSM-IV) and UPDRS I to IV were recorded. 24.5% of patients converted to dementia over 3 years (incidence of 89 of 1,000 per year). This group of patients cognitively continuously worsened over 3 years up to fulfilling dementia criteria (PDD). The rest of the cohort remained cognitively stable (PD) over the whole follow-up. Preoperative differences between PDD and PD included older age (69.2 +/- 5.8 years; 62.6 +/- 8 years), presence of hallucinations and poorer executive score (10.1 +/- 5.9; 5.5 +/- 4.4). The incidence of dementia over 3 years after STN-DBS is similar to the one reported in medically treated patients. The PDD presented preoperative risk factors of developing dementia similar to those described in medically treated patients. These observations suggest dementia being secondary to the natural evolution of PD rather than a direct effect of STN-DBS.",Excluded,0.10846537
211,"Magnetic fields alter electrical properties of solutions and their physiological effects. Calcium chloride and snail physiological salt solutions were exposed to static magnetic fields (2.3-350 mT), and the physical properties of the solutions as well as their biologic effects were studied. Our preliminary observations show that these fields alter physicochemical properties of CaCl2 solutions and the functional effects of physiological solutions. Experiments on CaCl2 solutions demonstrated field-dependent changes of electrical conductivity, with the magnitude and the direction of conductivity change being a function of both concentration and field intensity. The changes in conductivity were maintained for periods in excess of 1 h after exposure. Conductivity changes were not found after exposure of physiological solutions to static magnetic fields, but changes of biological consequence did occur. Other experiments showed that there were several changes in cellular function observed in ganglia and isolated neurons of Helix pomatia when the perfusing medium was changed from the normal physiologic solution to the same solution after exposure to magnetic fields. These changes include membrane depolarization and increased action potential discharge, reduced uptake of Ca into cells, altered content of cyclic nucleotides in ganglia, and increased volume of isolated cell bodies. A change in hydration of calcium ions may be one of the consequences of magnetic-field exposure, and in physiological solutions this change may have functional consequences.",Excluded,0.10498612
212,"Activation of C-fiber nociceptors by low-power diode laser. OBJECTIVE: The evaluation of selective activation of C-fibers to record evoked potentials using the association of low-power diode laser (810 nm), tiny-area stimulation and skin-blackening.METHOD: Laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) were obtained from 20 healthy young subjects. An aluminum plate with one thin hole was attached to the laser probe to provide tiny-area stimulation of the hand dorsum and the stimulated area was covered with black ink.RESULTS: The mean intensity used for eliciting the ultra-late laser-evoked potential (ULEP) was 70 +/- 32 mW. All subjects showed a clear biphasic potential that comprised a negative peak (806 +/- 61 ms) and a positive deflection (1033 +/- 60 ms), corresponding to the ULEP related to C-fiber activation.CONCLUSION: C-fiber-evoked responses can be obtained using a very low-power diode laser when stimulation is applied to tiny areas of darkened skin.

213,"Extraction of optical properties and prediction of light distribution in rat brain tissue. Predicting the distribution of light inside any turbid media, such as biological tissue, requires detailed information about the optical properties of the medium, including the absorption and scattering coefficients and the anisotropy factor. Particularly, in biophotonic applications where photons directly interact with the tissue, this information translates to system design optimization, precision in light delivery, and minimization of unintended consequences, such as phototoxicity or photobleaching. In recent years, optogenetics has opened up a new area in deep brain stimulation with light and the method is widely adapted by researchers for the study of the brain circuitries and the dynamics of neurological disorders. A key factor for a successful optogenetic stimulation is delivering an adequate amount of light to the targeted brain objects. The adequate amount of light needed to stimulate each brain object is identified by the tissue optical properties as well as the type of opsin expressed in the tissue, wavelength of the light, and the physical dimensions of the targeted area. Therefore, to implement a precise light delivery system for optogenetics, detailed information about the optical properties of the brain tissue and a mathematical model that incorporates all determining factors is needed to find a good estimation of light distribution in the brain. In general, three measurements are required to obtain the optical properties of any tissue, namely diffuse transmitted light, diffuse reflected light, and transmitted ballistic beam. In this report, these parameters were measured in vitro using intact rat brain slices of 500 mum thickness via a two-integrating spheres optical setup. Then, an inverse adding doubling method was used to extract the optical properties of the tissue from the collected data. These experiments were repeated to cover the whole brain tissue with high spatial resolution for the three different cuts (transverse, sagittal, and coronal) and three different wavelengths (405, 532, and 635 nm) in the visible range of the spectrum. A three-dimensional atlas of the rat brain optical properties was constructed based on the experimental measurements. This database was linked to a Monte Carlo toolbox to simulate light distribution in the tissue for different light source configurations.",Excluded,0.103415735
214,"Comparison of 32P therapy and sequential hemibody irradiation (HBI) for bony metastases as methods of whole body irradiation. We report a retrospective study of 15 patients with prostate carcinoma and diffuse bone metastases treated with sodium 32P for palliation of pain at Downstate Medical Center and Kings County Hospital from 1973 to 1978. The response rates, duration of response, and toxicities are compared with those of other series of patients treated with 32P and with sequential hemibody irradiation. The response rates and duration of response are similar with both modalities ranging from 58 to 95% with a duration of 3.3 to 6 months with 32P and from 75 to 86% with a median duration of 5.5 months with hemibody irradiation. There are significant differences in the patterns of response and in the toxicities of the two treatment methods. Both methods cause significant bone marrow depression. Acute radiation syndrome, radiation pneumonitis, and alopecia are seen with sequential hemibody irradiation and not with 32P, but their incidence can be reduced by careful treatment planning. Hemibody irradiation can provide pain relief within 24 to 48 h, while 32P may produce an initial exacerbation of pain. Lower hemibody irradiation alone is less toxic than either upper hemibody irradiation or 32P treatment.",Excluded,0.22827059
215,"Cerebrovascular diseases incidence and mortality in an extended Mayak Worker Cohort 1948-1982. Incidence and mortality from cerebrovascular disease (CVD) [International Classification of Diseases 9th revision (ICD-9) codes: 430-438] was studied in a cohort of 22,377 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association (Mayak PA) in 1948-1982 and followed up to the end of 2008. The cohort size was increased by 19% and follow-up extended by 3 years over the previous analysis. Radiation doses were estimated using an updated dosimetry system: Mayak Worker Dosimetry System 2008 (MWDS-2008). For the first time, in an analysis of this cohort, quantitative smoking data were used. Workers of the study cohort were exposed occupationally to prolonged external gamma rays and internal alpha particles. The mean (+/-standard deviation) total dose from external gamma rays was 0.54 +/- 0.76 Gy (95% percentile 2.21 Gy) for males and 0.44 +/- 0.65 Gy (95% percentile 1.87 Gy) for females. The mean plutonium body burden in the 31% of workers monitored for internal exposure was 1.32 +/- 4.87 kBq (95% percentile 4.71 kBq) for males and 2.21 +/- 13.24 kBq (95% percentile 4.56 kBq) for females. The mean total absorbed alpha-particles dose to the liver from incorporated plutonium was 0.23 +/- 0.77 Gy (95% percentile 0.89 Gy) in males and 0.44 +/- 2.11 Gy (95% percentile 1.25 Gy) in females. After adjusting for nonradiation factors (gender, age, calendar period, employment period, facility, smoking, alcohol consumption), there were significantly increasing trends in CVD incidence associated with total absorbed dose from external gamma rays and total absorbed dose to the liver from internal alpha-particle radiation exposure. Excess relative risks per Gy (ERR/Gy) were 0.46 (95% CI 0.37, 0.57) and 0.28 (95% CI 0.16, 0.42), respectively, based on a linear dose-response model. Adjustments for additional factors (hypertension, body mass index, duration of employment, smoking index and total absorbed dose to the liver from internal exposure during the analysis of external exposure and vice versa) had little effect on the results. The categorical analyses showed that CVD incidence was significantly higher among workers with total absorbed external gamma-ray doses greater than 0.1 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses and that CVD incidence was also significantly higher among workers with total absorbed internal alpha-particle doses to the liver from incorporated plutonium greater than 0.01 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses. The results of the categorical analyses of CVD incidence were in good agreement with a linear dose response for external gamma-ray doses but for internal alpha-particle doses the picture was less clear. For the first time an excess risk of CVD mortality was seen in workers whose livers were exposed to internal alpha-particle doses greater than 0.1 Gy compared to those workers who were exposed to doses of less than 0.01 Gy. A significant increasing trend for CVD mortality with internal alpha-particle dose was revealed in the subcohort of workers exposed at doses <1.0 Gy after having adjusted for nonradiation factors, ERR/Gy = 0.84 (95% CI, 0.09, 1.92). These updated results provide good evidence for a linear trend in risk of CVD incidence with external gamma-ray dose. The trend for CVD incidence with internal alpha-particle dose is less clear due to the impact of issues concerning the use of dose estimates based on below the limit of detection bioassay measurements.",Included,0.9224448
216,"Multiwavelength optical intrinsic signal imaging of cortical spreading depression. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is an important disease model for migraine and cerebral ischemia. In this study, we exploit the high temporal and spatial resolution of optical imaging to characterize perfusion-dependent and -independent changes in response to CSD and to investigate the etiology of reflectance changes during CSD. In this experiment, we characterized the optical response to CSD at wavelengths that emphasize perfusion-related changes (610 and 550 nm), and we compared these results with 850 nm and blood volume data. Blood volume changes during CSD were recorded using an intravascular fluorescent dye, Texas Red dextran. We observed triphasic optical signals at 850 and 550 nm characterized by spreading waves of increased, decreased, then increased reflectance (Fig. 1) which expanded at a rate of approximately 3-5 mm/min. The signal at 610 nm had a similar initial phase, but the phase 2 response was slightly more complex, with a parenchymal decrease in reflectance but a vascular increase in reflectance. Reflectance values decreased in phase three. Blood volume signals were delayed relative to the optical intrinsic signals and corresponded temporally to phases 2 and 3. This is the first study to characterize optical imaging of intrinsic signal responses to CSD, in vivo, at multiple wavelengths. The data presented here suggest that changes in light scattering precede perfusion responses, the blood volume increase (phase 2) is accompanied by a reduction in deoxyhemoglobin, and the blood volume decrease (phase 3) is accompanied by an increase in deoxyhemoglobin. Previous studies have suggested the oligemia of spreading depression was a result of decreased metabolic demand. This study suggests that during the oligemic period there is a greater reduction in oxygen delivery than in demand.",Excluded,0.10306302
217,"Blink reflexes in patients with atypical odontalgia and matched healthy controls. Atypical odontalgia (AO) is an orofacial pain condition which has been suggested to involve neuropathic pain mechanisms. The aim of this study was to use a brain stem reflex to investigate craniofacial nociceptive mechanisms in AO. In 38 AO patients and 27 matched healthy controls, the R2 component of the blink reflex (BR) was elicited using a ""nociceptive-specific"" electrode and recorded with surface electromyography electrodes on both orbicularis oculi muscles. The BR was tested by stimulation of both sides of the face of the participants before, during, and after an intraoral pain provocation test with capsaicin. The data were analyzed with three- and four-way mixed-model analyses of variance. The root mean square value of the ipsilateral R2 (R2i) was significantly reduced in patients compared with controls (P=0.046). No differences in R2 between stimulation sides were detected in either group (P>0.757). In all participants, R2 responses and the intensity of the pain evoked by the electrical stimulus were decreased during and after application of capsaicin compared with baseline (P<0.001). In patients, R2i onset latencies were significantly prolonged compared with controls (P=0.031). The present data show disturbances in the central processing of craniofacial information and that endogenous pain inhibitory systems in AO patients and healthy controls were activated to a similar degree by an acute intraoral nociceptive input. Additional clinical research with AO patients will be needed to determine to what extent neuropathic pain mechanisms are involved in this pain condition.",Excluded,0.103401415
218,"Choroideremia: melanopsin-mediated postillumination pupil relaxation is abnormally slow. PURPOSE: To investigate the rod-cone and melanopsin pupillary light response (PLR) pathways in choroideremia.METHODS: Eight patients with choroideremia and 18 healthy age-matched controls underwent chromatic pupillometry by applying blue (463 nm) and red light (643 nm) at 100 lux intensity to the right eye while recording pupil diameters. Absolute baseline pupil size (mm), normalized maximal pupil constriction and the early and late postillumination pupillary dilation, from 0 to 10 seconds and 10 to 30 seconds after the end of illumination, respectively, were determined. Postillumination responses to blue light were considered to be primarily driven by melanopsin activation of the intrinsic photosensitive retinal ganglion cells.RESULTS: Baseline pupil diameters were comparable in patients with choroideremia and control subjects (p = 0.48). The maximum pupil constriction in patients with choroideremia was severely weakened in red light but only mildly weakened in blue light (p < 0.05). Postillumination dilation of the pupil was normal after red illumination but extremely protracted after blue illumination. Also, in contrast to healthy subjects, no abrupt change in the dilation curve was seen in the patients after the end of blue illumination, the early-phase dilation being completely abolished (p < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Rod-cone-driven pupil responses were decreased as expected in an outer retinal degeneration, and near-normal pupil constriction in blue light supports that the melanopsin system is normal. In contrast, the lack of brisk early-phase dilation after blue illumination in choroideremia is remarkable and may be interpreted to mean that the absence of photoreceptor inhibition promotes a tonic contraction of the pupil.",Excluded,0.10498699
219,"Pupillometric evaluation of the melanopsin containing retinal ganglion cells in mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial optic neuropathies. In recent years, chromatic pupillometry is used in humans to evaluate the activity of melanopsin expressing intrinsic photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Blue light is used to stimulate the ipRGCs and red light activates the rod/cone photoreceptors. The late re-dilation phase of pupillary light reflex is primarily driven by the ipRGCs. Optic neuropathies i.e. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA), nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), glaucoma, optic neuritis and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) are among the diseases, which have been subject to pupillometric studies. The ipRGCs are differentially affected in these various optic neuropathies. In mitochondrial optic neuropathies, the ipRGCs are protected against degeneration, whereas in glaucoma, NAION, optic neuritis and IIH the ipRGCs are damaged. Here, we will review the results of pupillometric, histopathological and animal studies evaluating the ipRGCs in mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial optic neuropathies.",Excluded,0.10368608
220,"Fatty fish intake decrease multiple sclerosis risk among people exposed to low levels of ultraviolet radiation. Background: The aim of this study was to estimate the relationship between intake of fatty fish and risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). Method(s): This study is based on the ongoing project Epidemiological Investigation of MS (EIMS) which is a population-based case-control study, comprising the general population aged 16-70 years in defined areas of Sweden. The present analysis involved 1404 incident cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) and 3097 controls, randomly selected from the study base, with consideration taken to age, gender, and residential area. The incidence of MS among people who reported high intake of fatty fish the last five years before inclusion in the study was compared with the incidence among people who reported low fatty fish intake. Adjustments were made for education level, smoking status, ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure habits, body mass index (BMI), vitamin D intake from dairy products and intake of lean fish. We performed sub group analyses stratifying for sun exposure habits, ancestry and gender. Finding(s): Subjects who reported fatty fish intake 1-7 times per week had a slightly decreased risk of multiple sclerosis compared with subjects who reported less intake of fatty fish (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-1.1). In subgroup analyses among subjects who reported low UVR exposure, frequent fatty fish intake significantly decreased the risk of multiple sclerosis (adjusted OR 0.6 (95 CI 0.5-0.9), whereas among subjects who reported high UVR exposure, this was not seen (adjusted OR 1.1 95% CI 0.8-1.4). Interpretation(s): Fatty fish intake seems to decrease multiple sclerosis risk among people with low UVR light exposure. A hypothetical explanation is that intake of fatty fish, with relatively high vitamin D content, is a substitute for lack of vitamin D due to low UVR exposure. This gives further strength to the hypothesis of the importance of vitamin D for the development of multiple sclerosis.

Background An unusual presentation of endometrial cancer with infection by Trueperella bernardiae. Case A 70-year-old female with a significant history of weight loss and abdominal pain presented as an emergency with a peritonitic abdomen. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large uterine mass and pneumoperitoneum. Subsequent laparotomy found an enlarged uterus with necrosis and purulent exudate with no evidence of bowel perforation. This required a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Microscopy and culture of the peritoneal fluid produced a heavy growth of Clostridium ramosum and Trueperella bernardiae. Sensitivities included pip/tazobactam, clindamycin, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. Histology showed an extensively necrotic Stage 3A Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. This patient was septic on admission and suffered an acute kidney injury. Following recovery from surgery, treatment under the gynaecological oncology team will include chemotherapy, externalbeam radiation and brachytherapy. Conclusion This case is unusual as the initial clinical presentation suggested bowel perforation. This patient also suffered an unusual infection with Clostridium ramosum and Trueperella bernardiae, the latter is a very uncommon isolation. The CT scan showed a pneumoperitoneum which led to the suspicion of bowel perforation. At subsequent laparotomy, no evidence of bowel perforation was noted. The findings of pneumoperitoneum could be explained by culture findings of Clostridium ramosum resulting in a gas forming infection within the necrotic uterine mass. There are very few published case reports describing the clinical manifestations of Trueperella bernardiae, a facultative anaerobic gram-positive coccobacilli. Trueperella bernardiae can be a part of the regular skin flora however it has been the reported pathogen in cases of urinary tract infections, septic arthritis, diabetic foot infection, soft tissue infection, brain abscess and eye infections.

222,"Does radiation exposure portend worse postoperative outcomes after cystectomy with urinary diversion for benign indications?. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Preoperative radiation exposure is traditionally thought to correlate with increased postoperative complications after cystectomy with urinary diversion (CxUD) for benign indications. We assessed postoperative outcomes among patients who received CxUD, stratified by radiation exposure. METHOD(S): A retrospective review of patients undergoing CxUD over a 10 year period encompassed demographics, operative parameters, 30 and 90 day readmission and complications. CxUD for malignant indications and in patients below 18 years of age were excluded. Chi-square and t-test analyses assessed demographics and indications. Complications were measured by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULT(S): Among 103 patients, 39 (38%) had radiation exposure prior to CxUD. Mean age for patients with radiation exposure undergoing cystectomy and urinary diversion was significantly higher (69.8 vs 59.7 years, p=0.001). In patients receiving preoperative radiation, 23.1% (9/39) had congestive heart failure (p=0.005). Other preexisting conditions such as diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, renal disease and liver disease were not associated with radiation exposure. Operative time (p=0.861), estimated blood loss (p=0.756) and length of stay (p=0.776) were not associated with radiation exposure. There was a significant correlation between radiation exposure and having a preoperative diagnosis of genitourinary fistulae (p=0.001), neurogenic bladder (p<0.0001) and urethral stricture (p=0.002). Radiation exposure did not correlate to readmission at 30 days (p=0.256) or at 90 days (p=0.576). Ureteroileal strictures requiring interventional radiology procedures were observed in 6 patients (5.8%) and stomal stenosis was seen in 2 patients (1.9%). Neither variable was correlated with radiation exposure (p=0.27 and p=0.265, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): In spite of patients being older with more comorbidities at baseline, patients with preoperative radiation exposure undergoing CxUD for benign indications did not have increased readmission at 30 or 90 days or increased complications postoperatively. Additionally, operative parameters such as surgery time, estimated blood loss and length of stay were similar between radiation and naive patient groups. These findings suggest radiation exposure prior to CxUD may not portend as negative consequences as once thought.",Included,0.89672214

Small cell carcinomas (SCC) are rare neuroendocrine malignancies accounting for approximately 0.2% of all colorectal cancers. Since first described in 1955, approximately 200 cases of rectal SCC have been reported in the literature. The most widely accepted theory regarding development of SCC is divergent differentiation of a pluripotent stem cell precursor. Interestingly, although the gastrointestinal tract (GI) has the largest number of neuroendocrine cells, it is rare for neuroendocrine malignancies to originate there. We present a case of metastatic SCC presenting with chief complaint of dyspnea. A 50 year old female with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department with a 2 day history of dyspnea on exertion. She reported two weeks of abdominal bloating, rectal tenesmus, constipation, and unintentional weight loss. Vital signs were notable for hypertension and tachycardia. Labs were notable for alkaline phosphatase 1717 U/L, total bilirubin 2.4 mg/dL, lipase 501 U/L, D-dimer 7.6 mu g/mL, WBC 23,900 mCL, Hgb 6.9 gm/dL, and MCV 64.6. CEA was 15.9. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed hepatomegaly with numerous liver lesions (largest in the right lobe measuring 9cm), enlarged intra-abdominal lymph nodes and a perirectal region mass extending to the rectosigmoid measuring 7.5x5x3cm. CT PE protocol demonstrated 2 subcentimeter lung nodules in the right middle lobe. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed a mid-rectal mass extending 10cm superiorly. Biopsies revealed small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with squamous differentiation. Chemotherapy was initiated with carboplatin and etoposide. Small cell carcinomas of the GI tract are exceedingly uncommon. It most commonly presents in the 6th decade of life with male predominance. These tumors exhibit highly aggressive behavior and carry a poor prognosis with a median survival of 10.4 months. Immunohistochemistry differentiates SCC from other malignancies, with strongly positive synaptophysin immunoreactivity the most reliable finding. Due to its histological similarity to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and rarity, treatment guidelines are extrapolated from SCLC treatment guidelines and include platinum based chemotherapy, radiation and surgical resection. Unfortunately, our patient expired 8 months later due to metastatic disease.

AIM: The aim of this study is to show the practical use of, and to discuss the rationale for, high-end computed tomography (CT) integrated with intrinsic low-resolution single-photon emission tomography (SPECT).MATERIALS AND METHODS: All examinations performed on three new SPECT/CT systems with diagnostic CT capabilities were recorded retrospectively. The use of CT was classified as low-dose, using the CT with restraint as to the tube current and radiation dose, or diagnostic, with an optimum use of the CT, using CT protocols as used in ordinary radiological practice. The number of low-dose CT was compared with the number of diagnostic CT examinations. The report is based on 436 patient examinations from three hospitals in Norway with recently installed SPECT/CT systems, the time of use varying from 6 months to 2 years. The examinations performed were myocardial perfusion (45%), various tumors (thyroid, parathyroid, neuroendocrine 37%), malignant skeletal disease (12%), brain perfusion (4%), sentinel nodes in breast cancer (1%) and gastrointestinal bleeding (1%).RESULTS: Of the 436 patients, 431 had a low-dose CT for attenuation correction, anatomic localisation and, also for diagnosis, whereas five patients had a diagnostic CT. In these series, as was found in recent literature, the diagnostic potential of the CT was seldom used to its capacity and always in predetermined diagnostic situations.CONCLUSION: There is a low degree of utilization of the diagnostic capabilities of the CT in the SPECT/CT context, for a number of reasons.

The study compared traditional spectral analysis and a new scale-invariant method, the analysis of the length distribution of low-variability periods (LDLVPs), to distinguish between electro-encephalogram (EEG) signals with and without a weak stressor, a low-level modulated microwave field. During the experiment, 23 healthy volunteers were exposed to a microwave (450 MHz) of 7 Hz frequency on-off modulation. The field power density at the scalp was 0.16 mW cm(-2). The experimental protocol consisted of ten cycles of repetitive microwave exposure. Signals from frontal EEG channels FP1 and FP2 were analysed. Smooth power spectrum and length distribution curves of low-variability periods, as well as probability distribution close to normal, confirmed that stationarity of the EEG signal during recordings was achieved. The quantitative measure of LDLVPs provided a significant detection of the effect of the stressor for the six subjects exposed to the microwave field but for none of the sham recordings.

Radiation therapy, which represents one of the mainstays of glioma treatment, is known to increase cell invasion by inducing MMP-2. Thus, inhibition of MMP-2 provides a potential means for improving the efficacy of radiotherapy for malignant glioma.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have tested the ability of a plasmid vector-mediated MMP-2 siRNA (p-MMP-2) to modulate ionizing radiation-induced invasive phenotype in the human glioma cell lines U251 and U87. Cells that were transfected with p-MMP-2 with and without radiation showed a marked reduction of MMP-2 compared to controls and pSV-transfected cells. A significant reduction of proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis of cells transfected with p-MMP-2 and in combination with radiation was observed compared to controls. Western blot analysis revealed that radiation-enhanced levels of VEGF, VEGFR-2, pVEGFR-2, p-FAK, and p-p38 were inhibited with p-MMP-2-transfected cells. TUNEL staining showed that radiation did not induce apoptosis in U87 and U251 cells while a significant increase in TUNEL-positive cells was observed when irradiated cells were simultaneously transfected with p-MMP-2 as compared to controls. Intracranial tumor growth was predominantly inhibited in the animals treated with p-MMP-2 alone or in combination with radiation compared to controls.CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: MMP-2 inhibition, mediated by p-MMP-2 and in combination with radiation, significantly reduced tumor cell migration, invasion, angiogenesis and tumor growth by modulating several important downstream signaling molecules and directing cells towards apoptosis. Taken together, our results demonstrate the efficacy of p-MMP-2 in inhibiting radiation-enhanced tumor invasion and progression and suggest that it may act as a potent adjuvant for radiotherapy in glioma patients.",Excluded,0.9235721

232,"Short-course radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy before total mesorectal excision (TME) versus preoperative chemoradiotherapy, TME, and optional adjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer (RAPIDO): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial. BACKGROUND: Systemic relapses remain a major problem in locally advanced rectal cancer. Using short-course radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy and delayed surgery, the Rectal cancer And Preoperative Induction therapy followed by Dedicated Operation (RAPIDO) trial aimed to reduce distant metastases without compromising locoregional control.METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial, participants were recruited from 54 centres in the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Slovenia, Denmark, Norway, and the USA. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, had a biopsy-proven, newly diagnosed, primary, locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma, which was classified as high risk on pelvic MRI (with at least one of the following criteria: clinical tumour [cT] stage cT4a or cT4b, extramural vascular invasion, clinical nodal [cN] stage cN2, involved mesorectal fascia, or enlarged lateral lymph nodes), were mentally and physically fit for chemotherapy, and could be assessed for staging within 5 weeks before randomisation. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1), using a management system with a randomly varying block design (each block size randomly chosen to contain two to four allocations), stratified by centre, ECOG performance status, cT stage, and cN stage, to either the experimental or standard of care group. All investigators remained masked for the primary endpoint until a prespecified number of events was reached. Patients allocated to the experimental treatment group received short-course radiotherapy (5 x 5 Gy over a maximum of 8 days) followed by six cycles of CAPOX chemotherapy (capecitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> orally twice daily on days 1-14, oxaliplatin 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on day 1, and a chemotherapy-free interval between days 15-21) or nine cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on day 1, leucovorin [folinic acid] 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on days 1 and 2, followed by bolus fluorouracil 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously and fluorouracil 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously for 22 h on days 1 and 2, and a chemotherapy-free interval between days 3-14) followed by total mesorectal excision. Choice of CAPOX or FOLFOX4 was per physician discretion or hospital policy. Patients allocated to the standard of care group received 28 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy up to 50.4 Gy or 25 fractions of 2.0 Gy up to 50.0 Gy (per physician discretion or hospital policy), with concomitant twice-daily oral capecitabine 825 mg/m<sup>2</sup> followed by total mesorectal excision and, if stipulated by hospital policy, adjuvant chemotherapy with eight cycles of CAPOX or 12 cycles of FOLFOX4. The primary endpoint was 3-year disease-related treatment failure, defined as the first occurrence of locoregional failure, distant metastasis, new primary colorectal tumour, or treatment-related death, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed by intention to treat. This study is registered with the EudraCT, 2010-023957-12, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01558921, and is now complete.FINDINGS: Between June 21, 2011, and June 2, 2016, 920 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment, of whom 912 were eligible (462 in the experimental group; 450 in the standard of care group). Median follow-up was 4.6 years (IQR 3.5-5.5). At 3 years after randomisation, the cumulative probability of disease-related treatment failure was 23.7% (95% CI 19.8-27.6) in the experimental group versus 30.4% (26.1-34.6) in the standard of care group (hazard ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.95; p=0.019). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse event during preoperative therapy in both groups was diarrhoea (81 [18%] of 460 patients in the experimental group and 41 [9%] of 441 in the standard of care group) and neurological toxicity during adjuvant chemotherapy in the standard of care group (16 [9%] of 187 patients). Serious adverse events occurred in 177 (38%) of 460 participants in the experimental group and, in the standard of care group, in 87 (34%) of 254 patients without adjuvant chemotherapy and in 64 (34%) of 187 with adjuvant chemotherapy. Treatment-related deaths occurred in four participants in the experimental group (one cardiac arrest, one pulmonary embolism, two infectious complications) and in four participants in the standard of care group (one pulmonary embolism, one neutropenic sepsis, one aspiration, one suicide due to severe depression).INTERPRETATION: The observed decreased probability of disease-related treatment failure in the experimental group is probably indicative of the increased efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy as opposed to adjuvant chemotherapy in this setting. Therefore, the experimental treatment can be considered as a new standard of care in high-risk locally advanced rectal cancer.FUNDING: Dutch Cancer Foundation, Swedish Cancer Society, Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, and Spanish Clinical Research Network.",Excluded,0.16509292
233,"NAD(+) maintenance attenuates light induced photoreceptor degeneration. Light-induced retinal damage (LD) occurs after surgery or sun exposure. We previously showed that zinc (Zn(2+)) accumulated in photoreceptors and RPE cells after LD but prior to cell death, and pyruvate or nicotinamide attenuated the resultant death perhaps by restoring nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) levels. We first examined the levels of NAD(+) and the efficacy of pyruvate or nicotinamide in oxidative toxicities using primary retinal cultures. We next manipulated NAD(+) levels in vivo and tested the affect on LD to photoreceptors and RPE. NAD(+) levels cycle with a 24-h rhythm in mammals, which is affected by the feeding schedule. Therefore, we tested the affect of increasing NAD(+) levels on LD by giving nicotinamide, inverting the feeding schedule, or using transgenic mice which overexpress cytoplasmic nicotinamide mononucleotide adenyl-transferase-1 (cytNMNAT1), an NAD(+) synthetic enzyme. Zn(2+) accumulation was also assessed in culture and in retinal sections. Retinas of light damaged animals were examined by OCT and plastic sectioning, and retinal NAD(+) levels were measured. Day fed, or nicotinamide treated rats showed less NAD(+) loss, and LD compared to night fed rats or untreated rats without changing the Zn(2+) staining pattern. CytNMNAT1 showed less Zn(2+) staining, NAD(+) loss, and cell death after LD. In conclusion, intense light, Zn(2+) and oxidative toxicities caused an increase in Zn(2+), NAD(+) loss, and cell death which were attenuated by NAD(+) restoration. Therefore, NAD(+) levels play a protective role in LD-induced death of photoreceptors and RPE cells.",Excluded,0.10587493

235,"Synaptic and membrane properties of neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus. Studies in intact rats have shown that the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) plays a key role in generating stress-induced physiologic changes, including activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis through direct projections to paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN). However, little is known about the cellular properties of DMH neurons. We employed whole-cell patch-clamp recording techniques to characterize membrane properties and spontaneous post-synaptic currents (PSCs) in DMH neurons, including those projecting to PVN (identified by prior injection of DiI into PVN), in rat hypothalamic slices. DMH neurons (n=86 total) had uniform membrane properties. However, PVN-projecting neurons (n=32) had higher action potential (AP) thresholds, and fired fewer APs in response to current injection. Spontaneous PVN-projecting neurons (n=20) also fired APs at lower rates (4.8+/-0.6 Hz) than spontaneous neurons of unknown projection (n=38; 7.3+/-1.1 Hz). Spontaneous PSCs were observed in all neurons: One population expressed rapid decay characteristics (1.5-2.0 ms) and was blocked by non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists NBQX or CNQX. Remaining PSCs reversed near E(Cl), were blocked by the GABA(A) receptor antagonists picrotoxin or bicuculline methiodide (BMI), and had longer decay time constants (4.5-6.0 ms) that were modulated by pentobarbital. Tetrodotoxin markedly reduced the frequency of PSCs sensitive to NBQX but not to BMI. Thus, DMH is made up of electrophysiologically similar neurons and PVN-projecting neurons are less excitable than neurons of unknown projection. Furthermore, as suggested by studies in intact rats, neurons in the DMH, including those projecting to the PVN, are regulated by tonic GABA(A) and non-NMDA glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic transmission.",Excluded,0.10193541

SOD has allowed significant regression of troubles in two studies with chronic encephalitis and two studies with acute encephalitis. Moreover, another study has shown that SOD prevented cognitival troubles brought on by strong painful stimulus. Thus SOD has been shown able to improve cerebral performances after a specific aggression (after radiotherapy) or after a non specific one (after very painful stimulus).

238,Helical TomoTherapy in the treatment of central nervous system metastasis. In this report the authors review the use of radiotherapy in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis. They comment on different treatment methods for both intracranial and extracranial CNS metastasis and discuss some of the evidence supporting the use of radiotherapy in these settings. Recent advancements in radiation oncology technology are briefly reviewed with a focus on the advantages and disadvantages of helical TomoTherapy-based treatment strategies. A review of pertinent current literature was performed. TomoTherapy research currently underway at the University of Virginia Health System is discussed and a representative case is presented. Radiotherapy for CNS metastasis is an effective treatment that provides palliation of symptoms and confers a survival advantage on selected patients. Advances in radiotherapy techniques continue to improve the therapeutic ratio for patients with CNS metastases. Helical TomoTherapy offers distinct advantages for patients with CNS metastatic disease by sparing normal tissue when intracranial or extracranial disease is targeted.

241,"Alteration of disk-shedding patterns by light-onset of higher than normal intensity. Rod outer segment (ROS) disk-shedding patterns were determined in the albino rat eye. All of the animals had the same, low-intensity-light histories, but on the day that shedding patterns were to be measured the rats were divided into three groups: one which did not have any lights turned on at 0700 hr ('contained dark' group); one which had normal, 3-lx light turned on ('colony' group); one which had a brighter-than-normal light turned on ('80-lx' group). The 'continued dark' group displayed a broad profile of shedding over time which persisted because phagosomes disappeared so slowly. The 'colony' group showed the same initial rate of phagosome production as did the 'continued dark' group but a much accelerated rate of phagosome disappearance. The '80-lx' group showed no rate of phagosome production; rather there was a simple, rapid exponential disappearance of those phagosomes which existed just prior to light onset. The kinetics of these phenomena are described in a model, rate constants for which were obtained from our data and simulated on an analog computer. The analysis of the three shedding patterns indicates the existence of an intensity-dependent disappearance rate and suggests an inhibition of shedding and/or phagocytosis by intensity greater than that of the usual environment.",Excluded,0.10363553
242,"Cerebral blood-flow in nonanesthetized rodents as measured by arterial spinlabeling magnetic-resonance imaging following administration of serotoninergic (5-HT2C) agonists. Changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) have been associated with a number of diseases and conditions including aging, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and the maintenance of neuronal network integrity (1, 2, 3). Objective(s): The current study used arterial spin labelling (ASL) MRI to measure CBF in rodents following administration of 5-HT<inf>2C</inf>selective agonists, vabicaserin and metachlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), in non-anesthetized rodents. ASL measures a biological correlate for neuronal activity by quantitatively estimating CBF with comparable sensitivity to [<sup>15</sup>O]H<inf>2</inf>O positron emission tomography (PET), but uses no ionizing radiation, is non-invasive and not restricted by the necessity of an on-site cyclotron (4). Method(s): Male Sprague Dawley rats (300-350g; n=6-10/ group) were used in the present experiment. MRI data was collected using a Bruker 70/30 Biospec magnet. The ASL protocol included a T1-weighted globally pulsed 3' flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery-echo planar imaging (FAIR-EPI) pulse sequence and a 2mm selectiveinversion pulse with coronal orientation in the middle of the brain parenchyma. A baseline acquisition was followed by additional acquisitions at 10 and 30 minutes post dose (i.p.) with vehicle (0.9% saline 1ml/kg); vabicaserin (30mg/ ml/kg) or mCPP (3mg/ml/kg). Heart and respiration rates were continuously monitored during the scans. ASL data was processed with the Bruker-ParaVision ASL analysis software. Statistical significance was calculated with GraphPad Prism using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison post-test. Telemetry data was collected using Dataquest A.R.T. acquisition and analysis system that allows monitoring physiologic data from conscious, freely moving animals. Result(s): Compared to baseline, both vabicaserin and mCPP caused a significant CBF increase in specific brain regions at 10 minutes following the administration of 5HT2c compounds. At 30 minutes, a CBF increase still trended with both compounds although it was no longer significant. Neither vehicle, vabicaserin, nor mCPP caused a significant change in either heart or respiration rates for the duration of the ASL MRI scan, suggesting that CBF changes could be independent of systemic ones. Further, previous in-house BOLD fMRI following vabicaserin and mCPP administration showed a statistically significant increase in BOLD signal in cortical brain areas, implicit of increased neuronal activity. Previous in-house data with telemeterized rats showed vabicaserin (30mg/kg i.p.) to induce a significant decrease in heart-rate, and a significant increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP), hemodynamic changes that lasted for about 6 h. Conclusion(s): Pre-clinically, ASL-MRI data has translational potential to inform on how various factors such as age, disease or therapeutic intervention can affect CBF. The present study was able to measure CBF with ASL without the use of anesthesia. Administration of 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> agonists increased CBF/brain perfusion and are likely associated with changes neuronal activity. The lack of simultaneous changes on systemic measures, heart and respiration rates, suggest this could be a localized 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> mediated effect. Motion is a major confound in ASL-MRI animal experiments. However, motion reducing anesthetics could have an independent effect on CBF (5), confounding interpretation of the data and reducing their translational potential. Future studies with 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> selective antagonist blockade could be used to gauge the magnitude and selectivity of this effect. (Figure Presented).",Excluded,0.102890596

Background: The feasibility of transradial approach (TRA) for chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not been completely assessed as the majority of operators prefer the femoral route for CTO intervention. Purpose(s): The aim of the current study is to assess technical success, complication rates and procedural efficiency in TRA and transfemoral approach (TFA) in a large prospective European registry adopting the hybrid algorithm for CTO PCI (RECHARGE). Method(s): We analyzed 1253 CTO PCI procedures performed according to the hybrid protocol in 17 European centers, comparing TRA (single or bi-radial access) and TFA (single or bi-femoral or combined radial and femoral access). Result(s): TRA was applied in 306 (24%, 159 unilateral radial, 147 bilateral radial) and TFA in 947 (76%, 126 unilateral femoral, 271 bilateral femoral, 550 combined radial and femoral access) cases. The average J-CTO score was 2.1+/-1.2 in TRA and 2.3+/-1.1 in TFA (p=0.06). Technical success was achieved in 85% in TRA and 86% in TFA (p=0.51). Technical success was similar for TRA and TFA in multivariable analysis. In-hospital major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE) occurred in 2.0% in TRA and 2.9% in TFA (p=0.40). Major access-site bleeding occurred in 0.3% in TRA and 0.5% in TFA (p=0.66).

245,"Investigation of the spinal cord as a natural receptor antenna for incident electromagnetic waves and possible impact on the central nervous system. The effects of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure on biological systems have been studied for many years, both as a source of medical therapy and also for potential health risks. In particular, the mechanisms of EMF absorption in the human or animal body is of medical/engineering interest, and modern modelling techniques, such as the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD), can be utilized to simulate the voltages and currents induced in different parts of the body. The simulation of one particular component, the spinal cord, is the focus of this article, and this study is motivated by the fact that the spinal cord can be modelled as a linear conducting structure, capable of generating a significant amount of voltage from incident EMF. In this article, we show, through a FDTD simulation analysis of an incoming electromagnetic field (EMF), that the spinal cord acts as a natural antenna, with frequency dependent induced electric voltage and current distribution. The multi-frequency (100-2400 MHz) simulation results show that peak voltage and current response is observed in the FM radio range around 100 MHz, with significant strength to potentially cause changes in the CNS.

246,"Palliative radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer. The palliative treatment of patients with NSCLC should be individualized. Treatment decisions should be directed by the goal of maximizing the patient's quality of life, and the patient's wishes should always be ascertained. The approaches to palliative radiation treatment of the chest, bones, and brain are quite similar. Treatment of the chest and bones is usually reserved until symptoms are significant. Brain metastases are generally treated soon after diagnosis. With respect to dose- fractionation schedules, the data are not conclusive. In theory, more protracted schedules of 40 to 50 Gy in 4 to 5 weeks are associated with more durable responses and less long-term morbidity than are shorter and lower- dose schedules. These regimens are therefore worth considering for the most favorable subset of palliative patients (ie, those with good performance status and low burden of disease). At the other end of the spectrum, very ill patients with poor performance status may be best served by short hypofractionated schedules such as 20 Gy in five fractions, 17 Gy in two fractions, or possibly 8 to 10 Gy in one fraction. Response rates with these regimens are good, trips to the treatment facility are minimized, and these ill patients will probably not live long enough to experience the higher long-term toxicity rates associated with larger treatment fractions. The majority of patients, however, fall between these two extremes and are well served by schedules such as 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Radiation treatment fields should not be excessive but cover gross disease with a limited margin. (In the setting of brain metastases, treatment of the whole brain is recommended.)

251,"Evaluating the influence of setup uncertainties on treatment planning for focal liver tumors. PURPOSE: A mechanism has been developed to evaluate the influence of random setup variations on dose during treatment planning. The information available for studying these factors shifts from population-based models toward patient-specific data as treatment progresses and setup measurements for an individual patient become available. This study evaluates the influence of population as well as patient-specific setup distributions on treatment plans for focal liver tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight patients with focal liver tumors were treated on a protocol that involved online setup measurement and adjustment, as well as ventilatory immobilization. Summary statistics from these three-dimensional conformal treatments yielded individual and population distributions of position at initial setup for each fraction. A convolution model for evaluation of the influence of random setup variation on calculated dose distributions has been previously described and investigated for application to focal liver radiotherapy by our department. Individual patient doses based on initial setup positions were calculated by convolving the calculated dose distribution with an anisotropic probability distribution function representing the individual patient's random variations. A separate convolution using population-averaged random variations was performed. Individual beam apertures were then adjusted to provide plans that ensured proper dose to the clinical target volume following convolution with population distributions, as well as individual patient position uncertainty models.RESULTS: Individual patient setup distributions for the course of treatment had random setup variations (sigma) that ranged from 2.5 to 5.7 mm (left-right), 2.1 to 8.3 mm (anterior-posterior), and 4.1 to 10.8 mm (cranial-caudal). The population random components were 4.2 mm (left-right), 4.1 mm (anterior-posterior), and 7.0 mm (cranial-caudal) at initial setup. The initial static planned dose distribution overestimated the volume of liver irradiated to high doses, because inclusion of setup uncertainties generally blurred the resulting doses, shifting the higher-dose region of normal liver dose-volume histograms to lower doses. Furthermore, the population-based dose convolution tended to predict a higher risk of radiation damage to the liver (based on an in-house parameterization of the Lyman normal tissue complication probability model) than the individual patient calculations. For an individual plan, application of different individual random variations yielded change in effective volume differences with a 3% range. Plan adjustment to account for random setup variations generally resulted in a lower change in effective volume than initial planning using a planning target volume followed by calculation of delivered dose based on random offsets.CONCLUSION: This study hints at the factors that most strongly influence planning of liver treatments taking into account geometric variations. Given a setup verification methodology that rapidly reduces systematic offsets, the importance of realistic incorporation of geometric variations as an initial step in treatment planning, as well as possible plan refinement, is demonstrated.",Excluded,0.10227658

REX performed 5 sets x 6-10 repetitions to failure of constant resistance concentric/eccentric plantar flexion every other day during BRU. One-repetition maximum (1RM) strength was tested on the training device. The angle-specific torque-velocity relationship across 5 velocities (0, 0.52, 1.05, 1.75, and 2.97 rad.s-1) and the full range-of-motion power-velocity relationship were assessed on a dynamometer. Torque-position analyses identified strength changes at shortened, neutral, and stretched muscle lengths. Concentric and eccentric contractile work were measured across ten repetitions at 1.05 rad.s-1. Maximal neural activation was measured by surface electromyography (EMG). 1RM decreased 9% in NOE and improved 11% in REX (P < 0.05).

253,"Adenoviral vector-mediated gene transfer: Timing of wild-type p53 gene expression in vivo and effect of tumor transduction on survival in a rat glioma brachytherapy model. Objective. This study sought to investigate modification of the radiation response in a rat 9L brain tumor model in vivo by the wild-type p53 gene (wtp53). Determination of the timing and dose of radiation therapy required the assessment of the duration of the effect of wtp53 expression on 9L tumors after in vivo transfection. Methods. Anesthetized male F-344 rats each were stereotactically inoculated with 4 x 10<sup>4</sup> 9L gliosarcoma cells through a skull screw into the cerebrum in the right frontal region. Twelve-day-old tumors were inoculated through the screw with recombinant adenoviral vectors under isoflurane anaesthesia: control rats with Ad5/RSV/GL2 (carrying the luciferase gene), and study rats with Ad5CMV-p53 (carrying the wtp53 gene). Brain tumors removed at specific times after transfection were measured, homogenized, and lysed and wtp53 expression determined by Western blot analysis. Four groups of nine rats were, subsequently, implanted with iodine-125 seeds 15 days post-tumor inoculation to give a minimum tumor dose of 40 or 60 Gy. Results. We demonstrated transfer of wtp53 into rat 9L tumors in vivo using the Ad5CMV-p53 vector. The expression of wtp53 was demonstrated to be maximum between days 1 and 3 post-vector inoculation. Tumors expressing wtp53 were smaller than controls transfected with Ad5/RSV/GL2 but this difference was not statistically significant. Radiation made a significant difference to the survival of tumor-bearing rats. Moreover, wtp53 expression conferred a significant additional survival advantage. Conclusion. The expression of wtp53 significantly improves the survival of irradiated tumor-bearing rats in our model.",Excluded,0.923554

255,"The effects of a spaceflight analog with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on sensorimotor adaptation. Aboard the International Space Station (ISS), astronauts must adapt to altered vestibular and somatosensory inputs due to microgravity. Sensorimotor adaptation on Earth is often studied with a task that introduces visuomotor conflict. Retention of the adaptation process, known as savings, can be measured when subjects are exposed to the same adaptive task multiple times. It is unclear how adaptation demands found on the ISS might interfere with the ability to adapt to other sensory conflict at the same time. In the present study, we investigated the impact of 30 days' head-down tilt bed rest combined with elevated carbon dioxide (HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>) as a spaceflight analog on sensorimotor adaptation. Eleven subjects used a joystick to move a cursor to targets presented on a computer screen under veridical cursor feedback and 45degree rotated feedback. During this NASA campaign, five individuals presented with optic disk edema, a sign of spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). Thus, we also performed post hoc exploratory analyses between subgroups who did and did not show signs of SANS. HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> had some impact on sensorimotor adaptation, with a lack of savings across the whole group. SANS individuals showed larger, more persistent after-effects, suggesting a shift from relying on cognitive to more implicit processing of adaptive behaviors. Overall, these findings suggest that HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> alters the way in which individuals engage in sensorimotor processing. These findings have important implications for missions and mission training, which require individuals to adapt to altered sensory inputs over long periods in space. <b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This is the first bed rest campaign examining sensorimotor adaptation and savings in response to the combined effect of HDBR + CO2 and to observe signs of spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) in HDBR participants. Our findings suggest that HDBR + CO2 alters the way that individuals engage in sensorimotor processing. Individuals who developed signs of SANS seem to rely more on implicit rather than cognitive processing of adaptive behaviors than subjects who did not present signs of SANS.",Excluded,0.10565244

Dopamine, the major neurotransmitter depleted in Parkinson disease, can be synthesized and regulated in vivo with a combination of intrastriatal AAV-hAADC gene therapy and administration of the dopamine precursor l-Dopa. When tested in MPTP-lesioned monkeys, this approach resulted in long-term improvement in clinical rating scores, significantly lowered l-Dopa requirements, and a reduction in l-Dopa-induced side effects. Positron emission tomography with [(18)F]FMT confirmed persistent AADC activity, demonstrating for the first time that infusion of AAV vector into primate brain results in at least 6 years of transgene expression.

258,"Partial mitochondrial inhibition causes striatal dopamine release suppression and medium spiny neuron depolarization via H2O2 elevation, not ATP depletion. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a potential causal factor in Parkinson's disease. We show here that acute exposure to the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone (30-100 nM; 30 min) causes concentration-dependent suppression of single-pulse evoked dopamine (DA) release monitored in real time with carbon-fiber microelectrodes in guinea pig striatal slices, with no effect on DA content. Suppression of DA release was prevented by the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, implicating ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels; however, tissue ATP was unaltered. Because KATP channels can be activated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as well as by low ATP, we examined the involvement of rotenone-enhanced H2O2 generation. Confirming an essential role for H2O2, the inhibition of DA release by rotenone was prevented by catalase, a peroxide-scavenging enzyme. Striatal H2O2 generation during rotenone exposure was examined in individual medium spiny neurons using fluorescence imaging with dichlorofluorescein (DCF). An increase in intracellular H2O2 levels followed a similar time course to that of DA release suppression and was accompanied by cell membrane depolarization, decreased input resistance, and increased excitability. Extracellular catalase markedly attenuated the increase in DCF fluorescence and prevented rotenone-induced effects on membrane properties; membrane changes were also largely prevented by flufenamic acid, a blocker of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Thus, partial mitochondrial inhibition can cause functional DA denervation via H2O2 and KATP channels, without DA or ATP depletion. Furthermore, amplified H2O2 levels and TRP channel activation in striatal spiny neurons indicate potential sources of damage in these cells. Overall, these novel factors could contribute to parkinsonian motor deficits and neuronal degeneration caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.",Excluded,0.10541296

The present study analyzes the participation of pineal stalk and superior cervical ganglia (SCG) in the conduction of photic evoked potentials (PEP) to the pineal body (PB) in unanesthetized freely moving rats implanted with semimicroelectrodes. The PEPs were recorded in PB, lateral hypothalamus (LH), and habenular complex (HC). In some rats the pineal stalk was lesioned either by electrolysis or by surgical means. Recordings were begun 3 days after electrode implantation; three recording sessions were performed before and after extirpation of SCG or lesion of pineal stalk. The PEPs recorded in LH and HC were characterized by 3 components (positive-negative-positive: PNP). The average latency of the first wave was 35.3 +/- 1.7 and 38.8 +/- 1.6 ms for LH and HC, respectively. The peaks of PEPs in PB showed different polarity (NPN), and the first component had a latency of 36.1 +/- 1.2 ms. The PEPs persisted in all three structures after extirpation of SCG and after electrolytic lesion or transection of the pineal stalk. These results show that the PEPs recorded in PB are not generated in this structure, since they persist after interrupting its connections with the rest of the central nervous system; this suggests that PEPs could be the result of electrotonic transmission from neighboring structures.",Excluded,0.105605595

261,"Distinct response of adult neural stem cells to low versus high dose ionising radiation. Radiosusceptibility is the sensitivity of a biological organism to ionising radiation (IR)-induced carcinogenesis, an outcome of IR exposure relevant following low doses. The tissue response is strongly influenced by the DNA damage response (DDR) activated in stem and progenitor cells. We previously reported that in vivo exposure to 2 Gy X-rays activates apoptosis, proliferation arrest and premature differentiation in neural progenitor cells (transit amplifying cells and neuroblasts) but not in neural stem cells (NSCs) of the largest neurogenic region of the adult brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ). These responses promote adult quiescent NSC (qNSC) activation after 2 Gy. In contrast, neonatal (P5) SVZ neural progenitors continue proliferating and do not activate qNSCs. Significantly, the human and mouse neonatal brain is radiosusceptible. Here, we examine the response of stem and progenitor cells in the SVZ to low IR doses (50-500 mGy). We observe a linear dose-response for apoptosis but, in contrast, proliferation arrest and neuroblast differentiation require a threshold dose of 200 or 500 mGy, respectively. Importantly, qNSCs were not activated at doses below 500 mGy. Thus, full DDR activation in the neural stem cell compartment in vivo necessitates a threshold dose, which can be considered of significance when evaluating IR-induced cancer risk and dose extrapolation.",Included,0.92372245

Thymopentin (10 mg/kg/day/7 days) was injected intraperitoneally in groups of C57BL/6 mice. Then, interleukin-1 alpha was administered on day 7. Twenty hr later, all groups were given whole body sublethal irradiation of 750 rad by 60Co elements. In some groups of mice, treatment with thymopentin was continued for 1 week after irradiation. Efficacy of the combination treatment was assessed by evaluation of mortality, as well as by histologic examination of the brain, testis, bone marrow, heart and spleen. The combination of relatively low doses of interleukin-1 alpha (700 U) with thymopentin yielded a survival which was nearly that observed with interleukin-1 alpha (1000 U) given alone (about 100%). The optimal effect was observed in animals treated for 15 days with thymopentin, either in combination or alone. In addition, incidence and severity of histological lesions were also lower in animals with the some treatment schedule.

The hormonal study including bilateral inferior petrosal sinus catheterization diagnosed a pituitary right lesion, but imagiology was always negative. He underwent a transsphenoidal microadenomectomy and the pathological study showed the presence of corticotrophic hyperplasia but no adenoma. Secondary hypothyroidism and hypogonadism as well as permanent diabetes insipidus were diagnosed and because the patient was not cured he underwent a second transsphenoidal total hypophysectomy.

This syndrome involves a significantly decreased number of simultaneously operating groups of replicons compared to that in normal cells., the rate of fork movement and the fusion of neighbouring units in the group being unchanged. Ionizing radiation (5 Gy) does not change the rate of DNA chain growth in the cells derived from the affected individuals, however, it significantly reduces this parameter in normal cells due to inhibition of replicon initiation in the whole clusters.

INTRODUCTION: Orgasmic pain is an infrequently reported but distressing problem for the patients who experience it. No consensus exists as to its etiology however bladder neck/pelvic floor spasm may play a role. This analysis was conducted to assess the effect of the alpha-blocking medication, tamsulosin on post-orgasmic pain.METHODS: In a prospective, non-placebo controlled study, patients with orgasmic pain were interviewed and administered tamsulosin 0.4 mg po qhs for at least 4 weeks. Outcome measures included libido, pain and continence and these were evaluated using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and an incontinence scale respectively pre and post treatment. Patients were separated into groups based on etiology of the problem (radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, and other) for statistical analysis.RESULTS: 98 patients were enrolled. Pain was located predominantly in the penis (72%), with other sites including testis, rectum and abdomen. Most patients (52%) experienced pain for less than 5 minutes post-orgasm. 76/98 (77%) patients reported significant improvement in pain (>/=2 points on pain VAS) and 12/98 (12%) noted complete resolution of their pain. The VAS for pain reflected a statistically significant decrease in pain for all groups in response to tamsulosin treatment. The entire group had a decrease of 2.7 points between pre and post-treatment phases. The IIEF libido domain increased significantly (mean of 2.4 points) for all treatment groups.CONCLUSION: Tamsulosin decreases orgasmic pain intensity in patients with orgasmic pain.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As late radiotherapy toxicity impacts negatively on the quality-of-life of cancer survivors and is often under reported, a study was set up to prospectively collect patient-reported data in an unselected series of patients with gynaecological malignancy. Aim 1 - To provide 3 year results for the longitudinal study. Aim 2 - To improve the questionnaire used to collect data by identifying redundant items and modifying for use to collect Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) data.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Aim 1 - Patient reported outcome data were collected prospectively by 226 patients before and up to 3 years following radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer using a questionnaire developed to collect LENT subjective data. Aim 2 - A factor analysis was performed to identify which questions gave the most and least information.RESULTS: Aim 1 - Faecal urgency and incontinence (all grades) peaked at 79% and 24%, respectively at 1 year then settled to 69% and 18% at 3 years, respectively. Urinary urgency (all grades) increased with time and was described in 75% at 3 years. Other symptoms reported at 3 years include diarrhoea in 12%, urinary incontinence in 27% and vaginal dryness in 29%. A third of patients did not feel their sex life had changed following treatment, while a quarter felt that it had. Aim 2 - some questions overlapped and others were non-specific.

Pulses of infrared radiation (IR; 1,863 nm, 200 micros, 200-250 Hz for 2-5 s, delivered via an optical fiber) produced a rapid, transient temperature increase of 6-12degreeC (above a baseline of 24-30degreeC).

First, with a razor blade we made an opening in the dorsal cornea to get access to the retina. Thereafter, we inserted a glass electrode through the opening, and penetrated a cell as reported by the recording of a negative potential. Membrane potential was clamped at the photoreceptor's resting potential and a light-pulse was applied to activate currents. Finally, the two light-flash protocol was employed to measure current desensitization and recovery. The first light-flash triggers, after a lag period, the transduction ionic current, which after reaching a peak amplitude decays towards a desensitized state; the second flash, applied at varying time intervals, assesses the state of the light-activated conductance. To characterize the light-elicited current, three parameters were measured: 1) latency (the time elapsed between light flash delivery and the moment in which current achieves 10% of its maximum value); 2) peak current; and 3) desensitization time constant (exponential time constant of the current decay phase). All parameters are affected by the first pulse. To quantify recovery from desensitization, the ratio p2/p1 was employed versus time between pulses. p1 is the peak current evoked by the first light-pulse, and p2 is the peak current evoked by the second pulse.

The ATM protein kinase is a master regulator of the response to double-strand breaks (DSBs), the most cytotoxic DNA lesion caused by ionizing radiation. ATM is the protein missing or inactive in patients with the pleiotropic genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). A major response to DNA damage is altered expression of numerous genes. While studying gene expression in control and A-T cells following treatment with the radiomimetic chemical neocarzinostatin (NCS), we identified an expressed sequence tag that represented a gene that was induced by DSBs in an ATM-dependent manner. The corresponding cDNA encoded a dual specificity phosphatase of the MAP kinase phosphatase family, MKP-5. MKP-5 dephosphorylates and inactivates the stress-activated MAP kinases JNK and p38. The phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of JNK and p38 by NCS was attenuated in A-T cells. Thus, ATM modulates this cycle in response to DSBs.

In remnants of the normal adenohypophysis we revealed immunohistochemical reactivity for growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). In the radiation-induced adenomas, 4 TM were immuno-reactive for TSH, 4 for GH, 2 for PRL, and 2 for FSH. The TM did not react with anti-ACTH and anti-LH (luteinizing hormone) anti-sera.CONCLUSIONS: Obviously, irradiation accelerates the development of pituitary gland adenomas. In this series the TM were predominantly incidental findings at necropsies after pretermed follow-up intervals with a variety of hormone-producing cells. On the other hand, four of nine TM were null adenomas. Necropsies of the brain should be carried out routinely in irradiation studies of the skull.",Included,0.92402726
282,"The hippocampus in aging and disease: From plasticity to vulnerability. The hippocampus has a pivotal role in learning and in the formation and consolidation of memory and is critically involved in the regulation of emotion, fear, anxiety, and stress. Studies of the hippocampus have been central to the study of memory in humans and in recent years, the regional specialization and organization of hippocampal functions have been elucidated in experimental models and in human neurological and psychiatric diseases. The hippocampus has long been considered a classic model for the study of neuroplasticity as many examples of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation and -depression have been identified and demonstrated in hippocampal circuits. Neuroplasticity is the ability to adapt and reorganize the structure or function to internal or external stimuli and occurs at the cellular, population, network or behavioral level and is reflected in the cytological and network architecture as well as in intrinsic properties of hippocampal neurons and circuits. The high degree of hippocampal neuroplasticity might, however, be also negatively reflected in the pronounced vulnerability of the hippocampus to deleterious conditions such as ischemia, epilepsy, chronic stress, neurodegeneration and aging targeting hippocampal structure and function and leading to cognitive deficits. Considering this framework of plasticity and vulnerability, we here review basic principles of hippocampal anatomy and neuroplasticity on various levels as well as recent findings regarding the functional organization of the hippocampus in light of the regional vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease, ischemia, epilepsy, neuroinflammation and aging.

284,"Technical advances in x-ray microbeam radiation therapy. In the last 25 years microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional radiation therapy at large, third generation synchrotrons. In MRT, a multi-slit collimator modulates a kilovoltage x-ray beam on a micrometer scale, creating peak dose areas with unconventionally high doses of several hundred Grays separated by low dose valley regions, where the dose remains well below the tissue tolerance level. Pre-clinical evidence demonstrates that such beam geometries lead to substantially reduced damage to normal tissue at equal tumour control rates and hence drastically increase the therapeutic window. Although the mechanisms behind MRT are still to be elucidated, previous studies indicate that immune response, tumour microenvironment, and the microvasculature may play a crucial role. Beyond tumour therapy, MRT has also been suggested as a microsurgical tool in neurological disorders and as a primer for drug delivery. The physical properties of MRT demand innovative medical physics and engineering solutions for safe treatment delivery. This article reviews technical developments in MRT and discusses existing solutions for dosimetric validation, reliable treatment planning and safety. Instrumentation at synchrotron facilities, including beam production, collimators and patient positioning systems, is also discussed. Specific solutions reviewed in this article include: dosimetry techniques that can cope with high spatial resolution, low photon energies and extremely high dose rates of up to 15 000 Gy s<sup>-1</sup>, dose calculation algorithms-apart from pure Monte Carlo Simulations-to overcome the challenge of small voxel sizes and a wide dynamic dose-range, and the use of dose-enhancing nanoparticles to combat the limited penetrability of a kilovoltage energy spectrum. Finally, concepts for alternative compact microbeam sources are presented, such as inverse Compton scattering set-ups and carbon nanotube x-ray tubes, that may facilitate the transfer of MRT into a hospital-based clinical environment. Intensive research in recent years has resulted in practical solutions to most of the technical challenges in MRT. Treatment planning, dosimetry and patient safety systems at synchrotrons have matured to a point that first veterinary and clinical studies in MRT are within reach. Should these studies confirm the promising results of pre-clinical studies, the authors are confident that MRT will become an effective new radiotherapy option for certain patients.",Excluded,0.10361845
285,"Space-clamp problems when voltage clamping neurons expressing voltage-gated conductances. The voltage-clamp technique is applicable only to spherical cells. In nonspherical cells, such as neurons, the membrane potential is not clamped distal to the voltage-clamp electrode. This means that the current recorded by the voltage-clamp electrode is the sum of the local current and of axial currents from locations experiencing different membrane potentials. Furthermore, voltage-gated currents recorded from a nonspherical cell are, by definition, severely distorted due to the lack of space clamp. Justifications for voltage clamping in nonspherical cells are, first, that the lack of space clamp is not severe in neurons with short dendrites. Second, passive cable theory may be invoked to justify application of voltage clamp to branching neurons, suggesting that the potential decay is sufficiently shallow to allow spatial clamping of the neuron. Here, using numerical simulations, we show that the distortions of voltage-gated K(+) and Ca(2+) currents are substantial even in neurons with short dendrites. The simulations also demonstrate that passive cable theory cannot be used to justify voltage clamping of neurons due to significant shunting to the reversal potential of the voltage-gated conductance during channel activation. Some of the predictions made by the simulations were verified using somatic and dendritic voltage-clamp experiments in rat somatosensory cortex. Our results demonstrate that voltage-gated K(+) and Ca(2+) currents recorded from branching neurons are almost always severely distorted.",Excluded,0.10464172

OBJECTIVES: To report outcomes of patients with medical and/or surgical refractory trigeminal neuralgia (TN) treated with gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GK SRS).METHODS: One hundred and forty-nine patients with 152 cases of TN treated with GK SRS were analyzed. All patients, except one, received a dose of 40Gy to the 50% isodose volume. The Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain intensity score was used to grade pain. Actuarial rates of pain relief were calculated. Multiple factors were analyzed for association with pain relief.RESULTS: The median follow up was 27 months (4-71 months). Overall 92% of cases achieved a BNI score I-III after GK SRS. Of those who had pain relief after GK SRS, 32% developed pain recurrence defined as a BNI score of IV or V. The actuarial rate of freedom from pain recurrence (BNI scores I-III) of all treated cases at 1, 2 and 3-years was 76%, 69% and 60%, respectively. On univariate analysis age >=70 was predictive of better pain relief (p=0.046). Type of pain, prior surgery, multiple sclerosis, number of isocenters, treated nerve length, volume and thickness and distance from the root entry zone to the isocenter were not significant for maintaining a BNI score of I-III. Those who achieved a BNI score of I or II were more likely to maintain pain relief compared to those who only achieved a BNI score of III (93% vs 38% at three years, p<0.01). The rate of pain relief of twenty-seven patients who underwent repeat GK SRS was 70% and 62% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Toxicity after first GK SRS was minimal with 25% of cases experiencing only new or worsening post-treatment numbness.CONCLUSION: GK SRS provides acceptable pain relief with limited morbidity in patients with medical and/or surgical refractory TN.",Excluded,0.10711076
288,"Ataxia telangiectasia mutant protein activates c-Abl tyrosine kinase in response to ionizing radiation. Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare human autosomal recessive disorder with pleiotropic phenotypes, including neuronal degeneration, immune dysfunction, premature ageing and increased cancer risk. The gene mutated in AT, ATM, encodes a putative lipid or protein kinase. Most of the human AT patient phenotypes are recapitulated in Atm-deficient mice. Cells derived from Atm-/- mice, like those from AT patients, exhibit abnormal response to ionizing radiation. One of the known responses to ionizing radiation is the activation of a nuclear tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-abl proto-oncogene. Ionizing radiation does not activate c-Abl in cells from AT patients or in thymocytes or fibroblasts from the Atm-deficient mice. Ectopic expression of a functional ATM kinase domain corrects this defect, as it phosphorylates the c-Abl tyrosine kinase in vitro at Ser 465, leading to the activation of c-Abl. A mutant c-Abl with Ser 465 changed to Ala 465 is not activated by ionizing radiation or ATM kinase in vivo. These findings identify the c-Abl tyrosine kinase as a downstream target of phosphorylation and activation by the ATM kinase in the cellular response to ionizing radiation.",Excluded,0.7697619

Aiming to study how glioma cells respond to gamma-rays in terms of biological processes involved in cellular responses, we performed experiments at cellular context and gene expression analysis in U343-MG-a GBM cells irradiated with 1 Gy and collected at 6 h post-irradiation. The survival rate was approximately 61% for 1 Gy and was completely reduced at 16 Gy. By performing the microarray technique, 859 cDNA clones were analyzed. The Significance Analysis of Microarray algorithm indicated 196 significant expressed genes (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.42%): 67 down-regulated and 97 up-regulated genes, which belong to several classes: metabolism, adhesion/cytoskeleton, signal transduction, cell cycle/apoptosis, membrane transport, DNA repair/DNA damage signaling, transcription factor, intracellular signaling, and RNA processing. Differential expression patterns of five selected genes (HSPA9B, INPP5A, PIP5K1A, FANCG, and TPP2) observed by the microarray analysis were further confirmed by the quantitative real time RT-PCR method, which demonstrated an up-regulation status of those genes.

291,"Photoinactivation of an identified motoneurone in the locust Locusta migratoria. 1. The common inhibitory motoneurone 1 (CI1) in the mesothoracic ganglion of the locust was photoinactivated using a helium-cadmium laser or a mercury lamp as light source. Treated animals showed no signs of abnormal locomotory behaviour over periods of up to 40 days. 2. Photoinactivation of part of the neurone in the ganglion, i.e. the soma and the primary neurite, is sufficient to cause irreversible degeneration of all the peripheral extensions of the neurone. Three weeks after photoinactivation, all GABA immunoreactivity had disappeared from the axon branches of the photoinactivated neurone and from their terminals on one of the target muscles investigated, the anterior coxa rotator M92, and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials could no longer be elicited through stimulation. This was taken as proof of functional denervation of the muscle with regard to its inhibitory input. By this time, the axon of CI1 in nerve N3C1, which supplies M92, had also disappeared. 3. Animals treated during the fourth or fifth instars showed a permanent loss of the photoinactivated mesothoracic CI1 neurone after moulting into adulthood. 4. Denervation of M92 in the middle legs of instars and adults by axotomy of N3 always led to rapid functional reinnervation of the muscle. The first sign of reinnervation (excitatory neuromuscular activity upon mechanical stimulation of the tarsi) was detected electrophysiologically as early as 8 days after severing the motor nerve. 5. The elimination of CI1 by photoinactivation for a period of up to 40 days did not influence parameters of the target muscle, such as size, number of fibres and phenotypes of fibres defined histochemically according to their myofibrillar ATPase isoforms, irrespective of whether the operation was performed in instars or adults. Similarly, the short period of denervation following axotomy before reinnervation took place did not affect the fibre type composition of the muscle.",Excluded,0.10494497

Introduction: Lung cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies; however, no serum marker has been routinely recommended until now. Method(s): This is a prospective case control study including two groups of patients: Group Ipatients with advanced lung cancer and Group IIpatients with benign lung disease as control. Serum cytokeratin 19 (CK19) fragment levels were measured at baseline by real-time polymerase chain reaction before first-line chemotherapy. The CK19 cut-off taken was 15-cycle threshold. The primary end point was the comparison of high CK19 in cases and controls. The secondary end point was the correlation between high CK19 and progressive disease (PD), progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS) in advanced lung cancer patients. Result(s): A total of 30 patients with advanced lung cancer (16 non-small and 14 small cell lung cancer) and 15 patients with benign lung disease were included and followed up during the period from October 2008 to October 2011 with median follow-up of one and half years. High CK19 was found in 90% of lung cancer cases as compared with 7% in controls (p < 0.001). High CK19 was found in all cases showing PD (p = 0.04). One-year OS in high CK was 61% as compared with 33% in normal CK (p = 0.1).

Introduction: Craniopharyngiomas occur in proximity to vessels of the circle of Willis, which may require manipulation in the course of surgical dissection. The tumors are frequently irradiated which may predispose to vascular abnormalities. We reviewed a large center's experience. Method(s): Records of the brain tumor program, spanning 21 years, were reviewed for patients with craniopharyngioma. Demographics, details of treatment, clinical course, and Results of imaging over time are described. Result(s): 50 patients with craniopharyngioma were identified, 8 of whom were excluded for inadequate data. 42 patients were followed over a mean of 7.2 years after treatment, 17 of whom eventually were found to have vascular abnormalities. Of these patients, 2 had received craniotomy alone with no radiation. The remainder had radiation, 4 after failure of initial intracystic therapy and either with or without further operation. 11 were treated with operation, either craniotomy or endoscopic biopsy or resection, followed by radiation. 3 patients developed cavernous malformations, 9 patients had aneurysmal dilatation of one or more vessels, and 10 had vessel narrowing or occlusion, which in some was documented to progress. Mean time to identification of the first abnormality was 3.4 years after radiation, and 1.4 years after operation alone. 2 patients with moya moya syndrome after radiation required cerebral revascularization procedures.

Two readers independently assessed the subjective image quality across multiple vascular segments on a Likert-like scale. Differences in contrast dose, CT dose index (CTDI), and dose length product (DLP) were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Fisher's exact test was used to compare subjective image quality. Similarly, contrast- and signal-to-noise ratios (CNR and SNR) were compared in the mid-M1 MCA vessels bilaterally and the mid-basilar artery using Mann-Whitney U test. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for the SNR/CNR values.RESULTS: Both observers showed excellent correlation in subjective image quality (mean percentage agreement of 95.2% for group 1 versus 89.2% for group 2). LD-CTA group showed better SNR and CNR (p < 0.0001) for both MCA vessels and the mid-basilar artery. Interclass correlation coefficient showed moderate correlation (0.51-0.63) between readers.

298,"Microstructural white matter correlates of motor fatigue in multiple sclerosis-a diffusion weighted imaging study. Introduction: Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS). It contributes significantly to reduced quality of life. Some studies suggest that fatigue is a consequence of microstructural disease alterations in specific white matter (WM) tracts - e.g., right anterior thalamic radiation (rATR) (Bester 2013, Gobbi 2014). However, others have not been able to find any associations between WM changes and fatigue. Consequently, the role of microstructural WM changes in the pathophysiology of fatigue remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between WM microstructural brain pathology and motor fatigue in MS. Method(s): We included 50 mildly disabled relapsing remitting MS patients from the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Centre and 25 age -and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). Fatigue was evaluated with the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC). Additionally, all participants underwent a standard MS test-battery and a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination including conventional scans and Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI). i) The local microstructural brain structures were assessed with fractional anisotropy (FA) for detecting the voxelwise indicating indices of WM abnormalities compared to HC. ii) The disruption of neural fibres connecting specific brain areas was assessed with anatomical connectivity mapping (ACM), which reflects the strength of connectedness of each WM voxel to the entire brain (Lyksborg 2014). iii) We also assessed the correlation between fatigue scores and MS-related WM pathology. Result(s): Relative to HC, MS patients showed reduced FA and ACM in the body of the corpus callosum (CC) containing motor fibres (p< 0.001 and p=0.022 respectively, FWE corrected at the cluster level). We did not find statistically significant correlations between motor fatigue and microstructural disease alterations in rATR (p>0.900) (extracted with the JHU White-Matter Tractography Atlas) or using a whole brain white-matter mask (p>0.706). Conclusion(s): The microstructure in the body of CC, including the transcallosal motor fibres, was significantly altered in the MS group relative to HC. This suggests that individuals with MS have a changed interhemispheric connectivity in the commissural motor fibres. Since we found no association between regional WM microstructure and fatigue, our data do not support the notion that a local structural WM change may be critical for the emergence of fatigue in MS.",Excluded,0.10468639

STUDY OBJECTIVE: We describe patient perceptions of computed tomography (CT) and their understanding of radiation exposure and risk.METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of acute abdominal pain patients aged 18 years or older. Confidence in medical evaluations with increasing levels of laboratory testing and imaging was rated on a 100-point visual analog scale. Knowledge of radiation exposure was ascertained when participants compared the radiation dose of one abdomen-pelvis CT with 2-view chest radiography. To assess cancer risk knowledge, participants rated their agreement with these factual statements: ""Approximately 2 to 3 abdominal CTs give the same radiation exposure as experienced by Hiroshima survivors"" and ""2 to 3 abdominal CTs over a person's lifetime can increase cancer risk."" Previous CT was also assessed.RESULTS: There were 1,168 participants, 67% women and mean age 40.7 years (SD 15.9 years). Median confidence in a medical evaluation without ancillary testing was 20 (95% confidence interval [CI] 16 to 25) compared with 90 (95% CI 88 to 91) when laboratory testing and CT were included. More than 70% of participants underestimated the radiation dose of CT relative to chest radiography, and cancer risk comprehension was poor. Median agreement with the Hiroshima statement was 13 (95% CI 10 to 16) and 45 (95% CI 40 to 45) with the increased lifetime cancer risk statement. Seven hundred ninety-five patients reported receiving a previous CT. Of 365 patients who reported no previous CT, 142 (39%) had one documented in our electronic medical record.CONCLUSION: Patients are more confident when CT imaging is part of their medical evaluation but have a poor understanding of the concomitant radiation exposure and risk and underestimate their previous imaging experience.",Excluded,0.10545195

Photoperiod is essential in manipulating sexual maturity and reproductive performance in avian species. Light can be perceived by photoreceptors in the retina of the eye, pineal gland, and hypothalamus. However, the relative sensitivity and specificity of each organ to wavelength, and consequently the physiological effects, may differ. The purpose of this experiment was to test the impacts of light wavelengths on reproduction, growth, and stress in laying hens maintained in cages and to determine whether the retina of the eye is necessary. Individual cages in 3 optically isolated sections of a single room were equipped with LED strips providing either pure green, pure red or white light (red, green, and blue) set to 10 lx (hens levels). The involvement of the retina on mediating the effects of light wavelength was assessed by using a naturally blind line (Smoky Joe) of chickens. Red and white lights resulted in higher estradiol concentrations after photostimulation, indicating stronger ovarian activation, which translated into a significantly lower age at first egg when compared with the green light. Similarly, hens maintained under red and white lights had a longer and higher peak production and higher cumulative egg number than hens under green light. No significant difference in BW gain was observed until sexual maturation. However, from 23 wk of age onward, birds exposed to green light showed higher body growth, which may be the result of their lower egg production. Although corticosterone levels were higher at 20 wk of age in hens under red light, concentrations were below levels that can be considered indicative of stress. Because no significant differences were observed between blind and sighted birds maintained under red and white light, the retina of the eye did not participate in the activation of reproduction. In summary, red light was required to stimulate the reproductive axis whereas green light was ineffective, and the effects of stimulatory wavelengths do not appear to require a functional retina of the eye.",Excluded,0.104901575
305,"Patient-Specific Screening Using High-Grade Glioma Explants to Determine Potential Radiosensitization by a TGF-beta Small Molecule Inhibitor. High-grade glioma (HGG), a deadly primary brain malignancy, manifests radioresistance mediated by cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental mechanisms. High levels of the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in HGG promote radioresistance by enforcing an effective DNA damage response and supporting glioma stem cell self-renewal. Our analysis of HGG TCGA data and immunohistochemical staining of phosphorylated Smad2, which is the main transducer of canonical TGF-beta signaling, indicated variable levels of TGF-beta pathway activation across HGG tumors. These data suggest that evaluating the putative benefit of inhibiting TGF-beta during radiotherapy requires personalized screening. Thus, we used explant cultures of seven HGG specimens as a rapid, patient-specific ex vivo platform to test the hypothesis that LY364947, a small molecule inhibitor of the TGF-beta type I receptor, acts as a radiosensitizer in HGG. Immunofluorescence detection and image analysis of gamma-H2AX foci, a marker of cellular recognition of radiation-induced DNA damage, and Sox2, a stem cell marker that increases post-radiation, indicated that LY364947 blocked these radiation responses in five of seven specimens. Collectively, our findings suggest that TGF-beta signaling increases radioresistance in most, but not all, HGGs. We propose that short-term culture of HGG explants provides a flexible and rapid platform for screening context-dependent efficacy of radiosensitizing agents in patient-specific fashion. This time- and cost-effective approach could be used to personalize treatment plans in HGG patients.",Excluded,0.30755198
306,"Visible light modulates the expression of cancer-retina antigens. Proteins involved in the visual signaling cascade show light-dependent expression levels in photoreceptor cells. Recently, these proteins have been described to be expressed in neuroectodermal tumors and to function as cancer-retina antigens. Here, we show that light can down-regulate gene expression of rhodopsin, transducin, and cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) and up-regulate guanylyl cyclase 1, recoverin, and arrestin in human melanoma cells in vitro, comparable to physiologic changes earlier observed in photoreceptor cells. Similar modulation can be detected at the protein level in melanoma cells except for no changes in PDE6 protein levels. Two regulatory pathways have been identified: Sp1/Sp3/Sp4 proteins for rhodopsin and PDE6, and mitogen-activated protein kinases for recoverin and arrestin. The visual cascade and retinoic acid as its derivate do not play any role in this process. Putative explanations for light-dependent modulation of cancer-retina antigen expression in melanoma cells are discussed.",Excluded,0.102787085

308,"Gene expression, telomere and cognitive deficit analysis as a function of Chornobyl radiation dose and age: from in utero to adulthood. UNLABELLED: Objective - to estimate the possible effects of low dose ionizing radiation on human cognitive function in adult hood and in utero.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cognitive tests, telomere length and expression of genes regulating telomere function were studied in Chornobyl cleanup workers who were exposed to doses under 500 mSv (n = 326) and subjects exposed in utero during the first days after the accident Prypiat town (n = 104). The neurocognitive assessment covered mem ory, attention, language, executive and visiospatial functions. In young adults after prenatal exposure a relation ship was analyzed between a cognitive function and radiation dose to foetus, brain and thyroid gland. Internal con trols were used for both groups - the group of Chornobyl cleanup workers exposed in doses less than 20 mSv and an age matched comparison group from radioactively contaminated areas for subjects exposed in utero.RESULTS: Cognitive functions in cleanup workers exposed to ionizing radiation at adulthood are characterized by symptoms of a mild cognitive impairment according to the MMSE (mean group score 25,58 +/- 2,95) and a significant ly higher level of mental disorders according to the BPRS in a dose related manner. Cleanup workers exposed to doses over 500 mSv demonstrate a significant cognitive deficit in comparison with those exposed below 500 mSv and espe cially non exposed patients. Subjects exposed in utero during the check at age of 25-27 years exhibit an excess of the disorders of autonomic nervous system (ICD 10: G90). Neurological microsymptoms as well as neurotic, stress relat ed and somatoform disorders (F40-F48) dominate. Relationship were revealed between the TERT, TERF1, TERF2 genes expression, relative telomere length (RTL),cognitive deficit and cerebrovascular pathology, radiation dose and age. Telomere length in cleanup workers is sreduced after 50 years (6.1 %). The most significant reduction in telomere length is shown after 70 years (11.7 %). Negative correlation was found between telomere length and degree of cog nitive deficit (MMSE scale) and between age and degree of cognitive deficit. The RTL is significantly decreased in groups of persons with cognitive deficit compared to a comparison group. Telomere length at the late period after low dose radiation exposure is downregulated by the high TERF2 gene expression combined with low expression of TERT gene. After exposure to doses over 250-500 mSv a cognitive deficit and dementia were associated with a substantial increase in TERT gene expression, overexpression of TERF1 and decrease in expression of TERF2 gene. A relationship was revealed between the TERF2 gene expression and CD95+ cell fraction susceptible to apoptosis.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that cognitive deficit in humans at a late period after radiation exposure is influ enced by dose, age at exposure and gene regulation of telomere function.",Included,0.9240498
309,"Diseases of Circulatory System and Comorbid Type Ii Diabetes Mellitus in the Chornobyl Accident Consequences Clean-up Workers. OBJECTIVE: The study was focused on evaluation of peculiarities of the clinical manifestations of type II diabetesmellitus (TIIDM) in the Chornobyl nuclear power plant (ChNPP) accident clean-up workers (ACUW).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ChNPP ACUW of 1986-1987 period (n = 449, males) and 158 males not exposed to ion-izing radiation (the control group, CG) were involved in the study in 2013-2018. Diagnosis of cardiovascular disease(CVD) and type II diabetes mellitus (TIIDM) was established in accordance with diagnostic standards adopted inUkraine. All study subjects had no signs of CVD, and neither of endocrine disease nor of metabolic disorders beforethe accident.RESULTS: Clinical course of the TIIDM, depending on the disease severity, onset of angiopathy and polyneuropathy,prevalence of angina pectoris and heart failure were surveyed and analyzed. Concomitant TIIDM was associated witha higher incidence of angina pectoris and heart failure. According to the Kaplan-Meier method of survival estimatingthe accumulation of new TIIDM cases occurred faster in the ACUW compared with individuals in the CG, however withno statistical significance in subjects aged up to 60 years old (log-rank test chi2 = 4.89, p = 0.027). Mean age of theACUW having comorbid CVD and DM was (54.6 +/- 9.7) years, whilst in the CG it was (59.9 +/- 10.7) years (p = 0.005).CONCLUSIONS: The DM course in the ACUW was not significantly different from non-irradiated control both in sever-ity and such complications as angiopathy of retina and lower extremities, as well as manifestations of lower extrem-ity polyneuropathy. Clinical manifestations of CVD in the form of angina pectoris and heart failure were identical inthe ACUW and control group of patients having a comorbid TIIDM. The latter was a factor exacerbating the CVDcourse and leading to a higher prevalence of angina pectoris and heart failure both in the ACUW and in non-irritat-ed individuals. Accumulation of the new DM cases occurred more rapidly in ACUW vs. non-irradiated control, so theywere in average 5 years younger at the time of TIIDM manifestation than the control subjects.",Included,0.9236287
310,"Correlation between the light scattering and the mitochondrial content of normal tissues and transplantable rodent tumors. The development of noninvasive optical studies necessitates an understanding of the biological parameters which affect light propagation in soft tissues. In the present report, we have measured the optical properties of various normal (i.e., perfused liver, brain, skeletal muscle, white adipose tissue) and neoplastic rodent tissues (i.e., glioma, hepatoma, mammary adenocarcinoma) by using time-resolved spectroscopy. The contribution of the hemoglobin (+ myoglobin in the case of muscle) to the total light absorption at 780 nm has been determined. This contribution varies from about 25% (brain, skeletal muscle) to about 100% (white adipose tissue, 13762A mammary adenocarcinoma, 9L glioma). These results are explained by different blood volume fractions in the tissues and by the existence at 780 nm of other chromophores, such as the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. Secondly, the dependence of the light scattering of the tissue on both the cell and the mitochondrial content has been analyzed. The results indicate that there is no correlation between the light scattering and the DNA content, measured as an indicator of the cell number in the tissue. The scattering coefficient is proportional to both the succinate dehydrogenase activity and the mitochondrial protein content of the tissue, which are indicators of the mitochondria content of the tissue when based upon estimates of tissue wet weight.",Excluded,0.102214575

312,"Synapses in the fly motion-vision pathway: evidence for a broad range of signal amplitudes and dynamics. Synapses are generally considered to operate efficiently only when their signaling range matches the spectrum of prevailing presynaptic signals in terms of both amplitudes and dynamics. However, the prerequisites for optimally matching the signaling ranges may differ between spike-mediated and graded synaptic transmission. This poses a problem for synapses that convey both graded and spike signals at the same time. We addressed this issue by tracing transmission systematically in vivo in the blowfly's visual-motion pathway by recording from single neurons that receive mixed potential signals consisting of rather slow graded fluctuations superimposed with highly variable spikes from a small number of presynaptic elements. Both pre- and postsynaptic neurons were previously shown to represent preferred-direction motion velocity reliably and linearly at low fluctuation frequencies. To selectively assess the performance of individual synapses and to precisely control presynaptic signals, we voltage clamped one of the presynaptic neurons. Results showed that synapses can effectively convey signals over a much larger amplitude and frequency range than is normally used during graded transmission of visual signals. An explanation for this unexpected finding might lie in the transmission of the spike component that reaches larger amplitudes and contains higher frequencies than graded signals.",Excluded,0.103582636
313,"X-ray microtomography (microCT) using phase contrast for the investigation of organic matter. PURPOSE: We show that microtomography (microCT) using synchrotron radiation (SR) can be extended to include X-ray phase contrast, which is two to three orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional attenuation contrast and better suited for the investigation of specimens consisting chiefly of light elements for photon energies ranging at least from 1 to 100 keV.METHOD: Phase contrast is generated by placing the specimen in one of the interfering beams of an X-ray interferometer. With use of 12-keV X-rays, phase projections of the specimen are recorded at 180 or 360 angular settings equally spaced between 0 and 180 degrees. One phase projection consists of four pairs of ""associated"" radiograms in the sense that one is taken with and the other without the specimen in the beam. Between pairs a parallel-sided phase-shifter plate is rotated for changing the relative phase of the two interfering beams by multiples of pi/2 rad. By calculating phase-weighted sums of all associated pairs of radiograms, true phase-shift projections are obtained for all angular settings of the specimen, which are then reconstructed.RESULTS: Three-dimensional images have been obtained from rat cerebrum and rat trigeminal nerve, showing cell structures at 8- to 15-micron spatial resolution. Gray and white matter of cerebrum and neurons in the trigeminal nerve are clearly visible.CONCLUSION: X-ray phase-contrast microCT is becoming a valuable tool for studies of organic samples in medicine and biology.",Excluded,0.105593055

Effects of different scatter compensation methods incorporated in fully 3D iterative reconstruction are investigated. The methods are: (i) the inclusion of an 'ideal scatter estimate' (ISE); (ii) like (i) but with a noiseless scatter estimate (ISE-NF); (iii) incorporation of scatter in the point spread function during iterative reconstruction ('ideal scatter model', ISM); (iv) no scatter compensation (NSC); (v) ideal scatter rejection (ISR), as can be approximated by using a camera with a perfect energy resolution. The iterative method used was an ordered subset expectation maximization (OS- EM) algorithm. A cylinder containing small cold spheres was used to calculate contrast-to-noise curves. For a brain study, global errors between reconstruction and 'true' distributions were calculated. Results show that ISR is superior to all other methods. In all cases considered, ISM is superior to ISE and performs approximately as well as (brain study) or better than (cylinder data) ISE-NF. Both ISM and ISE improve contrast-to-noise curves and reduce global errors, compared with NSC. In the case of ISE, blurring of the scatter estimate with a Gaussian kernel results in slightly reduced errors in brain studies, especially at low count levels. The optimal Gaussian kernel size is strongly dependent on the noise level.",Excluded,0.102674246
315,"Specific absorption rate variation in a brain phantom due to exposure by a 3G mobile phone: Problems in dosimetry. A specific absorption rate (SAR) measurements system has been developed for compliance testing of personal mobile phone in a brain phantom material contained in a Perspex box. The volume of the box has been chosen corresponding to the volume of a small rat and illuminated by a 3G mobile phone frequency (1718.5 MHz), and the emitted radiation directed toward brain phantom. The induced fields in the phantom material are measured. Set up to lift the plane carrying the mobile phone is run by a pulley whose motion is controlled by a stepper motor. The platform is made to move at a pre-determined rate of 2degree per min limited up to 20degree. The measured data for induced fields in various locations are used to compute corresponding SAR values and inter comparison obtained. These data are also compared with those when the mobile phone is placed horizontally with respect to the position of the animal. The SAR data is also experimentally obtained by measuring a rise in temperature due to this mobile exposures and data compared with those obtained in the previous set. To seek a comparison with the safety criteria same set of measurements are performed in 10 g phantom material contained in a cubical box. These results are higher than those obtained with the knowledge of induced field measurements. It is concluded that SAR values are sensitive to the angular position of the moving platform and are well below the safety criteria prescribed for human exposure.

These patients primarily visit the clinics with complain of pain with poor quality of life and functional disability. Methods To analyze the demographics, treatment profile and survival of cases treated in different centers combined. A total of 500 patients with symptomatic bone metastases were studied retrospectively over the period of 4 years from 2013 to 2017. Results The median age of presentation was 50 years. The most common primary cancer associated with bonemetastasis were prostate (32%), breast (35%) and lung (30%). Almost 75% cases of bone metastasis in female patients encountered due to breast followed by cervix and lung. The predominant reason for clinical presentation was bony and/or neuropathic pain (70%), followed by pathological fracture (20%), including spinal cord compression and fracture impending associated with or without soft tissue mass (10%). Out of 410, 30% had synchronous visceral metastasis to single or multiple sites like brain, lung and liver. 90% cases received palliative radiation with multiple radiation dosing schedules, decided a per the patient's general conditions. The median survival observed was 12-60 months in prostate, 7-15 months in lung; 12-30 months in breast cancer and 20 months in thyroid.

The International Space Station Expedition was incorrectly referred to as ""the Skylab Expedition 18."" A correction has been made to the In-Flight Protocols section: ""In-flight exercise protocols are generally designed to minimize the loss in aerobic capacity, bone, muscle strength and endurance and to counteract neuromuscular dysfunction. The main goal thereby is to maintain in-flight and post-flight performance capabilities of the astronauts (Loehr et al., 2015). Crewmembers are commanded to adhere to their personal exercise protocols, including resistance (ARED) and cardiovascular exercise on a Treadmill or Veloergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization System (TVIS, CEVIS). The training devices save personal data as well as physiological and training parameter, which allows the Mission Control Center (based on Earth) to adjust individual exercise schedules. Since the installation of the ARED in the International Space Station Expedition 18, high resistances can be applied during strength training on the ISS and the device allows about 29 different exercises. However, the ARED is very space-consuming and carries the potential risk of being temporarily unavailable due to technical faults (Hanson et al., 2014; Loehr et al., 2015), which motivates the search for and the exploration of smaller and technically simpler devices (Behringer et al., 2016). In addition, high training intensities are associated with an increased risk of injury to the musculoskeletal system (Gabbett, 2016), a fact to be taken seriously, as training-related injuries are the most common source of injury to astronauts on board the ISS (Scheuring et al., 2009).

318,"Plasma membrane nanoporation as a possible mechanism behind infrared excitation of cells. OBJECTIVE: Short infrared (IR) laser pulses have been used to stimulate action potentials in neurons both in vivo and in vitro. However, the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon has remained elusive. In vitro studies have found that pulsed IR exposure generates a nearly instant change in capacitance in the plasma membrane, characterized by inward rectification, a common feature in pore-forming exposures, such as electrical pulses and acoustic shock waves. Based on this similarity, we hypothesize that the mechanism of IR stimulation is the formation of short-lived nanopores in the plasma membrane. These transient, small-diameter pores allow the influx of extracellular ions that lead to action potential generation, possibly through activation of secondary messenger pathways or depolarization of the cell membrane resulting in activation of voltage-gated ion channels.APPROACH: A variety of fluorescent markers are used to observe the cell response to IR stimulation to monitor for effects indicative of nanoporation in other modalities.MAIN RESULTS: We observe rapid, transient rises in intracellular Ca(2+), influx of YO-PRO-1 and propidium iodide into the cell signifying membrane permeabilization, cellular blebbing and swelling, and activation of the intracellular phosphoinositides lipid signaling pathway.SIGNIFICANCE: This conclusion better explains the experimental observations and limitations of IR-induced neurological stimulation and represents a distinct theoretical shift in the understanding of the mechanism of IR-induced stimulation.",Excluded,0.10379701
319,"Effect of low dose radiation on cognition, cortisol, serotonin and antioxidant status. Radiation exposure has multiple effects on the brain, behaviour and cognitive functions. These changes depend largely on the dose received and time. While high radiation doses can cause severe tissue destruction, lower doses can induce cognitive impairments without signs of overt tissue damage. Radiation-induced cognitive impairments are reported to occur in up to 50-90% of adult brain tumour patients who survive more than 6 months post-irradiation. This study was undertaken to assess the acute effects of low doses of radiation on cognitive functions, serum cortisol, serotonin and antioxidant status, 2-month-old C57BL/6J mice received either sham treatment or irradiation (0.5, 1 and 3 Gy) and were tested for the alterations in the normal behaviour within 10 days. And a blood Serotonin and cortisol analysis was carried out using ELISA kits. Results obtained were analysed using one-way ANOVA. There was a significant decline in exploratory activity of mice exposed to 3 Gy and 1 Gy radiation in open field test. We observed a significant decline in spontaneous Percent Alternation indicating the short-term memory loss in 3 Gy and 1 Gy irradiated mice in Y-Maze. 1 and 3 Gy irradiated mice exhibited increased anxiety in EPM. The increased anxiety and memory loss patterns were also seen in 0.5 Gy irradiated mice, but the results were statistically not significant. The changes to cortisol level were in a dose dependent manner and serotonin levels decreased with dose. Total antioxidant levels also showed the decreasing trend with respect to radiation doses, this pattern is similar to the pattern of cognitive decline shown in behaviour analysis suggesting that the antioxidant status maybe co-related to the radiation induced cognitive decline.

Results were validated using qRT-PCR and confirmed using the regulatable MYCN expression system (SHEP Tet21N).RESULTS: MYCN knockdown altered the expression of several cell cycle related genes. SKP2 was down regulated in both cell lines, and up regulated in MYCN+ Tet21N cells. Expression of the WNT antagonist DKK3 increased in both cell lines and decreased in MYCN+ Tet21N cells. Expression of CDKN1C (p57(cip2)) and TP53INP1 also increased after MYCN knockdown.CONCLUSIONS: MYCN may override the G1 checkpoint through down-regulation of SKP2 and TP53INP1 resulting in reduced p21(WAF1) expression in p53 wt cell lines, and in addition may act through the WNT signaling pathway in a p53 independent manner.",Excluded,0.10718872

Astronauts on lengthy voyages will be exposed to an environment of microgravity and ionizing radiation that may have adverse effects on physical abilities, mood, and cognitive functioning. However, little is known about the long-term effects of combined microgravity and low-dose radiation. We exposed mice to gamma radiation using a cobalt-57 plate (0.01 cGy/h for a total dose of 0.04 Gy), hindlimb unloading to simulate microgravity, or a combination of both for 3 weeks. Mice then underwent a behavioral test battery after 1 week, 1 month, 4 months, and 8 months to assess sensorimotor coordination/balance (rotarod), activity levels (open field), learned helplessness/depression-like behavior (tail suspension test), risk-taking (elevated zero maze), and spatial learning/memory (water maze). Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression was assessed in the brain after behavioral testing to determine blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Mice that received unloading spent significantly more time in the exposed portions of the elevated zero maze, were hypoactive in the open field, and spent less time struggling on the tail suspension test than mice that did not receive unloading. Mice in the combination group expressed more AQP4 immunoactivity than controls. Elevated zero maze and AQP4 data were correlated. No differences were seen on the water maze or rotarod, and no radiation-only effects were observed. These results suggest that microgravity may lead to changes in exploratory/risk-taking behaviors in the absence of other sensorimotor or cognitive deficits and that combined microgravity and a chronic, low dose of gamma radiation may lead to BBB dysfunction.",Included,0.9240623

Objective: To present a case of a patient with metastatic follicular thyroid cancer with hemorrhagic metastases to the pituitary gland who presented with diabetes insipidus (DI). Case Presentation: A 56 year-old man with metastatic follicular thyroid cancer presented with failure to thrive. Eight years prior to admission he underwent a left hemi-thyroidectomy for a compressive goiter with pathology noting a follicular adenoma. Four years later while undergoing routine imaging, multiple lung and bone lesions were identified prompting a bone biopsy with pathology of metastatic follicular thyroid cancer. A complete thyroidectomy with lymph node dissection was performed confirming follicular thyroid cancer. Over the next several years, due to persistent disease confirmed both biochemically and with imaging, the patient received external bean radiation followed by 6 doses RAI totaling over 1200 mCi resulting in pancytopenia, thus precluding the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Five months after his last dose of RAI, the patient presented to our hospital with failure to thrive. Labs included TSH 0.021 mcU/ mL (on levothyroxine), thyroglobulin > 47000 ng/mL (antibody negative). Palliative care was consulted and dexamethasone was started for appetite stimulation. The following month the patient presented with confusion, blurry vision, polydipsia, polyuria with severe nocturia impacting his quality of life. Labs included sodium 140 mEq/L, serum osmolarity 288 mOsm/kg, urine osmolarity 192 mOsm/kg and urine sodium 39 mmol/L. Noncontrast MRI head showed a large mushroom appearing sellar lesion with hemorrhagic supra-sellar component compressing the optic chiasm. Dexamethasone was increased and intranasal DDVAP started for symptomatic relief. Patient was discharged on home hospice and passed away 6 weeks later.

We investigated whether exposure of rat brain to microwaves (MWs) of global system for mobile communication (GSM) induces DNA breaks, changes in chromatin conformation and in gene expression. An exposure installation was used based on a test mobile phone employing a GSM signal at 915 MHz, all standard modulations included, output power level in pulses 2 W, specific absorption rate (SAR) 0.4 mW/g. Rats were exposed or sham exposed to MWs during 2 h. After exposure, cell suspensions were prepared from brain samples, as well as from spleen and thymus. For analysis of gene expression patterns, total RNA was extracted from cerebellum. Changes in chromatin conformation, which are indicative of stress response and genotoxic effects, were measured by the method of anomalous viscosity time dependencies (AVTD). DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Effects of MW exposure were observed on neither conformation of chromatin nor DNA DSBs. Gene expression profiles were obtained by Affymetrix U34 GeneChips representing 8800 rat genes and analyzed with the Affymetrix Microarray Suite (MAS) 5.0 software. In cerebellum from all exposed animals, 11 genes were upregulated in a range of 1.34-2.74 fold and one gene was downregulated 0.48-fold (P < .0025). The induced genes encode proteins with diverse functions including neurotransmitter regulation, blood-brain barrier (BBB), and melatonin production.

Introduction: In patients with craniectomy ventricular size and parenchymal abnormalities are reliably estimated by CCT or MRI. Both techniques are time consuming; CCT involves frequent radiation exposure. Measurement of ventricular sizes or parenchymal abnormalities by ultrasound sonography is rarely performed. Aim of the study: To compare data of measurements of the ventricular size and anatomic structures by ultrasound sonography and CCT in patients (n = 62) with craniectomy following traumatic or vascular accidents. Method(s): Transcranial Duplex sonography (Hitachi-EUB 5000+C; 5-2/Abdominal probe; 1.4 MHz) over the craniectomized hemisphere. Documentation of land marks such as alteration of parenchymal structure, extravascular blood accumulation, hygroma, ventricular diameter, midline shift. Data of ventricular diameter were correlated with measurements obtained by CCT. Result(s): Sonography of the brain's structures and vessels by ultrasound sonography provide sharp outlined pictures which can be compared to CCT imaging with high reliability. Aneurysms larger than 10 mm in diameter were identified in some cases. The correlation of the diameter of the ventricles of the craniectomized and the contralateral side between ultrasound measurement and CCT was high (correlation coeffizient 0.826 for the first and 0.959 for subsequent measurements). In repetitive studies of the ultrasound measurements over a few days (without repetitive CCT), the stability of the diameter was high. Alteration of the horizontal body position between zero and 45 degrees did not affect the diameter of the ventricles. Midline shifts were detected with high reliability. Quantitative measurement of the blood flow velocity in the large intracerebral vessels using the Doppler modus was possible. Summary: B-mode ultrasound measurements of the ventricular size, the parenchyma and of the blood flow velocity in patients with craniectomy deliver reliable quantitative results for clinical neurosurgical and neurological decisions and may economize indication for frequent CCT.",Excluded,0.10430856

In this study, we retrospectively examined the relationship of SVZ irradiation dose and survival in a large, homogeneous GBM patient cohort.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 200 GBM patients who had been treated at our institution with trimodal therapy (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) between 2009 and 2020. The SVZ was delineated, and dose-volume histograms were calculated and extracted. Tumors were classified according to their contact with the SVZ. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis, and univariable and multivariable Cox regression (MVA) were used to determine prognostic effects on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: Median PFS of the study group was 7.2 months; median OS was 15.1 months. In MVA (with mean dose to the ipsilateral SVZ as a continuous covariable), PFS was significantly lower for patients with a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) < 70% and without MGMT promoter methylation. Factors prognostic for shorter OS were old age, lower KPS, unmethylated MGMT status, SVZ contact and biopsy instead of subtotal- or gross total resection. There was no significant correlation between survival and SVZ dose.CONCLUSION: In this cohort, an increased mean dose to the ipsilateral or contralateral SVZ did not correlate with improved survival in irradiated GBM patients in MVA. Patients whose tumor directly involved the SVZ showed worse OS in MVA.",Excluded,0.9084494
330,"[Neuroradiological response criteria for malignant gliomas]. This article summarizes the new response criteria of the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group and the clinical implications. The RANO criteria represent an important step forward in the accurate assessment of response to therapy in patients with malignant gliomas, not only in clinical trials but also in daily practice. The introduction of new substances to glioma therapy, such as antiangiogenic drugs, has complicated the assessment of efficacy by MRI due to profound effects on the vascular biology of these tumors. Moreover new treatment modalities have increased the incidence and awareness of imaging phenomena, such as pseudoprogression and pseudoresponse, not only within clinical trials but also outside. In addition to MRI the new RANO criteria also take clinical parameters, such as steroid medication and neurological symptoms, into account. Thus both neuroradiologists and neurologists/neurooncologists need to be aware of and experienced in applying these criteria when treating patients with malignant gliomas to be able to correctly assess the response to therapy.",Excluded,0.10274983
331,"Dexamethasone-related adrenal insufficiency in patients with brain and skull base tumours. Purpose or Objective This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency in a cohort of patients with brain and skull base tumours and to identify factors which may predict its occurrence. Material and Methods Patients with brain or skull base tumours attending for a short synacthen test (SST) at a single institution between October 2010 and January 2014 were retrospectively identified. Baseline demographics and dexamethasone exposure was scrutinised. Fisher's Exact, Student's ttest, Mann-Whitney and the Kendall's tau-b were used to evaluate differences between patients who passed or failed the SST. Results Thirty-one of 51 patients with previous dexamethasone exposure failed their first SST (61%). Duration of and total exposure to dexamethasone was significantly different between pass and fail groups (p=0.001 and p=0.007 respectively). No significant relationship was demonstrated between age, gender, diagnosis or mean pituitary radiation dose and SST results. Receiver operator characteristic curves generated suggest both duration of and total exposure to dexamethasone are acceptable discriminators when predicting SST failure. These curves generate values of 78 days and 171 milligram days respectively with optimum sensitivity (i.e. ability to detect SST failures.) Conclusion These values may be used clinically to identify patients at higher risk of adrenal suppression who require empirical hydrocortisone pending formal testing of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.",Excluded,0.103249386

Light regulates the c-fos protooncogene in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), with increased expression after animals are exposed to light during the dark phase of a light-dark cycle or during the subjective night in constant darkness. To determine whether this phase-dependent activation of c-Fos persists in an acute in vitro preparation, we prepared horizontal slices of hamster ventral hypothalamus, electrically stimulated the still-attached optic nerves, recorded the resulting evoked potentials in the SCN, and examined c-Fos protein levels in the nucleus by immunohistochemistry. The number of SCN cells labeled for immunoreactive c-Fos was significantly increased in slices stimulated during projected night, but not during projected day, compared to matched, sham-stimulated control slices. These results imply that the phase-dependent mechanism that gates c-Fos photoinduction in vivo is intrinsic to SCN tissue, and they suggest that an in vitro slice preparation will provide a useful model for dissecting the responsible signal transduction elements.",Excluded,0.10498645

In the past it has not been possible to measure optically the membrane potential of cells and collections of cells that are either naturally photosensitive or that can be activated by photolyzable caged transmitter molecules. This paper reports on a unique application of nonlinear optics that can monitor the potential of cellular membranes with a near-infrared source. Among many other singular advantages, this nonlinear optical approach to measuring membrane potential does not activate light sensitive cells or cell suspensions and cellular networks surrounded with photolyzable molecules. To demonstrate this capability we show that the technique can be applied to living photoreceptor cells that are very sensitive to visible light. These cells are ideal for characterizing such a new technique, not only because of their unmatched sensitivity to light, but also because their electrical responses have been extensively characterized (Minks and Selinger, 1992).",Excluded,0.1032981

A nonfluoroscopic temporomandibular joint arthrographic technique is contrasted with a more widely employed fluoroscopically guided technique. The nonfluoroscopic technique uses a posterior approach to joint injection, as contrasted with the lateral injection approach of the fluoroscopically guided technique. The advantages of the nonfluoroscopic technique are less radiation dose to the patient, less expensive and less sophisticated imaging equipment, and less potential for neurovascular trauma. The fluoroscopic technique offers greater control of the procedure, less patient and operator time, and the capability for a dynamic videofluoroscopic study. Both techniques appear to be safe and efficacious. Differences in anatomy, imaging modalities, patient radiation exposure, and potential complications are also discussed as part of this comparison.

336,"Melatonin receptor density in Area X of European starlings is correlated with reproductive state and is unaffected by plasma melatonin concentration. Several of the song control nuclei of songbirds, including HVc (higher vocal center) and Area X, contain melatonin receptor (MelR). In laboratory-housed male starlings, the densities of MelR in Area X change markedly according to reproductive state. MelR are down-regulated when starlings are photostimulated (in full breeding condition) and are subsequently up-regulated when starlings become photorefractory (reproductively quiescent). However, seasonal regulation of MelR densities in Area X has only been investigated during the light phase of the light:dark cycle. Variation in MelR densities are physiologically relevant only if they also occur during the dark phase, when melatonin is present in the circulation. Brains from male starlings that were in different reproductive states but exposed to the same 18L:6D photoperiod were collected during either the mid-point of the light phase or the dark phase. Melatonin receptor distribution was assessed in vitro by 125Iodomelatonin (IMEL) receptor autoradiography. All photostimulated birds exhibited down-regulation of MelR in Area X, and all photorefractory birds exhibited high MelR density in Area X, regardless of time of sampling or plasma melatonin concentration. Thus, within each reproductive state, MelR density in Area X did not differ over the course of a circadian cycle. The functional significance of seasonal regulation of MelR in this song control nucleus remains unclear, but it is likely to involve a release of cellular inhibition by melatonin during photostimulation, with possible consequences for song learning, memory consolidation or regulation of the context of song production.",Excluded,0.10331855
337,"Dopamine releasing effect of phenylbiguanide in rat striatal slices. The present study explored the mechanisms underlying the dopamine releasing effect of phenylbiguanide, a compound commonly used as a 5-HT3 receptor agonist. Phenylbiguanide, and also serotonin and 2-methyl-serotonin, enhanced the outflow of radioactivity from superfused rat striatal slices preloaded with [3H]dopamine. The presence of the dopamine uptake blocker nomifensin prevented the increase in outflow. The effect of phenylbiguanide was not antagonized by 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, did not require the presence of Ca2+ in the superfusion buffer, and also occurred in reserpinized preparations with depleted dopamine stores. Phenylbiguanide caused a greater shift in the distribution of superfusate radioactivity from DOPAC to dopamine than did nomifensin. All these results are in agreement with an exchange mechanism by which phenylbiguanide promotes the efflux of dopamine by operation of the uptake carrier in the reversed direction. In consonance, phenylbiguanide, and also serotonin and 2-methyl-serotonin, inhibited the binding of [3H]CFT to dopamine uptake sites, although the rank order for promoting outflow, serotonin greater than phenylbiguanide greater than 2-methyl-serotonin, differed from that for inhibiting [3H]CFT binding to dopamine uptake sites, 2-methylserotonin approximately serotonin greater than phenylbiguanide. The present results raised the possibility that phenylbiguanide has an additional activity in releasing vesicular dopamine into the cytoplasmic pool.",Excluded,0.10470426

339,"Advanced radiation therapy plan for glm based on FMRI. Purpose: Following radical radiotherapy (RT), high graDe gliomas such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) frequently recur within the high dose volume and it is plausible that conventional planning margins might be reduced without a loss of local tumour control. Akin to the current evaluation of reduction in the dose delivered to the hippocampal and limbic systems to reduce radiationrelated memory impairment, other uninvolved critical functional cerebral areas should be spared to minimise the potential acute and late toxicities of radiation therapy. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of speech centre localisation using functional MRI (fMRI) on the RT planning process in GBM. Materials: Language function was activated in a 68-year old male with a right fronto-parietal GBM using a 'word generation' task. Block designed blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI was applied (1.5 T Siemens Avanto scanner) during lingual stimulation [1]. BOLD-clusters were assessed individually for anatomical localization. fMRI was performed using EPI sequence and T1-weighted anatomical 3D VIBE sequence was used for functional image analysis and overlay [1]. The functional image analysis and overlay procedures were performed using BrainVoyager (BrainInnovationBV, Maastricht, The Netherlands). A CT scan (Siemens Open Sensation) was performed to delineate the radiation target volume and organs at risk (OAR) (Fig 1A). The fusion of the 3-D anatomical and functional datasets (CT+fMRI) as well as the segmentation of the radiation target volume was achieved using Siemens Oncology workstation (Fig. 1B). The speech centres were defined as OARs in the IMRT planning process (mean 45 Gy, max. 50 Gy) (Fig. 1C). The treatment plan (Pinnacle 8.0m TPS, Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands) was not used clinically and the patient was informed. Result(s): Speech activation areas and the GBM (as defined on the T1 MRI images) could be visualised separately. The plan did not compromise any other constraint and spared the critical structures. The mean and maximum doses to the PTV (60 Gy prescribed to 100%) were 61.97 Gy and 69.47 Gy respectively. Broca's area was partially within the PTV, however the mean and maximum doses to Wernicke's area were 36 Gy and 52.81 Gy (Fig. 1C). Figure 1. A) CT scan, B) Broca's and Wernicke's areas as detected by fMRI and C) axial slice through radiation treatment plan. (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): Our 3-D CT/fMRI fusion protocol provides a method to localise the speech centres and thus to define them as OARs for clinical radiotherapy planning. This novel technique enables the first steps towards the individualisation of radiotherapy treatment planning for selected patients with glioma, where the tumour does not overlap the speech areas.",Excluded,0.10290626

We studied central cannabinoid CB1 receptors in a schizophrenic patient using the pyrazole derivative AM281 labelled with the positron-emitting nuclide iodine-124. A dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) acquisition with simultaneous blood sampling was performed up to 1.5 h post-injection. The classical Logan plot analysis was applied to generate a three-dimensional map of distribution volume (DV). The map was spatially normalised into the Montreal Neurological Institute stereotactic space. Using a volume of interest (VOI) template, mean values of DV were extracted from multiple grey matter regions and white matter (as a reference). As a measure of regional receptor availability, ratios of DV in grey matter to DV in white matter minus one (DVR-1) were calculated. The highest receptor binding was observed in the striatum and the pallidum (DVR-1: 0.35-0.37). Binding in basal ganglia regions was lower on the left than the right side. Moderately high binding was seen in the frontal cortex (0.22), the temporal cortex (0.18) and the cerebellum (0.15). In conclusion, 124I-AM281 PET can be used to reveal areas with prominent CB1 receptor binding. Nevertheless, limited image contrast and relatively high radiation exposure (physical half-life of 124I: 4 days) have to be taken into account. Asymmetric receptor binding may possibly reflect pathologic changes in schizophrenia.",Excluded,0.10264969
342,"Planning of radiotherapy with PET: Volumes only?. Aim: We assess the percentage of cases in which findings of distant disease through 18F-FDG PET/CT for radiotherapy planning lead to changes in the modality and/or intent of the treatment, or change in stage IV. Material(s) and Method(s): All the studies derived from the Radiotherapy department were retrospectively analysed. Those performed for radiotherapy planning were selected. Cases with distant disease findings were assessed, investigating changes in the modality or intent of treatment and change in stage IV. One thousand four hundred seventy six studies were derived from the Radiotherapy department between April/09 and December/13. Three hundred and seventy three (25,3%) were performed for radiotherapy planning (267 males and 106 females, mean age 68.2 years). The intention of radiotherapy was for radical treatment planning. Result(s): In 45 of these studies (12%) there were previously not suspected findings that suggested an upstage of the patients to a clinical stage IV. The unexpected disease was located more frequently in bone (12 patients), followed by lung (9 patients), liver (10), distant adenopathy (6 patients), brain (4 patients), adrenal glands (4 patients), spleen (1 patient) and multiple progression (1 patient).In twenty-six (26/45, 7%) of these patients the findings of 18F-FDG PET/CT were confirmed as true positive for distant metastasis with complementary examinations. In sixteen (16/26) of them the modality of treatment was changed. In ten of them (10/26) the intent of treatment was changed from curative to palliative. In three patients a second primary tumour was confirmed.In remaining sixteen (16/45) patients the results of 18F-FDG PET/CT could not be initially confirmed. The confirmation was made by monitoring progression in eleven patients, one patient remained with stable disease and four patients died without being able to confirm the findings. Conclusion(s): 18F-FDG PET/CT studies in radiotherapy planning improve the staging of patients, leading to an upstage in a significant number of patients. Based upon the findings of 18F-FDG PET/CT, the modality or the intent of treatment may radically change, (making unnecessary radiation) or changing the intent to palliative.",Excluded,0.10414659
343,"TrpC3/C7 and Slo2.1 are molecular targets for metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling in rat striatal cholinergic interneurons. Large aspiny cholinergic interneurons provide the sole source of striatal acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter critical for basal ganglia function; these tonically active interneurons receive excitatory inputs from corticostriatal glutamatergic afferents that act, in part, via metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). We combined electrophysiological recordings in brain slices with molecular neuroanatomy to identify distinct ion channel targets for mGluR1/5 receptors in striatal cholinergic interneurons: transient receptor potential channel 3/7 (TrpC3/C7) and Slo2.1. In recordings obtained with methanesulfonate-based internal solutions, we found an mGluR-activated current with voltage-dependent and pharmacological properties reminiscent of TrpC3 and TrpC7; expression of these TrpC subunits in cholinergic interneurons was verified by combined immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, and modulation of both TrpC channels was reconstituted in HEK293 (human embryonic kidney 293) cells cotransfected with mGluR1 or mGluR5. With a chloride-based internal solution, mGluR agonists did not activate interneuron TrpC-like currents. Instead, a time-dependent, outwardly rectifying K(+) current developed after whole-cell access, and this Cl(-)-activated K(+) current was strongly inhibited by volatile anesthetics and mGluR activation. This modulation was recapitulated in cells transfected with Slo2.1, a Na(+)- and Cl(-)-activated K(+) channel, and Slo2.1 expression was confirmed histochemically in striatal cholinergic interneurons. By using gramicidin perforated-patch recordings, we established that the predominant agonist-activated current was TrpC-like when ambient intracellular chloride was preserved, although a small K(+) current contribution was observed in some cells. Together, our data indicate that mGluR1/5-mediated glutamatergic excitation of cholinergic interneurons is primarily a result of activation of TrpC3/TrpC7-like cationic channels; under conditions when intracellular NaCl is elevated, a Slo2.1 background K(+) channel may also contribute.",Excluded,0.10341518

The specific binding of several radioligands previously shown to label the dopamine transporter was determined in an irradiated striatal membrane preparation. The apparent target size of the 1-[1-(2-[3H]benzo[b]thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine site was approximately 98 kDa. However, the apparent target size of the ""cocaine binding site,"" as measured with the cocaine analogue 2 beta-[3H]carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane in the same assays, was approximately 140 kDa. Radiation inactivation of the binding of other ligands (GBR-12935 and mazindol) led to target size estimates in the same range (94 kDa and 133 kDa, respectively). All of these target sizes are significantly larger than the estimate of 70 kDa derived from the deduced amino acid sequence for the cloned dopamine reuptake transporter cDNA. Larger target sizes than expected have also been reported for ligand binding to the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter and glucose transporter. The estimated sizes for the ligand binding site(s) associated with the dopamine transporter protein are difficult to reconcile with a single transporter protein of 70 kDa.

PURPOSE: To evaluate stochastic and deterministic risks associated with neurointerventional procedures for the patient.METHODS: Eight neurovascular interventional procedures were evaluated to determine the entrance skin dose and effective dose for the patient. Dosimetry was done with thermoluminescence dosimeters. The highest dose on the patient's head was recorded as the maximum entrance skin dose. The equivalent dose was obtained by conversion of the dose-area product using published conversion tables.RESULTS: The maximum entrance skin dose varied from 129 to 1335 mGy. The mean effective dose was 1.67 mSv with a range of 0.44 to 3.44 mSv. No deterministic effect has been encountered. Stochastic risk linked to the highest effective dose value was approximately one death by fatal cancer for every 6000 procedures, according to the new International Commission on Radiological Protection coefficient.CONCLUSIONS: Because no deterministic effect has been detected, and stochastic risks were very low, radiation hazard to the patient is a minor consideration in deciding whether to undertake a neurointerventional procedure.",Excluded,0.10366187

BACKGROUND: New immunomodulatroy agents, like ipilimumab, showed promising activity in brain metastases (BM). However, little is known about the inflammatory response in BM and new insights are needed to further guide the development of treatment strategies. METHOD(S): We investigated 17 human autoptic tissue specimens of BM from breast cancer (n = 3), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; n = 5), small cell lung cancer (SCLC; n = 3) and melanoma (n = 6). Immunohistochemical staining for a comprehensive panel of 21 inflammation-associated markers was performed. Results were quantified by manual counting of the various cell populations in three areas of 0.5 mm2 (intratumoral, peritumoral, control region). RESULT(S): Profound microglia activation with marked peritumoral accumulation and some intratumoral infiltration of HLA-DR-positive microglia/macrophages was found. A high proportion of these cells showed strong immunoreactivity for phagocytosis associated markers and MHC class 1, while a smaller subgroup of cells expressed molecules involved in radical production (inducible nitric oxide synthase or NADPH oxidases). Only few B- and T-lymphocytes were observed in and around BM. The number of CD8-positive T-cells was not correlated to MHC class 1 expression on microglia/macrophages or tumor cells. Melanoma BM had significantly less dense peritumoral microglia infiltrates than NSCLC BM. The inflammatory pattern was independent from treatment of patients with glucocorticoids or radiation. CONCLUSION(S): Inflammatory reaction to BM is mainly characterized by activation of microglia/macrophages and shows pronounced upregulation of markers involved in phagocytosis, but seems to be insufficient in activating T-cell response.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) typically presents at an advanced stage, which is often felt to be incurable, and such patients are usually treated with a palliative approach. Accumulating retrospective and prospective clinical evidence, including a recently completed randomized trial, support the existence of an oligometastatic disease state wherein select individuals with advanced NSCLC may experience historically unprecedented prolonged survival with aggressive local treatments, consisting of radiotherapy and/or surgery, to limited sites of metastatic disease. This is reflected in the most recent AJCC staging subcategorizing metastatic disease into intra-thoracic (M1a), a single extra thoracic site (M1b), and more diffuse metastases (M1c). In the field of radiation oncology, recent technological advances have allowed for the delivery of very high, potentially ablative, doses of radiotherapy to both intra- and extra-cranial disease sites, referred to as stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiotherapy (or SABR), in much shorter time periods compared to conventional radiation and with minimal associated toxicity. At the same time, significant improvements in systemic therapy, including platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, molecular agents targeting oncogene-addicted NSCLC, and immunotherapy in the form of checkpoint inhibitors, have led to improved control of micro-metastatic disease and extended survival sparking newfound interest in combining these agents with ablative local therapies to provide additive, and in the case of radiation and immunotherapy, potentially synergistic, effects in order to further improve progression-free and overall survival. Currently, despite the tantalizing potential associated with aggressive local therapy in the setting of oligometastatic NSCLC, well-designed prospective randomized controlled trials sufficiently powered to detect and measure the possible added benefit afforded by this approach are desperately needed.

PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that the extent of outer retina uptake of manganese, measured noninvasively with manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI), is a quantitative biomarker of photoreceptor ion channel regulation by visual cycle activity.METHODS: Four groups of animals were studied: control rats adapted to three different background light intensities, dark-adapted control mice systemically pretreated with retinylamine, and dark-adapted mice with a nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the RPE65 gene (RPE65(rd12)) with and without systemic 11-cis-retinal pretreatment. In all cases, rodents were anesthetized and studied with MEMRI 4 hours after manganese administration IP. Central retinal thickness and intraretinal ion channel regulation were measured from the MEMRI data.RESULT: No differences (P>0.05) in retinal thickness were noted within any arm of this study. In rats, manganese uptake was inversely proportional to the background light intensity in the outer retina but not in the inner retina. Specific inhibition at the level of RPE65 activity, either acutely with retinylamine or chronically in RPE65(rd12) mice, similarly reduced (P<0.05) outer retinal manganese uptake compared with that in control mice. In RPE65(rd12) mice, outer retinal manganese uptake returned to normal (P>0.05) after 11-cis retinal treatment. Inner retinal uptake was supernormal (P<0.05) in retinylamine-treated mice but normal in untreated or 11-cis treated RPE65(rd12) mice.CONCLUSIONS: The present data support measuring the extent of manganese uptake in the outer retina as an analytic noninvasive metric of visual cycle regulation of photoreceptor ion channel activity in vivo.",Excluded,0.10596427
356,"Tumor resistance to radiotherapy is triggered by an ATM/TAK1-dependent-increased expression of the cellular prion protein. In solid cancers, high expression of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is associated with stemness, invasiveness, and resistance to chemotherapy, but the role of PrPC in tumor response to radiotherapy is unknown. Here, we show that, in neuroblastoma, breast, and colorectal cancer cell lines, PrPC expression is increased after ionizing radiation (IR) and that PrPC deficiency increases radiation sensitivity and decreases radiation-induced radioresistance in tumor cells. In neuroblastoma cells, IR activates ATM that triggers TAK1-dependent phosphorylation of JNK and subsequent activation of the AP-1 transcription factor that ultimately increases PRNP promoter transcriptional activity through an AP-1 binding site in the PRNP promoter.

357,"Clinical Findings in Dogs Trained for Awake-MRI. Training dogs for awake-MRI began in 2012 for the study of canine cognition. Although originally envisioned as a research technique to understand the neural mechanisms of canine cognitive function, its potential as a new diagnostic clinical tool has become apparent. A high-quality structural scan of the brain can be acquired without sedation or anesthesia in as little as 30 s in a well-trained dog. This has opened the possibility of longitudinal imaging of CNS disease with MRI both as a means of monitoring treatment and potentially as a surveillance tool for inflammatory and neoplastic brain diseases in high-risk breeds. This same training can be used to image other body regions, such as the abdomen, enabling clinicians to screen for abdominal disease using cross sectional imaging without the need for anesthesia and without exposing the patient to ionizing radiation. We present four examples of dogs trained for awake-MRI who developed: (1) nasal carcinoma; (2) brain tumor; (3) abdominal lipoma; (4) idiopathic epilepsy.",Excluded,0.1028487

Changes in normal rat brain were studied acutely, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following interstitial brachytherapy with high-activity 125I seeds. An 80-Gy radiation dose was administered to an area with a 5.5-mm radius. Effects were measured with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (with and without gadolinium enhancement), leakage of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), electron microscopy, and light microscopy. Significant histological damage was seen at radiation doses above 295 Gy, and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier was observed only in tissue receiving a dose of 165 Gy or greater. Blood-brain barrier breakdown increased up to the 6-month time point, and thereafter appeared to stabilize or decrease. The area of blood-brain barrier disruption indicated by gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging was greater than that indicated by leakage of HRP.",Included,0.9235999
359,"Spine Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Patients with Metastatic Thyroid Cancer: Secondary Analysis of Phase I/II Trials. Background: Metastatic deposits to the spine in thyroid cancer patients represent the most common site of bone involvement and can contribute to pain, neurologic deficits, and death. This study sought to determine the efficacy and safety of spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS) for thyroid cancer patients. Method(s): Thyroid cancer patients with spine metastases were selected and analyzed from a cohort of patients who were prospectively enrolled in two single-institution Phase I/II studies. SSRS was delivered in single or multi-fraction schedules. Dose regimens ranged from 16-18 Gy in one fraction to 27-30 Gy in three to five fractions. Toxicity was graded according to the NCI-CTC toxicity scale. Local control was determined by serial post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging scans showing no evidence of progressive disease. Patients were followed until date of death or date of last known visit for survival analyses. Local control and overall survival rates were carried out using Kaplan-Meier estimates. The log-rank test was used to assess the equality of the survivor function across groups. A p-value of <=0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Result(s): A total of 27 spine lesions were treated in 23 patients over a six-year period. Median follow-up was 28.9 months (range 5-93 months). Local control was 88% at two years and 79% at three years. In patients with progressive disease following conventional radiation therapy, local control for salvage SSRS remained at 88% at three years. Patients requiring upfront surgical intervention and treated with adjuvant SSRS achieved sustained control rates of 86% at three years. Overall survival rates were 85% and 67% at one and two years, respectively. In patients classified with oligoprogression and controlled extra-spinal disease, overall survival was significantly higher than those with evidence of systemic progression (81% vs. 45% at two years; p = 0.01). Univariate analysis did not show significant correlations between local control and age, systemic disease status, prior <sup>131</sup>I therapy, SSRS fraction regimen, spine location, histological subtype, or time from initial diagnosis to evidence of spinal metastasis. No patient experienced any grade 3-5 toxicity. Pain flare was reported in 30% of patients, with only three patients (13%) requiring narcotics or short-course steroids. There was no evidence of vertebral body fracture in any patient that achieved local control in the treated area. Conclusion(s): SSRS for thyroid metastases as a primary or adjuvant/salvage therapy is well tolerated and yields high rates of local control. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",Excluded,0.11532381

362,"Refresher course: Ultrasound guided chronic pain management: Evidence and practice. Ultrasound has become a popular tool utilized in the performance of chronic pain interventions. Traditionally, procedures in pain medicine were performed using anatomic landmarks, fluoroscopy or CT scan. While the semodalities continue to be utilized, there has been a tremendous growth in the use of ultrasound by pain practitioners. Interventional techniques for acute and chronic pain management have traditionally performed upon a combination of anatomical landmarks, electron eurostimulation or imaging. All this techniques are usefull but, ENS has no help in avoiding puncture of vessels, pleura or other structure. Fluoroscopy is effective for visualization of bony structures but not soft tissues. It thus has limitations when performing procedures for peripheral procedures. While CT scan is better than fluoroscopy for visualization of bony structures and soft tissue, it can be cost prohibitive and is associated with significant radiation exposure to the patient and practitioner Most pain management guidelines have moved towards recommending image guidance such as ultrasound, fluoroscopy or CT scan for interventional procedures. This is largely due to the increased accuracy, reliability (precision) and safety associated with structure visualization. Ultrasound can identify other structures asmuscles, ligaments, vessels, joint and bony surfaces. An ultrasound machine is affordable, portable and does not diffuse radiation, its use has not be associated with any risk both for patients and practitioners. The image that we can see is real time and can be performed continuously along the procedure Ultrasound can be implemented in office-based practice for diagnostic and therapeutic injections. Mergin experience from various specialities seems to be a way for forward. Musculoskeletal US experts (radiologists, rheumatologists) may help to develop skills in joint injections. Trigger point injections (including Botulinum Toxin A) are not longer to be blind but specific group of muscle can be targeted and potential complications (pneumothorax, intraperitoneal, intravaascular injections) avoided. Anesthetists with experience with peripheral nerve blocks under ultrasound guidance naturally progress to blocks in field of chronic pain. Chronic pain procedures may include nerve blocks, many spinal approches, including epidurals, selective nerve block, facet joints, medial branch blocks and sympathetic blocks. More recently ultrasound guidance has been used as aid placement of peripheral neuromodulation electrodes. What limitations. High frequency probe providing high resolution pictures but will not penetrate deep tissue. Low frequency probe penetrates deeper but quality of pictures is degradeed. Structures like bones are not easily penetrated by ultrasound wave producing scattering or artifacts. Spine procedures: The primary advantage of ultrasonography (besides no radiation exposure) is direct visualization of soft tissue structures, it is particularly beneficial in cervical spine injections, where the multitude of blood vessels and other vital soft tissue structures make this area particularly vulnerable to injury if only fluoroscopy-guided injections are used. Ultrasound is an excellent tool in ""visualizing"" and, hence, ""avoiding"" vascular injury during cervical spine procedures, whereas contrast fluoroscopy can only ""detect"" when the tip of the needle is intravascular. One should be mindful that fluoroscopy may not detect that the needle has already traversed a vessel on its way to the target, whereas ultrasound can avoid this. Ultrasound guided lumbar intra-articular and medial branch block was compared to the most commonly used fluoroscopically guided approach. Very good result were obtained with US technique but limitations also exist when compared to fluoroscopically based technique. These limitiations are: obese patients, chllenge in detecting intravascular injection at such a depth, the possible need for a larger-gauge needle to improve visibility[1]. Thus despite the increasing number of paper published no recomandations can be given at this time if US is superior to fluoroscopy. On the contrary third occipital nerve block under fluoroscopy has a false positive rate of 38% and accurate needle placement up to 82% has been achieved with US guidance[2]. Also US guided stellate ganglion block helps in decreasing complications. With the anatomical landmarks trechnique several side effects or complications can occur. Puncture of the oesophagus leading to mediastinitis or carotid artery or other thyroids vessels puncture are serous complications. US guidance increases the incidence of successful sympathetic block and lowers the incidence of hoarseness associated with local anesthetic injections above the prevertebral fascia.[3] US guidance is very helpfull in border nerve syndromes (genitofemoral, iliinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves) where anatomical landmarks are confusing. Anatomical variability of the course of this nerves and distributiona of the sensory innervated skin area are very high. US helps in needle visualisation and makes anatomy more predictable.[4] In trunk pain US helps to visualise ribs, pleura, muscle layers. US makes the block easier and safer. In other sitution as pudendal neuralgia diagnosis is primarily a clinical one, confirmed by a diagnostic block. Tha interligamentous plane is the key to local anesthetic placement. US helps in real time visualisation of needle placement and confirmation of an injectate sperad within the interlegamentous plane. Almost 100% block success has been achieved by this technique and by identifyng pudendal artery and depositing local anesthetic solution media to the artery[5] US was considered a standard tool also for musculoskeletal pain. All joint injection can better performed under US guidance.[6] Ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve stimulation avoids the invasiveness of electrode placement via an open procedure while providing excellent pain relief. There are limitations of the percutaneous approach when navigating close to large blood vessels, a situation more appropriately managed with open peripheral nerve stimulator placement. Ultrasound-guided placement may be considered for patients receiving peripheral nerve stimulators placed within the deep tissues, and not easily placed in a blind fashion.[7] Conclusion(s): US systems are more available and cheap these days. Transportable devices give high resolution and quality pictures. This device is available in almost every hospital. Potential advantages of ultrasound are: no hazard of radiation exposure, it could be done in every position, visualization of nerves and surrounding structures: vessels, muscles, bone and visceral pleura, lung, peritoneum, bowel, diagnostic recognizing anatomical variability and pathology real time image of needle, needle nerve contact and inject it spread, reduce complication: nerve injury, vessels puncture, pneumothorax etc., higher success rate, quicker onset, reduces performance time, reduce volume of local anesthetic. A problem with the application of ultrasound in chronic pain interventions is that randomised controlled trials may not be ethical while comparing to fluoroscopy or CT. Wide world use of ultrasound guidance into clinical practice has to come as its use a tool, from clinical outcome studies. Its further development will depends on training and education.

363,"Light-evoked disc shedding by rod photoreceptors in vitro: relationship to medium bicarbonate concentration. Although studies on the control of photoperiod-related shedding by rod photoreceptors in frogs suggested that the mechanisms which initiate shedding are intrinsic features of the eye, attempts to observe light-evoked shedding in opened eye cups in balanced salt solutions have been unsuccessful. We have examined disc shedding in eye cups kept in a complex tissue culture medium. Eye cups were prepared in red light from dark-adapted animals or in white light from constant light-treated animals. Light-evoked shedding did not occur in the standard medium with -20 mM sodium bicarbonate, but a large light-evoked response was consistently seen when medium bicarbonate was raised to 030 mM. In high-bicarbonate medium, light-evoked shedding was comparable in magnitude, size distribution of phagosomes, and time course to similar responses observed in intact animals. Preliminary analysis of culture conditions which support shedding suggests that bicarbonate ion concentration is of critical importance. However, lack of light-evoked shedding in a high-bicarbonate Ringer solution suggests that some additional unidentified factor(s) in the complex medium is also necessary. The data indicate that both light- and dark-dependent processes involved in the control of photoperiod-related shedding are sustained in appropriate culture medium.",Excluded,0.102086045

366,"Comprehensive analysis of the role of DNA repair gene polymorphisms on risk of glioma. Much of the variation in inherited risk of glioma is likely to be explained by combinations of common low risk variants. The established relationship between glioma risk and exposure to ionizing radiation led us to examine whether variants in the DNA repair genes contribute to disease susceptibility. We evaluated 1127 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) supplemented with 388 putative functional SNPs to capture most of the common variation in 136 DNA repair genes, in five unique case-control series from four different countries (1013 cases, 1016 controls). We identified 16 SNPs associated with glioma risk at the 1% significance level. The highest association observed across the five independent case-control datasets involved rs243356, which maps to intron 3 of CHAF1A (trend odds ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval 1.14-1.54; P = 0.0002; false-positive report probability = 0.055, based on a prior probability of 0.01).

371,"More movement with evaluating colonic transit in humans. BACKGROUND: Colonic functions (ie, absorption of fluids and electrolytes, digestion of selected nutrients, harbor for microbes, and elimination of excreta) necessitate complex patterns of storage and transit. Indeed, colonic transit accounts for a major part of the mouth-to-anus transit time. Colonic transit assessments are useful for understanding the pathophysiology of disease, the pharmacodynamic effects of new medications and to diagnose slow transit constipation. Currently, radiopaque markers, scintigraphy, and a colonic pH-pressure capsule are used to measure overall colonic transit. Radioopaque markers, scintigraphy, and the electromagnetic capsule, which is a newer technique, also evaluate regional colonic transit. The pH-pressure capsule also measures colonic pressures. Magnetic resonance imaging and a radio-frequency identification-based device are evolving methods for assessing colonic transit.PURPOSE: This mini-review, which accompanies a study evaluating the assessment of colon transit with the electromagnetic capsule, evaluates and compares existing and evolving methods for evaluating colonic transit in humans (Neurogastroenterol Motil. 2018; in press). In addition to overall and regional colonic transit, the electromagnetic capsule evaluates colonic motor patterns without radiation exposure. These patterns are summarized by analyzing the characteristics (ie, distance and velocity) of discrete antegrade and retrograde capsule movements as they travel in the colon. However, the electromagnetic capsule does not measure pressure or colonic wall movement (ie, contractions). The motor patterns identified by this capsule should be compared with motor patterns identified with manometry. The next challenge is to harness different techniques to evaluate the relationships between colonic pressures and transit or, even better, the trifecta of colonic contractions, pressure events, and transit.",Excluded,0.10504397
372,"The functional synergism of microRNA clustering provides therapeutically relevant epigenetic interference in glioblastoma. MicroRNA deregulation is a consistent feature of glioblastoma, yet the biological effect of each single gene is generally modest, and therapeutically negligible. Here we describe a module of microRNAs, constituted by miR-124, miR-128 and miR-137, which are co-expressed during neuronal differentiation and simultaneously lost in gliomagenesis. Each one of these miRs targets several transcriptional regulators, including the oncogenic chromatin repressors EZH2, BMI1 and LSD1, which are functionally interdependent and involved in glioblastoma recurrence after therapeutic chemoradiation. Synchronizing the expression of these three microRNAs in a gene therapy approach displays significant anticancer synergism, abrogates this epigenetic-mediated, multi-protein tumor survival mechanism and results in a 5-fold increase in survival when combined with chemotherapy in murine glioblastoma models. These transgenic microRNA clusters display intercellular propagation in vivo, via extracellular vesicles, extending their biological effect throughout the whole tumor.

373,"Amaranthus paniculatus (Linn.) improves learning after radiation stress. Brain is highly susceptible to oxidative damage due to its high utilization of oxygen and rather poorly developed antioxidative defense mechanism. Free radicals formation is greatly augmented during ionizing radiation exposure, which causes damage in cerebellum responsible for locomotor activity. Amaranthus paniculatus (Linn.) having high content of beta-carotene (about 15 mg/100g), ascorbic acid, Vitamin C and folate, may prove efficient antioxidants. To evaluate its antioxidative efficacy, healthy Swiss albino mice from an inbred colony were selected and divided into three groups having equal number of male and female in each group. All of these animals were initially trained in Hebb William's Maze, model D(1). After initial training of 10 days, two groups were supplemented with methanolic extract of A. paniculatus (Linn.) at a dose of 600 and 800 mg/kg bw per day, respectively for 15 days. One group without any treatment served as normal. It has been observed that mice, supplemented with extract took lesser time to reach goal than normal (without any treatment). Furthermore after supplementation of Amaranthus, followed by exposure to 9 Gy of gamma radiation by 60Co beam therapy unit, the survived mice took lesser time to reach to their goals than those without plant extract. Control mice (not supplemented with AE extract) showed continuous decline in their learning performance. Mice of Control group died within 12 days after exposure. Irradiated males try to recover from 10th day onwards but they died up to day 12. But in Experimental mice (AE treated), after initial decline in learning ability after exposure, recovery was noticed and not only this 70% of them survived beyond the observation period. Besides male mice showed faster learning ability as compared to females in all groups. After irradiation too, males took lesser time to reach to goals. Learning in all the groups before exposure has been much faster in between 9 and 15 days. After radiation, however it was followed by a sudden spurt and delayed learning response up to 12 days. Recovery was greater in males than females in treated groups. Recovery was greater in males of 600 mg/kg bw per day than other groups.

In vitro studies found that abundant of NO was produced in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and protein nitration was increased in PC12 cells within a simulated microgravity rotating wall bioreactor high aspect ratio vessel system or clinostat system. In the present study, we observed the change of redox status in SH-SY5Y cells after parabolic flight, and studied the effects of key redox molecule, thioredoxin (TRX), during the altered gravity. SH-SY5Y cells were divided into four groups: control cells, control cells transfected with TRX, flight cells and flight cells transfected with TRX. The expression levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TRX and thioredoxin reductase (TRXR) were observed by immunocytochemical method. It was shown that after parabolic flight, the staining of 3-NT and TRX were enhanced, while the expression level of TRXR was down-regulated compared with control. As for flight cells transfected with TRX, the staining of 3-NT and iNOS were weakened compared with flight cells.

Although brain tumours have been documented and recorded since the nineteenth century, 2016 marked 90 years since Percival Bailey and Harvey Cushing coined the term ""glioblastoma multiforme"". Since that time, although extensive developments in diagnosis and treatment have been made, relatively little improvement on prognosis has been achieved. The resilience of GBM thus makes treating this tumour one of the biggest challenges currently faced by neuro-oncology.

BACKGROUND: Simple resection of diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis of the ankle joint is associated with local recurrence rates as high as 50%. Thus, adjuvant treatment modalities, such as radiation or intra-articular isotope injection, are sometimes used after tumor resection. Our initial and highly satisfactory experience with the injection of radioactive yttrium 90 to treat pigmented villonodular synovitis of the ankle joint eroded with time so much so that we discontinued its use in the ankle and believe that it is important to alert our colleagues to the complications that we observed.METHODS: Between 1989 and 2006, we treated seven patients who had diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis of the ankle joint with subtotal synovectomy followed by intra-articular injection of 15 mCi of yttrium 90.RESULTS: Two of the study patients had full-thickness skin necrosis develop around the injection site, necessitating free muscle flap transfer within three months of treatment, and a third patient had development of a draining sinus that was associated with chronic severe pain. The other four patients reported pain after the injection that was reasonably controlled by the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. At the most recent follow-up evaluation, no study patient had recurrent disease.CONCLUSIONS: Because of the unacceptably high rate of serious complications associated with the injection of yttrium 90 into the ankle joint following subtotal synovectomy, we discontinued its use as a local adjuvant in the management of diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis of the ankle.",Excluded,0.10598688
378,"ATM kinase inhibition preferentially sensitizes p53-mutant glioma to ionizing radiation. PURPOSE: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal form of brain cancer with a median survival of only 12 to 15 months. Current standard treatment consists of surgery followed by chemoradiation. The poor survival of patients with GBM is due to aggressive tumor invasiveness, an inability to remove all tumor tissue, and an innate tumor chemo- and radioresistance. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is an excellent target for radiosensitizing GBM because of its critical role in regulating the DNA damage response and p53, among other cellular processes. As a first step toward this goal, we recently showed that the novel ATM kinase inhibitor KU-60019 reduced migration, invasion, and growth, and potently radiosensitized human glioma cells in vitro.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using orthotopic xenograft models of GBM, we now show that KU-60019 is also an effective radiosensitizer in vivo. Human glioma cells expressing reporter genes for monitoring tumor growth and dispersal were grown intracranially, and KU-60019 was administered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery or osmotic pump.RESULTS: Our results show that the combined effect of KU-60019 and radiation significantly increased survival of mice 2- to 3-fold over controls. Importantly, we show that glioma with mutant p53 is much more sensitive to KU-60019 radiosensitization than genetically matched wild-type glioma.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that an ATM kinase inhibitor may be an effective radiosensitizer and adjuvant therapy for patients with mutant p53 brain cancers.",Excluded,0.5699402

PURPOSE: A prospective study was designed to evaluate, whether multiplanar imaging with rotational digital subtraction angiography (R-DSA) could improve assessment of carotid artery bifurcation stenosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 45 patients with suspected stenosis of the ICA were examined with DSA in standard projections (0 degree-(45 degrees)-90 degrees) and additional R-DSA of each ICA from 0-90 degrees in 10 degrees steps. We compared imaging quality and degree of stenosis as well as exposure of the patients to radiation and contrast media.RESULTS: 79/82 R-DSA (96%) were suitable for evaluation of stenosis, 58/82 (70%) matched the quality standard of single projection DSA. Specificity and sensitivity of the R-DSA to diagnose high grade ACI stenosis were 100% and 94%, respectively. 7/79 R-DSA revealed a higher and 3/79 a lower degree of stenosis than the corresponding DSA. Regarding the degree of stenosis there was no significant difference between the two modalities (p > 0.05), but R-DSA detected 4 stenoses greater than 60% that were estimated to be lower than 60% by DSA. Radiation dose for R-DSA was equivalent to one DSA run (170 cGycm2). The average amount of contrast media (25 ml) was slightly higher than for 2-3 single-projection DSA (19.8 ml).CONCLUSIONS: R-DSA provides high quality imaging of the carotid bifurcation with multiplanar projections facilitating exact grading of vessel stenosis. The number of cases (n = 2) is to small to judge the value of R-DSA as to (tandem-) stenosis of the distal ICA. Still, diagnostic value and low radiation exposure justify the use of R-DSA as additional series to standard protocols.",Excluded,0.104750514

Method(s): <sup>11</sup>C-vorozole (111-296 MBq/subject) was injected intravenously in 13 men and 20 women (age range, 23-67 y). PET data were acquired over a 90-min period. Each subject had 4 scans, 2 per day separated by 2-6 wk, including brain and torso or pelvis scans. Young women were scanned at 2 discrete phases of the menstrual cycle (midcycle and late luteal). Men and postmenopausal women were also scanned after pretreatment with a clinical dose of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole. Time-activity curves were obtained, and standardized uptake values (SUV) were calculated for major organs including brain, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, muscle, bone, and male and female reproductive organs (penis, testes, uterus, ovaries). Organ and whole-body radiation exposures were calculated using OLINDA software. Result(s): Liver uptake was higher than uptake in any other organ but was not blocked by pretreatment with letrozole. Mean SUVs were higher in men than in women, and brain uptake was blocked by letrozole. Male brain SUVs were also higher than SUVs in any other organ (ranging from 0.48 +/- 0.05 in lungs to 1.5 +/- 0.13 in kidneys). Mean ovarian SUVs (3.08 +/- 0.7) were comparable to brain levels and higher than in any other organ. Furthermore, ovarian SUVs in young women around the time of ovulation (midcycle) were significantly higher than those measured in the late luteal phase, whereas aging and cigarette smoking reduced <sup>11</sup>C-vorozole uptake. Conclusion(s): PET with <sup>11</sup>C-vorozole is useful for assessing physiologic changes in estrogen synthesis capacity in the human body. Baseline levels in breasts, lungs, and bones are low, supporting further investigation of this tracer as a new tool for detection of aromatase-overexpressing primary tumors or metastases in these organs and optimization of treatment in cancer and other disorders in which aromatase inhibitors are useful.

381,"Differentiating embryonic stem-derived neural stem cells show a maturation-dependent pattern of voltage-gated sodium current expression and graded action potentials. A population of mouse embryonic stem (ES)-derived neural stem cells (named NS cells) that exhibits traits reminiscent of radial glia-like cell population and that can be homogeneously expanded in monolayer while remaining stable and highly neurogenic over multiple passages has been recently discovered. This novel population has provided a unique in vitro system in which to investigate physiological events occurring as stem cells lose multipotency and terminally differentiate. Here we analysed the timing, quality and quantity of the appearance of the excitability properties of differentiating NS cells which have been long-term expanded in vitro. To this end, we studied the biophysical properties of voltage-dependent Na(+) currents as an electrophysiological readout for neuronal maturation stages of differentiating NS cells toward the generation of fully functional neurons, since the expression of neuronal voltage-gated Na(+) channels is an essential hallmark of neuronal differentiation and crucial for signal transmission in the nervous system. Using the whole cell and single-channel cell-attached variations of the patch-clamp technique we found that the Na(+) currents in NS cells showed substantial electrophysiological changes during in vitro neuronal differentiation, consisting mainly in an increase of Na(+) current density and in a shift of the steady-state activation and inactivation curves toward more negative and more positive potentials respectively. The changes in the Na(+) channel system were closely related with the ability of differentiating NS cells to generate action potentials, and could therefore be exploited as an appropriate electrophysiological marker of ES-derived NS cells undergoing functional neuronal maturation.",Excluded,0.10243509

The degeneration of photoreceptors is a common hallmark of ocular diseases like retinitis pigmentosa (RP) or age-related macular degeneration (AMD). To experimentally induce photoreceptor degeneration, the light damage paradigm is frequently used. In this study we show that the exposure to high amounts of cool white light (10,000 lux, 1 h) resulted in a more than 11-fold higher apoptotic rate in the retina compared to light exposure with 5000 lux for 30 min. Consequently, exposure to intense light resulted in a significant downregulation of retinal mRNA expression levels of the reference genes Gapdh, Gnb2l, Rpl32, Rps9, Actb, Ubc or Tbp compared to untreated controls. Investigators performing light-induced photoreceptor degeneration should be aware of the fact that higher light intensities will result in a dysregulation of reference genes.",Excluded,0.10427936

During transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), controllable dose parameters are electrode number (typically 1 anode and 1 cathode), position, size, shape, and applied electric current. Because different electrode montages result in distinct brain current flow patterns across the brain, tDCS dose parameters can be adjusted, in an application-specific manner, to target or avoid specific brain regions. Though the tDCS electrode montage often follows basic rules of thumb (increased/decreased excitability ""under"" the anode/cathode electrode), computational forward models of brain current flow provide more accurate insight into detailed current flow patterns and, in some cases, can even challenge simplified electrode-placement assumptions. With the increased recognized value of computational forward models in informing tDCS montage design and interpretation of results, there have been recent advances in modeling tools and a greater proliferation of publications. In addition, the importance of customizing tDCS for potentially vulnerable populations (eg, skull defects, brain damage/stroke, and extremes of age) can be considered. Finally, computational models can be used to design new electrode montages, for example, to improve spatial targeting such as high-definition tDCS. Pending further validation and dissemination of modeling tools, computational forward models of neuromodulation will become standard tools to guide the optimization of clinical trials and electrotherapy.",Excluded,0.103440985
385,"A novel small molecule inhibitor of MRCK prevents radiation driven invasion in glioblastoma. Purpose or Objective Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and incurable primary brain tumour that causes severe neurological, cognitive and psychological symptoms. Symptoms are caused and/or exacerbated by the infiltrative properties of GBM cells, which enable them to pervade the healthy brain, disrupting normal function. Recent research has indicated that, while radiotherapy extends life expectancy of patients, it can provoke a more infiltrative phenotype in those GBM cells that survive treatment. In this study we investigate the role of the actin-myosin regulatory kinase, MRCK, in radiation driven infiltration by GBM cells and probe its potential as an anti-invasive target using a novel MRCK specific inhibitor. Material and Methods In vitro motility assays with single cell tracking were used to measure the migration speed of GBM cells on a petri dish. The results were confirmed using an ex vivo assay that uses confocal time-lapse microscopy and single cell tracking to measure the speed of GBM cells migrating through fresh murine brain slices Biomarker response was measure via immuno-blotting, immuno-fluorescence and immuno-histochemistry. In vivo experiments utilised a intracranial xenograft model using a primary GBM cell line. Mice were irradiated using a Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP, Xstrahl). Results GBM cells classically adopt a mesenchymal mode of cell invasion, characterised by an elongated cell body and actin-rich protrusions. Mesenchymal migration requires the activation of the actin-myosin regulatory kinase, MRCK, and consequent phosphorylation of the downstream effectors MLC2 and MYPT1. By measuring relative phosphorylation levels of the MRCK biomarkers, pMLC2 and pMYPT1, we demonstrate that MRCK activity is enhanced at the invasive edges of GBM tumours and is further enhanced by irradiation both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that this response is essential to the phenomenon of radiation induced migration of GBM cells in vitro through MRCK targeted RNAi. Crucially, we were also able to fully abrogate radiation driven invasion in vivo by using a novel small molecule inhibitor, BDP-9066, to specifically target MRCK in a clinically relevant intracranial mouse model of GBM. These data confirm the pivotal role of MRCK in radiation driven infiltration. We are currently undertaking an experiment to investigate whether the anti-invasive effects of BDP-9066 translate into increased survival in our intracranial GBM model, and therefore further validate MRCK as a potential antiinvasive therapeutic target in GBM. Conclusion In conclusion, we have identified a novel and highly promising anti-invasive therapeutic target in GBM, MRCK, which in combination with existing standard of care for glioblastoma, has the potential to improve outcomes for this cancer of unmet need.",Excluded,0.9162635
386,"Temozolomide for central nervous system involvement in mycosis fungoides. BACKGROUND: The central nervous system (CNS) is one of the most commonly involved sites in the systemic progression of primary cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCLs) such as mycosis fungoides (MF). There is no consensus on the treatment of CNS progression in CTCL, but survival of 3-6 months is suggested when methotrexate-based chemotherapy and/or CNS irradiation is used. Temozolomide is active in earlier stages of MF and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. There are no published data on its use in MF patients with CNS involvement.METHODS: Four MF patients were treated with oral temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) per day for 5 d on a 28-day cycle) for CNS progression. Two patients received temozolomide with low-dose CNS irradiation as initial treatment, and two received temozolomide following disease progression after methotrexate-based chemotherapy and CNS irradiation. All patients received dexamethasone.RESULTS: Temozolomide was well tolerated; there were no treatment withdrawals or dose reductions caused by toxicity. Patient 1 had an excellent partial response in pre-irradiated disease. Patient 2 showed disease stabilization following irradiation. Patient 3 showed a complete response after a partial response to irradiation. Patient 4 demonstrated continued stabilization after a partial response to irradiation. Overall survival ranged from 10 to 33 months. Patient 3 remains alive and symptom-free at 23 months following treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Temozolomide following low-dose CNS irradiation appears to be well tolerated and effective in MF patients with CNS progression. It may represent a less toxic alternative to chemotherapy containing methotrexate or an option for second-line therapy.",Excluded,0.104389444

Purpose: Portal vein embolization is an accepted technique for hypertrophy of the left lobe in patients with small future liver remnant ratio (FLR). Vouche et al. showed a comparable effect following right lobe radiation lobectomy with glass microspheres. Unlike PVE, radiation lobectomy has the potential advantage of simultaneous tumor control. Right lobe selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with resin microspheres (SIR-Spheres, Sydney, Australia) is hypothesized to induce similar volumetric changes in the liver at 3 and 6 months (m), while also providing directed therapy to the right liver. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen patients (mean age 62 y, 8M, 7F) with unilobar disease were treated with right lobar SIRT utilizing resin microspheres (mean dose 34.1 mCi, range 11-80) between September 2009 and December 2013. Neoplasm types included hepatocellular (n=5), cholangiocarcinoma (n=4), metastatic colon (n=2), gallbladder (n=1), appendiceal (n=1), thyroid (n=1) and neuroendocrine (n=1). Total liver volumes, lobar volumes, FLR, and % of FLR hypertrophy from baseline (%FLR) were assessed prior to and after right lobar SIRT at 3m and 6m follow-up utilizing CT or MRI. Result(s): Follow-up imaging was available for 13/15 patients at 3m and 11/15 patients at 6m. Left lobe hypertrophy was seen at 3m (p=0.002) and 6m (p=0.003). Right lobe atrophy was also seen at 3m (p=0.02) and 6m (p=0.04). FLR hypertrophy was seen at both time points: 29.1% (range, 2.5-46.5, p=0.003) at 3m and 30.7% (range, 2.8-62.8, p=0.003) at 6m.

Questions of ceiling effects and discriminability when evaluating individuals assumed to be of above average intelligence should be considered. The current study examines ceiling effects and discriminability on IQ assessment between pilots vs. mission specialists and men vs. women in the selection of astronaut candidates.METHODS: IQ scores on 104 male and female Shuttle astronaut candidates as measured by the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery (MAB) were analyzed via factor analyses and tests of differences between genders, selection status, and job types. Total group, gender, and job type specificity and sensitivity and overall percent correctly classified were assessed on selected vs. unselected classification.RESULTS: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses failed to replicate the proposed factor configuration prompting reconfigured domain scores. Analyses of differences between gender, selection, and job categories found different results when using reconfigured IQ scores compared to the original formulation. The 10 subscales performed better than overall domain scores in sensitivity, specificity, and as significant predictors of individuals selected. Both versions of Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQ scores performed similarly regarding sensitivity and specificity. The reconfigured scores were better predictors of selection.DISCUSSION: Evidence for sensitivity, specificity, and classification prediction was better for subscales than overall domain scores.

Background: We intended to assess the clinicopathological features and treatment outcome in patients of intracranial atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumour (AT/RT), a rare malignant tumour of the brain. Material(s) and Method(s): Medical records were reviewed and clinical data collected on AT/RT in a 6 year period (2006-12). Histopathology slides were reviewed and relevant immunohistochemistry stains were done. Overall survival was analysed by Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis of factors predictive of overall survival was done by Log Rank test. Result(s): 15 patients met the study criterion (male: female=4:1). Median age at presentation was 5 years (range 0.8-8 years). Presenting complaints included vomiting (73.33%), headache (46.67%), orbital symptoms (33.33%), motor impairment (26.67%), gait abnormality (20%) and seizure (20%). Median duration of symptoms was noted to be 2 months (range 0.5-6 months). On contrast enhanced MRI of brain, tumour location was supratentorial in 60% patients and infratentorial in 40% patients. Cystic component and hydrocephalus were noted in 73.33% patients each whereas contrast enhancement and calcification were discerned in 53.33% and 40% of the patients respectively. All patients underwent tumour resection - gross total (26.67%), neartotal (13.33%) and subtotal (60%). Histopathology was confirmative of AT/RT with MIB-1 labelling index varying from 11-85% (median 45%). There was lack of immunostaining for INI-1 suggesting INI-1 mutation. Majority of tumours exhibited immunopositivity for EMA (93.33%), synaptophysin (80%), cytokeratin (66.67%), vimentin (66.7%), SMA (60%), GFAP (46.67%). Adjuvant radiation (36 Gy/20#/4 weeks to entire neuraxis followed by local boost 20 Gy/10#/2 weeks) was started in 6 patients (40%) and completed in 5 patients. Young age at presentation and poor performance status precluded the use of radiation in the remainder. Systemic chemotherapy was administered in 10 (66.67%) patients. Median number of cycles given was 3 (range 1-12) with ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) and VAC (vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide) being the common regimens (26.67% and 20% respectively). After a median follow-up of 8.33 months (mean-12.27 months), median overall survival was noted to be 10 months. At last follow-up, 2 patients are in complete response, 1 patient is on treatment, 3 patients are alive with evidence of disease and 9 patients expired due to disease progression. The 1 and 2 year actuarial rate of overall survival was noted to be 48.1% and 24.1% respectively. On univariate analysis, extent of surgery (p = 0.0149), use of craniospinal radiation (p = 0.0087) and MIB-1 labelling index (p = 0.0034) were significant predictors of overall survival while age (>=5 years versus <5 years) was of borderline significance (p = 0.08).

Material(s) and Method(s): We intended to assess the clinical features and treatment outcome in patients of pineal parenchymal tumor attending our hospital from 2003-13. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): 23 patients met the study criterion (median age=22 years and male: female=14:9). Presenting complaints included headache (73.91%), visual symptoms (43.48%), vomiting (30.43%) and ataxia (26.09%). Preoperative contrast enhanced MRI and CT scan of brain were performed in 78.26% and 17.3% of patients respectively. Spinal drop metastasis and CSF cytology positivity were noted in 3 and 2 patients respectively. Surgery included gross total resection in 21.74%, near total resection in 13.04%, subtotal resection in 17.39% and tumor biopsy in 43.48% of the patients. 12 (52.17%) patients required the placement of VP shunt. Histopathology was confirmative of PB in 14 (60.87%) patients, PPTID in 6 (26.09%) patients and PC in 3 (13.04%) patients. MIB-1 labeling index varied from 2-80% with median value of 30% and 4.5% in PB and PPTID respectively. 22 (95.65%) patients underwent radiation therapy- craniospinal irradiation (CSI) in 14(60.87%) patients, whole brain radiation in 1 patient, whole ventricular radiation in 1 patient and local radiation in 6 (26.09%) patients. Majority (85.7%) of patients of PB underwent CSI- 36 Gy/ 20 fractions/ 4 weeks to whole brain followed by boost of 20 Gy/10 fractions/ 2 weeks to pineal region and 30-36 Gy/ 20 fractions/ 4 weeks to spinal axis as per risk stratification. Systemic chemotherapy was administered in 12 (52.17%) patients (11-PB and 1-PC) with EP (etoposide and carboplatin) being the most common regimen (30.43%). The median number of cycles administered was 6 (range 3-6). After a median follow-up of 26.87 months, death and recurrence were observed in 2 and 10 patients (local recurrence- 34.78% and spinal drop metastases- 26.09%) respectively. Median RFS was noted to be 2.33 years, 14.29 years and 6.76 years in patients of PB, PPTID and PC respectively. The 2 and 3 year actuarial RFS rates in the entire cohort were respectively 71.6% and 57.9%. Salvage treatment was offered in 6 patients. Median overall survival was not reached. On univariate analysis (Log rank test), age (<18 versus >18 years), sex, histology, extent of surgery (biopsy versus resection) and use of chemotherapy had no significant impact on RFS. Conclusion(s): Maximal safe resection followed by radiation therapy is the mainstay of treatment in pineal parenchymal tumor. Radiation volume encompasses the craniospinal axis in pinealoblastoma and the tumor bed with margin in pineocytoma.

The measurements were made in a geometry used for irradiation of intracranial lesions. For radii less than 1.0 cm the dose on the central axis is progressively reduced due to electron disequilibrium. This leads to measurement artifacts when the detector is too large, as was readily observed with ionization chambers. Radiographic and radiochromic films were used with densitometric evaluation to provide the resolution necessary to measure absorbed doses for the narrowest beams.

To explore new potential biological risk factors for glioblastoma, we investigated alterations in metabolite concentrations in pre-diagnosed serum samples from glioblastoma patients diagnosed up to 22 years after sample collection, and undiseased controls. The study points out a latent biomarker for future glioblastoma consisting of nine metabolites (gamma-tocopherol, alpha-tocopherol, erythritol, erythronic acid, myo-inositol, cystine, 2-keto-L-gluconic acid, hypoxanthine and xanthine) involved in antioxidant metabolism. We detected significantly higher serum concentrations of alpha-tocopherol (p=0.0018) and gamma-tocopherol (p=0.0009) in future glioblastoma cases. Compared to their matched controls, the cases showed a significant average fold increase of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol levels: 1.2 for alpha-T (p=0.018) and 1.6 for gamma-T (p=0.003).

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated cerebral blood flow regulation in astronauts before and after flights. We hypothesized that autoregulation would be different before flight and after flight between nonfinishers and the finishers of a stand test.METHODS: Twenty-seven astronauts from shuttle missions lasting 8 to 16 days underwent a 10-minute stand test: 10 days before flight, 1 to 2 hours and 3 days after landing. Mean blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was measured using transcranial Doppler; Mean arterial pressure was measured using a Finapres (Ohmeda, Englewood, CO) and was adjusted to the level of the MCA (BP(MCA)). Cross-spectral power, gain, phase, and coherence were determined for the relation between BP(MCA) and the cerebrovascular resistance index mean blood flow velocity/BP(MCA).RESULTS: BP(MCA) was reduced with stand (P<0.001). Differences between finishers and nonfinishers (P=0.011) and over test days (P=0.004) were observed. Cerebrovascular conductance was affected by stand (P<0.001), by group (P<0.001) with a group by stand, and test day interaction (P<0.01). Preflight data suggest that the nonfinishers were operating at a higher cerebral vasodilation than finishers for a given BP(MCA), and on landing day the nonfinishers had a greater decrease in mean blood flow velocity as a function of BP(MCA) with standing compared to finishers and preflight. There was a significant interaction effect of gender over the test days and from supine to stand (P=0.035).CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the cause of presyncope in astronauts may be related to a mismatch of cerebral blood flow with blood pressure.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to implement a technique to prospectively correct for the effect of susceptibility induced magnetic field gradients on R2' weighted data. This was achieved by combining the Gradient-Echo Slice Excitation Profile Imaging (GESEPI) technique with an Asymmetric Spin Echo (ASE) pulse sequence. The main advantages of this approach are (i) shorter acquisition times, since a separately acquired magnetic field map is not required and (ii) simpler analysis, since retrospective correction for the effects of magnetic field gradients in postprocessing is not required. In these experiments we show that with this newly developed technique it is possible to correct the majority of grey matter voxels for the expected distribution of through-slice magnetic field gradients to produce maps of R2' in a short scan duration.",Excluded,0.103317104
410,"Strategy for planned radiotherapy of malignant gliomas: postoperative treatment with combinations of high dose proton irradiation and tumor seeking radionuclides. A strategy for improved treatment of malignant gliomas grade III-IV is presented. The strategy can briefly be described as surgical removal of the bulky tumor, high precision external irradiation of small brain volumes over and near the primary tumor area with high doses from proton beams, and thereafter treatment of spread cells with toxic radionuclides. Proton beams suitable for this are under development. The clinical effects of high single doses on malignant gliomas grade III-IV are presently tested with conventional gamma radiation. Targeting of spread glioma cells with toxic radionuclides tagged to epidermal growth factor, EGF, or to EGF-dextran is presently tested in experimental systems and can, in the near future, be tested in combination with local high doses of external proton radiation. The possibilities to combine proton beams with EGF-guided neutron capture therapy will be considered in a longer perspective.",Excluded,0.13891074

412,"Light-induced modulation of coupling between AII amacrine cells in the rabbit retina. The rod-driven, AII amacrine cells in the mammalian retina maintain homologous gap junctions with one another as well as heterologous gap junctions with on-cone bipolar cells. We used background illumination to study whether changes in the adaptational state of the retina affected the permeabilities of these two sets of gap junctions. To access changes in permeability, we injected single AII amacrine cells with the biotinylated tracer, Neurobiotin, and measured the extent of tracer coupling to neighboring AII cells and neighboring cone bipolar cells. We also measured the center-receptive field size of AII cells to assess concomitant changes in electrical coupling. Our results indicate that in well dark-adapted retinas, AII cells form relatively small networks averaging 20 amacrine cells and covering about 75 microns. The size of these networks matched closely to the size of AII cell on-center receptive fields. However, over most of their operating range, AII cells formed dramatically larger networks, averaging 326 amacrine cells, which corresponded to an increased receptive-field size. As the retina was light adapted beyond the operating range of the AII cells, they uncoupled to form networks comparable in size to those seem in well dark-adapted retinas. Our results, then, indicate that the adaptational state of the retina has a profound effect on the extent of electrical coupling between AII amacrine cells. Although we observed light-induced changes in the number of tracer-coupled cone bipolar cells, these appeared to be an epiphenomenon of changes in homologous coupling between AII amacrine cells. Therefore, in contrast to the robust changes in AII-AII coupling produced by background illumination, our data provided no evidence of a light-induced modulation of coupling between AII cells and on-cone bipolar cells.",Excluded,0.102645926

414,"Accelerator-based epithermal neutron sources for boron neutron capture therapy of brain tumors. This paper reviews the development of low-energy light ion accelerator-based neutron sources (ABNSs) for the treatment of brain tumors through an intact scalp and skull using boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). A major advantage of an ABNS for BNCT over reactor-based neutron sources is the potential for siting within a hospital. Consequently, light-ion accelerators that are injectors to larger machines in high-energy physics facilities are not considered. An ABNS for BNCT is composed of: (1) the accelerator hardware for producing a high current charged particle beam, (2) an appropriate neutron-producing target and target heat removal system (HRS), and (3) a moderator/reflector assembly to render the flux energy spectrum of neutrons produced in the target suitable for patient irradiation. As a consequence of the efforts of researchers throughout the world, progress has been made on the design, manufacture, and testing of these three major components. Although an ABNS facility has not yet been built that has optimally assembled these three components, the feasibility of clinically useful ABNSs has been clearly established. Both electrostatic and radio frequency linear accelerators of reasonable cost (approximately 1.5 M dollars) appear to be capable of producing charged particle beams, with combinations of accelerated particle energy (a few MeV) and beam currents (approximately 10 mA) that are suitable for a hospital-based ABNS for BNCT. The specific accelerator performance requirements depend upon the charged particle reaction by which neutrons are produced in the target and the clinical requirements for neutron field quality and intensity. The accelerator performance requirements are more demanding for beryllium than for lithium as a target. However, beryllium targets are more easily cooled. The accelerator performance requirements are also more demanding for greater neutron field quality and intensity. Target HRSs that are based on submerged-jet impingement and the use of microchannels have emerged as viable target cooling options. Neutron fields for reactor-based neutron sources provide an obvious basis of comparison for ABNS field quality. This paper compares Monte Carlo calculations of neutron field quality for an ABNS and an idealized standard reactor neutron field (ISRNF). The comparison shows that with lithium as a target, an ABNS can create a neutron field with a field quality that is significantly better (by a factor of approximately 1.2, as judged by the relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-dose that can be delivered to a tumor at a depth of 6cm) than that for the ISRNF. Also, for a beam current of 10 mA, the treatment time is calculated to be reasonable (approximately 30 min) for the boron concentrations that have been assumed. [References: 46]",Excluded,0.10243445
415,"Cisplatin and vinblastine chemotherapy for metastatic non-small cell carcinoma followed by irradiation in patients with regional disease. Forty-four patients with non-small cell carcinoma of the lung were treated every 3 weeks with vinblastine (4 mg/m2/day iv X 2) and cisplatin (20 mg/m2/day iv X 3). Of the 28 patients with metastatic disease, eight (29%; 90% confidence interval of true response, 17%-47%) achieved objective response, for a median duration of 27 weeks. Median survival in this group was 47 and 28 weeks for responders and nonresponders, respectively. Of the 16 patients with advanced regional disease, 11 (69%; 90% confidence interval of true response, 49%-86%) achieved objective response. Thirteen of these patients received consolidation radiotherapy (4500 cGy/25 fractions/5 weeks), with a boost of 1000 cGy/5 fractions/1 week in those patients who achieved response. In the three patients who did not receive radiotherapy, two died during the induction phase, one from grade 4 leukopenia and sepsis and the second from unrelated factors. The third patient had systemic progression of disease during induction chemotherapy. Six patients experienced overall improvement in their chemotherapy response from the radiotherapy. Two patients who did not respond to the chemotherapy achieved partial response with irradiation. Four patients who had partial response to the chemotherapy achieved complete response with irradiation, and seven patients had no further change in their degree of response to irradiation. The overall median survival of this group was 81 weeks. Maintenance chemotherapy was not given. After radiotherapy, the site of first failure was outside the radiation field in nine of 13 patients (69%). Hematologic toxicity was dose-limiting. Other toxic effects that were not dose-limiting included nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and acute nausea and vomiting. In the patients with advanced regional disease, there was no increase in the radiation toxicity attributable to the chemotherapy. We conclude that: (a) this dose schedule of vinblastine and cisplatin has reproducible activity in non-small cell carcinoma of the lung; (b) the response and median survival of patients with advanced regional disease are superior to those of patients with metastatic disease; and (c) in patients with advanced regional disease, treatment with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy yielded an overall response rate of 81% (90% confidence interval of true response, 60%-93%) and improved survival compared to a similar group of patients studied by others receiving radiotherapy alone.

In nonirradiated controls amyloidosis increased in prevalence with age after 12 months, and prevalence was higher in females than in males. Irradiation had the effect of advancing the appearance of amyloidosis to the 7-12 months group but did not intensify the amyloidotic process. IgG binding to the nucleus or cytoplasm of neurons was rare, and, despite the fact that IgM and IgA binding to these structures was present in about one-third of the animals, there was neither an aging nor an irradiation effect.

The secondary task had comparable effects on tracking performance in space and on Earth.CONCLUSIONS: Response slowing in space is not due to an increased dependence on visual feedback, since it persists without hand vision. Differential effects of microgravity on pointing and tracking could be due to subjects' strategic decisions.",Excluded,0.1670036

Prosthetic rehabilitation, particularly in radiated areas, can be particularly difficult in patients with partial or total edentation following treatment for orofacial cancer. We report a series of patients who underwent a protocol of implantation in radiated bone with evaluation of the prosthetic rehabilitation. Material and method. Thirty-three patients given radiotherapy for an orofacial cancer were implanted, followed by a dental prosthesis. The three phases of the protocol were a preoperative clinical and radiological analysis, a surgical phase under general anaesthesia and a postoperative clinical and radiological follow-up. Results. Fifteen patients were treated for an oral cavity tumor, ten for a pharyngeal lesion, six for a laryngeal tumor and two for a maxillary cancer. The average dose of radiotherapy was 60.5 Gy. Sixty-eight implants were positioned, 91.9% in the anterior mandible. The delay between radiotherapy and implantation was 54 months. The delay between implantation and loading was seven months. The average follow-up was 31.9 months. No peri-implantitis was observed. Discussion. Implantation in irradiated bone is possible if a strict protocol is used; a good rate of success and improved quality of life will favour development of this technique. Criteria for dental implant placement include local and general conditions, the psychological situation and technical possibilities. Sufficient delay after radiotherapy is necessary to verify healing and the good prognosis of the cancer. The vascular supply can be preserved by implantation under general anesthesia. All patients were satisfied with the functional and esthetic results. © Masson, 2006.",Excluded,0.10421799

BACKGROUND: Identification of peri-operative variables predicting postoperative morbidity may improve postoperative patients' care. We aimed to identify patients' characteristics and operative factors predictive of early (<= 30-day) and late (<= 6-month) morbidity in cervical cancer patients undergoing surgery plus external beam radiotherapy (EBRT).METHODS: We studied 45 propensity-matched patient pairs (90 patients) undergoing laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (LRH) plus EBRT vs. abdominal radical hysterectomy (RAH) plus EBRT. Basic descriptive, multivariable and artificial neuronal network analyses (ANN) were used to design predicting models influencing outcomes.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the study populations were similar. Patients undergoing LRH experienced lower blood loss (200 (range, 10-700) vs. 400 (range, 100-2000) ml; P < 0.001), shorter length of hospital stay (4 (range, 1-10) vs. 8 (range, 5-52) days; P < 0.001) and similar operative time (235 (+/- 67.3) vs. 258 (+/- 70.2) min; P = 0.14) than patients undergoing RAH.

424,"A common sense approach to radiotherapy planning of glioblastoma multiforme situated in the temporal lobe. PURPOSE: Irradiation remains the cornerstone of management for glioblastoma multiforme. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer advocate encompassing the primary tumor plus a 2-cm margin in the high-dose volume. One shortcoming of this approach is the exposure of critical structures to radiation doses that could exceed organ tolerance. We investigated whether the temporal bone (rather than the aforementioned 2-cm radius) would serve as a barrier to tumor spread when regarded as the anterior margin for temporal lobe lesions. We hypothesized that by using the temporal bone as the radiation field margin, toxicity could be reduced without compromising tumor control.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 2003 and 2007, 342 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme were treated with surgery and primary irradiation at our institution. Of these 342 patients, 50 had lesions confined to the temporal lobe. The clinical target volume included the primary lesion, the area of edema when present, and a 2-cm margin, except in the direction of the temporal bone.RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 40 were available for evaluation. At a median follow-up of 12.95 months, 8 patients had not yet shown signs of tumor progression, 24 had local failure, 7 had distant or mixed (local plus distant) failure, and only 1 patient had failure in the infratemporal fossa.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study have demonstrated an acceptable level of recurrence when the temporal bone, rather than a 2-cm margin, is used as the anterior border of the clinical target volume.

The most frequent findings across all follow-up examinations were macular microaneurysms (75.6% of examinations), macular angiographic leakage (75.1%), and optic disc hyperfluorescence (62.8%). The median number of features present increased significantly with each follow-up to a maximum of 7 features at 8 years. The prevalence of neovascularization of the disc at 5 years was 5.2%. The prevalence of optic neuropathy at 5 years was 27.4%. Prognostic factors for more prevalent and severe posterior pole abnormalities were diabetes, tumor location close to both optic nerve and foveal avascular zone, and greater dose of radiation to the foveola and optic nerve head.CONCLUSIONS: The amount and severity of retinopathy and optic neuropathy after iodine-125 brachytherapy increased through 8 years of follow-up.

We present a case report of a 74-year-oldwoman originally referred to neurology with a 5 month history of pain on the right side of her chin, associated with a sensation of sunburn and a 'feeling of a clumsy tongue'. She had no history of radiation exposure and did not smoke.

427,"Other dementias. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of degenerative dementia in elderly people after Alzheimer's disease (AD), with approximately 10-15% of dementia cases at autopsy demonstrating the presence of Lewy body pathology [1]. In Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia is a common outcome in up to 80% of patients with PD who will eventually develop dementia as their disease progresses [2, 3]. DLB and PD can be grouped under the umbrella term of Lewy body disease (LBD) due to the overlap in symptom profile, similar response to treatment and the common underlying alpha-synuclein aggregation neuropathology [4]. Together DLB and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) represent an important disease group in older age, with significant health and social impacts. LBD patients display marked deficits in executive and visuo-spatial/visuo-perceptual function, as well as marked variations in their level of arousal and attention which are known as cognitive fluctuations [5-8]. LBD clinical features also include spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism [6], and nonmotor manifestations including symptoms such as visual hallucinations, autonomic dysfunction, syncope, repeated falls, REM sleep behaviour disorder, delusions and depression [6]. However, there are a number of important diagnostic challenges. For example, the differentiation of DLB from Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be difficult, particularly in the early stages of disease when core DLB symptoms may be less evident [9]. Similarly, discrimination between PD, PD or DLB with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, MCI-DLB) and PDD can be problematic as the development of cognitive impairment is often insidious and appears at a variable time after PD diagnosis [10]. There are also a number of treatment challenges. Profound cholinergic deficits occur in the LBDs, even more than in AD [11]. The use of cholinesterase inhibitors may have cognitive and neuropsychiatric benefits including improvements in global cognitive function, attentional function and activities of daily living [12]. However, there are frequently variations in treatment response [13]. The development of novel therapeutics is required, but this process has been hampered by the lack of LBD biomarkers which are sensitive to treatment response. In summary, therefore, there is a clear need to develop LBD biomarkers in order to facilitate early and differential diagnosis (during the prodromal phase of disease); improve our understanding of disease progression; provide a means to monitor therapeutic response; pave the way for early disease-modifying interventions. Existing biomarkers include a range of clinical, biochemical, genetic, proteomic, and, in particular, neuroimaging biomarkers [17, 18]. Generally the utility of these biomarkers has only been supported in a research context aside from dopamine transporter imaging, which due to its high specificity in differentiating LBD from AD [19] is now considered the gold standard for in vivo differential diagnosis between LBD and AD. However FP-CIT remains expensive, has a radioactive exposure and provides little or no information on the disease progression, prognosis, or correlation with cognitive/behavioural symptom severity. Biomarkers should ideally be inexpensive, non-invasive, simple to use and technically validated [20]. In this regard, neurophysiological measures, and in particular electroencephalography (EEG), are currently undergoing a renaissance as potential biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease.",Excluded,0.10352039

Acrylamide was administered orally to 6 week old male rats in ten doses, spread over a two week period. At the two lower doses (5 and 10 mg/kg, total dose 50 and 100 mg/kg) effects on neurotransmitter receptor sites appeared confirmed to the striatum where both the dopamine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors exhibited enhanced binding twenty four hours after the last acrylamide dose. Other receptor sites within the frontal cortex, cerebellum, and medulla were not significantly altered. At the highest dose (20 mg/kg, given ten times), increases were also found for frontal cortical serotonin, medullary glycine, and cerebellar GABA receptor sites. The only unaffected receptor found was the cortical site for benzodiazepene. One week after the final acrylamide dose, the intensity of all ligands studied was not significantly different in treated and control groups. Thus, effects appeared reversible. Since striatal membrane protein concentration was reduced by treatment with rats with acrylamide, the observed increase in activity of muscarinic receptors could be best accounted for in terms of loss of striatal non-receptor protein rather than increased binding. However, the magnitude of increased striatal <sup>3</sup>H-spiroperidol binding in treated animals suggested an increase in overall binding capacity.

430,"CT follow-up in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs): combined radiation and contrast dose reduction. Background Frequent computed tomography (CT) follow-ups involve significant radiation related risks for patients with low-grade neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Contrast agent (CA) application is essential for diagnostic evidence and has additional risks especially in patients with limited renal function. Purpose To investigate if a combination of dose and contrast agent (CA) reduction affects image quality and diagnostic evidence in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients. Material and Methods A total of 51 NET patients were enrolled in the study and 153 CT scans were analyzed. Patients underwent a baseline CT scan (A = 120 kVp, filtered back projection [FBP]) and two follow-up CTs (B = 120 kVp, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction [ASIR] 40%; C1 = 100 kVp, ASIR 40%; C2 = 100 kVp, ASIR 60%; the latter two protocols were applied with a 30% reduction in CA volume). We evaluated image quality and applied dose. Results In C1/2, the combination of low kV (100 kVp) with ASIR 40%/60% reduced the mean applied dose significantly by 28% compared to B and by 57% compared to A. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of tumor to liver/muscle were significantly increased by using C1/2 compared to B and A. With respect to subjective image quality, a slight loss of diagnostic confidence in C1 could be counterbalanced by the higher ASIR blending in C2. Conclusion Combined dose reduction techniques can be used to reduce radiation dose and CA volume without sacrificing image quality and diagnostic confidence in staging CT of NET patients.",Excluded,0.10410694

Purpose/Objective: to report the clinical outcome and toxicity of patients affected by nasopharyngeal cancer treated with different radiotherapy (RT) techniques, namely 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Material(s) and Method(s): between January 2000 and December 2013, 82 patients underwent concomitant chemo-radiation with curative intent. By January 2007, IMRT was clinically available at our department and became preferentially adopted in place of 3DCRT. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from first day of treatment to progressive disease or death from any cause; overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from first day of treatment to death from any cause. Acute and late toxicities were retrospectively evaluated according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0) and LENT SOMA scale, respectively. Result(s): Fifty-one patients (62.2%) were treated with 3DCRT while 31 with IMRT (37.8%). The median age of patients was 52.4 years. The majority of patients (54; 65.8%) were diagnosed with loco-regional advanced disease: 35 (42.6%) were in stage IVA/IVB disease and 19 (23.1%) in stage III, respectively. Sixty-four patients (78%) were treated with a conventionally-fractionated, 7 weeks RT regimen delivered in a sequential approach: 50 Gy were delivered to sites deemed at low risk of microscopic infiltration, 60 Gy to macroscopic uninvolved sites but deemed at high risk of disease presence or relapse, 70 Gy to tumor and involved nodal clinical target volumes (CTV's). In 18 patients (22%) the IMRT technique allowed the simultaneous delivery of different doses per fraction, namely 1.8 Gy, 2 Gy and 2.2 Gy aimed at the same volumes described above within a shorter overall treatment time (30 fractions delivered in 6 weeks). The majority of patients (62; 75.6%) received cisplatin-based, concomitant chemotherapy: a 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> three-weekly schedule was administered to 34 of them (56%) while the rest (28; 44%) received a 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly schedule. Twenty patients (24.3%) of the whole cohort diagnosed with very advanced tumors infiltrating neurological structures were given induction chemotherapy (cisplatin-5 fluorouracil or cisplatin- 5 fluoruracil-docetaxel regimens) before concomitant chemoradiation. Twenty patients (24.3%), mostly affected by stage I and II N0 disease, or unfit to receive chemotherapy, were treated with radiotherapy alone. In terms of clinical outcome, the 30-month PFS was 69.6%; progressive disease was diagnosed in 25 patients (30.4%), among them 18 treated with 3DCRT and 7 with IMRT. The first site of failure was distant in 12 (48%) cases and loco-regional in 13 (52%). In terms of OS, at a median follow-up of 51 months, 47 patients (57.3%) were alive. Regarding acute toxicity, the most frequent adverse event was severe (G3-G4) mucositis which was diagnosed in 17 patients in the 3DCRT group (33.3%) and in 8 in the IMRT group (25.8%). The 12-month xerostomia of moderate-severe intensity (G2-G3) was also more frequently found in the 3DCRT cohort than in the IMRT one (31.3% and 10% of patients, respectively).

Purpose: To investigate MRI myelin water imaging (MWI) by multicomponent T<inf>2</inf> relaxometry as a quantitative imaging biomarker for brain radiation-induced changes and to compare it with DTI. Method(s): Sixteen patients underwent fractionated proton therapy (PT) receiving dose to the healthy tissue because of direct or indirect (base skull tumors) irradiation. MWI was performed by a multi-echo sequence with 32 equally spaced echoes (10-320 ms). Decay data were processed to identify 3 T<inf>2</inf> compartments: myelin water (Mw) below 40 ms, intra-extracellular water (IEw) between 40 and 250 ms, and free water (CSFw) above 250 ms. Both MWI and DTI scans were acquired pre (pre)-treatment and immediately at the end (end) of PT. After image registration, voxel-wise difference maps, obtained by subtracting MWI and DTI pre from those acquired at the end of PT, were compared with the corresponding biological equivalent dose (BED). Result(s): Mw difference showed a positive correlation and IEw difference showed a negative correlation with BED considering end-pre changes (P <.01). The changes in CSFw were not significantly correlated with the delivered BED. The changes in DTI data, considering end-pre acquisitions, showed a positive correlation between fractional anisotropy and the delivered BED. Conclusion(s): MWI might detect early white matter radiation-induced alterations, providing additional information to DTI, which might improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of the radiation damage.

433,"Clinical and sociodemographic factors that affect the quality of life of survivors of head and neck cancer. OBJECTIVE: The present cross-sectional study evaluated the quality of life of patients treated with 3-D conformal radiotherapy for cancer of the mouth, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx and investigated possible associations with clinical and sociodemographic variables using multivariate analysis.METHODS: The sample was composed of 90 patients who had completed treatment at least 3 months earlier. Data were collected from April 2016 to May 2017. The patients were clinically evaluated with regard to stimulated salivary flow, trismus, and radiation caries. Sociodemographic data and data related to the disease (stage, location of primary tumor, and radiation dose) were collected from the patient charts. Quality of life was assessed using the Brazilian version of the University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QOL) questionnaire. Poisson logistic regression was performed to determine the mean ratio and test associations with the clinical and sociodemographic variables.RESULTS: The mean total of the UW-QOL was 814.88 (+/- 224.58). Patient age, staging of cancer, hyposalivation, and trismus were associated with quality of life. Patients with tumors in the advanced stage, those with hyposalivation and those with trismus respectively had 11% (CI 0.80-0.98), 12% (CI 0.79-0.99), and 15% (CI 0.77-0.94) lower UW-QOL scores, indicating poorer quality of life.CONCLUSION: Survivors of head and neck cancer experience a negative impact on quality of life associated with trismus, hyposalivation, advanced stage tumors, and a younger patient age. The present findings underscore the importance of a specific approach focused on these aspects to ensure better quality of life in the long term.",Excluded,0.6622891

436,"Modelling the radiotherapy effect in the reaction-diffusion equation. PURPOSE: In recent years, the reaction-diffusion (Fisher-Kolmogorov) equation has received much attention from the oncology research community due to its ability to describe the infiltrating nature of glioblastoma multiforme and its extraordinary resistance to any type of therapy. However, in a number of previous papers in the literature on applications of this equation, the term (R) expressing the 'External Radiotherapy effect' was incorrectly derived. In this note we derive an analytical expression for this term in the correct form to be included in the reaction-diffusion equation.METHODS: The R term has been derived starting from the Linear-Quadratic theory of cell killing by ionizing radiation. The correct definition of R was adopted and the basic principles of differential calculus applied.RESULTS: The compatibility of the R term derived here with the reaction-diffusion equation was demonstrated. Referring to a typical glioblastoma tumour, we have compared the results obtained using our expression for the R term with the 'incorrect' expression proposed by other authors.",Excluded,0.102451794
437,"Hifu generated fast hyperthermia as a new option for glioblastoma treatment. Introduction: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive tumor of the central nervous system, corresponding to grade IV of the World Health Organization histological classification (Louis et al., 2007). High grade gliomas are the most common primary brain tumor in adults, with an incidence of 3.1 per 100,000 person-year in the USA and the median survival times of 14.6 months (Stupp et al., 2005) after first occurrence and 11.9 after the first re-resection (Quick et al., 2014). Against to this pathology, we proposed (Borasi et al., 2014) the use of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Material(s) and Method(s): The first brain tumor ablation treatments with the magnetic resonance (MR) guided HIFU (Exablate Neuro), recently described (Coluccia et al., 2014), revealed the power limitation of the system in penetrating the skull bone so that only a small tumor volume could be ablated. We then concentrate ourselves on the use of this HIFU device for administering, on a larger possible volume, a low power ""fast hyperthermia"", coupled with a standard EBRT protocol. We simulated the combined effect of radiotherapy (EBRT) and fast hyperthermia (FH) in the mathematical frame of Fisher-Kolmogorov equation. A new formulation of the synergistic effect has been developed. Result(s): The EBRT plus FH should be able to overcome the main problem of GBM treatments, that is, the progressive modification to a more aggressive and resistant entity, due to a subset of glioma cells that share many characteristics with stem cells (Galli et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2004). These cells are generally resistant to RX and TMZ and are considered a cause of recurrence (Bao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2012). Conclusion(s): The assumption that hyperthermia can sensitize glioma stemlike cells to radiation has been recently verified by Man et al. (2015). The EBRT plus (HIFU generated) FH treatments deserve, in our opinion, a large scale trial to give a new therapeutic perspective to this devastating pathology.",Excluded,0.10444409

No changes in the paraventricular nuclei were observed, whereas cells of the supraoptic nuclei were activated.

The colchicine-binding protein in procine-brain tissue is a dimer of molecular weight 110,000 that is believed to be the subunit of neuronal microtubules. Conditions are established under which the dimers aggregate with reproducible kinetics. This aggregation reaction, which is monitored by development of turbidity, has the following characteristics: (a) Colchicine inhibits development of turbidity; (b) the reaction inhibited by colchicine is reversed by long-wave ultraviolet irradiation; (c) the aggregation is temperature-dependent; (d) the reaction is nucleotide triphosphate-specific, being stimulated by 1 mM GTP; (e) the reaction appears to be specific for microtubule subunits since in the presence of other added proteins and in curde cell extracts, only microtubule subunits aggregate. On the basis of these criteria, we conclude that we have established an in vitro system for the aggregation of microtubule subunits that shares some of the properties characteristic of the in vivo assembly of cytoplasmic and spindle microtubules.",Excluded,0.102736495

Studies on apoptosis and the influence of UVB radiation on this process have important cognitive aspects. They are a source of information about the interaction between the ultraviolet radiation and the biological material. The purpose of the study was to compare the narrow- and broad-band UVB radiation in terms of its influence on the epidermis apoptosis in experimental animals. Immunohistochemically, the number of apoptosis cells was counted in the epidermis. In 6 consecutive fields of vision measuring 82.4 mum x 82.4 mum, the number of cells with positive PARP reaction was counted. They were counted in three slices in the control group and in each of the experimental groups. The results underwent statistical analysis. Percentages, arithmetic means and standard deviations were calculated. It was proved that UVB radiation leads to enhanced apoptosis in the epidermis. The largest number of apoptotic cells per a surface assessed was observed in the BB-UVB-D experimental group. In this group there were 20 times more apoptotic cells than in the controls. When the number of apoptotic cells was compared between the narrow-band irradiated group and that irradiated with the broad band of UVB, the latter was found to induce about three times more apoptotic cells than the former did. The data obtained after the analysis of the results allowed for a comparative evaluation of the both radiation wavebands, which was also important from the clinical point of view.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of electromagnetic fields (EMF) on the workers' circulatory system, and to find out to what extent the EMF frequency, short-term (maximum values) and chronic (daily and lifetime doses) exposures influence the type of the observed disorders. The gathered data will help to evaluate whether hygiene standards that limit maximum admissible EMF values (e.g., ICNIRP standards) protect against adverse effects of exposure. The study covered workers employed in transformer and distribution stations, medium wave transmitting stations, radio-service and radio and TV multichannel broadcasting stations. In all the cases, exposure levels were considerably lower than those set as admissible according to the ICNIRP standards. Nevertheless changes in the circulatory system and a significant relationship between blood pressure and neurovegetative regulation disorders and exposure parameters were observed. The frequency of changes in the circulatory system was significantly dependent not only on the maximum EMF value, but also on its dose, which indicates that the hygiene standards for EMF cannot be limited only to short-term exposure maximum values, but they should be supplemented with dose-related standards.",Excluded,0.10438088
444,"Solar ultraviolet-B exposure and cancer incidence and mortality in the United States, 1993-2002. BACKGROUND: An inverse relationship between solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) exposure and non-skin cancer mortality has long been reported. Vitamin D, acquired primarily through exposure to the sun via the skin, is believed to inhibit tumor development and growth and reduce mortality for certain cancers.METHODS: We extend the analysis of this relationship to include cancer incidence as well as mortality, using higher quality and higher resolution data sets than have typically been available. Over three million incident cancer cases between 1998 and 2002 and three million cancer deaths between 1993 and 2002 in the continental United States were regressed against daily satellite-measured solar UV-B levels, adjusting for numerous confounders. Relative risks of reduced solar UV-B exposure were calculated for thirty-two different cancer sites.RESULTS: For non-Hispanic whites, an inverse relationship between solar UV-B exposure and cancer incidence and mortality was observed for ten sites: bladder, colon, Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, other biliary, prostate, rectum, stomach, uterus, and vulva. Weaker evidence of an inverse relationship was observed for six sites: breast, kidney, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreas, and small intestine. For three sites, inverse relationships were seen that varied markedly by sex: esophagus (stronger in males than females), gallbladder (stronger in females than males), and thyroid (only seen in females). No association was found for bone and joint, brain, larynx, liver, nasal cavity, ovary, soft tissue, male thyroid, and miscellaneous cancers. A positive association between solar UV-B exposure and cancer mortality and incidence was found for anus, cervix, oral cavity, melanoma, and other non-epithelial skin cancer.CONCLUSION: This paper adds to the mounting evidence for the influential role of solar UV-B exposure on cancer, particularly for some of the less-well studied digestive cancers. The relative risks for cancer incidence are similar to those for cancer mortality for most sites. For several sites (breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, other biliary, vulva), the relative risks of mortality are higher, possibly suggesting that the maintenance of adequate vitamin D levels is more critical for limiting tumor progression than for preventing tumor onset. Our findings are generally consistent with the published literature, and include three cancer sites not previously linked with solar UV-B exposure, to our knowledge: leukemia, small intestine, and vulva.",Excluded,0.10438828
445,"Parkinson's disease and melanoma: Co-occurrence and mechanisms. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, depletion of dopamine in the striatum and the presence of Lewy bodies. Cancer is uncontrolled growth of cells in the body and migration of these cells from their site of origin to other parts of the body. PD and cancer are two opposite diseases, one arising from cell proliferation and the other from cell degeneration. This fundamental difference is consistent with inverse comorbidity between most cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. However, a positive association of PD and melanoma has been reported which has recently become of significant interest. A link between PD and cancer has been supported by many epidemiological studies, most of which show that PD patients have a lower risk of developing most cancers than the general population. However, the mechanisms underlying this epidemiological observation are not known. In this review we focus on epidemiological studies correlating PD and melanoma and the possible mechanisms underlying the co-occurrence of the two diseases. We explore possible explanations for the important observations that more PD patients develop melanoma that would otherwise be expected and vice-versa. Copyright © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to evaluate a prospectively initiated two-center protocol of risk-adapted stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in patients with acromegaly.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total 35 patients (16 men/19 women, mean age 54 years) were prospectively included in a treatment protocol of SRS [planning target volume (PTV < 4 ccm, > 2 mm to optic pathways = low risk] or SRT (PTV >= 4 ccm, <= 2 mm to optic pathways = high risk). The mean tumor volume was 3.71 ccm (range: 0.11-22.10 ccm). Based on the protocol guidelines, 21 patients were treated with SRS and 12 patients with SRT, 2 patients received both consecutively.RESULTS: The median follow-up (FU) reached 8 years with a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 87.3% [confidence interval (CI): 70.8-95.6%] and 5-year local control rate of 97.1% (CI: 83.4-99.8%). Almost 80% (28/35) presented tumor shrinkage during FU. Endocrinological cure was achieved in 23% and IGF-1 normalization with reduced medication was achieved in 40% of all patients. An endocrinological response was generally achieved within the first 3 years, but endocrinological cure can require more than 8 years.

448,"Effects of 900 MHz radiofrequency on corticosterone, emotional memory and neuroinflammation in middle-aged rats. The widespread use of mobile phones raises the question of the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF, 900 MHz) on the brain. Previous studies reported increased levels of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the rat's brain after a single exposure to 900 MHz global system for mobile (GSM) signal, suggesting a potential inflammatory process. While this result was obtained in adult rats, no data is currently available in older animals. Since the transition from middle-age to senescence is highly dependent on environment and lifestyle, we studied the reactivity of middle-aged brains to EMF exposure. We assessed the effects of a single 15 min GSM exposure (900 MHz; specific absorption rate (SAR)=6 W/kg) on GFAP expression in young adults (6 week-old) and middle-aged rats (12 month-old). Brain interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6, plasmatic levels of corticosterone (CORT), and emotional memory were also assessed. Our data indicated that, in contrast to previously published work, acute GSM exposure did not induce astrocyte activation. Our results showed an IL-1beta increase in the olfactory bulb and enhanced contextual emotional memory in GSM-exposed middle-aged rats, and increased plasmatic levels of CORT in GSM-exposed young adults. Altogether, our data showed an age dependency of reactivity to GSM exposure in neuro-immunity, stress and behavioral parameters.

Background This study aimed to explore whether statins reduce radiation-induced vascular complications in cancer patients postradiotherapy to the thorax, head, and neck. Methods and Results We conducted a retrospective cohort study within a provincial linked database of 5718 cardiac patients with thorax and head or neck cancer having undergone radiotherapy between 2000 and 2011. One thousand five hundred fifty-two patients were identified as nonstatin users and 4166 as statin users. The primary outcome of interest was the composite of cerebrovascular (transient ischemic attack, and fatal or nonfatal stroke) or cardiovascular events (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction). Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed. The crude event rate was 10.31% for nonusers and 9.03% for statin users (hazard ratio of 0.92 [95% CI 0.76-1.10, P=0.3451]), over a mean time to event/censoring of 534+/-687 days for nonusers and 594+/-706 days for the statin users.

450,"Local delivery of angiogenesis-inhibitor minocycline combined with radiotherapy and oral temozolomide chemotherapy in 9L glioma: Laboratory investigation. Object. Over the past several years, there has been increasing interest in combining angiogenesis inhibitors with radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy in the treatment of glioblastoma. Although the US FDA approved bevacizumab for the treatment of glioblastoma in 2009, the European Medicines Agency rejected its use due to its questionable impact on patient survival. One factor contributing to the failure of angiogenesis inhibitors to increase overall patient survival may be their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Here the authors examined in a 9L glioma model whether intracranial polymer-based delivery of the angiogenesis inhibitor minocycline potentiates the effects of both radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy in increasing median survival. The authors also investigated whether the relative timing of minocycline polymer implantation with respect to radiotherapy affects the efficacy of radiotherapy. Methods. Minocycline was incorporated into the biodegradable polymer polyanhydride poly(1,3-bis-[p-carboxyphenoxy propane]-co-[sebacic anhydride]) (CPP:SA) at a ratio of 50:50 by weight. Female Fischer 344 rats were implanted with 9L glioma on Day 0. The minocycline polymer was then implanted on either Day 3 or Day 5 posttumor implantation. Cohorts of rats were exposed to 20 Gy focal radiation on Day 5 or were administered oral temozolomide (50 mg/kg daily) on Days 5-9. Results. Both minocycline polymer implantations on Days 3 and 5 increased survival from 14 days to 19 days (p < 0.001 vs control). Treatment with a combination of both minocycline polymer and radiotherapy on Day 5 resulted in a 139% increase in median survival compared with treatment with radiotherapy alone (p < 0.005). There was not a statistically significant difference in median survival between the group that received minocycline implanted on the same day as radiotherapy and the group that received minocycline polymer 2 days prior to radiotherapy. Lastly, treatment with a combination of minocycline polymer with oral temozolomide resulted in a 38% extension of median survival compared with treatment of oral temozolomide alone (p < 0.001). Conclusions. These results show that minocycline delivered locally potentiates the effects of both radiotherapy and oral temozolomide in increasing median survival in a rodent glioma model. More generally, these results suggest that traditional therapy in combination with local, as opposed to systemic, delivery of angiogenesis inhibitors may be able to increase median survival for patients with glioblastoma. ©AANS, 2014.",Excluded,0.257007

Fatigue is one of the most common and distressing side effects of cancer and its treatment, and may persist for years after treatment completion in otherwise healthy survivors. Guided by basic research on neuro-immune interactions, a growing body of research has examined the hypothesis that cancer-related fatigue is driven by activation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine network. In this review, we examine the current state of the evidence linking inflammation and cancer-related fatigue, drawing from recent human research and from experimental animal models probing effects of cancer and cancer treatment on inflammation and fatigue. In addition, we consider two key questions that are currently driving research in this area: what are the neural mechanisms of fatigue, and what are the biological and psychological factors that influence the onset and/or persistence of inflammation and fatigue in cancer patients and survivors?

452,"Effects of oxygen and bFGF on the vulnerability of photoreceptors to light damage. PURPOSE: To test whether tissue oxygen levels affect the vulnerability of photoreceptors to damage by bright continuous light (BCL).METHODS: Albino rats were raised in standard conditions of cyclic light (12-hour light, 12-hour darkness) with the light level at 5 to 10 lux or 40 to 65 lux. They were then exposed to BCL (1000-1400 lux), either continuously for 48 hours or for the day or night components of the 48-hour period. During BCL, some rats were kept in room air (normoxia, 21% oxygen), some in hypoxia (10%), and some in hyperoxia (70%). Their retinas were examined for cell death, for the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and for response to light (electroretinogram, ERG).RESULTS: The death of retinal cells induced by BCL was confined to photoreceptors. Within the retina, the severity of death was inversely related to the level of bFGF immunolabeling in the somas of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) before exposure. The death of photoreceptors was accompanied by an upregulation of bFGF protein levels in the ONL and by a decline in the ERG. Both hypoxia and hyperoxia during BCL reduced the photoreceptor death, bFGF upregulation, and ERG decline caused by BCL. The protective effects of hyperoxia and hypoxia were evident during both the day and night halves of the daily cycle. Hypoxia or hyperoxia alone did not upregulate bFGF or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) expression in the retina.CONCLUSIONS: Photoreceptors are protected from light damage by hypoxia and hyperoxia during exposure. The protection provided by oxygen levels operates during both day and night. The protection is not mediated by an upregulation of bFGF or CNTF.",Excluded,0.1049093

They have irregular borders making surgical resection difficult and require much higher doses of radiation to achieve a favorable clinical and radiographic response. Little research has been performed to determine the role of SRS in sarcomas of the spine. The goal of this institutional analysis is to evaluate the role of SRS in primary and metastatic spinal or paraspinal sarcomas. Materials/Methods: Patients with pathologically confirmed sarcomas that received spine SRS at our institution between June 2001 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed after obtaining IRB approval. EMRs of clinical exams, and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated. Post treatment pain control, neurological improvement, and radiographic tumor control were the primary endpoints of this study. Result(s): A total of 23 patients treated to 78 vertebral levels were included. The average age of the cohort was 57 years. 45% of the patients were male and 55% were female. 64% were Caucasian, 27% African American, and 9% were of other ethnicities. The median surgical dose was 18 Gy in a single fraction (range 10-20) prescribed to the 90% isodose line. Median follow-up time was 3 months. 14 patients were deceased with a median survival of 14.6 months. Leiomyosarcoma was the most common histology among the cohort with 9 patients. Other histologies included- Ewing's (3), osteosarcoma (2), neufibrosarcoma (2), liposarcoma (2), chondrosarcoma (1), hemangiopercytoma (1), rhabdomyoblastic anaplastic (1), spindle cell (1), and unspecified sarcoma(1). The average tumor volume was 53.12 cc (range 2.02-207.25cc). Overall pain response was 75% (25% partial & 50% complete relief). Pain was stable in 25% of the patients, and no pain progression was observed. Total neurological response was 25% (0% complete, 25% partial). 94% of the patients were neurologically stable or improved after treatment. In one patient (6%) a progressed neurological deficit was observed. Total radiographic response was 67% (0% complete, 29% partial, 38% stable). Local tumor progression was observed in 33% of the patients. One patient initially had a partial radiographic response that progressed after 10 months. Another patient was initially stable but experienced radiographic progression after three months. Eight vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) were noted, two of which may be attributed to SRS. No other adverse effects were observed. Conclusion(s): A total of 23 patients and 78 spinal levels were treated with SRS resulting in fairly good response rates for pain relief, neurologic improvement, and radiographic tumor response (75%, 25%, & 67% respectively).

To determine whether this drug could be used for the treatment of non-NAT expressing tumours following genetic manipulation, we previously showed that plasmid mediated transfection of NAT into a non-NAT expressing glioblastoma cell line, UVW, endowed the host cells with the capacity to actively accumulate [131I]MIBG. We now present data defining the conditions required for complete sterilisation of NAT transfected cells cultured as multicellular spheroids and treated with [131I]MIBG. METHOD(S): NAT transfected UVW cells, grown as monolayers and spheroids, were treated with various doses of [131I]MIBG and assessed for cell kill by clonogenic survival and measurement of spheroid volume over time (growth delay). Spheroids were left intact for different time periods to assess the effect of radiation crossfire on cell death. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): Total clonogen sterilisation was observed when the cells were grown as three-dimensional spheroids and treated with 7 MBq/ml [131I]MIBG. The added benefit of radiation crossfire was demonstrated by the improvement in cell kill achieved by prolongation of the maintenance of [131I]MIBG treated spheroids in their three-dimensional form, before disaggregation and clonogenic assay. When left intact for 48 h after treatment, spheroid cure was achieved by exposure to 6 MBq/ml [131I]MIBG. These results demonstrate that the efficiency of cell kill by [131I]MIBG targeted therapy is strongly dependent on beta-particle crossfire irradiation. This gene therapy/targeted radiotherapy strategy has potential for [131I]MIBG mediated cell kill in tumours other than those derived from the neural crest.",Excluded,0.22604096
455,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases. Worldwide, approximately 100,000 patients have undergone stereotactic radiosurgery for a variety of intracranial lesions, of which brain metastases represent the most common treatment indication. This article summarizes the major issues surrounding the management of brain metastases, and also analyzes 21 independent reports of Gamma Knife- or linear accelerator-based radiosurgery, representing over 1,700 patients and more than 2,700 lesions. Variable reporting in the studies precludes a definitive, rigorous analysis, but the composite data reveal an average local control rate of 83% and median survival of 9.6 months, both of which are comparable to results in recent surgical reports. The most important prognostic factors for survival appear to be fewer than three lesions, controlled extracranial disease, and Karnofsky performance score (KPS). The exact impact of dose has not been clarified, but a dose-response relationship, especially for > or = 18 Gy, is emerging. The role of whole-brain radiotherapy remains unresolved. It may enhance local control but does not convincingly improve survival and, in some series, is associated with an increased risk of late complications. Chronic steroid dependence and increased intracranial edema do not appear to be common problems. This is an opportune time for the completion of ongoing randomized trials to validate these observations. [References: 46]",Excluded,0.107347496
456,"Zero echo time MRI-only treatment planning for radiation therapy of brain tumors after resection. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the sole imaging modality for patient modeling in radiation therapy (RT) is a challenging task due to the need to derive electron density information from MRI and construct a so-called pseudo-computed tomography (pCT) image. We have previously published a new method to derive pCT images from head T1-weighted (T1-w) MR images using a single-atlas propagation scheme followed by a post hoc correction of the mapped CT numbers using local intensity information. The purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of our method with head zero echo time (ZTE) MR images. To evaluate results, the mean absolute error in bins of 20 HU was calculated with respect to the true planning CT scan of the patient. We demonstrated that applying our method using ZTE MR images instead of T1-w improved the correctness of the pCT in case of bone resection surgery prior to RT (that is, an example of large anatomical difference between the atlas and the patient).",Excluded,0.10240041
457,"Otolith adaptive responses to altered gravity. The force of gravity has remained constantly present over the course of animal evolution and forms our frame of reference with the environment, including spatial orientation, navigation, gaze and postural stability. Inertial head accelerations occur within this gravity frame of reference naturally during voluntary movements and perturbations. Execution of movements of aquatic, terrestrial and flight species widely differ, but the sensory systems detecting acceleration forces, including gravity, have remained remarkably conserved among vertebrates. The utricular organ senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. A sudden or persistent change in gravitational force would be expected to have profound and global effects on an organism. Physiological data collected immediately after orbital missions, after short and extended increases in gravity load via centrifugation, and after readaptation to normal gravity exist in the toadfish model. This review focuses on the otolith adaptive responses to changes in gravity in a number of model organisms and their potential impact on human space travel.",Excluded,0.10196763

Within the first day postflight, the magnitude of response to an applied translation was on average three times greater than for controls. The reduced gravitational acceleration in orbit apparently resulted in an upregulation of the sensitivity of utricular afferents. By 30 h postflight, responses were statistically similar to control.

PURPOSE: The purpose of phase 1 was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of motexafin gadolinium (MGd) given concurrently with temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation therapy (RT) in patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Phase 2 determined whether this combination improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in GBM recursive partitioning analysis class III to V patients compared to therapies for recently published historical controls.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dose escalation in phase 1 progressed through 3 cohorts until 2 of 6 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity or a dose of 5 mg/kg was reached. Once MTD was established, a 1-sided 1-sample log-rank test at significance level of .1 had 85% power to detect a median survival difference (13.69 vs 18.48 months) with 60 deaths over a 12-month accrual period and an additional 18 months of follow-up. OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: In phase 1, 24 patients were enrolled. The MTD established was 5 mg/kg, given intravenously 5 days a week for the first 10 RT fractions, then 3 times a week for the duration of RT. The 7 patients enrolled in the third dose level and the 94 enrolled in phase 2 received this dose. Of these 101 patients, 87 were eligible and evaluable. Median survival time was 15.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.9-17.6 months), not significantly different from that of the historical control (P=.36). Median PFS was 7.6 months (95% CI: 5.7-9.6 months). One patient (1%) experienced a grade 5 adverse event possibly related to therapy during the concurrent phase, and none experience toxicity during adjuvant TMZ therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment was well tolerated, but median OS did not reach improvement specified by protocol compared to historical control, indicating that the combination of standard RT with TMZ and MGd did not achieve a significant survival advantage.",Excluded,0.10385765

Objective(s): To describe and correlate total oral transit time (TOTT) with functional performance in MND using different food consistencies. Method(s): The study was conducted on 20 patients with MND, regardless of type or duration of the disease, of whom nine were excluded due to issues on the videofluoroscopic swallowing images. The remaining 11 patients (nine men and two women) ranged from 31 to 87 years of age (mean: 57 years) with scores on the Penetration Aspiration Scale ranging from <= 2 to <= 4.

Videofluoroscopy of swallowing using 5ml of different consistencies was performed and a quantitative temporal analysis of the TOTT was carried out with the aid of specific software. Result(s): There was a wide variation in the TOTT within the same food consistency among MND patients. There was a correlation between the TOTT and overall functional performance for the thickened liquid consistency (r = -0.691) and between the TOTT and bulbar performance for the pureed consistency (r = -0.859).

Therefore, the authors evaluated the long term efficacy and toxicity of treatment with radiotherapy and concurrent carboplatin plus teniposide followed by three cycles of carmustine in patients who underwent resection for glioblastoma.METHODS: Fifty-six newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma underwent radiotherapy (1.8-2 gray [Gy]/day, 5 days a week using limited fields up to 60 Gy), and concurrent chemotherapy with carboplatin (350 mg/m2) on Days 1, 22, and 43, and teniposide (50 mg/m2) on Days 1, 2, 3, 22, 23, 24, 43, 44, and 45. Four weeks after the end of radiotherapy, patients were given carmustine (200 mg/m2) every 8 weeks for 3 cycles. Treatment then was suspended, but if disease progression was found, treatment was resumed using different drugs.RESULTS: All 56 patients were evaluated for time to progression (TTP) and median survival time (MST). The TTP was 7.5 months and the MST was 12.5 months. Toxicity manifested as thrombocytopenia and in most cases was acceptable. Four patients (7.1%) had radiation necrosis at 2, 2, 7, and 9 months, respectively, from the end of radiotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in the current study with concurrent radiochemotherapy in patients with glioblastoma are comparable to the best results reported using radiotherapy alone followed by chemotherapy with nitrosoureas.",Excluded,0.11075806
465,"Evidence that peripheral rather than intracranial thermal signals induce thermoregulation. Numerous effector mechanisms have been discovered, which change body temperature and thus serve to maintain the thermal integrity of homeothermic animals. These mechanisms are driven by thermal signals that are processed by neurons in the hypothalamic preoptic area. To keep a tight control over body temperature, these neurons have to receive accurate thermal information. Although in vitro studies have shown the direct thermosensitive ability of neurons in the preoptic area, other observations suggest the existence of peripheral thermosensation and an ascending thermal pathway to the thermoregulatory center. Direct evidences for either one, or both are still missing. In the present study, brain, rectal, subcutaneous and skin surface temperatures were measured during 15, 30, 60 and 120 min of cold exposure (4 degrees C) in rats and compared with neuronal activation due to cold stress shown by c-fos in situ hybridization histochemistry. Subcutaneous and skin surface temperatures dropped continuously throughout the 120 min of cold exposure by 1.4 degrees C and 6.5 degrees C, respectively. However, during the first 30 min, brain and rectal temperatures increased by 0.3 degrees C and 0.25 degrees C, respectively, and even after 60 min of cold stress, brain temperature did not decrease under the level measured at 0 min. Since the brain temperature did not decrease, it is unlikely that intracranial thermoreceptors are involved in the transmission of ""cold"" thermal signal to induce thermoregulation. At 30 min of cold exposure, neurons in all known thermoregulatory areas (like the ventrolateral part of the medial preoptic nucleus, the lateral retrochiasmatic area, the lateral parabrachial nucleus and the peritrigeminal nucleus) were already maximally activated. These observations clearly indicate that the activation of neurons in the preoptic and several other thermoregulatory nuclei is induced in vivo by thermal signals originating in the periphery, and not in the CNS.",Excluded,0.10306815

Temperature transduction in mammals is possible because of the presence of a set of temperature-dependent transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in dorsal root ganglia neurons and skin cells. Six thermo-TRP channels, all characterized by their unusually high temperature sensitivity (Q10 > 10), have been cloned: TRPV1-4 are heat activated, whereas TRPM8 and TRPA1 are activated by cold. Because of the lack of structural information, the molecular basis for regulation by temperature remains unknown. In this study, we assessed the role of the C-terminal domain of thermo-TRPs and its involvement in thermal activation by using chimeras between the heat receptor TRPV1 and the cold receptor TRPM8, in which the entire C-terminal domain was switched. Here, we demonstrate that the C-terminal domain is modular and confers the channel phenotype regarding temperature sensitivity, channel gating kinetics, and PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphophate) modulation. Thus, thermo-TRP channels contain an interchangeable specific region, different from the voltage sensor, which allows them to sense temperature stimuli.",Excluded,0.10289394

470,"The contribution of imaging-based treatment planning quality assurance rounds in head and neck radiotherapy planning. Purpose/Objective(s): While standard guidelines for Intensity Modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) may assist in target delineation for some head and neck (HN) cancers, the complex anatomy, varying patterns of spread, frequent occurrence of unusual or advanced presentations, and risk of treatment-related toxicities from overly generous delineation render HN treatment planning (TP) very challenging. Since 2007 we have had weekly Treatment Planning Quality Assurance (TPQA) rounds with radiation oncologists and a specialized diagnostic neuroradiologist present to review TP contours for all new patients. This study quantifies the impact of this process. Materials/Methods: From 8/2010 - 2/2011, IMRT contours for 84 consecutively treated HN cancer patients were reviewed. Almost always, pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was reviewed independently and fused in multiple orientations to the computed tomography TP scan using a commercial software package; thus the contours could be viewed by the group directly opposed to the MRI if desired. Pre- and post-TPQA rounds contours were saved. For this study, the pre- and post-TPQA contours were compared to record alterations in the coverage of major components (gross tumor, clinical target volume (CTV), lymph nodes, perineural invasion, or bone invasion) and the volume of change. Result(s): The tumors were mostly advanced stage (III-IV) and included various subsites: oral cavity (21%), oropharynx (19%), sinonasal (12%), skin (12%), nasopharynx (10%), salivary gland (8%), and hypopharynx (6%). Of the 84 cases, 47 (56%) were altered, including: CTV, 30/47 cases (64%); gross tumor, 25/47 cases (53%); lymph nodes, 7/47 (15%); perineural invasion, 6/47 (13%); and bone invasion, 3/47 (6%). The absolute volume change resulting from TPQA review ranged from -169.12 cc to 124.76 cc (0.03% to 636.88% of absolute pre-TPQAvolume), with a mean absolute change of 32.32 cc (39.48%) and a median change of 13.54 cc (8.96%). Volumes were equally likely to be increased (49%) or decreased (51%). The most frequently altered subsites were: hypopharynx (4/5, 80%), sinonasal (7/10, 70%), and skin (7/10, 70%). Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates the impact of a neuroradiology-based approach to HN TPQA. Changes were suggested to half of the cases, and the changes were equally likely to increase or decrease the target volume, suggesting a balance between tumor coverage and desire to avoid toxicity. High frequencies of changes were seen in delineation of gross tumor and CTVs because of the wide applicability of these issues, but in addition, there are specific anatomic subsites with challenging patterns of infiltrative, intracranial, or perineural spread which warrant intensive imaging-based review in collaboration with a diagnostic specialist.",Excluded,0.10336646

Tumor necrosis a (TNF) is a key mediator of many acute injuries to the liver, including alcoholic liver injury, viral hepatitis and ischemia reperfusion injury. Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is an important clinical problem for several organs including brain, heart, kidney, and liver. Hepatic I/R injuries occur during transplantation, liver resection for tumor, and circulatory shock. Possible consequences of hepatic I/R injury include liver failure and/or multi-organ system failures, resulting in morbidity and mortality. Hepatic I/R injury produces two types of cell death, apoptosis and necrosis in hepatocytes and non parenchymal cells. Several intracellular signaling molecules are activated by I/R including NFkB and c-Jun N terminal kinase, (JNK). JNK is phosphorylated and activated by several types of stresses, including stimulation by cytokines, such as TNFalpha and IL-1, and environmental stresses such as radiation and oxidant stress. Substrates for JNK include the transcription factors c-Jun and ATF-2. Recent studies have proposed that activated JNK may also directly affect mitochondria through undefined substrates leading to apoptosis. JNK is strongly induced during warm hepatic I/R injury and during the cold ischemial warm repetition injury of liver transplantation.

PURPOSE: [(18)F]UCB-H is a novel radiotracer with a high affinity for synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), a protein expressed in synaptic vesicles. SV2A is the binding site of levetiracetam, a ""first-in-class"" antiepileptic drug with a distinct but still poorly understood mechanism of action. The objective of this study was to determine the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of [(18)F]UCB-H in a human clinical trial and to establish injection limits according to biomedical research guidelines. Additionally, the clinical radiation dosimetry results were compared to estimations in previously published preclinical data.PROCEDURES: Dynamic whole body positron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging was performed over approximately 110 min on five healthy male volunteers after injection of 144.5 +/- 7.1 MBq (range, 139.1-156.5 MBq) of [(18)F]UCB-H. Major organs were delineated on CT images, and time-activity curves were obtained from co-registered dynamic PET emission scans. The bladder could only be delineated on PET images. Time-integrated activity coefficients were calculated as area under the curve using trapezoidal numerical integration. Urinary excretion data based on PET activities including voiding was also simulated using the dynamic bladder module of OLINDA/EXM. The radiation dosimetry was calculated using OLINDA/EXM.RESULTS: The effective dose to the OLINDA/EXM 70-kg standard male was 1.54 x 10(-2) +/- 6.84 x 10(-4) millisieverts (mSv)/MBq, with urinary bladder wall, gallbladder wall, and the liver receiving the highest absorbed dose.

478,"Sparing of normal tissues with volumetric arc radiation therapy for glioblastoma: Single institution clinical experience. Background: Patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) require radiotherapy as part of definitive management.

Here we report our clinical experience by analyzing target coverage and sparing of OARs for 90 clinical treatment plans. Method(s): VMAT and IMRT patient cohorts comprising 45 patients each were included in this study. For all patients, the planning target volume (PTV) received 50Gy in 30 fractions, and the simultaneous integrated boost PTV received 60Gy. The characteristics of the two patient cohorts were examined for similarity. The doses to target volumes and OARs, including brain, brainstem, hippocampi, optic nerves, eyes, and cochleae were then compared using statistical analysis. Target coverage and normal tissue sparing for six patients with both clinical IMRT and VMAT plans were analyzed. Result(s): PTV coverage of at least 95% was achieved for all plans, and the median mean dose to the boost PTV differed by only 0.1Gy between the IMRT and VMAT plans. Superior sparing of the brainstem was found with VMAT, with a median difference in mean dose being 9.4Gy. The ipsilateral cochlear mean dose was lower by 19.7Gy, and the contralateral cochlea was lower by 9.5Gy. The total treatment time was reduced by 5min. The difference in the ipsilateral hippocampal D<inf>100%</inf> was 12Gy, though this is not statistically significant (P=0.03). Conclusion(s): VMAT for GBM patients can provide similar target coverage, superior sparing of the brainstem and cochleae, and be delivered in a shorter period of time compared with IMRT. The shorter treatment time may improve clinical efficiency and the quality of the treatment experience. Based on institutional clinical experience, use of VMAT for the treatment of GBMs appears to offer no inferiority in comparison to IMRT and may offer distinct advantages, especially for patients who may require re-irradiation.

479,"Modulation of pain perception by transcranial magnetic stimulation of left prefrontal cortex. Evidence by functional imaging studies suggests the role of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in the inhibitory control of nociceptive transmission system. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is able to modulate pain response to capsaicin. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of DLPFC activation (through rTMS) on nociceptive control in a model of capsaicin-induced pain. The study was performed on healthy subjects that underwent capsaicin application on right or left hand. Subjects judged the pain induced by capsaicin through a 0-100 VAS scale before and after 5 Hz rTMS over left and right DLPFC at 10 or 20 min after capsaicin application in two separate groups (8 subjects each). Left DLPFC-rTMS delivered either at 10 and 20 min after capsaicin application significantly decreased spontaneous pain in both hands. Right DLPFC rTMS showed no significant effect on pain measures. According to these results, stimulation of left DLPFC seems able to exert a bilateral control on pain system, supporting the critical antinociceptive role of such area. This could open new perspectives to non-invasive brain stimulation protocols of alternative target area for pain treatment.",Excluded,0.10341183
480,"The impact of colonic resection for neoplasia on functional outcomes and related quality of life: A case-controlled study. Introduction Aim Functional outcomes after elective colectomy (right, left or sigmoid) for neoplasia are poorly reported in the literature. This study evaluates bowel function and related quality of life in patients 2 - 4 years after hemicolectomy, comparing the results to healthy controls. Methods Eligible patients were identified from prospectively maintained colorectal databases at two teaching hospitals. Patients were recruited during regular follow up visits or by telephone interview. Patient relatives with an intact colon were recruited as controls. Study exclusion criteria were poor cognitive ability, inflammatory bowel disease, metastatic disease, previous pelvic radiation, prior colonic, stomach or small bowel resection, bypass surgery, vagotomy, an existing stoma and anal incontinence. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) questionnaire was used to assess bowel function and the EQ-5D questionnaire to assess quality of life (QOL). Parametric and non-parametric tests were used with log transformation and regression methods for skewed data. Association between EQ-5D and MSKCC scores was examined with Spearman's rank correlation. Results A total of 85 patients (mean age 69 +/- 11.2 years) and 85 controls (mean age 58.2 +/- 13.4 years) were recruited in 12 months. Patients reported a significantly higher number of bowel movements per day than controls (2 versus 1, P < 0.001). Initial analysis suggested that patients had a significantly lower total MSKCC score (group difference mean -3.1, CI -5.8 to -0.4, p = 0.02), indicating worse bowel function in the patient group. Following adjustment for age, sex and co-morbidities, differences in total score were no longer significant, but the patient group had a lower score for the frequency subscale and the ability to control flatus (p = 0.008 and p = < 0.001). MSKCC frequency scores were worse after right-sided resections (p = 0.03). High scores for complete emptying and the differentiation between wind and solid had a positive correlation with better QOL (p = 0.007 and 0.02 respectively). There was a nonsignificant decrease in the overall QOL (EQ-5D p = 0.6, EQ-VAS p = 0.12) following hemicolectomy compared with controls. Conclusion Colonic resection has an adverse effect on bowel frequency with worse outcomes following right hemicolectomy. Good colonic function, as assessed by the MSKCC questionnaire, is associated with better QOL.",Excluded,0.84772646

The position of the telephone during use justifies public concerns that electromagnetic waves may affect the central nervous system. We review here some studies of the potential neurotoxic effects of the radiofrequencies emitted by mobile phones, that is, of potential injury at structural, functional, electrophysiological, behavioural or neural development levels. The numerous reports do not show any clear effect at any of these levels, and based on what we know today, mobile telephone radiofrequencies do not seem neurotoxic. This review found a wide variety of protocols measuring a wide variety of indicators and characteristics.

482,"Radiosurgery of the rat hippocampus: magnetic resonance imaging, neurophysiological, histological, and behavioral studies. OBJECTIVE: To explore the histological, electrophysiological, radiological, and behavioral effects of radiosurgery using a new model of proton beam radiosurgery (PBR) of the rodent hippocampus.METHODS: Forty-one rats underwent PBR of the right hippocampus with nominal doses of 5 to 130 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE). Three control animals were untreated. Three months after PBR, 41 animals were evaluated with the Morris water maze, 23 with T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and 22 with intrahippocampal microelectrode recordings. Animals that were studied physiologically were killed, and their brains were examined with Nissl staining and immunocytochemical staining for glutamic acid decarboxylase, heat shock protein 72 (HSP-72), parvalbumin, calmodulin, calretinin, calbindin, and somatostatin.RESULTS: Ninety and 130 CGE resulted in decreased performance in the Morris water maze, increased signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, diminished granule cell field potentials, and tissue necrosis, which was restricted to the irradiated side. These doses also resulted in ipsilateral up-regulation of calbindin and HSP-72. Parvalbumin was down-regulated at 130 CGE. The 30 and 60 CGE animals displayed a marked increase in HSP-72 staining on the irradiated side but no demonstrable cell loss. No asymmetries were noted in somatostatin, calretinin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase staining. Normal physiology was found in rats receiving up to 60 CGE.CONCLUSION: This study expands our understanding of the effects of radiosurgery on the mammalian brain. Three months after PBR, the irradiated rat hippocampus demonstrates necrosis at 90 CGE, but not at 60 CGE, with associated abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging, physiology, and memory testing. HSP-72 was up-regulated at nonnecrotic doses.",Included,0.92407876
483,"Low (20 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe-particle radiation lead to a persistent reduction in the spatial learning ability of rats. Exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is considered to be a potential health risk in long-term space travel, and it represents a significant risk to the central nervous system (CNS). The most harmful component of GCR is the HZE [high-mass, highly charged (Z), high-energy] particles, e.g. <sup>56</sup>Fe. In previous ground-based experiments, exposure to high doses of HZE-particle radiation induced pronounced deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in rodents. Recent data suggest that glutamatergic transmission in hippocampal synaptosomes is impaired after low (60 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles, which could lead to impairment of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. To assess the effects of mission-relevant (2060 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles on hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, male Wistar rats either received sham treatment or were irradiated and tested 3 months later in the Barnes maze test. Compared to the controls, rats that received 20, 40 and 60 cGy 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles showed significant impairments in their ability to locate the escape box in the Barnes maze, which was manifested by progressively increasing escape latency times over the 3 days of testing. However, this increase was not due to a lack of motivation of the rats to escape, because the total number of head pokes (and especially incorrect head pokes) remained constant over the test period. Given that rats exposed to X rays did not exhibit spatial memory impairments until >10 Gy was delivered, the RBE for 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe-particle-induced hippocampal spatial memory impairment is ~50. These data demonstrate that mission-relevant doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles can result in severe deficits in hippocampus-dependent neurocognitive tasks, and the extreme sensitivity of these processes to 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles must arise due to the perturbation of multiple processes in addition to killing neuronal cells. © 2012 by Radiation Research Society.

484,"Spatial Memory Performance of Socially Mature Wistar Rats is Impaired after Exposure to Low (5 cGy) Doses of 1 GeV/n <sup>48</sup>Ti Particles. Prolonged deep space missions to planets and asteroids will expose astronauts to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), a mixture of low-LET ionizing radiations, high-energy protons and high-Z and energy (HZE) particles. Ground-based experiments are used to determine whether this radiation environment will have an effect on the long-term health of astronauts and their ability to complete various tasks during their mission. Emerging data suggest that mission-relevant HZE doses impair several hippocampus-dependent neurocognitive processes in rodents, but that there is substantial interindividual variation in the severity of neurocognitive impairment, ranging from no observable effects to severe impairment. While the majority of studies have established the effect that the most abundant HZE species (<sup>56</sup>Fe) has on neurocognition, some studies suggest that the lighter <sup>48</sup>Ti HZE particles may be equally, if not more, potent at impairing neurocognition. In this study, we assessed the effect that exposure to 5-20 cGy 1 GeV/n <sup>48</sup>Ti had on the spatial memory performance of socially mature male Wistar rats. Acute exposures to mission-relevant doses (<=5 cGy) of 1 GeV/n <sup>48</sup>Ti significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the mean spatial memory performance of the rats at three months after exposure, and significantly (P < 0.015) increased the percentage of rats that have severe (Z score >= 2) impairment, i.e., poor performers.

485,"Impaired Attentional Set-Shifting Performance after Exposure to 5 cGy of 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si Particles. Astronauts on deep space missions will be required to work more autonomously than on previous missions, and thus their ability to perform executive functions could be critical to mission success. One of the most common measures of executive function in humans is the ability to perform attentional set shifting, which requires contributions from working memory, discrimination, reversal learning, attentional set shifting and attention. Rodent attentional set shifting assays require rats to form an association between the presence of the food reward and an associative cue, which is either the digging media or the scent that is placed in the bowl; by altering the combination of scent and digging media, progressively more complex cognitive processes can be tested. In this study, we have determined the effect that exposure to 5-20 cGy of 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si particles has on the ability of male retired breeder Wistar rats to perform attentional set shifting at three months postirradiation. All doses of Si resulted in a significant impairment in the ability of the rats to perform the first and most simple step of the ATSET assay, the simple discrimination (SD) task. If astronauts were to experience HZE-induced SD impairments, they would be unable to identify key factors to successfully resolve a situation. Performance in at least one other component of the ATSET test was impaired at all doses studied, however, these varied according to the dose. Compared with our previous studies using 1 GeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe and <sup>48</sup>Ti particles, 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si ions impaired attentional set-shifting performance at lower doses than the heavier ions. However, when the effect of isofluences of the three HZE ions were compared, there were no significant differences in the severity of the impaired performance; there were, however, ion-specific decrements in the ability of rats to perform within the various stages of the test. This study further supports the notion that ""mission-relevant"" doses of HZE particles (<20 cGy) can impair certain aspects of attentional set-shifting performance in retired breeder rats, but there may be some ion-specific changes in the specific cognitive domains impaired.",Included,0.9231143
486,"Comparison of a flexible versus a rigid breast compression paddle: pain experience, projected breast area, radiation dose and technical image quality. PURPOSE: To compare pain, projected breast area, radiation dose and image quality between flexible (FP) and rigid (RP) breast compression paddles.METHODS: The study was conducted in a Dutch mammographic screening unit (288 women). To compare both paddles one additional image with RP was made, consisting of either a mediolateral-oblique (MLO) or craniocaudal-view (CC). Pain experience was scored using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Projected breast area was estimated using computer software. Radiation dose was estimated using the model by Dance. Image quality was reviewed by three radiologists and three radiographers.RESULTS: There was no difference in pain experience between both paddles (mean difference NRS: 0.08 +/- 0.08, p = 0.32). Mean radiation dose was 4.5 % lower with FP (0.09 +/- 0.01 p = 0.00). On MLO-images, the projected breast area was 0.79 % larger with FP. Paired evaluation of image quality indicated that FP removed fibroglandular tissue from the image area and reduced contrast in the clinically relevant retroglandular area at chest wall side.CONCLUSIONS: Although FP performed slightly better in the projected breast area, it moved breast tissue from the image area at chest wall side. RP showed better contrast, especially in the retroglandular area. We therefore recommend the use of RP for standard MLO and CC views.",Excluded,0.10554305
487,"Rheological characterization of the nucleus pulposus and dense collagen scaffolds intended for functional replacement. Lumbar discectomy is an effective therapy for neurological decompression in patients suffering from sciatica due to a herniated nucleus pulposus (NP). However, high numbers of patients suffering from persisting postoperative low back pain have resulted in many strategies targeting the regeneration of the NP. For successful regeneration, the stiffness of scaffolds is increasingly recognized as a potent mechanical cue for the differentiation and biosynthetic response of (stem) cells. The aim of the current study is to characterize the viscoelastic properties of the NP and to develop dense collagen scaffolds with similar properties. The scaffolds consisted of highly dense (0.5%-12%) type I collagen matrices, prepared by plastic compression. The complex modulus of the NP was 22 kPa (at 10 rad s(-1)), which should agree with a scaffold with a collagen concentration of 23%. The loss tangent, indicative of energy dissipation, is higher for the NP (0.28) than for the scaffolds (0.12) and was not dependent of the collagen density. Gamma sterilization of the scaffolds increased the shear moduli but also resulted in more brittle behavior and a reduced swelling capacity. In conclusion, by tuning the collagen density, we can approach the stiffness of the NP. Therefore, dense collagen is a promising candidate for tissue engineering of the NP that deserves further study, such as the addition of other proteins.",Excluded,0.101648584

Background and purpose: Proton therapy is increasingly used to treat primary brain tumors. There is concern for higher rates of pseudoprogression (PsP) after protons compared to photons. The purposes of this study are to compare the rate of PsP after proton vs. photon therapy for grade II and III gliomas and to identify factors associated with the development of PsP. Material(s) and Method(s): Ninety-nine patients age >18 years with grade II or III glioma treated with photons or protons were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, IDH and 1p19q status, and treatment factors were analyzed for association with PsP, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Sixty-five patients were treated with photons and 34 with protons. Among those with oligodendroglioma, PsP developed in 6/42 photon-treated patients (14.3%) and 4/25 proton-treated patients (16%, p = 1.00). Among those with astrocytoma, PsP developed in 3/23 photon-treated patients (13%) and 1/9 proton-treated patients (11.1%, p = 1.00). There was no difference in PsP rate based on radiation type, radiation dose, tumor grade, 1p19q codeletion, or IDH status. PsP occurred earlier in oligodendroglioma patients treated with protons compared to photons, 48 days vs. 131 days, p <.01.

Background: Consistent delineation of patient anatomy becomes increasingly important with the growing use of highly conformal and adaptive radiotherapy techniques. This study investigates the magnitude and 3D localization of interobserver variability of organs at risk (OARs) in the head and neck area with application of delineation guidelines, to establish measures to reduce current redundant variability in delineation practice. Method(s): Interobserver variability among five experienced radiation oncologists was studied in a set of 12 head and neck patient CT scans for the spinal cord, parotid and submandibular glands, thyroid cartilage, and glottic larynx. For all OARs, three endpoints were calculated: the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), the Concordance Index (CI) and a 3D measure of variation (3D SD). Result(s): All endpoints showed largest interobserver variability for the glottic larynx (ICC = 0.27, mean CI = 0.37 and 3D SD = 3.9 mm). Better agreement in delineations was observed for the other OARs (range, ICC = 0.32-0.83, mean CI = 0.64-0.71 and 3D SD = 0.9-2.6 mm). Cranial, caudal, and medial regions of the OARs showed largest variations. All endpoints provided support for improvement of delineation practice.

The authors assess the efficacy of brachytherapy of uveal melanomas in 954 patients. Strontium ophthalmoapplicators were used in 652, rutenium ones in 302 patients. As a rule, Sr applicators were sutured in patients with tumors up to 3.5 mm thick and Ru ones in cases with tumors thicker than 3.5 mm. A special program was used for individual approach and improving the accuracy of planning. A total of 74.5% of patients have been followed up for at least 3 years, with check-ups every 3-6 months. The effect of brachytherapy was considered positive in cases with complete resorption or at least 50% decrease of the tumor and a stable clinical picture for 9-12 months. In 60% of patients the tumor regressed completely, in 16% partially, and in 24% there were signs of activation of melanoma growth one year after treatment. The frequency of radiation complications was as follows: retinopaty, 3.15%; neuroretinopathy, 1.1%; hemophthalmia, 0.9%; neovascular glaucoma, 1.1%; cataract, 0.63%.

493,"Molecular architecture of a complex between an adhesion protein from the malaria parasite and intracellular adhesion molecule 1. The adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to human tissues or endothelium is central to the pathology caused by the parasite during malaria. It contributes to the avoidance of parasite clearance by the spleen and to the specific pathologies of cerebral and placental malaria. The PfEMP1 family of adhesive proteins is responsible for this sequestration by mediating interactions with diverse human ligands. In addition, as the primary targets of acquired, protective immunity, the PfEMP1s are potential vaccine candidates. PfEMP1s contain large extracellular ectodomains made from CIDR (cysteine-rich interdomain regions) and DBL (Duffy-binding-like) domains and show extensive variation in sequence, size, and domain organization. Here we use biophysical methods to characterize the entire ~300-kDa ectodomain from IT4VAR13, a protein that interacts with the host receptor, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). We show through small angle x-ray scattering that IT4VAR13 is rigid, elongated, and monomeric. We also show that it interacts with ICAM-1 through the DBLbeta domain alone, forming a 1:1 complex. These studies provide a first low resolution structural view of a PfEMP1 ectodomain in complex with its ligand. They show that it combines a modular domain arrangement consisting of individual ligand binding domains, with a defined higher order architecture that exposes the ICAM-1 binding surface to allow adhesion.",Excluded,0.10147133
494,"Meditation experience predicts less negative appraisal of pain: electrophysiological evidence for the involvement of anticipatory neural responses. The aim of mindfulness meditation is to develop present-focused, non-judgmental, attention. Therefore, experience in meditation should be associated with less anticipation and negative appraisal of pain. In this study we compared a group of individuals with meditation experience to a control group to test whether any differences in the affective appraisal of pain could be explained by lower anticipatory neural processing. Anticipatory and pain-evoked ERPs and reported pain unpleasantness were recorded in response to laser stimuli of matched subjective intensity between the two groups. ERP data were analysed after source estimation with LORETA. No group effects were found on the laser energies used to induce pain. More experienced meditators perceived the pain as less unpleasant relative to controls, with meditation experience correlating inversely with unpleasantness ratings. ERP source data for anticipation showed that in meditators, lower activity in midcingulate cortex relative to controls was related to the lower unpleasantness ratings, and was predicted by lifetime meditation experience. Meditators also reversed the normal positive correlation between medial prefrontal cortical activity and pain unpleasantness during anticipation. Meditation was also associated with lower activity in S2 and insula during the pain-evoked response, although the experiment could not disambiguate this activity from the preceding anticipation response. Our data is consistent with the hypothesis that meditation reduces the anticipation and negative appraisal of pain, but effects on pain-evoked activity are less clear and may originate from preceding anticipatory activity.

Two HLH regulatory proteins that function to suppress neuronal development in other tissues, extra macrochaetae (emc) and hairy (h), are expressed ahead of the morphogenetic furrow. While neither h nor emc is required for photoreceptor cell determination, in emc-h-clones the morphogenetic furrow and differentiated eye field advance up to eight ommatidial rows ahead of adjacent wild-type tissue.

In 2007, the patient was found to have sacral and coccygeal tumors with recommended observation. In 2011, with progressive lower limb weakness thought attributable to the masses, he received radiation following biopsy. He presented with progressive symptoms in 2013 and was found to have marked lower limb weakness and a mixed Trendelenburg and steppage gait. He minimized his weakness and was pain focused. Setting(s): Academic medical center. Results or Clinical Course: Electrodiagnostic studies revealed diffuse myopathy without neurogenic injury referable to the sacrococcygeal masses. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed paraspinal atrophy in addition to the sacral and coccygeal masses, for which biopsy revealed chordoma and glomangioma, respectively. Upon discussing test results, the patient revealed a strong family history of adult-onset muscular dystrophy, which he had not offered originally. Discussion(s): Chordomas and glomangiomas are rare tumors. This is the first case report of these occurring simultaneously. Although symptoms vary based upon location, both commonly present with localized pain. Chordomas are malignant spinal bone tumors and glomangiomas are benign mesenchymal neoplasms. For our patient, the myopathy diagnosis was confounded by the tumors, which were assumed to cause lower limb weakness. The distribution of weakness and location of the tumors were discordant and further evaluation revealed myopathy as the cause of the lower limb weakness, likely due to familial muscular dystrophy. Conclusion(s): We report the first case of chordoma and glomangioma occurring concomitantly. This case highlights 1) even in close anatomic proximity, bony masses may represent different pathologies with distinct prognoses and treatments, and 2) the importance of a good clinical examination in expanding the differential diagnosis when the clinical deficit pattern is distinct from what is anticipated based on imaging.",Excluded,0.10419699

Adenosine A1 receptors are ubiquitous mediators of presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmission in the central nervous system, yet the signalling pathway linking A1 receptor activation and decreased neurotransmitter release remains poorly resolved. We tested the contribution of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to adenosine A1 receptor-mediated depression of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in area CA1 of the rat hippocampus. We found that inhibition of JNK with SP600125 or JNK inhibitor V, but not an inactive analogue, attenuated the depression of fEPSPs induced by adenosine, hypoxia, and the A1 receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA). In contrast, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 did not inhibit GABA(B)-mediated synaptic depression. In support of our electrophysiological findings, Western blot analysis showed that A1 receptor stimulation resulted in a transient increase in JNK phosphorylation in the membrane fraction of hippocampal lysates. The total amount of JNK in the membrane fraction was unchanged by CPA treatment. The increase in phosphorylated JNK induced by A1 receptor stimulation was blocked by the A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), indicating that A1 receptors specifically activate JNK in the hippocampus. Together with functional data indicating that JNK inhibition decreased CPA-induced paired pulse facilitation, these results suggest that JNK activation is necessary for adenosine A1 receptor-mediated synaptic depression occurring at a presynaptic locus The adenosine A1 receptor-JNK signalling pathway may represent a novel mechanism underlying inhibition of neurotransmitter release in the CNS.",Excluded,0.10325747
501,"Functional imaging of the brain in the evaluation of drug response and its application to the study of aging. Functional neuroimaging techniques including single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) can provide insight into the functional connectivity of the human brain in both health and disease, including the effects of aging and drugs on brain function. Neuroimaging measurement techniques can either be direct, using radiospecific ligands, or indirect, using the neurophysiological consequences of pharmacological interventions. Both approaches can be combined with sensorimotor or cognitive activation to examine the interaction between the targeted receptor function and the sensorimotor or cognitive process implicit in the study design. Using radionuclides, PET can provide absolute measurement of cerebral blood flow to regions of interest and can measure changes in cerebral metabolism using labelled fluorodeoxyglucose. PET offered the first opportunity to image brain activation caused by a variety of stimuli and hence to measure the effect of drugs on brain activation. PET also enables the study of drug disposition within the brain. SPECT has been used to study relative changes in cerebral blood flow associated with disease processes and also receptor occupancy. FMRI, by contrast, does not involve ionising radiation and has better spatial and temporal resolution. It is still a relatively new technique and limited by its ability to only measure haemodynamic changes through the blood oxygen lever dependent (BOLD) signal.

502,"ADC texture--an imaging biomarker for high-grade glioma?. PURPOSE: Survival for high-grade gliomas is poor, at least partly explained by intratumoral heterogeneity contributing to treatment resistance. Radiological evaluation of treatment response is in most cases limited to assessment of tumor size months after the initiation of therapy. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its estimate of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) has been widely investigated, as it reflects tumor cellularity and proliferation. The aim of this study was to investigate texture analysis of ADC images in conjunction with multivariate image analysis as a means for identification of pretreatment imaging biomarkers.METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive high-grade glioma patients were treated with radiotherapy (2 Gy/60 Gy) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide. ADC maps and T1-weighted anatomical images with and without contrast enhancement were collected prior to treatment, and (residual) tumor contrast enhancement was delineated. A gray-level co-occurrence matrix analysis was performed on the ADC maps in a cuboid encapsulating the tumor in coronal, sagittal, and transversal planes, giving a total of 60 textural descriptors for each tumor. In addition, similar examinations and analyses were performed at day 1, week 2, and week 6 into treatment. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensionality of the data, and the five largest components (scores) were used in subsequent analyses. MRI assessment three months after completion of radiochemotherapy was used for classifying tumor progression or regression.RESULTS: The score scatter plots revealed that the first, third, and fifth components of the pretreatment examinations exhibited a pattern that strongly correlated to survival. Two groups could be identified: one with a median survival after diagnosis of 1099 days and one with 345 days, p = 0.0001.CONCLUSIONS: By combining PCA and texture analysis, ADC texture characteristics were identified, which seems to hold pretreatment prognostic information, independent of known prognostic factors such as age, stage, and surgical procedure.

504,"Delayed puberty in the male Djungarian hamster: effect of short photoperiod or melatonin treatment on the GnRH neuronal system. The effect of short days or timed melatonin treatments on the number and neuroanatomical location of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons was studied in the brain of the pubertal male Djungarian hamster. At the beginning of the rapid phase of testicular growth and onset of peak gonadotropin secretion (15 days of age), males were treated for 10 days with either short days (10 L:14 D; n = 6), or remained in long days (16 L:8 D; n = 5) and injected each afternoon with melatonin. These treatments arrested testicular growth compared to the gonadal development that occurred in long-day controls (n = 9). Every brain section (60 microns) from the olfactory bulb to the anterior hypothalamus was processed for GnRH immunocytochemistry and viewed under brightfield light microscopy. GnRH cell bodies had smooth contours and were morphologically bipolar or unipolar. The number of bipolar neurons was similar regardless of treatment (about 170/brain). However, fewer unipolar GnRH cell bodies (p less than 0.05) were found in males in short days (73 +/- 11) or in males administered melatonin (72 +/- 14) compared to the unipolar number in hamsters in long days (132 +/- 14). With respect to neuroanatomical distribution, significantly fewer unipolar GnRH neurons were found in the medial preoptic area of males treated with short days or melatonin (55-70% decrease) compared to cell numbers in long-day controls. The melatonin-treated hamsters also had reduced numbers of unipolar GnRH neurons in the diagonal band of Broca relative to the number of unipolar neurons in long-day controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded,0.11981537
505,"Acute encephalopathy in the setting of paraplegia secondary to metastatic melanoma to the lumbar spine: A case report. Case/Program Description: The patient presented to outpatient neurosurgeon's office for chronic lower back pain and with radiation into the right buttock. Initial MRI of the lumbar spine with and without contrast showed a right sided nerve sheath tumor of L4 root level. Differential included benign nerve sheath/nerve tumor, sarcoma, ganglioneuroma, lymphoma or metastatic disease. Three months later the patient presented to ED with acute worsening of lower back pain, right leg weakness and urinary incontinence. Repeat MRI of the lumbar spine revealed an aggressive infiltrating soft tissue mass at the lumbosacral junction with compression of L4-5 vertebral bodies with compression of cord from L4-S3. CT guided biopsy pathology confirmed malignant melanoma. Dermatologic evaluation was negative for primary cutaneous source. She was admitted to inpatient rehabilitation to increase independence in setting of new paraplegia and urinary incontinence. On morning rounds, during inpatient rehabilitation, she was noted to have altered mental status. MRI brain revealed new onset hydrocephalus as well as evidence of pial enhancement along the pons and ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Cytology of CSF confirmed leptomeningeal involvement of melanoma. Setting(s): Inpatient Acute Rehabilitation Center. Result(s): The patient continued to have decline in neurologic function and intermittent encephalopathy, requiring multiple hospitalizations and eventual transition to palliative care. Discussion(s): This case is representative of the neurological effects of metastatic melanoma and the aggressiveness of the disease when no cutaneous primary source is identified. Differential diagnosis of acute encephalopathy in this setting includes, medication side effects, stroke, hydrocephalus, leptomeningeal spread, and systemic infection.

506,"Range modulation in proton therapy planning: a simple method for mitigating effects of increased relative biological effectiveness at the end-of-range of clinical proton beams. BACKGROUND: The increase in relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of proton beams at the distal edge of the spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) is a well-known phenomenon that is difficult to quantify accurately in vivo. For purposes of treatment planning, disallowing the distal SOBP to fall within vulnerable tissues hampers sparing to the extent possible with proton beam therapy (PBT). We propose the distal RBE uncertainty may be straightforwardly mitigated with a technique we call ""range modulation"". With range modulation, the distal falloff is smeared, reducing both the dose and average RBE over the terminal few millimeters of the SOBP.METHODS: One patient plan was selected to serve as an example for direct comparison of image-guided radiotherapy plans using non-range modulation PBT (NRMPBT), and range-modulation PBT (RMPBT). An additional plan using RMPBT was created to represent a re-treatment scenario (RMPBTrt) using a vertex beam. Planning statistics regarding dose, volume of the planning targets, and color images of the plans are shown.RESULTS: The three plans generated for this patient reveal that in all cases dosimetric and device manufacturing advantages are able to be achieved using RMPBT. Organ at risk (OAR) doses to critical structures such as the cochleae, optic apparatus, hypothalamus, and temporal lobes can be selectively spared using this method. Concerns about the location of the RBE that did significantly impact beam selection and treatment planning no longer have the same impact on the process, allowing these structures to be spared dose and subsequent associated issues.CONCLUSIONS: This present study has illustrated that RMPBT can improve OAR sparing while giving equivalent coverage to target volumes relative to traditional PBT methods while avoiding the increased RBE at the end of the beam. It has proven easy to design and implement and robust in our planning process. The method underscores the need to optimize treatment plans in PBT for both traditional energy dose in gray (Gy) and biologic dose (RBE).",Excluded,0.10308642

Interferons alpha and beta have been reported to cause tumor regression in a small proportion of patients with recurrent glioma. Eflornithine, an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, reduces cellular polyamine levels and has also been reported to cause tumor regression in patients with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme. In vitro evidence suggests that interferon and eflornithine are synergistic. In this phase II trial, we investigated the combination of recombinant alpha interferon (36 x 10(6) units/m2 subcutaneously days 3 to 7) and eflornithine (2.25 g/m2 QID PO days 1 to 7) repeated every 28 days. All 29 patients entered in the study were evaluable for toxicity and efficacy. Toxicity consisted primarily of fever, chills, myalgia, weakness and fatigue as well as cortical dysfunction including somnolence, confusion, and exacerbation of underlying neurologic deficits. One patient died from cerebral herniation attributable to interferon. None of the patients experienced objective tumor regression. Seven patients (24%) were stable for more than six months, but the disease stability could also be explained by indolent underlying disease or inability to distinguish recurrent tumor from delayed radiation effects.

512,"Sleep under extreme environments: effects of heat and cold exposure, altitude, hyperbaric pressure and microgravity in space. Human sleep is sensitive to the individual's environment. The present review examines current knowledge of human sleep patterns under different environments: heat exposure, cold exposure, altitude, high pressure and microgravity in space. Heat exposure has two effects. In people living in temperate conditions, moderate heat loads (hot bath, sauna) prior to sleep provoke a delayed reaction across time (diachronic reaction) whereby slow-wave sleep (SWS) augments in the following night (neurogenic adaptive pathway). Melanoids and Caucasians living in the Sahel dry tropical climate experience diachronic increases in SWS throughout seasonal acclimatization. Such increases are greater during the hot season, being further enhanced after daytime exercise. On the contrary, when subjects are acutely exposed to heat, diachronic decreases in total sleep time and SWS occur, being often accompanied by synchronic (concomitant) diminution in REM sleep. Stress hormones increase. Nocturnal cold exposure provokes a synchronic decrease in REM sleep along with an activation of stress hormones (synchronic somatic reaction). SWS remains undisturbed as it still occurs at the beginning of the night before nocturnal body cooling. Altitude and high pressure are deleterious to sleep, especially in non-acclimatized individuals. In their controlled environment, astronauts can sleep well in microgravity. Exercise-induced sleep changes help to understand environmental effects on sleep: well-tolerated environmental strains may improve sleep through a neurogenic adaptive pathway; when this ""central"" adaptive pathway is overloaded or bypassed, diachronic and synchronic sleep disruptions occur.

The physiological signaling mechanisms that link normal variations in body energy status to the activity of arousal- and metabolism-regulating brain centers are not well understood. The melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin/hypocretin types of neurons of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) exert opposing effects on arousal and metabolism. We examined whether shifts in brain extracellular glucose that correspond to physiological changes in blood glucose can alter the electrical output of neurochemically and biophysically defined LH cells in mouse brain slices. Here, we show that physiologically relevant concentrations of glucose dose-dependently enhance the electrical excitability of MCH neurons by inducing depolarization and increasing membrane resistance. We also demonstrate that the same physiological shifts in glucose have the opposite effects on the electrical activity of orexin neurons. We propose that these direct actions of glucose on the arousal- and metabolism-regulating LH neurons play a key role in the translation of normal variations in body energy resources into appropriate changes in arousal and metabolism.",Excluded,0.10257623

The temporal dynamics of the response of neurons in the outer retina were investigated by intracellular recording from cones, bipolar, and horizontal cells in the intact, light-adapted retina of the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum), with special emphasis on comparing the two major classes of bipolars cells, the ON depolarizing bipolars (Bd) and the OFF hyperpolarizing bipolars (Bh). Transfer functions were computed from impulse responses evoked by a brief light flash on a steady background of 20 cd/m(2). Phase delays ranged from about 89 ms for cones to 170 ms for Bd cells, yielding delays relative to that of cones of about 49 ms for Bh cells and 81 ms for Bd cells. The difference between Bd and Bh cells, which may be due to a delay introduced by the second messenger G-protein pathway unique to Bd cells, was further quantified by latency measurements and responses to white noise. The amplitude transfer functions of the outer retinal neurons varied with light adaptation in qualitative agreement with results for other vertebrates and human vision. The transfer functions at 20 cd/m(2) were predominantly low pass with 10-fold attenuation at about 13, 14, 9.1, and 7.7 Hz for cones, horizontal, Bh, and Bd cells, respectively. The transfer function from the cone voltage to the bipolar voltage response, as computed from the above measurements, was low pass and approximated by a cascade of three low pass RC filters (""leaky integrators""). These results for cone-->bipolar transmission are surprisingly similar to recent results for rod-->bipolar transmission in salamander slice preparations. These and other findings suggest that the rate of vesicle replenishment rather than the rate of release may be a common factor shaping synaptic signal transmission from rods and cones to bipolar cells.",Excluded,0.10305949

De novo cavernous malformation (CM) formation after radiation therapy for brain tumors is well known, but CM formation adjacent to a radiosurgically treated arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is rare.<sup>1</sup> This video demonstrates the microsurgical resection of a de novo CM adjacent to a previously treated high-grade AVM and clipping of a middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm. A 70-yr-old male with history of radiosurgery for AVM presented with aphasia and confusion. Preoperative angiography showed complete occlusion of the AVM. MRI showed multiple cystic lesions suspicious for radiation-induced necrosis and CM. IRB approval and patient consent was obtained. A pterional craniotomy was performed with transsylvian exposure of the insula. The radiated feeding arteries were followed to the occluded AVM nidus. A CM was noted deep to this candelabra of the MCA vessels, which were mobilized to access and resect the CM. A small incision was made in this insular cortex underneath the malformation circumferentially freeing it of adhesions. The sclerotic AVM nidus was circumferentially dissected and removed en bloc. Thorough exploration of the resection cavity revealed no residual CM or AVM nidus. Attention was then turned to the M2-MCA bifurcation aneurysm, which was occluded with a straight clip. Postoperative imaging confirmed complete CM resection. The patient recovered from his aphasia. This case demonstrates the management of a radiation-induced de novo CM following treatment of a high-grade AVM. Radiographic follow-up for radiosurgically treated AVM is needed to rule out long-term complications.

We have successfully integrated previously established Intracranial window (ICW) technology (1-4) with intravital 2-photon confocal microscopy to develop a novel platform that allows for direct long-term visualization of tissue structure changes intracranially. Imaging at a single cell resolution in a real-time fashion provides supplementary dynamic information beyond that provided by standard end-point histological analysis, which looks solely at 'snap-shot' cross sections of tissue. Establishing this intravital imaging technique in fluorescent chimeric mice, we are able to image four fluorescent channels simultaneously. By incorporating fluorescently labeled cells, such as GFP+ bone marrow, it is possible to track the fate of these cells studying their long-term migration, integration and differentiation within tissue. Further integration of a secondary reporter cell, such as an mCherry glioma tumor line, allows for characterization of cell:cell interactions. Structural changes in the tissue microenvironment can be highlighted through the addition of intra-vital dyes and antibodies, for example CD31 tagged antibodies and Dextran molecules. Moreover, we describe the combination of our ICW imaging model with a small animal micro-irradiator that provides stereotactic irradiation, creating a platform through which the dynamic tissue changes that occur following the administration of ionizing irradiation can be assessed. Current limitations of our model include penetrance of the microscope, which is limited to a depth of up to 900 mum from the sub cortical surface, limiting imaging to the dorsal axis of the brain. The presence of the skull bone makes the ICW a more challenging technical procedure, compared to the more established and utilized chamber models currently used to study mammary tissue and fat pads (5-7).

523,"Tumor stage dependent contribution of bone marrow derived cells to tumor neo-vascularization. Introduction: The role of bone marrow derived cells (BMDC) in tumor neo-vascularization remains controversial. We have previously demonstrated that BMDC contribute to tumor neovascularization by differentiating into vascular support cells and not endothelial cell. In this study we focus on establishing the spatiotemporal role of BMDC in tumor neovascularisation, focusing on whether it is a tumor growth stage dependent process and more specifically examining the patterns of BMDC integration into tumor vasculature in response to radiation therapy (RTx). Method(s): Animal Models: Bone marrow of NOD/SCID mice were stably reconstituted with BM harvested from green-fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice. Intracranial (ic) xenografts were generated in intracranial window models (ICW) using a panel of glioma cell and breast cancer cells stably expressing mCherry. In-vivo imaging: Two-photon laser capture microscopy was used to obtain high-resolution real-time in-vivo longitudinal images of the tumor cells, tumor vasculature and tracing of the circulating GFP+BM cells. Mice were imaged 1d,2d,3d,7d,10d,14d,21d & <sup>30</sup>d following cell implantation or RTx. Brain Tumor Analysis: Mice were sacrificed using perfusion fixation and brains collected for correlative immunohistochemical and Immunofluorscent confocal analysis. RTx: Using in-house designed x-ray micro-irradiator stereotactic radiation was delivered through ICW to ic-xenografts, treated with either 3x2Gy or 3x5Gy. Tumor+RTx was compared to RTx alone or tumor alone (n=15 each arm). Result(s): At early stages of tumor formation (<1wk) there is 90% integration of BMDC into the tumor vasculature, while to late stages of tumor growth (>2 wks) only 10% integration of BMDC is seen. At later stages of tumor growth (>2 wks) BMDC incorporation in the tumor vasculature is predominantly seen in the tumor periphery compared to the tumor centre, with the peripheral vessels demonstrating almost 100% integration of BMDC compared to the centre of the tumor where the vasculature have no integration of BMDC. Conclusion(s): Our results are the first to demonstrate that there is a specific tumor growth stage dependent contribution of BMDC to tumor neo-vascularization. At early stages of tumor growth neo-ascularization relies on host BMDC, while at later stages of tumor growth vascularization relies on branching of pre-existing vessels. A significant difference in extent of BMDC integration is noted between periphery versus the centre of the tumor, suggesting that the internal tumor micro-environment regulates neoascularization differently from the periphery. Intriguingly, this distinction is not seen with tumor neovascularization in recurrent tumors following RTx. These results have significant therapeutic implications and point to a need for scheduling of anti-angiogenic therapies according to tumor growth stage and timing post RTx.",Excluded,0.9038695

Background: In patients with MRI brain scans consistent with unresectable glioma, the current standard of care is to confirm with a stereotactic biopsy. However, stereotactic biopsy is not without clinical risk. Method(s): A series of 181 patients who underwent stereotactic biopsy for malignant brain lesions between 2006 - 2014 was reviewed with particular attention to risk of near-term neurologic decline and death. Result(s): In the evaluable set of 158 patients, the median age was 63. 77.2% of the patients had Grade 4 tumors, while 20.9% had a pre-biopsy performance status (PS) of ECOG 3-4. The overall risk of death within 30 days of biopsy was 13.9%. Neurological decline directly attributable to the biopsy occurred in 19.7% of patients, while 5.3% experienced both neurologic decline and death within 30 days. The rate of death within 30 days of stereotactic biopsy for grade 2/3 tumors was 5.6%, grade 4 tumors was 16.4% and patients > 65 was 18.2%. The 30-day rate of death and neurologic decline attributable to biopsy in patients with pre-treatment ECOG 3-4 was 21.2% (vs. 12% ECOG 0-2, p = 0.067) and 35.7% (vs. 15.4% ECOG 0-2, p = 0.064), respectively.

We investigated the pathophysiology of pain flare through assessment of changes in urinary cytokines/chemokines in patients receiving EBRT for painful bone metastases.METHODS: Urine samples were collected from patients receiving a single 8 Gy fraction for painful bone metastases preparation, day 1 or 2 and on an additional day between days 3 to 5 post radiation. Patients completed a standardized pain and analgesic use diary daily for 10 days following radiation. Patients were deemed to have pain flare if they had a two-point increase from baseline worst pain on 0-10 scale and no decrease in analgesic intake or a 25% increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in worst pain. The Millipore Milliplex 42-Plex Cyto-kine/Chemokine Kit TM was used to measure urinary levels of a panel of cytokines/chemokines.RESULTS: Forty-six patients consented to the study of which 28 were evaluable (complete urine and diary data), and 83/84 urine samples were available for analysis. Pain flare was experienced by 11 patients (39%). The following cytokines/chemokines were detectable in at least 50% of the patients: EGF, fractalkine, GRO, IL-4, IL-8, interferon gamma induced protein 10 (IP-10), MCP-1, macrophage derived chemokine (MDC), PDGF-AA, sIL-2Ra, TGF-Alpha, VEGF. Comparing patients with or without pain flare EGF, fractalkine, GRO, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MDC, sIL-2Ra, and TGF-alpha increased following radiation in both groups. Patients with pain flare have significant lower levels on IL-8, IP-10, and MDC over time.

Responses to SPN stimulation that were conditioned by vibration were reduced in 66% of trials (by 33+/-12% in tibialis anterior and 40+/-16% in soleus). These reductions in electromyographic activity are unlikely to be mediated by changes at the Ia synapse or motoneuron because vibration did not alter the magnitude of the soleus H reflex. The electromyographic reductions may involve long-lasting neuromodulatory effects on spinal inhibitory interneurons or synapses involved in the flexor reflex pathway. Vibration-evoked depression of electromyographic activity may be clinically useful in controlling involuntary muscle contractions after SCI.",Excluded,0.10365888

532,"Functional connectivity between secondary and primary motor areas underlying hand-foot coordination. Coincident hand and foot movements are more reliably performed in the same direction than in opposite directions. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess motor cortex function, we examined the physiological basis of these movements across three novel experiments. Experiment 1 demonstrated that upper limb corticomotor excitability changed in a way that facilitated isodirectional movements of the hand and foot, during phasic and isometric muscle activation conditions. Experiment 2 demonstrated that motor cortex inhibition was modified with active, but not passive, foot movement in a manner that facilitated hand movement in the direction of foot movement. Together, these findings demonstrate that the coupling between motor representations within motor cortex is activity dependent. Because there are no known connections between hand and foot areas within primary motor cortex, experiment 3 used a dual-coil paired-pulse TMS protocol to examine functional connectivity between secondary and primary motor areas during active ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and supplementary motor area (SMA) conditioning, but not ventral premotor cortex (PMv) conditioning, produced distinct phases of task-dependent modulation of excitability of forearm representations within primary motor cortex (M1). Networks involving PMd-M1 facilitate isodirectional movements of hand and foot, whereas networks involving SMA-M1 facilitate corticomotor pathways nonspecifically, which may help to stabilize posture during interlimb coordination. These results may have implications for targeted neurorehabilitation after stroke.",Excluded,0.10245782
533,"Efficacy of carboplatin and paclitaxel therapy in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the anal canal. Background: Development of distant metastases in SCC of the anal canal is not very common after treatment with combined modality. Only widely published data for treatment of metastatic disease is cisplatin and 5-FU. Carboplatin and paclitaxel is commonly used in squamous cancer of the lung but its efficacy in SCC of the anal cancer is unclear. The objective of this study is to determine the tolerability and outcome of patients with SCC of the anal canal treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel at Moffitt Cancer Center. Method(s): Retrospective analysis was conducted looking at Moffitt Cancer tumor registry from 1/2007 to 1/2012. Eligible patients were required to have diagnosis of SCC of the anal cancer and received carboplatin/paclitaxel every 3 weeks as part of the treatment. Result(s): 13 patients fulfilled the criteria. 11 patients were initially diagnosed with early stage (Stage I-III). 11 patients received concurrent chemo radiation (Nigro regimen or cisplatin + 5-FU) and had reoccurrence. 2 patients were initially diagnosed with Stage IV disease. Median age was 56 years and 77% were females. Upon diagnosis of metastatic disease, 11 patients received prior chemotherapy (cisplatin/5FU, irinotecan/cetuximab, cisplatin/docetaxel). 4/13 patients received 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, 7/13 received only 1 prior regimen and 2/13 did not receive any prior chemotherapy. Patients received an average of 4.7 cycles (1 cycle= 3 weeks). Median was 4 cycles. The response rate was high at 62% with 2 patients achieving complete response and 6 patients with partial response. Grade 3 toxicities included peripheral neuropathy (n= 3), diarrhea (n= 1), and infection (n=3). 4 patients had grade 3 neutropenia and 1 patient had grade 4 anemia. Median progression free survival and overall survival were 4.6 and 10.5 months respectively. Conclusion(s): Carboplatin and paclitaxel seem to be well tolerated and have activity in the treatment of advanced SCC of the anal canal.

The radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic field of magnetic resonance (MR) scanners can result in significant tissue heating due to the RF coupling with the conducting parts of medical implants. The objective of this article is to evaluate the advantages and shortcomings of a new four-tier approach based on a combined numerical and experimental procedure, designed to demonstrate safety of implants during MR scans. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study analyzing this technique. The evaluation is performed for 1.5 T MR scanners using a generic model of a deep brain stimulator (DBS) with a straight lead and a helical lead. The results show that the approach is technically feasible and provides sound and conservative information about the potential heating of implants. We demonstrate that (1) applying optimized tools results in reasonable uncertainties for the overall evaluation; (2) each tier reduces the overestimation by several dB at the cost of more demanding evaluation steps; (3) the implant with the straight lead would cause local temperature increases larger than 18 degreeC at the RF exposure limit for the normal operating mode; (4) Tier 3 is not sufficient for the helical implant; and (5) Tier 4 might be too demanding to be performed for complex implants. We conclude with a suggestion for a procedure that follows the same concept but is between Tier 3 and 4. In addition, the evaluation of Tier 3 has shown consistency with current scan practice, namely, the resulting heat at the lead tip is less than 3.5 degreeC for the straight lead and 0.7 degreeC for the helix lead for scans at the current applied MR scan restrictions for deep brain stimulation at a head average SAR of 0.1 W/kg.",Excluded,0.104169816
537,"Neuronavigation role in the percutaneous treatment of thoracolumbar fractures. Introduction: Application of the neuronavigation techniques to the widely used percutaneous pedicle screw techniques allows to combine the traditional AP and LL intraoperatory fluoroscopy images with three-dimensional reconstruction CT images. The surgeon have very important informations about the axial plane having a real time feedback to the exact spinal surgical anatomy. This makes more ""minimally invasive"" surgical procedure and reduces patients and operators exposure to ionizing radiation. We used this technique in the treatment of Magerl's A2-A3 thoracolumbar fracture. Material(s) and Method(s): From June 2010 thru September 2012, 25 patients (16 male and 9 female) underwent surgical treatment for thoracolumbar hinge (D12-L1) fracture with a completely neuronavigated percutaneous pedicle screw fixation technique using a posterior approach. Inclusions criteria were: monolevel Magerl's A2- A3 thoracolumbar fractures, no posterior wall involvement and/or fragments occupying the spinal canal for more than 25 % according to Hashimoto, McCormack score <=6 with posterior longitudinal ligament's integrity, no neurological deficits. Although the percutaneous neuronavigated techniques are widely used in different centers, in these cases also the pedicle screws were neuronavigated, to make surgical procedure more accurate and precise. The positioning of percutaneous pedicle screw was performed using Stealth 7 Medtronic (Fridley, Minnesota, USA) neuronavigation system with a completely neuronavigated surgical instruments (CD Horizon Longitude) (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). In 2 cases we used real-time 3-D images acquired with O-Arm system to have a further collimation of the neuronavigated data with the acquired images reducing intraoperative fluoroscopic controls. The follow-up provided Rx study in second post-operative day and in 1 and 6 months post-op. Result(s): The percutaneous neuronavigated technique have proved to be useful for the surgeon because in addition to the traditional fluoroscopic AP and LL images, uses three-dimensional reconstruction CT images, viewing also axial projections. In cases in which we used the O-Arm, were appreciated the usefulness of the 3-D images realtime. There were no cases of surgical instrumentation's failure. The patients have been mobilized in the first post-operative day with a more rapid resolution of painful symptoms and returned to perform their work activities more quickly. The Rx post-operative controls at 6 months have demonstrated the correct positioning of the pedicle screws and the correct fusion in 95 % of patients. Conclusion(s): The percutaneously entirely neuronavigated pedicle screws fixation is an effective and safe technique for the treatment of the hinge thoraco-lumbar fractures. The technique used in carefully selected patients reduces the time required for surgery, intraoperative blood loss, and ensures greater anatomical detail making more safely the placement of pedicle screws reducing the risks of ""screw misplacement"".",Excluded,0.10312093
538,"Pharmacological alterations that could underlie radiation-induced changes in associative memory and anxiety. It is widely known that ionizing radiation is a physical agent broadly used to kill tumor cells during human cancer therapy. Unfortunately, adjacent normal tissues can concurrently undergo undesirable cell injury. Previous data of our laboratory demonstrated that exposure of developing rats to ionizing radiations induced a variety of behavioral differences respect to controls, including changes in associative memory and in anxiety state. However, there is a lack of data concerning modifications in different related pharmacological intermediaries. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether the behavioral differences observed in young animals irradiated at birth might be underlain by early changes in PKCs1 levels which, in turn, could lead to changes in hippocampal GABAergic neurotransmission. Male Wistar rats were irradiated with 5Gy of X rays between 24 and 48 h after birth. Different pharmacological markers related to the affected behavioral tasks were assessed in control and irradiated hippocampus at 15 and 30 days, namely GABAA receptor, GAD65-67, ROS and PKCs1. Results showed that all measured parameters were increased in the hippocampus of 30-days-old irradiated animals. In contrast, in the hippocampus of 15-days-old irradiated animals only the levels of PKCs1 were decreased. These data suggest that PKCs1 might constitute a primary target for neonatal radiation damage on the hippocampus. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that an initial decrease in the levels of this protein can trigger a subsequent compensatory increase that, in turn, could be responsible for the plethora of biochemical changes that might underlie the previously observed behavioral alterations.",Excluded,0.924102
539,"Long-lasting effects of neonatal ionizing radiation exposure on spatial memory and anxiety-like behavior. Neonatal ionizing radiation exposure has been shown to induce a cerebellar cytoarchitecture disarrangement. Since cerebellar abnormalities have been linked to an impairment of behavioral functions, the aim of the present work was to investigate whether exposure of developing rats to ionizing radiations can produce behavioral deficits in the adult. Male Wistar rats were X-irradiated with 5Gy within 48h after birth and were tested in a radial maze and in an open field at 30 and 90 days post irradiation. Irradiated rats showed significative changes in spatial, exploratory, and procedural parameters in the radial maze, as well as a significative decrease in anxiety-like behavior, assessed in the open field. These results suggest that ionizing radiations can induce long-lasting spatial memory and anxiety-related changes. A relationship with radiation-induced cerebellar cytoarchitecture abnormalities supports the hypothesis that cerebellar integrity seems to be critical to achieve spatial performance and emotional behavior establishment.",Excluded,0.9241591
540,"Calcium-induced calcium release in rod photoreceptor terminals boosts synaptic transmission during maintained depolarization. We examined the contribution of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) to synaptic transmission from rod photoreceptor terminals. Whole-cell recording and confocal calcium imaging experiments were conducted on rods with intact synaptic terminals in a retinal slice preparation from salamander. Low concentrations of ryanodine stimulated calcium increases in rod terminals, consistent with the presence of ryanodine receptors. Application of strong depolarizing steps (-70 to -10 mV) exceeding 200 ms or longer in duration evoked a wave of calcium that spread across the synaptic terminals of voltage-clamped rods. This secondary calcium increase was blocked by high concentrations of ryanodine, indicating it was due to CICR. Ryanodine (50 microm) had no significant effect on rod calcium current (I(ca)) although it slightly diminished rod light-evoked voltage responses. Bath application of 50 microm ryanodine strongly inhibited light-evoked currents in horizontal cells. Whether applied extracellularly or delivered into the rod cell through the patch pipette, ryanodine (50 microm) also inhibited excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked in horizontal cells by depolarizing steps applied to rods. Ryanodine caused a preferential reduction in the later portions of EPSCs evoked by depolarizing steps of 200 ms or longer. These results indicate that CICR enhances calcium increases in rod terminals evoked by sustained depolarization, which in turn acts to boost synaptic exocytosis from rods.",Excluded,0.10413418
541,"CEST signal at 2ppm (CEST@2ppm) from Z-spectral fitting correlates with creatine distribution in brain tumor. In general, multiple components such as water direct saturation, magnetization transfer (MT), chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and aliphatic nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) contribute to the Z-spectrum. The conventional CEST quantification method based on asymmetrical analysis may lead to quantification errors due to the semi-solid MT asymmetry and the aliphatic NOE located on a single side of the Z-spectrum. Fitting individual contributors to the Z-spectrum may improve the quantification of each component. In this study, we aim to characterize the multiple exchangeable components from an intracranial tumor model using a simplified Z-spectral fitting method. In this method, the Z-spectrum acquired at low saturation RF amplitude (50 Hz) was modeled as the summation of five Lorentzian functions that correspond to NOE, MT effect, bulk water, amide proton transfer (APT) effect and a CEST peak located at +2 ppm, called CEST@2ppm. With the pixel-wise fitting, the regional variations of these five components in the brain tumor and the normal brain tissue were quantified and summarized. Increased APT effect, decreased NOE and reduced CEST@2ppm were observed in the brain tumor compared with the normal brain tissue. Additionally, CEST@2ppm decreased with tumor progression. CEST@2ppm was found to correlate with the creatine concentration quantified with proton MRS. Based on the correlation curve, the creatine contribution to CEST@2ppm was quantified. The CEST@2ppm signal could be a novel imaging surrogate for in vivo creatine, the important bioenergetics marker. Given its noninvasive nature, this CEST MRI method may have broad applications in cancer bioenergetics.",Excluded,0.10329075
542,"Metallothionein induction in human CNS in vitro: neuroprotection from ionizing radiation. PURPOSE: There have been extensive studies on the regulation of metallothionein (MT) synthesis, and its biological role in liver and kidney. Although there are few reports on brain MT, there is a growing interest in the role of MT in brain. There have been no publications to date on MT synthesis in the human central nervous system (CNS) following exposure to ionizing radiation. In the present study, primary human CNS cultures were used to examine the effect of ionizing radiation on MT mRNA and protein synthesis. In the same cultures, the neuroprotective effects of zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd)-induced MT synthesis from high-dose radiation were also examined.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary, serum-free, human CNS cultures were exposed to 30 or 60 Gy gamma-rays. The total MT protein was then measured by a Cd-heme assay, and mRNA for MT-II and MT-III was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cytotoxicity was measured by LDH release and apoptotic cell death by DNA fragmentation analysis. Sublethal neuroglial injury was assessed morphologically using specific astrocytic (glial fibrillary acidic protein--GFAP) and neuronal (microtubule-associated protein 2--MAP2) immunohistochemical markers.RESULTS: The total MT protein content was increased 12h after exposure to 30Gy. The increase in MT content in response to 60Gy was not statistically significant. MT-II mRNA levels increased at 3 and 6h after exposure to 30Gy gamma-rays, with a maximum expression at 12-24 h. MT-III mRNA was not significantly affected. Exposure to 60 Gy, but not 30 Gy, caused a marked increase in LDH release. Cells exposed to 30 Gy or less showed some apoptotic cell death by DNA fragmentation analysis, while exposure to 60 Gy resulted in a DNA smear confirmed by LDH assays. Preinduction of MT by 5 microM Cd or 100 microM Zn resulted in a significant reduction in radiation-induced LDH release. Morphological evaluations revealed that Cd or Zn preincubation led to relative preservation of MAP2 staining and GFAP.CONCLUSION: Both MT protein and MT-II mRNA can be induced in human CNS cells by ionizing radiation. Furthermore, induction of MT synthesis with Zn and Cd can protect human CNS cells from radiation-induced cytocidal and sublethal injuries. Both findings have implications in the development of strategies to protect human CNS tissue from damage during radiotherapy.",Included,0.924005

Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a practical technique which is sensitive to veins, especially tiny veins. Our purpose of this study was to evaluate the visualization of the venous network of brainstem by using SWI at 3.0 T. Method(s): The occurrence rate of each superficial veins of brainstem was evaluated by using SWI on a 3 T MR imaging system in 60 volunteers. The diameter of the lateral mesencephalic vein and peduncular vein were measured by SWI using the reconstructed mIP images in the sagittal view. And the outflow of the veins of brainstem were studied and described according to the reconstructed images. Result(s): The median anterior pontomesencephalic vein, median anterior medullary vein, peduncular vein, right vein of the pontomesencephalic sulcus, and right lateral anterior pontomesencephalic vein were detected in all the subjects (100 %). The outer diameter of peduncular vein was 1.38 +/- 0.26 mm (range 0.8-1.8 mm). The lateral mesencephalic vein was found in 75 % of the subjects and the mean outer diameter was 0.81 +/- 0.2 mm (range 0.5-1.2 mm). The inner veins of mesencephalon were found by using SWI.

544,"Beneficial outcomes after PCV plus RT in oligodendroglial tumors are associated with detection or risk of an IDH mutation. BACKGROUND: Oligodendroglial tumors harbor IDH mutations and risk of this type of cancer is associated with a germ-line polymorphism at 8q. In addition, when these tumors harbor a co-deletion of 1p19q, they can be highly chemo-sensitive. Indeed, patients with anaplastic tumors (i.e., AO/AOA) with 1p19q co-deletion lived nearly twice as long after chemotherapy and radiation (CRT; 14-16 years) as radiotherapy alone (RT; 7-9 years) in two large randomized trials. In RTOG 9402, some patients with non-co-deleted AO/ AOA also lived longer after CRT: for these participants, the survival curves separated after the median had been reached, and significantly more lived 10 years or longer after CRT than RT (25% vs. 10%). Since co-deletion status did not identify all patients benefiting from CRT, we asked whether other molecular hallmarks of AO/AOA - IDH or G-allele status - might be more inclusive markers of benefit from CRT. METHOD(S): We used tissues and data from RTOG 9402 to explore this hypothesis. RESULT(S): IDH status was evaluable in 210 of 291 participants: 156 (74%) had a mutation of IDH1/2. The Gallele of rs55705857 was evaluable in 245 of 291 participants: 76 (31%) carried the risk-allele in their germ-line. Presence of either an IDH mutation or the G risk-allele was associated with significantly longer progression-free survival after CRT, and an IDH mutation with much longer overall survival [9.4 vs. 5.7 years, hazard ratio (HR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.40, 0.86), P = 0.006]. For cases in which IDH was intact, CRT did not prolong median survival time [1.3 vs. 1.8 years, HR 1.14, CI (0.63, 2.04), P = 0.67] or 10-year survival rates (CRT 6% vs. RT 4%). As expected, patients with mutated, co-deleted AO/AOA lived longer after CRT than RT (14.7 vs. 6.8 years, HR 0.49, CI (0.28, 0.85), P = 0.01], but so too did those with mutated, non-co-deleted AO/AOA [5.5 vs. 3.3 years, HR 0.56, CI (0.32, 0.99), P < 0.05]. Among the latter, ATRX positive and negative cases had longer overall survival after CRT than RT, but these differences were not significant. CONCLUSION(S): In AO/AOA cases in RTOG9402, the presence or risk of an IDH mutation was associated with 'benefit' from CRT. Wild-type IDH was associated with poor overall and long-term survival, and absence of benefit from CRT. IDH mutation status identified more patients who benefited from CRT than did 1p/19q co-deletion status, but patients with co-deleted AO/AOA lived much longer.",Excluded,0.7302505

Biological effects of man-made electromagnetic fields (EMFs) have been studied so far by experimental approaches exposing animals and cell cultures to EMFs. However, the evidence for cell toxicity induced by static magnetic field (SMF) is still uncertain. We investigated the effects produced by the exposure of human SH-SY5Y neuronal-like cells to a uniform magnetic field at intensities of 2.2 mT, which is less than the recommended public exposure limits set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). A decrease of membrane mitochondrial potential up to 30% was measured after 24 h of exposure to SMF in SH-SY5Y cells, and this effect was associated with reactive oxygen species production increase. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed that exposure to a static magnetic intensity around 2.2 mT changed the secondary structure of cellular proteins and lipid components. The vibration bands relative to the methylene group increased significantly after 4 h of exposure, whereas further exposure up to 24 h produced evident shifts of amide I and II modes and a relative increase in beta-sheet contents with respect to alpha-helix components.

548,"Timed hypocaloric feeding and melatonin synchronize the suprachiasmatic clockwork in rats, but with opposite timing of behavioral output. Temporal organization of the molecular clockwork and behavioral output were investigated in nocturnal rats housed in constant darkness and synchronized to nonphotic cues (daily normocaloric or hypocaloric feeding and melatonin infusion) or light (light-dark cycle and daily 1-h light exposure). Clock gene (Per1, Per2 and Bmal1) and clock-controlled gene (Vasopressin) expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei was assessed over 24 h. Light and exogenous melatonin synchronized the molecular clock, signaling, respectively, 'daytime' and 'nighttime', without affecting temporal organization of behavioral output (rest/activity rhythm). By contrast, synchronization to hypocaloric feeding led to a striking temporal change between gene expression in the suprachiasmatic clock and waveform of locomotor activity rhythm, rats then becoming active during the subjective day (diurnal-like temporal organization). When the time of feeding coincided with activity offset, normocaloric feeding also synchronized the locomotor activity rhythm with no apparent switch in temporal organization. Peak of Per2 expression in the piriform cortex occurred between the beginning and the middle of the activity/feeding period, depending on the synchronizer. These data demonstrate that even though the suprachiasmatic clockwork can be synchronized to nonphotic cues, hypocaloric feeding likely acts downstream from clock gene oscillations in the suprachiasmatic nuclei to yield a stable yet opposite organization of the rest/activity cycle.",Excluded,0.10402343

550,"[OA109] Validation of a radio-guided surgery technique based on beta-radiation: Test on ex-vivo specimens. Purpose: A very promising technique for radio-guided surgery (RGS) based on beta-radiation is being developed. The lower background, with respect to the established approach with high penetrant gamma radiation, can allow for a large diffusion of such a technique and extending the RGS to cases with a large uptake of surrounding healthy organs, such as abdominal and brain neoplastic disease or tumor of infancy. Method(s): To validate the beta-RGS feasibility study, tests on ex-vivo specimens of brain meningioma and gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have been performed. These clinical cases were selected between the tumors known to express receptors to a beta-emitting radio-tracer already in use in the clinical routine: <sup>90</sup>Y-labelled DOTATOC. Voluntary patients were enrolled according to the standard uptake value (SUV) and the expected tumor-to-non-tumor ratios (TNR) estimated from PET/CT images after administration of 68 Ga-DOTATOC. All of them gave written informed consent to participate in the clinical trial, already approved by the Ethics Committee. After administration of a low activity (about 2.5 mCi) of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC, the extracted ex-vivo specimens and the healthy tissue around the lesions were examined to assess the correlation between the counting rates measured by the developed beta-detecting probe and the expected 90Y activity. Result(s): All the neoplastic samples were correctly identified. A dependence of the counting rate both on the volume V and on the total activity of the sample were observed. Even injecting as low as 1.4 MBq/kg of radio-tracer, tumor remnants of 0.1 ml would be detectable in few seconds. Conclusion(s): The results of the clinical tests showed the validity of the underlying assumptions and strengthening the feasibility studies already published. Small radiopharmaceutical activity is required to detect a tumor remnant as expected due to the low background rates. The negligible medical staff exposure was also confirmed.

AIMS: To evaluate the survival rates, prognostic factors and adverse events in patients with pituitary adenomas following fractionated stereotactic-guided radiotherapy (FSRT). MATERIAL AND METHODS. Fifty-six patients with pituitary adenomas were treated with FSRT; 23 patients (41.1%) had primary adenomas, 33 had recurrent disease; 24 (42.9%) with non-functional and 32 (57.1%) with functional adenomas. Using conventional fractionation, median total dose administered was 54 Gy (range: 24-56 Gy). RESULTS. The median follow-up was 51 months (range: 9-102) and, at the time of analysis, 49 patients were alive and disease-free, 1 patient was alive with reduced visual acuity and biochemical indications of recurrence, 2 patients had died from the disease and 1 patient had died from unrelated causes. Overall survival was 94% (50/53) and overall local tumour control was 92% (49/53). Univariate analysis indicated hormonal secretion (ACTH) and previous radiotherapy as being statistically significant. Fourteen patients (25%) had minor side-effects during treatment and 3 patients (5.4%) had late-onset events; 2 with optical neuropathy (both patients had other relevant co-existing diseases) and 1 patient had brain necrosis (re-irradiation).

Recently, several phase II studies have shown some efficacy of the association of WBRT and temozolomide (TMZ), an oral alkylating agent already known as a radiosensitizer, with improved brain control rate (44 to 96%). Patients with breast cancer were underrepresented and none of these trials have studied this combined treatment issue in this specific population. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of WBRT combined with temozolomide in the treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective randomized multicenter phase II study was developed, using a modified two-stage Fleming design. Patients with newly diagnosed intraparenchymal brain metastases from breast cancer, not suitable for surgery nor radiosurgery, were included. All patients received conformational WBRT (3 Gy x 10 to 30 Gy). They were randomized to WBRT plus concomitant TMZ administered 75 mg/m2/day during radiation period versus WBRT alone. The primary endpoint was radiologic objective response at six weeks after the end of treatment, defined as a partial or complete response on systematic brain MRI (WHO modified criteria). We also evaluated neurologic symptoms, tolerance, safety, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as secondary endpoints. A longer clinical-brain MRI follow-up was planned, each three months during a two-year period. All of the patients gave their written informed consent to be part of the study, which was approved by the local committee. Result(s): One hundred patients were enrolled between February 2008 and December 2010 (50 in the WBRT + TMZ arm, 50 in the WBRT arm). The median age was 55 [29 -79]. Eighty (80) patients had brain metastases as single secondary localization. About one third of patients had a triple negative breast cancer subtype (38,3% in the association arm and 35,71% in the WBRT alone arm). There were 26,7% and 14,6% of HER2 positive subtype respectively. The median follow-up was 30 months [range 6-60]. At six months from brain metastases diagnosis (three months after the end of the treatment), objective response rate seems better in the WBRT + TMZ arm: 52% versus 40% in the arm WBRT alone but was not statistically significant (p = 0,54). No complete response was observed. In the WBRT + TMZ group, median PFS and OS at six-months were respectively 55,6% [range 46-7 - 66,0] and 67,7% [range 59,1 - 77,6]. No improvement in neurologic symptoms was noticed. In multivariate analysis, initial TNM status was significantly correlated with PFS and OS. The concurrent use of TMZ with WBRT was well-tolerated. The most frequent upper grade II acute toxicity was reversible leucopenia in the association arm. Conclusion(s): The addition of temozolomide to WBRT in patients with brain metastases from breast cancer did not improve local control or survival at six months follow-up.",Excluded,0.11123722
554,"Study on the Appropriate Timing of Postoperative Adaptive Radiotherapy for High-Grade Glioma. Purpose: To investigate the appropriate timing of adaptive radiotherapy (ART) for high-grade glioma.Methods: Ten patients with high-grade gliomas were selected and underwent CT/MRI (CT<sub>1</sub>/MRI<sub>1</sub>, CT<sub>2</sub>/MRI<sub>2</sub>, CT<sub>3</sub>/MRI<sub>3</sub>, and CT<sub>4</sub>/MRI<sub>4</sub>) scans before RT and during 10-, 20- and 30-fraction RT, and the corresponding RT plans (plan<sub>1</sub>, plan<sub>2</sub>, plan<sub>3</sub> and plan<sub>4</sub>) were made. The dose of the initial plan (plan<sub>1</sub>) was projected to CT2 and CT3 using the image registration technique to obtain the projection plans (plan<sub>1-2</sub> and plan<sub>1-3</sub>) and by superimposing the doses to obtain the ART plans (plan<sub>10+20</sub> and plan<sub>20+10</sub>), respectively. The dosimetric differences in the target volume and organs at risk (OARs) were compared between the projection and adaptive plans. The tumor control probability (TCP) for the planning target volume (PTV) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the OARs were compared between the two adaptive plans.Results: Compared with the projection plan, the D<sub>2</sub> to the PTV of ART decreased, the conformity index (CI) to the PTV increased, and the D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>mean</sub> to the brainstem, optic chiasm and pituitary, as well as the V<sub>20</sub>, V<sub>30</sub>, V<sub>40</sub> and V<sub>50</sub> to the normal brain decreased. The D<sub>2</sub> to the pituitary and optic chiasm as well as the V<sub>20</sub>, V<sub>30</sub>, V<sub>40</sub> and V<sub>50</sub> to the normal brain in plan<sub>10+20</sub> were lower than those in plan<sub>20+10</sub>, while the CI to the PTV was higher than that in plan<sub>20+10</sub>. The TCP of the PTV in plan<sub>10+20</sub> was higher than that in plan<sub>20+10</sub>.Conclusion: ART can improve the precision of target volume irradiation and reduce the irradiation dose to the OARs in high-grade glioma. The time point after 10 fractions of RT is appropriate for ART.",Excluded,0.10323106
555,"900-MHz microwave radiation enhances gamma-ray adverse effects on SHG44 cells. Mobile phones are widely used globally. However, the biological effects due to exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) produced by mobile phones are largely unknown. Environmental and occupational exposure of humans to gamma-rays is a biologically relevant phenomenon. Consequently studies were undertaken to examine the interactions between gamma-rays and EMF on human health. In this study, exposure to 900-MHz EMF expanded gamma-ray damage to SHG44 cells. Preexposure EMF enhanced the decrease in cell proliferation induced by gamma-ray irradiation and the rate of apoptosis. The combination of EMF and gamma-ray exposure resulted in a synergistic effect by triggering stress response, which increased reactive oxygen species, but the expression of hsp70 at both mRNA and protein levels remained unaltered. Data indicate that the adverse effects of gamma-rays on cellular functions are strengthened by EMF.",Excluded,0.7098031
556,"Toxicity of high-activity 111In-Octreotide therapy in patients with disseminated neuroendocrine tumours. Disseminated neuroendocrine tumours are difficult to treat and are generally not responsive to radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Nuclear medicine techniques using a radiolabelled somatostatin analogue, 111In-Octreotide, have been used for the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumours. It has been suggested that high activities of such an agent may have a therapeutic effect. The aims of this study were to assess toxicity and to determine if there had been evidence of efficacy. Eight patients with known disseminated neuroendocrine tumours were enrolled in the study; six had carcinoid tumours, one had a medullary cell carcinoma of the thyroid and one patient had a malignant gastrinoma. Between 1.3 and 4.6 GBq of 111In-Octreotide were administered to each patient for up to five administrations over 12 months. A total of 23 administrations were given. Tests of vital signs, renal, liver and endocrine function as well as haematological markers were taken before and after treatment. The treatment was well tolerated with only one patient suffering from a sensation of flushing during the infusion but no changes in vital sings. There was a transient (up to 48 h) drop in circulating lymphocytes in four patients and platelets in two patients; no supportive therapy was needed. One patient with severe renal impairment had a slight reduction in glomerular filtration rate. We conclude that high-activity 111In-Octreotide is well tolerated with low toxicity and can be considered for use in patients with disseminated neuroendocrine tumours.

558,Biological properties of a tumour cell line (NB1-G) derived from human neuroblastoma. The properties of a new tumour cell line (NB1-G) derived from human neuroblastoma by xenografting in nude rats followed by adaptation to tissue culture are described. Studies using a panel of monoclonal antibodies demonstrate the neuro-ectodermal nature of the cells and support the diagnosis of the primary tumour as neuroblastoma. Cytogenetic studies have revealed a human karyotype with several chromosomal abnormalities. Genetic analysis by in situ DNA hybridization has demonstrated the presence of multiple copies of the N-myc gene. Approximately 20-30 fold amplification of the gene is observed on Southern blot analysis. The cell line has been adapted to growth as multicellular tumour spheroids as well as monolayer culture. Radiobiological studies on spheroids show the cells to be radiosensitive with low capacity for sub-lethal damage accumulation and repair. The cell line should be useful for fundamental studies of human neuroblastoma as well as experimental therapy in vitro.,Excluded,0.10211444
559,"Differential biodistribution of native and 2 kGy 60Co irradiated crotoxin in tissues of CBA/J mice. Crotalus durissus envenomation is treated using antivenins produced in horses. During production, animals have problems, sometimes followed by death, due to the high toxicity of the main toxin, crotoxin. Several methods tested to detoxify this toxin often resulted in decreased immunogenicity. Gamma irradiation has proved to be a successful method for crotoxin detoxification without loss of immunogenicity. We have studied the biodistribution of 2 kGy 60Co irradiated crotoxin (iCTX) in mouse tissues. We used both 125I-labeled iCTX or its detection by a specific immunohistochemistry assay (IHA). Both approaches showed similar early excretion of toxins by the kidneys. Higher iCTX uptake was seen in spleen and liver, which are rich in immune responder cells. In contrast to previous reports concerning native crotoxin (nCTX), we failed to detect iCTX in the neuromuscular junction, but both toxins were found on the kidney tubular cell surface, with rapid excretion that was more intense for iCTX. Kupffer cells and splenocyte macrophages presented IHA staining, as shown by the increased uptake of 125I toxin by these organs. No staining was observed in the brain, lung or heart, which also showed very low 125I counts. Allied to reduced toxicity, irradiation induced early endocytosis of crotoxin by phagocytic cells, improving antigen processing.",Excluded,0.9231148
560,"Value of three-dimensional computed tomography in craniomaxillofacial surgery. Three-dimensional (3-D) computed tomographic (CT) scans of 72 adult patients were evaluated by two observers in a blinded fashion by comparing the 3-D images with the two-dimensional (axial and coronal) CT scans. With 3-D CT, the observers found improved visualization of facial anatomy in certain patients (i.e., asymmetries of the whole face and skull large defects of the midface and skull vault, and fractures with major dislocation). In these defects, the information can be assimilated more rapidly. The documentation of effects of cranial surgery on craniofacial growth and resorption after reconstruction with autologous material can also be evaluated more accurately. Because higher levels of radiation are used, 3-D CT protocols are less indicated in patients with minor dislocation of fractures, tumors, and inflammations. Three-dimensional CT images in these patients are of little help and can mislead the surgeon. Further improvements in hardware and software will allow more accurate surgical planning by performing interactive surgery or by producing precise models.",Excluded,0.10410417

Some survivors develop an irreversible decrease in neurological function, and the mortality rate is as high as 70% in severe cases. PBMT is an alternative to treat secondary injuries due to TBI. <b>Methods:</b> This multidisciplinary clinical study was carried out on 10 chronic adult patients with severe TBI, who were treated with PBMT with an optical device containing 13 sets of 4 light emitting diodes, and underwent hemodynamic transcranial Doppler and neuropsychological evaluation at three different times: pre-PBMT, post-PBMT (after a week), and late-PBMT, which occurred 3 months after the last session. The patients received PBMTs three times a week, for 6 weeks. PBMTs were performed for 18 sessions for 6 weeks and 30 min per session. <b>Results:</b> The results found an alteration in the cerebral blood flow (CBF) as well as a consequent increase of the cerebral oxygenation that helped to improve the cerebral function. <b>Conclusions:</b> The PBMT contributed to increased CBF, evidenced mainly by the increased left peak systolic velocity, which consequently increased the hemodynamic response after the PBMT and impacts on the peripheral cerebral perfusion contributing to improved cerebral function.",Excluded,0.107105225
564,"Clinical trial of blood-brain barrier disruption by pulsed ultrasound. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the delivery of systemically administered drugs to the brain. Methods to circumvent the BBB have been developed, but none are used in standard clinical practice. The lack of adoption of existing methods is due to procedural invasiveness, serious adverse effects, and the complications associated with performing such techniques coincident with repeated drug administration, which is customary in chemotherapeutic protocols. Pulsed ultrasound, a method for disrupting the BBB, was shown to effectively increase drug concentrations and to slow tumor growth in preclinical studies. We now report the interim results of an ultrasound dose-escalating phase 1/2a clinical trial using an implantable ultrasound device system, SonoCloud, before treatment with carboplatin in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM).

BACKGROUND: Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is considered as the standard of care for breast cancer patients (pts) with CNS metastasis. The role of chemotherapy in these patients is still not clearly defined. Capecitabine (Xelodaw) alone has shown some efficacy, and the use of capecitabine concurrent with WBRT has been suggested as a radiosensitizer. This trial was design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of capecitabine administered concurrently with WBRT, compared to WBRT. METHOD(S): In this multicenter, national, phase II study, 130 pts were planned to be randomized in two arms: Arm A: WBRT (3000 cGy in 10 single daily fractions) followed by standard of care (capecitabine and 5-FU analogues not allowed); Arm B: WBRT and concurrent capecitabine (825 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/twice daily X 14days) followed by capecitabine (1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/ twice daily, days 1-14 every 21 days) as maintenance treatment. The main inclusion criteria were: age over 18, ECOG performance status 0 - 2, histologically confirmed breast cancer, newly diagnosed CNS metastasis non eligible for surgery or radiosurgery, no previous treatment for CNS metastases, and no treatment with capecitabine at time of inclusion. The primary objective was the best objective partial or complete CNS response rate according to RECIST criteria after central review. Secondary criteria included overall survival and safety. RESULT(S): The study was terminated earlier due to a slow recruitment rate over a 1 yearperiod. The ITT population comprised 23 patients: 12 in Arm A and 11 in Arm B. The majority of the patients (78%) presented with invasive ductal carcinomas. Patients in Arm B were slightly more limited: 27% were fully active compared to 46% of the patients in Arm A. The objective CNS response rate was higher in arm B (36%) than in arm A (25%) but the median overall survival was higher in arm A (9.8 months - 95%CI[4.3-17.0]) than in arm B (4.6 months - 95%CI[2.3-8.9]). The most frequently reported AEs were headaches (6 pts in each arm ), asthenia (7 pts in arm A, 5 in arm B), nausea (4 pts in arm A, 5 in arm B), scalp radiation reactions (6 pts in arm A, 2 in arm B); vomiting (1 pt in arm A, 6 in arm B) and diarrheas (1 pt in arm A, 3 in arm B). Twelve patients (52%), six in each arm, experienced SAEs. The most frequent SAE was ""general physical health deterioration"" (three patients). Two SAEs were considered related to capecitabine: colitis and pulmonary embolism and led to permanent treatment discontinuation and one SAE in Arm B was considered related to WBRT: depressed level of consciousness. Capecitabine was generally well tolerated, nausea being the most frequent AE leading to dose reduction and three patients had to stop the treatment because of capecitabine-related AEs.

MIITOP is a French multicenter trial whose objective is to evaluate the antitumor activity of an association of 131I-MIBG and Topotecan in refractory or relapse neuroblastomas. Two infusions of 131I-MIBG with 5 days Topotecan are scheduled. 444MBq/Kg of 131I-MIBG (with a maximum of 111000 MBq due to the French radioprotection limitations) is injected at the first course. A Whole body dosimetry is assessed using a ceiling counter and the MIRD model. The second dose of 131IMIBG is calculated to give a total whole body dose of 4 Gy. Stem cells are injected one month after the first dose. Fifteen patients were included at the end of 2011. Results. Dosimetry : Thirteen patients of 15 had a whole body dose of 2 Gy or more after the first course (2.02Gy - 4.78Gy). The 2 patients with less than 2 Gy received less than 444MBq/kg. The total dose after the two courses was between 3.75 and 4.94Gy. There is an important fluctuation of the whole body dose/MBq between patients. Conversely we observe a good stability of this parameter for a same patient. Toxicity : 4 patients showed a grade 4 hematological toxicity during more than 30 days (1 neutropenia, 5 thrombopenia and 1 anemia). No correlation was observed between this toxicity and the doses whether activity dose or radiation dose.Two serious adverse events occurred : one staphylococcus epidermidis septicemia and one fracture of a metastatic femur. No other adverse events were observed. Conclusion : The use of 444MBq/kg at the first course and the adaptation of the activity for the second course based on the radiation dose estimated by a ceiling counter and the MIRD Model to obtain a total whole body dose of 4 Gy is easily feasible, reliable and safe through a strict methodology.",Excluded,0.10353658

The results for individual parameters and for an estimate of overall damage are given in a data display, which summarises the morphological profile of the organ after both types of radiation. Damage and recovery were seen for many of the parameters studied but there was no standard response pattern applicable for all parameters. In particular, the response of individual crypt cell types could not be predicted from knowledge of the change in crypt numbers. With regard to the holistic response of the gut, neutron irradiation appeared to have caused more damage and produced more early effects than the X-irradiation.

568,"Absolute quantification of cerebral blood flow with magnetic resonance, reproducibility of the method, and comparison with H2(15)O positron emission tomography. While H2(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) is still the gold standard in the quantitative assessment of cerebral perfusion (rCBF), its technical challenge, limited availability, and radiation exposure are disadvantages of the method. Recent work demonstrated the feasibility of magnetic resonance (MR) for quantitative cerebral perfusion imaging. There remain open questions, however, especially regarding reproducibility. The main purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of MR-derived flow values to those derived from H2(15)O PET. Positron emission tomography and MR perfusion imaging was performed in 20 healthy male volunteers, who were chronic smokers, on day 1 and day 3 of a 4-day hospitalization. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups, each with 10 subjects. One group was allowed to smoke as usual during the hospitalization, while the other group stopped smoking from day 2. Positron emission tomography and MR images were coregistered and rCBF was determined in two regions of interest, defined over gray matter (gm) and white matter (wm), yielding rCBF(PET)gm, rCBF(MR)gm, rCBF(PET)wm, and rCBF(MR)wm. Bland-Altman analysis was used to investigate reproducibility by assessing the difference rCBFday3 - rCBFday1 in eight continual-smoker volunteers. The analysis showed a good reproducibility for PET, but not for MR. Mean +/- SD of the difference rCBFday3 - rCBFday1 in gray matter was 6.35 +/- 21.06 and 0.49 +/- 5.27 mL x min(-1) x 100 g(-1) for MR and PET, respectively; the corresponding values in white matter were 2.60 +/- 15.64 and -1.14 +/- 4.16 mL x min(-1) x 100 g(-1). The Bland-Altman analysis was also used to assess MRI and PET agreement comparing rCBF measured on day 1. The analysis demonstrated a reasonably good agreement of MR and PET in white matter (rCBF(PET)wm - rCBF(MR)wm; -0.09 +/- 7.23 mL x min(-1) x 100 g(-1)), while in gray matter a reasonable agreement was only achieved after removing vascular artifacts in the MR perfusion maps (rCBF(PET)gm - rCBF(MR)gm; -11.73 +/- 14.52 mL x min(-1) x 100 g(-1)).

569,"Glioblastoma Treatment with Temozolomide and Bevacizumab and Overall Survival in a Rural Tertiary Healthcare Practice. Background. The efficacy of temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy for treating newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM), a primary brain tumor with short survival, was demonstrated in a clinical trial in 2005, and since then, the standard-of-care for newly diagnosed GBM has been maximal safe surgery followed by 60 Gray of radiation with concomitant and adjuvant TMZ (standard radiotherapy and TMZ). In 2009, clinical trials also reported on the efficacy of bevacizumab for treating recurrent GBM. We performed a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of treatment regimens on overall survival for patients with GBM at a rural tertiary healthcare practice. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 307 consecutive, newly diagnosed GBM patients at one institution between 1995 and 2012 and assessed treatment patterns. We also compared overall survival according to the treatment received. Results. Only 0.6% (1/163) of patients diagnosed before 2005 received standard radiotherapy and TMZ versus 36.1% (52/144) of patients diagnosed since 2005 (P < 0.0001). For patients who received standard radiotherapy and TMZ, the median overall survival was 17.0 months versus 7.0 months for patients who received 60 Gray of radiation but no chemotherapy (P = 0.0000078). The median overall survival was 15.4 months in the 19 patients treated with bevacizumab monotherapy at first GBM recurrence versus 6.8 months in the 32 patients with no treatment at first GBM recurrence (P = 0.00015), but patients who received bevacizumab were younger and more likely to have had a surgical resection and 60 Gray of radiation at diagnosis. Conclusions. TMZ and bevacizumab therapies were rapidly adopted in a rural tertiary healthcare setting, and patients who received these treatments had increased overall survival. However, advantageous prognostic factors in patients who received bevacizumab at recurrence may have influenced the extent of the increase in overall survival attributed to this treatment.

570,"CBCT-guided Winston Lutz test. Purpose/Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of the radiation isocenter of a linac when a Winston Lutz (WL) test is performed using the CBCT as a localization tool for the target. Material(s) and Method(s): A Varian 2100 CD linac equipped witha 120 MLC, aSi 500 EPID and OBI system (v 1.5). A phantom containing a central tungsten ball (5 mm diameter) mimicking a target is used. The phantom was CT scanned in a Siemens Somaton scanner (planning CT, pCT) and imported into the Eclipse TPS (v. 10.0). The tungsten ball was delineated and a no-coplanar plan (WL plan) was added with its isocenter located at the ball center. The WL plan consisted of 10 smallfields (6X) of 2x2 cm size collimated with the Millennium 120 MLC of the linac (G0T0,G140T315, G140T270, G180T0, G220T90, G220T45, G270T0, G270T45, G90T0 and G90T315,where G: gantry and T: table, scale: Varian IEC). The WL plan includes a CBCT field setup. The phantom was setup in the linac by aligning the ball center with the room lasers. After that, intended shifts within +/- 1 cm were applied alongside the three translational directions of the table, in order to simulate a setup error of the phantom. CBCT was acquired (Gantryrotation: 360degree, FOV: 45 cm, matrix: 512x512 and slice distance: 1 mm) and 3D/3D match was performed using the pCTas reference. The required couch movements to correct the actual position ofthe target were applied in a remote way. After that, the WL plan was delivered and an integrated MV image for each field was acquired using the EPID. EPID was positioned at 80 cm below the linac isocenter, giving a pixel size of 0.4 mm. The WL plan was irradiated twelve times during a year (118 shots/images). Each recorded MV image was analysed with ImageJ software in order to measure the distance (2D) between the ball center and the field center. Each 2D distance was decomposed into the three anatomical directions (Left/Right, Anterior/Posterior and Superior/Inferior). Result(s): The analysis of the 118 MV images collected reported the following differences (mean and 95% CI) between the ball center and the radiation center: 1) L/R : 0.6 mm [95% CI: 1.4 mm] 2) AP/PA : 0.5 mm [95% CI: 1.2 mm] 3) Sup/Inf: 0.7 mm [95% CI: 1.6 mm] Conclusion(s): The isocenter accuracy was within 2 mm on each direction, when the CBCT technique is used for target localization. The results found in this study included inaccuracies due to gantry and couch rotations, remote couch movements and potential misalignments between the linac and the OBI isocenters.

All the patients suffered a dynamic pain from parietal or temporal areas to the contralateral ones, crossing the midline, the entire sequence lasting 2-3 seconds. One patient noticed mild interictal tenderness at the stemming point. No triggers were identified. Pain quality was electric and intensity was graded as moderate. The frequency of the attacks varied from two per week to one every two months. The neurological examination, neuroimaging and laboratory tests were normal.

573,"Cross-sectional analysis of resource utilization among patients with neuroendocrine tumours. Background: Although there is high morbidity and mortality associated with neuroendocrine tumours (NET), there are limited data in the literature to quantify the economic impact in this patient population. The aim of this study was to understand resource use among advanced NET patients. Material(s) and Method(s): An online survey was administered to physicians in the US, UK, Germany, France, Brazil, and Italy to collect data on patients with advanced NET. The survey gathered data on the incidence and frequency of resource use (e.g. chemotherapy, somatostatin analogs [SSA], PRRT). Result(s): Of the 4,100 surveys administered, 197 physicians participated (4.8%), providing data for 394 NET patients. Among all patients, nonpancreatic GI tract was the most common primary site (45.4%), followed by pancreas (30.7%). Resource utilization was high across tumour types as shown in Table 1. The most common types of chemotherapy used were: 5-fluorouracil (16.2%), etoposide (15.5%), and cisplatin (14.8%). (Table Presented) Conclusion(s): Results confirm that advanced NET is associated with significant resource use, regardless of tumour site. In addition to SSAs, patients are treated with chemotherapy and radiation-based approaches and twice as many patients are treated with targeted therapies in the pNET group as compared to the GI/Lung NET population.",Excluded,0.109730534
574,"Phosphorylation of rod outer segment proteins modulates phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase and phospholipase A2 activities in photoreceptor membranes. The activities of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism--phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PE N-MTase)--were found to be differently affected by pre-incubation of rod outer segments (ROS) under protein phosphorylating or dephosphorylating conditions. Exposure to cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), under dark or light conditions, produced a significant increase in PE N-MTase activity, whereas PLA2 activity decreased. Under standard protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylating conditions in light, PE N-MTase activity was stimulated and PLA2 activity was not affected. When the assays were performed in the dark, both enzymatic activities were unaffected when compared to the corresponding controls. Incubation of ROS membranes in light in the presence of PKC activators phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) and dioctanoylglycerol (DOG) resulted in the same pattern of changes in enzyme activities as described for standard PKC phosphorylating condition. Pre-incubation of membranes with the PKC inhibitor H-7 reduced the stimulation of PDBu on PE N-MTase activity, and had no effect on PLA2 activity in ROS membranes incubated with the phorbol ester. Pre-treatment of isolated ROS with alkaline phosphatase resulted in decreased PE N-MTase activity and produced a significant stimulation of PLA2 activity under dark as well as under light conditions when compared to the corresponding controls. These findings suggest that ROS protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation modulates PE N-MTase and PLA2 activities in isolated ROS, and that these activities are independently and specifically modulated by particular kinases. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of ROS proteins has the opposite effect to that produced by protein phosphorylation on the enzymes studied.",Excluded,0.103900805

Electroporation-based treatments typically consist of the application of high-voltage dc pulses. As an undesired side effect, these dc pulses cause electrical stimulation of excitable tissues such as motor nerves. The present in vivo study explores the use of bursts of sinusoidal voltage in a frequency range from 50 kHz to 2 MHz, to induce irreversible electroporation (IRE) whilst avoiding neuromuscular stimulation. A series of 100 dc pulses or sinusoidal bursts, both with an individual duration of 100 micros, were delivered to rabbit liver through thin needles in a monopolar electrode configuration, and thoracic movements were recorded with an accelerometer. Tissue samples were harvested three hours after treatment and later post-processed to determine the dimensions of the IRE lesions. Thermal damage due to Joule heating was ruled out via computer simulations. Sinusoidal bursts with a frequency equal to or above 100 kHz did not cause thoracic movements and induced lesions equivalent to those obtained with conventional dc pulses when the applied voltage amplitude was sufficiently high. IRE efficacy dropped with increasing frequency. For 100 kHz bursts, it was estimated that the electric field threshold for IRE is about 1.4 kV cm<sup>-1</sup> whereas that of dc pulses is about 0.5 kV cm<sup>-1</sup>.",Excluded,0.103503406
576,"Coordinated action of the Fanconi anemia and ataxia telangiectasia pathways in response to oxidative damage. Fanconi anemia (FA) and ataxia telangiectasia (AT) share common traits such chromosomal instability and proneness to hematological cancers. Both AT and FA cell lines, and patients, are characterized by abnormally high levels of oxidative stress markers. The key FA protein FANCD2 is phosphorylated on Ser 222 by ATM after ionizing radiation (IR), thus allowing normal activation of the S-phase checkpoint, and ATM cells are known to be hypersensitive to oxidative damage. In this work we show that FANCD2 deficient cells have a defective S-phase checkpoint after Hydrogen Peroxide (H(2)O(2)) induced oxidative damage. ATM dependent phosphorylation of FANCD2 at the S222 residue is necessary for normal S-phase checkpoint activation after oxidative stress, while FANCD2 monoubiquitination at K561 is dispensable. We also show that FANCD2 is not required for base excision repair of 8-oxoG and other DNA lesions (abasic sites, uracils), while treatments that exclusively induce 8-oxoG, but not DNA double strand breaks, fail to activate FANCD2 monoubiquitination, thus indicating that the known accumulation of 8-oxoG in FA cells reflects an overproduction of ROS rather than defective processing of oxidized bases. We conclude that the handling of DNA damage after H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress requires the coordinated action of FANCD2 and ATM.",Excluded,0.13589498
577,"The effect of vertical and horizontal symmetry on memory for tactile patterns in late blind individuals. Visual stimuli that exhibit vertical symmetry are easier to remember than stimuli symmetric along other axes, an advantage that extends to the haptic modality as well. Critically, the vertical symmetry memory advantage has not been found in early blind individuals, despite their overall superior memory, as compared with sighted individuals, and the presence of an overall advantage for identifying symmetric over asymmetric patterns. The absence of the vertical axis memory advantage in the early blind may depend on their total lack of visual experience or on the effect of prolonged visual deprivation. To disentangle this issue, in this study, we measured the ability of late blind individuals to remember tactile spatial patterns that were either vertically or horizontally symmetric or asymmetric. Late blind participants showed better memory performance for symmetric patterns. An additional advantage for the vertical axis of symmetry over the horizontal one was reported, but only for patterns presented in the frontal plane. In the horizontal plane, no difference was observed between vertical and horizontal symmetric patterns, due to the latter being recalled particularly well. These results are discussed in terms of the influence of the spatial reference frame adopted during exploration. Overall, our data suggest that prior visual experience is sufficient to drive the vertical symmetry memory advantage, at least when an external reference frame based on geocentric cues (i.e., gravity) is adopted.",Excluded,0.10226394

The radioresistance of glioblastoma presumably results from the presence of hypoxic cells. In an attempt to overcome this problem, fast neutrons were compared in a controlled pilot study with conventional megavoltage X-rays (photons). Sixty-three patients entered the study between January, 1973 and July, 1976, 30 patients received neutron and 33 received X-ray therapy. The overall mean survival was 11.4 months for those who received photon and 10 months for those who received neutron therapy. Survival rates at 6 and 12 months were 72% and 36%, respectively for photon treated patients, and 77% and 30% for those treated with neutrons. Although neutron therapy did not improve overall survival, examination of the histologic material indicated a considerably greater antitumor effect after neutron therapy than after treatment with photons. In the neutron treated group, at postmortem examination no tumor or only minimal tumor was found in 10 of 12 patients and in one of 4 patients where tissue was obtained from a second craniotomy.

Cognitive toxicity induced by cranial radiation is one of the most important limitations of radiation therapy and has a significant impact on brain tumor survivors' quality of life. This review comprehends an up to date of recent studies including complete neuropsychological battery and/or advanced neuroimaging techniques. These studies identified critical anatomical and/or functional brain areas related to radiation-induced brain injury, thus improving clinical and radiological diagnosis. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive toxicity are complex and involve different cell lines and molecules. Although there is no currently therapeutic strategy that has a demonstrated efficacy, several studies including sparing of hippocampus or the use of memantine are quite promising. A better knowledge of the characteristics of cognitive toxicity induced by cranial radiation, will help us to identify patients who will benefit from treatment and also to examine new therapeutic targets in order to improve patients' quality of life.

587,"Type 5 phosphodiesterase regulates glioblastoma multiforme aggressiveness and clinical outcome. Expression of type 5 phosphodiesterase (PDE5), a cGMP-specific hydrolytic enzyme, is frequently altered in human cancer, but its specific role in tumorigenesis remains controversial. Herein, by analyzing a cohort of 69 patients affected by glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who underwent chemo- and radiotherapy after surgical resection of the tumor, we found that PDE5 was strongly expressed in cancer cells in about 50% of the patients. Retrospective analysis indicated that high PDE5 expression in GBM cells significantly correlated with longer overall survival of patients. Furthermore, silencing of endogenous PDE5 by short hairpin lentiviral transduction (sh-PDE5) in the T98G GBM cell line induced activation of an invasive phenotype. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of PDE5 activity strongly enhanced cell motility and invasiveness in T98G cells. This invasive phenotype was accompanied by increased secretion of metallo-proteinase 2 (MMP-2) and activation of protein kinase G (PKG). Moreover, PDE5 silencing markedly enhanced DNA damage repair and cell survival following irradiation. The enhanced radio-resistance of sh-PDE5 GBM cells was mediated by an increase of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) of cellular proteins and could be counteracted by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Conversely, PDE5 overexpression in PDE5-negative U87G cells significantly reduced MMP-2 secretion, inhibited their invasive potential and interfered with DNA damage repair and cell survival following irradiation. These studies identify PDE5 as a favorable prognostic marker for GBM, which negatively affects cell invasiveness and survival to ionizing radiation.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the added value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) for differentiating tumour progression from radiation necrosis.METHODS: Sixteen consecutive patients who underwent removal of a metastatic brain tumour that increased in size after stereotactic radiosurgery were retrospectively reviewed. The layering of the ADC was categorised into three patterns. ADC values were measured on each layer, and the maximum rCBV was measured. rCBV and the layering pattern of the ADC of radiation necrosis and tumour progression were compared.RESULTS: Nine cases of radiation necrosis and seven cases of tumour progression were pathologically confirmed. Radiation necrosis (88.9 % vs. 14.3 %) showed a three-layer pattern of ADC with a middle layer of minimum ADC more frequently. If rCBV larger than 2.6 was used to differentiate radiation necrosis and tumour progression, the sensitivity was 100 % but specificity was 56 %. If the lesions with the three-layer pattern of ADC with moderately increased rCBV (2.6-4.1) were excluded from tumour progression, the sensitivity and specificity increased to 100 %.CONCLUSIONS: The three-layer pattern of ADC shows high specificity in diagnosing radiation necrosis; therefore, combined analysis of the ADC pattern with rCBV may have added value in the correct differentiation of tumour progression from radiation necrosis.",Excluded,0.10281075

591,"Magnetic-resonance imaging for kinetic analysis of permeability changes during focused ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier opening and brain drug delivery. Focused ultrasound (FUS) with the presence of microbubbles has been shown to induce transient and local opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for the delivery of therapeutic molecules which normally cannot penetrate into the brain. The success of FUS brain-drug delivery relies on its integration with in-vivo imaging to monitor kinetic change of therapeutic molecules into the brain. In this study, we developed a dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) technique for kinetic analysis of delivered molecules during FUS-BBB opening. Three kinetic parameters (K<inf>trans</inf>, V<inf>e</inf>, K<inf>ep</inf>) were characterized dynamically to describe BBB-permeability at two FUS exposure conditions (0.4 or 0.8 MPa) over 24 h. K<inf>trans</inf>, defined as the influx volume transfer constant from plasma to EES, and V<inf>e</inf>, the EES volume fraction, were both found to be pressure-dependent. K<inf>trans</inf> and V<inf>e</inf> showed a peak increase of 0.0086-0.0131 min<sup>- 1</sup> (for 0.4-0.8 MPa pressure), and 0.0431-0.0692, respectively, immediately after FUS exposure. Both parameters subsequently decreased exponentially as a function of time, with estimated half-lives of decay of 2.89-5.3 and 2.2-4.93 h, respectively. The kinetics of K<inf>ep</inf>, defined as the efflux rate constant from the extracellular extravascular space (EES) to the plasma, were complementary to K <inf>trans</inf>, with an initial decrease from 0.2010 to 0.1901 min <sup>- 1</sup> followed by a significantly longer recovery time (half-life of 17.39-99.92 h). Our observations strongly supported the existence of imbalanced and mismatched kinetics of influx (K<inf>trans</inf>) and efflux (K <inf>ep</inf>) between the plasma and EES, indicating the existence of directional permeability during FUS-BBB opening. We further showed that kinetic change determined by DCE-MRI correlated well with the concentration of Evans Blue (EB)-albumin (coefficient of 0.74-0.89). These findings suggest that MRI kinetic monitoring may serve as an alternative method for in-vivo monitoring of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) change of therapeutic agents during drug delivery to the brain, and provide useful information for future optimization of FUS-BBB opening. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.104059406

By combining this with measurements of the mean free path of the excitation light, adaptive optics and vector-based modeling that includes phase modulation and scattering, we show that tissue-induced wavefront distortions are the main determinant of enlargement and distortion of the PSF2p at intermediate imaging depths. Furthermore, they generate surrounding lobes that contain more than half of the 2P excitation. These effects reduce the resolution of fine structures and contrast and they, together with scattering, limit 2P excitation.

Therapeutic irradiation of the brain is a common treatment modality for brain tumors, but can lead to impairment of cognitive function. Dendritic spines are sites of excitatory synaptic transmission and changes in spine structure and number are thought to represent a morphological correlate of altered brain functions associated with hippocampal dependent learning and memory. To gain some insight into the temporal and sub region specific cellular changes in the hippocampus following brain irradiation, we investigated the effects of 10 Gy cranial irradiation on dendritic spines in young adult mice. One week or 1 month post irradiation, changes in spine density and morphology in dentate gyrus (DG) granule and CA1 pyramidal neurons were quantified using Golgi staining. Our results showed that in the DG, there were significant reductions in spine density at both 1 week (11.9%) and 1 month (26.9%) after irradiation. In contrast, in the basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, irradiation resulted in a significant reduction (18.7%) in spine density only at 1 week post irradiation. Analysis of spine morphology showed that irradiation led to significant decreases in the proportion of mushroom spines at both time points in the DG as well as CA1 basal dendrites. The proportions of stubby spines were significantly increased in both the areas at 1 month post irradiation. Irradiation did not alter spine density in the CA1 apical dendrites, but there were significant changes in the proportion of thin and mushroom spines at both time points post irradiation.

Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in the phase adjustment of the circadian system during the subjective day in response to nonphotic stimuli. Two components of the circadian system, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (site of the circadian clock) and the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL), receive serotonergic projections from the median raphe nucleus and the dorsal raphe nucleus, respectively. Experiment 1, performed in golden hamsters housed in constant darkness, compared the effects of bilateral microinjections of the 5-HT1A/7 receptor agonist, 8-hydroxydipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.5 microgram in 0.2 microliter saline per side), into the IGL or the SCN during the mid-subjective day. Bilateral 8-OH-DPAT injections into either the SCN or the IGL led to significant phase advances of the circadian rhythm of wheel-running activity (p < .001). The phase advances following 8-OH-DPAT injections in the IGL were dose department (p < .001). Because a light pulse administered during the middle of the subjective day can attenuate the phase-resetting effect of a systemic injection of 8-OH-DPAT, Experiment 2 was designed to determine whether light could modulate 5-HT agonist activity at the level of the SCN and/or the IGL. Serotonergic receptor activation within the SCN, followed by a pulse of light (300 lux of white light lasting 30 min), still induced phase advances. In contrast, the effect of serotonergic stimulation within the IGL was blocked by a light pulse. These results indicate that the respective 5-HT projections to the SCN and IGL subserve different functions in the circadian responses to photic and nonphotic stimuli.",Excluded,0.10456341

Classification, prognosis and treatment of grade III glioma is now determined predominantly by molecular biomarkers, with 1p19q chromosomal co-deletion conferring a clear prognostic benefit and also being associated with better response to chemotherapy. The importance of this molecular biomarker is reflected in the updated WHO classification of central nervous system tumours that was published in 2016. Long term data from two large, randomised trials have shown that patients with 1p19q co-deleted anaplastic oligodendrogliomas derive significant survival benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy. More recent data from the NOA-04 study indicate that primary chemotherapy is not superior to primary radiotherapy in any molecular subgroup of anaplastic glioma and hence do not support the concept of 'delayed radiotherapy' in these patients. Despite the documented association of chemosensitivity with 1p19q co-deletion, a recent planned interim analysis of the CATNON study revealed that patients with anaplastic astrocytomas with inatct 1p19q chromosomal regions also derive significant benefit from the addition of adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy. It is not yet known whether the use of temozolomide concomitant with radiotherapy confers additional benefit; these hotly anticipated data are not expected to be available for at least two years. Hence, all patients with grade III gliomas appear to benefit from both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with maximum survival benefit being achieved by 'early' rather than 'delayed' treatment. A number of questions remain, including the optimum scheduling of these treatments and the optimum radiotherapy regime for the different molecular subtypes. The question of radiation dose and volume is particularly important for this group of patients in whom long term survival can be anticipated and the risks and potential impact of neurotoxicity are significant. Strategies to reduce the long term neurocognitive impact of radiotherapy in these patients should be developed and incorporated into future clinical trials.",Excluded,0.10420198

One hundred patients, aged 36-84 years (median 62 years) with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM), were treated previously with surgery, concurrent radiotherapy and temozolomide and postradiotherapy temozolomide followed by single-agent bevacizumab (BEV) at either first (60 patients) or second recurrence (40 patients). Patients were then treated following progression on BEV only with BEV and carboplatin (75 patients), cyclophosphamide (15 patients) or BCNU (ten patients; BEV+). Three hundred and sixteen treatment cycles (median: 2; range: 1-9) were administered of BEV+.

602,"Stereotactic robot-assisted MRI-guided laser thermal ablation of radiation necrosis in the posterior cranial fossa: technical note. Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat a variety of intracranial lesions. Utilization of robotic assistance with stereotactic procedures has gained attention due to potential for advantages over conventional techniques. The authors report the first case in which robot-assisted MRI-guided LITT was used to treat radiation necrosis in the posterior fossa, specifically within the cerebellar peduncle. The use of a stereotactic robot allowed the surgeon to perform LITT using a trajectory that would be extremely difficult with conventional arc-based techniques. A 60-year-old man presented with facial weakness and brainstem symptoms consistent with radiation necrosis. He had a history of anaplastic astrocytoma that was treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery 1 year prior to presentation, and he did well for 11 months until his symptoms recurred. The location and form of the lesion precluded excision but made the patient a suitable candidate for LITT. The location and configuration of the lesion required a trajectory for LITT that was too low for arc-based stereotactic navigation, and thus the ROSA robot (Medtech) was used. Using preoperative MRI acquisitions, the lesion in the posterior fossa was targeted. Bone fiducials were used to improve accuracy in registration, and the authors obtained an intraoperative CT image that was then fused with the MR image by the ROSA robot. They placed the laser applicator and then ablated the lesion under real-time MR thermometry. There were no complications, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. Postoperative 2-month MRI showed complete resolution of the lesion, and the patient had some improvement in symptoms.",Excluded,0.10321466

We have found that OMMT sp. act. can be increased, although to a lower extent, in kidney, spleen and brain in addition to liver. However, the sp. act. of OMMT in lung was reduced by irradiation. OMMT has been purified from the livers of irradiated rats by solubilization in high-salt-containing buffer, ammonium sulfate precipitation and a series of column chromatographic steps, including phenyl-Sepharose, heparin-agarose, double-stranded DNA-cellulose and FPLC. A 3000-fold enrichment of OMMT was achieved from the induced liver preparations.

604,"Analysis of factors affecting adjuvant radiation therapy timing in sinonasal malignancies. Introduction: Delays in initiation of adjuvant therapy are associated with poorer outcomes in patients who have undergone oncological resection for head and neck malignancy. There are many potential factors that can contribute to these delays, but unique to cancers that involve the base of skull is the potential to create communications that produce a leak in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). This study aims to evaluate variables that may produce delays in postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy for patients undergoing sinonasal malignancy surgery. Method(s): After approval from our institutional review board, a single-institution retrospective review of all patients undergoing endoscopic or open surgery for sinonasal malignancies from January 2007 to December 2017 were identified. Clinically relevant data, including basic demographics, tumor characteristics, procedure details, postoperative course and interested dates were tabulated. The covariates of surgical approach, tumor T stage (T1/2 vs. T3/4), reconstruction type, presence of an intraoperative CSF leak, and geographic location of radiation therapy were analyzed to see if they significantly impacted time to initiation of radiation therapy. Result(s): Of the 361 patients found on initial screening, 36 were identified to have a surgically resected primary sinonasal malignancy followed by radiation or chemoradiation therapy. Of these, 2 were excluded for incomplete data. The average number of days from surgery to initiation of radiation therapy was 50 (range: 21-86). No difference was found comparing endoscopic to open surgery (p = 0.80, CI: -12.6 to 9.9), tumor stage (p = 0.66, CI: -14.6 to 22.18), reconstruction method (p = 0.86), presence of an intraoperative CSF leak (p = 0.18, CI: -19.2 to 3.8), occurrence of an immediate postoperative complication (p = 0.36, CI: -19.7 to 7.3), or geographic location of radiation therapy (p = 0.10, CI: -26.8 to 2.6). Conclusion(s): This study suggests that adequate surgical resection, including base of skull resection with the potential of encountering a CSF leak, achieved by the appropriate approach and robust reconstruction for all tumor stages does not delay initiation of radiation therapy in sinonasal malignancies.",Excluded,0.12914062

Objectives To identify the frequency of severe symptoms as reported with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) by advanced cancer patients who presented to an outpatient radiation clinic. Methods A prospective study was conducted including patient demographics and the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) score at first visit. ESAS assessed pain, tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, loss of appetite, general well-being, dyspnea, and the additional symptom of constipation from a score of 0 to 10. Symptom scores from 7-10 were considered severe. Results 182 patients with 263 visits were included (median age 70.5 years, 58% male). The most common cancers were prostate (24.7%), lung (24.7%), and breast (13.7%). The median KPS score was 70.0 and ranged from 30-100. 84.4% of patients had bone metastases, 25.8% had lymph metasta-ses, 23.6% had lung metastases, and 21.4% had brain metastases.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate the diffusivity of different components of radiation-induced cerebral necrosis with the hypothesis that the diffusivity of the various components is elevated to different degrees.METHODS: Twenty-two patients (18 men, 4 women, aged 34-72 years) with radiation injury to the temporal lobes after radiation therapy (RT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma with diagnosis confirmed on serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were studied with coronal T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Using three diffusion directions for diffusion-weighted MRI, the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of the enhanced component, the cystic or liquefied component, and the edema component were measured.RESULTS: ADCs of all components of RT-induced cerebral necrosis (154 +/- 21.6 x 10(-5) mm2/s for contrast-enhanced component; 188 +/- 47.4 x 10(-5) mm2/s for cystic/liquefied component; 177 +/- 35.4 x 10(-5) mm2/s for edema component) were all significantly higher (P<0.00001) than ADC of the normal frontal lobe white matter (82 +/- 12.4 x 10(-5) mm2/s). The ADC of the enhanced component was significantly lower than that of the cystic/liquefied component (P=0.0096) and the edema component (P=0.003).

607,"Primary brain tumors in adults. Primary malignant brain tumors account for 2 percent of all cancers in U.S. adults. The most common malignant brain tumor is glioblastoma multiforme, and patients with this type of tumor have a poor prognosis. Previous exposure to high-dose ionizing radiation is the only proven environmental risk factor for a brain tumor. Primary brain tumors are classified based on their cellular origin and histologic appearance. Typical symptoms include persistent headache, seizures, nausea, vomiting, neurocognitive symptoms, and personality changes. A tumor can be identified using brain imaging, and the diagnosis is confirmed with histopathology. Any patient with chronic, persistent headache in association with protracted nausea, vomiting, seizures, change in headache pattern, neurologic symptoms, or positional worsening should be evaluated for a brain tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred initial imaging study. A comprehensive neurosurgical evaluation is necessary to obtain tissue for diagnosis and for possible resection of the tumor. Primary brain tumors rarely metastasize outside the central nervous system, and there is no standard staging method. Surgical resection of the tumor is the mainstay of therapy. Postoperative radiation and chemotherapy have improved survival in patients with high-grade brain tumors. Recent developments in targeted chemotherapy provide novel treatment options for patients with tumor recurrence. Primary care physicians play an important role in the perioperative and supportive treatment of patients with primary brain tumors, including palliative care and symptom control.

608,"Low-dose radiation hypersensitivity in human tumor cell lines: effects of cell-cell contact and nutritional deprivation. The hyper-radiosensitivity at low doses recently observed in vitro in a number of cell lines is thought to have important implications for improving tumor radiotherapy. However, cell-cell contact and the cellular environment influence cellular radiosensitivity at higher doses, and they may alter hyper-radiosensitivity in vivo. To confirm this supposition, we investigated the effects of cell density, multiplicity and nutritional deprivation on low-dose hypersensitivity in vitro. Cell survival in the low-dose range (3 cGy to 2 Gy) was studied in cells of two human glioma (BMG-1 and U-87) and two human oral squamous carcinoma (PECA-4451 and PECA-4197) lines using a conventional macrocolony assay. The effects of cell density, multiplicity and nutritional deprivation on hyper-radiosensitivity/induced radioresistance were studied in cells of the BMG-1 cell line, which showed prominent hypersensitivity and induced radioresistance. The induction of growth inhibition, cell cycle delay, micronuclei and apoptosis was also studied at the hyper-radiosensitivity-inducing low doses. Hyper-radiosensitivity/induced radioresistance was evident in the cells of all four cell lines to varying extents, with maximum sensitivity at 10-30 cGy, followed by an increase in survival up to 50 cGy-1 Gy. Both the glioma cell lines had more prominent hyper-radiosensitivity than the two squamous carcinoma cell lines. Low doses inducing maximum hyper-radiosensitivity did not cause significant growth inhibition, micronucleation or apoptosis in BMG-1 cells, but a transient G(1)/S-phase block was evident. Irradiating and incubating BMG-1 cells at high density for 0 or 4 h before plating, as well as irradiating cells as microcolonies, reduced hyper-radiosensitivity significantly, indicating the role of cell-cell contact-mediated processes. Liquid holding of BMG-1 cells in HBSS + 1% serum during and after irradiation for 4 h significantly reduced hyper-radiosensitivity, suggesting that hyper-radiosensitivity may be due partly to active damage fixation processes at low doses. Therefore, our findings suggest that the damage-induced signaling mechanisms influenced by (or mediated through) cell-cell contact or the cellular environment, as well as the lesion fixation processes, play an important role in hyper-radiosensitivity. Further studies are required to determine the exact nature of the damage that triggers these responses as well as for evaluating the potential of low-dose therapy.",Excluded,0.9169526

A palmitoyl derivative of ascorbic acid 2-glucoside, 6-palmitoyl ascorbic acid-2-glucoside (PAsAG), which possess good antioxidant properties, is examined for radioprotection in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models. PAsAG protected plasmid DNA from gamma-radiation induced damages under in vitro conditions. Presence of 1.6 mM PAsAG inhibited the disappearance of ccc (covalently closed circular) form of plasmid pBR322 with a dose modifying factor of 1.5. Comet assay studies on mouse spleen cells exposed to 6 Gy gamma-radiation (ex vivo) in presence and absence of PAsAG revealed that cellular DNA was effectively protected by this compound from radiation induced damages. Oral administration of 80 mg/kg body weight of PAsAG to mice 1 hour prior to 6 Gy whole body gamma-radiation exposure, efficiently protected cellular DNA in tissues such as spleen, bone marrow and blood, from radiation induced damages as indicated by alkaline comet assay. Oxidative stress in tissues such as liver and brain of mice, following whole body exposure to various doses of gamma-radiation (2-8 Gy), monitored as levels of GSH and peroxidation of lipids, were found considerably reduced when PAsAG was orally administered (80 mg/kg body weight) to the mice one hour prior to the radiation exposure. PAsAG administration improved the per cent survival of mice following exposure to 10 Gy whole body gamma-radiation.

611,"Neural circuits underlying circadian behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. Circadian clocks include control systems for organizing daily behavior. Such a system consists of a time-keeping mechanism (the clock or pacemaker), input pathways for entraining the clock, and output pathways for producing overt rhythms in behavior and physiology. In Drosophila melanogaster, as in mammals, neural circuits play vital roles in all three functional subdivisions of the circadian system. Regarding the pacemaker, multiple clock neurons, each with cell-autonomous pacemaker capability, are coupled to each other in a network. The outputs of different sets of clock neurons in this network combine to produce the normal bimodal pattern of locomotor activity observed in Drosophila. Regarding input, multiple sensory modalities (including light, temperature, and pheromones) use their own circuitry to entrain the clock. Regarding output, distinct circuits are likely involved for controlling the timing of eclosion and for generating the locomotor activity rhythms. This review summarizes work on all of these circadian circuits, and discusses the broader utility of studying the fly's circadian system. [References: 118]",Excluded,0.10404567
612,"Evaluation of Peritumoral Edema in the Delineation of Radiotherapy Clinical Target Volumes for Glioblastoma. Purpose: To evaluate the spatial relationship between peritumoral edema and recurrence pattern in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Methods and Materials: Forty-eight primary GBM patients received three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy that did not intentionally include peritumoral edema within the clinical target volume between July 2000 and June 2001. All 48 patients have subsequently recurred, and their original treatment planning parameters were used for this study. New theoretical radiation treatment plans were created for the same 48 patients, based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) target delineation guidelines that specify inclusion of peritumoral edema. Target volume and recurrent tumor coverage, as well as percent volume of normal brain irradiated, were assessed for both methods of target delineation using dose-volume histograms. Result(s): A comparison between the location of recurrent tumor and peritumoral edema volumes from all 48 cases failed to show correlation by linear regression modeling (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.0007; p = 0.3). For patients with edema >75 cm<sup>3</sup>, the percent volume of brain irradiated to 46 Gy was significantly greater in treatment plans that intentionally included peritumoral edema compared with those that did not (38% vs. 31%; p = 0.003). The pattern of failure was identical between the two sets of plans (40 central, 3 in-field, 3 marginal, and 2 distant recurrence). Conclusion(s): Clinical target volume delineation based on a 2-cm margin rather than on peritumoral edema did not seem to alter the central pattern of failure for patients with GBM. For patients with peritumoral edema >75 cm<sup>3</sup>, using a constant 2-cm margin resulted in a smaller median percent volume of brain being irradiated to 30 Gy, 46 Gy, and 50 Gy compared with corresponding theoretical RTOG plans that deliberately included peritumoral edema. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

613,"The role of tumor size in the radiosurgical management of patients with ambiguous brain metastases. OBJECTIVE: To identify a size cutoff below which it is safe to observe obscure brain lesions suspected of being metastases so that treatment of nonmetastases can be avoided. METHOD(S): Medical records from patients who underwent linear accelerator-based radiosurgery from August 1991 to October 2001 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were defined as brain metastasis tumor volume less than 5 cm<sup>3</sup> (diameter, ~2.1 cm) treated with a dose of 20 Gy or more. One hundred thirty-five patients had 153 evaluable brain metastases with follow-up imaging that met inclusion criteria. Median age was 54 years (range, 18-79 yr). Lesion primaries were non-small-cell lung (n = 39), melanoma (n = 44), renal (n = 37), breast (n = 18), colon (n = 3), sarcoma (n = 5), other (n = 5), and unknown primary (n = 2).

614,"Brain stereotactic radiosurgery planning using the single-isocenter dynamic-arc technique. Purpose/Objective(s): Brain stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment using a single isocenter for treating multiple metastases can save treatment time but poses a challenge to SRS planning using the dynamic-arc technique. The objective of this study is to develop a strategy for SRS planning using the single-isocenter dynamic-arc technique. We hypothesize that the single-isocenter dynamic-arc technique can produce satisfactory SRS plans for treating multiple targets and save treatment time. Materials/Methods: We have developed a planning strategy for singleisocenter dynamic-arc technique and used it clinically since February 2015. In this technique, the targets are first split into small batches so that all targets in a batch are within 5 cm of each other. The center of gravity of all targets in a batch is the isocenter, with which multiple treatment groups are associated. Each treatment group typically consists of 3 dynamic-arc beams to irradiate 1-3 targets. For each arc, the collimator angle is adjusted to minimize the ""island"" between targets that cannot be blocked with the multileaf collimators (MLCs). Each treatment group is normalized so that the maximal dose is 125% of the prescription dose. If the maximal dose to a target is less than 123%, an additional arc is used to boost the maximal dose of that target to 125%. To evaluate the plan quality we randomly selected 5 cases planned with this technique. There were totally 21 planning target volumes (PTVs), and 13 isocenters were used to treat all these targets. We replanned them using multiple isocenters, 1 isocenter for each target. The prescription for each target was 20 Gy with a maximal dose of 25 Gy, which was equivalent to 20 Gy to 80% isodose line. Plan quality indexes including PTV coverage, mean dose, V12Gy, conformity index (CI), and V50%/VPTV were compared. Result(s): Satisfactory PTV coverage (V100%Z95% and V95%Z100%) were achieved for all plans using either technique. Most PTVs have a maximal dose between 24.9 and 25.1 Gy, with 2 PTV between 24.5 and 24.9 Gy. The ratios of mean dose and CI between the single- and multiple-isocenter techniques were respectively 1.05+/-0.035 and 1.06+/-0.0, indicating similar plan quality globally and in the high dose area. The difference was more pronounced for the mid-to-low dose spillage with the ratios of V12Gy and V50%/VPTV being 1.12+/-0.055 and 1.14+/-0.045, respectively. Overall, the plan quality was slightly better for the multi-isocenter technique because the single-isocenter technique uses MLCs instead of jaws to block the radiation between targets and thus has a higher leakage dose. The treatment time was reduced by 30%-50% with the single-isocenter technique. Conclusion(s): The single-isocenter dynamic-arc technique can produce satisfactory SRS plans for treating multiple targets and can significantly reduce the treatment time. This time saving can be further improved using a larger allowable distance between targets. However, this tactic might worsen the rotational error to an unacceptable level.",Excluded,0.10334083

The optimal regimen remains unclear. We seek to investigate the clinical outcome and toxicities of SABR for central located stage I or isolated recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials/Methods: One hundred one patients with 101 central lesions, defined as being located within 2 cm of the bronchial tree, major vessels, esophagus, heart, tracheal, pericardium, mediastinal pleural and brachial plexus and vertebral body, but having no direct invasion, Stage I (n = 82), and isolated recurrent (n = 19) NSCLC, were treated with image-guided SABR to 50 Gy in four fractions or 70 Gy in ten fractions. Toxicity was scored according to the CTCAE V3.0. Result(s): With a median follow-up period of 27.5 months (range, 9.0-81.8 months), the local control rates were 98.0%, 96.1% at 2 years and 3 years respectively. The 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 71.0% and 57.5%, respectively. Although the most common side effect was radiation pneumonitis (RP), there was no G4 or G5 RP with current dose volume constraints (40 Gy <1 cc for the bronchial tree). A total of 18.8% had G2 RP and 2.0% had G3 RP. Dosimetric factors V5- V20, mean lung dose (MLD) of ipsilateral lung were associated with RP on univariate analysis. Three percent developed radiation brachial plexus neuropathy; the maximum brachial plexus doses of these patients were 38- 43 Gy in 4 fractions. One patient, with tumor invading hilum who was treated with SABR 70 Gy in 10 fx to PTV, died from hemoptysis one year later. Analysis showed that significant portions of pulmonary vessels received doses of 70 to 80 GY. Conclusion(s): SABR for central lung tumors resulted in high local control and acceptable toxicity when appropriate dose volume constraints were applied. Keeping brachial tree/pulmonary vessel dose 40 Gy <1 cc in 4 fractions appears safe in avoiding G4 or 5 RP. Maximal dose >38 Gy in 4 fractions to the brachial plexus was associated with neuropathy.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate local control rates after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in recurrent spinal metastasis after external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and new spinal metastatic lesions.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records and radiological data was performed on 54 retreatment and 131 initial SBRT patients. To compare various fractionation schedules, the biologically effective dose (BED) was applied. SBRT dose was calculated with linear-quadratic model and normalized to a 2-Gy equivalent dose (nBED, alpha/beta =2 Gy for spinal cord, alpha/beta =10 Gy for tumor). Doses to a point within the spinal cord that received the maximum dose (Pmax) were checked. Local control failure was defined as progression by imaging study. Overall survival, progression free survival, delivered radiation dose to tumor and spinal cord, and spinal cord Pmax nBED were compared in two groups.RESULTS: The mean delivered radiation doses to tumor margin during SBRT were 51.1 Gy2/10 (retreatment) and 50.7 Gy2/10 (initial treatment). Mean survival was 29.6 months (overall)/20.7 months (retreatment)/ 32.4 months (initial treatment). Mean progression free period was 23.9 months (overall)/18.0 months (retreatment)/ 26.0 months (initial treatment). Radiological control rates of retreatment and initial treatment group were 96%/95% at six months, 81%/89% at 12 months and 79%/90% at 24 months.

Of these three elements-pretest differential diagnosis, utility of MRI and CT, and risks of MR and CT-the risk component is perhaps the least well understood by most physicians. We provide a basic review of the intrinsic risks of MRI and CT, particularly radiation biology and radiation safety, as well as the risks pertaining to the use of contrast agents, to reduce provider confusion and anxiety and improve quality, safety, and efficiency of neuroimaging diagnosis in pregnant patients. We believe that a better understanding of the associated very low risks with mother and fetus will reassure the reader that CT remains the most appropriate tool for initial rapid diagnosis of acute neurological conditions in pregnancy and that in urgent situations CT should not be withheld or delayed due to exaggerated concern about radiation. Noncontrast MRI, while not without risk, is generally considered safe in pregnancy, as no evidence of fetal adverse effects has been demonstrated to date. Iodinated CT contrast agents are likely safer than gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents because of gadolinium accumulation in the amniotic fluid and fetal tissue, although no harmful effects of tissue gadolinium accumulation are known. In most but not all pregnant patients presenting with a new or worsening neurological abnormality, the risks intrinsic to the disease will outweigh the risks of imaging. In an individual patient, the pretest probability of serious treatable disease and acuity of presentation will usually suggest an optimal imaging strategy and choice of test. This optimal strategy will also depend on the immediate availability and level of sophistication of the scanners, software, technologists, and radiologists. As such, the standard of care for imaging in pregnancy requires direct consultation between the referring clinician and radiologist to determine the most appropriate strategy and brief documentation of the resulting consensus risk-benefit assessment.

The incidence of radiation necrosis has increased secondary to greater use of combined modality therapy for brain tumors and stereotactic radiosurgery. Given that its characteristics on standard imaging are no different that tumor recurrence, it is difficult to diagnose without use of more sophisticated imaging and nuclear medicine scans, although the accuracy of such scans is controversial. Historically, treatment had been limited to steroids, hyperbaric oxygen, anticoagulants, and surgical resection. A recent prospective randomized study has confirmed the efficacy of bevacizumab in treating radiation necrosis. Novel therapies include using focused interstitial laser thermal therapy.

Preclinical data have demonstrated that ionizing radiation acts synergistically with capecitabine. This report retrospectively assessed the use of capecitabine concurrently with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in patients with brain metastases from breast cancer. From January 2003 to March 2005, five breast cancer patients with brain metastases were referred for WBRT with concurrent capecitabine. Median age was 44 years (range: 38-53). The median dose of capecitabine was 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily for 14 days (day1-14). Treatment cycles were repeated every 21 days, concurrently with WBRT (30 Gy, 3 Gy per fraction, 5 days per week). Median survival after starting WBRT plus capecitabine was 6.5 months (range 1-34 months). One patient achieved a complete response. Two patients achieved partial response, including one with local control lasting until most recent follow-up. One patient had stable disease. The remaining patient was not assessable for response because of early death. Most commonly reported adverse events were nausea (n = 2) and headache (n = 2), always grade 1. Other toxicities were grade 3 hand/foot syndrome (n = 1), moderate anemia requiring transfusion and dose reduction of capecitabine (n = 1), and grade 1 mucositis (n = 1).

626,"Superoxide dismutase (sod-1) null mutants of Neurospora crassa: oxidative stress sensitivity, spontaneous mutation rate and response to mutagens. Enzymatic superoxide-dismutase activity is believed to be important in defense against the toxic effects of superoxide. Although superoxide dismutases are among the best studied proteins, numerous questions remain concerning the specific biological roles of the various superoxide-dismutase types. In part, this is because the proposed damaging effects of superoxide are manifold, ranging from inactivation of certain metabolic enzymes to DNA damage. Studies with superoxide-deficient mutants have proven valuable, but surprisingly few such studies have been reported. We have constructed and characterized Neurospora crassa mutants that are null for sod-1, the gene that encodes copper-zinc superoxide dismutase. Mutant strains are sensitive to paraquat and elevated oxygen concentrations, and they exhibit an increased spontaneous mutation rate. They appear to have near wild-type sensitive to near- and far-UV, heat shock and gamma-irradiation. Unlike the equivalent Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant and the sodA sodB double mutant of Escherichia coli, they do not exhibit aerobic auxotrophy. These results are discussed in the context of an attempt to identify consensus phenotypes among superoxide dismutase-deficient mutants. N. crassa sod-1 null mutant strains were also employed in genetic and subcellular fractionation studies.

630,"The role of the mammalian DNA end-processing enzyme polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 pathogenesis. DNA strand-breaks (SBs) with non-ligatable ends are generated by ionizing radiation, oxidative stress, various chemotherapeutic agents, and also as base excision repair (BER) intermediates. Several neurological diseases have already been identified as being due to a deficiency in DNA end-processing activities. Two common dirty ends, 3'-P and 5'-OH, are processed by mammalian polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), a bifunctional enzyme with 3'-phosphatase and 5'-kinase activities. We have made the unexpected observation that PNKP stably associates with Ataxin-3 (ATXN3), a polyglutamine repeat-containing protein mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD). This disease is one of the most common dominantly inherited ataxias worldwide; the defect in SCA3 is due to CAG repeat expansion (from the normal 14-41 to 55-82 repeats) in the ATXN3 coding region. However, how the expanded form gains its toxic function is still not clearly understood. Here we report that purified wild-type (WT) ATXN3 stimulates, and by contrast the mutant form specifically inhibits, PNKP's 3' phosphatase activity in vitro. ATXN3-deficient cells also show decreased PNKP activity. Furthermore, transgenic mice conditionally expressing the pathological form of human ATXN3 also showed decreased 3'-phosphatase activity of PNKP, mostly in the deep cerebellar nuclei, one of the most affected regions in MJD patients' brain. Finally, long amplicon quantitative PCR analysis of human MJD patients' brain samples showed a significant accumulation of DNA strand breaks. Our results thus indicate that the accumulation of DNA strand breaks due to functional deficiency of PNKP is etiologically linked to the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD.",Excluded,0.10294719
631,"Three-dimensional dosimetric evaluation of a conventional radiotherapy technique for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Background and purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate and delineate the deficiencies in conventional two-dimensional (2-D) radiotherapy planning of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treatment and to explore the means for improvement of the existing treatment technique aiming at enhancing local tumor control and reducing treatment complications. Methods and materials: Ten patients with NPC sparing the skull base and without intracranial extension or cranial nerve(s) palsy were chosen in the present study. Two sets of CT images for Phases I and II of the radiotherapy treatment were taken with patient immobilized in the flexed-head and the extended-head positions, respectively. Based on the CT images and endoscopic findings, the gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined. The clinical target volume (CTV) circumscribing the GTV was defined according to Ho's (Halnan, K.E. (ed.) Treatment of Cancer. London: Chapman and Hall, 1982. pp. 249-268) description of the organs at risk of tumor infiltration. The planning target volume (PTV) was defined by adding a margin to the CTV which catered for geometrical inaccuracies. The field borders and shields were set at standard distances from certain bony landmarks and were drawn on the simulator radiograph. Data on the beams and shield arrangements were then transferred to the planning computer via a digitizer. By applying 3-D volumetric dose calculation using a commercial three-dimensional (3D) treatment planning computer, the dose-volume-histograms (DVHs) of GTV, CTV, PTV and critical normal organs were generated for both phases of Ho's treatment technique. The same patients were re-planned using a modified Ho's technique which used 3-D beams-eye-view (BEV) in placing the shielding blocks and the same set of DVHs were generated and compared with those obtained from Ho's technique. Result(s): The median volumes of GTV, CTV and PTV covered by the 95% isodose in Ho's phase I treatment were around 60%. The dose coverage was unsatisfactory in the superior and inferior and the posterolateral regions. In phase II treatment, the median volume of GTV, CTV and PTV covered by the 95% isodose were 99, 96 and 72%, respectively. Even though the dose coverage of the PTV in both phases of treatment were unsatisfactory, radiotherapy with the original Ho's technique had consistently produced good local control for NPC. However, there is potential room for enhancing the local control further because after modifying Ho's technique by using 3-D BEV customization of the treatment portals, the median volume of the target covered by the 95% isodose was defined as V<inf>95</inf>. The V<inf>95</inf> of the PTV during the Phase II treatment was improved by 13%. The 90% of the volume of temporo-mandibular joints and parotid glands were both irradiated to 53 Gy and 43.6 Gy of the total prescribed dose of 66 Gy, respectively, in phase I and II treatments. With the addition of a hypothalamus-pituitary shield to Ho's technique, 50% of the volume of optic chiasma and temporal lobes received, respectively, 19.3 Gy and 4.5 Gy. However, small volume of the temporal lobes received a maximum dose (D<inf>max</inf>) of 62.8 Gy (95.2% of 66Gy). Most of the brainstem was shielded from the lateral portals but 5% of its volume received a dose ranging from 25.4 to 50.4Gy. The spinal cord (at C1/C2 level) received a D<inf>max</inf> of 40.8 Gy in phase I and of 4.8 Gy in phase II. After modifying Ho's technique by 3-D BEV customization of the treatment portals, the D<inf>max</inf> to the brainstem, the optic chiasma and the temporal lobes could be reduced by 8, 12 and 5%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Our study indicated that the dose-coverage of the PTV in Ho's radiotherapy technique for the early T-stage NPC was less than satisfactory in the superior and inferior and the posterolateral regions. However, in view of the excellent historical local tumor control with Ho's technique, we have to postulate that the present definition of CTV (and hence the PTV after adding margins to the CTV) lacks clinical significance and can be improved. It appears that the inclusion of the entire sphenoid sinus floor and both medial and lateral pterygoid muscles in the CTV is not necessary for maximal tumor control in the absence of clinical/radiological evidence of tumor infiltration of these organs. Ho's technique can be improved by using 3-D BEV to customize the treatment portals with multileaf collimators or blocks. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",Excluded,0.10352273

The purpose of our study was to determine the potential of echo planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in detecting subacute radiation induced injury to the normal brain.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients with brain metastases and three patients with lung cancer underwent cranial irradiation. These patients were subjected to 3D-EPSI and DTI at two time points (pre-radiation, and 1 month post-irradiation). Parametric maps of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) were generated and co-registered to post-contrast T1-weighted images. Normal appearing gray-matter and white-matter regions were compared between the two time points to assess sub-acute effects of radiation using independent sample t-tests.RESULTS: Significantly increased MD (P = .02), Cho/Cr (P = .02) and a trend towards a decrease in NAA/Cr (P = .06) was observed from the hippocampus. Significant decrease in FA (P = .02) from the centrum-semiovale and a significant increase in MD (P = .04) and Cho/Cr (P = .02) from genu of corpus-callosum was also observed.CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that 3D-EPSI and DTI may provide quantitative measures of radiation induced injury to the normal brain.",Excluded,0.91992223
634,"Hippocampal Sparing Whole Brain Radiotherapy and Integrated Simultaneous Boost vs Stereotactic Radiosurgery Boost: A Comparative Dosimetric Planning Study. BACKGROUND: Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery were frequently used to palliate patients with brain metastases. It remains controversial which modality or combination of therapy is superior especially in the setting of limited number of brain metastases. The availability of newer medical therapy that improves survival highlighted the importance of reducing long term radiation toxicity associated with WBRT. In this study, we aim to demonstrate the hippocampal sparing technique with whole brain and integrated simultaneous boost Materials and Methods: Planning data from 10 patients with 1-5 brain metastases treated with SRS were identified. Based on the contouring guideline from RTOG atlas, we identified and contoured the hippocampus with 5mm isocentric expansion to form the hippocampal avoidance structure. The plan was to deliver hippocampal sparing whole brain radiotherapy (HSWBRT) of 30 Gy in 10 fractions and simultaneous boost to metastatic lesions of 30 Gy in 10 fractions each.RESULTS: The PTV, hippocampus and hippocampal avoidance volumes ranges between 1.00 - 39.00 cc., 2.50 - 5.30 cc and 26.47 - 36.30 cc respectively. The mean hippocampus dose for the HSWBRT and HSWBRT and SIB plans was 8.06 Gy and 12.47 respectively. The max dose of optic nerve, optic chiasm and brainstem were kept below acceptable range of 37.5 Gy.CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this dosimetric study demonstrated the feasibility and safety of treating limited brain metastases with HSWBRT and SIB. It is possible to achieve the best of both worlds by combining HSWBRT and SIB to achieve maximal local intracranial control while maintaining as low a dose as possible to the hippocampus thereby preserving memory and quality of life.",Excluded,0.105594404

In the present study, the electrical activities of paired retinal ganglion cells, under full field light stimuli with a variety of chromatic configurations, were recorded from a small functioning piece of retina using multi-electrode array (MEA). Neurons that had increased firings at light-ON and -OFF transients and did not show color-opponent properties were investigated. Single neuronal analysis showed that firing rate of each individual neuron was dependent on the intensity of illumination. Multi-unit analyses revealed that adjacent neurons often fired in synchrony in response to light stimulation. However, in some cases, the strength of correlation between the paired neurons was higher when the retina was exposed to red or green light, and the correlation was attenuated when yellow or white light was given. This seems to suggest that the ensemble activity of non-color-opponent ganglion cells might partly participate in color-information processing, with the red- and green-pathway inputs influencing each other.

BACKGROUND. The incidence and pattern of brain metastases was analyzed among patients who achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS. Between 1990 and 2004, 211 patients were treated with neoadjuvant therapy before surgical resection for stage III NSCLC. The clinical course of 51 patients who demonstrated a pCR were reviewed. The neoadjuvant regimen consisted of either chemotherapy (29 patients) or chemoradiotherapy (22 patients). Histology was 45% adenocarcinoma, 41% squamous cell, and 14% large cell carcinoma. No patient received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). RESULTS. Overall survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 82%, 63%, and 42%, respectively. The most common site of initial recurrence was the brain. Twenty-two (43%) patients developed brain metastasis as the site of first failure, which represented 71% of all isolated recurrences. Ultimately, 28 (55%) patients developed brain metastases at some point during their clinical course. The 5-year estimates of brain metastasis-free survival for patients with squamous and nonsquamous cancers were 57% and 34%, respectively (P = .02). Median survival from the time of brain metastasis was 10 and 5 months for those with isolated and nonisolated recurrences, respectively. CONCLUSION.

The first step in the Visual Cycle, the series of reactions that regenerate the vertebrate visual pigment rhodopsin, is the reduction of all-trans retinal to all-trans retinol, a reaction that requires NADPH. We have used the fluorescence of all-trans retinol to study this reduction in living rod photoreceptors. After the bleaching of rhodopsin, fluorescence (excitation, 360 nm; emission, 457 or 540 nm) appears in frog and wild-type mouse rod outer segments reaching a maximum in 30-60 min at room temperature. With this excitation and emission, the mitochondrial-rich ellipsoid region of the cells shows strong fluorescence as well. Fluorescence measurements at different emission wavelengths establish that the outer segment and ellipsoid signals originate from all-trans retinol and reduced pyridine nucleotides, respectively. Using outer segment fluorescence as a measure of all-trans retinol formation, we find that in frog rod photoreceptors the NADPH necessary for the reduction of all-trans retinal can be supplied by both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial metabolic pathways. Inhibition of the reduction reaction, either by retinoic acid or through suppression of metabolic activity, reduced the formation of retinol.

Responses of BLA cells were more heterogeneous, but predominantly inhibitory, with a release from inhibition during the refractory phase of LC. Direct electrical stimulation of the LC with a single pulse also elicited an inhibitory response in BLA.

Purpose: Glioma is the most common type of primary brain tumor in adults, and it causes significant morbidity and mortality, especially in high-grade glioma (HGG) patients. The accurate prognostic prediction of HGG is vital and helpful for clinicians when developing therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we propose a machine learning-based survival prediction model by analyzing clinical and dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters, to improve the performance of the risk model in HGG patients. Method(s): Eight clinical variables and 39 DVH parameters were extracted for each patient, who received radiotherapy for HGG with active follow-up. Ninety-five patients were randomly divided into training and testing cohorts, and we employed random survival forest (RSF), support vector machine (SVM), and Cox proportional hazards (CPHs) models to predict survival. Calibration plots, concordance indexes, and decision curve analyses were used to evaluate the calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility of these three models. Result(s): The RSF model showed the best performance among the three models, with concordance indexes of 0.824 and 0.847 in the training and testing sets, respectively, followed by the SVM (0.792/0.823) and CPH (0.821/0.811) models. Specifically, in the RSF model, we identified age, gross tumor volume (GTV), grade, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and D99 as important variables associated with survival. The AUCs of the testing set were 92.4%, 87.7%, and 84.0% for 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival, respectively. According to this model, HGG patients can be divided into high- and low-risk groups. Conclusion(s): The machine learning-based RSF model integrating both clinical and DVH variables is an improved and useful tool for predicting the survival of HGG patients.

In the literature, no conversion coefficients are available for use in radiological protection of the embryo and foetus against external exposure to photons. This study used the Monte-Carlo code MCNPX to determine mean absorbed doses to the embryo and foetus when the mother is exposed to external photon fields. Monoenergetic photons ranging from 50 keV to 10 GeV were considered. The irradiation geometries included antero-posterior (AP), postero-anterior (PA), lateral (LAT), rotational (ROT), and isotropic (ISO). At each of these standard irradiation geometries, absorbed doses to the foetal brain and body were calculated for the embryo of 8 weeks and the foetus of 3, 6 or 9 months. Photon fluence-to-absorbed-dose conversion coefficients were estimated for the four prenatal ages.",Excluded,0.285296

648,"Characterization of structurally distinct, isoform-selective phosphoinositide 3'-kinase inhibitors in combination with radiation in the treatment of glioblastoma. The phosphoinositide 3'-kinase (PI3K)-mediated signaling pathway plays a key role in fundamental cellular functions important in normal cellular homeostasis and malignant transformation. Deregulated signaling through this pathway contributes to development of gliomas and their resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Targeting the PI3K signaling pathway has thus emerged as a promising approach to successful treatment of gliomas. We assessed the radiosensitizing potential of four small-molecule inhibitors that differ in their activities against specific isoforms of the PI3K 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). p110alpha inhibitors blocked phosphorylation of both protein kinase B/Akt and S6 in all cell lines examined, effectively decreased cellular proliferation, and produced additive cytotoxic effects in combination with radiation therapy. The p110beta inhibitor exhibited limited biochemical effects and failed to decrease cellular proliferation or viability as either a single agent or in combination with radiation or rapamycin. In vivo studies examining the effects of the p110alpha inhibitor in combination with radiation indicated a significant reduction in tumor growth rate induced by the combined treatment compared with each treatment modality alone. This translated into a trend toward prolonged time-to-failure for mice in the combination treatment group. In conclusion, PI3K inhibitors are promising agents in the treatment of glioblastomas, especially when used in combination with ionizing radiation.",Excluded,0.77486116

BACKGROUND: Brain irradiation is the traditional treatment for NSCLC patients with brain metastases, whereas combined with chemotherapy is the nowadays treatment direction. Since sequential/maintenance chemotherapy has shown promising results in advanced NSCLC, we carried out the study to explore the role of sequential chemotherapy combined with brain radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases.METHODS: Treatment naive NSCLC patients with brain metastases sequentially received the 3 chemotherapy regimens TP-NP-GP. The TP regimen consisted of Paclitaxol 175 mg/m(2) d1, Cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) d1-5. The NP regimen consisted of Nevalbine 25 mg/m(2) d1 and 8, Cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) d1-5. The GP regimen consisted of Gemcitabine 1 g/m(2) d1 and 8, Cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) d1-5. All regimens were repeated every 3 weeks. Each regimen was executed for at least 2 cycles and no more than 4 cycles.RESULTS: The response rates of TP, NP and GP sequentially used were 41.2%, 35.6% and 27.8% respectively for the out brain lesions and 60.8% for the brain lesions combining with brain irradiation.

650,"The impact of prophylactic cranial irradiation for post-operative patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer. To evaluate the impact of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) on the prognosis of patients who received definitive surgery for surgically resected small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A retrospective analysis was performed on post-operative SCLC patients treated in Zhejiang Cancer Hospital from January 2003 to December 2015. According to the treatment modality, patients were allocated to PCI group and non-PCI group. Univariate survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate survival analysis was performed by a Cox proportional hazards model.A total of 52 patients were included for analysis, among which, 19 patients were in PCI group and 33 were in non-PCI group. Multivariate analysis revealed that PCI (HR = .330; P = .041) was an independently favorable prognostic factor for the overall survival. The median overall survival (OS) time was 32.9 months in PCI group, and 20.4 months in non-PCI group. The 2-year OS rates were 78.0% and 38.0% in PCI and non-PCI group respectively (P = .023). The brain metastasis-free survival (BMFS) rate at 2-year in PCI group was significantly higher than those of non-PCI group (89.0% vs 53.0%, respectively, P = .026).

651,"Protective Effects of Magnesium Sulfate on Radiation Induced Brain Injury in Rats. OBJECTIVES: The effect of magnesium sulfate on brain tissue of SD rats irradiated by 6MeV electron was investigated.METHODS: SD rats were divided into three groups: control group, irradiation (IR group) and irradiation treated with magnesium sulfate (IR+M group). After being anesthetized, the whole brains of IR group and IR+M group were exposed to 6 MeV electron radiation. IR+M group was i.p. injected with 10% magnesium sulfate (400 mg/kg) one day before radiation and three days and five days after radiation. And on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th day after radiation, SD rats were euthanatized to take brain tissue for the detection of calcium, redox status and cell apoptosis, as well as the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1.RESULTS: The results indicated that magnesium treatment may alleviate the elevation of calcium and enhance redox status through increasing the activities of superoxide dimutase (SOD) and myeloperodase (MPO), and decreasing the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). Tunnel and immunohistochemistry assay suggested that treatment with magnesium decreased the apoptosis rate of brain cells and the expressions of caspase-3, respectively. Decline of the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 protein was observed after the treatment of magnesium.CONCLUSION: All the results demonstrated that magnesium may elicit protective effect against radiationinduced brain injury by reducing calcium overload, improving redox and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Moreover, magnesium significantly down-regulated the protein or mRNA levels of NF-kappaB and ICAM- 1. The findings may provide references for the application of magnesium in clinic for brain injury induced by radiation.",Included,0.92386854

Objective: We studied the effect of reirradiation to the vestibular apparatus in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC). Patients and Methods: A total of 52 reirradiated NPC patients underwent regular follow-up at Tzu Chi Hospital. Nine were diagnosed with vestibular apparatus disorders, based on detailed histories and balance function tests which included an illegible E-test, and refixation saccade test as well as bithermal air caloric and rotary chair tests. The clinical characteristics were analyzed. Result(s): Of 9 patients with vestibular apparatus disorders, seven had bilateral loss of vestibular function, one had vestibular neuronitis and one had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The 7 patients with bilateral loss of vestibular function had bilateral otitis media and moderate to profound bilateral hearing loss. Illegible E-test, refixation saccade test, electronystagmography, bithermal air caloric test and rotary chair test are useful tools for diagnosis. All 9 patients received total radiation dosages over 12,000 cGy.

654,"Gut flora-targeted photobiomodulation therapy improves senile dementia in an As-induced Alzheimer's disease animal model. BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota plays an important role in the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy is believed to have a positive regulatory effect on the imbalance of certain body functions, including inflammation, immunity, wound healing, nerve repair, and pain. Previous studies have found that the intestinal flora of patients with AD is in an unbalanced state. Therefore, we have proposed the use of gut flora-targeted PBM (gf-targeted PBM) as a method to improve AD in an As-induced AD mouse model.METHODS: PBM was performed on the abdomen of the mice at the wavelengths of 630 nm, 730 nm, and 850 nm at 100 J/cm<sup>2</sup> for 8 weeks. Morris water maze test, immunofluorescence and proteomic of hippocampus, and intestinal flora detection of fecal were used to evaluate the treatment effects of gf-targeted PBM on AD rats.RESULTS: PBM at all three wavelengths (especially 630 nm and 730 nm) significantly improved learning retention as measured by the Morris water maze. In addition, we found reduced amyloidosis and tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus by immunofluorescence in AD mice. By using a quantitative proteomic analysis of the hippocampus, we found that gf-targeted PBM significantly altered the expression levels of 509 proteins (the same differentially expressed proteins in all three wavelengths of PBM), which involved the pathways of hormone synthesis, phagocytosis, and metabolism. The 16 s rRNA gene sequencing of fecal contents showed that PBM significantly altered the diversity and abundance of intestinal flora. Specifically, PBM treatment reversed the typical increase of Helicobacter and uncultured Bacteroidales and the decrease of Rikenella seen in AD mice.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that gf-targeted PBM regulates the diversity of intestinal flora, which may improve damage caused by AD. Gf-targeted PBM has the potential to be a noninvasive microflora regulation method for AD patients.",Excluded,0.10827567
655,"Strong resetting of the mammalian clock by constant light followed by constant darkness. The mammalian molecular circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) regulates locomotor activity rhythms as well as clocks in peripheral tissues (Reppert and Weaver, 2002; Ko and Takahashi, 2006). Constant light (LL) can induce behavioral and physiological arrhythmicity by desynchronizing clock cells in the SCN (Ohta et al., 2005). We examined how the disordered clock cells resynchronize by probing the molecular clock and measuring behavior in mice transferred from LL to constant darkness (DD). The circadian locomotor activity rhythms disrupted in LL become robustly rhythmic again from the beginning of DD, and the starting phase of the rhythm in DD is specific, not random, suggesting that the desynchronized clock cells are quickly reset in an unconventional manner by the L/D transition. By measuring mPERIOD protein rhythms, we showed that the SCN and peripheral tissue clocks quickly become rhythmic again in phase with the behavioral rhythms. We propose that this resetting mechanism may be different from conventional phase shifting, which involves light induction of Period genes (Albrecht et al., 1997; Shearman et al., 1997; Shigeyoshi et al., 1997). Using our functional insights, we could shift the circadian phase of locomotor activity rhythms by 12 h using a 15 h LL treatment: essentially producing phase reversal by a single light pulse, a feat that has not been reported previously in wild-type mice and that has potential clinical utility.",Excluded,0.10422586
656,"Treatment of posterior pelvic ring disruptions using a minimally invasive adjustable plate. OBJECTIVE: Iliosacral (IS) screw fixation and posterior tension band plate (TBP) technique are two treatment alternatives for posterior pelvic ring injuries. However, IS screw fixation requires continuous fluoroscopic guidance for appropriate screw insertion and carries a risk of neurovascular injuries. TBP technique also has some disadvantages, including limited reduction potential, difficulty in precontouring the plate and a higher rate of symptomatic implants. To address these limitations, we introduced a minimally invasive adjustable plate (MIAP). This study aims to present the preliminary radiological and clinical results of posterior pelvic ring disruptions treated with MIAP.METHODS: The MIAP conforms to the irregular shape of posterior pelvic ring and can be used without prebending. This plate has a role in reducing compressed or separated fractures/dislocations. Sixteen patients, including seven males and nine females, were treated with MIAP through a minimally invasive approach. The fracture patterns consisted of six Type B and ten Type C fractures according to OTA classification of fracture. Preoperative and postoperative radiography was taken to assess the fracture displacement and reduction quality. Postoperative rehabilitation programme was individualised and early exercise was encouraged. Patients were followed up and the functional outcome was evaluated based upon the scoring system proposed by Lindahl and associates.RESULTS: All posterior pelvic ring disruptions were reduced and fixed with MIAP. The average duration of surgery was 49 min, the average radiation exposure was 6s, and the average blood loss was 80 mL for the treatment of posterior pelvic ring injuries. Overall radiological results of the reduction were excellent in eleven patients and good in five. The patients were followed up for 30 months on average. All fractures healed. The functional outcome was excellent in ten patients, good in four and fair in two. There were no iatrogenic neurovascular injuries, implant failures, irritative symptoms or pressure sores due to subcutaneous implantation.CONCLUSION: Favourable clinical and radiological outcomes can be achieved in treating posterior pelvic disruptions with MIAP.

657,"Upregulation of Connexin-43 is Critical for Irradiation-induced Neuroinflammation. BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy is widely used for the treatment of pituitary adenomas. Unfortunately, it might raise the risk of ischemic stroke, with neuroinflammation being a major pathological process. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system and have been reported for playing important roles in ischemic stroke.OBJECTIVE: Here we studied how gamma-radiation would introduce astrocytes into a detrimental state for neuroinflammation and provide new theory evidence and target for the clinical management of inflammation- related neural damage after radiation-induced ischemic stroke.METHOD: HA-1800 cells were treated with gamma-radiation and then the protein and mRNA levels of Connexin (Cx)-43 were evaluated by western and q-PCR. The culture supernatant was collected and the concentrations of the inflammatory factors were determined by ELISA. MiRNA complementary to Cx-43 was designed through the online tools.RESULTS: Cx-43 is upregulated in the treatment of gamma-radiation in astrocytes and gamma-radiation introduced the detrimental function of astrocytes: cell viability was reduced while the apoptotic cells were increased. Inflammatory factors like tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin-6, interleukin 1-beta were dramatically up-regulated by the irradiation. MiR-374a rescued irradiation induced Cx-43 up-regulation of astrocytes and eliminated detrimental function triggered by gamma-radiation.CONCLUSION: Cx-43 expression level may play an important role in the inflammation-related neural damage after irradiation-induced ischemic stroke.",Included,0.9236385
658,"Long-term recurrence and brain metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma mimicking cystic radiation encephalopathy relapse: a case report. BACKGROUND: During medical imaging, cystic radiation encephalopathy and brain metastasis are difficult to differentiate, and hence they are easily misdiagnosed. To our knowledge, a nasopharyngeal carcinoma recurrence after more than seven years with cerebral metastasis that mimicked cystic radiation encephalopathy has not been reported.CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old man was admitted to the hospital owing to weakness of the right limb for one month, which increased in intensity for three days. He had been diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in 2011, which was treated by radiotherapy. The patient successively developed cystic radiation encephalopathy and brain metastasis from the nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which mimicked cystic radiation encephalopathy relapse. Left frontotemporal craniotomy, surgical resection of brain metastasis, and repair of the skull base and dura were performed. Postoperative computed tomography showed that midline deviation recovered, and brain edema was reduced.CONCLUSIONS: This report is significant because brain metastasis from nasopharyngeal carcinoma can masquerade as a benign entity and cause fatal consequences. In patients presenting with cystic radiation encephalopathy, brain metastasis should be considered as a differential diagnosis.",Excluded,0.10330249
659,"Spinal and supraspinal effects of long-term stimulation of sensorimotor cortex in rats. Sensorimotor cortex (SMC) modifies spinal cord reflex function throughout life and is essential for operant conditioning of the H-reflex. To further explore this long-term SMC influence over spinal cord function and its possible clinical uses, we assessed the effect of long-term SMC stimulation on the soleus H-reflex. In freely moving rats, the soleus H-reflex was measured 24 h/day for 12 wk. The soleus background EMG and M response associated with H-reflex elicitation were kept stable throughout. SMC stimulation was delivered in a 20-day-on/20-day-off/20-day-on protocol in which a train of biphasic 1-ms pulses at 25 Hz for 1 s was delivered every 10 s for the on-days. The SMC stimulus was automatically adjusted to maintain a constant descending volley. H-reflex size gradually increased during the 20 on-days, stayed high during the 20 off-days, and rose further during the next 20 on-days. In addition, the SMC stimulus needed to maintain a stable descending volley rose steadily over days. It fell during the 20 off-days and rose again when stimulation resumed. These results suggest that SMC stimulation, like H-reflex operant conditioning, induces activity-dependent plasticity in both the brain and the spinal cord and that the plasticity responsible for the H-reflex increase persists longer after the end of SMC stimulation than that underlying the change in the SMC response to stimulation.",Excluded,0.10466604

661,"Vasodilation by in vivo activation of astrocyte endfeet via two-photon calcium uncaging as a strategy to prevent brain ischemia. Decreased cerebral blood flow causes brain ischemia and plays an important role in the pathophysiology of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. In this study, we photomodulated astrocytes in the live animal by a combination of two-photon calcium uncaging in the astrocyte endfoot and in vivo imaging of neurovasculature and astrocytes by intravital two-photon microscopy after labeling with cell type specific fluorescent dyes. Our study demonstrates that photomodulation at the endfoot of a single astrocyte led to a 25% increase in the diameter of a neighboring arteriole, which is a crucial factor regulating cerebral microcirculation in downstream capillaries. Two-photon uncaging in the astrocyte soma or endfoot near veins does not show the same effect on microcirculation. These experimental results suggest that infrared photomodulation on astrocyte endfeet may be a strategy to increase cerebral local microcirculation and thus prevent brain ischemia.",Excluded,0.10281047

Objective: To present a rare case of Nelson's syndrome treated with surgeries and radiation with multiple recurrences and subsequent development of pituitary apoplexy. Clinical case:A 66-year-old man with a history of Cushing's syndrome was treated with subtotal adrenalectomy and external pituitary irradiation in 1964. In 2004 he was diagnosed with Nelson's syndrome. MRI demonstrated 1 x 2 cm pituitary macroadenoma invading the right cavernous sinus and suprasellar cistern. The patient underwent transsphenoidal resection (TSSR) of the tumor in 2005. However, ACTH level increased to 8,310 pg/mL within a year. At the same time, right-sided ptosis and diplopia developed. MRI revealed further enlargement of the adenoma. The patient underwent craniotomy in 2006 and most of the tumor was removed except for a small residual portion invading the wall of the carotid artery. Although ACTH reached a nadir of 1,543 pg/mL postoperatively, it rebounded to 14,652 pg/mL in nine months. Another MRI revealed recurrent pituitary macroadenoma and in 2008 the patient again underwent TSSR of the tumor followed by radiation. Treatment with cabergoline and octreotide was initiated but the response was only transient as both ACTH and residual tumor increased. In November of 2012, patient presented to the emergency room with severe headache and palsy of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. A MRI revealed 3.2 cm pituitary adenoma with suprasellar extension and encasement of the right internal carotid artery, but no hemorrhage, midline shift, or mass effect was noted. One week after hospitalization, serum ACTH declined to 2183 pg/mL and headaches completely resolved. Clinical diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy was established. Discussion(s): Pituitary apoplexy is a known complication of Nelson's Syndrome. Previous literature has described increased frequency of apoplexy in the setting of Nelson's syndrome when compared to pituitary adenomas in general (1). Although apoplexy is commonly accompanied by evidence of hemorrhage or necrosis on imaging, it is not required for the diagnosis (2). Conclusion(s): We present a case of pituitary apoplexy in a patient with Nelson's syndrome resistant to surgical, medical and radiation therapy. Apoplexy was confirmed clinically and biochemically, without evidence of hemorrhage on imaging. This case illustrates the clinical course and complications of Nelson's syndrome.",Excluded,0.11067714
665,"Phase 1/2 study of dianhydrogalactitol (VAL-083) with radiation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed, mgmt-unmethylated glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer. Current standard-of-care includes surgery followed by chemoradiation and temozolomide. An unmethylated promoter for O6-methylguanine- DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) is a validated biomarker for temozolomide-resistance and is strongly correlated with poor outcomes. Unmethylated MGMT represents the majority of newly diagnosed GBM tumors. VAL-083 is a first-in-class bi-functional DNA-targeting agent that has shown activity against GBM in NCI-sponsored clinical trials both as single agent and in combination with radiotherapy. VAL-083 induces interstrand cross-links at N7-guanine, leading to DNA double-strand breaks and cell-death. VAL-083s unique mechanism-of-action circumvents MGMT-mediated chemoresistance, and it has demonstrated cytotoxicity in MGMT-unmethylated GBM cell-lines, cancer stem cells (CSCs) and in vivo models. Furthermore, VAL-083 acts as a radiosensitizer in GBM CSCs and non-CSCs. We completed a dose-escalation trial of VAL-083 in recurrent GBM, and a generally well-tolerated dosing regimen was selected for further clinical development. The present trial is an ongoing open-label, biomarker-driven, Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of VAL-083 in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed MGMTunmethylated GBM patients.

667,"Cellular Senescence in Mouse Hippocampus After Irradiation and the Role of p53 and p21. Diverse stress signals including irradiation may trigger cellular senescence. We asked whether irradiation induced senescence in mouse hippocampus, and whether p53 or p21 played a role in this response. Following whole-brain irradiation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays for senescence-associated genes showed increased expression of CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN2A (p19ARF) in mouse hippocampus at 9 weeks. Upregulation of p21 and p19ARF was confirmed using real-time PCR, which also demonstrated increased CDKN2A/p16INKa expression after irradiation. No altered regulation of another 17 senescence-associated genes was observed after irradiation. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased nuclear expression of p16INK4A, p19ARF, p53, p21, phosphorylated p38 (pp38), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and interleukin-6 (IL6) in granule cells of dentate gyrus after irradiation. Increased p16 nuclear immunoreactivity was further observed in type -1 cells, the putative neural stem cells. gamma-phosphorylated-histone-2A nuclear foci were also seen in dentate gyrus 9 weeks postirradiation. In nonirradiated mice knockout of the TRP53 or p21 gene, there was increased p16INK4A, p19ARF, and IL6, but not pp38 in dentate gyrus. We conclude that irradiation induces transcript and protein expression profile alterations in mouse dentate gyrus consistent with the senescence phenotype. Absence of p53 or p21 results in increase in baseline expression of senescence markers with no further increase in expression after irradiation.",Included,0.9239544

Although the survival rate for GBM has improved with recent advancements in treatment, the prognosis remains generally poor. METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of GBM patients seen in National University Hospital, Singapore, and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, from January 2002 to December 2011. Data on disease and treatment factors was collected and correlated with survival. RESULTS Data on a total of 107 GBM patients was analysed. Their median survival time was 15.1 months and the two-year survival rate was 23.5%, which is comparable with data published in other series. The factors associated with improved median survival time were radiotherapy dose > 50 Gy (16.1 months vs. 8.7 months, p = 0.01) and adjuvant concurrent chemotherapy (16.4 months vs. 9.2 months, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION GBM confers a poor prognosis. Adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy are associated with improved survival.

669,"Carbenoxolone impairs LTP and blocks NMDA receptors in murine hippocampus. Effects of the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone (CBX) on tetanus- and taurine-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) were studied on Schaffer collateral-CA1 field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in mouse hippocampal slices. Preincubation with 10 microM CBX reduced the amount of LTP induced by weak theta-burst stimulation (TBS) or a single train of stimuli (HFS; 1s at 100 Hz), but did not affect LTP induced by 30-min perfusion with 10 mM taurine. Incubation with 50-100 microM CBX 15 min before HFS or TBS abolished tetanus-induced LTP. At 100 microM CBX, the concentration that is used for the blockade of gap junctions in vitro, a long-lasting depression of fEPSPs was observed which persisted under the blockade of NMDA receptors, and receptors for corticosteroids. A similar depression was produced by the CBX inactive analogue glycyrrhizic acid and the broad spectrum calcium channel antagonist ruthenium red. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from acutely isolated CA1 pyramidal neurons showed that CBX exerts a selective dose-dependent inhibition of NMDA-evoked currents with an IC(50)=104 microM. Thus the widely used gap junction uncoupler CBX acts as an antagonist at NMDA receptors and consequently impairs the induction of LTP.",Excluded,0.10451715

Spike activity was studied in 95 neurons in the basal magnocellular nucleus in rabbits during spontaneous behavior and during performance of a conditioned operant response. Nearly half the neurons (48.4%) showed significant (p < 0.05) negative correlations between spontaneous discharges and the power of the frontal lobe EEG delta rhythm; most of these cells could be identified as cholinergic projection neurons. Neurons of this group had predominantly excitatory responses to the conditioned stimulus during performance of the operant task, while the responses to the conditioned stimulus of presumptively non-cholinergic neurons, not projecting to the cortex, were mainly inhibitory. The activatory responses of neurons in the basal magnocellular nucleus to the conditioned stimulus were markedly stronger while the animals performed the operant response as compared with performances in which there was no response to the conditioned stimulus. These results provide evidence that the basal magnocellular nucleus supports the level of waking and attending required for performance of operant conditioned reflex activity.",Excluded,0.10339271
672,"Total-body PET: Maximizing sensitivity to create new opportunities for clinical research and patient care. PET is widely considered the most sensitive technique available for noninvasively studying physiology, metabolism, and molecular pathways in the living human being. However, the utility of PET, being a photon-deficient modality, remains constrained by factors including low signal-to-noise ratio, long imaging times, and concerns about radiation dose. Two developments offer the potential to dramatically increase the effective sensitivity of PET. First by increasing the geometric coverage to encompass the entire body, sensitivity can be increased by a factor of about 40 for total-body imaging or a factor of about 4-5 for imaging a single organ such as the brain or heart. The world's first total-body PET/CT scanner is currently under construction to demonstrate how this step change in sensitivity affects the way PET is used both in clinical research and in patient care. Second, there is the future prospect of significant improvements in timing resolution that could lead to further effective sensitivity gains. When combined with total-body PET, this could produce overall sensitivity gains of more than 2 orders of magnitude compared with existing state-of-the-art systems. In this article, we discuss the benefits of increasing body coverage, describe our efforts to develop a first-generation total-body PET/CT scanner, discuss selected application areas for total-body PET, and project the impact of further improvements in time-of-flight PET.

675,"Single-neuron perturbations reveal feature-specific competition in V1. The computations performed by local neural populations, such as a cortical layer, are typically inferred from anatomical connectivity and observations of neural activity. Here we describe a method-influence mapping-that uses single-neuron perturbations to directly measure how cortical neurons reshape sensory representations. In layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex (V1), we use two-photon optogenetics to trigger action potentials in a targeted neuron and calcium imaging to measure the effect on spiking in neighbouring neurons in awake mice viewing visual stimuli. Excitatory neurons on average suppressed other neurons and had a centre-surround influence profile over anatomical space. A neuron's influence on its neighbour depended on their similarity in activity. Notably, neurons suppressed activity in similarly tuned neurons more than in dissimilarly tuned neurons. In addition, photostimulation reduced the population response, specifically to the targeted neuron's preferred stimulus, by around 2%. Therefore, V1 layer 2/3 performed feature competition, in which a like-suppresses-like motif reduces redundancy in population activity and may assist with inference of the features that underlie sensory input. We anticipate that influence mapping can be extended to investigate computations in other neural populations.",Excluded,0.103921786

Objectives: This study aimed to compare radiotherapy plan quality of coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (CO-VMAT) and non-coplanar VMAT (NC-VMAT) for post-operative primary brain tumour.Methods: A total of 16 patients who were treated for primary brain tumours were retrospectively selected for this study. For each patient, identical CT sets with structures were used for both CO-VMAT and NC-VMAT planning. For CO-VMAT, one full arc and two coplanar half arcs were used. For NC-VMAT, one full coplanar and two non-coplanar half arcs with couch rotation of 315degree or 45degree were used. Dose constraints were adhered to the RTOG 0614, RTOG 0933 and TMH protocol. Dose volumetric parameters were collected for statistical analysis.Results: .NC-VMAT achieved significant dose reduction in contralateral hippocampus, both temporal lobes and cochleae, and other OARs while the plan qualities remained the same. In particular, NC-VMAT decreased contralateral hippocampus mean dose by 1.67Gy. Similarly, the NC-VMAT decreased temporal lobe mean dose by 6.29Gy and 2.8Gy for ipsilateral and contralateral side respectively. Furthermore, it decreased cochlea mean dose by 5.34Gy and 0.97Gy for ipsilateral and contralateral side respectively. Overall, there was a reduction of 5.4% of normal brain tissue volume receiving low dose irradiation.Conclusion: The proposed NC-VMAT showed more favourable plan quality than the CO-VMAT for primary brain tumours, in particular to hippocampus, temporal lobes, cochleae and OARs located to the contralateral side of tumours.Advances in knowledge: For primary brain tumours radiotherapy, NC-VMAT can reduce doses to the hippocampus, both temporal lobes, and cochleae, as well as OARs located to the contralateral side of tumours.",Excluded,0.103696786
677,"Monte Carlo calculated output factors of a Leksell Gamma Knife unit. The Leksell Gamma Knife is a standard radiosurgical tool for treating brain lesions by directing beams of gamma radiation to a specific region. The diameter of the gamma beams is confined by collimator systems and available collimator sizes are 4, 8, 14 and 18 mm. The reduction in dose rate for each collimator helmet is called the output factor (OPF). Experimental determination of OPFs is difficult due to the extremely narrow beams for which the dose is determined. In the present work, the PRESTA version of the EGS4 Monte Carlo code was used to obtain relative OPFs for the Leksell Gamma Knife for collimator sizes of 14, 8 and 4 mm (relative to that of the 18 mm collimator). A spherical probe with a radius of 1 mm was utilized in this computer experiment. Our Monte Carlo results gave OPFs of 0.974, 0.951 and 0.872 for the 14 mm, 8 mm and 4 mm collimators respectively, relative to the 18 mm collimator.

Central sensitization represents a sustained hypersensitive state of dorsal horn nociceptive neurons that can be evoked by peripheral inflammation or injury to nerves and tissues. It reflects neuroplastic changes such as increases in neuronal spontaneous activity, receptive field size, and responses to suprathreshold stimuli and a decrease in activation threshold. We recently demonstrated that purinergic receptor mechanisms in trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc; medullary dorsal horn) are also involved in the initiation and maintenance of central sensitization in brain stem nociceptive neurons of trigeminal subnucleus oralis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether endogenous ATP is involved in the development of central sensitization in Vc itself. The experiments were carried out on urethan/alpha-chloralose anesthetized and immobilized rats. Single neurons were recorded and identified as nociceptive-specific (NS) in the deep laminae of Vc. During continuous saline superfusion (0.6 ml/h it) over the caudal medulla, Vc neuronal central sensitization was readily induced by mustard oil application to the tooth pulp. However, this mustard-oil-induced central sensitization could be completely blocked by continuous intrathecal superfusion of the wide-spectrum P2X receptor antagonist pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2, 4-disulphonic acid tetra-sodium (33-100 microM) and by apyrase (an ectonucleotidase enzyme, 30 units/ml). Superfusion of the selective P2X1, P2X3 and P2X(2/3) receptor antagonist 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate (6-638 microM) partially blocked the Vc central sensitization. The two P2X receptor antagonists did not significantly affect the baseline nociceptive properties of the Vc neurons. These findings implicate endogenous ATP as an important mediator contributing to the development of central sensitization in nociceptive neurons of the deep laminae of the dorsal horn.",Excluded,0.10289696
682,"Skin denervation, neuropathology, and neuropathic pain in a laser-induced focal neuropathy. Small-diameter sensory nerves innervating the skin are responsive to noxious stimuli, and an injury to these nerves is presumably related to neuropathic pain. Injury-induced neuropathic pain in animals can be produced by laser irradiation, which usually requires concomitant use of photosensitive dyes, known as the photochemical approach. It is not clear whether laser irradiation alone can induce neuropathic pain. In addition, two issues are important to apply these approaches: the relationship between the extent of laser irradiation and the occurrence of neuropathic pain, and the susceptibility of small-diameter sensory nerves in the skin to laser-induced neuropathic pain. To address these issues, we designed a new model of focal neuropathy by applying a diode laser of 532 nm (100 mW) to the sciatic nerve and evaluated small-diameter nerves by quantifying skin innervation and large-diameter nerves by measuring amplitudes of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP). Immediately after laser irradiation, epineurial vessels were occluded due to the formation of thrombi, and the blood flow through these vessels was markedly reduced. On postoperative day (POD) 2, animals developed characteristic manifestations of neuropathic pain, including spontaneous pain behaviors, thermal hyperalgesia, and mechanical allodynia. These phenomena peaked during PODs 7-21, and lasted for 3-6 weeks. The neuropathology at the irradiated site of the sciatic nerve included a focal area of axonal degeneration surrounded by demyelination and endoneurial edema. The extent of damage to large-diameter motor and sensory nerves after laser irradiation was evaluated by nerve conduction studies. On the irradiated sides, amplitudes of the compound muscle action potentials and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) were reduced to 65.0% (P < 0.0001) and 42.5% (P < 0.01) of those on the control sides, respectively. Motor innervation of the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) on plantar muscles was examined by combined cholinesterase histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. The ratio of innervated NMJs on the operated sides decreased to 76.3% of that on the control side. Skin innervation in the territory of the irradiated sciatic nerves was evaluated by immunohistochemistry with neuronal markers. Among these markers, epidermal nerve densities for protein gene product (PGP) 9.5, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P (SP) were significantly lower on the irradiated sides than the control sides with a different degree of loss for each marker (42.1-53.1%, P < 0.05).

Background: After each cycle of [<sup>177</sup>Lu]-DOTA-TATE peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) dosimetry is performed to enable precise calculation of the radiation-absorbed dose to tumors and normal organs. Absorbed doses are routinely calculated from three quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies corrected by computed tomography (CT) acquired at t<inf>1</inf> = 24 h, t<inf>2</inf> = 96 h, and t<inf>3</inf> = 168 h after the first cycle of treatment. After following cycles, a single SPECT/CT study is performed. The aim of the present study is to assess the feasibility of a ""two time point"" quantitative SPECT/CT protocol after the first PRRT cycle and its impact on patient management. Quantitative SPECT/CT data of 25 consecutive patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors after PRRT were retrospectively analyzed. Radiation-absorbed doses calculated using the standard protocol with three SPECT/CT studies acquired at (t<inf>1</inf>, t<inf>2</inf>, t<inf>3</inf>) were compared to those obtained from three different ""two time point"" protocols with SPECT/CT studies performed at (t<inf>1</inf>, t<inf>2</inf>), (t<inf>1</inf>, t<inf>3</inf>), or (t<inf>2</inf>, t<inf>3</inf>). Result(s): The best agreement for the cumulative doses absorbed by the kidneys, bone marrow, liver, spleen, and tumors with the conventional protocol was obtained with the (t<inf>1</inf>, t<inf>3</inf>) protocol with mean relative differences of - 1.0% +/- 2.4%, 0.4% +/- 3.1%, - 0.9% +/- 4.0%, - 0.8% +/- 1.1%, and - 0.5% +/- 2.0%, respectively, and correlation coefficients of r = 0.99 for all. In all patients, there was no difference in the management decision of whether or not to stop PRRT because of unsafe absorbed dose to risk organs using either the standard protocol or the (t<inf>1</inf>, t<inf>3</inf>) protocol. Conclusion(s): These preliminary results demonstrate that dosimetry calculations using two quantitative SPECT/CT studies acquired at 24 and 168 h after the first PRRT cycle are feasible and are in good agreement with the standard imaging protocol with no change in patient management decisions, while enabling improved patient comfort and reduced scanner and staff time.

Purpose: Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the brain tumor with the worst prognosis, especially for patients with gross residual tumor after surgery (RPA classes V and VI). In vitro studies demonstrated the hyper-radiosensitivity of human malignant glioma cell lines to low radiation doses, moreover preclinical studies hypothesized a synergism between low doses fractionated radiotherapy (LD-FRT) and chemotherapy. Therefore we planned a pilot study to define the feasibility and the efficacy of this approach in na GBM RPA classes V-VI. Materials: Patients enrolled in the study had the following characteristics: histological diagnosis of GBM, based on minimal surgical resection or biopsy; age 18-80 years; RPA classes V-VI; estimated survival 3 months; normal haematological, renal, hepatic, cardiac and respiratory functions. Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) was defined as the surgical bed with gross residual contrast-enhancing tissue on magnetic resonance imaging. The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) was defined as the GTV with a 30 mm margin to incluDe any potential subclinical tumor. The Planning Target Volume (PTV) was defined as CTV + 5 mm, due to set-up uncertainties. Hypofractionated 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) was delivered on GTV (total dose: 30 Gy in fractions of 3 Gy/day) with concomitant and adjuvant (1 cycle) temozolomiDe (TMZ). From second to fifth cycle of adjuvant TMZ (200 mg/m2), if neither progression disease was demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging, nor unacceptable toxicities were recorded, LD-FRT was associated (2 daily fractions of 0.40 Gy, over 5 days, q 28). Primary endpoint of the study was the evaluation of toxicity and safety of this schedula (RTOG criteria). Clinical response (RECIST criteria), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were also evaluated. Result(s): From June 2008 to October 2010 15 patients with a newly diagnosis of GBM were enrolled in this study. Eight patients underwent incomplete surgical resection and 7 patients received only biopsy. The median total dose of LD-FRT delivered was 1040 cGy (range 320 1920). Up to this date 11 patients are evaluable.

Five (0.6%) patients developed new focal deficits, 12 (1.4%) patients experienced a seizure and there were three (0.4%) deaths. Two deaths were related to development of seizures and neurological deterioration. One death was caused by a respiratory arrest related to the patient's primary cancer. Of the five patients with neurological deficits, none had a persistent deficit. In two cases the neurological deficits were due to an increase in edema.

Pathological complete response (pCR) rate, safety profile and identification of biomarkers for early response prediction are the main endpoints. Result(s): Sixty five pts with median age 60 have been enrolled to date. Fifty seven pts completed the full protocol scheme, with a relative dose intensity of 97% for bevacizumab, 95% for capecitabine and 93% for oxaliplatin. Preliminary safety data from 60 evaluable pts show that the regimen is generally well tolerated. Most severe adverse events were post-operative (wound infections, leaks) in 9 pts, equally distributed between arms. During CRT, grade 3 toxicities were more frequent in Arm A: fatigue (1), diarrhea (2), infection (2), febrile neutropenia (1), sensory neuropathy (1). Two pts deceased due to disease progression and one due to lung embolism post-surgery.

690,"Cardiotoxicity of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Patients with Lung Cancer. Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) activate the host immune system to target cancer cells. However, the unchecked systemic inflammatory response may result in cardiovascular immune-related adverse events, as myocarditis, pericardial disease, stress-induced, and dilated cardiomyopathy are increasingly reported in case series and pharmacovigilance databases. We sought to further investigate ICI-related cardiotoxicity in a cohort of patients with lung cancer. Method(s): We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of primary lung cancer treated with ICIs or non-ICI systemic therapy over three years to assess the likelihood of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. Data was collected on co-morbidities, cardiovascular medications, past or concurrent radiation or systemic therapies, serum troponin, brain natriuretic peptide levels, pre- and post-treatment electrocardiograms, echocardiography, angiography, and total ICI dose. Each factor was compared between patients treated with ICIs and non-ICI systemic therapy. Result(s): We included 252 patients in our study. During a median follow-up of 6 months (interquartile range: 2-14 months), patients treated with ICIs (n = 135) who had a troponin elevation were more likely to sustain a MACE (hazard ratio: 6.9, 95% confidence interval: 3.2-15, p <0.001) with a median time to event of 33 days (Figure 1). Discussion(s): Patients with lung cancer on ICIs are more likely to incur a troponin elevation compared to patients on conventional chemotherapy. Elevated troponin is associated with an increased likelihood of MACE, especially early during treatment with ICIs. This data supports closer monitoring, including serial troponin measurements during the early phase of ICI therapy. Copyright © 2019",Excluded,0.105556875

696,"Contrasting the effects of proton irradiation on dendritic complexity of subiculum neurons in wild type and MCAT mice. Growing evidence suggests that radiation-induced oxidative stress directly affects a wide range of biological changes with an overall negative impact on CNS function. In the past we have demonstrated that transgenic mice over-expressing human catalase targeted to the mitochondria (MCAT) exhibit a range of neuroprotective phenotypes following irradiation that include improved neurogenesis, dendritic complexity, and cognition. To determine the extent of the neuroprotective phenotype afforded by MCAT expression in different hippocampal regions, we analyzed subiculum neurons for changes in neuronal structure and synaptic integrity after exposure to low dose (0.5 Gy) 150 MeV proton irradiation. One month following irradiation of WT and MCAT mice, a range of morphometric parameters were quantified along Golgi-Cox impregnated neurons. Compared with WT mice, subiculum neurons from MCAT mice exhibited increased trends (albeit not statistically significant) toward increased dendritic complexity in both control and irradiated cohorts. However, Sholl analysis of MCAT mice revealed significantly increased arborization of the distal dendritic tree, indicating a protective effect on secondary and tertiary branching. Interestingly, radiation-induced increases in postsynaptic density protein (PSD-95) puncta were not as pronounced in MCAT compared with WT mice, and were significantly lower after the 0.5 Gy dose. As past data has linked radiation exposure to reduced dendritic complexity, elevated PSD-95 and impaired cognition, reductions in mitochondrial oxidative stress have proven useful in ameliorating many of these radiation-induced sequelae. Data presented here shows similar trends, and again points to the potential benefits of reducing oxidative stress in the brain to attenuate radiation injury. Environ. Mol.

Objectives: To determine the feasibility of using a 70-kVp protocol compared with a 120-kVp protocol for cerebral CT angiography. An additional target was to investigate a possible reduction in the volume of contrast medium (CM) using the 70-kVp protocol. Methods: Attenuation value and CNR for iodine were determined at various tube voltage settings using a phantom. Sixty-nine volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three protocols: group A (120-kVp and CM 64 mL), group B (70-kVp and CM 64 mL), or group C (70-kVp and CM 40 mL). The attenuation value, SNR, and CNR of cerebral arteries, subjective image quality, and radiation dose were compared among the groups. Results: The vascular attenuation, SNR, and CNR of group B were significantly higher than those of group A. Group C had a significantly higher vascular attenuation than group A. Groups B and C were significantly better than group A with respect to subjective image quality. An effective dose of 70-kVp was 10 % lower than that of 120-kVp. Conclusions: Using 70-kVp improved arterial enhancement, SNR, and CNR, and provided better subjective image quality, using a 10 % lower effective dose. Furthermore, the 70-kVp protocol may both reduce volume of CM by 37.5 % and improve arterial enhancement.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of an 80-kVp protocol using a moderate concentration contrast material (MC-CM) for cerebral computed tomography angiography by comparison with a conventional 120-kVp protocol using a high concentration contrast material (HC-CM).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Attenuation values and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were determined in a head phantom for 2 tube voltages (80 and 120 kVp) and 2 different iodine concentration contrast materials (HC-CM and MC-CM). Among 90 consecutive patients, 45 patients were scanned with 120 kVp and 150 mAs(eff) after administration of 70 mL of HC-CM (370 mg iodine [mgI]/mL), whereas the other 45 patients were scanned with 80 kVp and 370 mAs(eff) after administration of 70 mL of MC-CM (300 mgI/mL). The Hounsfield units (HU) of the internal carotid artery T junction, SNR, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), subjective degree of arterial enhancement, image noise, sharpness of the cerebral arterial boundary, and overall diagnostic image quality were compared between the 2 groups.RESULTS: The mean attenuation of the internal carotid artery T junction, SNR, and CNR was significantly higher in the 80 kVp with MC-CM group (379.2, 33.7, and 31.1 HU, respectively) than in the 120 kVp with HC-CM group (282.2, 31.1, and 27.2 HU, respectively). The 80-kVp protocol resulted in significantly higher score in arterial enhancement, sharpness of the cerebral arteries, and overall diagnostic image quality. The effective dose of 80 kVp (0.7 mSv) was 22.2% lower than that of 120 kVp (0.9 mSv).CONCLUSIONS: The use of 80 kVp with MC-CM improved arterial enhancement, SNR, and CNR and provided superior quality images using a smaller amount of iodine and a lower radiation dose than the conventional protocol of 120 kVp with HC-CM.",Excluded,0.10382486

Photobiomodulation using low-level light-emitting diode can be rapidly applied in neurological and physiological disorders safely and noninvasively. Photobiomodulation is effective for chronic diseases because of fewer side effects than drugs. Here we investigated the effects of photobiomodulation using light-emitting diode on amyloid plaques, gliosis, and neuronal loss to prevent and/or recover cognitive impairment, and optimal timing of photobiomodulation initiation for recovering cognitive function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. 5XFAD mice were used as an Alzheimer's disease model. Animals receiving photobiomodulation treatment were divided into two groups: an early group starting photobiomodulation at 2 months of age (5XFAD+Early), and a late group starting photobiomodulation at 6 months of age (5XFAD+Delay). Both groups received photobiomodulation 20 minutes per session three times per week for 14 weeks. The Morris water maze, passive avoidance, and elevated plus maze tests were performed at 10 months of age. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed after behavioral evaluation. The results showed that photobiomodulation treatment at early stages reduced amyloid accumulation, neuronal loss, and microgliosis and alleviated the cognitive dysfunction in 5XFAD mice, possibly by increasing insulin degrading enzyme related to amyloid-beta degradation.

To evaluate the efficacy of hyperfractionated re-irradiation using a three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3-D CRT) technique in patients with locally recurrent carcinoma of the nasopharynx. Four patients with locally recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer were retreated with a hyperfractionated schedule using a 3-D CRT technique. Re-irradiation was delivered in 1.1-1.2 Gy fractions twice per day (BID), with interfraction intervals of more than 6 hours. The total dose ranged from 59.4 to 69.2 Gy. A 3-D CRT technique with 5- or 6-field coplanar and/or non-coplanar beams were employed during the entire treatment procedure. All four patients achieved complete remission of locally recurrent lesions, with marked improvement of subjective symptoms, immediately after re-irradiation. All are alive and well without evidence of disease after limited follow-up periods, which range from 7 to 20 months. So far, there have been no radiation-induced neurologic complications.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) on cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma (CSCH) and to analyze the temporal volume change. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 26 CSCH patients who were treated with GKS between 2001 and 2017. Before GKS, 11 patients (42.3%) had cranial neuropathies and 5 patients (19.2%) complained of headache, whereas 10 patients (38.5%) were initially as-ymptomatic. The mean pre-GKS mass volume was 9.3 mL (range, 0.5-31.6 mL), and the margin dose ranged from 13 to 15 Gy according to the mass volume and the proximity to the optic pathway. All cranial neuropathy patients and half of headache patients showed clinical improvement. All 26 patients achieved mass control; remarkable responses (less than 1/3 of the initial mass vol-ume) were shown in 19 patients (73.1%) and moderate responses (more than 1/3 and less than 2/3) in 7 patients (26.9%). The mean final mass volume after GKS was 1.8 mL (range, 0-12.6 mL). The mean mass volume at 6 months after GKS was 45% (range, 5-80%) compared to the mass volume before GKS and 21% (range, 0-70%) at 12 months. The higher radiation dose tended to in-duce more rapid and greater volume reduction. No treatment-related complication was observed during the follow-up period. GKS could be an effective and safe therapeutic strategy for CSCH. GKS induced very rapid volume reduction compared to other benign brain tumors.

METHOD(S): Twenty-five patients were treated, either immediately after surgery (n = 15) or at the time of radiographic progression or treatment failure (n = 10). SRS was delivered to with a median marginal dose of 22 Gy (range, 16-30) in 1 to 4 fractions (median, 1), targeting a median tumor volume of 5.3 cm (range, 0.3-26.0). RESULT(S): With a median follow-up time of 28 months (range, 3-67), the 12-, 24-, and 36-month actuarial local and regional control rates for all patients were 94%, 94%, 74%, and 90%, 90%, 62%, respectively. There were 2 cases of radiation toxicity. On univariate analysis, the number of recurrences before SRS (P = .046), late SRS (ie, waiting until tumor progression to initiate treatment) (P = .03), and age at treatment >=60 years (P = .01) were significant predictors of recurrence. Of the 20 radiation-naive patients, 2 patients failed with the targeted lesion and 3 elsewhere in the resection bed, resulting in 12-, 24- and 36-month actuarial local and regional control rates of 100%, 100%, 73% and 93%, 93%, 75%, respectively.

Ku70 is a subunit of DNA-protein kinase complex and involved in diverse intranuclear events including the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. Ku70 is rich in the interphase nucleus of cultured cells. In human tissues, however, the distribution of Ku70 has not yet been systematically examined. To characterize the difference of Ku70 distribution between cells of human tissues and cultured cells, the expression of Ku70 was examined in various normal and neoplastic human tissues by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot. In addition, the role of Ku70 in the cellular response against ionizing radiation (IR) was analysed in fibroblasts after exposure to 5 Gy IR and apoptotic indices were examined in Ku70-overexpressed fibroblasts from an ataxia telangiectasia patient and in normal fibroblasts, before and after irradiation. In contrast to cultured cells, Ku70 was not detected in some interphase cells of human tissues and was distributed heterogeneously, even in the same nucleus. Ku70 expression was strikingly low in terminally differentiated cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils, glomerular capillary endothelial cells and fibroblasts, and was absent in spermatids. In spermatocytes, Ku70 was tightly integrated with chromosome filaments, unlike other somatic cells under mitosis. After exposure to IR, Ku70 expression was not increased in ataxia telangiectasia fibroblasts, but was significantly increased in normal fibroblasts. Most of the increased Ku70 was of soluble nuclear protein fraction. Furthermore, overexpression of Ku70 increased radiation resistance both in ataxia telangiectasia fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts.

Sequential, high-resolution, T1-weighted MRI (9.4 Tesla, in-plane resolution: 75 microm, scan time: 45-180 min) with gadolinium (Omniscan; 0.5 ml) injected intraperitoneally revealed a threshold of the BBB opening at 0.67 MPa and BBB closing within 28 h from opening. The contrast-enhancement area and gadolinium deposition path were monitored over time and the influence of vessel density, size and location was determined. Sonicated arteries, or their immediate surroundings, depicted greater contrast enhancement than sonicated homogeneous brain tissue regions. In conclusion, gadolinium was delivered through a transiently opened BBB and contained to a specific brain region (i.e., the hippocampus) using a single-element focused ultrasound transducer. It was also found that the amount of gadolinium deposited in the hippocampal region increased with the acoustic pressure and that the spatial distribution of the BBB opening was determined not only by the ultrasound beam, but also by the vasculature of the targeted brain region.",Excluded,0.103092015

However, it is inevitable that some cancer cells become resistant to radiation. This study is focused on the identification of genes associated with radioresistance in metastatic brain tumor from lung cancer and the functional examination of the selected genes with regards to altered sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation.METHODS: After establishing radioresistant cells from the xenograft model, we explored the significant transcriptional changes by performing DNA microarray profiling. Functional analyses in vitro and in vivo performed to validate the gene responsible for radioresistance.RESULTS: Transcriptional changes induced by radiation therapy are much more extensive in H460 cells than in PC14PE6 cells. The expression levels of TopBP1 and Claspin were increased in the cancer cells that survived radiation therapy. Depletion of TopBP1 or Claspin using shRNA showed an enhancement of sensitivity to radiation in radioresistant lung cancer cells (PC14PE6). Moreover, increased levels of TopBP1 or Claspin endowed cells a higher resistance to radiation. In xenograft models, the knock-down of TopBP1 or Claspin significantly prolonged the median survival time post radiation therapy.CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed the gene expression profiles of the radiosensitive cells and the radioresistant cells to define a set of genes that may be involved in endowing lung cancer cells radioresistance post brain metastasis. Functional analyses indicated that the expression TopBP1 and Claspin positively affects the survival of cancer cells and thus negatively the xenograft metastasis model animals in response to radiation.

After an i.v. injection of a small amount of radioactive probe, PET images are taken based on the decay of shortlived positron-emitting isotopes. The emitted positron collides with a neighboring electron to produce two 511 KeV gamma rays roughly 180 apart. It is based on this physical principal and the positron coincident signals that the point source of the gamma rays can be deduced by using a coincident circuit for detectors 180 apart.

Material(s) and Method(s): Patients of GBM belonging to Radiotherapy Oncology Group Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RTOG RPA) class IV, V and VI were prospectively randomised into study arm (35Gy in 7 fractions over 15 days) and control arm (60Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks). A sample size of 40 with 20 patients in each arm was decided. The changes in Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), Clinical Performance Status (CPS) and Neurological Performance Status (NPS) were noted as an assessment of QOL. Kaplan Meier method was used to analyse the overall survival and progression free survival. Log rank test was used to test the difference between the survival curves. Result(s): The two arms had similar demographic profile. The survival outcomes were identical for patients in the study arm (median survival 7.2 months) and the control arm (median survival 10.4 months) with log rank p=0.09. Freedom from progression was also identical at a median value of 5.5 months vs. 3.8 months, log rank p=0.34. The two arms had no difference in terms of QOL i.e., KPS, CPS and NPS. Conclusion(s): Hypofractionated short course RT is equivalent to standard 6 weeks RT for poor prognosis GBM patients both in terms of survival and QOL.

716,"Obesity: Assessment and prevention: Module 23.2 from Topic 23 ""Nutrition in obesity"". Obesity is one the major health problems of today showing an increasing prevalence among most countries. It is associated with increased risk of several diseases. The importance of early life strategies in the prevention of obesity is well established, whereas, in general, breastfed infants tend to have a lower body mass index (BMI) than formula-fed infants. There seem to be a series of behavioral and hormonal mechanisms that explain this difference. Lifestyle plays a crucial role in the development of overweight and/or obesity and targeted lifestyle modifications have an important impact on preventing obesity. In particular, sedentary behavior (viewing television, playing video games, doing cognitive work, and listening to music) and reduced overall physical activity along with shorter sleep duration promote the overconsumption of dietary macronutrients leading to obesity; at the same time physical activity or exercise in a sufficient dose seems to better facilitate long-term maintenance of new lower body weight. There is enough discussion about a potential effect of nutrients on obesity. Nevertheless, the most the crucial parameter regarding weight loss and prevention of obesity is to achieve a negative energy balance. In regard to specific diet regimes, again energy balance rather that any specific macronutrients composition and/or favoring of low glycemic index products, seems to be have a stronger effect on maintenance of lower weight after 12 months. It has to be noted, that for specific sup groups, obesity or overweight might be showing some favorable trends in survival. In particular, ""obesity paradox"" (OP) refers to an overall prognosis that is no worse and may even be better in some groups than non-obese patients. The OP could be explained by the fact that current classifications of obesity based on BMI may place together, in the same category, subjects with very different clinical and biochemical characteristics.

717,"Pain flare following external beam radiotherapy and meaningful change in pain scores in the treatment of bone metastases. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To examine the incidence of pain flare following external beam radiotherapy and to determine what constitutes a meaningful change in pain scores in the treatment of bone metastases.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with bone metastases treated with external beam radiotherapy were asked to score their pain on a scale of 0-10 before the treatment (baseline), daily during the treatment and for 10 days after completion of external beam radiation. Pain flare was defined as a two-point increase from baseline pain in the pain scale of 0-10 with no decrease in analgesic intake or a 25% increase in analgesic intake employing daily oral morphine equivalent with no decrease in pain score. To distinguish pain flare from progression of pain, we required the pain score and analgesic intake to return back to baseline levels after the increase/flare. They were also asked to indicate if their pain changed during that time compared to pre-treatment level. The change in pain score was compared with patient perception.RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were evaluated in this study. There were 49 male and 39 female patients with the median age of 70 years. Twelve of 88 patients (14%) had pain flare on day 1. The overall incidence of pain flare during the study period ranged from 2 to 16%. A total of 797 pain scorings were obtained. Patients perceived an improvement in pain when their self-reported pain score decreased by at least two points.CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the occurrence of pain flare following the external beam radiotherapy in the treatment of bone metastases. Further studies are required to predict who are at risk for flare. Appropriate measures can be taken to alleviate the pain flare. The finding in the meaningful change in pain scores supports the investigator-defined partial response used in some clinical trials.",Excluded,0.10621929
718,"Dexamethasone in the prophylaxis of radiation-induced pain flare after palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases: a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. BACKGROUND: Pain flare occurs after palliative radiotherapy, and dexamethasone has shown potential for prevention of such flare. We aimed to compare the efficacy of dexamethasone with that of placebo in terms of reduction of incidence of pain flare.METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, patients from 23 Canadian centres were randomly allocated (1:1) with a web-based system and minimisation algorithm to receive either two 4 mg dexamethasone tablets or two placebo tablets taken orally at least 1 h before the start of radiation treatment (a single 8 Gy dose to bone metastases; day 0) and then every day for 4 days after radiotherapy (days 1-4). Patients were eligible if they had a non-haematological malignancy and bone metastasis (or metastases) corresponding to the clinically painful area or areas. Patients reported their worst pain scores and opioid analgesic intake before treatment and daily for 10 days after radiation treatment. They completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life QLQ-C15-PAL, the bone metastases module (EORTC QLQ-BM22), and the Dexamethasone Symptom Questionnaire at baseline, and at days 10 and 42 after radiation treatment. Pain flare was defined as at least a two-point increase on a scale of 0-10 in the worst pain score with no decrease in analgesic intake, or a 25% or greater increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in the worst pain score from days 0-10, followed by a return to baseline levels or below. Primary analysis of incidence of pain flare was by intention-to-treat (patients with missing primary data were classified as having pain flare). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01248585, and is completed.FINDINGS: Between May 30, 2011, and Dec 11, 2014, 298 patients were enrolled. 39 (26%) of 148 patients randomly allocated to the dexamethasone group and 53 (35%) of 150 patients in the placebo group had a pain flare (difference 8.9%, lower 95% confidence bound 0.0, one-sided p=0.05). Two grade 3 and one grade 4 biochemical hyperglycaemic events occurred in the dexamethasone group (without known clinical effects) compared with none in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were bone pain (61 [41%] of 147 vs 68 [48%] of 143), fatigue (58 [39%] of 147 vs 49 [34%] of 143), constipation (47 [32%] of 147 vs 37 [26%] of 143), and nausea (34 [23%] of 147 vs 34 [24%] of 143), most of which were mild grade 1 or 2.INTERPRETATION: Dexamethasone reduces radiation-induced pain flare in the treatment of painful bone metastases.FUNDING: The NCIC CTG's programmatic grant from the Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute.",Excluded,0.106551036

722,"Simultaneous transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation mitigates simulator sickness symptoms in healthy adults: A crossover study. Background: Flight simulators have been used to train pilots to experience and recognize spatial disorientation, a condition in which pilots incorrectly perceive the position, location, and movement of their aircrafts. However, during or after simulator training, simulator sickness (SS) may develop. Spatial disorientation and SS share common symptoms and signs and may involve a similar mechanism of dys-synchronization of neural inputs from the vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive systems. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), a maneuver used for pain control, was found to influence autonomic cardiovascular responses and enhance visuospatial abilities, postural control, and cognitive function. The purpose of present study was to investigate the protective effects of TENS on SS. Method(s): Fifteen healthy young men (age: 28.6 +/- 0.9 years, height: 172.5 +/- 1.4 cm, body weight: 69.3 +/- 1.3 kg, body mass index: 23.4 +/- 1.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participated in this within-subject crossover study. SS was induced by a flight simulator. TENS treatment involved 30 minutes simultaneous electrical stimulation of the posterior neck and the right Zusanli acupoint. Each subject completed 4 sessions (control, SS, TENS, and TENS + SS) in a randomized order. Outcome indicators included SS symptom severity and cognitive function, evaluated with the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and d2 test of attention, respectively. Sleepiness was rated using the Visual Analogue Scales for Sleepiness Symptoms (VAS-SS). Autonomic and stress responses were evaluated by heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and salivary stress biomarkers (salivary alpha-amylase activity and salivary cortisol concentration). Result(s): Simulator exposure increased SS symptoms (SSQ and VAS-SS scores) and decreased the task response speed and concentration. The heart rate, salivary stress biomarker levels, and the sympathetic parameter of HRV increased with simulator exposure, but parasympathetic parameters decreased (p < 0.05). After TENS treatment, SS symptom severity significantly decreased and the subjects were more able to concentrate and made fewer cognitive test errors (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Sympathetic activity increased and parasympathetic activity decreased after simulator exposure. TENS was effective in reducing SS symptoms and alleviating cognitive impairment.Trial registration number: Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register: http://ACTRN12612001172897. © 2013 Chu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded,0.10476172
723,"Radiographic Features of Metastatic Brain Tumors from ALK-rearranged Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: Implications for optimal treatment modalities. Purpose: To investigate the radiological features on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain metastases (BM) from ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated data from 40 eligible patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Radiographic features of metastatic brain tumors, including the number, size, location, and peritumoral brain edema size (PBES), were delineated using MRI. Result(s): 13 patients had metachronous BM (MBM), having developed BM at least 6 months after diagnosis with NSCLC. The remaining patients were categorized as having synchronous BM (SBM). Compared with patients in the SBM group, patients in the MBM group were found to have more favorable values for radiological features including BM number, BM size, and PBES. Ten (76.9%) of the 13 patients with MBM had <=3 lesions and were asymptomatic, and none had developed a diffuse BM pattern, supporting the adoption of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in the majority of these patients and against the administration of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Conversely, among the 27 patients with SBM, 15 (55.6%) patients had >3 lesions and 12 (44.4%) patients were symptomatic, highlighting the necessity of rapidly administrating brain radiotherapy, either as SRS or whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Importantly, only two patients (5.0%) had metastases in the hippocampus and peri-hippocampus region, and both were in the SBM group, indicating the feasibility of hippocampal avoidance WBRT in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Conclusion(s): Both WBRT and SRS are appropriate for the treatment of BM in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC. The incidence of BM in the hippocampus and peri-hippocampus region is low in our radiological data. Nearly 80% of patients with metachronous BM have oligo-metastatic lesions, indicating that SRS is the preferred therapy while PCI is not indicated. Copyright © The author(s).",Excluded,0.10422791
724,"Single-institution experience of high-dose interleukin-2 (HD IL-2) therapy for melanoma patients with stable brain metastases. Our aim was to describe our institution's experience of HD IL-2 therapy in melanoma patients with brain metastases. A retrospective chart review was performed on all melanoma patients with brain metastases treated with HD IL-2 therapy (720 000 IU/ kg per dose intravenously; 14 doses, two cycles per course, maximum two courses) from January 1999 to June 2011 at Saint Louis University. Of 55 patients (5 Stage IVa, 14 Stage IVb, 36 Stage IVc) with metastatic melanoma treated with HD IL-2 at our institution, seven had Stage IVc disease with stable brain metastases at the start of treatment. Two patients had radiosurgery and one patient had whole brain radiation prior to starting HD IL-2 therapy. Three of the four remaining patients received consolidation whole brain radiation after HD IL-2. Median overall survival was 4.7 months (range 1.1- 15.4 months). Four patients died within 4.7 months. The median overall survival for the other three patients was 10.6 months (range 10.4-15.4 months); these three patients received consolidation whole brain radiation after HD IL-2. Despite recent advances, median overall survival for patients with melanoma brain metastases remains 2-3 months. Therapeutic options are limited for these patients and they are typically excluded from clinical trials. Patients with melanoma brain metastases are also usually considered to be ineligible for HD IL-2 therapy. In this analysis, patients underwent HD IL-2 before and after radiosurgery or radiation. While the role of HD IL-2 in melanoma patients with stable brain metastases has yet to be defined, we think it should not be considered a contraindication to initiating therapy.",Excluded,0.10326444
725,"miR-34a in Neurophysiology and Neuropathology. Epigenetic influence of brain and neuronal function plays key regulatory roles in health and diseases. The microRNA miR-34a is a tumor suppressor transcript, and its loss has been prominently linked to various human cancers, including malignancies of the brain. Interestingly, miR-34a is abundantly expressed in the adult mammalian brain, and emerging evidence has implicated its involvement in a range of neurodevelopmental and neuropathological processes. Developmentally, miR-34a regulates neural stem/progenitor cell differentiation and aspects of neurogenesis. During aging, its elevation is connected to hearing loss and age-related macular degeneration. Pathologically, its elevations during epileptic seizures and ischemic stroke contribute to neuronal injury and death. Inhibition or suppression of miR-34a improved neuronal survival against a variety of neurotoxins implicated in Parkinson's disease. Its elevation may also play a role in neuronal demise in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, and suppression of its levels may be generally neuroprotective. The roles and activities of miR-34a in the brain are modulated by factors that control its expression (such as Tp53/73), as well as its downstream target genes (such as the sirtuins SIRT1 and SIRT6) and signaling pathways (such the Notch pathway). We discuss here the known and emerging roles of the miR-34a regulatory network in neurophysiology and neuropathology.

727,"Approaches to sensitizing glioblastoma to radiotherapy: Use of lentiviral vectors. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumour and extirpation followed by radio- and chemotherapy has had minimal impact on the median survival of patients which is still less than one year. Hence, a novel therapeutic modality is required if the survival of patients with this disease is to be improved. ATM, mutated in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), plays a central role in the response to DNA double strand breaks and patients with this disorder are characterised by extreme sensitivity to radiation, increased risk of cancer and neurodegeneration. Thus, ATM represents a potential target for radiosensitization of brain tumour cells. A safe, non-replicating lentivirus is used to abrogate ATM in GBM through the antisense and RNAi approaches for radiosensitization. With either techniques, ATM protein was reduced by >90% and there was a 3-fold sensitization of GBM cells to radiation. ATM protein activation as well as ATM pS1981 foci formation were defective and downstream signalling determined by Ser15 phosphorylation on p53 was reduced.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential utility of botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) bladder injections in patients with radiation cystitis and bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-induced chemical cystitis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, six patients with refractory radiation cystitis were treated with 200 U bladder BoNT-A injections and two patients with refractory cystitis after intravesical BCG therapy were treated with 100 U bladder BoNT-A injections. All the patients were refractory to anticholinergic agents. Under sedation or local anaesthesia, BoNT-A was injected through a cystoscope into 20 sites submucosally in the trigone and floor of the bladder.RESULTS: There were no side-effects or retention after BoNT-A injection. In five of the six patients with radiation cystitis there was a moderate to significant improvement; the mean (sd) bladder capacity increased from 105 (25) mL to 250 (35) mL and the urinary frequency decreased from 14 (2) to 11 (1) episodes per day. In the two patients with BCG cystitis both reported significant symptomatic improvement; the mean (sd) bladder capacity increased from 110 (23) to 230 (23) mL, the urinary frequency decreased from 16 (1) to 12 (1) episodes per day, and using a 10-point visual analogue pain scoring system, the perceived pain score decreased from 8 to 2. Microscopically, the bladder tissue at 1 month after BCG injection showed marked acute and chronic inflammation with eosinophilic infiltration and focal granulomatous formation.

Background: This study aims to investgate the effect of reference dose calculaton grid size (RDCGS) on gamma passing rate (GPR) for patent-specific quality assurance of intensity-modulated radiaton therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 20 patents were retrospectvely selected. Both IMRT and VMAT plans were generated for each patent. Reference dose distributons for gamma analysis were calculated with RDCGS of 1-5 mm at intervals of 1 mm. Dose distributons were measured using MapCHECK2 and ArcCHECK dosimeters. Both global and local gamma analyses with gamma criteria of 3%/3 mm, 2%/3 mm, 2%/2 mm, and 2%/1 mm were performed with various RDCGS. Result(s): As the RDCGS increased from 1 mm to 5 mm, the average global GPRs with 2%/2 mm for VMAT with MapCHECK2 and ArcCHECK decreased by 9.3% and 5.9%, respectvely. The average local GPRs decreased by 14% and 11.7%, respectvely. For IMRT, the global GPRs decreased by 4.8% and 6%, respectvely, whereas the local GPRs decreased by 10.5% and 8.6%, respectvely. The effect of the RDCGS on the GPRs became larger when performing local gamma analysis as well as when applying small distance-to-agreement (DTA). As the RDCGS increased, the average changes in the GPR per mm of DTA change increased regardless of the type of radiotherapy, detector, or gamma analysis. Conclusion(s): For an accurate verificaton of the IMRT and VMAT plans, it is recommended that the reference dose distributon must be calculated with the smallest possible RDCGS.

OBJECTIVES: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumour in adults. Surgery and radiotherapy constitute the cornerstones for the therapeutic management of GBM. The standard treatment today is maximal surgical resection followed by concomitant chemo-radiation therapy followed by adjuvant TMZ according to Stupp protocol. Despite the progress in neurosurgery, radiotherapy and oncology, the prognosis still results poor. In order to reduce the long time of standard treatment, maintaining or improving the clinical results, in our institute we have investigated the effects of hypo-fractionated radiation therapy for patients with GBM.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients affected by GBM who had previously undergone surgical resection (total, subtotal or biopsy) were enrolled between October 2005 and December 2011 in a single institutional study of hypo-fractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) followed or not by adjuvant chemotherapy with TMZ (6-12 cycles). The most important eligibility criteria were: biopsy-proven GBM, KPS >= 60, age >= 18 years, no previous brain irradiation, informed consensus. Hypo-fractionated IMRT was delivered to a total dose of 25 Gy in 5 fractions prescribed to 70% isodose. Response to treatment, OS, PFS, toxicity and patterns of recurrence were evaluated, and sex, age, type of surgery, Karnofsky performance status, Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) classification, time between surgery and initiation of radiotherapy were evaluated as potential prognostic factors for survival.RESULTS: All patients have completed the treatment protocol. Median age was 64.5 years (range 41-82 years) with 31 females (46%) and 36 males (54%). Median KPS at time of treatment was 80. The surgery was gross total in 38 patients and subtotal in 14 patients; 15 patients underwent only biopsy. No grade 3-4 acute or late neurotoxicity was observed. With median follow-up of 14.9 months, the median OS and PFS were 13.4 and 7.9 months, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The hypo-fractionated radiation therapy can be used for patients with GBM, resulting in favourable overall survival, low rates of toxicity and satisfying QoL.

Many agents have been used for neuroprotection. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible protective role of royal jelly on radiationinduced brain damage. Design(s): In the present study, thirty-two adult male Dawley rats, 8-12 weeks of age and weighing 275+/-35 grams were randomly divided into four groups each group compressed eight animals: group 1: control (C), group 2: irradiated rats (RT), group 3: irradiated rats with oral royal jelly 50 mg/kg per day for 7 days (RT+RJ50), group 4: oral royal jelly 50 mg/kg per day for 7 day (RJ50). Sprague Dawley rats were irradiated with 22 Gy gamma radiation delivered to total cranium. Royal jelly was administered before and after irradiation per day for 7 days. At the seventh day of study, when rats were under ketamine anesthesia samples of brain tissues were taken and biochemical and microscopic examination after sacrification. Result(s): An increase in brain tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations (P<0.001) were detected while significant decreases in catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities (P<0.001) in irradiation alone group when compared to control group. Increases in MDA were relatively well prevented by royal jelly. The administration of RJ increased to activity of SOD and CAT enzymes and decreased MDA level in the brain tissue (p<0.001). On histopathological examination, royal jelly reduced edema, necrosis, vasodilation and neuronal degeneration. Conclusion(s): The results obtained from this study demonstrated that with royal jelly prevented the damage that develops in brain following irradiation. The beneficial effect of royal jelly can be related to protection of the brain from oxidative injury.",Included,0.9239864
740,"The Radio-protective effects of Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester and Thymoquinone in rats exposed to total head irradiation. Background: Many cancer patients treated with radiotherapy suffer severe side effects during and after their treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of irradiation and the addition of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and thymoquinone (TQ) on the oxidant/antioxidant system in the liver tissue of irradiated rats. Methods: A total of 40 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups to test the radioprotective effectiveness of thymoquinone and caffeic acid phenethyl ester administered by intraperitoneal injection. Appropriate control groups were also studied. Results: While liver tissue total oxidant status, lipid hydroperoxide level, and oxidative stress index were significantly increased in the irradiated (IR) group, compared with other groups, total antioxidant status, sulfhydryl levels, and paraoxonase (PON) activity were significantly decreased. Ceruloplasmin activity in IR plus TQ and IR groups was higher than the control group. Arylesterase and PON activities in IR plus TQ- and IR plus CAPE-supplemented groups were lower than those of control groups. Conclusions: TQ and CAPE decrease oxidative stress markers and have antioxidant effects, which also augment antioxidant capacity in the liver tissue of irradiated rats.

741,"The radiation therapy options of intracranial hemangiopericytoma: An overview and update on a rare vascular mesenchymal tumor. Hemangiopericytoma (HPC) is an extremely rare hypervascu-lar tumor of mesenchymal lineage. It tends to recur and to develop distant metastases even many years after primary surgical resection. The management of recurrent and metastatic disease is not always so well defined. A complete surgical resection does not eliminate the high risk of local recurrences that occur in the central nervous system, often in the same surgical bed. However, treatment with adjuvant radiotherapy even in cases of complete resection remains controversial. Because of its rarity, there is no standard for treatment. We focused on radiotherapy treatment options, analyzing the literature and making a base on conduct further studies to establish the standard radiation dose to be used for locoregional control of such a complex and extremely rare disease and to help specialists to take the most appropriate therapeutic option. © Copyright M.P,Ciliberti et al., 2018.",Excluded,0.104319565
742,"Characteristics of diarrhoea in 10 008 users of lansoprazole in daily practice: Which co-factors contribute?. Purpose. Diarrhoea is one of the most frequently reported adverse events during proton pump inhibitor use in any setting. Because of the limited available information, this study was set up with the aim of assessing the incidence and characteristics of diarrhoea and to investigate possible associated co-factors in proton pump inhibitor users in daily practice. Methods. Data were used from a prospective, observational study in which 10 008 lansprazole users were followed over time (1994-1998). The study was designed according to the SAMM guidelines. A nested case-control design was used to compare proton pump inhibitor users reporting diarrhoea with those reporting no diarrhoea. Results. The frequency of diarrhoea was 3.7% and the incidence density 10.7 per 1000 patient months of proton pump inhibitor use. The diarrhoea was most commonly loose and occurred on average 4.4 times per day. The analysis of co-factors revealed that patients with concomitant use of oral antibiotics and patients reporting neurological and/or dermatological adverse events, were at risk of developing diarrhoea during proton pomp inhibitor use. Conclusions. In conclusion, diarrhoea was as frequently reported in our study as in clinical trials and observational data of lansoprazole users. We found the concomitant use of oral antibiotics and the reporting of certain other adverse events to be associated with the reporting of diarrhoea during lansoprazole use. Although a relationship with the proton pump inhibitor intake seemed very plausible, we recommend that use of concomitant medicines as a cause of diarrhoea must be taken into consideration in lansoprazole users.

743,"Environmental and occupational causes of cancer: new evidence 2005-2007. What do we currently know about the occupational and environmental causes of cancer? As of 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified 415 known or suspected carcinogens. Cancer arises through an extremely complicated web of multiple causes, and we will likely never know the full range of agents or combinations of agents. We do know that preventing exposure to individual carcinogens prevents the disease. Declines in cancer rates-such as the drop in male lung cancer cases from the reduction in tobacco smoking or the drop in bladder cancer among cohorts of dye workers from the elimination of exposure to specific aromatic amines-provides evidence that preventing cancer is possible when we act on what we know. Although the overall age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in the United States among both men and women have declined in the last decade, the rates of several types of cancers are on the rise; some of which are linked to environmental and occupational exposures. This report chronicles the most recent epidemiologic evidence linking occupational and environmental exposures with cancer. Peer-reviewed scientific studies published from January 2005 to June 2007 were reviewed, supplementing our state-of-the-evidence report published in September 2005. Despite weaknesses in certain individual studies, we consider the evidence linking the increased risk of several types of cancer with specific exposures somewhat strengthened by recent publications, among them brain cancer from exposure to non-ionizing radiation, particularly radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile telephones; breast cancer from exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) before puberty; leukemia from exposure to 1,3-butadiene; lung cancer from exposure to air pollution; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) from exposure to pesticides and solvents; and prostate cancer from exposure to pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metal working fluids or mineral oils. In addition to NHL and prostate cancer, early findings from the National Institutes of Health Agricultural Health Study suggest that several additional cancers may be linked to a variety of pesticides. Our report also briefly describes the toxicological evidence related to the carcinogenic effect of specific chemicals and mechanisms that are difficult to study in humans, namely exposures to bis-phenol A and epigenetic, trans-generational effects. To underscore the multi-factorial, multi-stage nature of cancer, we also present a technical description of cancer causation summarizing current knowledge in molecular biology. We argue for a new cancer prevention paradigm, one based on an understanding that cancer is ultimately caused by multiple interacting factors rather than a paradigm based on dubious attributable fractions. This new cancer prevention paradigm demands that we limit exposure to avoidable environmental and occupational carcinogens, in combination with additional important risk factors like diet and lifestyle. The research literature related to environmental and occupational causes of cancer is constantly growing, and future updates will be carried out in light of new biological understanding of the mechanisms and new methods for studying exposures in human populations. The current state of knowledge is sufficient to compel us to act on what we know.

This study compares static conformal field (CF), intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and dynamic arcs (DA) for the stereotactic radiotherapy of base-of-skull meningiomas. Twenty-one cases of base-of-skull meningioma (median planning target volume [PTV] = 21.3 cm3) previously treated with stereotactic radiotherapy were replanned with each technique. The plans were compared for Radiation Therapy Oncology Group conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI), and doses to normal structures at 6 dose values from 50.4 Gy to 5.6 Gy. The mean CI was 1.75 (CF), 1.75 (DA), and 1.66 (IMRT) (p < 0.05 when comparing IMRT to either CF or DA plans). The CI (IMRT) was inversely proportional to the size of the PTV (Spearman's rho = -0.53, p = 0.01) and at PTV sizes above 25 cm3, the CI (IMRT) was always superior to CI (DA) and CI (CF). At PTV sizes below 25 cm3, there was no significant difference in CI between each technique. There was no significant difference in HI between plans. The total volume of normal tissue receiving 50.4, 44.8, and 5.6 Gy was significantly lower when comparing IMRT to CF and DA plans (p < 0.05). There was significantly improved dose sparing for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe with IMRT but no significant difference for the optic chiasm or pituitary gland. These results demonstrate that stereotactic IMRT should be considered to treat base-of-skull meningiomas with a PTV larger than 25 cm3, due to improved conformity and normal tissue sparing, in particular for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe.",Excluded,0.12456532

Objectives: Open radical hysterectomy (RH) followed by adjuvant radiation (XRT) for cervical cancer has been associated with high morbidity; however, RHs are now often performed robotically. We examined if the robotic platform decreases the morbidity associated with radical surgery followed by adjuvant XRT. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study of patients with cervical cancer undergoing RH from 1995-2013 was performed. Clinical and pathologic data were obtained from the medical record. Long-term (LT) complications were defined as urinary and/or bowel complications, and lymphedema presenting more than 30 days after completion of therapy. Complications were graded. Grade 1 was mild symptoms and easily treated. Grade 2 was symptoms resolving with long-term medical therapy. Grade 3 was major symptoms requiring surgery or invasive procedures. The X<sup>2</sup> and student t tests were used for analysis. Result(s): Overall, 243 patients underwent RH for cervical cancer. The open surgical approach was used in 43% (n = 104) and the robotic approach was used in 57% (n = 139). Eighty-three patients (34.2%) required adjuvant XRT. XRT was associated with increased risk of LT complication (28.9% vs 7.0% P <.001). LT complications included lymphedema (n = 18), bowel-associated complications (enteritis/proctitis n = 8, obstruction n = 2), and urinary complications (hemorrhagic cystitis n = 1, neurogenic bladder n = 2, fistula n = 1, and ureteral stricture n = 3). Among patients who received adjuvant XRT, the open surgical approach was used in 48% (n = 40) and the robotic approach in 52% (n = 43). There was no difference in time to initiation of XRT between the 2 surgical groups (43.2 +/- 15.6 vs 47.3 +/- 19.6 days, P =.33). There was no difference in grade 2/3 LT complications in patients receiving adjuvant XRT between the groups (27.5% vs 27.9%, P =.97). However, patients undergoing open surgery experienced a trend toward increased adhesion-related complications, such as bowel obstruction and ureteral stricture (10% vs 2.3%, P =.19). Conclusion(s): We found no difference in LT complications between patients who underwent robotic and those who underwent open RH and adjuvant XRT. Fewer adhesion-related LT complications may be seen with robotic surgery. However, because many XRT-related complications occur at later time points, continued follow-up is needed to evaluate for potential differences between the 2 groups.",Included,0.24194498

The rationale of our study was to examine the efficacy and safety of stereotactic intracavitary instillation of <sup>90</sup>yttrium colloid for the primary treatment of cystic tumors. Method(s): As part of a Health Canada approved clinical trial, we have enrolled nine patients (6 females, 3 males; mean age 64, range 43 to 83 years) for treatment of symptomatic and/or enlarging cysts.

749,ATM induction insufficiency in a radiosensitive breast-cancer patient. The ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) gene (ATM) is a dominant breast cancer gene with tumour suppressor activity. ATM also regulates cellular sensitivity to ionising radiation (IR) presumably through its role as a facilitator of DNA repair. In normal cells and tissues the ATM protein is rapidly induced by IR to threshold/maximum levels. The kinase function of the ATM protein is also rapidly activated in response to IR. The fact that women carriers of ATM mutations can have an increased risk of developing breast cancer and that many sporadic breast tumours have reduced levels of the ATM protein broadens the scope of ATM's tumour suppressor within the breast. This report describes the downregulation of ATM protein levels in a radiosensitive breast cancer patient. Postinduction ATM levels were up to tenfold lower in the patient's fresh tissues compared to normal controls. These results might indicate a much broader role for ATM anomalies in breast cancer aetiology.,Excluded,0.31362087

752,"Paired associative stimulation. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) refers to a paradigm consisting of slow-rate repetitive low-frequency median nerve stimulation combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the contralateral motor cortex. This protocol has been shown to induce plastic changes of excitability in the human motor cortex. Its principles of design were shaped after associative long-term potentiation (LTP) in experimental animals, a cellular mechanism likely to be relevant for learning and memory. PAS-induced changes of cortical excitability share a number of physiological properties with LTP. Of particular importance is the fact that the sign of PAS-induced changes of the size of amplitudes of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) depends on the exact interval between the afferent and the magnetic pulse during the intervention. A number of observations suggest that PAS-induced excitability changes may have functional significance. PAS-induced plasticity may contribute to elucidating the pathogenesis of neurological disorders where neuroplasticity is thought to have a pathogenetic role. Finally, PAS-induced plasticity may itself have therapeutic potential. [References: 16]",Excluded,0.104406364

STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor Ramipril, as a mitigator of radiation-induced spinal cord injury.SETTING: Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.METHODS: Total of 22 rats were irradiated with single doses of 23.6-33 Gy at the C4-T2 spinal levels. After irradiation, the rats were randomized to the radiation only control group and the Ramipril-treated (radiation + Ramipril) experimental group. Ramipril 1.5 mg/kg/day was given in the drinking water starting 1 week after radiation through the study duration.RESULTS: All the rats irradiated with 28.5-33 Gy became paralyzed at 125 +/- 4 days, whereas no rats became paralyzed after 23.6 Gy. The time to develop paralysis was delayed to 135 +/- 4 days in Ramipril-treated group (P < 0.001). H&E and LFB showed microscopic structural restoration and remyelination with Ramipril treatment. VEGF expression was increased in the irradiated spinal cord, and the number of VEGF-positive cells was significantly decreased by Ramipril treatment (P < 0.001). Immunohistochemical stain with Iba-1 showed increased microglial infiltration in the irradiated spinal cords. The number of Iba-1-positive microglia was significantly reduced by Ramipril treatment (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Ramipril reduced the rate of paralysis even at the paralysis-inducing radiation doses. It also significantly delayed the onset of paralysis. Neuroinflammation and endothelial cell damage may be the key mediators of radiation injury.

The efficacy of combining radiation therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitor blockade to treat brain tumors is currently the subject of multiple investigations and holds significant therapeutic promise. However, the long-term effects of this combination therapy on the normal brain tissue are unknown. Here, we examined mice that were intracranially implanted with murine glioma cell line and became long-term survivors after treatment with a combination of 10 Gy cranial irradiation (RT) and anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade (aPD-1). Post-mortem analysis of the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to tumor implantation showed complete abolishment of hippocampal neurogenesis, but neural stem cells were well preserved in subventricular zone. In addition, we observed a drastic reduction in the number of mature oligodendrocytes in the subcortical white matter. Importantly, this observation was evident specifically in the combined (RT+aPD-1) treatment group but not in the single treatment arm of either RT alone or aPD-1 alone. Elimination of microglia with a small molecule inhibitor of colony stimulated factor-1 receptor (PLX5622) prevented the loss of mature oligodendrocytes.

756,"Progressive reduction of its expression in rods reveals two pools of arrestin-1 in the outer segment with different roles in photoresponse recovery. Light-induced rhodopsin signaling is turned off with sub-second kinetics by rhodopsin phosphorylation followed by arrestin-1 binding. To test the availability of the arrestin-1 pool in dark-adapted outer segment (OS) for rhodopsin shutoff, we measured photoresponse recovery rates of mice with arrestin-1 content in the OS of 2.5%, 5%, 60%, and 100% of wild type (WT) level by two-flash ERG with the first (desensitizing) flash at 160, 400, 1000, and 2500 photons/rod. The time of half recovery (t(half)) in WT retinas increases with the intensity of the initial flash, becoming ~2.5-fold longer upon activation of 2500 than after 160 rhodopsins/rod. Mice with 60% and even 5% of WT arrestin-1 level recovered at WT rates. In contrast, the mice with 2.5% of WT arrestin-1 had a dramatically slower recovery than the other three lines, with the t(half) increasing ~28 fold between 160 and 2500 rhodopsins/rod. Even after the dimmest flash, the rate of recovery of rods with 2.5% of normal arrestin-1 was two times slower than in other lines, indicating that arrestin-1 level in the OS between 100% and 5% of WT is sufficient for rapid recovery, whereas with lower arrestin-1 the rate of recovery dramatically decreases with increased light intensity. Thus, the OS has two distinct pools of arrestin-1: cytoplasmic and a separate pool comprising ~2.5% that is not immediately available for rhodopsin quenching. The observed delay suggests that this pool is localized at the periphery, so that its diffusion across the OS rate-limits the recovery. The line with very low arrestin-1 expression is the first where rhodopsin inactivation was made rate-limiting by arrestin manipulation.",Excluded,0.10241338

BACKGROUND: Cervical pedicle screws are advantageous in their biomechanical stability within cervical and cervicothoracic constructs. The seventh cervical vertebra contains relatively large pedicles and has a low incidence of vertebral artery localization within the transverse foramina. The freehand technique of pedicle screw insertion is advantageous in decreasing intraoperative radiation exposure both to the patient and surgeon. In this study, we investigated the safety and accuracy of C7 pedicle screw placement at our institution utilizing an anatomic freehand technique.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective study was performed, and 20 patients were identified who met the inclusion criteria over a five-year period (2013-2018). The C7 pedicle screw placement capability and accuracy were recorded. Accuracy was graded based upon postoperative imaging on a Grade 0-3 scale for breach assessment. Any neurologic complications related to screw placement were also recorded.RESULTS: Successful pedicle screw placement occurred in 90% of attempts (36/40). The overall screw accuracy rate was 89% (32/36). There were four minor breaches (Grade 1) identified on CT, without neurologic complications. The fusion rate in our cohort for patients with follow up greater than eight months was 100%.CONCLUSIONS: In our patient series, the freehand technique of C7 pedicle screw placement utilizing a small laminotomy with direct pedicle palpation appears to be a safe and accurate method for screw placement, and provides adequate biomechanical stability for cervical and cervicothoracic construct fusion.",Excluded,0.10284072

761,"Lymphopoiesis in the chicken pineal gland. Pineal lymphoid development was studied in two breeds of chickens from hatching until sexual maturity. No lymphocytes were found in the pineal prior to 9 days of age (da). Lymphocytes migrate through the endothelium of venules into the pineal stroma. Lymphoid tissue reached its maximal accumulation in 32-da pineal glands of both breeds. At this age, the New Hampshire (NH) breed had a larger proportion of lymphoid volume to total pineal volume (32%) than did pineal glands from White Leghorn (WL) chickens (18%). Averaged over the period 23 to 62 da, NH chickens (a heavy breed) had a lymphoid volume (0.753 mm 3) that was about three times greater (P less than 0.05) than that of the lighter WL breed (0.251 mm 3). Lymphocytes are able to enter cerebrospinal fluid form lymphoid accumulations (LA) embedded in the choroid plexus by migrating between choroid ependymal cells. The 122-da chickens typically lacked lymphoid tissue in the pineal gland with the exception of occasional LA contained in capsular tissue. Surgical bursectomy, thymectomy, or their combination at hatching followed with whole-body irradiation (IR) at 24 hours postsurgery inhibited the initial influx of lymphocytes usually seen in 9-da pineal glands. Also, these treatments prevented formation of germinal centers normally found in the pineal at 3 and 5 weeks and reduced total pineal volume at each age examined. However, pineal lymphoid volume of the surgical-IR group did not differ from control-IR chickens at either 3 or 5 weeks. Pineal glands from birds made agammaglobulinemic (bursa-cell depleted) by cyclophosphamide treatment in ovo were devoid of germinal centers, although thin strands of lymphocytes were usually found along venous sinuses. These dissociation studies suggest that the normal expression of lymphoid tissue in the chicken pineal gland is dependent on the bursa and thymus. Furthermore, these observations indicate that the pineal gland should be considered a functional component of the chicken's lymphomyeloid complex.",Excluded,0.22054066

Because training in this task requires animals to be food-deprived, we compared the trained animals with similarly food-deprived untrained animals and normal controls.

However, stress-related effects produced by food deprivation and handling significantly enhanced the expression of long-term depression in these pathways. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that the acquisition of a complex motor skill produces bi-directional changes in synaptic strength that are distributed throughout the complex neural networks of motor cortex, which remains synaptically balanced during learning. The results are incompatible with the idea that learning causes large unidirectional changes in the population response of these neural networks, which may occur instead during certain behavioral states, such as stress.",Excluded,0.107321344
767,"The effect of bleomycin on DNA synthesis in ataxia telangiectasia lymphoid cells. Bleomycin, a radiomimetic glycopeptide, inhibits de novo DNA synthesis in ataxia telangiectasia lymphoblastoid B cells to a markedly lesser extent than in normal and xeroderma pigmentosum lymphoid cells. This observation is similar to that following ionizing radiation; however, the effect is slower following the chemical treatment. Recovery of the normal cells occurs 15-18 hours after treatment, whereas the ataxia telangiectasia lines do not attain normal levels of DNA synthesis during the entire 24-hour observation period. Similar differences were not observed following treatment with mitomycin C, a bifunctional alkylating agent, indicating a specific effect of bleomycin on DNA synthesis in ataxia telangiectasia cells. Following bleomycin treatment and preincubation with hydroxyurea, residual DNA synthesis in ataxia telangiectasia cells was similar to that in both normal and xeroderma pigmentosum lymphoid cells, suggesting that the capacity to repair the induced DNA lesion is present.",Excluded,0.90517586
768,"Diagnosis and treatment of salivary gland disorders. The keystone of the architecture of the oral cavity is saliva; however, it is rarely acknowledged as a vital physiologic secretion. Saliva plays three major roles in oral and systemic health. It provides host protection, assists in the initiation of food and fluid intake, and enables communication through speech. Without adequate salivary output augmented by a rich assortment of salivary proteins and electrolytes, oral and pharyngeal health declines as well as a person's quality of life. This article will provide a brief summary of the function of saliva, oral and systemic etiologies of salivary dysfunction, and methods to treat and prevent salivary disorders. Oral health care professionals can play a vital role in identifying patients at risk for developing salivary dysfunction and should provide appropriate preventive and interventive techniques that will help preserve oral health and function.

769,"Radiation exposure of patients in comprehensive computed tomography of the head in acute stroke. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess patient radiation exposure in comprehensive stroke imaging using multidetector row CT (MDCT) combining standard CT of the head, cerebral perfusion (CTP), and CT angiography (CTA) studies. METHOD(S): Examination protocols for CT and CTA of cerebral and cervical vessels, as well as CTP were simulated using a Somatom Sensation Cardiac 64. Effective doses were derived from measurements with the use of lithium-fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters (LiF-TLD) at several organ sites using an Alderson-Rando phantom. RESULT(S): LiF-TLD measurements resulted in effective doses of 1.7 mSv for CT, 1.9 mSv for CTA of intracranial vessels, and 2.8 mSv for CTA of cervical vessels, respectively. Depending on examination parameters, effective doses varied between 1.1 and 5.0 mSv for cerebral CTP. For CTP, local doses in the area of the primary beam ranged between 114 and 444 mGy. CONCLUSION(S): Comprehensive stroke imaging may result in up to 9.5 mSv with possible local doses of 490 mGy. Although critical doses for organ damage (eg, cataract formation or hair loss) are not reached, physicians need to be aware of possible radiation induced sequelae particularly in repetitive examinations.",Excluded,0.10458742

The localisation of the radioiodinated Fab fragment of monoclonal antibody (Mab) 81C6, reactive with a glioma-associated extracellular matrix antigen, was studied in athymic mice bearing subcutaneous and intracranial xenografts of D-54 MG glioma cells. In vitro 81C6 Fab showed a marked loss of immunoreactivity and affinity for antigen compared to intact Mab 81C6.

BACKGROUND: Flow diversion is an effective and increasingly accepted method for endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms. Additionally, the public has heightened concerns regarding radiation exposure from medical procedures. This study analyzes radiation dose and fluoroscopy time during treatment of large and giant proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms with the pipeline embolization device (PED) versus traditional coiling techniques.METHODS: Radiation dose, fluoroscopy time, and contrast dye administration were retrospectively analyzed in 55 patients undergoing endovascular treatment of aneurysms >= 10 mm from petrous to superior hypophyseal ICA segments. Patients were treated by either PED (37 patients) or traditional coiling techniques (18 patients). Aortic arch type and proximal ICA tortuosity were also assessed as markers of access difficulty.RESULTS: Average radiation dose with PED treatment was 2840 +/- 213 mGy and 4010 +/- 708 mGy with traditional coiling techniques (p=0.048; 29% decrease with PED). Mean fluoroscopy time for PED was 56.1 +/- 5.0 min and 85.9 +/- 11.9 min for coiling cases (p=0.0087; 35% decrease with PED). These benefits existed despite more difficult arch anatomy and a trend towards greater proximal vessel tortuosity in PED cases. Contrast dye amounts were also reduced by 37.5% in PED cases (75 +/- 6 mL) versus coiling cases (120 +/- 13 mL, p=0.0008).CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of large and giant proximal ICA aneurysms using PED requires less radiation, less fluoroscopy time, and less contrast administration than standard coiling techniques. This further demonstrates the benefits of flow diversion for treatment of these aneurysms.",Excluded,0.10808427
772,"A role for oligodendrocytes in the stabilization of optic axon numbers. Differentiated oligodendrocytes express neurite growth inhibitory proteins at a time when these cells are involved in the myelination of recently formed fiber pathways. As the process of myelination follows the completion of neurite outgrowth and is concurrent with the stabilization of fiber numbers in a pathway, we set out to determine whether myelination and fiber tract stability could be causally related. Myelin formation was prevented in the rat retinofugal pathway by x-irradiating the optic nerves during oligodendrocyte proliferation. Electron microscopic and immunohistochemical analysis of irradiated optic nerves at P15 showed that oligodendrocytes and myelin were virtually absent. Optic fiber numbers were determined at 2 weeks of age throughout the length of normal and x-irradiated nerves. In some cases, normal or irradiation-treated pups were intraocularly injected with FGF 5 d prior to the fiber count in order to promote neurite outgrowth. Axon counts showed that the total fiber number in a myelin-free optic nerve was 10-30% higher than that of a myelinated nerve. Further, fiber numbers fluctuated by as much as 20% along the length of a myelin-free nerve but were relatively constant throughout the length of a myelinated nerve. Treatment of myelinated nerves with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) had no effect on either total fiber numbers or fiber number fluctuation. Conversely, fiber numbers in myelin-free/FGF-treated optic nerves were as much as 40% higher than in normals. Furthermore, total fiber numbers along the length of these nerves fluctuated by up to 34%. These results indicate that, in the absence of myelination, optic fibers are able to form sprouts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded,0.92270124

774,"Chemical basis of reactive oxygen species reactivity and involvement in neurodegenerative diseases. Increasing numbers of individuals suffer from neurodegenerative diseases, which are characterized by progressive loss of neurons. Oxidative stress, in particular, the overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), play an important role in the development of these diseases, as evidenced by the detection of products of lipid, protein and DNA oxidation in vivo. Even if they participate in cell signaling and metabolism regulation, ROS are also formidable weapons against most of the biological materials because of their intrinsic nature. By nature too, neurons are particularly sensitive to oxidation because of their high polyunsaturated fatty acid content, weak antioxidant defense and high oxygen consumption. Thus, the overproduction of ROS in neurons appears as particularly deleterious and the mechanisms involved in oxidative degradation of biomolecules are numerous and complexes. This review highlights the production and regulation of ROS, their chemical properties, both from kinetic and thermodynamic points of view, the links between them, and their implication in neurodegenerative diseases.

The comet assay is widely used in human biomonitoring to measure DNA damage as a marker of exposure to genotoxic agents or to investigate genoprotective effects. Studies often involve small numbers of subjects, and design may be sub-optimal in other respects. In addition, comet assay protocols in use in different laboratories vary significantly. In spite of these difficulties, it is appropriate to carry out a pooled analysis of all available comet assay biomonitoring data, in order to establish baseline parameters of DNA damage, and to investigate associations between comet assay measurements and factors such as sex, age, smoking status, nutrition, lifestyle, etc. With this as its major objective, the ComNet project has recruited almost 100 research groups willing to share datasets. Here we provide a background to this project, discussing the history of the comet assay and practical issues that can critically affect its performance.

778,"Clinical controversies: proton radiation therapy for brain and skull base tumors. Proton radiotherapy offers distinct physical properties that could lead to an improvement of dose distribution with subsequent reduction of integral dose to the patient. This supports the potential use of proton beams in tumors close to sensitive structures, such as the skull base and the brain. In the present manuscript, the literature on proton therapy for brain and skull base tumors is critically reviewed and compared with results obtained with modern photon techniques. Treatment planning comparisons demonstrate that dose distributions within the target are comparable. In terms of normal tissue dose distribution, protons offer an advantage in the intermediate- and low-dose regions, and this may result in long-term clinical benefit, although to date no randomized or long-term follow-up data demonstrate this. Considering the excellent long-term results seen with photons in localized tumors, this benefit may be modest and difficult to demonstrate. Protons may allow for safe delivery of higher local doses with the potential to improve local control in some tumors. However, improvements in photon techniques also enable safe dose escalation, and therefore, the comparison of the techniques of delivery is likely to need randomized trials. Proton therapy offers effective treatment for a range of brain tumors. However, the limited availability, the cost, and the lack of evidence of superiority mean that advanced photon radiotherapy continues to be the treatment of choice. It is hoped that advances in technology, both in proton and photon radiotherapy delivery, and increasing information on the efficacy and toxicity of the two modalities will lead to further improvement in radiotherapy approaches and provide the basis for the best choice of treatment for the individual patient.",Excluded,0.1058588

PURPOSE: To retrospectively analyze the outcomes and benefits from radiation therapy (RT) as a component of multimodal treatment for oligodendroglioma and oligoastrocytoma, assessing local control and survival rates and evaluating prognostic factors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed 56 adult patients with supratentorial oligodendroglioma or oligoastrocytoma treated at our institution from January 1990 to December 2003 with fractionated stereotactic RT (FSRT).RESULTS: Fractionated stereotactic RT was well tolerated in all patients, without side effects. Median survival and progression-free survival calculated from the initiation of radiotherapy were 48 months (range, 2-133 months) and 38 months (range, 2-132 months), respectively. Progression-free survival rates after radiation were 89% at 1 year and 52% at 5 years. Of 26 recurrences, 92% developed in field. With regard to histology, overall survival rates in the World Health Organization (WHO) Grade II group were 89% and 74% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. In patients with WHO Grade III tumors, overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 69% and 46%, respectively. No prognosticators could be identified for median survival and progression-free survival after radiotherapy. Median overall survival calculated from primary diagnosis was 77.5 months (range, 3-214 months). The Cox regression multivariate analysis for age and neurologic symptoms showed a significance of p = 0.003 for age and p = 0.037 for the presence of neurologic symptoms on overall survival since primary diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: Commonly, conventional conformal RT is applied in the treatment of brain tumors. In FSRT, the tumor volume can be irradiated with high doses, sparing volume of normal brain tissue. Our data are in accordance with survival times found in the literature. Ninety-two percent of all recurrences occurred within the defined target volume, confirming that reduction of the RT portals by the use of FSRT does not lead to an increased rate of recurrences at the field border or out of field. Fractionated stereotactic RT can therefore be implemented as an effective and safe modality in the therapy of primary oligodendroglioma and oligoastrocytoma.",Excluded,0.15542573

This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of intracoronary radiation therapy (ICRT) after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for preventing restenosis in human coronary arteries.METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (22 arteries) with unstable angina underwent standard balloon angioplasty. ICRT was performed with the use of an 192Ir source wire that was hand delivered to the angioplasty site. Angiographic follow-up was performed at 24 hours, between 30 and 60 days, and at 6 months. Angioplasty was successful in 19 of 22 lesions, and insertion of the radioactive source wire was successful at all treated sites. Angiographic study at 24 hours demonstrated early late loss of the luminal diameter from 1.92+/-0.55 to 1.40+/-0.27 mm. Between 30 and 60 days, repeat angiography demonstrated total occlusion in 2 arteries, a new pseudoaneurysm in 1 artery, and significant dilatation at the treatment site in 2 additional vessels. At > or = 6 months' follow-up, all remaining arteries (n=20) maintained patent, with a mean lumen diameter of 1.65+/-0.8 mm. The calculated late lumen loss was 0.27+/-0.56 mm, and the late loss index was 0.19. Clinical events at 1 year included myocardial infarction in 1 patient, repeat angioplasty to the treated site in 3 patients, and persistent angina in 7 patients.CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results demonstrate that ICRT after coronary intervention is feasible and is associated with an acceptable degree of complications and lower rates of angiographic restenosis indexes.",Excluded,0.9058174
781,"Paraventricular hypothalamic influences on spinal nociceptive processing. Oxytocin properties have been studied in different experimental models in order to obtain evidence for its analgesic properties. The analgesic effect of an oxytocinergic pathway descending from the hypothalamus reaching the dorsal horn of the spinal cord has been studied. In anesthetized rats, we recorded single units at the L4-L5 spinal dorsal horn level and stimulated the peripheral receptive field. The evoked responses were classified according to their latencies in A-beta, A-delta, C fibers, and postdischarge. We used these responses to evaluate the effects of electrical stimulation of the paraventricular nucleus (PV) of the hypothalamus. We observed a selective blockage of A-delta and C fibers related to the duration of the train stimulus duration. Similar effects were observed when oxytocin (OT) was applied directly on the spinal cord. The effects of OT and of PV electrical stimulation were reversed in a dose-dependent manner by application of the specific OT antagonist (OTA). These effects were observed in cells with reduced wind-up and cells displaying a clear wind-up response to peripheral stimulation. Superficial and deeper cells in the dorsal spinal cord were involved. The recorded cells were marked by pontamine blue iontophoretic injection after each cell recording, and their histological locations were specified.

Controls answered the questionnaire and underwent straylight measurement and (in a random one-sixth sample) cataract grading.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Retinal straylight levels and subjective visual symptoms.RESULTS: Among 230 LPI-treated subjects (121 [58.8%] with LPI totally covered by the lid, 43 [19.8%] with LPI partly covered by the lid, 53 [24.4%] with LPI uncovered by the lid), 217 (94.3%) completed all testing, as did 250 (93.3%) of 268 controls. Age, gender, and prevalence of visual symptoms did not differ between treated subjects and controls, although nuclear (P<0.01) and cortical (P = 0.03) cataract were less common among controls. Neither presenting visual acuity nor straylight score differed between the treated and untreated eyes among all treated persons, nor among those (n = 96) with LPI partially or totally uncovered. Prevalence of subjective glare did not differ significantly between participants with totally covered LPI (6.61%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.39%-12.5%), partially covered LPI (11.6%; 95% CI, 5.07%-24.5%), or totally uncovered LPI (9.43%; 95% CI, 4.10%-10.3%). In regression models, only worse cortical cataract grade (P = 0.01) was associated significantly with straylight score, and no predictors were associated with subjective glare. None of the LPI size or location parameters were associated with straylight or subjective symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggests that LPI is safe regarding measures of straylight and visual symptoms. This randomized design provides strong evidence that treatment programs for narrow angles would be unlikely to result in important medium-term visual disability.",Excluded,0.108871214

We utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with multiple b-values (diffusion weightings) to model the dose-dependency and time course of radiation effects on white matter.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with high-grade gliomas treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy underwent MRI with DTI prior to radiotherapy, and after months 1, 4-6, and 9-11. Diffusion tensors were calculated using three weightings (high, standard, and low b-values) and maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (lambda<sub></sub>), and radial diffusivity (lambda<sub></sub>) were generated. The region of interest was all white matter.RESULTS: MD, lambda<sub></sub>, and lambda<sub></sub> increased significantly with time and dose, with corresponding decrease in FA. Greater changes were seen at lower b-values, except for FA. Time-dose interactions were highly significant at 4-6months and beyond (p<.001), and the difference in dose response between high and low b-values reached statistical significance at 9-11months for MD, lambda<sub></sub>, and lambda<sub></sub> (p<.001, p<.001, p=.005 respectively) as well as at 4-6months for lambda<sub></sub> (p=.04).CONCLUSIONS: We detected dose-dependent changes across all doses, even <10Gy.

Purpose or Objective Radiation induced white matter injuries are feared side effects of brain irradiation that may cause cognitive dysfunction. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis is a valid tool to evaluate white matter (WM) integrity. A framework for the integrated analysis of tractographic and dosimetric data in brain tumor patients undergoing radiotherapy is proposed. The tool is able to simultaneously measure in specific white matter tracts the diffusion changes due to microstructural alterations and the radiation dose. Material and Methods Ten consecutive patients affected by high grade glioma were treated by conformal radiotherapy with multiple non-coplanar 6 MV photon beams from a linear accelerator with a total dose of 60 Gy in 30 daily fractions of 2 Gy. Two different time-points were planned for MRI execution (before starting RT and one month after RT). Each MRI study included, beside the DTI, threedimensional T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence (MPRAGE) before and after i.v. injection of contrast medium, as well as FLAIR and TSE-T2W images in the axial plane. The MPRAGE and the TSE-T2W images were coregistered with the b0 image and were used for the delineation of the area of parenchymal distortion (deformed area, DA). The DA included the surgical cavity and/or the area of contrast enhancement and/or the area of abnormal signal on TSE-T2W images. Deterministic fiber tracking across the whole WM was then performed using the fiber assignment continuous tracking algorithm. Fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) maps were generated. A ROI-based approach was used to select the fiber tracts. All fiber tracts passing through the DA were excluded though belonging to one of the three structures considered. The fiber tracts were converted in DICOM-RT format. The MPRAGE sequences without contrast medium were used as reference images for the co-registration with the corresponding planning CT-scan. The RT structure-set files were transferred from the MRI-space into the planning CTspace using the resulting co-registration matrix. Superimposing the dose map from each patient, the dosimetric evaluation was performed. The detailed scheme of our framework is reported in Figure 1. (Figure Presented) Results The DTI analysis was successfully performed pre and post RT. Differences in FA, RD, and AD between pre and post RT MRI were assessed. The superimposition of the fiber tracts maps with the relative information about post treatment alterations on the dosimetric information of the simulation CT was finally obtained.

788,"Brain irradiation leads to persistent neuroinflammation and long-term neurocognitive dysfunction in a region-specific manner. Long-term cognitive deficits are observed after treatment of brain tumors or metastases by radiotherapy. Treatment optimization thus requires a better understanding of the effects of radiotherapy on specific brain regions, according to their sensitivity and interconnectivity. In the present study, behavioral tests supported by immunohistology and magnetic resonance imaging provided a consistent picture of the persistent neurocognitive decline and neuroinflammation after the onset of irradiation-induced necrosis in the right primary somatosensory cortex of Fischer rats. Necrosis surrounded by neovascularization was first detected 54 days after irradiation and then spread to 110 days in the primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory region, striatum and right ventricle, resulting in fiber bundle disruption and demyelination in the corpus callosum of the right hemisphere. These structural damages translated into selective behavioral changes including spatial memory loss, disinhibition of anxiety-like behaviors, hyperactivity and pain hypersensitivity, but no significant alteration in motor coordination and grip strength abilities. Concomitantly, activated microglia and reactive astrocytes, accompanied by infiltration of leukocytes (CD45+) and T-cells (CD3+) cooperated to shape the neuroinflammation response. Overall, our study suggests that the slow and gradual onset of cellular damage would allow adaptation in brain regions that are susceptible to neuronal plasticity; while other cerebral structures that do not have this capacity would be more affected. The planning of radiotherapy, adjusted to the sensitivity and adaptability of brain structures, could therefore preserve certain neurocognitive functions; while higher doses of radiation could be delivered to brain areas that can better adapt to this treatment. In addition, strategies to block early post-radiation events need to be explored to prevent the development of long-term cognitive dysfunction.",Included,0.923263

790,"Presenilin 1 deficiency alters the activity of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in cultured cortical neurons. Presenilins 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2, respectively) play a critical role in mediating gamma-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Numerous mutations in the presenilins are known to cause early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). In addition, it is well established that PS1 deficiency leads to altered intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis involving endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores. However, there has been little evidence suggesting Ca(2+) signals from extracellular sources are influenced by PS1. Here we report that the Ca(2+) currents carried by voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels are increased in PS1-deficient cortical neurons. This increase is mediated by a significant increase in the contributions of L- and P-type Ca(2+) channels to the total voltage-mediated Ca(2+) conductance in PS1 (-/-) neurons. In addition, chelating intracellular Ca(2+) with 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) produced an increase in Ca(2+) current amplitude that was comparable to the increase caused by PS1 deficiency. In contrast to this, BAPTA had no effect on voltage-dependent Ca(2+) conductances in PS1-deficient neurons. These data suggest that PS1 deficiency may influence voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel function by means that involve intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. These findings reveal that PS1 functions at multiple levels to regulate and stabilize intracellular Ca(2+) levels that ultimately control neuronal firing behavior and influence synaptic transmission.",Excluded,0.10281713

In this study, we used a more complex time-varying input to mimic the continuous barrage of synaptic input that neurons are likely to receive in vivo. Using dual whole-cell recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons, we injected long-duration white-noise current into the dendrites. The amplitude variance of this stimulus was adjusted to produce either low subthreshold or high suprathreshold fluctuations of the somatic membrane potential. Somatic action potentials were produced in the high variance input condition. Applying a rigorous system-identification approach, we discovered that the neuronal input/output function was extremely well described by a model containing a linear bandpass filter followed by a nonlinear static-gain. Using computer models, we found that a range of voltage-dependent channel properties can readily account for the experimentally observed filtering in the neuronal input/output function. In addition, the bandpass signal processing of the neuronal input/output function was determined by the time-dependence of the channels. A simple active channel, however, could not account for the experimentally observed change in gain. These results suggest that nonlinear voltage- and time-dependent channels contribute to the linear filtering of the neuronal input/output function and that channel kinetics shape temporal signal processing in dendrites.

792,"Lateral inhibition in the inner retina is important for spatial tuning of ganglion cells. The center-surround receptive-field organization in retinal ganglion cells is widely believed to result mainly from lateral inhibition at the first synaptic level (in the outer retina). Inhibition at the second synaptic level (in the inner retina) is thought to mediate more complex response properties. Here we show that much of the sustained surround antagonism in certain on-center ganglion cells results from lateral inhibition in the inner retina, via GABAergic amacrine cells, and that the lateral conduction of this signal requires voltage-gated sodium currents. Blocking lateral inhibition in the inner retina eliminates the preference of small-center ganglion cells for small stimuli but has little effect on ganglion cells with large receptive-field centers. These results illustrate how lateral inhibition at successive synaptic stages can selectively control the size of neural receptive-field centers.",Excluded,0.10336828
793,"Microstructural changes in white matter associated with alcohol use in early phase psychosis: A diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and relaxometry study. Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that brain white matter (WM) abnormalities may be central to the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders. Additionally, cannabis use and alcohol use are each associated with WM abnormalities, however there is limited data on these substances effects on WM microstructure in psychosis, especially early phase psychosis (EPP). This study examined the impact of cannabis use and alcohol use in WM in EPP (N=21) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and transverse relaxation time of tissue water (T2), with the primary outcomes being mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and T2. Method(s): Analyses were performed at the full brain level using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis as well as within a predefined WM region of interest (ROI) implicated in psychosis (containing the left superior longitudinal fasciculus). Result(s): Our findings revealed that younger age of onset of regular alcohol use (greater than one drink per week) was associated with lower FA values in the left thalamic radiation, left parahippocampal and left amygdalar WM. Also, more frequent lifetime cannabis use was correlated with increased mean full brain FA, although this finding did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. There was no significant relationship found between FA and alcohol or cannabis use within the ROI. Relaxometry analysis revealed trend level evidence of shortened T2 with more frequent cannabis use. Conclusion(s): This study provides novel data demonstrating cortical and subcortical WM changes related to alcohol use in EPP and is the first to combine DTI and relaxometry as it relates to this patient population.",Excluded,0.15291919

797,"Locomotion and eating behavior changes in Yucatan minipigs after unilateral radio-induced ablation of the caudate nucleus. The functional roles of the Caudate nucleus (Cd) are well known. Selective Cd lesions can be found in neurological disorders. However, little is known about the dynamics of the behavioral changes during progressive Cd ablation. Current stereotactic radiosurgery technologies allow the progressive ablation of a brain region with limited adverse effects in surrounding normal tissues. This could be of high interest for the study of the modified behavioral functions in relation with the degree of impairment of the brain structures. Using hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy combined with synchrotron microbeam radiation, we investigated, during one year after irradiation, the effects of unilateral radio-ablation of the right Cd on the behavior of Yucatan minipigs. The right Cd was irradiated to a minimal dose of 35.5 Gy delivered in three fractions. MRI-based morphological brain integrity and behavioral functions, i.e. locomotion, motivation/hedonism were assessed. We detected a progressive radio-necrosis leading to a quasi-total ablation one year after irradiation, with an additional alteration of surrounding areas. Transitory changes in the motivation/hedonism were firstly detected, then on locomotion, suggesting the influence of different compensatory mechanisms depending on the functions related to Cd and possibly some surrounding areas. We concluded that early behavioral changes related to eating functions are relevant markers for the early detection of ongoing lesions occurring in Cd-related neurological disorders.",Included,0.92382133

815,"Distribution of climbing fibres on cerebellar Purkinje cells in X-irradiated rats. An electrophysiological study. 1. The distribution of climbing fibres on cerebellar Purkinje cells has been studied with intracellular recordings in X-irradiated and normal rats. 2. In the treated rats, multiple steps in the post-synaptic potential were elicited in 57% of the Purkinje cells by graded stimulation of the climbing fibres, the response was all-or-none in character in the other cells and in all Purkinje cells recorded in normal animals. In the neurones exhibiting the former type of response, no collision was seen along the afferent fibres during interaction experiments between just-threshold juxtafastigial and maximal olivary stimulations, whereas a collision always occurred when all-or-none responses were recorded. 3. These results show that in X-irradiated rats, the majority of Purkinje cells have a multiple innervation by two to four climbing fibres, instead of the one-to-one relationship seen normally. 4. Input resistances and total electrotonic lengths of Purkinje cells were measured in normal and treated rats. Mean values for these two parameters were higher than normal in multiply innervated cells. 5. Mean time course and mean current for reversal of the post-synaptic potential elicited in Purkinje cells by stimulation of the climbing fibres were nearly the same in mono- and in multiply innervated neurones. In multiply innervated cells, time courses and currents for reversal were independent of the size of the response or varied slightly with it, suggesting that the climbing fibres involved innervated territories whose electrotonic distance from the recording site were either the same or slightly different. 6. Interactions between two all-or-none steps of the graded post-synaptic potential evoked in multiply innervated cells by juxtafastigial and olivary stimulations revealed either a very weak or a very marked shunting effect between synapses of the two climbing fibres involved. 7. These results indicate that the over-all distribution of climbing fibre synapses on multiply innervated Purkinje cells is not grossly abnormal and that two fibres contacting a given cell can be either intermingled on the same dendrites, or segregated on distinct dendritic branches. 8. In general, the present study does not suggest the existence of a strong competition among climbing fibres innervating each Purkinje cell during development at least when granule cells are absent.",Included,0.92277366

827,"Morphological and behavioural changes occur following the X-ray irradiation of the adult mouse olfactory neuroepithelium. BACKGROUND: The olfactory neuroepithelium lines the upper nasal cavity and is in direct contact with the external environment and the olfactory bulbs. The ability to self-renew throughout life and the reproducible recovery after injury, make it a model tissue to study mechanisms underlying neurogenesis. In this study, X-rays were used to disrupt proliferating olfactory stem cell populations and to assess their role in the cellular and morphological changes involved in olfactory neurogenic processes.RESULTS: We have analysed the histological and functional effects of a sub-lethal dose of X-rays on the adult mouse olfactory neuroepithelium at 2 hours, 24 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks and 5 weeks. We have shown an immediate cessation of proliferating olfactory stem cells as shown by BrdU, Ki67 and pH3 expression. At 24 hours there was an increase in the neural transcription factors Mash1 and Pax6 expression, and a disruption of the basal lamina and increase in glandular cell marker expression at 1 week post-irradiation. Coincident with these changes was an impairment of the olfactory function in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown significant changes in basal cell proliferation as well as morphological changes in the olfactory neuroepithelium following X-ray irradiation. There is involvement of the basal lamina as well as a clear role for glandular and sustentacular cells.",Included,0.9239595
842,"Effects of spaceflight on ocular counterrolling and the spatial orientation of the vestibular system. We recorded the horizontal (yaw), vertical (pitch), and torsional (roll) eye movements of two rhesus monkeys with scleral search coils before and after the COSMOS Biosatellite 2229 Flight. The aim was to determine effects of adaptation to microgravity on the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The animals flew for 11 days. The first postflight tests were 22 h and 55 h after landing, and testing extended for 11 days after reentry. There were four significant effects of spaceflight on functions related to spatial orientation: (1) Compensatory ocular counterrolling (OCR) was reduced by about 70% for static and dynamic head tilts with regard to gravity. The reduction in OCR persisted in the two animals throughout postflight testing. (2) The gain of the torsional component of the angular VOR (roll VOR) was decreased by 15% and 50% in the two animals over the same period. (3) An up-down asymmetry of nystagmus, present in the two monkeys before flight was reduced after exposure to microgravity. (4) The spatial orientation of velocity storage was shifted in the one monkey that could be tested soon after flight. Before flight, the yaw axis eigenvector of optokinetic afternystagmus was close to gravity when the animal was upright or tilted. After flight, the yaw orientation vector was shifted toward the body yaw axis. By 7 days after recovery, it had reverted to a gravitational orientation. We postulate that spaceflight causes changes in the vestibular system which reflect adaptation of spatial orientation from a gravitational to a body frame of reference. These changes are likely to play a role in the postural, locomotor, and gaze instability demonstrated on reentry after spaceflight.",Included,0.9159704
