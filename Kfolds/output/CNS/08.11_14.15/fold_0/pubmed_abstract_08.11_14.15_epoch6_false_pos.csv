460,"[Influence of whole-body X-ray irradiation and 2, 4, 6-triethyleneimino- 1, 3, 5-triazine on the hypnotic effect of hexobarbital in mice (author's transl)]. The hypnotic effect of hexobarbital, measured in male NMRI-mice, was reduced during the first 24 hours after a unique or fractionated whole-body X-ray irradiation with 700 and 1400 R resp. 70 to 280 R and twelve hours after a unique intravenous injection of 16,0 mg tretamine per kilogram of body weight. Immediately after a unique injection of a high dose of tretamine and 24 hours after the last of four applications of 0,25 to 2,0 mg/kg which were repeated each after one day, the sleeping time after hexobarbital was prolonged. 24 hours after fractionated injection of tretamine (0,5 mg/kg each time), the concentration of hexobarbital in the brain showed a significant increase compared with the control animals. These results show that the decreased effect of hexobarbital in the early post-irradiation phase is based on pharmacodynamic processes while the increase of the effect produced by continued administration of tretamine can be explained by pharmaco-cinetic reasons.",Excluded,0.9539894
753,"Mitigation of radiation myelopathy and reduction of microglial infiltration by Ramipril, ACE inhibitor. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor Ramipril, as a mitigator of radiation-induced spinal cord injury.SETTING: Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.METHODS: Total of 22 rats were irradiated with single doses of 23.6-33 Gy at the C4-T2 spinal levels. After irradiation, the rats were randomized to the radiation only control group and the Ramipril-treated (radiation + Ramipril) experimental group. Ramipril 1.5 mg/kg/day was given in the drinking water starting 1 week after radiation through the study duration.RESULTS: All the rats irradiated with 28.5-33 Gy became paralyzed at 125 +/- 4 days, whereas no rats became paralyzed after 23.6 Gy. The time to develop paralysis was delayed to 135 +/- 4 days in Ramipril-treated group (P < 0.001). H&E and LFB showed microscopic structural restoration and remyelination with Ramipril treatment. VEGF expression was increased in the irradiated spinal cord, and the number of VEGF-positive cells was significantly decreased by Ramipril treatment (P < 0.001). Immunohistochemical stain with Iba-1 showed increased microglial infiltration in the irradiated spinal cords. The number of Iba-1-positive microglia was significantly reduced by Ramipril treatment (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Ramipril reduced the rate of paralysis even at the paralysis-inducing radiation doses. It also significantly delayed the onset of paralysis. Neuroinflammation and endothelial cell damage may be the key mediators of radiation injury. Ramipril can be readily translatable to clinical application as a mitigatory of radiotherapeutic toxicity.",Excluded,0.9539649
538,"Pharmacological alterations that could underlie radiation-induced changes in associative memory and anxiety. It is widely known that ionizing radiation is a physical agent broadly used to kill tumor cells during human cancer therapy. Unfortunately, adjacent normal tissues can concurrently undergo undesirable cell injury. Previous data of our laboratory demonstrated that exposure of developing rats to ionizing radiations induced a variety of behavioral differences respect to controls, including changes in associative memory and in anxiety state. However, there is a lack of data concerning modifications in different related pharmacological intermediaries. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether the behavioral differences observed in young animals irradiated at birth might be underlain by early changes in PKCs1 levels which, in turn, could lead to changes in hippocampal GABAergic neurotransmission. Male Wistar rats were irradiated with 5Gy of X rays between 24 and 48 h after birth. Different pharmacological markers related to the affected behavioral tasks were assessed in control and irradiated hippocampus at 15 and 30 days, namely GABAA receptor, GAD65-67, ROS and PKCs1. Results showed that all measured parameters were increased in the hippocampus of 30-days-old irradiated animals. In contrast, in the hippocampus of 15-days-old irradiated animals only the levels of PKCs1 were decreased. These data suggest that PKCs1 might constitute a primary target for neonatal radiation damage on the hippocampus. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that an initial decrease in the levels of this protein can trigger a subsequent compensatory increase that, in turn, could be responsible for the plethora of biochemical changes that might underlie the previously observed behavioral alterations.",Excluded,0.95388675
1064,"Neuroprotective effect of EGb761 and low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. The present study was undertaken to investigate the pretreatment effects of standardized Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) and low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation on the neurological dysfunction in the reserpine model of PD. Male Wistar rats were pretreated orally with EGb761 or fractionated low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation or their combination, then subjected to intraperitoneal injection of reserpine (5 mg/kg body weight) 24 h after the final dose of EGb761 or radiation. Reserpine injection resulted in the depletion of striatal dopamine (DA) level, increased catalepsy score, increased oxidative stress indicated via depletion of glutathione (GSH), increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and iron levels, decreased DA metabolites metabolizing enzymes; indicated by inhibition by glutathione-S-transferase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-quinone oxidoreductase (NQO) activities, mitochondrial dysfunction; indicated by declined complex I activity, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level and increased apoptosis; indicated by decreased mitochondrial B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein level and by transmission electron microscope. EGb761 and low-dose gamma-radiation ameliorated the reserpine-induced state of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis in brain. It can be concluded that EGb761, a widely used herbal medicine and low dose of gamma-irradiation have protective effects for combating Parkinsonism possibly via replenishment of GSH levels.

539,"Long-lasting effects of neonatal ionizing radiation exposure on spatial memory and anxiety-like behavior. Neonatal ionizing radiation exposure has been shown to induce a cerebellar cytoarchitecture disarrangement. Since cerebellar abnormalities have been linked to an impairment of behavioral functions, the aim of the present work was to investigate whether exposure of developing rats to ionizing radiations can produce behavioral deficits in the adult. Male Wistar rats were X-irradiated with 5Gy within 48h after birth and were tested in a radial maze and in an open field at 30 and 90 days post irradiation. Irradiated rats showed significative changes in spatial, exploratory, and procedural parameters in the radial maze, as well as a significative decrease in anxiety-like behavior, assessed in the open field. These results suggest that ionizing radiations can induce long-lasting spatial memory and anxiety-related changes. A relationship with radiation-induced cerebellar cytoarchitecture abnormalities supports the hypothesis that cerebellar integrity seems to be critical to achieve spatial performance and emotional behavior establishment.",Excluded,0.95379883
129,"The human acoustic neurinoma in organ culture. II. Tissue changes after gamma irradiation. Acoustic neurinoma tissue in organ culture was exposed to gamma irradiation (60CO) 30-150 Gy single dose. Schwann cell degeneration occurred from the first week onward in vitro following irradiation. After 3 weeks only a limited number of surviving cells were observed in the specimens, as compared with controls. The in vitro changes in tissue morphology indicate an irreversible course even after irradiation with the lowest dose, 30 Gy single dose. As a comparison with the in vitro experimental material it has also been possible to analyse the light and electron microscopic morphology of a tumour from a patient previously treated with stereotactic radiosurgery.

930,"Effect of exposure to low-dose gamma radiation during late organogenesis in the mouse fetus. The abdominal region of pregnant Swiss mice was exposed to 0.05 to 0.50 Gy of gamma radiation on day 11.5 postcoitus. The animals were sacrificed on day 18 of gestation and the fetuses were examined for mortality, growth retardation, changes in head size and brain weight, and incidence of microphthalmia. No marked increase in fetal mortality or growth retardation was observed below 0.25 Gy; the increase in these parameters was significant only at 0.50 Gy. A significant reduction in head size and brain weight and a significant increase in the incidence of microphthalmia were observed at doses above 0.15 Gy. Detectable levels of microcephaly and microphthalmia were evident even at 0.10 Gy. A linear dose response was seen for these effects in the dose range of 0.05 to 0.15 Gy. It is concluded that the late period of organogenesis in the mouse, especially between days 10 and 12 postcoitus, is a particularly sensitive phase in the development of the skull, brain and eye.",Excluded,0.95373774

Objective: To determine if LDWBI can retard the memory disturbance progression in a genetically altered AD mouse Methods: 16 month B6.Cg-Tg ( APPswePSEN1dE9 ) 85Dbo/J mice were given LDWBI (5 x 200 cGy (n=19 )) and compared to untreated animals ( n=14 ). Neurocognitive testing utilized the Morris Water Maze with a Noldus Etho Vision video tracking system. Testing was completed pre treatment and then 8 weeks after treatment at which time the animals were then sacrificed. Mice were trained with 3 trials/day ( 90 second maximum ) with a 30 minute intra-trial interval for 5 consecutive days. At sacrifice amyloid count , volume , synaptophysin along with other stains were completed Results: Latency period for controls pre treatment were 58 secs ( SD +/- 23s ) and 48 secs (SD +/- 15s ) for 'to be treated' animals ( p=.39 ). At 8 weeks post treatment the control animals latency period was 60 secs ( SD +/- 15s) and for the treated animals it was 31secs(SD+/- 17s) (p=0.03 ) The treatment group located the platform significantly faster than the control animals on the final day of testing. This finding was not attributed to baseline learning the groups did not differ in latency to find the platform pre treatment Treatment animals had statistically lower amyloid plaque numbers and trended towards significance in volume of residual plaques Conclusion(s): This data confirms our previous hemi brain irradiation data but documents improved memory performance when LDWBI is utilized.

The induction of DNA strand breaks was studied after killing the rats within 1 min after irradiation, and the repair of the induced breaks after various intervals up to 180 min. Cell suspensions were prepared from the brain and samples were transferred into alkaline solutions. The fraction of DNA remaining double-stranded after 30 min alkali treatment was estimated after separation of single- and double-stranded DNA on hydroxylapatite. The amount of DNA strand breaks induced per Gray (1--8 Gray) was found to be in accordance with earlier in vivo studies of the mouse small intestine and mouse spleen.

595,"Neonatal gamma-ray irradiation impairs learning and memory of an olfactory associative task in adult rats. Adult neonatally gamma-irradiated rats were compared with control animals in a non-spatial olfactory associative task using two different procedures. Irradiation induced a clear reduction in the total mean area of the olfactory bulbs and hippocampus but not of the orbital prefrontal cortex, diagonal band and cell layers of the entorhinal and piriform cortex. The gamma-irradiation affected the granule cells of the olfactory bulbs and differentially altered the cell layers of the subfields of the ammonic fields and the dorsal and ventral blades of the dentate gyrus. In the CA1 ammonic field, dorsal and ventral blades of the dentate gyrus, the cellular loss was significant in comparison with control adult rats. The behavioural data indicated that irradiated rats were deeply disturbed in learning the odour-reward association, and substantially impaired in a reversal experiment, but not in the discrimination of the odours per se. The cellular loss in the olfactory bulbs, in the CA1 and in the ventral blade of the gyrus dentatus was positively correlated with the deficit in behavioural performance. The data support the findings that the hippocampal system participates in the odour-reward associations and facilitates the long-term storage of associations after learning is achieved in this olfactory associative task.",Excluded,0.9536874
525,"Cognitive Impairments in Subjects Exposed to Radiation during Prenatal Development. Objective. To evaluate cognitive status in subjects exposed to ionizing radiation during antenatal development. Materials and methods. A total of 77 subjects with antenatal exposure to radiation were studied, along with a reference group of 73 subjects living in radiologically unpolluted territories in the Chelyabinsk region. Clinical, clinical psychological (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test (WAIS), and proverb interpretation) neurophysiological (EEG), and laboratory (cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoproteins triglycerides, cortisol, melatonin) methods were used. Results and discussion. These investigations showed that a significantly greater proportion of subjects exposed to radiation during antenatal development had nonpsychotic mental disorders with a predominance of organic mental impairments (cognitive and asthenic). Neurophysiological studies identified more profound abnormalities in brain bioelectrical activity with pathological rhythms and a predominance of the theta rhythm among those exposed to radiation. Clinical psychological study data identified a significant decrease in analytical-synthetic ability in irradiated subjects, along with lower general and verbal IQ levels. These changes were accompanied by higher cortisol and melatonin levels, supporting activation of and tension in the mechanisms of adaptation in subjects irradiated during antenatal development.

Radiation-induced local white matter (WM) damage has been observed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) within a priori-defined regions of interest following radiotherapy (RT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this study, we aimed to detect WM changes throughout the brain of NPC patients by DTI. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used to analyze DTI data from 81 NPC patients. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were quantified across the whole brain in separate groups: pre-RT, and <6, 6-12, and >12 months post-RT. We found that fractional anisotropy values were significantly lower in the right frontal, parietal, and occipital WM <6 months post-RT compared with pre-RT and remained significantly lower in the right frontal and parietal WM at >12 months. MD values were significantly higher in the right occipital, bilateral temporal, right occipital-temporal junction, left parietal, left centrum semiovale, and left frontal-parietal junction WM <6 months post-RT and remained higher in the right occipital WM at >12 months. This study suggests that changes in white matter microstructure following RT for NPC were widespread, complex, and dynamic. Diffusion tensor imaging with TBSS analysis allows for early non-invasive detection of RT-induced WM damage.",Excluded,0.9536523
123,"Radiation effects on neural precursor cells in the dentate gyrus. Ionizing irradiation is an effective treatment for intracranial tumors but is limited by the potential adverse effects induced in surrounding normal brain. These effects can include cognitive impairments, and whereas the pathogenesis of such injury has not yet been definitively established, it may involve injury to the neurogenic cell population that exists in the dentate subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus. Understanding the issues surrounding this topic could have a major impact in the management of specific sequelae associated with cranial irradiation.

1155,"Evidence of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and identification of dying cells in X-ray-induced cell death in the developing brain. Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats received a single dose of 2 Gy X-rays and were killed 6 hr later. Dying cells were characterized by extreme chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Dying cells were distributed in the primary and secondary germinal zones and in other brain regions. Among these latter, dying cells occurred in the cortical layers of the olfactory bulb, layers II-III and VIb of the neocortex, piriform and entorhinal cortex, stratum oriens and pyramidale of the hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, amygdala, brainstem, internal granular layer of the cerebellum, and cerebral and cerebellar white matter. Dying cells were immature cells, neurons and glial cells (including radial glia). In-situ labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation identified individual cells bearing fragmented DNA. Since the number of cells stained with this method was larger than the number of dying cells, as revealed with current histological techniques, it is suggested that nuclear DNA fragmentation precedes chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation in X-ray-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, agarose gel electrophoresis of extracted DNA from irradiated brains showed a ""ladder"" pattern which is typical of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and endonuclease activation.",Excluded,0.9535467

In neonate and infant rats the area of cerebellum was irradiated with different schedules of single or multiple doses of low-level X-ray. One set of schedules allowed the early recovery of the external germinal layer and the differentiation of all the postnatally-forming cell types while the other selectively prevented the acquisition of basket cells. The first schedule did not interfere with the development of normally oriented and arborizing Purkinje cells. The second schedule led to the growth of twisted and entwined stem dendrites even when, in association, with the recovered granule cells, parallel fibers were present in the molecular layer together with Purkinje cell spiny branchlets. Evidence was presented that the alignment of Purkinje cell perikarya in a monolayer does not guarantee the normal growth of Purkinje cell stem dendrites which may be dependent on the presence of basket cells.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) may cause cognitive and neuropsychological impairment and hence objective assessment of adverse effects of radiation may be valuable to plan therapy. The purpose of our study was to determine the potential of echo planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in detecting subacute radiation induced injury to the normal brain.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients with brain metastases and three patients with lung cancer underwent cranial irradiation. These patients were subjected to 3D-EPSI and DTI at two time points (pre-radiation, and 1 month post-irradiation). Parametric maps of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) were generated and co-registered to post-contrast T1-weighted images. Normal appearing gray-matter and white-matter regions were compared between the two time points to assess sub-acute effects of radiation using independent sample t-tests.RESULTS: Significantly increased MD (P = .02), Cho/Cr (P = .02) and a trend towards a decrease in NAA/Cr (P = .06) was observed from the hippocampus. Significant decrease in FA (P = .02) from the centrum-semiovale and a significant increase in MD (P = .04) and Cho/Cr (P = .02) from genu of corpus-callosum was also observed.CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that 3D-EPSI and DTI may provide quantitative measures of radiation induced injury to the normal brain.",Excluded,0.9533007

Gamma knife radiosurgery is an attractive noninvasive treatment of brain tumors and vascular malformations that minimizes collateral tissue damage. However, exposure of normal tissue to even low-dose radiation triggers a cascade of acute and chronic injury and potentially significant morbidity and mortality. Because many irradiated patients now survive for years, identifying methods to prevent radiotherapy-induced collateral tissue damage is a major focus of current research. Erythropoietin (EPO), a cytokine produced locally by many tissues in response to injury, antagonizes apoptosis, reduces inflammation, and promotes healing. Systemic administration of recombinant EPO, widely used for treatment of anemia, provides robust protection from numerous insults in a variety of tissues, including the brain. Although irradiation injury is likely sensitive to EPO, the hematopoietic activity of EPO is undesirable in this setting, increasing erythrocyte number and predisposing to thrombosis. To avoid these potential adverse effects, we developed carbamylated EPO (CEPO) which does not stimulate the bone marrow. In this study, we show that CEPO (50 microg kg(-1) intraperitoneally) improves functional outcome when administered to adult rats just before, and then once daily for 10 d after, a necrotizing dose of radiation (100 Gy) to the right striatum. Immediately following irradiation, use and reflex movements of the contralateral forelimb to vibrissae stimulation were abnormal but rapidly improved in animals receiving CEPO. Moreover, histological examination revealed that the extent of brain necrosis after 90 days was reduced by approximately 50%.

Instead, less aggressive but still QOL-compromising encephalopathy has been recognized for the past 20 years. This encephalopathy occurs in senior adults several months after the extended field irradiation with even less amount of irradiation dose such as 40 Gy whole brain irradiation.

In a cohort of 342 patients operated and irradiated for pituitary tumors, 31 died from CVD (CVD patients) between 1952 and 1996. The study assessed whether the radiation regimens and duration of symptoms of hypopituitarism before operation differed between the 31 CVD patients and the 62 matched patients from the same cohort who had not died from CVD (control patients). Furthermore, the infarction/hemorrhage ratio, type of clinical stroke syndrome, and time to death after stroke were investigated in the CVD patients and in matched controls from the general population who had died from CVD (population controls). No significant differences in maximum or centrally absorbed dose, maximum or central biological equivalent dose, field size, or number of fraction were recorded between CVD and control patients. A significant difference in the duration of symptoms of hypopituitarism before operation was recorded, but only in women (P = 0.01).

In conclusion, no significant effect on CVD deaths could be detected for any radiation parameter.

These studies are intended eventually to increase our knowledge about the safety and efficacy of radiosurgery in both the normal and tumor-implanted brains. We believe that such fundamental studies ultimately will improve our ability to reach the goals of radiosurgery: to destroy the target and spare the surrounding brain. Eventually, it may become feasible to achieve these goals by combining radiosurgical technique with both radiation sensitizers (for the treated volume) and brain protectors.

290,"Transcriptional changes in U343 MG-a glioblastoma cell line exposed to ionizing radiation. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly invasive and radioresistant brain tumor. Aiming to study how glioma cells respond to gamma-rays in terms of biological processes involved in cellular responses, we performed experiments at cellular context and gene expression analysis in U343-MG-a GBM cells irradiated with 1 Gy and collected at 6 h post-irradiation. The survival rate was approximately 61% for 1 Gy and was completely reduced at 16 Gy. By performing the microarray technique, 859 cDNA clones were analyzed. The Significance Analysis of Microarray algorithm indicated 196 significant expressed genes (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.42%): 67 down-regulated and 97 up-regulated genes, which belong to several classes: metabolism, adhesion/cytoskeleton, signal transduction, cell cycle/apoptosis, membrane transport, DNA repair/DNA damage signaling, transcription factor, intracellular signaling, and RNA processing. Differential expression patterns of five selected genes (HSPA9B, INPP5A, PIP5K1A, FANCG, and TPP2) observed by the microarray analysis were further confirmed by the quantitative real time RT-PCR method, which demonstrated an up-regulation status of those genes. These results indicate a broad spectrum of biological processes (which may reflect the radio-resistance of U343 cells) that were altered in irradiated glioma cells, so as to guarantee cell survival. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",Excluded,0.9524671

Sixteen patients with primary brain tumours were examined on average eight years after treatment with surgery or whole brain irradiation using standard clinical assessment, CT, a neuropsychological test battery, and single photon emission CT (SPECT) with 99mTc-exametazime. Seventeen lesions were discovered on inspection of SPECT images, 11 with x-ray CT. Quantitative assessment of tracer uptake compared with 16 matched healthy volunteers was consistent with the presence of lesions. Measurement of uptake in brain regions of the hemisphere not containing the primary tumour still showed significant reductions in patients. This may be due to remote direct effects of the tumour or, more likely, to the whole brain irradiation received. Psychometric performance on most tests was significantly impaired in the patient group and was correlated with abnormalities of tracer uptake to relevant brain regions.",Excluded,0.9524542

Effects of X-ray irradiation to the pituitary and transfrontal hypophysectomy were evaluated on the responsiveness of plasma growth hormone (GH) to exogenous stimuli in 8 patients with acromegaly. As exogenous stimuli, arginine, TRH, LH-RH and L-dopa were administered. In 2 out of 3 patients treated with Liniac irradiation, the responsiveness to arginine was essentially unchanged, while in the third patient positive response to arginine disappeared after therapy. Of 2 patients who received a combination of hypophysectomy and Liniac irradiation, the responsiveness to arginine, TRH, LH-RH and L-dopa did not change in 1 patient, but in the other it was observed that negative response to L-dopa became positive after the treatment, remaining the unchanged responsiveness to arginine, TRH, and LH-RH. In 3 hypophysectomized patients, little change in responses to the above 4 stimuli was observed. In summary, out of 22 pairs of responses (pre- and post-therapy) examined 20 were not altered. In 11 pairs of responses (pre- and post-irradiation) particularly, 10 were essentially unchanged.

816,"Fate of the multiple innervation of cerebellar Purkinje cells by climbing fibers in immature control, x-irradiated and hypothyroid rats. The fate of the multiple innervation of Purkinje cells (PCs) by climbing fibers (CFs) was studied as a function of age in immature rats rendered agranular by X-irradiation, in immature hypothyroid rats, and compared to that in controls. This was done by examining in each group the intracellular activities of PCs mediated via CFs throughout maturation. From the third day in control rats, CF responses of PCs evoked by juxta fastigial region (JF) stimulation or occurring spontaneously already resembled the adult responses with, however, some important differences: (1) most of these responses were graded by steps with the intensity of the stimulation before day 13, due to the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs (see below); (2) immature CF responses exhibited a longer duration and their initial spike started near the peak of the EPSP instead of near the baseline later on. Finally, an anlage of CF response was already present in most PCs on day 2, and consisted of a single fast spike elicited near the peak of an underlying all-or-none EPSP. In the 3 groups of rats, CF EPSPs already closely resembled the adult ones as early as 3 days, although their total duration and especially their time to peak were longer. In control rats, these CF EPSPs reversed with depolarizing currents from day 3 and currents for reversal were much lower than in the adult. 'Dual' CF EPSPs of PCS37 were encountered in immature 7- to 10-day-old controls, and persisted in hypothyroid rats until the end of the third postnatal week. The mono- or the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was ascertained in th 3 groups according to the graded or the all-or-none character of CF EPSPs, and the number of CFs impinging on a given PC was estimated by the number of steps in the response. In control rats, most of PCs were already multiply innervated by CFs as early as 3 days. The multiple innervation culminated on day 5 with an average number of 3.4 CFs for PC, and rapidly regressed later on, so that the adult-type monoinnervation was the rule after day 13. In hypothyroid rats, the establishment of the redundancy and its regression was delayed by 2--3 days. In X-irradiated rats, the settlement and the involution of the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was exactly superimposed with that seen in controls until day 8. Later on, regression of the supernumerary contacts no longer occurred so that most PCs remained multiply innervated until adulthood. Finally, the first clear-cut IPSPs were detected in PCs on day 9 in control and X-irradiated rats and 2--3 days later in hypothyroid animals.",Excluded,0.95218843

Objective: We studied the effect of reirradiation to the vestibular apparatus in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC). Patients and Methods: A total of 52 reirradiated NPC patients underwent regular follow-up at Tzu Chi Hospital. Nine were diagnosed with vestibular apparatus disorders, based on detailed histories and balance function tests which included an illegible E-test, and refixation saccade test as well as bithermal air caloric and rotary chair tests. The clinical characteristics were analyzed. Result(s): Of 9 patients with vestibular apparatus disorders, seven had bilateral loss of vestibular function, one had vestibular neuronitis and one had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The 7 patients with bilateral loss of vestibular function had bilateral otitis media and moderate to profound bilateral hearing loss. Illegible E-test, refixation saccade test, electronystagmography, bithermal air caloric test and rotary chair test are useful tools for diagnosis. All 9 patients received total radiation dosages over 12,000 cGy. Conclusion(s): Bilateral loss of vestibular function is the most common vestibular apparatus disorder in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma following reirradiation. Severe hearing loss and otitis media after high dosage radiation may predispose a patient to this disorder.",Excluded,0.9515714

BACKGROUND: The spinal cord, known for its strongly serial character and high sensitivity to radiation even when a small segment is irradiated, is one of the most critical organs at risk to be spared during radiation therapy. To compare the sensitivity of different parts of the spinal cord, data for radiation myelopathy have been used.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present study, the relative seriality model was fitted to two different datasets of clinical radiation myelitis concerning cervical spinal cord after treating 248 patients for head and neck cancer and thoracic spinal cord after treating 43 patients with lung carcinoma. The maximum likelihood method was applied to fit the clinical data. The model parameters and their 68% confidence intervals were calculated for each dataset. The alpha/beta ratio for the thoracic cord was also was also found to be 0.9 (0-3.0) Gy.RESULTS: The dose-response curve for the more sensitive cervical myelopathy is well described by the parameters D(50)=55.9 (54.8-57.1) Gy, gamma=6.9 (5.0-9.2), s=0.13 (0.07-0.24), whereas the thoracic myelopathy is described by the parameters D(50)=75.5 (70.5-80.8) Gy, gamma=1.1 (0.6-1.6), s=36 (3.3-infinity).DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Large differences in radiation response between the cervical and thoracic region of spinal cord are thus observed: cervical myelopathy seems to be characterized by medium seriality, while thoracic spinal cord is characterized by a highly serial dose-response. The much steeper dose-response curve for cervical spinal cord myelopathy can be interpreted as a higher number of functional subunits consistent with a higher amount of white matter close to the brain.",Excluded,0.95137304

The etiology is unknown, but it may involve increased oxidative stress. A line of experimental evidence indicates that space flight may disrupt antioxidant defense system and result in increased oxidative stress. In vitro studies found that abundant of NO was produced in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and protein nitration was increased in PC12 cells within a simulated microgravity rotating wall bioreactor high aspect ratio vessel system or clinostat system. In the present study, we observed the change of redox status in SH-SY5Y cells after parabolic flight, and studied the effects of key redox molecule, thioredoxin (TRX), during the altered gravity. SH-SY5Y cells were divided into four groups: control cells, control cells transfected with TRX, flight cells and flight cells transfected with TRX. The expression levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TRX and thioredoxin reductase (TRXR) were observed by immunocytochemical method. It was shown that after parabolic flight, the staining of 3-NT and TRX were enhanced, while the expression level of TRXR was down-regulated compared with control. As for flight cells transfected with TRX, the staining of 3-NT and iNOS were weakened compared with flight cells. These results obtained suggest that altered gravity may increase protein nitration, down-regulate TRXR and elicit oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells, while TRX transfection could partly protect cells against oxidative stress induced by parabolic flight.",Excluded,0.95113444

Brain homogenates from 22-month-old rats were more susceptible to oxidative stress than those from three-month- old rats. Brain was more susceptible to oxidative damage than the heart.

We have found that OMMT sp. act. can be increased, although to a lower extent, in kidney, spleen and brain in addition to liver. However, the sp. act. of OMMT in lung was reduced by irradiation. OMMT has been purified from the livers of irradiated rats by solubilization in high-salt-containing buffer, ammonium sulfate precipitation and a series of column chromatographic steps, including phenyl-Sepharose, heparin-agarose, double-stranded DNA-cellulose and FPLC. A 3000-fold enrichment of OMMT was achieved from the induced liver preparations.

972,"The frequency of adverse events by radiation therapy for atomic bomb survivors with cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): In Japan, there are many survivors who received ionizing radiation by atomic bomb in 1945. Currently, atomic bomb survivors (ABS) who suffered from cancer are treated as same as usual cancer patients. However, it remains unclear whether the adverse events (AE) of radiation therapy (RT) are increased or not in ABS. To clarify the safety of RT for ABS, we evaluated the frequency of AE by RT in ABS. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively investigated medical records of patients who received curative RT for cancer between 2005 and 2010. We selected the ABS who were officially certified by the Japanese government. AE were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) score Ver.3. One hundred and sixty-five ABS were recruited in this study. Median age was 74 years old (59 to 93) and 96 (58.2%) were men. Median age at the time receiving ionizing radiation by atomic bomb was 11 years old (0 to 32). One hundred and thirty-six ABS (82.4%) were pre-treatment performance status (PS) 0, 21 (12.7%) was PS 1, and 8 (4.8%) were PS 2 or over. Thirty-seven were diagnosed with head and neck, 32 with genitourinary, 29 with breast, 27 with gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary and pancreatic, 23 with lung and mediastinum, and 17 with other cancer. Result(s): One hundred four ABS were definitive irradiation, 48 were postoperative irradiation, and 13 were pre-operative irradiation. Concurrent chemotherapy was performed on 51. Median dose of external RTwas 50 Gy (30 to 78) based on their cancer type. Fifteen patients were performed on stereotactic RT, 12 on intensity-modulated RT, and 11 on brachytherapy. All patients were received standard dose irradiation and completed planned RT. No patients received extended RTover 1 week. Median observation time was 40 months (1 to 84). One hundred fifty-six patients (94.5%) were alive and 9 (5.5%) were dead when at the time investigated. There were no patients who died of AE in the entire course. In acute AE, sixteen patients (9.7%) were classified into grade 3 or above, i.e. one with esophageal mucositis and 15 with hematotoxicity (Grade 3: 11, Grade 4: 4). All these patients received concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Grade 4 or 5 non-hematotoxicitic AE was not identified. In late AE, twelve patients (7.3%) were classified into Grade 3 or above. Four patients were classified into Grade 4, i.e. 3 with myelodysplastic syndrome and 1 with cerebral infarction. Conclusion(s): Notable incensements of AE were not observed during and after RT for ABS. This study clarified that standard dose RT prescription can be administered safely to ABS with cancer even though they received ionizing radiation by atomic bomb before half century.",Excluded,0.9504444

BACKGROUND: To lower the risk of complications, carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has been proposed as an alternative to open surgery for carotid artery stenosis after neck irradiation. However, there are little postoperative data to support the benefits of this strategy. This study evaluated the outcome of CAS in patients who had undergone neck irradiation.METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at 15 vascular surgery or interventional radiology centers in France between January 1998 and July 2006. A total of 135 patients (115 men) with a mean age of 67 +/- 8 years (range, 43-88) underwent CAS for 149 irradiation-induced lesions. The interval between irradiation and discovery of the lesions was 12 +/- 8 years. Mean diameter reduction was 81% (range, 50%-95%), and stenosis was symptomatic in 34%. Contralateral carotid lesions were observed in 48% of patients, including thrombosis in 18 and stenosis >50% in 53.RESULTS: Technical failure occurred during CAS in three cases. The overall technical success rate was 98%. A cerebral protection device was used in 59%. No death, one transient ischemic attack, and two strokes occurred during the first postoperative month. Mean follow-up was 30 months. Six patients were lost to follow-up. Survival rates were 93.9% at 1 year and 75.3% at 3 years. Complications after the first postoperative month included neurologic events in six, carotid thrombosis in nine, and restenosis in 18. The rates of freedom from neurologic and anatomic events were, respectively, 96.2% and 93.2% at 1 year and 93.1% and 85.9% at 3 years.CONCLUSION: The immediate outcome of CAS for irradiation-induced carotid artery stenosis was satisfactory. Medium-term neurologic outcome was acceptable, but the incidence of anatomic events such as thrombosis and restenosis was high. A randomized study is needed to confirm that the outcome of the endovascular and surgical therapy is comparable in this indication.",Excluded,0.95022166

Purpose: To investigate MRI myelin water imaging (MWI) by multicomponent T<inf>2</inf> relaxometry as a quantitative imaging biomarker for brain radiation-induced changes and to compare it with DTI. Method(s): Sixteen patients underwent fractionated proton therapy (PT) receiving dose to the healthy tissue because of direct or indirect (base skull tumors) irradiation. MWI was performed by a multi-echo sequence with 32 equally spaced echoes (10-320 ms). Decay data were processed to identify 3 T<inf>2</inf> compartments: myelin water (Mw) below 40 ms, intra-extracellular water (IEw) between 40 and 250 ms, and free water (CSFw) above 250 ms. Both MWI and DTI scans were acquired pre (pre)-treatment and immediately at the end (end) of PT. After image registration, voxel-wise difference maps, obtained by subtracting MWI and DTI pre from those acquired at the end of PT, were compared with the corresponding biological equivalent dose (BED). Result(s): Mw difference showed a positive correlation and IEw difference showed a negative correlation with BED considering end-pre changes (P <.01). The changes in CSFw were not significantly correlated with the delivered BED. The changes in DTI data, considering end-pre acquisitions, showed a positive correlation between fractional anisotropy and the delivered BED. Conclusion(s): MWI might detect early white matter radiation-induced alterations, providing additional information to DTI, which might improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of the radiation damage.

858,"Use of human mesenchymal stem cell treatment to prevent anhedonia in a rat model of traumatic brain injury. PURPOSE: Major depression and related mood disorders are the most common long-term outcomes associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Given the potentially debilitating consequences of depression, and the fact that TBI patients are frequently refractory to antidepressant drugs, new therapies are clearly needed. We hypothesized that human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), delivered intravenously, can effectively treat TBI-induced depression and other behavioral deficits associated with TBI.METHODS: Rats (n = 8 per group) were subjected to experimental TBI or control sham operation. Six hours post TBI, rats were treated with 1x106 hMSC or vehicle control. Immediately after TBI and prior to hMSC or control treatment, rats were subjected to either targeted precision x-ray irradiation to eliminate subventricular zone (SVZ) proliferation or sham irradiation. One week after TBI, SVZ irradiation, and hMSC treatment, rats were evaluated for the depression-like behavior, anhedonia, using the two-bottle saccharin preference paradigm; and for working memory using the novel object recognition test.RESULTS: TBI resulted in a 54% (p<=0.05) decrease in saccharin preference scores while treatment of TBI with hMSC fully prevented this anhedonic behavior. TBI was also found to produce a 73% (p<=0.05) decrease in novel object interaction time, indicating impaired working memory, and was similarly improved by treatment with hMSC. The ability of hMSC to prevent TBI-associated depression and working memory impairment was eliminated when SVZ proliferation was inhibited by irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: This work has identified a possible role for hMSC in the treatment of TBI-induced depression and other behaviors and suggests a mechanistic role for proliferative cells of the SVZ proliferation in hMSC efficacy.",Excluded,0.95013714

Cognitive toxicity induced by cranial radiation is one of the most important limitations of radiation therapy and has a significant impact on brain tumor survivors' quality of life. This review comprehends an up to date of recent studies including complete neuropsychological battery and/or advanced neuroimaging techniques. These studies identified critical anatomical and/or functional brain areas related to radiation-induced brain injury, thus improving clinical and radiological diagnosis. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive toxicity are complex and involve different cell lines and molecules. Although there is no currently therapeutic strategy that has a demonstrated efficacy, several studies including sparing of hippocampus or the use of memantine are quite promising. A better knowledge of the characteristics of cognitive toxicity induced by cranial radiation, will help us to identify patients who will benefit from treatment and also to examine new therapeutic targets in order to improve patients' quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of the spine provides superior tumor control, but vertebral compression fractures are increased and the pathophysiological process underneath is not well understood. Data on histopathological changes, particularly after salvage SBRT (sSBRT) following conventional irradiation, are scarce.OBJECTIVE: To investigate surgical specimens after sSBRT and primary SBRT (pSBRT) regarding histopathological changes.METHODS: We assessed 704 patients treated with spine SBRT 2006 to 2012. Thirty patients underwent salvage surgery; 23 histopathological reports were available. Clinical and histopathological findings were analyzed for sSBRT (69.6%) and pSBRT (30.4%).RESULTS: Mean time to surgery after sSBRT/pSBRT was 8.3/10.3 mo (P = .64). Reason for surgery included pain (sSBRT/pSBRT: 12.5%/71.4%, P = .25), fractures (sSBRT/pSBRT: 37.5%/28.6%, P = .68), and neurological symptoms (sSBRT/pSBRT: 68.8%/42.9%, P = .24). Radiological tumor progression after sSBRT/pSBRT was seen in 71.4%/42.9% (P = .2). Most specimens displayed viable/proliferative tumor (sSBRT/pSBRT: 62.5%/71.4%, P = .68 and 56.3%/57.1%, P = .97). Few specimens showed soft tissue necrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 20%/28.6%, P = .66), osteonecrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 14.3%/16.7%, P = .89), or bone marrow fibrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 42.9%/33.3%, P = .69). Tumor bed necrosis was more common after sSBRT (81.3%/42.9%, P = .066). Radiological tumor progression correlated with viable/proliferative tumor (P = .03/P = .006) and tumor bed necrosis (P = .03). Fractures were increased with bone marrow fibrosis (P = .07), but not with osteonecrosis (P = .53) or soft tissue necrosis (P = .19). Neurological symptoms were common with radiological tumor progression (P = .07), but not with fractures (P = .18).CONCLUSION: For both, sSBRT and pSBRT, histopathological changes were similar. Neurological symptoms were attributable to tumor progression and pathological fractures were not associated with osteonecrosis or tumor progression.",Excluded,0.9486079
1097,"The role of functional imaging in the diagnosis and management of late normal tissue injury. Normal tissue injury after radiation therapy (RT) can be defined based on either clinical symptoms or laboratory/radiologic tests. In the research setting, functional imaging (eg, single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT], positron-emission tomography [PET], and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) is useful because it provides objective quantitative data such as metabolic activity, perfusion, and soft-tissue contrast within tissues and organs. For RT-induced lung, heart, and parotid gland injury, pre- and post-RT SPECT images can be compared with the dose- and volume-dependent nature of regional injury. In the brain, SPECT can detect changes in perfusion and blood flow post-RT, and PET can detect metabolic changes, particularly to regions of the brain that have received doses above 40 to 50 Gy. On MRI, changes in contrast-enhanced images, T(1) and T(2) relaxation times, and pulmonary vascular resistance at different intervals pre- and post-RT show its ability to detect and distinguish different phases of radiation pneumonitis. Similarly, conventional and diffusion-weighted MRI can be used to differentiate between normal tissue edema, necrosis, and tumor in the irradiated brain, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy can measure changes in compounds, indicative of membrane and neuron disruption. The use of functional imaging is a powerful tool for early detection of RT-induced normal tissue injury, which may be related to long-term clinically significant injury.

888,"X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region of two-component heterokaryons of Neurospora crassa. VIII. Dose-dependence of the overall spectrum. There is considerable controversy in the literature concerning the nature of X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in various experimental organisms. To investigate this problem in Neurospora crassa a series of experiments (Webber and de Serres, 1965) was performed to study the induction-kinetics of X-ray-induced mutation in the adenine-3 (ad-3) region of a two-component heterokaryon (H-12). Subsequent genetic analyses (de Serres, 1989a,b,c, 1990a), on a series of 832 mutants recovered in these experiments, have shown that 3 different classes of ad-3 mutants were recovered, namely gene/point mutations, multilocus deletions and multiple-site mutations. Complementation studies with a series of genetic markers that define 21 genetic loci in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent genetic regions have shown that ad-3 mutants classified as multilocus deletions result from the inactivation of a series of loci in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent regions of Linkage Group I, whereas multiple-locus mutations result from combinations of gene/point mutations and multilocus deletions. Analysis of the induction kinetics of these 3 different classes, after completion of the genetic characterization of all mutants (de Serres, 1990b) demonstrated that gene/point mutations increase linearly with X-ray dose, whereas multilocus deletions and multiple-site mutations increase as the square of X-ray dose. Further analysis of allelic complementation among the gene/point mutations at the ad-3B locus (de Serres, 1990c), demonstrated that the spectrum of complementation patterns was dose-dependent: complementing mutants with nonpolarized patterns decreased and noncomplementing mutations increased with increasing X-ray dose. There was little or no change with dose in the frequency of mutants with polarized patterns. In the present report, data from studies published previously have been utilized, along with additional data from the original X-ray experiments (12-5, 12-6, 12-7, and 12-10; see Webber and de Serres, 1965) to develop composite complementation maps of the X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent regions as a function of X-ray dose. This analysis of the overall spectrum of X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region demonstrated marked dose-dependence and provides an explanation for the discrepancies in the literature with regard to specific-locus studies in different experimental organisms.",Excluded,0.94769484

OBJECTIVE: To verify whether the treatment of brain oligometastases with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) plus stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) or surgical resection results in different outcomes.METHODS: Files of patients affected by brain metastases submitted to surgical resection followed by WBRT (group A) or WBRT + SRT (group B) were retrospectively selected for this study. The two treatment groups were matched for the following potential prognostic factors: WBRT schedule, age, gender, performance status, tumor type, number of brain metastases, extra-cerebral metastases, and recursive partitioning analysis class (RPA). The outcomes of patients in both groups were evaluated in terms of toxicity, local control, and overall survival.RESULTS: Total of 97 patients were selected (56 male; 42 female) who were respectively submitted to surgical resection followed by WBRT (group A, n = 50 patients) or WBRT + SRT (Group B, n = 47 patients). Median follow-up was 95 months (range, 8-171 months). The 1-year local control rates were 46.0% and 69.0% respectively. No significant difference in local tumor control was observed between group A and B (p = 0.10). Median overall survival was 15 and 19 months in group A and B, respectively. One-year survival was 56.0% and 62%, respectively. No difference was observed in the two groups (p = 0.40).CONCLUSION: Surgery remains the main therapeutic approach in symptomatic patients; nevertheless, our data support the use of WBRT plus SRT in one or two brain metastases smaller than 3 cm.",Excluded,0.947407

Low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) has been successfully established for decades as an alternative analgesic treatment option for patients suffering from chronic degenerative and inflammatory diseases. In this study, 483 patients were undergoing LDRT for degenerative joint disease of the fingers and thumb at the University Hospital Erlangen between 2004 and 2019. Radiotherapy was applied according to the German guidelines for LDRT. Several impact factors on therapeutic success, such as the age and gender, the number of affected fingers, the single and cumulative dose, as well as the number of series, were investigated. In summary, 70% of the patients showed an improvement of their pain following LDRT. No significant impact was found for the factors age, gender, the number of series or the cumulative dosage. Patients with an involvement of the thumb showed a significantly worse outcome compared to patients with an isolated affection of the fingers. In this cohort, patients receiving a single dose of 0.5 Gy reported a significantly better outcome than patients receiving 1.0 Gy, strongly suggesting a reduction in the total dose. In summary, LDRT is a good alternative treatment option for patients suffering from degenerative and inflammatory joint disease of the fingers.",Excluded,0.9444446
923,"Ionizing radiation induces endothelial transdifferentiation of glioblastoma stem-like cells through the Tie2 signaling pathway. Glioblastomas (GBM) are brain tumors with a poor prognosis despite treatment that combines surgical resection and radio-chemotherapy. These tumors are characterized by abundant vascularization and significant cellular heterogeneity including GBM stem-like cells (GSC) which contribute to tumor aggressiveness, resistance, and recurrence. Recent data has demonstrated that GSC are directly involved in the formation of new vessels via their transdifferentiation into Tumor Derived Endothelial Cells (TDEC). We postulate that cellular stress such as ionizing radiation (IR) could enhance the transdifferentiation of GSC into TDEC. GSC neurospheres isolated from 3 different patients were irradiated or not and were then transdifferentiated into TDEC. In fact, TDEC obtained from irradiated GSC (TDEC IR+) migrate more towards VEGF, form more pseudotubes in Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> in vitro and develop more functional blood vessels in Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> plugs implanted in Nude mice than TDEC obtained from non-irradiated GSC. Transcriptomic analysis allows us to highlight an overexpression of Tie2 in TDEC IR+. All IR-induced effects on TDEC were abolished by using a Tie2 kinase inhibitor, which confirms the role of the Tie2 signaling pathway in this process. Finally, by analyzing Tie2 expression in patient GBMs by immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that the number of Tie2+ vessels increases in recurrent GBM compared with matched untreated tumors. In conclusion, we demonstrate that IR potentiates proangiogenic features of TDEC through the Tie2 signaling pathway, which indicates a new pathway of treatment-induced tumor adaptation. New therapeutic strategies that associate standard treatment and a Tie2 signaling pathway inhibitor should be considered for future trials.",Excluded,0.94430584
754,"Neuroinflammatory changes of the normal brain tissue in cured mice following combined radiation and anti-PD-1 blockade therapy for glioma. The efficacy of combining radiation therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitor blockade to treat brain tumors is currently the subject of multiple investigations and holds significant therapeutic promise. However, the long-term effects of this combination therapy on the normal brain tissue are unknown. Here, we examined mice that were intracranially implanted with murine glioma cell line and became long-term survivors after treatment with a combination of 10 Gy cranial irradiation (RT) and anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade (aPD-1). Post-mortem analysis of the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to tumor implantation showed complete abolishment of hippocampal neurogenesis, but neural stem cells were well preserved in subventricular zone. In addition, we observed a drastic reduction in the number of mature oligodendrocytes in the subcortical white matter. Importantly, this observation was evident specifically in the combined (RT+aPD-1) treatment group but not in the single treatment arm of either RT alone or aPD-1 alone. Elimination of microglia with a small molecule inhibitor of colony stimulated factor-1 receptor (PLX5622) prevented the loss of mature oligodendrocytes. These results identify for the first time a unique pattern of normal tissue changes in the brain secondary to combination treatment with radiotherapy and immunotherapy. The results also suggest a role for microglia as key mediators of the adverse treatment effect.",Excluded,0.9440551

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated after exposure to ionizing radiation and toxic peptides, in mitochondrial metabolism and during aging contribute to damage of cell's structural and functional components and can lead to diseases. Monomers and small oligomers of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, players in Alzheimer's disease, are recently suggested to be involved in damaging of neurons, instead of extracellular Abeta plaques. We demonstrate that externally applied disaggregated Abeta<sub>1-42</sub> peptide interacts preferentially with acidic compartments (lysosomes). We compared standard cell cultivation (21% O<sub>2</sub>) to more physiological cell cultivation (5% O<sub>2</sub>). Cells did not exhibit a dramatic increase in ROS and change in glutathione level upon 4 muM Abeta peptide treatment, whereas exposure to 2 Gy X-rays increased ROS and changed glutathione level and ATP concentration. The occurrence of the 4977 bp deletion in mtDNA and significant protein carbonylation were specific effects of IR and more pronounced at 21% O<sub>2</sub>. An increase in cell death after Abeta peptide treatment or irradiation was unexpectedly restored to the control level or below when both were combined, particularly at 5% O<sub>2</sub>.

943,"Cellular Therapies for Treatment of Radiation Injury: Report from a NIH/NIAID and IRSN Workshop. In recent years, there has been increasing concern over the possibility of a radiological or nuclear incident occurring somewhere in the world. Intelligence agencies frequently report that terrorist groups and rogue nations are seeking to obtain radiological or nuclear weapons of mass destruction. In addition, there exists the real possibility that safety of nuclear power reactors could be compromised by natural (such as the tsunami and subsequent Fukushima accident in Japan in March, 2011) or accidental (Three Mile Island, 1979 and Chernobyl, 1986) events. Although progress has been made by governments around the world to prepare for these events, including the stockpiling of radiation countermeasures, there are still challenges concerning care of patients injured during a radiation incident. Because the deleterious and pathological effects of radiation are so broad, it is desirable to identify medical countermeasures that can have a beneficial impact on several tissues and organ systems. Cellular therapies have the potential to impact recovery and tissue/organ regeneration for both early and late complications of radiation exposure. These therapies, which could include stem or blood progenitor cells, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) or cells derived from other tissues (e.g., endothelium or placenta), have shown great promise in treating other nonradiation injuries to and diseases of the bone marrow, skin, gastrointestinal tract, brain, lung and heart. To explore the potential use of these therapies in the treatment of victims after acute radiation exposure, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases co-sponsored an international workshop in July, 2015 in Paris, France with the Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire. The workshop included discussions of data available from testing in preclinical models of radiation injury to different organs, logistics associated with the practical use of cellular therapies for a mass casualty incident, as well as international regulatory requirements for authorizing such drug products to be legally and readily used in such incidents.

784,"Dose-dependent white matter damage after brain radiotherapy. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain radiotherapy is limited in part by damage to white matter, contributing to neurocognitive decline. We utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with multiple b-values (diffusion weightings) to model the dose-dependency and time course of radiation effects on white matter.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with high-grade gliomas treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy underwent MRI with DTI prior to radiotherapy, and after months 1, 4-6, and 9-11. Diffusion tensors were calculated using three weightings (high, standard, and low b-values) and maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (lambda<sub></sub>), and radial diffusivity (lambda<sub></sub>) were generated. The region of interest was all white matter.RESULTS: MD, lambda<sub></sub>, and lambda<sub></sub> increased significantly with time and dose, with corresponding decrease in FA. Greater changes were seen at lower b-values, except for FA. Time-dose interactions were highly significant at 4-6months and beyond (p<.001), and the difference in dose response between high and low b-values reached statistical significance at 9-11months for MD, lambda<sub></sub>, and lambda<sub></sub> (p<.001, p<.001, p=.005 respectively) as well as at 4-6months for lambda<sub></sub> (p=.04).CONCLUSIONS: We detected dose-dependent changes across all doses, even <10Gy.

During production, animals have problems, sometimes followed by death, due to the high toxicity of the main toxin, crotoxin. Several methods tested to detoxify this toxin often resulted in decreased immunogenicity. Gamma irradiation has proved to be a successful method for crotoxin detoxification without loss of immunogenicity. We have studied the biodistribution of 2 kGy 60Co irradiated crotoxin (iCTX) in mouse tissues. We used both 125I-labeled iCTX or its detection by a specific immunohistochemistry assay (IHA). Both approaches showed similar early excretion of toxins by the kidneys. Higher iCTX uptake was seen in spleen and liver, which are rich in immune responder cells. In contrast to previous reports concerning native crotoxin (nCTX), we failed to detect iCTX in the neuromuscular junction, but both toxins were found on the kidney tubular cell surface, with rapid excretion that was more intense for iCTX. Kupffer cells and splenocyte macrophages presented IHA staining, as shown by the increased uptake of 125I toxin by these organs. No staining was observed in the brain, lung or heart, which also showed very low 125I counts.

BACKGROUND: Currently available information about patients with posterior uveal melanoma treated by plaque radiotherapy is insufficient to determine what to do about eyes that become blind as a consequence of the tumour and its treatment. Should they be enucleated, or is ocular preservation just as good in terms of survival?METHODS: We performed a retrospective survival analysis of secondary enucleation versus ocular preservation in patients with a posterior uveal melanoma treated by plaque radiotherapy whose irradiated eye became completely blind following that treatment. Of the 79 patients who fulfilled defined inclusion criteria, 25 underwent secondary enucleation of the blind eye, and 54 retained their irradiated blind eye.RESULTS: Most of the baseline demographic and tumour-related variables evaluated were similarly distributed between the subgroups. The 5-year, 10-year and 15-year all-cause death rates in the secondary enucleation subgroup were 24.7%, 51.5% and 52.0% respectively, and those in the ocular preservation subgroup were 7.4%, 32.9% and 48.1% respectively. In spite of the apparent slight difference between the curves, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.41, Mantel-Haenszel test).INTERPRETATION: Although a retrospective study of this type has several limitations, our results suggest that secondary enucleation is not likely to substantially improve survival of patients whose irradiated eye becomes totally blind following plaque radiotherapy for choroidal or ciliochoroidal melanoma.",Excluded,0.9431398

The radioresistance of glioblastoma presumably results from the presence of hypoxic cells. In an attempt to overcome this problem, fast neutrons were compared in a controlled pilot study with conventional megavoltage X-rays (photons). Sixty-three patients entered the study between January, 1973 and July, 1976, 30 patients received neutron and 33 received X-ray therapy. The overall mean survival was 11.4 months for those who received photon and 10 months for those who received neutron therapy. Survival rates at 6 and 12 months were 72% and 36%, respectively for photon treated patients, and 77% and 30% for those treated with neutrons. Although neutron therapy did not improve overall survival, examination of the histologic material indicated a considerably greater antitumor effect after neutron therapy than after treatment with photons. In the neutron treated group, at postmortem examination no tumor or only minimal tumor was found in 10 of 12 patients and in one of 4 patients where tissue was obtained from a second craniotomy. In some cases, there was evidence of diffuse damage to normal brain which was in keeping with a clinical syndrome of progressive dementia without localizing signs.

772,"A role for oligodendrocytes in the stabilization of optic axon numbers. Differentiated oligodendrocytes express neurite growth inhibitory proteins at a time when these cells are involved in the myelination of recently formed fiber pathways. As the process of myelination follows the completion of neurite outgrowth and is concurrent with the stabilization of fiber numbers in a pathway, we set out to determine whether myelination and fiber tract stability could be causally related. Myelin formation was prevented in the rat retinofugal pathway by x-irradiating the optic nerves during oligodendrocyte proliferation. Electron microscopic and immunohistochemical analysis of irradiated optic nerves at P15 showed that oligodendrocytes and myelin were virtually absent. Optic fiber numbers were determined at 2 weeks of age throughout the length of normal and x-irradiated nerves. In some cases, normal or irradiation-treated pups were intraocularly injected with FGF 5 d prior to the fiber count in order to promote neurite outgrowth. Axon counts showed that the total fiber number in a myelin-free optic nerve was 10-30% higher than that of a myelinated nerve. Further, fiber numbers fluctuated by as much as 20% along the length of a myelin-free nerve but were relatively constant throughout the length of a myelinated nerve. Treatment of myelinated nerves with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) had no effect on either total fiber numbers or fiber number fluctuation. Conversely, fiber numbers in myelin-free/FGF-treated optic nerves were as much as 40% higher than in normals. Furthermore, total fiber numbers along the length of these nerves fluctuated by up to 34%. These results indicate that, in the absence of myelination, optic fibers are able to form sprouts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded,0.9403842

97,"Temperature dependence of radiation-induced DNA-protein crosslinks formed under hypoxic conditions. Recently, we demonstrated that the oxygen dependence of the formation of DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) in irradiated mammalian cells measured by the alkaline elution technique is the mirror image of the oxygen dependence of radiation-induced cell killing. Consequently, these radiation-induced DPCs could be used to detect hypoxic cells or estimate the hypoxic fraction of cells in solid tumors. Although several techniques, including alkaline elution, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and nitrocellulose filter binding, have been used to measure radiation-induced DPCs, the published reports suggest that the characteristics of these DPCs may depend on both the type of sample irradiated (cellular compared to model systems, oxygenated compared to hypoxic, etc.) and the technique used to measure these radiation-induced DPCs. In the present study, the radiation-induced DPCs measured by our alkaline elution technique with and without proteinase K in the lysis solution were characterized by studying the dependence of their formation on temperature in hypoxic rat 9L brain tumor cells. Exponentially growing 9L rat brain tumor cells were rendered hypoxic at 4degreeC or at 37degreeC and then irradiated with either 7.5 Gy or 15 Gy. The cells were trypsinized at 4degreeC, either immediately after the irradiation or after one half-time of strand break repair at 37degreeC. The results demonstrated that the radiation- induced DPCs produced in 9L cells under hypoxic conditions, measured by our alkaline elution technique after low to moderate radiation doses, required metabolism for their formation, unlike the radiation-induced DPCs reported by others using the GC/MS or nitrocellulose filter binding technique.",Excluded,0.93881774

However, malignant gliomas are highly resistant to ionizing radiation (IR). Recent data suggest migration/invasion is up-regulated as a counterproductive effect of IR. In addition to direct IR effects, non-targeted radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBE), observed beyond the targeted field, can cause significant cell death of the tumour and surrounding normal tissues. Little is known of how RIBE modulates glioma migration/invasion. METHOD(S): RIBE of 10 astrocytes and glioma cells grown as single and cocultures in 2D (monolayer) and 3D matrices was investigated, using media transferred from irradiated cultures and in half-exposed/shielded cultures. Nuclear 53BP1 foci were used as a surrogateDNA damage marker and transwell assays to quantitate migration/invasion. Two3D models were developed to study gliospheres in: (i) collagen matrices with/without astrocytes and (ii) mouse brain slice cultures. RESULT(S): RIBE signals from IR and non-IR glioma cultures both decreased astrocyte clonogenic survival.Weobserved increased DNA damage in astrocyte and glioma bystander cells in 2D and 3D cultures. Bystander cells had increased p38-MAPK, Connexin 43, and COX-2signalling. Direct IR induced an increase and RIBE a decrease in transwell migration. Experiments of gliosphere migration/invasion in 3D models are underway. CONCLUSION(S): These results may have implications for tumour-normal tissue margin interactions. By comparing differential molecular factors involved in the RIBE, we aim to find targets to enhance glioma cell death and inhibit migration/invasion, while preserving normal tissue.",Excluded,0.9348834
990,"Treatment of salivary gland neoplasms with fast neutron radiotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of fast neutron radiotherapy for the treatment of salivary gland neoplasms.DESIGN: Retrospective analysis.SETTING: University of Washington Cancer Center, Neutron Facility, Seattle.PATIENTS: The medical records of 279 patients treated with curative intent using fast neutron radiotherapy at the University of Washington Cancer Center were reviewed. Of the 279 patients, 263 had evidence of gross residual disease at the time of treatment (16 had no evidence of gross residual disease), 141 had tumors of a major salivary gland, and 138 had tumors of minor salivary glands. The median follow-up period was 36 months (range, 1-142 months).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local-regional control, cause-specific survival, and freedom from metastasis.RESULTS: The 6-year actuarial cause-specific survival rate was 67%. Multivariate analysis revealed that low group stage (I-II) disease, minor salivary sites, lack of skull base invasion, and primary disease were associated with a statistically significant improvement in cause-specific survival. The 6-year actuarial local-regional control rate was 59%. Multivariate analysis revealed size 4 cm or smaller, lack of base of skull invasion, prior surgical resection, and no previous radiotherapy to have a statistically significant improved local-regional control. Sixteen patients without evidence of gross residual disease had a 100% 6-year actuarial local-regional control. The 6-year actuarial freedom from metastasis rate was 64%. Factors associated with decreased development of systemic metastases included negative lymph nodes at the time of treatment and lack of base of skull involvement. The 6-year actuarial rate of development of grade 3 or 4 long-term toxicity (using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research on the Treatment of Cancer criteria) was 10%. No patient experienced grade 5 toxic effects.CONCLUSIONS: Neuron radiotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with salivary gland neoplasms who have gross residual disease and achieves excellent local-regional control in patients without evidence of gross disease.",Excluded,0.9324631
177,"Comparative human cellular radiosensitivity: I. The effect of SV40 transformation and immortalisation on the gamma-irradiation survival of skin derived fibroblasts from normal individuals and from ataxia-telangiectasia patients and heterozygotes. We have compared cell killing following 60Co gamma irradiation in 22 primary human fibroblast strains, nine SV40-immortalized human fibroblast lines and seven SV40-transformed pre-crisis human fibroblast cultures. We have examined material from normal individuals, from ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients and from A-T heterozygotes. We have confirmed the greater sensitivity of A-T derived cells to gamma radiation. The distinction between A-T and normal cells is maintained in cells immortalized by SV40 virus but the immortal cells are more gamma radiation resistant than the corresponding primary fibroblasts. Cells transformed by plasmids (pSV3gpt and pSV3neo) expressing SV40 T-antigen, both pre- and post-crisis, show this increased resistance, indicating that it is expression of SV40 T-antigen, rather than immortalization per se which is responsible for the change. We use D0, obtained from a straight line fit, and D, estimated from a multitarget curve, as parameters to compare radiosensitivity. We suggest that both have their advantages; D0 is perhaps more reproducible, but D is more realistic when comparing shouldered and non-shouldered data.",Excluded,0.93074495
449,"Statin Use and Risk of Vascular Events Among Cancer Patients After Radiotherapy to the Thorax, Head, and Neck. Background This study aimed to explore whether statins reduce radiation-induced vascular complications in cancer patients postradiotherapy to the thorax, head, and neck. Methods and Results We conducted a retrospective cohort study within a provincial linked database of 5718 cardiac patients with thorax and head or neck cancer having undergone radiotherapy between 2000 and 2011. One thousand five hundred fifty-two patients were identified as nonstatin users and 4166 as statin users. The primary outcome of interest was the composite of cerebrovascular (transient ischemic attack, and fatal or nonfatal stroke) or cardiovascular events (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction). Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed. The crude event rate was 10.31% for nonusers and 9.03% for statin users (hazard ratio of 0.92 [95% CI 0.76-1.10, P=0.3451]), over a mean time to event/censoring of 534+/-687 days for nonusers and 594+/-706 days for the statin users. After adjusting for age, sex, prior history of stroke/transient ischemic attack or myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and hypertension, statin use postradiotherapy was associated with a nonsignificant 15% relative risk reduction, but a strong trend toward reducing the primary outcome (hazard ratio=0.85 95% CI 0.69-1.04, P=0.0811). The use of statins was associated with a significant reduction of 32% for the outcome of stroke alone (hazard ratio=0.68, 95% CI 0.48-0.98, P=0.0368). Conclusions Statin use post radiation therapy was associated with a significant reduction in stroke, with a trend toward significantly reducing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.",Excluded,0.9307177

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate the diffusivity of different components of radiation-induced cerebral necrosis with the hypothesis that the diffusivity of the various components is elevated to different degrees.METHODS: Twenty-two patients (18 men, 4 women, aged 34-72 years) with radiation injury to the temporal lobes after radiation therapy (RT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma with diagnosis confirmed on serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were studied with coronal T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Using three diffusion directions for diffusion-weighted MRI, the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of the enhanced component, the cystic or liquefied component, and the edema component were measured.RESULTS: ADCs of all components of RT-induced cerebral necrosis (154 +/- 21.6 x 10(-5) mm2/s for contrast-enhanced component; 188 +/- 47.4 x 10(-5) mm2/s for cystic/liquefied component; 177 +/- 35.4 x 10(-5) mm2/s for edema component) were all significantly higher (P<0.00001) than ADC of the normal frontal lobe white matter (82 +/- 12.4 x 10(-5) mm2/s). The ADC of the enhanced component was significantly lower than that of the cystic/liquefied component (P=0.0096) and the edema component (P=0.003). A significantly lower ADC was shown in the enhanced component in temporal lobes showing both short-term morphologic deterioration (P=0.024) and occurrence of deterioration on long-term follow-up (P=0.04) compared with the temporal lobes that showed improvement or stable morphology.CONCLUSIONS: ADCs of the contrast-enhanced component, cystic/liquefied component, and edema in RT-induced cerebral necrosis was significantly higher than in normal brain parenchyma.

1111,"Perfusion magnetic resonance imaging changes in normal appearing brain tissue after radiotherapy in glioblastoma patients may confound longitudinal evaluation of treatment response. The aim of this study was assess acute and early delayed radiation-induced changes in normal-appearing brain tissue perfusion as measured with perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the dependence of these changes on the fractionated radiotherapy (FRT) dose level. Seventeen patients with glioma WHO grade III-IV treated with FRT were included in this prospective study, seven were excluded because of inconsistent FRT protocol or missing examinations. Dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI and contrast-enhanced 3D-T1-weighted (3D-T1w) images were acquired prior to and in average (standard deviation): 3.1 (3.3), 34.4 (9.5) and 103.3 (12.9) days after FRT. Pre-FRT 3D-T1w images were segmented into white- and grey matter. Cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps were calculated and co-registered patient-wise to pre-FRT 3D-T1w images. Seven radiation dose regions were created for each tissue type: 0-5 Gy, 5-10 Gy, 10-20 Gy, 20-30 Gy, 30-40 Gy, 40-50 Gy and 50-60 Gy. Mean CBV and CBF were calculated in each dose region and normalised (nCBV and nCBF) to the mean CBV and CBF in 0-5 Gy white- and grey matter reference regions, respectively. Regional and global nCBV and nCBF in white- and grey matter decreased after FRT, followed by a tendency to recover. The response of nCBV and nCBF was dose-dependent in white matter but not in grey matter. Our data suggest that radiation-induced perfusion changes occur in normal-appearing brain tissue after FRT. This can cause an overestimation of relative tumour perfusion using dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI, and can thus confound tumour treatment evaluation.

Glioblastoma is associated with poor prognosis with a median survival of one year. High doses of ionizing radiation is the only established exogenous risk factor. To explore new potential biological risk factors for glioblastoma, we investigated alterations in metabolite concentrations in pre-diagnosed serum samples from glioblastoma patients diagnosed up to 22 years after sample collection, and undiseased controls. The study points out a latent biomarker for future glioblastoma consisting of nine metabolites (gamma-tocopherol, alpha-tocopherol, erythritol, erythronic acid, myo-inositol, cystine, 2-keto-L-gluconic acid, hypoxanthine and xanthine) involved in antioxidant metabolism. We detected significantly higher serum concentrations of alpha-tocopherol (p=0.0018) and gamma-tocopherol (p=0.0009) in future glioblastoma cases. Compared to their matched controls, the cases showed a significant average fold increase of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol levels: 1.2 for alpha-T (p=0.018) and 1.6 for gamma-T (p=0.003). These tocopherol levels were associated with a glioblastoma odds ratio of 1.7 (alpha-T, 95% CI:1.0-3.0) and 2.1 (gamma-T, 95% CI:1.2-3.8).

Radiation exposure represents a serious hindrance for long-term interplanetary missions because of the high uncertainty on risk coefficients, and to the lack of simple countermeasures. Even if uncertainties in risk assessment will be reduced in the next few years, there is little doubt that appropriate countermeasures have to be taken to reduce the exposure or the biological damage produced by cosmic radiation. In addition, it is necessary to provide effective countermeasures against solar particle events, which can produce acute effects, even life threatening, for inadequately protected crews. Strategies that may prove to be effective in reducing exposure, or the effects of the irradiation, include shielding, administration of drugs or dietary supplements to reduce the radiation effects, crew selection based on a screening of individual radiation sensitivity.

Within the first day postflight, the magnitude of response to an applied translation was on average three times greater than for controls. The reduced gravitational acceleration in orbit apparently resulted in an upregulation of the sensitivity of utricular afferents. By 30 h postflight, responses were statistically similar to control.

BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody, is a new treatment approach for radionecrosis. In our study, we compared the prophylactic and therapeutic usage of a promising agent, ramipril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), with that of bevacizumab for reducing radiation-induced brain injury after high-dose stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).METHODS: A total of 60 Wistar rats were used. The rats were irradiated with a single dose of 50 Gy using a Leksell Gamma Knife device. Bevacizumab and ramipril were administered in the prophylactic protocol (starting the first day of SRS) and in the therapeutic protocol (starting the fourth week of SRS). Their usage was continued until 12 weeks, and the right frontal lobes of the rats were examined histologically (hematoxylin and eosin stain) and immunohistochemically (hypoxia-inducible factor [HIF]-1alpha, VEGF, and CD31 antibody expression).RESULTS: The expression of VEGF, HIF-1alpha, and CD31 had significantly increased at 12 weeks after SRS compared with the control group. The addition of bevacizumab or ramipril to SRS significantly mitigated the histological severity of radiation injury and the expression of VEGF, HIF-1alpha, and CD31. However, the prophylactic use of bevacizumab and ramipril seemed to be more effective than therapeutic administration. Our results also revealed that the greatest benefit was achieved with the use of prophylactic administration of bevacizumab compared with other treatment protocols.CONCLUSIONS: Ramipril might be a promising agent for patients with radionecrosis.

Background and purpose: Proton therapy is increasingly used to treat primary brain tumors. There is concern for higher rates of pseudoprogression (PsP) after protons compared to photons. The purposes of this study are to compare the rate of PsP after proton vs. photon therapy for grade II and III gliomas and to identify factors associated with the development of PsP. Material(s) and Method(s): Ninety-nine patients age >18 years with grade II or III glioma treated with photons or protons were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, IDH and 1p19q status, and treatment factors were analyzed for association with PsP, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Sixty-five patients were treated with photons and 34 with protons. Among those with oligodendroglioma, PsP developed in 6/42 photon-treated patients (14.3%) and 4/25 proton-treated patients (16%, p = 1.00). Among those with astrocytoma, PsP developed in 3/23 photon-treated patients (13%) and 1/9 proton-treated patients (11.1%, p = 1.00). There was no difference in PsP rate based on radiation type, radiation dose, tumor grade, 1p19q codeletion, or IDH status.

Introduction: It is well known that a significant proportion of newly diagnosed acoustic neuromas (ANs) do not seem to change much on scans. There are less data on what happens to ANs that have initially been shown to grow on scans if left untreated. Radiation treatments can arrest growth of newly diagnosed ANs, but again, data are sparse that look specifically at the subset of ANs that have shown documented growth before radiation treatments. We reviewed our local experience with growing ANs, both what happens if left untreated and the control rate with radiation treatments. Result(s): Of those ANs that have been documented to have grown, 65% continued to grow, 30% stopped growing, and 5% decreased in size. After a mean follow-up of 60 months, 17% of the growing ANs treated with radiation continued to grow, 24% remained stable, and 59% reduced in size. Conclusion(s): There appears to be a subset of ANs that, despite showing initial growth, can stabilize in follow-up, and that radiation treatment does work but much less effectively when only those tumors that have documented prior growth are reviewed. There may be some support for the idea that radiation may be taking credit for what, in part, is the natural history of these tumors.",Excluded,0.79668254

PURPOSE: To analyze the incidence of and risk factors for clinically significant radiation necrosis (cRN) in adult cranial oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas treated with proton or photon therapy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 2007 and 2015, 160 patients with grade 2 or 3 oligodendrogliomas (with 1p/19q codeletion, n = 53) or astrocytomas (without 1p/19q codeletion, n = 107) were treated with proton (n = 37) or photon (n = 123) therapy. Clinically significant radiation necrosis (RN) was defined as symptomatic RN or asymptomatic RN that resulted in surgery or bevacizumab administration. The cumulative incidence was calculated using competing risks. Risk factors were identified using Cox proportional hazards.RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 28.5 months, cRN developed in 18 patients (proton, 6; photon, 12). The 2-year cumulative incidence of cRN for proton and photon therapy was 18.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.5%-33.8%) and 9.7% (95% CI, 5.1%-16%), respectively (P = .16). On multivariate analysis, risk factors for cRN included oligodendroglioma (hazard ratio [HR], 3.57; 95% CI, 1.38-9.25; P = .009) and higher prescription dose (in gray relative biological equivalents [GyRBE]) (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.61; P = .015). The 2-year cumulative incidence of cRN in oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas was 24.2% and 6.2%, respectively (P = .01). The relative volume (percentage) of brain receiving 60 GyRBE was a significant dosimetric predictor of cRN in oligodendrogliomas (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.20; P = .005).CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that 1p/19q codeleted oligodendroglioma was a significant risk factor associated with cRN and the relative volume (percentage) of brain receiving 60 GyRBE was an important dosimetric predictor of cRN for oligodendroglioma patients. There is insufficient evidence at this time to conclude a significant difference in the incidence of cRN between proton and photon therapy.",Excluded,0.7913334
230,"MMP-2 siRNA inhibits radiation-enhanced invasiveness in glioma cells. BACKGROUND: Our previous work and that of others strongly suggests a relationship between the infiltrative phenotype of gliomas and the expression of MMP-2. Radiation therapy, which represents one of the mainstays of glioma treatment, is known to increase cell invasion by inducing MMP-2. Thus, inhibition of MMP-2 provides a potential means for improving the efficacy of radiotherapy for malignant glioma.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have tested the ability of a plasmid vector-mediated MMP-2 siRNA (p-MMP-2) to modulate ionizing radiation-induced invasive phenotype in the human glioma cell lines U251 and U87. Cells that were transfected with p-MMP-2 with and without radiation showed a marked reduction of MMP-2 compared to controls and pSV-transfected cells. A significant reduction of proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis of cells transfected with p-MMP-2 and in combination with radiation was observed compared to controls. Western blot analysis revealed that radiation-enhanced levels of VEGF, VEGFR-2, pVEGFR-2, p-FAK, and p-p38 were inhibited with p-MMP-2-transfected cells. TUNEL staining showed that radiation did not induce apoptosis in U87 and U251 cells while a significant increase in TUNEL-positive cells was observed when irradiated cells were simultaneously transfected with p-MMP-2 as compared to controls. Intracranial tumor growth was predominantly inhibited in the animals treated with p-MMP-2 alone or in combination with radiation compared to controls.CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: MMP-2 inhibition, mediated by p-MMP-2 and in combination with radiation, significantly reduced tumor cell migration, invasion, angiogenesis and tumor growth by modulating several important downstream signaling molecules and directing cells towards apoptosis. Taken together, our results demonstrate the efficacy of p-MMP-2 in inhibiting radiation-enhanced tumor invasion and progression and suggest that it may act as a potent adjuvant for radiotherapy in glioma patients.",Excluded,0.77159095

The SVZ was delineated, and dose-volume histograms were calculated and extracted. Tumors were classified according to their contact with the SVZ. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis, and univariable and multivariable Cox regression (MVA) were used to determine prognostic effects on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: Median PFS of the study group was 7.2 months; median OS was 15.1 months. In MVA (with mean dose to the ipsilateral SVZ as a continuous covariable), PFS was significantly lower for patients with a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) < 70% and without MGMT promoter methylation. Factors prognostic for shorter OS were old age, lower KPS, unmethylated MGMT status, SVZ contact and biopsy instead of subtotal- or gross total resection. There was no significant correlation between survival and SVZ dose.CONCLUSION: In this cohort, an increased mean dose to the ipsilateral or contralateral SVZ did not correlate with improved survival in irradiated GBM patients in MVA. Patients whose tumor directly involved the SVZ showed worse OS in MVA.",Excluded,0.76862365

429,"Neurotransmitter receptors in brain regions of acrylamide-treated rats. II: Effects of extended exposure to acrylamide. Acrylamide was administered orally to 6 week old male rats in ten doses, spread over a two week period. At the two lower doses (5 and 10 mg/kg, total dose 50 and 100 mg/kg) effects on neurotransmitter receptor sites appeared confirmed to the striatum where both the dopamine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors exhibited enhanced binding twenty four hours after the last acrylamide dose. Other receptor sites within the frontal cortex, cerebellum, and medulla were not significantly altered. At the highest dose (20 mg/kg, given ten times), increases were also found for frontal cortical serotonin, medullary glycine, and cerebellar GABA receptor sites. The only unaffected receptor found was the cortical site for benzodiazepene. One week after the final acrylamide dose, the intensity of all ligands studied was not significantly different in treated and control groups. Thus, effects appeared reversible. Since striatal membrane protein concentration was reduced by treatment with rats with acrylamide, the observed increase in activity of muscarinic receptors could be best accounted for in terms of loss of striatal non-receptor protein rather than increased binding. However, the magnitude of increased striatal <sup>3</sup>H-spiroperidol binding in treated animals suggested an increase in overall binding capacity. An effect on dopamine neutrons was also suggested by a decreased responsiveness to apomorphine in rats treated with acrylamide at 10 mg/kg for 10 successive days; however, the effect had dissipated by 8 days after the final injection of acrylamide.",Excluded,0.7494564
425,"I-125 brachytherapy for choroidal melanoma photographic and angiographic abnormalities: the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study: COMS Report No. 30. OBJECTIVES: (1) To summarize the protocol used for grading features of postradiation abnormalities from fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms of patients enrolled in the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS); (2) to document the prevalence of features of interest in the posterior pole of these eyes during 8 years of follow-up; and (3) to investigate baseline patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics associated with posterior pole features.DESIGN: Observational case series within a randomized, multicenter clinical trial.PARTICIPANTS: We evaluated 650 patients who were assigned to and received iodine-125 brachytherapy in the COMS for medium-sized tumors.METHODS: Color fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms were taken at baseline and 2, 5, and 8 years; 30 features were graded according to a standard protocol.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence at selected time intervals of fundus photographic features associated with retinopathy and optic neuropathy.RESULTS: The percentage of patients with >/=1 feature of interest was 49.2% at baseline, 84.4% at 2 years, 91.2% at 5 years, and 90.7% at 8 years. The most frequent findings across all follow-up examinations were macular microaneurysms (75.6% of examinations), macular angiographic leakage (75.1%), and optic disc hyperfluorescence (62.8%). The median number of features present increased significantly with each follow-up to a maximum of 7 features at 8 years. The prevalence of neovascularization of the disc at 5 years was 5.2%. The prevalence of optic neuropathy at 5 years was 27.4%. Prognostic factors for more prevalent and severe posterior pole abnormalities were diabetes, tumor location close to both optic nerve and foveal avascular zone, and greater dose of radiation to the foveola and optic nerve head.CONCLUSIONS: The amount and severity of retinopathy and optic neuropathy after iodine-125 brachytherapy increased through 8 years of follow-up. Assessment of photographs and angiograms taken in accord with a standard protocol provided reliable estimates of rates of development of features of retinopathy and optic neuropathy in eyes treated using the COMS brachytherapy protocol. Our findings support earlier reports that tumor factors in addition to radiation treatment may contribute to posterior pole abnormalities.FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The authors have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.",Excluded,0.746101
844,"Radiation therapy for glomus tumors of the temporal bone. The treatment of glomic tumors has been controversial since its first description. It can be done with surgery, radiotherapy or just expectation. Aim(s): The objective of this paper was to evaluate the effectiveness and complications of radiotherapy. Study design: clinical with transversal cohort. Material(s) and Method(s): It was made a retrospective review in the charts of the patients with glomus jugulare tumors treated with radiotherapy. Disease control was determined by (1) no progression of symptoms or cranial nerve dysfunction or (2) no progression of the lesion in radiological follow-up. It was also evaluated the follow-up period and the sequelae of the treatment. Result(s): Twelve patients were included, 8 of then women. The follow-up period was from 3 to 35 years, with a media of 11,6 years. The main symptoms were: hearing loss, pulsate tinnitus, dizziness and vertigo. The signs were pulsate retrotympanic mass, facial palsy and cofosis. The tumors were staged using Fisch's classification. The radiotherapy was performed with linear accelerator with dose ranging from 4500-5500 in 4-6 weeks. In the follow-up period were possible to identify sequelaes like dermatitis, meatal stenosis, cofosis and facial palsy. Discussion(s): The signs and symptoms were the same found in the medical literature. The type and dosages of the radiotherapy were also the same of others reports. All patients had improvement of the symptoms and only one was not considered as having disease controlled. Complications were, in general, minor complications, with exception of the cofosis and facial palsy. Conclusion(s): Radiotherapy is a viable alternative to treatment of these tumors because their good response and low level of complications. It should be considered specially in advanced tumors where a surgical procedure could bring a high level of morbidity.",Excluded,0.74525213

Objective: In this study, we compared the effects of combination of celecoxib, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and hippocampal sparing, IMRT with hippocampal sparing and IMRT only on cognitive function, life quality and therapeutic effects in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): From June 2015 to December 2016, 177 cases with NPC in our hospital were finally enrolled and randomly divided into three groups: IMRT only group (I group), hippocampal sparing IMRT (H group) and celecoxib combined with hippocampal sparing IMRT group (Ce group). Cognitive function and life quality were evaluated three months after treatment via Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Quality of life questionnaire (QLQ C30) respectively. Indicators for therapeutic effects including complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), adverse reactions, recurrence and metastasis of tumor and serum tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of patients were also compared. Result(s): Before the intervention, there was no difference in cognitive function score among all the patients (P=0.876). After the treatment, no significant difference was found for RR among groups (P=0.245), however, patients in the Ce group showed the highest cognitive function score (P<0.001); the differences in adverse reactions including dry mouth (P=0.026, Ce vs. H; P=0.000, Ce vs. I; P=0.000, H vs. I), oral mucositis (P=0.060, Ce vs. H; P=0.008, Ce vs. I; P=0.396, H vs. I), skin reaction (P=0.654, Ce vs. H; P=0.027, Ce vs. I; P=0.065, H vs. I), irradiation otitis media (P=0.097, Ce vs. H; P=0.009, Ce vs. I; P=0.051, H vs. I) had statistical significance, and their incidence rates in Ce group were lowest. Meanwhile, recurrence and metastasis were less in the Ce group although the differences were insignificant (P=0.302 and 0.638). The serum level of CEA was notably lower in Ce group (P=0.031, Ce vs. H; P=0.020, Ce vs. I; P=0.512, H vs. I). Life quality scores about cognitive function and role function of H group and Ce group were higher than that of I group while Ce group was the highest (Cognitive function: P=0.020, Ce vs. H; P=0.015, Ce vs. I and P=0.023, H vs. I; role function: P=0.039, Ce vs. H; P=0.011, Ce vs. I and P=0.031, H vs. I). Conclusion(s): Celecoxib combined with hippocampus sparing IMRT for the treatment of NPC patients could drastically alleviate cognitive dysfunction, improve life quality and reduce the occurrence of adverse events compared with hippocampal sparing IMRT and IMRT only.

The Central Brain Tumor Registry in the USA has made a complete description of primary brain tumors available to researchers. International data suggest that environmental components in the etiology of brain tumors are likely to be widely dispersed by geography and demographic subgroups. There are few proven causes of brain tumors: high-dose ionizing radiation, inherited genetic syndromes and AIDs-related brain lymphomas. Promising avenues of research include the role of immune function, genetic components in families, metabolic and DNA-repair pathways and neurocarcinogen exposures.

We studied 12 thymectomized patients affected with chronic generalized severe myasthenia gravis. All patients had been totally or partially refractory to prolonged oral treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, and most had contra-indications for these drugs. Low-dose (1.8- to 2.3-Gy total dose) TBI was administered in single, 0.1-Gy doses, two to three times per week. TBI was well tolerated and was associated with objective clinical improvement in six patients, lasting more than 2 years in five. In addition, TBI produced a long-lasting lymphopenia with a pronounced decrease of T CD4+ lymphocytes; T CD8+ lymphocytes were almost unchanged over the 2 years of the study. CD16+ and CD20+ lymphocytes, after an initial decrease, increased above baseline. TBI was also associated with decreased anti-AChR antibody titer. The decrease of lymphocyte count and of anti-AChR antibody titer was more pronounced in the patients who improved, suggesting that lymphopenia and immunosuppression may have contributed to clinical improvement.",Excluded,0.6464547
880,"Vision loss following high-dose proton-based radiotherapy for skull-base chordoma and chondrosarcoma. BACKGROUND & PURPOSE: Dose escalation for skull-based chordoma and chondrosarcoma can put critical adjacent structures at risk, specifically the anterior optic pathway. We report the incidence of vision loss following high-dose conformal proton-based radiotherapy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed patients with skull-base chordoma or chondrosarcoma treated with proton-based therapy between 2007 and 2018. We analyzed 148 patients and 283 individual eyes with functional vision at baseline who received a minimum 30GyRBE to 0.1 cm<sup>3</sup> of the anterior optic pathway. Eyes were classified as ""functionally blind"" if visual acuity was 20/200 or worse. Kaplan-Meier and normal tissue complication probability modeling were used to establish the relationship between radiation dose and risk of functional vision loss.RESULTS: At last follow-up, 110 of 148 patients were alive with no evidence of disease progression. With a median follow-up of 4.1 years (range, 0.5-12.8), 5 eyes in 3 patients developed functional blindness, with 2 patients developing bilateral blindness. Median time to blindness was 15.2 months. The 5-year incidence of vision loss was 2.1% (95% CI: 0.9-4.9%). On univariate analysis, development of blindness was associated with presence of multiple medical comorbidities (p = 0.0040). While there were no events with a maximum dose < 60GyRBE delivered to the anterior optic pathway, the crude rate was 3.6% over 60GyRBE, with all events occurring between 60-65GyRBE.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high radiotherapy dose delivered to patients with skull-base chordoma and chondrosarcoma, the rate of vision loss is low and no events occurred in those who received a maximum dose under 60GyRBE.",Excluded,0.63787717
253,"Adenoviral vector-mediated gene transfer: Timing of wild-type p53 gene expression in vivo and effect of tumor transduction on survival in a rat glioma brachytherapy model. Objective. This study sought to investigate modification of the radiation response in a rat 9L brain tumor model in vivo by the wild-type p53 gene (wtp53). Determination of the timing and dose of radiation therapy required the assessment of the duration of the effect of wtp53 expression on 9L tumors after in vivo transfection. Methods. Anesthetized male F-344 rats each were stereotactically inoculated with 4 x 10<sup>4</sup> 9L gliosarcoma cells through a skull screw into the cerebrum in the right frontal region. Twelve-day-old tumors were inoculated through the screw with recombinant adenoviral vectors under isoflurane anaesthesia: control rats with Ad5/RSV/GL2 (carrying the luciferase gene), and study rats with Ad5CMV-p53 (carrying the wtp53 gene). Brain tumors removed at specific times after transfection were measured, homogenized, and lysed and wtp53 expression determined by Western blot analysis. Four groups of nine rats were, subsequently, implanted with iodine-125 seeds 15 days post-tumor inoculation to give a minimum tumor dose of 40 or 60 Gy. Results. We demonstrated transfer of wtp53 into rat 9L tumors in vivo using the Ad5CMV-p53 vector. The expression of wtp53 was demonstrated to be maximum between days 1 and 3 post-vector inoculation. Tumors expressing wtp53 were smaller than controls transfected with Ad5/RSV/GL2 but this difference was not statistically significant. Radiation made a significant difference to the survival of tumor-bearing rats. Moreover, wtp53 expression conferred a significant additional survival advantage. Conclusion. The expression of wtp53 significantly improves the survival of irradiated tumor-bearing rats in our model.",Excluded,0.6232243

1046,"Risk of Hippocampal Metastases in Small Cell Lung Cancer: Implications for Hippocampal Sparing Cranial Irradiation. Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) decreases the incidence of brain metastases (BMs) and can improve overall survival. However whole brain radiation therapy is associated with a decline in neurocognitive function. Hippocampal-sparing whole brain radiation therapy (HS-WBRT) aims to minimise damage to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) within the hippocampus and reduce the toxicity of PCI, although there may be an increased risk of treatment failure in the hippocampal region. The incidence of hippocampal metastases was investigated in patients with BMs from SCLC to evaluate the feasibility of HS-WBRT in this population. Method(s): Patients with SCLC presenting between 2000 and 2016 with BMs at presentation or during their disease course without previous cranial irradiation were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Hippocampal metastases (HMs) were defined as metastases within the hippocampus and a 5-mm radial expansion (hippocampus avoidance zone, according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0933 atlas). The rate of hippocampal metastases and associated clinical features were analysed. Result(s): One hundred and twenty eligible patients with a total of 754 brain metastases were identified. In 67 (55.8%) patients BMs were detected at diagnosis of SCLC and in 53 (44.2%) patients BMs developed later without previous PCI. The median number of metastases was 3, and 27 (22.5%) patients had a single BM. There were 22 (18.3%) patients with hippocampal metastases. A total of 23 (3.1%) metastases involved the hippocampal avoidance area. On logistic regression analysis, the number of brain metastases was an independent risk factor for HMs. Conclusion(s): The overall incidence of hippocampal metastases in our cohort of SCLC patients is high. As HS-WBRT may increase the risk of treatment failure in the spared region, prospective randomised trials are encouraged.

Mice were treated daily with [3H]MPTP (30 mg/kg, 1 uCi, s.c.) for 1, 3, and 10 days to determine the fate and localization of tritiated compounds. An untreated mouse was housed either in the same cage (""cage-mate control"") or in an adjacent cage separated by mesh-wire (""near-neighbor control""). The radioactivity measured in blood, brain, liver, and remaining body of [3H]MPTP-treated mice was dependent on the total dose of the drug the animals received and did not vary with the type of tissue analyzed. Significant amounts of radioactivity were found in the tissues of the ""cage-mate control"" mice, but not of the ""near-neighbor control"" mice. The route of transmission appears to be through the urine, as the urine of [3H]MPTP-treated mice was highly radioactive after the drug injection. Only traces of radioactivity were found in their feces and there was no increase in the background radiation in the environment of the cages, indicating that the tritiated compounds were not exhaled.
