872,"Relationships between ionizing radiation, bone marrow transplantation and leukemogenesis Studies of the relationships between ionizing radiation, bone marrow transplantation and leukemogenesis were carried out in 343 LACA mice. The recipients (female) were given whole-body irradiation with 7 or 8 Gy of Co-60 gamma-rays, while the donors (male) were given whole-body irradiation with 3, 1.5, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05 and 0 Gy of Co-60 gamma-rays. Each recipient was intravenously infused with 1-3 X 10(7) of the mixed marrow cells of donors. In the result, the average incidence of surviving over 1 month was 86% in the recipients. Myelocytic leukemia developed in all the transplanted groups, the average incidence being 88.5%. Leukemia was observed in 1.5-2.5 months after transplantation in the recipients receiving marrow cells from donors exposed to 3 Gy, but in 5-8 months in other groups. It was demonstrated by the analysis of Y-chromosome that the leukemic cells were derived from the donor's marrow cells. The results suggest that marrow transplantation for the mice irradiated by Co-60 gamma-rays of lethal dose can protect them from death, but promote the development of leukemia. Radiation can induce production of factors which lead to leukemic transformation of engrafted normal marrow cells in the irradiated mice; the direct damage of DNA caused by radiation is not the unique factor that gives rise to leukemia.",Excluded,0.9659969
414,"X-irradiation removes endogenous primordial germ cells (PGCs) and increases germline transmission of donor PGCs in chimeric chickens Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are embryonic precursors of germline cells with potential applications in genetic conservation, transgenic animal production and germline stem cell research. These lines of research would benefit from improved germline transmission of transplanted PGCs in chimeric chickens. We therefore evaluated the effects of pretransplant X-irradiation of recipient embryos on the efficacy of germline transmission of donor PGCs in chimeric chickens. Intact chicken eggs were exposed to X-ray doses of 3, 6 and 9 Gy (dose rate = 0.12 Gy/min) after 52 h of incubation. There was no significant difference in hatching rate between the 3-Gy-irradiated group and the nonirradiated control group (40.0 vs. 69.6%), but the hatching rate in the 6-Gy-irradiated group (28.6%) was significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.05). No embryos irradiated with 9 Gy of X-rays survived to hatching. X-irradiation significantly reduced the number of endogenous PGCs in the embryonic gonads at stage 27 in a dose-dependent manner compared with nonirradiated controls. The numbers of endogenous PGCs in the 3-, 6- and 9-Gy-irradiated groups were 21.0, 9.6 and 4.6% of the nonirradiated control numbers, respectively. Sets of 100 donor PGCs were subsequently transferred intravascularly into embryos irradiated with 3 Gy X-rays and nonirradiated control embryos. Genetic cross-test analysis revealed that the germline transmission rate in the 3-Gy-irradiated group was significantly higher than in the control group (27.5 vs. 5.6%; P<0.05). In conclusion, X-irradiation reduced the number of endogenous PGCs and increased the germline transmission of transferred PGCs in chimeric chickens.",Excluded,0.96593285
813,"Endocrine function and reproductive impairment in an irradiated population of the lizard Uta stansburiana This study describes gonadal changes in lizards (Uta stansburiana) exposed to chronic low levels of gamma radiation (1.5-10 R/day) under field conditions and attempts to evaluate endocrine involvement in these changes. Reproductive impairment in irradiated males is demonstrated during the breeding season by reduced testes weights and by seminiferous tubules devoid of germ cells. Ultrastructural morphology of Leydig cells, plasma testosterone levels, and developed accessory sex structures indicate normal steroidogenesis in such males; cytology of the pituitary gonadotropes and pituitary gonadotropin content indicate normal gonadotropin levels. These findings suggest that low levels of radiation affect the spermatogenic process directly, rather than through damage to the pituitary. Comparable irradiation causes complete resorption of ovarian tissue in some female Uta. The oviducts are atrophic and the pituitary gonadotropes hyperactive. Resemblance of gonadotropes to those of castrated animals and reduced pituitary hormone content suggest elevated levels of gonadotropin production, probably due to the absence of ovarian steroid feedback in affected animals. The continued mitotic activity of oogonia in adult reptiles and their limited number contribute to the vulnerability of germinal tissue in irradiated female lizards. Destruction of the germ cells is accompanied by resorption of all ovarian tissue including steroidogenic elements. Thus, in females as in males, radiation appears to damage gametogenesis rather than pituitary function.",Excluded,0.96592426
944,"Muscle injury following experimental intraoperative irradiation The paraaortic region of beagle dogs was irradiated to 15 to 55 Gy intraoperative irradiation, 10 to 47.5 Gy intraoperative irradiation following 50 Gy external beam irradiation in 25 fractions, or 50 to 80 Gy external beam irradiation in 30 fractions. Six MeV electrons were used for intraoperative irradiation, and external beam irradiation was done using photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. The psoas muscle in the irradiation field was examined histomorphometrically 2 or 5 years after irradiation. The percentage of muscle fibers and capillaries decreased, whereas the percentage of connective tissue increased with increased dose for both intraoperative irradiation only and intraoperative irradiation plus external beam irradiation. The dose causing a 50% decrease in the percentage of muscle fibers was 21.2 Gy and 33.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone, and 22.9 Gy and 25.2 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. The ED50 for severe vessel lesions was 19.2 Gy and 25.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone and 16.0 Gy and 18.0 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. External beam irradiation alone caused a slight decrease in percentage of muscle fibers with increased dose, and vessel lesions were infrequent or mild. Radiation-induced muscle injury was characterized by loss of muscle fibers, decreased fiber size, severe vessel lesions, hemorrhage, inflammation, coagulation necrosis, and fibrosis. These histopathologic characteristics distinguish this muscle injury from that caused by neurogenic atrophy. These data indicate that radiation-induced muscle injury most likely was caused by injury of the supporting vasculature. The lesions produced were largely a function of the single intraoperative dose rather than the external beam fractionated doses. Furthermore, it appears that 20 to 25 Gy intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation may be near the maximum tolerated dose by sublumbar musculature and its supporting vasculature.",Excluded,0.9659227
79,"Arterial Stiffness as a Biomarker of Radiation-Induced Carotid Atherosclerosis Arterial stiffness is thought to be a precursor to atherosclerosis. Conventional arterial stiffness parameters as potential biomarkers of radiation-induced damage were investigated. Patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy >=2 years previously to one side of the neck were included. The unirradiated side was the internal control. Beta stiffness index (B) and elastic modulus (Ep) were used to assess arterial stiffness and were measured in proximal, mid, and distal common carotid artery (CCA) and compared with the corresponding unirradiated segments. Fifty patients (68% male; median age 58 years; interquartile range 50-62) were included. Mean +/- standard deviation maximum doses to irradiated and unirradiated arteries were 53 +/- 13 and 1.9 +/- 3.7 Gy, respectively. Differences in B were not significant. Significant differences in Ep were demonstrated-proximal CCA: 1301 +/- 1223 versus 801 +/- 492 (P < .0001), mid CCA: 1064 +/- 818 versus 935.5 +/- 793 (P < .0001), and distal CCA: 1267 +/- 1084 versus 775.3 +/- 551.9 (P < .0001). Surgery had no impact on arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness is increased in irradiated arteries, in keeping with radiation-induced damage. Prospective data may show an association between arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis in this setting. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2015.",Excluded,0.96590805
696,"Toxoplasma gondii: effect of sublethal irradiation on host resistance in mice The effect of sublethal whole-body irradiation (500 rad) on the resistance of C57BL/6 mice to infection with Toxoplasma gondii was studied. Mice irradiated 1 day before or 4 days after infection via the intraperitoneal or peroral route with cysts of the mildly virulent ME49 strain of T. gondii died sooner than did unirradiated controls. The time to death of irradiated mice was suggestive of impaired acquired immunity. Irradiated mice infected intraperitoneally with T. gondii cysts exhibited reduced levels of Thy-1+CD4-CD8- cells, less natural killer cell activity against YAC-1 targets, and lower levels of IFN-gamma than controls. Numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells were also lower in infected, irradiated mice. Irradiated mice immunized with a vaccine strain of T. gondii, and later challenged with a highly virulent strain, were less well protected than unirradiated controls. Irradiation appears to impair early, CD4(+)- and CD(8+)-independent resistance to T. gondii, as well as acquisition of immunity.",Excluded,0.965879
76,"Carotid intima-medial thickness as a marker of radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis PURPOSE: Arterial thickening is a precursor to atherosclerosis. Carotid intima-medial thickness (CIMT), a measure of arterial thickening, is a validated surrogate for prediction of cerebrovascular events. This study investigates CIMT as an early marker of radiation-induced carotid artery damage., MATERIALS/METHODS: Head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) (minimum dose of 50 Gy) to one side of the neck (unirradiated side as control) at least 2 years previously were included. CIMT was measured in 4 arterial segments: proximal, mid, distal common carotid artery (CCA), and bifurcation and were compared to corresponding unirradiated segments. CIMT measurements >75th percentile of a reference population were considered abnormal and at increased cerebrovascular risk., RESULTS: 50 patients (34 males) with a median age of 58 years (interquartile range (IQR) 50-62) were included. The mean maximum dose to the irradiated and unirradiated artery was 53 Gy (standard deviation (SD) 13 Gy) and 1.9 Gy (SD 3.7 Gy), respectively. Mean CIMT was significantly greater in irradiated versus unirradiated arteries: proximal CCA (0.76 mm +/- 0.15 vs 0.68 mm +/- 0.14 (p<0.0001), mid CCA (0.74 mm +/- 0.2 vs 0.68 mm +/- 0.16 (p=0.01), distal CCA (0.77 mm +/- 0.2 vs 0.68 mm +/- 0.15 (p=0.004), and bifurcation (0.85 mm +/- 0.25 vs 0.72 mm +/- 0.17 (p=0.001). For all arterial segments, a significantly greater number of CIMT measurements were abnormal on the irradiated side (proximal: p=0.004, mid: p=0.05, distal: p=0.005, bifurcation: p=0.03). There was no effect of time from RT, age, smoking status, surgery and chemotherapy on CIMT difference (irradiated-unirradiated) in all segments., CONCLUSIONS: CIMT is increased after RT and may be a useful marker of radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis. There appears to be no additional effect of other atherosclerotic risk factors on CIMT following RT. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.9658775
491,"Characterization of biological peculiarities of the radioprotective activity of double-stranded RNA isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae The purpose of the article: Protection from ionizing radiation is the most important component in the curing malignant neoplasms, servicing atomic reactors, and resolving the situations associated with uncontrolled radioactive pollutions. In this regard, discovering new effective radioprotectors as well as novel principles of protecting living organisms from high-dose radiation is the most important factor, determining the new approaches in medical and technical usage of radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Experimental animals were irradiated on the gamma-emitter (Cs137) with a dose of 9.4 Gy. Radioprotective properties of several agents (total RNA, single-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA and B-190) were estimated by the survival/death rates of experimental animals within 30-90 d. Pathomorphological examination of internal organs end electron microscope assay was done on days 9-12 after irradiation. Cloning and other molecular procedures were performed accordingly to commonly accepted protocols. For assessment of the internalization of labeled nucleic acid, bone marrow cells were incubated with double-stranded RNA labeled with 6-FAM fluorescent dye. Cells with internalized double-stranded RNA were assayed using Axio Imager M1 microscope. In the other experiment, bone marrow cells after incubation with double-stranded RNA were stained with Cy5-labeled anti-CD34 antibodies and assayed using Axioskop 2 microscope. Result(s): In this study, several biological features of the radioprotective action of double-stranded RNA are characterized. It was shown that 160 microg of the double-stranded RNA per mouse protect experimental animals from the absolutely lethal dose of gamma-radiation of 9.4 Gy. In different experiments, 80-100% of irradiated animals survive and live until their natural death. Radioprotective properties of double-stranded RNA were found to be independent on its sequence, but strictly dependent on its double-stranded form. Moreover, double-stranded RNA must have 'open' ends of the molecule to exert its radioprotective activity. Conclusion(s): Experiments indicate that radioprotective effect of double-stranded RNA is tightly bound to its internalization into hematopoietic stem cells, which further repopulate the spleen parenchyma of irradiated mice. Actively proliferating progenitors form the splenic colonies, which further serve as the basis for restoration of hematopoiesis and immune function and determine the survival of animals received the lethal dose of radiation.Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded,0.9658711
218,"Impact of gamma irradiation on the development and reproduction of Culex pipiens (Diptera; Culicidae) Purpose: The aim was to evaluate the effects of irradiation of Culex pipiens irradiated as pupae on the larval and pupal mortality percentages, the larval and pupal duration, adult emergence percentages and ovarian development in comparison with the un-irradiated group. Material(s) and Method(s): The mosquito, C. pipiens Linnaeus (L) was irradiated as pupae with three gamma doses 40, 60 and 80 Gy. Different biological aspects include the ovarian development of irradiated females tested. Result(s): Gamma doses used significantly increased the larval and pupal mortality percentages, the larval and pupal duration and significantly decreased the adult emergence percentages. Moreover, fecundity and egg hatchability percentages were severely decreased with increasing gamma doses. While the sterility% was positively correlated with the doses used. Gamma doses caused a dose-dependent decrease in the number of developed eggs, reduction in the number of developed oocytes, signs of degenerative processes in oocytes, yolk mass and egg size decrease. Conclusion(s): Results obtained indicated that gamma radiation of C. pipiens induced remarkable effects on the biological, developmental and reproductive activity.Â© 2018, Copyright Â© 2018 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded,0.9658681

882,"Sweat gland function as a measure of radiation change BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy may result in dryness of the skin even when no other change can be detected. We describe a system for recording the electrical conductance of skin as a measure of sweat gland function., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 22 normal volunteers close agreement was obtained between measurements obtained from comparable sites on both sides of the chest. Measurements were subsequently made in 38 patients treated by radiotherapy to one side of the chest for tumours of the breast or lung using one of five different fractionation schedules. Simultaneous readings were obtained from both sides of the chest with the non irradiated side acting as a control., RESULTS: A dose response relationship was demonstrated: five patients who received the equivalent total dose of 15 Gy in 2-Gy fractions showed no change in conductance. Sixteen out of 23 who received an equivalent total dose of 42-46 Gy in 2-Gy fractions had a greater than 22% reduction in mean skin conductance compared with that of the control areas despite the skin appearing normal in the large majority. Marked changes in skin conductance were seen after higher total doses. In a prospective study 18 women receiving breast irradiation underwent weekly readings during treatment. A mean reduction of 40% in skin conductance was noted by the end of the second week of treatment prior to any clinical evidence of radiation change. Skin conductance returned to normal in 44% of patients by 6 months. In the remainder, those patients who showed the greatest reduction in skin conductance during treatment demonstrated the least recovery., CONCLUSIONS: Changes in sweat gland function can be detected and quantified in skin which may otherwise appear normal. Differences may so be demonstrated between areas treated using different fractionation schedules and the method may be applied to the detection during radiotherapy of unusually sensitive patient.",Excluded,0.9658553
930,"Rapid High-Throughput Diagnostic Triage after a Mass Radiation Exposure Event Using Early Gene Expression Changes Radiological exposure scenarios involving large numbers of people require a rapid and high-throughput method to identify the unexposed, and those exposed to low- and high-dose radiation. Those with high-dose exposure, e.g., >2 Gy and depending on host characteristics, may develop severe hematological acute radiation syndrome (HARS), requiring hospitalization and treatment. Previously, we identified a set of genes that discriminated these clinically relevant groups. In the current work, we examined the utility of gene expression changes to classify 1,000 split blood samples into HARS severity scores of H0, H1 and H2-4, with the latter indicating likely hospitalization. In several previous radiation dose experiments, we determined that these HARS categories corresponded, respectively, to doses of 0 Gy (unexposed), 0.5 Gy and 5 Gy. The main purpose of this work was to assess the rapidity of blood sample processing using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Peripheral blood samples from two healthy donors were X-ray irradiated in vitro and incubated at 37degreeC for 24 h. A total of 1,000 samples were evaluated by laboratory personnel blinded to the radiation dose. Changes in gene expression of FDXR, DDB2, POU2AF1 and WNT3 were examined with qRT-PCR as positive controls. Targeted NGS (TREX) was used on all samples for the same four genes. Agreement using both methods was almost 78%. Using NGS, all 1,000 samples were processed within 30 h. Classification of the HARS severity categories corresponding to radiation dose had an overall agreement ranging between 90-97%. Depending on the end point, either a combination of all genes or FDXR alone (H0 HARS or unexposed) provided the best classification. Using this optimized automated methodology, we assessed 100x more samples approximately three times faster compared to standard cytogenetic studies. We showed that a small set of genes, rather than a complex constellation of genes, provided robust positive (97%) and negative (97%) predictive values for HARS categories and radiation doses of 0, 0.5 and 5 Gy. The findings of this study support the potential utility of early radiation-induced gene expression changes for high-throughput biodosimetry and rapid identification of irradiated persons in need of hospitalization.",Excluded,0.96585435
157,"Cognitive impairment following radiation to hippocampus and other brain structures in adults with primary brain tumours Background: Radiation therapy (RT) to the brain may result in cognitive impairment. The primary objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between RT dose to the hippocampus and learning and memory functions. Secondary objective was to examine relationships between doses to other brain structures and specific cognitive functions. Method(s): A cross-sectional analysis was undertaken in 78 primary brain tumour patients after RT. Cognitive function was assessed by neuropsychological tests. Test scores were standardized using normative data adjusted for age and level of education. Test-specific cognitive impairment was determined as a z-score <=-1.5. Radiation dose to brain structures and test-specific cognitive impairment outcomes were fitted to a logistic regression model. Result(s): High RT dose to the left hippocampus was associated with impaired verbal learning and memory (p = 0.04). RT dose to the left hippocampus, left temporal lobe, left frontal lobe and total frontal lobe were associated with verbal fluency impairment (p < 0.05) and doses to the thalamus and the left frontal lobe with impaired executive functioning (p <= 0.03). Finally, RT dose to the brain and thalamus were associated with impaired processing speed (p <= 0.05). Conclusion(s): The present study indicates that the hippocampus may be vulnerable to radiation and that high radiation doses to the left hippocampus may lead to significant verbal learning and memory impairment. High RT doses to the left hippocampus and other left side structures may result in impairments in verbal fluency, executive function, and processing speed. Validation of these findings are being undertaken in a prospective study.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.9658535
407,"Granulocytopoietic precursor cells and regulatory factors in irradiated human bone marrow The effects of irradiation on committed granulopoietic progenitor cells (CFU-C) and granulopoietic humoral regulators were studied in 17 X-ray treated patients with carcinoma of the breast or of the prostate. After 45 or 70 Gy, the CFU-C decreased to 14 +/- 10% in irradiated areas. This remaining CFU-C population probably reflects a combination of radioresistance and survival in situ, and migration of CFU-C from protected marrow areas. The frequency of peripheral blood CFU-C did not change after irradiation. Endogenous colony stimulating activity (CSA), i.e., release of CSA within the marrow cell population, in post-irradiation bone marrow persisted on roughly the same level, indicating a fairly low radiosensitivity of the CSA-producing cells in the bone marrow. Colony stimulating activity in peripheral blood cells and serum remained unchanged, but there were great interindividual variations, and some of the patients with hypercellularity and CFU-C increase in nonirradiated marrow areas also had increased CSA.

1031,"Evaluating the radioprotective effect of Cimetidine, IMOD, and hybrid radioprotectors agents: An in-vitro study Introduction: There are various radioprotective agents with different mechanisms that help to decrease ionizing radiation side effects. The radioprotective effect of Cimetidine and IMOD was assessed individually and compared with the hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs-IMOD and Cimetidine) on human lymphocyte cells. Method(s): Twenty healthy volunteers (ten men and ten women) participated in the present study. About 75 mL peripheral blood lymphocytes from each individual were collected, and they were divided into 36 groups. Briefly, the blood samples were treated with different concentrations of Cimetidine (12.6 and 25.2 mug/mL) and IMOD (0.04, 0.08, and 0.12 mg/mL), and also a combination of these agents, namely hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs). Besides, the irradiated groups were exposed to 2 and 4 Gy of Co-60 gamma irradiation. The amount of cellular damage was assessed using the micronucleus assay. The repeated measurements and paired T-test statistical analysis were used to compare the micronucleus frequencies in different groups. Result(s): The micronucleus frequencies were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in irradiated groups when the non-toxic concentrations of Cimetidine, IMOD, and HRPAs have been used. The reduction in micronucleus frequency was obtained 5-29% for Cimetidine and 40-51% for IMOD in peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated with 2 Gy. This reduction in 4 Gy irradiation was 8-17% for Cimetidine and 27-37% for IMOD. The HRPAs resulted in a higher radioprotective effect, in a way that they cause up to 58% and 43% micronucleus frequency reduction in 2 and 4 Gy, respectively. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, the HRPAs showed the highest level of radioprotective. In addition, IMOD was remarkably higher radioprotective than Cimetidine, which may be related to its greater non-toxic concentrations.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded,0.9658451
337,"Does tributyl phosphate influence the radiation risk of a highly proliferating system--the early mouse embryo in vitro? Two-cell mouse embryos were exposed in vitro to tributyl phosphate, x rays, or a combination of both. In-vitro development of the embryos was followed microscopically (cleavage to four- and eight-cell embryos, formation of morulae and blastocysts, and hatching of blastocysts). Effects on proliferation were estimated by counting the number of cells per embryo early (48 h p.c. = 48 hours post conceptionem) and late (144 h p.c.) in the preimplantation period. Cytogenetic damage was studied using micronucleus formation as the end point. Tributyl phosphate did not reveal toxic effects up to a concentration of about 5 microM after an exposure time of 18 h. At a concentration of about 15 microM, 50% of late preimplantation embryos showed effects on morphological development and on cell proliferation, and at about 40 microM, 90% of the embryos were affected. Tributyl phosphate did not induce micronuclei. Small effects by x irradiation were observed between 0.25 Gy and 0.5 Gy, depending on the end point measured in the late preimplantation stage. Fifty percent of the embryos were affected by a dose slightly higher than 1 Gy, and 90% after about 4 Gy.

736,"Mitochondrial DNA somatic mutations are frequent in nasopharyngeal carcinoma Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common cancers in southern China, and is highly sensitive to radiotherapy. The control region (D-loop) of mtDNA is a polymorphic region in which point mutations occur frequently. In this study, point mutation and common deletion (CD) mutations were investigated in 23 samples of NPC tumor tissue and in the radiation-treated NPC cell line CNE2. Polymorphisms at 72 (7.28%, 72/988) nucleotide positions in D-loop region and 6 (0.75%, 6/795) nucleotide positions in part of the functional gene encoding regions were detected in all NPC patients. Of the detected polymorphisms, 8 are novel. These variants are nonencoding transitions, including np292T-->C , np517G-del, np16038A-->G, np513G-del, np16242C-->A, np513G-del, np16242C-->A and np15787T-->C transition. A total of 39 point mutations in the D-loop region of mtDNA were detected in 43.5% (10/23) of the NPC patients. Three point mutations in the functional gene encoding regions of mtDNA were detected in only 8.7% (2/23) of NPC patients. The effect of he mutation at np709G-->A in the 12sRNA gene is unclear, and the A-->G substitution at np15769 in the cytochrome B gene is a synonymous mutation. The C-->T substitution at np15970 in the T Psi C loop of the tRNA(pro) gene could alter the position of the proline residue. After irradiation, the survival fraction of CNE2 cells decreased as X-ray dose increased. Moreover, X-ray radiation could induce apoptosis and the CD mutation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but did not induce mtDNA point mutations. A positive correlation between the apoptosis index and the ratio of CD/WT mtDNA was observed in irradiated CNE2 cells. Our results suggest that CD mutation induced by irradiation is one of the late events after apoptosis of the cancer cells, and the mtDNA CD mutation may associated with the susceptibility of NPC cells to IR-induced apoptosis.",Excluded,0.965831
189,"Low-dose radiation exposure and protection against atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice: the influence of P53 heterozygosity We recently described the effects of low-dose gamma-radiation exposures on atherosclerosis in genetically susceptible (ApoE(-/-)) mice with normal p53 function. Doses as low as 25 mGy, given at either early or late stage disease, generally protected against atherosclerosis in a manner distinctly nonlinear with dose. We now report the influence of low doses (25-500 mGy) on atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice with reduced p53 function (Trp53(+/-)). Single exposures were given at either low or high dose rate (1 or 150 mGy/min) to female C57BL/6J ApoE(-/-) Trp53(+/-) mice. Mice were exposed at either early stage disease (2 months of age) and examined 3 or 6 months later, or at late stage disease (7 months of age) and examined 2 or 4 months later. In unirradiated mice, reduced p53 functionality elevated serum cholesterol and accelerated both aortic root lesion growth and severity in young mice. Radiation exposure to doses as low as 25 mGy at early stage disease, at either the high or the low dose rate, inhibited lesion growth, decreased lesion frequency and slowed the progression of lesion severity in the aortic root. In contrast, exposure at late stage disease produced generally detrimental effects. Both low-and high-dose-rate exposures accelerated lesion growth and high dose rate exposures also increased serum cholesterol levels. These results show that at early stage disease, reduced p53 function does not influence the protective effects against atherosclerosis of low doses given at low dose rate. In contrast, when exposed to the same doses at late stage disease, reduced p53 function produced detrimental effects, rather than the protective effects seen in Trp53 normal mice. As in the Trp53 normal mice, all effects were highly nonlinear with dose. These results indicate that variations in p53 functionality can dramatically alter the outcome of a low-dose exposure, and that the assumption of a linear response with dose for human populations is probably unwarranted.",Excluded,0.96580905
735,"Effect of chromosome size on aberration levels caused by gamma radiation as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful technique for detecting genomic alterations at the chromosome level. To study the effect of chromosome size on aberration formation, we used FISH to detect initial damage in individual prematurely condensed chromosomes (PCC) of gamma-irradiated G0 human cells. A linear dose response for breaks and a nonlinear dose response for exchanges was obtained using a chromosome 1-specific probe. FISH detected more chromosome 1 breaks than expected from DNA based extrapolation of Giemsa stained PCC preparations. The discrepancy in the number of breaks detected by the two techniques raised questions as to whether Giemsa staining and FISH differ in their sensitivities for detecting breaks, or is chromosome 1 uniquely sensitive to gamma-radiation. To address the question of technique sensitivity, we determined total chromosome damage by FISH using a total genomic painting probe; the results obtained from Giemsa-staining and FISH were nearly identical. To determine if chromosome 1 was uniquely sensitive, we selected four different sized chromosomes for paint probes and scored them for gamma-ray induced aberrations. In these studies the number of chromosome breaks per unit DNA increased linearly with an increase in the DNA content of the chromosomes. However, the number of exchanges per unit of DNA did not increase with an increase in chromosome size. This suggests that chromosome size may influence the levels of aberrations observed. Extrapolation from measurements of a single chromosome's damage to the whole genome requires that the relative DNA content of the measured chromosome be considered.",Excluded,0.96575725

Radiation risks of CLL significantly increased with increasing bone marrow radiation doses. Current analysis aimed to clarify whether the increased risks were due to radiation or to genetic mutations in the Ukrainian population.

Result(s): Mutations in telomere-maintenance pathway genes POT1 and ATM were more frequent in UR-CLL compared to UN-CLL and W-CLL (both p < 0.05). No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at del13q14, del11q, del17p or trisomy12 was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. Type of work performed in the Chornobyl zone, age at exposure and at diagnosis, calendar time, and Rai stage were significant predictors of total genetic lesions (all p < 0.05). Tumor telomere length was significantly longer in UR-CLL than in UN-CLL (p = 0.009) and was associated with the POT1 mutation and survival. Conclusion(s): No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at CLL-associated genes was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. The novel associations between radiation exposure, telomere maintenance and CLL prognosis identified in this unique case series provide suggestive, though limited data and merit further investigation.Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded,0.9657282
800,"Gene expression signatures of radiation exposure in peripheral white blood cells of smokers and non-smokers Purpose: The issue of potential confounding factors is critical to the development of any approach to radiation biodosimetry, and has not been fully addressed for gene expression-based approaches. Material(s) and Method(s): As a step in this direction, we have investigated the effect of smoking on the global radiation gene expression response in ex vivo-irradiated peripheral blood cells using microarray analysis. We also evaluated the ability of gene expression signatures to predict the radiation exposure level of ex vivo-exposed samples from smokers and non-smokers of both genders. Result(s): We identified eight genes with a radiation response that was significantly affected by smoking status, and confirmed an effect of smoking on the radiation response of the four and a half LIM domains 2 (FHL2) gene using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The performance of our previously defined 74-gene signature in predicting the radiation dose to samples in this study was unaffected by differences in gender or smoking status, however, giving 98% correct prediction of dose category. This is the same accuracy as that found in the original study from which the signature was derived, using different donors. Conclusion(s): The results support the development of peripheral blood gene expression as a viable strategy for radiation biodosimetry. Â© 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded,0.96571255
1140,"Nasal cytological changes as late effects of radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal cancer Background: Radiation therapy is a cornerstone in nasopharyngeal cancer treatment. However, it can induce acute and long-term adverse effects, such as acute mucositis and late submucosal fibrosis. Late toxicities could not only affect submucosa but also mucosal cells, determining long-term cytological changes. Objective(s): Evaluation of delayed nasal cytological alterations in patients who underwent radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): In this case-control study, we analyzed 30 healthy subjects and 30 patients treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy for NPC between 2003 and 2011, with a median follow-up of 59 months. All subjects underwent symptoms anamnestic evaluation (rhinorrea, nasal obstruction), endoscopic fiber optic nasal examination, skin-prick tests, and nasal scraping for cytological exam. Result(s): A higher percentage of rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, mucosal hyperemia, and presence of nasopharyngeal secretions at fiber optic endoscopic exam was found in radiated subjects (p < 0.05). Nasal cytology analysis demonstrated a higher percentage of neutrophilic inflammation and squamous cell metaplasia and mucous cell metaplasia in treated patients (p < 0.05). No cytological atypia was seen. No statistically significant correlation between nasal cytological changes and objective findings, patients' age, tobacco smoking, and gastroesophageal reflux has been found in the radiotherapy group (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Radiation therapy induces late nasal mucosal changes, which may be related to clinical consequences, such as abundant mucus production and its consequent endonasal stagnation. In the future, detailed knowledge of cytological changes in patients' nasal mucosa could represent a key prerequisite for the choice of effective interventions for late radiation-induced rhinitis.Copyright Â© 2015, OceanSide Publications, Inc., U.S.A.",Excluded,0.9656871
744,"53BP1 Repair Kinetics for Prediction of In Vivo Radiation Susceptibility in 15 Mouse Strains We present a novel mathematical formalism to predict the kinetics of DNA damage repair after exposure to both low- and high-LET radiation (X rays; 350 MeV/n 40Ar; 600 MeV/n 56Fe). Our method is based on monitoring DNA damage repair protein 53BP1 that forms radiation-induced foci (RIF) at locations of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in the nucleus and comparing its expression in primary skin fibroblasts isolated from 15 mice strains. We previously reported strong evidence for clustering of nearby DSB into single repair units as opposed to the classic ""contact-first"" model where DSB are considered immobile. Here we apply this clustering model to evaluate the number of remaining RIF over time. We also show that the newly introduced kinetic metrics can be used as surrogate biomarkers for in vivo radiation toxicity, with potential applications in radiotherapy and human space exploration. In particular, we observed an association between the characteristic time constant of RIF repair measured in vitro and survival levels of immune cells collected from irradiated mice. Moreover, the speed of DNA damage repair correlated not only with radiation-induced cellular survival in vivo, but also with spontaneous cancer incidence data collected from the Mouse Tumor Biology database, suggesting a relationship between the efficiency of DSB repair after irradiation and cancer risk.Copyright Â©2020 by Radiation Research Society.

200,"The effect of irradiation on the biodistribution of radiolabeled pegylated liposomes PURPOSE: The effect of total-body irradiation (TBI) on the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of (111)In-DTPA-labeled pegylated liposomes (IDLPL) was evaluated in tumor-bearing nude mice as part of an ongoing effort to develop liposome-targeted radiosensitizers., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Mice received TBI (2 Gy or 5 Gy) according to two protocols: (1) to test the effect of radiation delivered 30 min before liposome injection on the time course of IDLPL biodistribution to tumor and normal tissues over 96 h; (2) to test the effect of radiation at times ranging from 72 h to 1 h before liposome injection on tumor and normal tissue uptake of IDLPL at 24 h. Tumor and tissue/organ levels of liposome uptake were measured by dissection and quantitation in a gamma counter., RESULTS: For most tissues (tumor, liver, kidney, lung, skin, heart, and central nervous system), irradiation did not alter IDLPL biodistribution. Splenic uptake appeared to be increased by TBI, but further analysis revealed that this effect was due to reduced splenic weight in irradiated mice. IDLPL uptake was increased in the small intestine, stomach, musculoskeletal system, female reproductive tract, and adrenal glands in irradiated mice., CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that concomitant administration of liposomal radiosensitizers during radical radiotherapy is likely to be safe. However, caution should be exercised in situations in which significant volumes of small intestine or hemopoietic tissue will be irradiated.",Excluded,0.96565586

The study was performed on 149 people, 84 agricultural workers and 65 healthy men from the same area, who served as the control group. The exposed group was divided into a subgroup with 65 individuals moderately exposed (39 men and 26 women) and a highly exposed subgroup consisted of 19 men. The statistical analysis of the comet assay results showed that there were no significant differences in basal DNA damage between pesticide-exposed workers and the control group nor between moderately and highly exposed ones. In addition, exposure of peripheral blood lymphocytes to hydrogen peroxide or gamma-irradiation led to a similar degree of DNA damage and subsequent repair for all the studied populations.

Late pupae (48 h prior to adult emergence) from a laboratory strain were irradiated with 120 Gy of gamma rays emitted by a 60Co source. Following adult emergence, the mortality of irradiated and non-irradiated cohorts was recorded. Over a period of 50 days after emergence, no significant negative effects of irradiation upon the longevity of male or female laboratory flies were observed. A laboratory competitiveness study (Fried test), using irradiated laboratory and wild males at a ratio of 3:1 was conducted to assess the ability of irradiated males to reduce the egg hatch rates of a wild population.

899,"Impact of various parameters in detecting chromosomal aberrations by FISH to describe radiosensitivity BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Analysis of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations is regarded as the ""gold standard"" for classifying individual radiosensitivity. A variety of different parameters can be used. The crucial question, however, is to explore which parameter is suited best to describe the differences between patients with increased radiosensitivity and healthy individuals., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, five patients with severe radiation-induced late effects of at least grade 3, classified according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), and eleven healthy individuals were examined retrospectively. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were irradiated in vitro with 0.7 Gy and 2.0 Gy prior to cultivation and stained by means of three-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The detailed analysis was focused on the number of breaks per metaphase, on breaks from complex chromosomal rearrangements per metaphase, as well as on the percentage of translocations, dicentric chromosomes, breaks, and excess acentric fragments-each in comparison with the total number of mitoses analyzed., RESULTS: Using the number of breaks from complex chromosomal rearrangements after 2.0 Gy, radiosensitive patients as endpoint were clearly to be distinguished (p = 0.001) from healthy individuals. Translocations (p = 0.001) as well as breaks per metaphase (p = 0.002) were also suitable indicators for detecting differences between patients and healthy individuals. The parameters ""percentage of dicentric chromosomes"", ""breaks"", and ""excess acentric fragments"" in comparison to the total number of mitoses analyzed could neither serve as meaningful nor as significant criteria, since they showed a strong interindividual variability., CONCLUSION: To detect a difference in chromosomal aberrations between healthy and radiosensitive individuals, the parameters ""frequency of breaks per metaphase"", ""complex chromosomal rearrangements"", and ""translocations"" are most suitable.",Excluded,0.96546835
155,"Compartments and cell flows within the mouse haemopoietic system. II. Estimated rates of interchange Part-body irradiated CBA mice were injected with CBA-T6 bone marrow. In this way a predominantly donor population was established in the femora while the marrow of the humeri remained largely (average 94%) of host origin. In animals examined cytologically up to 2 years later, no tendency was observed for the proportion of donor cells in the humeri to increase. Splenectomy had no effect on this. When femoral bone marrow from the experimental mice was injected into lethally (whole-body) irradiated recipients, cells originating from the primary host repopulated the lymph nodes to a disproportionate extent. Equilibration between the cell populations of femora and humeri occurred after re-exposure to 600 rad whole-body irradiation, but not after 100 rad or 350 rad; thus, regeneration of damaged bone marrow involved a significant contribution from extrinsic stem cells only after the highest dose of radiation. The data are compatible with an inflow of at most ten effective stem cells per humerus per day from the blood, and suggest a much lower figure. This means that few if any of the stem cells of peripheral blood enter the bone marrow and found haemopoietic clones. Evidence is adduced for the existence of a proliferating lymphoid sub-population in the bone marrow, contributing some 5-10% of the observed mitoses. The mitotic cells in the lymph nodes are replaced from marrow-derived progenitors at an estimated rate of 4-5%/day. The relevant data for the thymus are more variable, but suggest an average figure of 8-11%/day. Earlier data from mouse parabionts suggest a lower rate of inflow to the thymus.",Excluded,0.96537715
749,"Individual variations in the micronucleus assay for biological dosimetry after high dose exposure The micronucleus assay is widely used as a biological dosimeter. Due to an inhibitory effect of radiation on cell proliferation the assay yields satisfactory results only when the absorbed dose is below about 5Gy. In 2002 Muller and Rode suggested that a modified version of the test, based on the analysis of the ratio of trinucleated to tetranucleated cells and the frequency of micronuclei (Mn) in binucleated cells containing at least one Mn, can be applied to detect a dose reaching 15Gy (Mutat. Res. 502 (2002) 47-51). Their conclusion was based on the results of experiments with lymphocytes from one donor and nothing is known about the possible influence of individual variability on the applicability of the Mn test to detect high doses of radiation. The aim of the present study was to validate the modified micronucleus assay with lymphocytes of 5 donors. Their blood was exposed to 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20Gy of 60Co gamma rays. The levels of Mn and of cell proliferation were assessed using various approaches. A strong inter-individual variability was observed for all endpoints. The results clearly show that the assessment of cell proliferation is essential for the interpretation of results.

770,"Some radiation effects on segregation in Drosophila Translocation induced in the immature oocyte, in meiotic prophase, affects division I orientation and segregation, the usual result being that the two halves of translocations are directed to opposite poles. Since interchange is usually (if not exclusively) between chromatids, this is to be expected from the creation of illegitimate conjunctions. Good agreement is obtained between patterns of segregations deduced from recovered half-translocation bearing exceptions and the kinds of disomic gametes expected as alternative recoveries from the same division I configurations. Inferences drawn from the study of compound-X females have been found to apply as well in the case of females of normal karyotype. Numerical errors occur predominantly, possibly exclusively, in division I. The rate of induced nondisjunction of specific chromosome pairs varies in relation to the structure of the entire complement, as required if radiation-induced nondisjunction is interchange dependent, but which would be unexpected if the mechanism involved effects on individual spindle fibers, chromosomes, or chromosomal bivalents.",Excluded,0.9651793

430,"Transgenerational effects of preconception paternal contamination with (55)Fe The conjecture that germline mutations induced by radiation exposure before conception may predispose subsequent offspring to cancer remains contentious. Previous experimental studies have shown that preconception paternal irradiation with (239)Pu induces perturbations in the hemopoietic systems of offspring and influences sensitivity to a secondary carcinogen. In the present study, male DBA2 mice were injected intravenously with the Auger electron emitter (55)Fe (4 kBq g(-1)) 18 or 84 days before mating with normal females. Comet analysis showed an increased incidence of DNA strand breaks in sperm from contaminated animals after 84 days, but not after 18 days, indicating spermatogonial rather than spermatid damage. Offspring were either assayed for changes in bone marrow stem cells and committed progenitors or challenged with the chemical carcinogen methyl nitrosourea (MNU, 50 mg/kg) at 10 weeks of age and monitored for the onset of malignancy. Offspring from irradiated fathers had normal peripheral blood profiles, although the stem cell population was amplified in offspring arising from those exposed to (55)Fe at 84 days before conception. Exposure to MNU significantly increased the incidence of lympho-hemopoietic malignancies in offspring from the 84-day group, but not in those from the 18-day group. These findings support the hypothesis that aberrations that are potentially leukemogenic may be transmitted to offspring after radiation damage to the paternal germline.",Excluded,0.9648716
704,"The roles of Bcl-xL in modulating apoptosis during development of Xenopus laevis BACKGROUND: Apoptosis is a common and essential aspect of development. It is particularly prevalent in the central nervous system and during remodelling processes such as formation of the digits and in amphibian metamorphosis. Apoptosis, which is dependent upon a balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, also enables the embryo to rid itself of cells damaged by gamma irradiation. In this study, the roles of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-xL in protecting cells from apoptosis were examined in Xenopus laevis embryos using transgenesis to overexpress the XR11 gene, which encodes Bcl-xL. The effects on developmental, thyroid hormone-induced and gamma-radiation-induced apoptosis in embryos were examined in these transgenic animals., RESULTS: Apoptosis was abrogated in XR11 transgenic embryos. However, the transgene did not prevent the apoptotic response of tadpoles to thyroid hormone during metamorphosis. Post-metamorphic XR11 frogs were reared to sexual maturity, thus allowing us to produce second-generation embryos and enabling us to distinguish between the maternal and zygotic contributions of Bcl-xL to the gamma-radiation apoptotic response. Wild-type embryos irradiated before the mid-blastula transition (MBT) underwent normal cell division until reaching the MBT, after which they underwent massive, catastrophic apoptosis. Over-expression of Bcl-xL derived from XR11 females, but not males, provided partial protection from apoptosis. Maternal expression of XR11 was also sufficient to abrogate apoptosis triggered by post-MBT gamma-radiation. Tolerance to post-MBT gamma-radiation from zygotically-derived XR11 was acquired gradually after the MBT in spite of abundant XR11 protein synthesis., CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Bcl-xL is an effective counterbalance to proapoptotic factors during embryonic development but has no apparent effect on the thyroid hormone-induced apoptosis that occurs during metamorphosis. Furthermore, post-MBT apoptosis triggered by irradiation before the MBT could only be restrained by maternal expression of Bcl-xL. Although maternal expression of XR11 was sufficient to abrogate apoptosis triggered by post-MBT gamma-radiation, radiation tolerance from zygotically-derived XR11 was acquired gradually, indicating that synthesis of XR11 protein is not sufficient to prevent apoptosis. Thus, repression of radiation-induced apoptosis by overexpression of Bcl-xL during embryonic development depends upon the timing of its expression and post-translational events that enable the protein to become effective.",Excluded,0.96469116
604,"Effectiveness of gene expression profiling for response prediction of rectal cancer to preoperative radiotherapy Background: Our aim was to determine whether the expression levels of specific genes could predict clinical radiosensitivity in human colorectal cancer. Method(s): Radioresistant colorectal cancer cell lines were established by repeated X-ray exposure (total, 100 Gy), and the gene expressions of the parent and radioresistant cell lines were compared in a microarray analysis. To verify the microarray data, we carried out a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of identified genes in clinical samples from 30 irradiated rectal cancer patients. Result(s): A comparison of the intensity data for the parent and three radioresistant cell lines revealed 17 upregulated and 142 downregulated genes in all radioresistant cell lines. Next, we focused on two upregulated genes, PTMA (prothymosin alpha) and EIF5a2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A), in the radioresistant cell lines. In clinical samples, the expression of PTMA was significantly higher in the minor effect group than in the major effect group (P = 0.004), but there were no significant differences in EIF5a2 expression between the two groups. Conclusion(s): We identified radiation-related genes in colorectal cancer and demonstrated that PTMA may play an important role in radiosensitivity.

Between HNC aetiological groups (HPV positive and HPV negative) clinical evidence demonstrates significantly better treatment response among HPV positive cancers. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are identified in HNC tumour populations as agents of treatment resistance and a target for tumour control. This study examines dynamic responses in populations of a CSC phenotype in HNC cell lines following X-irradiation at therapeutic levels, and comparing between HPV statuses. Variations in CSC density between HPV groups showed no correlation with better clinical outcomes seen in the HPV positive status. CSC populations in HPV positive cell lines ranged from 1.9 to 4.8%, and 2.6 to 9.9% for HPV negative. Following 4Gy X- irradiation however, HPV negative cell lines demonstrated more frequent and significantly greater escalation in CSC proportions, being 3-fold that of the HPV positive group at 72hours post irradiation. CSC proportions of tumour populations are not fixed but subject to change in response to radiation at therapeutic dose levels. These findings imply a potential effect of aetiology on radio-responsiveness in CSCs, illustrating that clonogen treatment response may be more informative of therapy outcomes than inherent population density alone.",Excluded,0.96432567

Method(s): We designed and fabricated an immobilization fixture that incorporates three functions: head stabilizer (through ear bars and tooth bar), gaseous anesthesia delivery and scavenging, and tissue mimic/bolus. Cohorts of five mice were irradiated such that each mouse in the cohort received a unique dose between 1000 and 3000 cGy. DNA damage immunohistochemistry was used to validate an increase in biological effect as a function of radiation dose. Mice were then followed with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Result(s): There was evidence of DNA damage throughout the brain proportional to radiation dose. Radiation-induced damage at the prescribed doses, as depicted by H&E, appeared to be constrained to the white matter consistent with radiological observation in human patients. The severity of the damage correlated with the radiation dose as expected. Conclusion(s): We have designed and manufactured a device that allows us to selectively irradiate the mouse brain with a clinical linear accelerator.

962,"Kruppel-like Factor 5 Regulates Stemness, Lineage Specification, and Regeneration of Intestinal Epithelial Stem Cells Background & Aims: Self-renewal and multipotent differentiation are cardinal properties of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), mediated in part by WNT and NOTCH signaling. Although these pathways are well characterized, the molecular mechanisms that control the 'stemness' of ISCs are still not well defined. Here, we investigated the role of Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) in regulating ISC functions. Method(s): We performed studies in adult Lgr5EGFP-IRES-creERT2;Rosa26LSLtdTomato (Lgr5Ctrl) and Lgr5EGFP-IRES-creERT2;Klf5fl/fl;Rosa26LSLtdTomato (Lgr5DELTAKlf5) mice. Mice were injected with tamoxifen to activate Cre recombinase, which deletes Klf5 from the intestinal epithelium in Lgr5DELTAKlf5 but not Lgr5Crtl mice. In experiments involving irradiation, mice were subjected to 12 Gy total body irradiation (TBI). Tissues were collected for immunofluorescence (IF) analysis and next generation sequencing. Oganoids were derived from fluoresecence activated cell sorted- (FACS-) single cells from tamoxifen-treated Lgr5DELTAKlf5 or Lgr5Crtl mice and examined by immunofluorescence stain. Result(s): Lgr5+ ISCs lacking KLF5 proliferate faster than control ISCs but fail to self-renew, resulting in a depleted ISC compartment. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Klf5-null Lgr5+ cells lose ISC identity and prematurely differentiate. Following irradiation injury, which depletes Lgr5+ ISCs, reserve Klf5-null progenitor cells fail to dedifferentiate and regenerate the epithelium. Absence of KLF5 inactivates numerous selected enhancer elements and direct transcriptional targets including canonical WNT- and NOTCH-responsive genes. Analysis of human intestinal tissues showed increased levels of KLF5 in the regenerating epithelium as compared to those of healthy controls. Conclusion(s): We conclude that ISC self-renewal, lineage specification, and precursor dedifferentiation require KLF5, by its ability to regulate epigenetic and transcriptional activities of ISC-specific gene sets. These findings have the potential for modulating ISC functions by targeting KLF5 in the intestinal epithelium.Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors",Excluded,0.96425605

1027,"Relative dose and vascular response after drug-eluting stent implantation: A dosimetric 3D-intravascular ultrasound study Background In drug-eluting stents (DESs), the theoretical drug dose exposed to the vessel wall per stent surface area may vary due to the fixed loading dose and differences in the stent surface area once expanded in varying vessel sizes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of different dose intensities, as estimated by 3D-IVUS dosimetry, on vascular response after DES implantation. Methods Follow-up (6-9 months) 3D-IVUS was performed in 840 coronary lesions treated with a single DES of the following types: sirolimus (SES, n = 148), paclitaxel (PES, n = 162), Endeavor zotarolimus (E-ZES, n = 233), Resolute zotarolimus (R-ZES, n = 147), and everolimus (EES, n = 150). Volume index (volume/length, mm3/mm) was obtained for vessel, lumen, plaque, stent, and neointima. In each lesion, exposed dose intensity was calculated as known loading dose divided by measured luminal surface area of the stented segment. Lesions were divided into tertiles based on the exposed dose intensity: high, medium, and low dose groups. Results The exposed dose intensity ranged 0.74-1.76 mug/mm2 for SES, 0.41-1.18 mug/mm2 for PES, 0.71-1.57 mug/mm2 for E-ZES, 0.72-1.63 mug/mm2 for R-ZES, and 0.40-0.99 mug/mm2 for EES. All types of DES showed no significant difference in neointimal hyperplasia among the 3 groups, except that E-ZES showed significantly less neointimal hyperplasia in the high dose group. Conclusions Detailed 3D-IVUS revealed significant lesion-to-lesion variability in dose intensity exposed to the vessel wall following DES implantation. However, the major types of DES appear to yield equally effective neointimal suppression, despite the varying dose intensity, except for E-ZES.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

747,"A minimally invasive assay for individual assessment of the ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity Ionizing radiation induces DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) which activate the ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through transcription of genes including CDKN1A (p21) and BBC3 (PUMA). This pathway prevents genomic instability and tumorigenesis as demonstrated in heritable syndromes (e.g., Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT); Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS)). Here, a simple assay based on gene expression in peripheral blood to measure accurately ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity is described. The expression of p21, Puma and Sesn2 was determined in blood from mice with different gene copy numbers of Atm, Trp53 (p53), Chek2 or Arf and in human blood and mitogen stimulated T-lymphocyte (MSTL) cultures from AT, AT carriers, LFS patients and controls, both before and after ex vivo ionizing irradiation. Mouse Atm/Chek2/p53 activity was highly dependent on the copy number of each gene except Arf. In human MSTL, an AT case, AT carriers and LFS patients showed responses distinct from healthy donors. The relationship between gene copy number and transcriptional induction upon radiation was linear for p21 and Puma and correlated well with cancer incidence in p53 variant mice. This reliable blood test provides an assay to determine ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity and demonstrates the feasibility of assessing the activity of this essential cancer protection pathway in simple assays. These findings may have implications for the individualized prediction of cancer susceptibility. Â© 2011 Landes Bioscience.",Excluded,0.964048

Here, we have analysed the mutation frequency at an expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) locus in the germline and bone marrow of the first-generation male offspring of control and irradiated male mice. The frequency of ESTR mutation was studied in the offspring of two reciprocal matings male symbol scid x female symbol BALB/c and male symbol BALB/c x female symbol scid, which were compared with that in BALB/c mice. In the offspring of the BALB/c x BALB/c and male symbol scid x female symbol BALB/c matings, which were conceived after paternal sperm irradiation, the frequency of ESTR mutation was significantly elevated in both tissues. In contrast, ESTR mutation frequency was only slightly elevated in the offspring of male symbol BALB/c x female symbol scid mating conceived after paternal irradiation. The results of this study suggest that the oocytes of scid females are unable to fully support the repair of double-strand breaks induced in paternal sperm which may in turn result in the elimination of cells/embryos containing high levels of DNA damage, thus partially preventing the manifestation of genomic instability.",Excluded,0.9639729
993,"Effects of radiation therapy on the meibomian glands and dry eye in patients with ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy (RT) is the treatment of choice in patients with low-grade ocular adenexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (OAML) and many of them experience post-RT dry eye with varying severity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate ocular effects of RT on meibomian glands and dry eye by directly visualizing structural changes. Secondly, we focused on the comparison of two groups of patients according to tumor location and radiation technique. METHOD(S): Sixty-four eyes with OAML of conjunctiva, orbit, lacrimal gland, or lacrimal sac were grouped into conjunctival lymphoma and ""orbital-type"" lymphoma (i.e., orbit, lacrimal gland, and lacrimal sac). Subjects were investigated for morphological changes in meibomian glands by meiboscore grading system. Radiation technique was examined and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire, Schirmer's test, tear film break-up time (TBUT), slit lamp examination of corneal surface and lid margin abnormality were conducted before and after RT. RESULT(S): The increase in meiboscore was statistically significant over time after RT in both groups (P <0.001). The extent of increase in meiboscore was significantly greater in the ""orbital-type"" lymphoma group than in the conjunctival lymphoma group (P <0.001). The changes in OSDI, TBUT, corneal fluorescein staining score and lid margin abnormality score after RT were significantly different across two groups (P =0.042, 0.001, 0.035 and 0.001, respectively). Schirmer's value decreased after RT in both groups. Dry eye symptoms were most severe right after RT in both groups, but a gradual resolution was noted in most patients with conjunctival lymphoma, whereas symptoms persisted in ""orbital-type"" lymphoma patients. The OSDI score and corneal fluorescein staining score were positively correlated with meiboscore in ""orbital-type"" patients at post-RT 6months (r =0.43, P =0.04; r =0.39, P =0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Patients with OAML had different degrees of morphological changes in meibomian glands according to tumor location and radiation technique. ""Orbital-type"" lymphoma patients are more likely to experience severe injury to meibomian glands, which eventually leads to persistent dry eye. Patients with ""orbital-type"" lymphoma should be well informed of post-RT damage on meibomian glands and persistent dry eye.",Excluded,0.9636066
159,"Modifications of the cutaneous microrelief in the superficial radiation-induced fibrosis: Qualitative study Cutaneous radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) is characterized by a skin retraction or atrophy, toughness to the palpation and often entails functional limitation. Its clinical evaluation remains poorly quantified. The aim of this study was to propose an analytical method to quantify RIF skin surface with the replica technique. In this preliminary study, we report the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the cutaneous microrelief in 44 healthy controls and in four patients presenting a superficial RIF, 3 to 20 years after radiotherapy for cancer. The microrelief of these RIF presented an abnormal anisotropy with a parallel reorganization of cutaneous valleys in three cases out of four, suggesting a premature radiation-induced ageing of the skin. Each subject being his own control, the relative vertical amplitude of the skin microrelief was +/- 15% in control skin. Vertical amplitude was respectively increased by 84% in one inflammatory fibrosis (3 years after RT), decreased by 18% in one evolutive fibrosis (6 years after RT), decreased by 26% in one voluminous stabilized fibrosis (8 years after BT) and decreased by 53% in one atrophic fibrosis (20 years after BT). The present study suggests that the variations of the microrelief parameters could reflect the RIF evolution. This technique requires a validation in a larger series of patients, including patients with telangiectasia.",Excluded,0.9632059
67,"Radiation risks in lung cancer screening programs: a comparison with nuclear industry workers and atomic bomb survivors The National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated that screening with low-dose CT (LDCT) scan reduced lung cancer and overall mortality by 20% and 7%, respectively. The LDCT scanning involves an approximate 2-mSv dose, whereas full-chest CT scanning, the major diagnostic study used to follow up nodules, may involve a dose of 8 mSv. Radiation associated with CT scanning and other diagnostic studies to follow up nodules may present an independent risk of lung cancer. On the basis of the NLST, we estimated the incidence and prevalence of nodules detected in screening programs. We followed the Fleischner guidelines for follow-up of nodules to assess cumulative radiation exposure over 20- and 30-year periods. We then evaluated nuclear worker cohort studies and atomic bomb survivor studies to assess the risk of lung cancer from radiation associated with long-term lung cancer screening programs. The findings indicate that a 55-year-old lung screening participant may experience a cumulative radiation exposure of up to 280 mSv over a 20-year period and 420 mSv over 30 years. These exposures exceed those of nuclear workers and atomic bomb survivors. This assessment suggests that long-term (20-30 years) LDCT screening programs are associated with nontrivial cumulative radiation doses. Current lung cancer screening protocols, if conducted over 20- to 30-year periods, can independently increase the risk of lung cancer beyond cigarette smoking as a result of cumulative radiation exposure. Radiation exposures from LDCT screening and follow-up diagnostic procedures exceed lifetime radiation exposures among nuclear power workers and atomic bomb survivors.",Excluded,0.96318454

1060,"Parasympathetic stimulation improves epithelial organ regeneration Parasympathetic nerves are a vital component of the progenitor cell niche during development, maintaining a pool of progenitors for organogenesis. Injured adult organs do not regenerate after parasympathectomy, and there are few treatments to improve organ regeneration, particularly after damage by therapeutic irradiation. Here we show that restoring parasympathetic function with the neurotrophic factor neurturin increases epithelial organ regeneration after damage. We use mouse salivary gland explant culture containing fluorescently labelled progenitors, and injure the tissue with irradiation. The progenitors survive, parasympathetic function is diminished and epithelial apoptosis reduces the expression of neurturin, which increases neuronal apoptosis. Treatment with neurturin reduces neuronal apoptosis, restores parasympathetic function and increases epithelial regeneration. Furthermore, adult human salivary glands damaged by irradiation also have reduced parasympathetic innervation. We propose that neurturin will protect the parasympathetic nerves from damage and improve organ regeneration. This concept may be applicable for other organs where parasympathetic innervation influences their function.",Excluded,0.9629673

In 10 healthy volunteers, LLLI (0.92 W, 1 : 1 duty cycle, 10 min) to both the SG and CCA significantly increased peak systolic blood velocity in the ophthalmic artery (p<0.001, each) and central retinal artery (p<0.001, each) without changes in vessel resistance. Irradiation to the CCA produced a stronger effect than that to the SG in the ophthalmic artery (p=0.007) and central retinal artery (p=0.031). These data suggest that LLLI to the SG or to the CCA is a useful therapy for increasing the retrobulbar blood flow, with irradiation directed to the CCA being more effective than that directed to the SG in clinical settings.",Excluded,0.962625
43,"Carcinogenic Interactions between a Single Inhalation of 239PuO2 and Chronic Exposure to Cigarette Smoke in Rats Rats were exposed once by inhalation to plutonium-239 dioxide ( 239PuO22), resulting in chronic alpha-particle irradiation of the lung, and exposed chronically to cigarette smoke to examine carcinogenic interactions between the two exposures. F344 rats were exposed to 239PuO22 to achieve an initial lung burden of 0.5 kBq and then exposed 6 h/day, 5 days/week to cigarette smoke at 100 or 250 mg particulate matter/m3 for up to 30 months. Exposure to cigarette smoke increased the cumulative radiation dose to lung by slowing the clearance of 239PuO2. 239PuO2 alone did not affect survival, but the higher cigarette smoke exposure shortened survival in females. Combined exposure to 239PuO2 and cigarette smoke acted synergistically to shorten survival in both genders. The combined effects of cigarette smoke and 239PuO2 were approximately additive for lung hyperplasia and adenomas but were strongly synergistic for carcinomas. Differences between observed incidences and incidences predicted by survival-adjusted models accounting for increased radiation dose revealed a substantial component of synergy for carcinomas above that attributable to the radiation dose effect. The synergy for malignant lung tumors is consistent with findings from uranium miners and nuclear weapons production workers. These results bolster confidence in the epidemiological findings and have implications for risk assessment. Â© 2010 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.9624707
731,"The effect of exposure duration on the biological activity of mobile telephony radiation In the present experiments we studied the effects of different durations of a single (continuous), daily exposure, ranging from 1 min up to 21 min, to the two established systems of digital mobile telephony radiation that are commonly used in Europe, viz. GSM 900 MHz (Global System for Mobile telecommunications) and DCS 1800 MHz (Digital Cellular System-referred to also as GSM 1800 MHz), on a well-tested biological model, the reproductive capacity of the insect Drosophila melanogaster. The insects were exposed to each type of radiation at an intensity of about 10 microW/cm(2), corresponding to a distance of 20 or 30 cm from the antenna of a DCS 1800 or a GSM 900 mobile phone handset, respectively. At these distances the bioactivity of mobile telephony radiation was found to be at a maximum due to the existence of a ""window"" of increased bioactivity around this value, as we have shown recently [1-4]. The results show that the reproductive capacity decreases almost linearly with increasing exposure duration to both GSM 900 and DCS 1800 radiation, suggesting that short-term exposures to these radiations have cumulative effects on living organisms. Additionally, our results show again that GSM 900 MHz radiation is slightly more bioactive than DCS 1800 MHz radiation, at the same exposure durations and under equal radiation intensities, as shown in our previous experiments [5].

821,"Squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma of the skin in relation to radiation therapy and potential modification of risk by sun exposure BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies consistently find enhanced risk of basal cell carcinoma of the skin among individuals exposed to ionizing radiation, but it is unclear whether the radiation effect occurs for squamous cell carcinoma. It is also not known whether subgroups of individuals are at greater risk, eg, those with radiation sensitivity or high ultraviolet radiation exposure., METHODS: We analyzed data from a case-control study of keratinocyte cancers in New Hampshire. Incident cases diagnosed in 1993-1995 and 1997-2000 were identified through a state-wide skin cancer surveillance system, and controls were identified through the Department of Transportation and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service Files (n = 1121 basal cell carcinoma cases, 854 squamous cell carcinoma cases, and 1049 controls)., RESULTS: We found an association between history of radiation treatment and basal cell carcinoma. The association was especially strong for basal cell carcinomas arising within the radiation treatment field (odds ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval = 1.5-4.3), and among those treated with radiation therapy before age 20 (3.4; 1.8-6.4), those whose basal cell carcinomas occurred 40 or more years after radiation treatment (3.2; 1.8-5.8), and those treated with radiation for acne (11; 2.7-49). Similar age and time patterns of risk were observed for squamous cell carcinoma, although generally with smaller odds ratios. For basal cell carcinoma, early exposure to radiation treatment was a risk factor largely among those without a history of severe sunburns, whereas for squamous cell carcinoma, radiation treatment was a risk factor primarily among those with a sun-sensitive skin type (ie, a tendency to sunburn)., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation treatment, particularly if experienced before age 20, seems to increase the long-term risk of both basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. These risks may differ by sun exposure or host response to sunlight exposure.",Excluded,0.96172345
810,"Quantitative changes in respiratory enzyme activity in premalignant lesions and experimentally irradiated skin Chronic exposure of human skin to solar irradiation results in a variety of preneoplastic and frankly neoplastic skin lesions.

Furthermore, there is enhancement of the usual concentration of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity in the granular zone as well as an increase in total G6PDH epidermal activity. In the experimental part of this study, six normal volunteer subjects had areas of normally non exposed skin (buttocks) irradiated with a 2 Mean erythema dose of ultra violet light (290--400 nm) on between 3 and 5 occasions per week for 2--6 week periods.

However, proper therapeutic strategies have not been established yet. The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for MVI of HCC. Method(s): We have analyzed and evaluated 80 consecutive patients with HCC with MVI who underwent EBRT, and factors associated with enhanced survival in EBRT were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): The local response rate of radiotherapy for the irradiated MVI was 66.2%. The time to progression of the irradiated MVI was 5.8 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the higher irradiation dose (over 45 Gy) and the irradiation location (hepatic vein tumor thrombus - HVTT) were significant factors associated with survival benefits of EBRT. The response of EBRT for HVTT was significantly superior to that for portal vein or bile duct tumor thrombus. Conclusion(s): We conclude that a multidisciplinary therapeutic strategy based on EBRT should be proactively selected in the treatment of advanced HCC with MVI.Copyright Â© 2019 S.

The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of actual delivered dose on vascular changes and to test the appropriateness of the current dose prescription., METHODS AND RESULTS: Serial volumetric intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) analysis was performed in 30 in-stent restenosis cases treated with a 40-mm (90)Sr/Y source train. The fixed dose was prescribed at 2 mm from the centerline of the source train (18.4 Gy at 2 mm for reference diameter or =3.36 mm). Only stent segments with full radiation coverage and device injury were enrolled and divided into 2-mm-long subsegments (n=202). D(S90)EEM (the minimum dose absorbed by 90% of the external elastic membrane surface) was calculated as the delivered dose corresponding to each segment, assuming that the radiation catheter occupied the same position in the vessel as the IVUS catheter. Mean D(S90)EEM of 23.5+/-5.82 Gy (range 12.3 to 41.7 Gy) was delivered to these subsegments. Overall, intimal hyperplasia volume remained constant from postintervention to follow-up (2.23+/-1.10 to 2.32+/-1.09 mm3/m; P=NS). Regression analysis revealed there was no correlation between delivered dose intensity and changes in intimal hyperplasia volume. No particular dose-dependent complications were appreciated in this delivered dose range., CONCLUSIONS: The current dose-prescription protocol of (90)Sr/Y radiation to native in-stent restenosis lesions may provide substantial inhibition of neointimal reproliferation regardless of the actual delivered dose intensity.",Excluded,0.9591558

1134,"Radioresistant laryngeal cancers upregulate type 1 IGF receptor and exhibit increased cellular dependence on IGF and EGF signalling Objectives: Patients failing radiotherapy for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) often require salvage total laryngectomy which has major functional consequences, highlighting a need for biomarkers of radiotherapy resistance. In other tumour types, radioresistance has been linked to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R). Here, we evaluated IGF-1R and EGFR as predictors and mediators of LSCC radioresistance. Design(s): We compared IGF-1R and EGFR immunohistochemical scores in patients with LSCC achieving long-term remission post-radiotherapy (n = 23), patients treated with primary laryngectomy (n = 22) or salvage laryngectomy following radiotherapy recurrence (n = 18). To model radioresistance in vitro, two LSCC cell lines underwent clinically relevant irradiation to 55 Gy in 2.75 Gy fractions. Result(s): Type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor expression was higher in pre-treatment biopsies of radiotherapy failures compared with those in long-term remission and was upregulated post-radiotherapy. Patients undergoing primary laryngectomy had more advanced T/N stage and greater tumour IGF-1R content than those achieving long-term remission. Pre-treatment EGFR did not associate with radiotherapy outcomes but showed a trend to upregulation post-irradiation. In vitro, radiosensitivity was enhanced by inhibition of EGFR but not IGF. Repeated irradiation upregulated IGF-1R in BICR18 and SQ20B cells and EGFR in SQ20B, and enhanced SQ20B radioresistance. Repeatedly irradiated SQ20B_55 cells were not radiosensitised by inhibition of IGF and/or EGFR, but IGF-1R:EGFR co-inhibition suppressed baseline cell survival more effectively than blockade of either pathway alone, and more effectively than in parental cells. Conclusion(s): Radiation upregulates IGF-1R and may enhance IGF/EGFR dependence, suggesting that IGF/EGFR blockade may have activity in LSCCs that recur post-radiotherapy.Copyright Â© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Excluded,0.9560512

Material and methods gammaH2AX foci were quantified in tumor specimens of 3 hHNSCC tumor models with known differences in radiosensitivity after reoxygenation in culture medium (10 h, 24 h), single dose exposure (0 Gy, 4 Gy), and fixation 24 h post-irradiation. Multiple, equally treated samples of the same tumor were analyzed for foci, normalized and fitted in a linear mixed-effects model. Results The ex vivo reoxygenation time had no significant effect on gammaH2AX foci counts. A significant intra model heterogeneity could be shown for FaDu (p = 0.033) but not for SKX (p = 0.167) and UT-SCC-5 (p = 0.082) tumors, respectively. All tumor models showed a significant intra-tumoral heterogeneity between specimens of the same tumor (p < 0.01) or among microscopic fields of a particular tumor specimen (p < 0.0001). Conclusion Similar results for ex vivo gammaH2AX foci between 10 h and 24 h reoxygenation time support the applicability of the assay in a clinical setting. The high intra-tumoral heterogeneity underlines the necessity of multiple analyzable samples per patient and therewith the need for an automated foci analysis.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.9553617

Quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect miR-330 expression in serum. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the prognostic value of miR-330 for the radiation sensitivity of brain metastasis from LC. Related clinical factors for radiation sensitivity were assessed by logistic regression analysis, and a survival analysis was conducted using COX regression and the Kaplan-Meier method., RESULTS: MiR-330 exhibited lower expression in the radiation-sensitive group than in the radiation-resistant group. The area under the ROC curve of miR-330 for predicting radiation sensitivity was 0.898 (optimal cut-off value, 0.815), with a sensitivity of 71.7% and a specificity of 90.1%. After radiation therapy, patients with low miR-330 expression, compared to patients with high miR-330 expression, displayed a lower survival rate and a median survival time. MiR-330 expression was correlated with extracranial metastasis, maximum BM diameter, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and node (N) stage. Logistic regression and COX regression analyses revealed that extracranial metastasis, TNM stage, N stage and miR-330 expression were factors that influenced both radiation sensitivity and individual prognostic factors in patients with BM from LC., CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the downregulation of miR-330 correlates with radiation sensitivity and poor prognosis in patients with BM from LC.

I studied the incidence of central nervous system diseases in 30,631 persons employed in Danish utility companies between 1900 and 1993. I linked the cohort to the nationwide, population-based Danish National Register of Patients and compared the numbers of cases of these diseases observed between 1978 and 1993 with the corresponding rates in the general population. In addition I fit to the data on utility workers a multiplicative Poisson regression model in relation to estimated levels of exposure to 50-Hz electromagnetic fields. Overall, there was an increase in risk for senile dementia and motor neuron diseases combined. The incidences of Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and other diseases of the central nervous system were essentially unrelated to exposure to electromagnetic fields. A decreased risk of epilepsy compared with the general population probably reflects a healthy worker effect; I observed an increased risk of epilepsy based on internal comparisons.

978,"A new model of biodosimetry to integrate low and high doses Biological dosimetry, that is the estimation of the dose of an exposure to ionizing radiation by a biological parameter, is a very important tool in cases of radiation accidents. The score of dicentric chromosomes, considered to be the most accurate method for biological dosimetry, for low LET radiation and up to 5 Gy, fits very well to a linear-quadratic model of dose-effect curve assuming the Poisson distribution. The accuracy of this estimation raises difficulties for doses over 5 Gy, the highest dose of the majority of dose-effect curves used in biological dosimetry. At doses over 5 Gy most cells show difficulties in reaching mitosis and cannot be used to score dicentric chromosomes. In the present study with the treatment of lymphocyte cultures with caffeine and the standardization of the culture time, metaphases for doses up to 25 Gy have been analyzed. Here we present a new model for biological dosimetry, which includes a Gompertz-type function as the dose response, and also takes into account the underdispersion of aberration-among-cell distribution. The new model allows the estimation of doses of exposures to ionizing radiation of up to 25 Gy. Moreover, the model is more effective in estimating whole and partial body exposures than the classical method based on linear and linear-quadratic functions, suggesting their effectiveness and great potential to be used after high dose exposures of radiation.",Excluded,0.94646263

150,"Delayed non-myeloablative irradiation after lung transplantation to induce allograft acceptance in a large animal model Purpose: Previously, we induced long term tolerance in animals that underwent perioperative irradiation and a donor-specific alloantigen infusion in our miniature swine lung transplantation model. Here, we delayed induction to improve its clinical applicability. Method(s): Left sided single lung transplantation from MHC mismatched male donors was performed in 11 female outbred minipigs. Group 1 (n= 5) received non-myeloablative irradiation (7 Gy thymus and 1,5 Gy whole body, IRR) 12 hours before transplantation and perioperative donor-specific splenocyte infusion (SpTx). Group 2 (n= 3) also received a perioperative SpTx, but underwent delayed irradiation 3 days after transplantation. Group 3 (n= 3) was also exposed to delayed IRR but did not receive a donor-specific SpTx. Immunosuppression was maintained for 28 days with tacrolimus and methylprednisolone. Peripheral blood chimerism was monitored by flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Result(s): In group 1, three animals never rejected their grafts until elective sacrifice at postoperative days (POD) 800+, the other two showed rejection on POD 239 and 360. In group 2, median allograft survival was 92 days. Out of the third group, one animal showed rejection on POD 226, the other two are currently alive at POD 216 and 393. In all groups, chimerism was detectable 1 hour after reperfusion of the lung, and peaked 1 hour after SpTx in groups 1 and 2. Group 1 showed early leukocyte chimerism levels of up to 30%. Analysis of putative regulatory CD4+CD25 high T cells revealed a rising tendency in group 1, whereas groups 2 and 3 had decreasing levels of this T cell subpopulation after withdrawal of immunosuppression. Conclusion(s): Preoperative irradiation and perioperative SpTx had the potential to upregulate the frequency of putative regulatory CD4+CD25 high T cells. SpTx without preceding IRR seemed to rather upregulate the effector arm, than inducing Treg proliferation. Delayed IRR only may lead to prolonged allograft survival in all three animals.

In exchanges between autosomes, during the S phase, a clear prevalence of asymmetrical rejoining was observed. Later, this prevalence became reduced as the cell approached mitosis. On the other hand, in the exchanges between X-chromosomes in the females there were no significant variations in the type of rejoining through the cell cycle, there being a slight but consistent preference for symmetrical rejoining. These data are discussed in relation to the hypothesis proposed by Olivieri et al. [12] on the organization of the chromosomal sub-units in the interphase nucleus.",Excluded,0.94343245
438,"Histological examination in assessment of ultraviolet-induced suppression of contact hypersensitivity response The evaluation of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) reaction is one of the methods used in the assessment of the immune status of an organism after UV radiation. The aim of the study was to compare usefulness of visual scoring system and histological morphometry in the assessment of CHS response after exposure of humans to solar simulated radiation (SSR). The study included 140 healthy volunteers, 33 people were irradiated for 2 days, 34 - for 10 days and 33 - for 30 days with SSR. Forty non-irradiated individuals served as controls. All the volunteers were sensitized with diphenylocyclopropenone (DPCP) 24 h after final exposure. Statistical analysis comparing intensity of CHS reaction based on visual score between irradiated groups and non-irradiated group revealed no differences (p>0.05). We found a significant difference in epidermal thickness between healthy skin and irradiated groups (p<0.05) and a positive correlation between intensity of spongiosis and clinical score for CHS response at 3.2 DPCP site (p<0.000001). A negative correlation between time of irradiation and spongiosis score was revealed (R=-0.28; p<0.001). We conclude that histological examination of biopsies taken from one of the series of elicitation sites is a reliable and sensitive method in the evaluation of CHS response after UVR.",Excluded,0.9413632
215,"Molecular basis of basal cell carcinogenesis in the atomic-bomb survivor population: p53 and PTCH gene alterations Epidemiological studies suggest that UV exposure from sunlight is the major etiology for skin cancers, both melanocytic and non-melanocytic. However, the radiation-related risk for skin cancer among atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is primarily derived from the excess risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), with no demonstrable excess in squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma. The BCCs in this cohort are therefore unusual in being potentially attributable to two types of radiation - UV and ionizing (IR). BCCs have been associated with PTCH and/or p53 tumor suppressor gene alterations. To investigate the roles of these genes in relation to IR and UV exposures, we analyzed both genes in BCC samples from atomic bomb survivors. We examined 47 tumors, of which 70% had non-silent base-substitution p53 mutations independent of IR or UV exposure. However, the distribution of mutation type depends on UV and/or IR exposure. For example, C-to-T transitions at CpG sites adjacent to pyrimidine-pyrimidine (PyPy) sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-exposed than UV-shielded body areas and CpG-mutations at non-PyPy sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-shielded body areas with high-IR (>=1 Gy) than low-IR (<0.2 Gy) exposure. And notably, although p53 deletion-frequencies demonstrated no IR-dose associations, deletions at the PTCH locus were more frequent (79% versus 44%) in tumors with high-IR than low-IR exposure. Moreover, 60% of high-IR tumors harbored both p53 and PTCH abnormalities compared with 23% of low-IR tumors. Therefore, alteration of both genes is likely to play a role in radiation-induced basal cell carcinogenesis. Â© 2006 Oxford University Press.",Excluded,0.93918574
761,"Improvement and induction property of radiation-responsive promoter through DNA shuffling of 5'-flanking regions of the human p21 gene A promoter that augments gene expression in response to stimulation of ionizing radiation would be a desired tool for radiogenetic therapy, a combination of radiotherapy and gene therapy. Although various promoters occurring naturally or artificially have been used for researches, one showing higher reactivity to ionizing radiation is desirable. In the present study, we attempted to improve a radiation-responsive promoter of the p21 through a technique called DNA shuffling. A library of DNA fragments was constructed by re-ligation of randomly digested promoter fragments and improved promoters were chosen out of the library. We repeated this process twice to obtain a promoter showing 2.6-fold better reactivity to ionizing radiation compared with its parent, p21 promoter after 10 Gy gamma-ray irradiation. Nucleotide sequence analyses revealed that the obtained promoter was densely packed with some of the cis-acting elements including binding sites for p53, NF-kappaB, NRF-2, AP-1 and NF-Y more than p21 promoter. In addition, it was shown that its induction by ionizing radiation was dependent upon p53 status of a cell line, suggesting that the promoter retained properties of the p21 promoter. This technique is simple and efficient to improve a promoter responsive to other stimulus of interest besides IR. Â© 2009 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.",Excluded,0.93886703
549,"The human leulocyte test system. VII. Further investigations concerning micronucleus-derived premature chromosome condensation Premature chromosome condensation (PCC) from X-ray induced micronuclei shows a dose-effect relationship in human leukocytes in vitro. Preparations at different culture times without colcemide treatment reveal complex variations of the frequencies of micronuclei and PCC correlated with the fixation time. The positions of PCC patches in the metaphase plate and the frequencies of different PCC types (S and G2) ar independent on the X-ray dose. The latter indicates that the slowing down of the micronuclei in the cell cycle, which is the reason for the formation of PCC, may be an outcome rather of a regulatory phenomenon than of an unspecific physiological damage of the chromatin included in the micronuclei. This is especially evident from labeling experiments with tritiated thymidine, showing that the extent of asynchrony between main nuclei and micronuclei is independent on the X-ray dose. Labeling experiments with tritiated uridine reveal a X-ray dose dependent suppression of RNA synthesis in cells with main nuclei and micronuclei. THE S-phase nature of ""pulverized"" PCC patches could be verified by incorporation of tritiated thymidine in aound 50%. Staining of centromeric heterochromatin in micronuclei reveal a frequency of micronuclei with centromeric heterochromatin resembling the frequency of G2-phase PCC found in mitoses.",Excluded,0.9359393

METHOD(S): Women diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 6213) and randomly selected age-matched control subjects (n = 7390) provided breast cancer risk factor information and occupational history. A qualified industrial hygienist classified each job for EMF exposure as background, low, medium, or high. RESULT(S): When compared with the referent of background exposure, the odds ratio adjusted for age and state of residence was 1.06 (95% CI = 0.99-1.14) for low exposure, 1.09 (95% CI = 0.96-1.23) for medium exposure, and 1.16 (95% CI = 0.90-1.50) for high exposure.

289,"Hypoxia-inducible factor pathway inhibition resolves tumor hypoxia and improves local tumor control after single-dose irradiation Purpose To study the effects of BAY-84-7296, a novel orally bioavailable inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activity, on hypoxia, microenvironment, and radiation response of tumors. Methods and Materials UT-SCC-5 and UT-SCC-14 human squamous cell carcinomas were transplanted subcutaneously in nude mice. When tumors reached 4 mm in diameter BAY-84-7296 (Bayer Pharma AG) or carrier was daily administered to the animals. At 7 mm tumors were either excised for Western blot and immunohistologic investigations or were irradiated with single doses. After irradiation animals were randomized to receive BAY-84-7296 maintenance or carrier. Local tumor control was evaluated 150 days after irradiation, and the dose to control 50% of tumors (TCD50) was calculated. Results BAY-84-7296 decreased nuclear HIF-1alpha expression. Daily administration of inhibitor for approximately 2 weeks resulted in a marked decrease of pimonidazole hypoxic fraction in UT-SCC-5 (0.5% vs 21%, P<.0001) and in UT-SCC-14 (0.3% vs 19%, P<.0001). This decrease was accompanied by a significant increase in fraction of perfused vessels in UT-SCC-14 but not in UT-SCC-5. Bromodeoxyuridine and Ki67 labeling indices were significantly reduced only in UT-SCC-5. No significant changes were observed in vascular area or necrosis. BAY-84-7296 before single-dose irradiation significantly decreased TCD50, with an enhancement ratio of 1.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.72) in UT-SCC-5 and of 1.55 (95% CI 1.26-1.94) in UT-SCC-14. BAY-84-7296 maintenance after irradiation did not further decrease TCD50. Conclusions BAY-84-7296 resulted in a marked decrease in tumor hypoxia and substantially reduced radioresistance of tumor cells with the capacity to cause a local recurrence after irradiation. The data suggest that reduction of cellular hypoxia tolerance by BAY-84-7296 may represent the primary biological mechanism underlying the observed enhancement of radiation response. Whether this mechanism contributes to the improved outcome of fractionated chemoradiation therapy warrants further investigation. Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.9296137
521,"Investigations on radiosensitive and radioresistant populations of Drosophila melanogaster. XVI. Adaptation to the mutagenic effects of X-rays in several experimental populations with irradiation histories Selection responses of the laboratory stock Berlin wild (+60, +K) of Drosophila melanogaster to the mutagenic effects of high, accumulated exposures of X-rays were studied in several sub-populations with long irradiation histories. Interest was focussed on adaptive adjustments of mutation rates. In samples from the populations, radiosensitivities of immature oocytes were tested, by using dominant lethals (A), X-chromosome losses (B) and sex-linked recessive lethals (C) as end-points of genetic radiation damage. Populations RO II and RO V are similar to the previously studied population RO I and were exposed to 2100 R/generation, delivered to oocyte stages 6-14, mature sperm, and spermatids. RO II (first tests after 160 generations) is radioresistant relative to +60 (control). The resistance was characterized by dose-reduction factors (DRFs) of 1.72 (with respect to end-points A, B) and 1.53 (C), and these were similar to those previously obtained for RO I. The resistance of RO II was inherited semidominantly as was that of RO I, and the radiosensitivity of the hybrids RO I/RO II was similar to that of RO I and RO II with respect to end-points A and B. RO V did not become resistant within 25 generations of irradiation history (A). Populations RO III (6000 R/generation) and RO IV (7000 R/generation) have histories of irradiations given to oogonia and spermatogonia. Radiosensitivities of immature oocytes of RO III did not differ from those of +K after 55 generations, but after 105 and 135 generations of irradiation history, DRFs of 1.2 (A) and 1.44 (B) were observed. RO IV was characterized in generations 55-135 by DRFs of 1.31 (A) and 1.72 (B). Selection for relative radioresistance of immature oocytes was found (1) to be reproducible (RO II-RO IV), (2) not to require genetic pre-adaptation (RO V), and (3) to be, in part, also achieved by 'indirect' selection (RO III, RO IV). It is concluded that mutation rates in populations are selectively adjusted to evolutionary requirements.",Excluded,0.9289306
1015,"Ocular arterial blood flow of choroidal melanoma eyes before and after stereotactic radiotherapy using Leksell gamma knife: 2 year follow up Aims - To evaluate the effect of high dose stereotactic radiotherapy on the ocular blood flow of patients with uveal melanoma. Methods - Colour Doppler imaging (CDI) was used to measure blood flow velocity and vascular resistance in the ophthalmic, short posterior, and central retinal arteries of nine patients suffering from uveal melanoma. The measurements were taken before, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after stereotactic radiotherapy. Irradiation was performed with the Leksell gamma knife with the 59 (41-66.5) Gy total marginal dose divided in two equal fractions. CDI results were compared with age and sex matched healthy control eyes. Results - At each time of measurement, blood flow velocity in the central retinal artery of the affected eyes was significantly reduced whereas vascular resistance was only increased at the 2 year follow up. Blood flow velocity and vascular resistance in the short posterior arteries of melanoma eyes were also only significantly altered at the 2 year follow up. Blood flow velocity and vascular resistance in the ophthalmic artery of melanoma eyes were not changed at all follow ups. Conclusions - In the melanoma eyes, blood flow velocity in the central retinal artery is reduced. High dose stereotactic radiotherapy with the Leksell gamma knife and a 59 (41-66.5) Gy total marginal dose in two fractions leads to a significant reduction of blood flow and a significant increase in resistance variables in the small ocular arteries within 2 years.",Excluded,0.92811626
97,"Low sensitivity of the sister chromatid exchange assay to detect the genotoxic effects of radioiodine therapy To assess the genotoxic risk associated with 131I therapy, sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and cells with unusually high SCE counts (HFC) were determined in a follow-up study performed with 46 hyperthyroidism and 39 thyroid cancer patients treated with 131I. In addition, a crosssectional study was also carried out with 78 control persons and 51 thyroid cancer patients that had completed radioiodine therapy from 1 to 6 years prior to the current investigation. In the follow-up analysis, the study was conducted over time and four blood samples were drawn from each patient: the first one prior to the radioiodine treatment, with the remaining three taken sequentially over the year after therapy. Concerning the results obtained for the whole population in the follow-up study, the SCE and HFC values found after radioiodine therapy did not show any significant increase, neither in the hyperthyroidism nor thyroid cancer groups. Unlike the results mentioned above, when the effect of smoking habit was considered, there was a slight but significant increase in SCE in the samples taken 3 months and 1 week after 131I therapy in the hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer non-smokers, respectively. The data obtained in the cross-sectional study did not show differences in SCE and HFC between the control group and the cancer group treated with 131I. It is noteworthy that among the different parameters analysed, smoking habit is the only factor that showed a direct relationship with SCE and HFC and, as a consequence, smokers had significantly more SCE and HFC than nonsmokers. Taking into account our previous investigations showing a highly significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei for the same patients and sampling times, the outcomes obtained would suggest that the eventual genotoxic effect of 131I therapy could not be dearly detected by the SCE assay. This would reinforce the view that ionizing radiation appears to be a poor inducer of SCEs.",Excluded,0.9257191

319,"Parotid gland-recovery after radiotherapy in the head and neck region - 36 months follow-up of a prospective clinical study Background: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the recovery potential of the parotid glands after using either 3D-conformal-radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) by sparing one single parotid gland. Method(s): Between 06/2002 and 10/2008, 117 patients with head and neck cancer were included in this prospective, non-randomised clinical study. All patients were treated with curative intent. Salivary gland function was assessed by measuring stimulated salivary flow at the beginning, during and at the end of radiotherapy as well as 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after treatment. Measurements were converted to flow rates and normalized relative to rates before treatment. Mean doses (Dmean) were calculated from dose-volume histograms based on computed tomographies of the parotid glands. Result(s): Patients were grouped according to the Dmean of the spared parotid gland having the lowest radiation exposure: Group I - Dmean < 26 Gy (n = 36), group II - Dmean 26-40 Gy (n = 45), and group III - Dmean > 40 Gy (n = 36). 15/117 (13%) patients received IMRT. By using IMRT as compared to 3D-CRT the Dmean of the spared parotid gland could be significantly reduced (Dmean IMRT vs. 3D-CRT: 21.7 vs. 34.4 Gy, p < 0.001). The relative salivary flow rates (RFSR) as a function of the mean parotid dose after 24 and 36 months was in group I 66% and 74%, in group II 56% and 49%, and in group III 31% and 24%, respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that the parotid gland dose and the tumor site were the independent determinants 12 and 36 months after the end of RT. Patients of group I and II parotid gland function did recover at 12, 24, and 36 months after the end of RT. Conclusion(s): If a Dmean < 26 Gy for at least one parotid gland can be achieved then this is sufficient to reach complete recovery of pre-RT salivary flow rates. The radiation volume which depends on tumor site did significantly impact on the Dmean of the parotids, and thus on the saliva flow and recovery of parotid gland.Copyright Â© 2011 Hey et al.",Excluded,0.9214421

This prolonged survival was observed for each of several minor histocompatibility (H) antigens and is antigen-specific. Gamma radiation (3300 rads) abolished the ability of male spleen cells infused i.v. to delay the rejection of male skin grafts (H-Y antigen) on female recipients. However, depletion of Thy-1+ cells from the i.v. infusion failed to abolish the ability to prolong male skin graft survival. Furthermore, the prolonged survival accorded to B6 (H-2b) male skin grafts on CB6F1 (H-2b/H-2d) female recipients given i.v. infusions of B6 male spleen cells extended to BALB/c (H-2d) male skin grafts as well, indicating a lack of MHC restriction. Thus, prolongation of minor allograft survival by i.v. infusion of minor H antigen-bearing spleen cells appears not to depend on veto T cells that others have found to be responsible for the suppression of CTL generation (2, 3, 5).",Excluded,0.91866887

1074,"Impact of radiation dose to neural stem cell niche on outcomes in malignant gliomas 4 Background: Malignant gliomas represent most aggressive form of brain tumours. They are characterised by poor prognosis and universal recurrences. Recent studies indicate that malignant gliomas contain cancer stem cells which are capable of self-renewal and tumour propagation. The origin Gliomas Cancer stem cells is believed to be from normal neuronal stem cells (NSC) located in subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult human brain. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between radiation dose to the subventricular zone and survival in malignant glioma patients. Method(s): 40 adult patients diagnosed as Grade III or Grade IV Glioma at Yashoda Hospitals between January of 2014 and July of 2014 were included in this study. Using radiation planning software and patient radiological records, the subventricular zone was reconstructed for each of these patients and dosimetry data for these structures was calculated. Log Rank Test and Multivariate analysis were used to find the impact of High Subventricular Zone dose on survival. Result(s): The mean of age of the sample population is 49.68 years (range, 20-78 years). ECOG Status for the all the patients enrolled in the study is 1. Out of 40 patients enrolled into the trial 31 are of Grade 4 Tumors (Glioblastoma) and 9 were Grade 3 tumours. Median doses of the means of Ipsilateral subventricular zone, Contralateral subventricular zone and Total subventricular zone are 50.89, 34.66 and 41.04 respectively. Median overall survival of the sample population is 21 months. One year survival of the sample population is 85%; 2 year survival is 35%. Univariate analysis has not shown any significant impact higher median dose in malignant gliomas. However when Univariate analysis was done in Grade IV gliomas there is significant impact of higher median dose to Ipsilateral Subventricular zone (P value 0.01) and Total Subventricular zone on Overall survival (P value 0.04).

334,"Altered senescence, apoptosis, and DNA damage response in a mutant p53 model of accelerated aging The tumor suppressors p16(INK4a) and p53 have been implicated as contributors to age-associated stem cell decline. Key functions of p53 are the induction of cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Here, we examine senescence, apoptosis, and DNA damage responses in a mouse accelerated aging model that exhibits increased p53 activity, the p53(+/m) mouse. Aged tissues of p53(+/m) mice display higher percentages of senescent cells (as determined by senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining and p16(INK4a) and p21 accumulation) compared to aged tissues from p53(+/+) mice. Surprisingly, despite having enhanced p53 activity, p53(+/m) lymphoid tissues exhibit reduced apoptotic activity in response to ionizing radiation compared to p53(+/+) tissues. Ionizing radiation treatment of p53(+/m) tissues also induces higher and prolonged levels of senescence markers p16(INK4a) and p21, suggesting that in p53(+/m) tissues the p53 stress response is enhanced and is shifted away from apoptosis toward senescence. One potential mechanism for accelerated aging in the p53(+/m) mouse is a failure to remove damaged or dysfunctional cells (including stem and progenitor cells) through apoptosis. The increased accumulation of dysfunctional and senescent cells may contribute to reduced tissue regeneration, tissue atrophy, and some of the accelerated aging phenotypes in p53(+/m) mice.",Excluded,0.90311724

Recent studies have suggested that this is hypothalamic in origin. Hypothalamic and pituitary functions were studied in 11 patients, 4 men and 7 women, 4.5 years or more after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinomas. The estimated average total dose was 5000 cGys for the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Except for 2 women with amenorrhea and 4 men with impotency, the patients did not have evident endocrine deficiency. Baseline hormone profiles revealed normal T4, T3 and cortisol levels, 6 with elevated prolactin, 3 with reduced testosterone and 3 with slightly elevated basal TSH.

Four (1 menstruating, 1 amenorrheic, 2 menopausal) women did not reach peak FSH response 4 hours after LHRH injection. The other amenorrheic woman had minimal FSH and LH response to LHRH which persisted even after 8 days of pulsatile infusion of LHRH (1 microgram/90min). TSH response to TRH (400 micrograms, i.v.) was delayed in 7 patients. GH response to human GRH (1 microgram/kg, i.v.) was impaired in 6 patients (maximal GH less than 5 mU/l).

Three patients who had normal GRH tests had impaired GH response to insulin hypoglycemia. Six patients had an empty sella on CT scan. From this study the following conclusions are drawn: (1) Among the four axes, GH is the most vulnerable. (2) The insulin tolerance test is still the best single test for evaluation of hypothalamic function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded,0.87761563
574,"Analysis of causal models of diet for patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiation therapy Purpose: This study seeks to establish causal models of diet which maintain the appetite of head and neck cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. Sample and methods: We collected data from 208 patients at two radiation doses, 30/50 Gy, using a questionnaire on appetite and analyzed the items using structural equation modeling. Result(s): In the causal model for 30 Gy, we established a path using the four intervening variables "" ease of consuming foods in smooth forms,"" "" ease of consuming foods with a chewable texture and suitable temperature,"" "" ease of consuming lightly seasoned foods with a flavorful smell,"" and "" overall ease of consuming a given meal"" from the temporal relationship between "" dietary preferences"" and "" maintaining appetite while caring for the oral cavity."" In the causal model for 50 Gy, we established a path between "" ease of consuming foods with a mild temperature and smell,"" and "" maintaining appetite while caring for the oral cavity"" using the four intervening variables "" ease of consuming foods that are easy to swallow,"" "" ease of consuming foods that dissolve well in the mouth,"" "" ease of consuming foods with a mild taste,"" and "" overall ease of consuming a given meal."" The goodness of fit indices for both models were above 0.85 for both the goodness of fit index (GFI) and adjusted GFI (AGFI), and less than 0.08 for root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), indicating a satisfactory goodness of fit. Conclusion(s): Food characteristics help to maintain patient appetite at cumulative radiation doses of 30/50 Gy. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded,0.87364936
1068,"IL-10 IS DOWN-REGULATED IN THE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES SUSPECTED PATIENTS, INDEPENDENT OF ANGIOGRAPHY IL-10 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) are the important anti and pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively, which may participate in the cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. Additionally, environmental factors, such as the X-ray, can modulate cytokine expression. Due to the fact that X-ray is used during angiography, hence, angiography may alter expression of the cytokines., OBJECTIVE: Accordingly, this project was aimed to assess IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels within cardiovascular patients (with and without vessel stenosis) versus healthy controls and also the effects of angiography on the serum levels of the cytokines., MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was performed on the 80 participants, including twenty cases in each group (healthy controls and cardiovascular patients without vessel stenosis, stenosis of 1 vessel and stenosis of more than 1 vessel) to evaluate IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels using ELISA technique. The IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels also compared within group 2, 3 and 4 before and after angiography to explore the effects of the technique on the IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels., RESULTS: IL-10, but not IFN-gamma, serum levels were higher in the healthy controls than all cardiovascular patients. IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels were not altered after angiography and also were not differ in the smoker versus non- smoker and opium consuming versus non-opium consuming participants., CONCLUSION: Due to the results it may be concluded that IL-10 can be considered as a plausible inhibitor of cardio- vascular diseases independent of angiography duration and X-ray, however, IFN-gamma has no effects in the Iranian patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases.

422,"Change in fibroblast growth factor 2 expression as an early phase radiotherapy-responsive marker in sequential biopsy samples from patients with cervical cancer during fractionated radiotherapy Background: The authors previously demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression levels in tumor cells (FGF2-T) may be an indicator of the efficacy of radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer (CC). In the current study, this finding was extended in newly enrolled patients and was investigated further in stromal FGF2 (FGF2-S) expression. Method(s): Sixty-nine patients with CC were recruited as a validation set for the immunohistochemical detection of FGF2-T from biopsy samples that were taken before (pretreatment) or 1 week after the initiation of radiotherapy (midtreatment). The authors also investigated the expression of FGF2 in tumor FGF2-S and investigated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) (also called platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule) in these patients and in an additional 35 patients from a previous study. Result(s): FGF2 expression was detected in tumor cells from all patients and in stromal cells from 87% of patients. FGF2-T was significantly higher in midtreatment samples (P =.0002), and a high ratio of midtreatment/pretreatment FGF2-T was related significantly to a better prognosis (P =.025). Increased VEGF expression after the initiation of radiotherapy was related significantly to positive FGF2-S in pretreatment samples (P =.035); however, it was not related to prognosis or microvessel density detected by CD31 expression. Conclusion(s): Radiation causes a response in tumor cells and adjacent normal cells and changes the extracellular matrix environment. In this study, the authors confirmed their previous findings and demonstrated that changes in FGF2-T expression may be used as a marker to monitor the effectiveness of radiotherapy in patients with CC. These findings should improve patient selection for molecular targeted therapies, such as cytokine inhibitors, after standard-of-care treatment. Â© 2010 American Cancer Society.",Excluded,0.8679232
274,"Effects of psychotherapy on DNA strand break accumulation originating from traumatic stress Background: Previous research reveals an association between traumatic stress and an increased risk for numerous diseases, including cancer. At the molecular level, stress may increase carcinogenesis via increased DNA damage and impaired DNA repair mechanisms. We assessed DNA breakage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and measured the cellular capacity to repair single-strand breaks after exposure to ionizing X-radiation. We also investigated the effect of psychotherapy on both DNA breakage and DNA repair. Method(s): In a first study we investigated DNA breakage and repair in 34 individuals with PTSD and 31 controls. Controls were subdivided into 11 trauma-exposed subjects and 20 individuals without trauma exposure. In a second study, we analysed the effect of psychotherapy (Narrative Exposure Therapy) on DNA breakage and repair. Thirty-eight individuals with PTSD were randomly assigned to either a treatment or a waitlist control condition. Follow-up was performed 4 months and 1 year after therapy. Result(s): In study 1 we found higher levels of basal DNA breakage in individuals with PTSD and trauma-exposed subjects than in controls, indicating that traumatic stress is associated with DNA breakage. However, single-strand break repair was unimpaired in individuals with PTSD. In study 2, we found that psychotherapy reversed not only PTSD symptoms, but also DNA strand break accumulation. Conclusion(s): Our results show-for the first time in vivo-an association between traumatic stress and DNA breakage; they also demonstrate changes at the molecular level, i.e., the integrity of DNA, after psychotherapeutic interventions.

71,"Mortality and cancer registration experience of the Sellafield employees known to have been involved in the 1957 Windscale accident The mortality and cancer morbidity experience of the 470 male Sellafield employees known to be involved in the 1957 Windscale accident is reported. All these employees are known to have been involved in dealing with the fire itself, or in the clean-up operation afterwards. The size of the study population is small, leading to predicted low power to reveal any effects, but the cohort is of interest because of the involvement of the workers in the accident. For 1957-97, using rates for England and Wales to calculate the expected numbers, the all causes standardised mortality ratio (SMR) is 100 (observed = 258, expected = 258.80), and the all malignant neoplasms SMR is 79 (observed = 58, expected = 73.12) which is not significantly different from 100. For 1971-91, the all malignant neoplasms standardised registration ratio (SRR) of 85 (observed = 59, expected = 69.23) is not significantly different from 100. Significant excesses of deaths from diseases of the circulatory system (SMR = 121) and from ischaemic heart disease (SMR = 128), and a significant deficit of deaths from cancer of the genito-urinary organs (SMR = 31), were found. There were no significant differences in mortality rates between workers who had received high recorded external doses during the fire and those who had received low doses, though the power of this comparison was low. Comparison of the mortality rates of workers directly involved in the accident with workers in post, but not so involved, showed no significant differences.

520,"Hearing Assessment after Treatment of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma with CRT and IMRT Techniques OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the long-term hearing loss after treatment of primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma to elucidate its causal factors., METHODS: Ninety-two nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients were treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Pure tone audiometry was performed before the therapy and annually up to 9 years after completing treatment. The hearing thresholds were corrected for age-related deterioration and compared to the results without adjusting for age., RESULTS: The mean air and bone conduction threshold with and without correction for age-related deterioration differed significantly 2-9 years after completing radiotherapy (p < 0.05). The audiometry results with age correction showed a flattened configuration compared to the results without age correction. The total radiation dose and radiation modality showed a causal relationship with a greater incidence of hearing loss after therapy (p < 0.05). There was more deterioration in the air and bone hearing thresholds with conformal radiotherapy than intensity-modulated radiotherapy (p < 0.001). A radiation dose >72 cGy resulted in more severe hearing loss than <72 cGy (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Hearing loss after completing therapy should be corrected for age-related hearing deterioration to reveal the true extent to which the loss is a therapeutic complication. Both the radiation modality used and the dose were significantly associated with hearing loss.",Excluded,0.8508715

721,"Temporal evolution of parotid volume and parotid apparent diffusion coefficient in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy investigated by magnetic resonance imaging: A pilot study Purpose: To concurrently quantify the radiation-induced changes and temporal evolutions of parotid volume and parotid apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 11 NPC patients (9 men and 2 women; 48.7 +/- 11.7 years, 22 parotid glands) were enrolled. Radiation dose, parotid sparing volume, severity of xerostomia, and radiation-to-MR interval (RMI) was recorded. MRI studies were acquired four times, including one before and three after radiotherapy. The parotid volume and the parotid ADC were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and MedCalc. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. A P value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Result(s): The parotid volume was 26.2 +/- 8.0 cm3before radiotherapy. The parotid ADC was 0.8 +/- 0.15 x 10-3mm2/sec before radiotherapy. The parotid glands received a radiation dose of 28.7 +/- 4.1 Gy and a PSV of 44.1 +/- 12.6%. The parotid volume was significantly smaller at MR stage 1 and stage 2 as compared to pre-RT stage (P <.005). The volume reduction ratio was 31.2 +/- 13.0%, 26.1 +/- 13.5%, and 17.1 +/- 16.6% at stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The parotid ADC was significantly higher at all post-RT stages as compared to pre-RT stage reciprocally (P <.005 at stage 1 and 2, P <.05 at stage 3). The ADC increase ratio was 35.7 +/- 17.4%, 27.0 +/- 12.8%, and 20.2 +/- 16.6% at stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The parotid ADC was negatively correlated to the parotid volume (R = -0.509; P <.001). The parotid ADC was positively associated with the radiation dose significantly (R2 = 0.212; P =.0001) and was negatively associated with RMI significantly (R2 = 0.203; P =.00096) significantly. Multiple regression analysis further showed that the post-RT parotid ADC was related to the radiation dose and RMI significantly (R2 = 0.3580; P <.0001). At MR stage 3, the parotid volume was negatively associated with the dry mouth grade significantly (R2 = 0.473; P <.0001), while the parotid ADC was positively associated with the dry mouth grade significantly (R2 = 0.288; P =.015). Conclusion(s): Our pilot study successfully demonstrates the concurrent changes and temporal evolution of parotid volume and parotid ADC quantitatively in NPC patients treated by IMRT. Our results suggest that the reduction of parotid volume and increase of parotid ADC are dominated by the effect of acinar loss rather than edema at early to intermediate phases and the following recovery of parotid volume and ADC toward the baseline values might reflect the acinar regeneration of parotid glands.

605,"Eye lens radiation exposure to interventional cardiologists: A retrospective assessment of cumulative doses Radiation dose to the eye lens is a crucial issue for interventional cardiologists (ICs) who are exposed during the procedures they perform. This paper presents a retrospective assessment of the cumulative eye lens doses of ICs enrolled in the O'CLOC study for Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology. Information on the workload in the catheterisation laboratory, radiation protection equipment, eye lens dose per procedure and dose reduction factors associated with eye-protective equipment were considered. For the 129 ICs at an average age of 51 who had worked for an average period of 22 years, the estimated cumulative eye lens dose ranged from 25 mSv to more than 1600 mSv; the mean+SD was 423+359 mSv. After several years of practice, without eye protection, ICs may exceed the new ICRP lifetime eye dose threshold of 500 mSv and be at high risk of developing early radiation-induced cataracts. Radiation protection equipment can reduce these doses and should be used routinely. Â© The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.83066034

A model analysis for in vivo tumor growth and radio-response parameters BACKGROUND: Two recent studies have suggested that the probability of local control for early glottic carcinoma (stages T1 and T2) following radiation therapy is lower when daily fractions of 1.8 Gy are given instead of 2.0 Gy when the total dose is kept constant at approximately 66 Gy., METHODS: We reviewed our experience with a total of 42 patients with T1, N0, M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic larynx who were treated with radiation alone during the period 1979 to 1989. All patients received conventional fractionation radiation therapy (one treatment per day, 5 days per week). Eight patients received 2.0 Gy per fraction for an average total dose of 64.8 Gy, and 34 patients received 1.8 Gy per fraction for an average total dose of 66.7 Gy. We also calculated overall survival statistics. Combining the clinical data from our series and those of patients from other series (171 total patients), we analyzed the tumor response curve and doubling time for early glottic carcinoma by using a time-dependent, linear quadratic equation model. The analysis is valid for the typical range of radioresponsiveness for most tumors in healthy tissue., RESULTS: Using statistical z analysis, we noted a significant difference in the local control rates at 5 years, with better local control in the group that received 2.0 Gy per fraction (100% vs 70%). Our results for the calculated doubling time and tumor response curves correspond with experimental values for in vitro squamous cell carcinoma systems., CONCLUSION: It appears from the literature and from our data that the control rates for T1, N0, M0 glottic carcinoma may be significantly improved by using 2.0 Gy per fraction dose vs 1.8 Gy per fraction dose. Our analysis has provided a model of in vivo tumor response of early glottic carcinomas based on reported local control rates using these two different treatment regimens.",Excluded,0.8280654
174,"Reactive oxygen species and DNA damage after ultrasound exposure The aim of this work was to detect the formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals after ultrasound (US) exposure and test the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species induced by ultrasound can contribute to DNA damage. Formation of reactive oxygen species was observed in incubated medium after sonication with 1 MHz continuous ultrasound at the intensities of 0.61-2.44 W/cm2. Free radicals and hydrogen peroxide produced by ultrasound exposure of cells can lead to DNA damage. Comet assay was used to assess the effect of ultrasound on the level of nuclear DNA damage. The nucleated erythrocytes from fish were exposed in vitro to ultrasound at the same intensities and frequency. It was noticed that ultrasound in all used intensities induced DNA damage. The effect was not eliminated by the addition of catalase, which indicates that DNA damage was not caused by hydrogen peroxide only. The results showed that the DNA damage can be repair and this mechanism was the most effective after 30 and 60 min after sonication. Furthermore, the ultrasound-induced DNA damage in the presence of sonosensitizer (Zn- and AlCl-phthalocyanine) was studied.

Patient saliva secretion was recorded, and a visual analog scale measuring overall and daily xerostomia, difficulty in sleeping, speaking, eating and wearing dentures was employed., RESULTS: Pilocarpine, given concomitantly with radiotherapy, statistically improved the salivary flow and induced better patient comfort by the end of radiotherapy. Patient comfort and symptoms related to xerostomia greatly decreased compared to patients receiving pilocarpine after irradiation in the second 6-week period of therapy. The patients' quality of life, saliva production and symptoms related to xerostomia showed significant progress by the end of the 12 weeks., CONCLUSION: The results suggest that stimulated salivary glands suffer less decrease in saliva production during radiotherapy.

BMC of the femur midshaft, representing cortical bone, apparently increased progressively with advancing age. The width of the femur at the scan site also increased with age. Normalizing the midshaft BMC by width partially compensated for the age-associated increase. However, when bone mineral values were normalized by the cortical area at the scan site, to take into account the geometric differences in the femurs of different aged animals, maximum bone densities were found in the mature adult and these values decreased slightly in the femurs from senescent rats. In contrast, the BMC of the femur distal metaphysis, representing trabecular bone, decreased markedly in the aged rat. The loss of trabecular bone was also evident from morphological examination of the distal metaphysis. These findings indicated that bone mineral loss with age was site specific in the rat femur.

In 34 patients with advanced hypopharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, or oropharyngeal cancer, changes in speech from pretreatment to 10 weeks and 1 year posttreatment were correlated with mean doses to the base of tongue (BOT), oral cavity (OC) and tonsillar fossa/soft palate (VP). Differences in anteroposterior tongue position, dorsoventral degree of tongue to palate or pharynx constriction, grooving, strength, nasality, and laryngeal rise, were assessed by acoustic changes in three speech sounds that depend on a (post-) alveolar closure or narrowing (/t/, /s/, /z/), three with a tongue to palate/pharyngeal narrowing (/l/, /r/, /u/), and in vowel /a/ at comfortable and highest pitch. Acoustically assessed changes in tongue positioning, shape, velopharyngeal constriction, and laryngeal elevation were significantly related to mean doses to the tongue and velopharynx. The mean dose to BOT predicted changes in anteroposterior tongue positioning from pre- to 10-weeks posttreatment. From pretreatment to 1-year, mean doses to BOT, OC, and VP were related to changes in grooving, strength, laryngeal height, nasality, palatalization, and degree of pharyngeal constriction.

368,"[Hard x-ray therapy with special reference to postoperative irradiation of breast carcinoma] Five-year-experiences have shown that a considerably intensified tolerance of the skin and an absorption equability of tissues and bones and muscles are obtained with the hard ray roentgen irradiator, RT 305, for half-value depths from 20 mm to 70 mm H-2O and half-value thickness to about 7 mm Cu. By means of a rod anode tube of 300 kV with a super-normal filtration to 3.5 mm Pb, a hard and nearly monochromatic radiation, which already possesses the above mentioned advantages of the ultra-hard ray therapy with an effective energy about 0.2 MeV, appears. The application of this hard ray therapy is given preferably for disease foci in the environment of bone tissues, i.e. in the head and throat, the vertebral column, the osseous pelvic ring and the extremities and as the conventional roentgen therapy ist not able to give it. The hard ray therapy seems to be particularly adapted for the postoperative irradiation of the cancer of the breast with the ribs lying in the region of the irradiation fields, with the sternum and the bones of the shoulder girdle. With regard to these radiotherapeutic possibilities, corresponding cases are demonstrated.",Excluded,0.7959328
175,"Quantification of the chromosomal radiation damage induced by labelling of leukocytes with [18F]FDG Introduction: The aim of our work is to quantify the radiation damage in lymphocytes after labelling with [18F]FDG. Comparison with gold standard [99mTc]HMPAO labelling is established. An approach to cellular dosimetry is proposed. Method(s): Mixed leukocytes were separated from fresh venous blood and labelled with [18F]FDG and [99mTc]HMPAO following published guidelines. Cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay was performed for both sets of experiments. Tests for quality control of labelling described in guidelines were followed. Cellular dosimetry was calculated according to MIRD. Result(s): MN scored after labelling with 37. MBq of [18F]FDG were 956 +/- 172 and 347 +/- 26 for [99mTc]HMPAO (p < 0.05). Absorbed dose in cell nucleus was of 0.23. Gy for [18F]FDG and 0.08. Gy for [99mTc]HMPAO labelling. The CBMN assay after labelling with ~ 290 MBq of [18F]FDG showed radiation induced inhibition of proliferation capacity of the lymphocytes, confirmed by proliferation study. Conclusion(s): [18F]FDG labelling of mixed leukocytes causes severe radiation damage to the cell, higher than with [99mTc]HMPAO in accordance with the absorbed dose. Labelling of mixed leukocytes for clinical purpose induces high cytotoxicity reflected in the loss of proliferation capacity in lymphocytes this statement allows us to consider a low oncogenic risk however the association between MN formation in the PBL and subsequent risk of cancer is not well established. Advances in knowledge: This is the first work about radiation damage with [18F]FDG labelled cells. We focused on [18F]FDG labelling of leukocytes due to the growing number of research and review articles about this technique. Implications for patient care: The possibility of an increased risk of lymphoid malignancies associated with the administration of radiolabelled lymphocytes is a very controversial subject. Studies on radiation damage on new labelling procedures as the one exposed in this work must be considered.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc..",Excluded,0.7913926
1038,"Endovascular beta-radiation to reduce restenosis after coronary balloon angioplasty: Results of the beta energy restenosis trial (BERT) Background - In the porcine overstretch injury model of restenosis, endovascular beta-radiation reduces neointima formation. To determine whether this therapy could be applied to patients with coronary artery disease, a special device was developed to allow delivery of 12 encapsulated 90Sr/Y sources, measuring a total of 30 mm, to various sites within the coronary arterial tree. This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of the delivery of 12, 14, or 16 Gy at 2 mm after balloon angioplasty of stenoses of native coronary vessels. Methods and Results - Delivery of beta-radiation was attempted in 23 patients after successful balloon angioplasty. Source delivery was successful in 21 of the 23 patients (91%). There was no in- hospital or 30-day morbidity or mortality. Follow-up quantitative coronary arteriography in 20 patients demonstrated a late loss of 0.05 mm, a late loss index of 4%, and a restenosis rate of 15%. The use of the beta-emitter 90Sr/Y significantly reduced treatment time and operator exposure compared with previous trials with the gamma-emitter 192Ir. Conclusions - In this study, the administration of endovascular beta-radiation after angioplasty was safe and feasible and substantially altered the postangioplasty late lumen loss, resulting in a lower-than-expected rate of restenosis. On the basis of these encouraging results, a multicenter, randomized trial with operators and patients blinded to treatment assignment is planned.",Excluded,0.79104257

It has been reported that decreasing the surface dose reduces patient morbidity, especially facial weakness and numbness. The authors of this retrospective study examine patient data from a single center to determine if low-dose ( 14 Gy). METHOD(S): Based on the formula for ellipsoid volumes, the tumor volumes were calculated using measurements from MR images obtained at follow up in patients treated at the authors' center. Follow-up data were available in 159 patients with a mean age of 59.5 +/- 14.2 years at treatment. Fifty-six percent of the patients were women and 53.5% of the tumors were located on the right side of the brain. The mean tumor volume was 3.3 +/- 4.3 cm3 with 10% of the tumors having volumes larger than 8 cm3. After GKS, smaller tumors (> or = 40% decrease in volume) were observed in 44.8% of patients treated with a low dose and in 48.8% treated with a high dose. Enlarged tumors (> or = 40% increase in volume) were seen in 5.2% of the patients receiving a low dose and 2.3% of those receiving a high dose. These differences were not statistically significant. Patients who had been followed up for longer than 5 years after treatment had median residual volumes of only 28.2% of the starting volume in the low-dose group and 26% in the high-dose group. This difference was statistically not significant.

Method(s): Consecutive RA patients (n = 100) were matched (age and sex) with controls (1:2). The follow-up period began at the index date, defined as the date of diagnosis for RA patients and the date of the first medical claim at the Health Management Organization (HMO) for non-RA patients. Fracture incidence rates per 1000 persons-years (PY) for distinct types of fractures were calculated. Multivariate cox regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with fractures. Result(s): One hundred RA patients were followed for a total of 975.1 patients-years and 200 controls for 1485.7 patients-years. No difference was found in the overall fracture incidence rate per 1000 PY between RA and controls (19.5, 95% CI 12.7-28.6 vs 12.1, 95% CI 7.7-18.7, p = 0.07). In the Cox regression analysis, only age (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.11, p = 0.006) and history of a prior fracture (HR 9.85, 95% CI 2.97-32.64, p < 0.001) were associated with fractures after the index date. The stratified analysis of the fractures by location showed that only the vertebral fractures were more frequent in RA patients compared with controls (12.9 per 1000 PY, 95% CI 8.9-25.8, vs. 3.4, 95% CI 1.4-8.1, respectively, p = 0.01).

505,"Irradiation of cochlear structures during vestibular schwannoma radiosurgery and associated hearing outcome Object. The purpose of this study was to measure the dose of radiation delivered to the cochlea during a Gamma knife surgery (GKS) procedure for treatment of patients with vestibular schwannomas (VSs), and to analyze the relationship between cochlear irradiation and the hearing outcome of these patients. Methods. Eighty-two patients with VSs were treated with GKS using a marginal dose of 12 Gy. No patient had neurofibromatosis Type 2 disease, and all had a Gardner-Robertson hearing class of I to IV before treatment, and a radiological and audiological follow-up of at least 1-year after GKS. The dosimetric data of the volume of the cochlea were retrospectively analyzed and were correlated with the auditory outcome of patients. Results. The mean radiation dose delivered to the cochlear volume ranged from 1.30 to 10.00 Gy (median 4.15 Gy). The cochlea received significantly higher radiation doses in patients with worsening of hearing after GKS. A highly significant association between the cochlear and the intracanalicular dose of radiation delivered during GKS was found. Conclusions. During GKS for VSs, relatively high doses of radiation can be delivered to the cochlea. Worsening of hearing after GKS can be the consequence of either radiation injury to the cochlea or the irradiation dose delivered into the auditory canal, or both.",Excluded,0.7682967

However, to date, there is no studies quantifying the effective dose during MIS-TLIF procedure, and the radiation dose distribution is still unclear. In this study, the surgeons' radiation doses at 5 places on the bodies were measured and the effective doses were assessed during 31 consecutive 1- to 3-level MIS-TLIF surgeries. The operating surgeon, assisting surgeon, and radiological technologist wore thermoluminescent dosimeter on the unshielded thyroid, chest, genitals, right middle finger, and on the chest beneath a lead apron. The doses at the lens and the effective doses were also calculated. Mean fluoroscopy times were 38.7, 53.1, and 58.5 seconds for 1, 2, or 3 fusion levels, respectively. The operating surgeon's mean exposures at the lens, thyroid, chest, genitals, finger, and the chest beneath the shield, respectively, were 0.07, 0.07, 0.09, 0.14, 0.32, and 0.05 mSv in 1-level MIS-TLIF; 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.18, 0.34, and 0.05 mSv in 2-level; 0.08, 0.09, 0.14, 0.15, 0.36, and 0.06 mSv in 3-level; and 0.07, 0.08, 0.10, 0.15, 0.33, and 0.05 mSv in all cases. Mean dose at the operating surgeon's right finger was significantly higher than other measurements parts (P,0.001).

The objective of our study was to determine whether the 2 dose components are sufficiently well correlated to enable estimating total dose from blood work alone. Methods Data were examined retrospectively for all pts studied from 2004 - 2015. An uncollimated gamma camera measured anterior & posterior counts (corrected for background & decay & calibrated by I-131 standards) 6 times over 5 days after administration of 37-74 MBq I-131 to estimate dose to blood from gamma emissions (Dgamma). Blood was sampled within 10 min of each camera measurement, well counter counts of which estimated dose to blood from beta emissions (Dbeta). Adding these 2 estimates provided total dose (DT) to blood forming organs, adjusted for body habitus. Predicted total dose (DP) was obtained from Dbeta alone by linear regression. Conventional MPA was computed as 200 rad/DT & predicted MPA as 200 rad/DP. Results There were 62 pts (age = 61+/-12 yrs; 30 female; 32 male), of whom 2 were studied twice & 3 were studied 3 times, for a total of 68 measurements. DT was progressively larger for pts studied multiple times (rank correlation rho = 0.39, p = 0.004). DP was computed as = -0.005+1.473* Dbeta, & correlated strongly with DT (r = 0.98, p < 0.0001; intercept = 0.04+/-0.02, p = 0.09; slope = 0.95+/-0.02, p < 0.0001), with similar means (0.76+/-0.51 versus 0.76+/-0.52 rad/mCi, paired t-test p = 0.96).

943,"Glypican-3-mediated inhibition of CD26 by TFPI: a novel mechanism in hematopoietic stem cell homing and maintenance Directional migration determines hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) homing, which depends upon the interaction between the chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4. CD26 is a widely expressed membrane-bound ectopeptidase that cleaves CXCL12 thereby depleting its chemokine activity. We identified tissue-factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) as a biological inhibitor of CD26 in murine and human HSPCs. We observed low-level TFPI expression in endothelial cells in the bone marrow (BM), which did not increase following radiation injury. Treatment of HSPCs with TFPI in vitro led to enhanced HSPC migration toward CXCL12, as well as homing and engraftment in the BM upon transplantation. We found that Glypican-3 (GPC3), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on murine as well as human HSPCs, mediated this effect. TFPI did not affect CD26 activity, migration, or homing of GPC3(-/-) HSPCs, while it affected GPC1(-/-) HSPCs similar to wild-type HSPCs. Moreover, proliferation of GPC3(-/-) but not GPC1(-/-) BM HSPCs was significantly increased, which was associated with a decrease in the primitive HSC pool in BM and an increase in proportion of the circulating HSPCs in the peripheral blood. Hence, we present a novel role for TFPI and GPC3 in regulating HSC homing as well as retention in the BM.",Excluded,0.6374873

Identifying patients who might be at increased risk for normal tissue toxicity would help in determination of the optimal radiation dose to avoid these events. We profiled 59 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 37 inflammation-related genes in 173 NSCLC patients with stage IIIA/IIIB (dry) disease who were treated with definitive radiation or chemoradiation. For esophagitis risk, nine SNPs were associated with a 1.5- to 4-fold increase in risk, including three PTGS2 (COX2) variants: rs20417 (HR:1.93, 95% CI:1.10-3.39), rs5275 (HR:1.58, 95% CI:1.09-2.27), and rs689470 (HR:3.38, 95% CI:1.09-10.49). Significantly increased risk of pneumonitis was observed for patients with genetic variation in the proinflammatory genes IL1A, IL8, TNF, TNFRSF1B, and MIF. In contrast, NOS3:rs1799983 displayed a protective effect with a 45% reduction in pneumonitis risk (HR:0.55, 95% CI:0.31-0.96). Pneumonitis risk was also modulated by polymorphisms in anti-inflammatory genes, including genetic variation in IL13. rs20541 and rs180925 each resulted in increased risk (HR:2.95, 95% CI:1.14-7.63 and HR:3.23, 95% CI:1.03-10.18, respectively). The cumulative effect of these SNPs on risk was dose-dependent, as evidenced by a significantly increased risk of either toxicity with an increasing number of risk genotypes (P,0.001). These results suggest that genetic variations among inflammation pathway genes may modulate the development of radiation-induced toxicity and, ultimately, help in identifying patients who are at an increased likelihood for such events. 2010 Hildebrandt et al.",Excluded,0.60577136

We developed a new protocol using hematopoietic growth factors prior to low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) in recipients of autologous transplants to establish high levels of long-term donor cell engraftment. We hypothesized that treatment of recipient mice with growth factors would selectively deplete stem cells, resulting in successful long-term donor cell engraftment after transplantation. Recipient mice were treated for 1 or 7 days with growth factors (stem cell factor [SCF] plus interleukin 11 [IL-11], SCF plus Flt-3 ligand [FL], or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) prior to low-dose TBI (4 Gy). Donor cell chimerism was measured after transplantation of congenic bone marrow cells. High levels of donor cell engraftment were observed in recipients pretreated for 7 days with SCF plus IL-11 or SCF plus FL. Although 1-day pretreatments with these cytokines initially resulted in reduced donor cell engraftment, a continuous increase in time was observed, finally resulting in highly significantly increased levels of donor cell contribution. In contrast, G-CSF treatment showed no beneficial effects on long-term engraftment. In vitro stem cell assays demonstrated the effect of cytokine treatment on stem cell numbers. Donor cell engraftment and number of remaining recipient stem cells after TBI were strongly inversely correlated, except for groups treated for 1 day with SCF plus IL-11 or SCF plus FL.

No association with brain tumours was observed when comparing regular mobile phone users with non-users (OR=1.24; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.77 for gliomas, OR=0.90; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.34 for meningiomas). However, the positive association was statistically significant in the heaviest users when considering life-long cumulative duration (>=896 h, OR=2.89; 95% CI 1.41 to 5.93 for gliomas; OR=2.57; 95% CI 1.02 to 6.44 for meningiomas) and number of calls for gliomas (>=18 360 calls, OR=2.10, 95% CI 1.03 to 4.31). Risks were higher for gliomas, temporal tumours, occupational and urban mobile phone use. Conclusion(s): These additional data support previous findings concerning a possible association between heavy mobile phone use and brain tumours.",Excluded,0.55613893
687,"The thermal effects of therapeutic lasers with 810 and 904 nm wavelengths on human skin OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of therapeutic infrared class 3B laser irradiation on skin temperature in healthy participants of differing skin color, age, and gender., BACKGROUND: Little is known about the potential thermal effects of Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) irradiation on human skin., METHODS: Skin temperature was measured in 40 healthy volunteers with a thermographic camera at laser irradiated and control (non-irradiated) areas on the skin. Six irradiation doses (2-12 J) were delivered from a 200 mW, 810 nm laser and a 60 mW, 904 nm laser, respectively., RESULTS: Thermal effects of therapeutic LLLT using doses recommended in the World Association for Laser Therapy (WALT) guidelines were insignificant; below 1.5degreeC in light, medium, and dark skin. When higher irradiation doses were used, the 60 mW, 904 nm laser produced significantly (p < 0.01) higher temperatures in dark skin (5.7, SD +/- 1.8degreeC at 12 J) than in light skin, although no participants requested termination of LLLT. However, irradiation with a 200 mW, 810 nm laser induced three to six times more heat in dark skin than in the other skin color groups. Eight of 13 participants with dark skin asked for LLLT to be stopped because of uncomfortable heating. The maximal increase in skin temperature was 22.3degreeC., CONCLUSIONS: The thermal effects of LLLT at doses recommended by WALT-guidelines for musculoskeletal and inflammatory conditions are negligible (<1.5degreeC) in light, medium, and dark skin. However, higher LLLT doses delivered with a strong 3B laser (200 mW) are capable of increasing skin temperature significantly and these photothermal effects may exceed the thermal pain threshold for humans with dark skin color.",Excluded,0.5291537
105,"The early causal influence of cell size upon synaptic number: the mutant gigas of Drosophila The number of synaptic contacts formed by a neuron is known to vary with its surface area. This could be because large neurons are able to establish more synaptic sites, or because those neurons that are able to establish more sites are subsequently able to enlarge. To test between these two possibilities clones of enlarged ommatidia were generated in the retina of the Drosophila mutant gigas, by mitotic recombination following gamma-irradiation in the third-instar larva. The numbers of afferent synaptic contacts formed by the photoreceptor terminals in the first optic neuropil, or lamina, were then counted in the adult. The terminals of mutant photoreceptors were also enlarged, but by varying degrees. The sizes of their profiles in single sections merged with the size distribution of terminals having a wild-type phenotype, lying outside the clone in the same lamina. A perimeter of 6.0 microns for the profiles of receptor terminal in cross section was established as a criterion for distinguishing between normal and mutant phenotypes. The mutant terminals had more presynaptic sites. Because only the gigas terminals are mutant and because they enlarged at a time long before synapse formation occurred in the lamina we may conclude that cell enlargement preceded elevated synaptic number. The increase in synaptic number roughly matched the increased membrane surface of the terminals, so as nearly to preserve a constant areal density of synaptic sites over a 5-fold range in synaptic frequency.",Excluded,0.5044725
