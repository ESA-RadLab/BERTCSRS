185,"Lack of high-dose radiation mediated prostate cancer promotion and low-dose radiation adaptive response in the TRAMP mouse model Cancer of the prostate is a highly prevalent disease with a heterogeneous aetiology and prognosis. Current understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the responses of prostate tissue to ionizing radiation exposure, including cancer induction, is surprisingly limited for both high- and low-dose exposures. As population exposure to radiation increases, largely through medical imaging, a better understanding of the response of the prostate to radiation exposure is required. Low-dose radiation-induced adaptive responses for increased cancer latency and decreased cancer frequency have been demonstrated in mouse models, largely for hematological cancers. This study examines the effects of high- and low-dose whole-body radiation exposure on prostate cancer development using an autochthonous mouse model of prostate cancer: TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP). TRAMP mice were exposed to single acute high (2 Gy), low (50 mGy) and repeated low (5 x 50 mGy) doses of X rays to evaluate both the potential prostate cancer promoting effects of high-dose radiation and low-dose adaptive response phenomena in this prostate cancer model. Prostate weights and histopathology were examined to evaluate gross changes in cancer development and, in mice exposed to a single 2 Gy dose, time to palpable tumor was examined. Proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis, DNA damage (gamma-H2AX) and transgene expression (large T-antigen) were examined within TRAMP prostate sections. Neither high- nor low-dose radiation-induced effects on prostate cancer progression were observed for any of the endpoints studied. Lack of observable effects of high- or low-dose radiation exposure suggests that modulation of tumorigenesis in the TRAMP model is largely resistant to such exposures. However, further study is required to better assess the effects of radiation exposure using alternative prostate cancer models that incorporate normal prostate and in those that are not driven by SV40 large T antigen. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.9738032
173,"Evaluation of the genotoxic effects of chronic low-dose ionizing radiation exposure on nuclear medicine workers INTRODUCTION: Nuclear medicine workers are occupationally exposed to chronic ionizing radiation. It is known that ionizing radiation may have damaging effects on chromosomes. In the present study, we investigated the genotoxic effects of ionizing radiation on nuclear medicine workers. We used two different indicators of genotoxicity methods: sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronucleus (MN)., METHODS: The present research was carried out using 21 nuclear medicine workers (11 females and 10 males) during two periods: during normal working conditions and after a 1-month vacation. The radiation dose varied from 1.20 to 48.56 mSv, which accumulated during the occupational exposure time between two vacations. Peripheral blood samples were taken from each subject for two distinct lymphocyte cultures (SCE and MN) in each period., RESULTS: In nearly all subjects, SCE values increased significantly during radiation exposure compared to the postvacation period (P<.05). Similarly, MN frequencies in most of the subjects increased significantly during radiation exposure compared to the postvacation period (P<.05)., CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that both SCE and MN frequencies in most of the subjects were significantly higher during exposure to ionizing radiation than after a 1-month vacation period. However, this genotoxic effect was reversible in most of the subjects.",Excluded,0.9737898
184,"Brain and arterial abnormalities following prenatal X-ray irradiation in mice assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and angiography The present study aimed to quantitatively characterize changes in the whole brain and arterial morphology in response to prenatal ionizing irradiation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography (MRA) were used to evaluate brain and arterial abnormalities in 8-week-old male mice prenatally exposed to X-ray radiation at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 Gy on embryonic day (E) 13. Irradiated mice demonstrated decreased brain volume, increased ventricular volume, and arterial malformation. Additionally, MRA signal intensity and arterial thickness in the anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and basilar artery were lower in radiation-exposed mice than in control mice. MRI and MRA are useful tools for assessing brain and arterial abnormalities after prenatal exposure to radiation.Copyright © 2014 Japanese Teratology Society.",Excluded,0.97357225
313,"HPRT-mutant frequency and lymphocyte characteristics of workers exposed to ionizing radiation on a sporadic basis: a comparison of two exposure indicators, job title and dose Using the clonal HPRT-mutant frequency assay, mutant frequencies of humans have been shown to rise following exposure to large doses of mutagens during radiotherapy, chemotherapy or after an atom bomb explosion. Success in relating mutant frequencies to exposure to high levels of mutagens has encouraged researchers to examine the effects of lower doses, such as those found among workers exposed at their jobs. In order to relate low doses of mutagens to biological effects, accurate characterization of exposure is critical, but most occupational studies are forced to use gross measures of exposure derived from job title or professional judgments as to potential exposure. Mutant frequencies and other relevant lymphocyte characteristics of 58 industrial workers were related to exposure status in two ways. When workers were classed as ""exposed"" or ""unexposed"" to ionizing radiation, no difference in any biological variable was seen between the two groups. When dosimeter readings were used as the exposure indicator, significant relationships appeared between dose and mutant frequency and CD4/CD8 lymphocyte subpopulation ratios. Mutant frequency was also positively related to age and smoking status. The time course of exposure and of appearance of mutant cells is discussed and it is suggested that this relationship receive attention in occupational studies of genotoxic effects.",Excluded,0.9735501
317,"Dose-dependent expression of CLIP2 in post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid carcinomas A previous study on papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) in young patients who were exposed to 131iodine from the Chernobyl fallout revealed an exclusive gain of chromosomal band 7q11.23 in exposed cases compared to an age-matched control cohort. CLIP2, a gene located within band 7q11.23 was shown to be differentially expressed between exposed and non-exposed cases at messenger RNA and protein level. Therefore, a standardized procedure for CLIP2 typing of PTCs has been developed in a follow-up study. Here we used CLIP2 typing data on 117 post-Chernobyl PTCs from two cohorts of exposed patients with individual dose estimates and 24 non-exposed controls to investigate a possible quantitative dose-response relationship of the CLIP2 marker. The 'Genrisk-T' cohort consisted of 45 PTCs and the 'UkrAm' cohort of 72 PTCs. Both cohorts differed in mean dose (0.59 Gy Genrisk-T, 1.2 Gy UkrAm) and mean age at exposure (AaE) (2 years Genrisk-T, 8 years UkrAm), whilst the median latency (16 years Genrisk-T, 18 years UkrAm) was comparable. We analyzed the association between the binary CLIP2 typing and continuous thyroid dose with logistic regression. A clear positive dose-response relationship was found for young PTC cases [age at operation (AaO) < 20 years, AaE < 5 years]. In the elder age group a higher proportion of sporadic tumors is assumed due to a negligible dose response, suggesting different molecular mechanisms in sporadic and radiation-induced cases. This is further supported by the association of elder patients (AaO > 20 years) with positivity for BRAF V600E mutation.Copyright © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

986,"Effect of thoracic irradiation on hepatocyte growth factor in rats lung and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with thoracic malignancies This study aimed to examine the physiological role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) after thoracic irradiation. We analysed the changes of HGF protein levels in rat lung following 12 Gy of whole thoracic irradiation. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was then collected from 11 patients (10 lung cancer and one oesophageal cancer) after completion of radiation therapy. One month after irradiation, the HGF protein level in the lungs of irradiated rats decreased (p<0.05), followed by a remarkable elevation in HGF protein levels 2 (p<0.05) and 3 months (nonsignificant) after irradiation accompanied by the clinical appearance of radiation pneumonitis. Finally, HGF protein levels in the lung returned to their original level 6 months after thoracic irradiation. In humans, HGF protein levels in the BALF in the limited irradiated area were lower than those obtained from unirradiated areas (p<0.05). In conclusion, hepatocyte growth factor production is transiently suppressed in the irradiated area after irradiation.",Excluded,0.97326994
131,"Comparative study of DNA damage and repair in head and neck cancer after radiation treatment We compared DNA damage and the efficacy of its repair after genotoxic treatment with gamma-radiation of lymphocytes and tissue cells isolated from patients with squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (HNSCC) and healthy donors. Thirty-seven subjects with HNSCC and 35 healthy donors were enrolled in the study. The extent of DNA damage including oxidative lesions and efficiency of the repair were examined by alkaline comet assay. HNSCC cancer cells were more sensitive to genotoxic treatment and displayed impaired DNA repair. In particular, lesions caused by gamma-radiation were repaired less effectively in metastasis of HNSCC than in healthy controls. The differences in radiation sensitivity of cancer and control cells suggested that DNA repair might be critical for HNSCC treatment. We conclude that gamma-radiation might be considered as an effective therapeutic strategy for head and neck cancers, including patients in advanced stage of the disease with clear evidence of metastasis.",Excluded,0.97326976
847,"Radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes after partial-body exposure to 60Co gamma-irradiation and in vitro exposure to 230 kV X-irradiation Small yields of chromosome aberrations were present in lymphocytes from 12 patients observed at first metaphase in culbure. Blood samples were obtained at various times, up to three days, after single partial-body therapeutic exposure ranging from 75 to 400 rads of 60Co gamma-irradiation. When all patients were considered there was no correlation between treatment dose and aberration frequency, but on subdivision into two groups on the basis of whether the reticuloendothelial system was involved in the cancer, linear regression analysis could be fitted to the data for each group. An in vitro dose response curve for dicentrics induced by 230 kV X rays at a dose rate of 23.3 rads per minute was constructed for use as a standard calibration curve for 48 hour cultures. The yield of dicentric aberrations was best fitted by a power law model, Y = kDn in which k = (1.59 +/- 0.66) 10(-4) and n= 1.49 +/- 0.08, (P =0.96).",Excluded,0.9732562
502,"Mortality among individuals exposed to atomic bomb radiation in utero: 1950-2012 We examined the mortality risks among 2463 individuals who were exposed in utero to atomic bomb radiation in Hiroshima or Nagasaki in August 1945 and were followed from October 1950 through 2012. Individual estimates of mother's weighted absorbed uterine dose (DS02R1) were used. Poisson regression method was used to estimate the radiation-associated excess relative risk per Gy (ERR/Gy) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cause-specific mortality. Head size, birth weight, and parents' survival status were evaluated as potential mediators of radiation effect. There were 339 deaths (216 males and 123 females) including deaths from solid cancer (n = 137), lymphohematopoietic cancer (n = 8), noncancer disease (n = 134), external cause (n = 56), and unknown cause (n = 4). Among males, the unadjusted ERR/Gy (95% CI) was increased for noncancer disease mortality (1.22, 0.10-3.14), but not for solid cancer mortality (- 0.18, < - 0.77-0.95); the unadjusted ERR/Gy for external cause mortality was not statistically significant (0.28, < - 0.60-2.36). Among females, the unadjusted ERRs/Gy were increased for solid cancer (2.24, 0.44-5.58), noncancer (2.86, 0.56-7.64), and external cause mortality (2.57, 0.20-9.19). The ERRs/Gy adjusted for potential mediators did not change appreciably for solid cancer mortality, but decreased notably for noncancer mortality (0.39, < - 0.43-1.91 for males; 1.48, - 0.046-4.55 for females) and external cause mortality (0.10, < - 0.57-1.96 for males; 1.38, < - 0.46-5.95 for females). In conclusion, antenatal radiation exposure is a consistent risk factor for increased solid cancer mortality among females, but not among males. The effect of exposure to atomic bomb radiation on noncancer disease and external cause mortality among individuals exposed in utero was mediated through small head size, low birth weight, and parental loss.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.97314847
472,"A sentinel case series of cancer patients with occupational exposures to electromagnetic non-ionizing radiation and other agents Background. There are reports that intense prolonged occupational exposure to non-ionizing radiation may increase risks for cancer. We previously have reported a sentinel cluster, of 7 workers with high exposures and short latent periods, and individual patients with brain cancer high occupational exposures and short latent periods. We present a sentinel case series (n=47, 40M, 7F) of cancer patients, referred to our medical unit with occupational exposures to non-ionizing radiation of all types. Objectives. Our aims were to report the findings on tumour types, age of first diagnosis, and latency, to describe their exposures and to examine the hypothesis that latencies for all tumour types (solid tissue, hematolymphatic, testicular) were coherently related to high occupational exposures starting at young ages. Methods. We divided the patients into groups by latency. We categorized each patient's exposures in regard to types of radiation, far or near field exposure and direct body contact. For some we had data on frequencies, for others we provided assessments. We also present the patient data categorized by age of diagnosis.We used a case-case type comparison to examine latencies for tumour types [solid, hematolymphatic (HL), testicular]. Results. 15 patients developed cancer with latent periods of less than 5 years and 12 patients with latent periods between 5 and 10 years. The remaining 20 patients had longer latent periods between first occupational exposure to EMF and diagnosis of cancer. 6 patients (12.7%) had multiple tumours. 12 patients (25.5%) reported cancer cases in co-workers. In the <5 years latency group there were 8 hematolymphatic cancers, 3 testicular cancers and 6 solid tumours [head & neck (including brain) and GI tract]. In all latency groups there were patients who were exposed to intense levels of electromagnetic fields (EMF), to several types of EMF, or to EMF in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) or other exposures, and patients who had direct body contact with the equipment, were in direct focus of high radiation, or worked in small, electronically dense environments. Case classification by age showed shorter latencies with younger ages, but this association is complicated by the fact that shorter latencies co-vary with younger ages especially for testicular tumours. But patients with testicular and hematolymphatic tumours had shorter latencies than those with solid tumours. Conclusion. Many of the patients were young and had extremely short latent periods, especially for HL and testicular cancers. The fact that latent periods for testes were very short, HL longer and solid still longer suggests a coherent and biologically plausible pattern of latency in relation to the onset of exposure to EMF and other agents. The findings strengthen the hypothesis that these exposures may possibly be the major cause of many of these tumours. The findings state the case for (1) better modelling of exposure sources and penetration into the body and (2) preventive and protective measures based on control of exposure at source, barriers, and personal protection.",Excluded,0.9730113
1120,"Impact of chemical exposure on cancer mortality in a French cohort of uranium processing workers Background: Nuclear workers may be exposed to a variety of chemical hazards, in addition to radiation. We examined the effect of chemical exposures on cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers at the AREVA NC Pierrelatte facility. Method(s): A cohort of 2,897 uranium processing workers employed for at least 6 months was followed from 1968 through 2006. Exposure to uranium and potentially carcinogenic chemicals was assessed with a plant-specific job-exposure matrix. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for cancers of the lung, lymphohematopoietic system, kidney and bladder, brain and central nervous system (BCNS), and prostate were estimated for each specific chemical exposure, with Cox regression models stratified for sex and calendar period and adjusted for socioeconomic status. Additional adjustments enabled us to examine the effect of co-exposure to uranium and other chemicals. Result(s): Exposure to aromatic solvents was associated with increased risk of BCNS malignancies after adjustment for other chemicals (HR=6.53, 95% CI=1.14-37.41; n=6) and for other chemicals and uranium (HR=7.26, 95% CI=0.90-58.19) in the annual exposure status model. Selected groups of lymphohematopoietic cancers were found associated with solvent exposure. Inconclusive results were found regarding chromium (VI) exposure, since only 2 workers died from lung cancer among 109 exposed. Conclusion(s): Based on our pilot study, it seemed important to take into account chemical exposures in the analyses of cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers. Am. J. Ind.

596,"Radiation-induced micro-RNA expression changes in peripheral blood cells of radiotherapy patients Purpose: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding small RNAs that regulate gene expression, are involved in numerous physiologic processes in normal and malignant cells. Our in vivo study measured miRNA and gene expression changes in human blood cells in response to ionizing radiation, to develop miRNA signatures that can be used as biomarkers for radiation exposure. Methods and Materials: Blood from 8 radiotherapy patients in complete remission 1 or 2 was collected immediately before and 4 hours after total body irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays. Both miRNA and gene expression changes were measured by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction and microarray hybridization, respectively. Hierarchic clustering, multidimensional scaling, class prediction, and gene ontology analysis were performed to investigate the potential of miRNAs to serve as radiation biomarkers and to elucidate their likely physiologic roles in the radiation response. Result(s): The expression levels of 45 miRNAs were statistically significantly upregulated 4 hours after irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays, 27 of them in every patient. Nonirradiated and irradiated samples form separate clusters in hierarchic clustering and multidimensional scaling. Out of 223 differentially expressed genes, 37 were both downregulated and predicted targets of the upregulated miRNAs. Paired and unpaired miRNA-based classifiers that we developed can predict the class membership of a sample with unknown irradiation status, with accuracies of 100% when all 45 upregulated miRNAs are included. Both miRNA control of and gene involvement in biologic processes such as hemopoiesis and the immune response are increased after irradiation, whereas metabolic processes are underrepresented among all differentially expressed genes and the genes controlled by miRNAs. Conclusion(s): Exposure to ionizing radiation leads to the upregulation of the expression of a considerable proportion of the human miRNAome of peripheral blood cells. These miRNA expression signatures can be used as biomarkers of radiation exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.9728913
815,"The development and biological characteristics of a novel potentially radioresistant inbred mouse strain The growth of biomedical research over the previous decades has been accompanied by an increase in the number, complexity and diversity of experimental animals developed as research tools, and inbred mice are some of the most widely used. However, thus far, no inbred mice have exhibited strong radioresistance for use in radiation-damage research. To develop a radioresistant mouse model, a female Japanese outbreeding strain ICR/JCL mouse was mated with a male Chinese inbred strain 615 mouse. From the F1 generation, the mouse line was maintained by brother-to-sister mating. A novel mouse strain was established over >20 continuous generations and designated the Institute of Radiation Medicine-2 (IRM-2) mouse. The biological characteristics, genetic characteristics and susceptibility to radiation of these mice were determined. The IRM-2 mice inherited traits from the parents, including strong reproductive capacity, stable physiological and biochemical indices and few differences among individuals. According to the genetic results, the IRM-2 mice exhibited homozygosity, isogenicity and consistency, in agreement with international standards for inbred strains. Radiosensitivity studies have previously suggested that the lethal dose (LD)50 values for IRM-2 mice were 7.17 Gy (male) and 7.5 Gy (female), resulting in a dose reduction factor value of 1.39 (male) and 1.37 (female). The mortality of IRM-2 mice irradiated with 8 Gy total body irradiation was 15% at day 9 and 90% at day 15 after radiation. The number of nucleated cells in bone marrow, DNA content and colony-forming unit-spleen counts in IRM-2 mice after exposure to gamma-ray irradiation were markedly higher than the corresponding values for the parental strains, suggesting that the IRM-2 mice exhibit high resistance to ionizing radiation. Thus, it is suggested that this novel inbred mouse strain may be developed as an animal model of radioresistance for future use in radiation research.",Excluded,0.9724821

Relationships between specific NF-kappaB gene networks, leukemogenesis, and radiation exposure are still unknown. Our aim was to study the expression levels of the NF-kappaB1, NF-kappaB2, and Rel genes in hematological malignancies in the post-Chernobyl period.

The quantitative transmission of Litomosoides carinii to un-irradiated and irradiated golden hamsters and white mice The quantitative transmission of Litomosoides carinii by Liponyssus bacoti to un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters and mice is described. Both young and adult, un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters were highly susceptible to L. carinii but mice (un-irradiated or irradiated) were poor hosts. All hamsters (18 un-irradiated and seven irradiated) became infected. Seven out of nine mice in an un-irradiated series became infected. There was apparently 'age resistance' or 'young susceptibility' in the hamsters. The susceptibility of young hamsters appeared similar to that of new-born Carworth white rats and cotton rats. The pattern of infection in un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters was similar. Results from irradiated animals were insufficient to draw any clear conclusions on the effect of irradiation to susceptibility to infection with L. carinii.

710,"Evaluation of endogenous control gene(s) for gene expression studies in human blood exposed to 60Co gamma-rays ex vivo In gene expression studies, it is critical to normalize data using a stably expressed endogenous control gene in order to obtain accurate and reliable results. However, we currently do not have a universally applied endogenous control gene for normalization of data for gene expression studies, particularly those involving (60)Co gamma-ray-exposed human blood samples. In this study, a comparative assessment of the gene expression of six widely used housekeeping endogenous control genes, namely 18S, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, MT-ATP6 and CDKN1A, was undertaken for a range of (60)Co gamma-ray doses (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 Gy) at 8.4 Gy min(-1) at 0 and 24 h post-irradiation time intervals. Using the NormFinder algorithm, real-time PCR data obtained from six individuals (three males and three females) were analyzed with respect to the threshold cycle (Ct) value and abundance, DELTACt pair-wise comparison, intra- and inter-group variability assessments, etc. GAPDH, either alone or in combination with 18S, was found to be the most suitable endogenous control gene and should be used in gene expression studies, especially those involving qPCR of gamma-ray-exposed human blood samples.

950,"RAD18 mediates resistance to ionizing radiation in human glioma cells Radioresistance remains a major challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). RAD18 a central regulator of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), has been shown to play an important role in regulating genomic stability and DNA damage response. In the present study, we investigate the relationship between RAD18 and resistance to ionizing radiation (IR) and examined the expression levels of RAD18 in primary and recurrent GBM specimens. Our results showed that RAD18 is an important mediator of the IR-induced resistance in GBM. The expression level of RAD18 in glioma cells correlates with their resistance to IR. Ectopic expression of RAD18 in RAD18-low A172 glioma cells confers significant resistance to IR treatment. Conversely, depletion of endogenous RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells sensitized these cells to IR treatment. Moreover, RAD18 overexpression confers resistance to IR-mediated apoptosis in RAD18-low A172 glioma cells, whereas cells deficient in RAD18 exhibit increased apoptosis induced by IR. Furthermore, knockdown of RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells disrupts HR-mediated repair, resulting in increased accumulation of DSB. In addition, clinical data indicated that RAD18 was significantly higher in recurrent GBM samples that were exposed to IR compared with the corresponding primary GBM samples. Collectively, our findings reveal that RAD18 may serve as a key mediator of the IR response and may function as a potential target for circumventing IR resistance in human GBM.

An experimental autoallergic sialadenitis (EAS) of the rat submandibular gland was developed to serve as the standard lesion. Consistently mild or severe lesions of EAS were induced in male Lewis rats when they were immunized with allogeneic submandibular glands from sexually immature or mature female donors, respectively.

946,"Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase Upregulation by Phenylephrine Reduces Radiation Injury in Submandibular Gland PURPOSE: Radiation therapy for head and neck cancer commonly leads to radiation sialadenitis. Emerging evidence has indicated that phenylephrine pretreatment reduces radiosensitivity in the salivary gland; however, the underlying cytoprotective mechanism remains unclear. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is not only a key enzyme for the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide salvage pathway, but also a cytokine participating in cell survival, metabolism, and longevity, with a broad effect on cellular functions in physiology and pathology. However, the regulatory events of NAMPT in response to the irradiated salivary gland are unknown., METHODS AND MATERIALS: The cell viability of primary cultured submandibular gland cells was determined using the PrestoBlue assay. NAMPT expression was measured using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting in vitro and in vivo. Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and phosphorylated Akt protein levels were examined by Western blotting. The cellular locations of NAMPT and SIRT1 were detected by immunohistochemistry. NAMPT promoter activity was assessed using the luciferase reporter gene assay., RESULTS: NAMPT was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of granular convoluted tubule cells and ductal cells in normal submandibular glands. mRNA and protein expression of NAMPT was downregulated after radiation but upregulated with phenylephrine pretreatment both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the protein expression of phosphorylated Akt and SIRT1 was decreased in irradiated glands, and phenylephrine pretreatment restored the expression of both. SIRT1 was mainly located in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm in the normal submandibular gland. Phenylephrine dramatically enhanced the expression of SIRT1, which was significantly reduced by radiation. Furthermore, phenylephrine induced a marked increase of NAMPT promoter activity., CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the regulatory mechanisms of NAMPT expression, which help to understand the mechanism of the cytoprotective role of phenylephrine on irradiated tissues.

1028,"Radiation-dose response of glycophorin A somatic mutation in erythrocytes associated with gene polymorphisms of p53 binding protein 1 Information on individual variations in response to ionizing radiation is still quite limited. Previous studies of atomic-bomb survivors revealed that somatic mutations at the glycophorin A (GPA) gene locus in erythrocytes were significantly elevated with radiation exposure dose, and that the dose response was significantly higher in survivors with subsequent cancer development compared to those without cancer development. Noteworthy in these studies were great inter-individual differences in GPA mutant fraction even in persons with similar radiation doses. It is hypothesized that persistent GPA mutations in erythrocytes of atomic-bomb survivors are derived from those in long-lived hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations, and that individual genetic backgrounds, specifically related to DNA double-strand break repair, contribute to individual differences in HSC mutability following radiation exposure. Thus, we examined the relationship between radiation exposure, GPA mutant fraction in erythrocytes, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the key gene involved in DNA double-strand break repair, p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1). 53BP1 SNPs and inferred haplotypes demonstrated a significant interaction with radiation dose, suggesting that radiation-dose response of GPA somatic mutation is partly dependent on 53BP1 genotype. It is also possible that 53BP1 plays a significant role in DNA double-strand break repair in HSCs following radiation exposure. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.9709508
100,"Dose-response relationships for radium-induced bone sarcomas The incidence of bone sarcomas among 3055 female radium-dial workers who entered the dial industry before 1950 was used to determine dose-response relationships for the induction of bone sarcomas by radium. Two subpopulations were analyzed: all measured cases who survived at least 5 yr after the start of employment and all cases who survived at least 2 yr after first measurement. The first constituted a group based on year of entry; it contained 1468 women who experienced 42 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.4. The second comprised a group based on first measurement; it contained 1257 women who experienced 13 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.2. The dose-response function, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD, and simplifications of this general form, were fit to each data set. Incidence (I) was in units of bone sarcomas per person-yr; (D) was the quantity (muCi) of radium that entered the blood. Two functions, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD and I = (C + beta D2)e-gammaD, fit the data for year of entry (p greater than or equal to 0.05); both these functions and I = (C + alpha D) fit the data for first measurement. The function I = (C + beta D2)e-gammaD was used to predict the number of bone sarcomas in all other pre-1950 radium cases (medical, laboratory and other exposures); fewer were actually observed than the fit of this function to the female dial workers predicted.",Excluded,0.97078407
813,"Monitoring of Tritium Internal Exposure Doses of Heavy-Water Reactor Workers in Third Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant To analyze the tritium internal exposure dose of workers in the Third Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant over the past 15 years. Urine samples provided by workers are tested directly to analyze the tritium concentrations and estimate internal exposure dose. Since 2004, an average of approximately 1600 workers have been monitored annually, with an average annual monitoring frequency of approximately 11 000. Since 2004, the average annual collective dose of tritium internal exposure was 149.62 person.mSv, accounting for 19.07% of the total annual collective dose. A total of 18 workers' annual individual internal tritium radiation doses exceeded 2 mSv, of which 5 workers' internal tritium radiation doses in a single intake exceeded 2 mSv. The occupational population with the largest total internal tritium radiation doses consists of maintenance personnel, fuel operators, and radiation protection personnel, whose collective doses of internal exposure account for 75.51% of the total collective doses within the plant. Over 15 years of operation, the internal tritium radiation doses of workers in the Third Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant have been strictly controlled within the national regulatory limit and power plant management target, ensuring the health and safety of the workers.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Excluded,0.97039175
874,"Pre-apoptotic response to therapeutic DNA damage involves protein modulation of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3 in acute myeloid leukemia cells BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are characterized by non-mutated TP53, high levels of Hdm2, and frequent mutation of the Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase. The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis., RESULTS: Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis., CONCLUSION: Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients.",Excluded,0.9700209
910,"Dissecting the hematopoietic microenvironment. V: limitations of repair following damage to the hematopoietic support stroma Damage and repair of the hematopoietic microenvironment of the spleen was studied using X-irradiation, anoxic necrosis induced by splenic ligation, or a combination of the two, as the destructive agents. Spleen colony number, size and type, 59Fe uptake, and microscopic study of splenic structure were used as means of assessment. The most severe or least repaired damage was induced by high dose irradiation (4000 r), by 1000 r followed immediately by splenic ligation, and by two successive splenic ligations separated by a 30 day recovery period. It was seen that reduction of CFUs lodgment, as measured by f factor, played a very major role in the lesser number of spleen colonies formed after either kind of damage. Following the several treatments, the numbers of spleen colonies formed, their size and their typing as erythrocytic or granulocytic varied independently of each other, suggesting that these functions of the microenvironment, and the cell types responsible for them, are independent of each other. The exhaustion of regenerative capacity displayed by repeatedly ligated spleens suggested a maximal limit for stromal cell replications commensurate with Hayflick's hypothesis.",Excluded,0.9698924
837,"The role of autophagy regulator LC3B in thyroid cancer cells response to metabolic stress and radiation Decreased expression of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B), a well-characterized regulator of autophagy, has been shown to be associated with metastatic progression in patients with thyroid cancer. We hypothesized that LC3B could play a role in the regulation of thyroid cancer cells response to radiation. Expression of LC3B was examined by real-time PCR and Western blot in FTC133, FTC236 and FTC238 cells. Stable LC3B-deficient cells were created by transfection with lentiviral particles containing LC3B specific shRNA. Thyroid cancer cell viability, proliferation, migration and apoptosis were analyzed in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells after exposure to gamma-radiation (6 Gy). Immunostaining with anti-LC3B was performed on tissue samples from 10 patients with anaplastic (ATCs) and 10 patients with papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs). LC3B expression was decreased in cell lines that derived from metastatic lesions (by 70% in FTC236 and by 90% in FTC238) as compared to FTC133 cells. Transfection with lentiviral particles inhibited LC3B mRNA level by 80% in FTC133 cells. LC3B silencing had no effect on cell cycle, did not inhibit thyroid cancer cells migration, and did not induce apoptosis. Glucose deprivation led to phosphorylation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells. Induction of LC3BII and loss of p62 protein were detected in LC3B-expressing but not in LC3B-deficient cells. gamma-radiation induced gH2AX and caspase 3 cleavage in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells. However, recovery of thyroid cancer cells after irradiation was more efficient in LC3B-deficient cells. Colony forming assay showed that survival fraction after gamma-radiation was higher in LC3B-deficient cells compared to LC3B-expressing cells (p = 0.01). Granular cytoplasmic staining with anti-LC3B was detected in 5/10 (50%) differentiated PTCs, but in 0/10 (0%) ATCs. LC3B is involved in thyroid cancer cell resistance to metabolic and oxidative stressors. Decreased LC3B expression in undifferentiated thyroid cancer suggests that defective autophagy can contribute to thyroid cancer cell resistance to therapy.",Excluded,0.9698214
688,"Induction of micronuclei in human sperm-hamster egg hybrids at the two-cell stage after in vitro gamma-irradiation of human spermatozoa The efficiency of the micronucleus test to assess radiation-induced chromosomal damage in human spermatozoa has been investigated. Micronuclei were scored in human sperm-hamster egg hybrids at the two-cell stage, after exposure of human spermatozoa to in vitro gamma-rays at doses of 0.00, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, and 4.00 Gy. The relationship between the yield of micronuclei per two-cell stage as well as the percentage of two-cell stages with micronuclei and the different doses of irradiation were fitted to linear equations. To evaluate whether scoring micronuclei is useful for the quantification of chromosomal damage occurring in human spermatozoa, induced micronuclei at the different doses of sperm irradiation were compared to the induction of breaks and fragments in sperm-derived chromosomes. After interspecific fertilization of zona-free hamster oocytes by irradiated spermatozoa, a total of 699 fertilized eggs at the two-cell stage and a total of 387 sperm-derived complements were analyzed. The incidence of fertilized eggs with micronuclei at the two-cell stage coincided well with the incidence of sperm-derived chromosome breaks and fragments (e.g., 8.9% vs. 6.7% in the 0.25 Gy group and 52.8% vs. 58.6% in the 4.00 Gy group). A similar correlation was found between the number of micronuclei per two-cell stage and the number of breaks and fragments per sperm complement (0.09 vs. 0.07 in the 0.25 Gy group and 0.71 vs. 0.81 in the 4.00 Gy group). The results show that this test system can be used for the quantification of spontaneous or induced chromosomal damage in human spermatozoa.",Excluded,0.9697337
613,"Inter-laboratory comparison of cytogenetic endpoints for the biomonitoring of radiological workers Purpose: The evaluation of different cytogenetic endpoints of radiation damage for the biomonitoring of contract workers temporarily employed at nuclear power plants. Material(s) and Method(s): Blood samples from six donors were irradiated in vitro with doses ranging from 0.1 to 2 Gy 60Co gamma-rays. Compared were a conventional analysis for dicentrics, the conventional micronucleus (MN) assay, the centromere micronucleus assay using p82H and an alphaAllCen pancentromeric probe, and tricolour FISH with chromosome 2, 4 and 8 DNA probes for the scoring of translocations. Result(s): Agreement in the number of MN between Giemsa-and propidium iodine fluorescence-stained preparations was obtained. The control samples showed higher centromere positivity for the MN after FISH with the p82H probe compared with the alphaAllCen probe. The MN results with both probes showed a slight but systematic increase in the number of centromere-positive MN with dose, indicating that radiation, although principally clastogenic, also has aneuploidogenic properties. The values of the genomic translocation frequency (F(G)) derived from the observed translocation frequencies were systematically higher than the dicentric yields. Comparing the sensitivity of the different methods with restriction of the scoring time to 1 day for biomonitoring purposes, the centromere micronucleus assay had the lowest dose detection limit (0.1 to 0.2 Gy). Conclusion(s): This study shows that at present only the centromere micronucleus assay can combine high sensitivity with a reasonable scoring time for the biomonitoring of relatively large populations.",Excluded,0.9696173

The immunogenicity of irradiated blood parasites for intact cattle and splenectomised calves Intraerythrocytic forms of B. bovis were exposed to 350 Grays (Gy) gamma irradiation and were then injected intravenously into intact two and three year old Hereford steers. One of 15 steers died on initial infection and subsequently six steers were given a virulent heterologous challenge three weeks after recovery; all six animals were highly immune. The remaining eight animals were kept under quarantine conditions for 10 months and were then challenged with a different virulent heterologous strain of B. bovis. Seven of eight were highly immune, but one animal died. Subsequently a further 12 steers were injected intravenously with 1 X 10(8) irradiated organisms. All showed only mild transient clinical signs. After 12 months quarantine in a tick-free area these animals were then challenged with a virulent heterologous strain and all 12 were shown to be highly immune. Irradiation reduced the infective dose from 1 X 10(8) to 2.5 X 10(3) parasites. These parasites multiplied at the same rate, and achieved the same maximum parasitaemia as the parent non-irradiated strain, but the disease produced by them was not severe. A dose of 2.5 X 10(3) non-irradiated parasites was lethal to all of the four animals which received it. It was concluded that irradiation had produced a predominantly avirulent parasite population.",Excluded,0.9695972
612,"Biological dosimetry using the micronucleus assay for lymphocytes: interindividual differences in dose response The dose response of the number of micronuclei in cytokinesis-blocked lymphocytes after in-vitro irradiation of whole blood with x rays in the dose range 0-4 Gy was studied for a heterogeneous population of 10 donors. One thousand binucleated cells were systematically scored for micronuclei. A linear-quadratic dose dependency of the micronucleus yields was observed. The data were used to derive the accuracy of the dose assessment with the technique in case of a radiation accident. It was shown that for doses of 2 Gy and higher, the uncertainty of the dose was predominantly due to interindividual differences in the x-ray-induced micronucleus yields. At the 95% confidence level, doses lower than 0.3 Gy could not be unequivocally detected with the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay due to the variability of the baseline micronucleus frequency within the donor population and the poor statistical accuracy when scoring 1,000 cells. The precision and sensitivity of the method in the low-dose range could be improved by the knowledge of individual pre-irradiation baseline values and an increase of the number of cells scored by automation of the technique.",Excluded,0.96953624

806,"Hormonal suppression restores fertility in irradiated mice from both endogenous and donor-derived stem spermatogonia Irradiation interrupts spermatogenesis and causes prolonged sterility in male mammals. Hormonal suppression treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues has restored spermatogenesis in irradiated rats, but similar attempts were unsuccessful in irradiated mice, monkeys, and humans. In this study, we tested a stronger hormonal suppression regimen (the GnRH antagonist, acyline, and plus flutamide) for efficacy both in restoring endogenous spermatogenesis and in enhancing colonization of transplanted stem spermatogonia in mouse testes irradiated with a total doses between 10.5 and 13.5 Gy. A 4-week hormonal suppression treatment, given immediately after irradiation, increased endogenous spermatogenic recovery 1.5-fold, and 11-week hormonal suppression produced twofold increases compared with sham-treated irradiated controls. Furthermore, 10-week hormonal suppression restored fertility from endogenous surviving spermatogonial stem cells in 90% of 10.5-Gy irradiated mice, whereas only 10% were fertile without hormonal suppression. Four-and 11-week hormonal suppression also enhanced spermatogenic development from transplanted stem spermatogonia in irradiated recipient mice, by 3.1-and 4.8-fold, respectively, compared with those not given hormonal treatment. Moreover, the 10-week hormonal suppression regimen, but not a sham treatment, restored fertility of some 13.5-Gy irradiated recipient mice from donor-derived spermatogonial stem cells. This is the first report of hormonal suppression inducing recovery of endogenous spermatogenesis and fertility in a mouse model treated with anticancer agents. The combination of spermatogonial transplantation with hormonal suppression should be investigated as a treatment to restore fertility in young men after cytotoxic cancer therapy. © The Author 2010.

The plating efficiency for 11 of the 14 melanomas studied was sufficiently high (PE = 0.3-58%) to measure cell survival over at least two decades. Experiments repeated with cells stored in liquid nitrogen showed that the survival assay gave highly reproducible results. The melanomas exhibited individual and characteristic survival curves whether exposed to radiation or heat (43.5 degrees C). The Do-values were in the ranges 0.63-1.66 Gy (X-rays) and 33-58 min (heat). The survival curves were similar to those reported previously for human melanoma xenografts. The radiation sensitivity of the cells was not correlated to the heat sensitivity. Since the melanomas appeared to be very heterogeneous in radiation response in vitro as melanomas are known to be clinically, it is suggested that melanomas may be suitable for prospective studies aimed at establishing whether clinical radioresponsiveness somehow is related to in vitro survival curve parameters.",Excluded,0.96909475

283,"Dose-response relationships for radiation-induced hyperparathyroidism It has been hard to establish with certainty that radiation exposure is a risk factor for developing hyperparathyroidism. In part this is because many cases of hyperparathyroidism remain asymptomatic and escape clinical detection. We present results from a study of 2555 subjects who received external beam radiotherapy to the head and neck area for benign conditions before their 16th birthday between 1939 and 1962. The average length of follow-up was 36.6 yr. There were 36 confirmed cases of hyperparathyroidism. Based on a relative risk model, the excess relative risk increased significantly by 0.11/centigray; however, the confidence interval was wide (95% confidence interval, 0.0-17.2). The hyperparathyroidism rates and dose-response relationships were not affected by gender or age at first radiation treatment. The demonstration of a dose-response relationship within an irradiated cohort supports an association between radiation exposure and hyperparathyroidism and suggests that the calcium levels of individuals irradiated to the head and neck area should be monitored.",Excluded,0.96820563
737,"Mayak worker dosimetry study: an overview The Mayak Production Association (MPA) was the first plutonium production plant in the former Soviet Union. Workers at the MPA were exposed to relatively large internal radiation intakes and external radiation exposures, particularly in the early years of plant operations. This paper describes the updated dosimetry database, ""Doses-2005."" Doses-2005 represents a significant improvement in the determination of absorbed organ dose from external radiation and plutonium intake for the original cohort of 18,831 Mayak workers. The methods of dose reconstruction of absorbed organ doses from external radiation uses: 1) archive records of measured dose and worker exposure history, 2) measured energy and directional response characteristics of historical Mayak film dosimeters, and 3) calculated dose conversion factors for Mayak Study-defined exposure scenarios using Monte Carlo techniques. The methods of dose reconstruction for plutonium intake uses two revised models developed from empirical data derived from bioassay and autopsy cases and/or updates from prevailing or emerging International Commission on Radiological Protection models. Other sources of potential significant exposure to workers such as medical diagnostic x-rays, ambient onsite external radiation, neutron radiation, intake of airborne effluent, and intake of nuclides other than plutonium were evaluated to determine their impact on the dose estimates.",Excluded,0.9678887

In all cases the observed dicentric yield was significantly higher in comparison with the background level, and the resulting estimated whole body doses lay between 0.2 and 0.3 Gy. Now, a number of years later (1 to 11 years), the frequency of translocations has been determined by means of the FISH technique. Chromosomes 2, 4 and 8 were painted. The measured translocation frequency lay, however, within the range of the spontaneous variation between individuals. No radiation exposure could, therefore, be proven. In two further cases, the dicentrics were determined by means of the conventional Giemsa staining technique, and the translocations by means of chromosome painting carried out on the same blood samples, which were taken about 3 and 10 years, respectively, after the radiation exposure.

796,"Impact of radiotherapy dose on dentition breakdown in head and neck cancer patients Purpose: To evaluate the severity of post-radiation dental lesions and possible correlation with radiation dose to the teeth in patients treated for head and neck cancers. Methods and Materials: Data from 93 head and neck radiotherapy patients treated between 1997 and 2008 were analyzed retrospectively. The main effect, radiation dose to the individual teeth, was evaluated with covariates of elapsed time after radiation, xerostomia, topical fluoride use, and oral hygiene status included. Patients' radiotherapy plans were used to calculate cumulative exposure for each tooth. Patients' teeth were evaluated using a validated index and then categorized as having none-slight or moderate-severe post-radiation damage. Result(s): Patients (31 females, 62 males) ranged in age from 18-82 years (mean 57). The number of teeth-patient ranged from 3-30 (mean 20) with a total of 1873 teeth evaluated. Overall, 51% of teeth had moderate-severe damage, with the remaining having little or none. Using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, the odds for moderate-severe damage were 2-3 times greater for teeth exposed to between 30 and 60 Gy as compared to no radiation. However, for teeth exposed to >= 60 Gy as compared to no radiation the odds of moderate-severe tooth damage was greater by a magnitude of 10 times. Conclusion(s): The results indicate that there is minimal tooth damage below 30 Gy (salivary gland threshold), a greater than 1:1 increased dose-response between 30 and 60 Gy likely related to salivary gland damage, and a critical threshold of >= 60 Gy, which may be linked to direct effects of radiation on tooth structure.

Experimental Design: Adult mice were infused with Alda-89 or vehicle before, during, and after radiotherapy. Saliva secretion was monitored weekly. Hematology, metabolic profile, and postmortem evaluation for toxicity were examined at the time of sacrifice. Alda-89 or vehicle was applied toHNCcell lines in vitro, and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice transplanted with HNC in vivo with or without radiation; HNC growth was monitored. The ALDH3A1 and ALDH3A2 protein expression was evaluated in 89 patients with HNC and correlated to freedom from relapse (FFR) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Alda-89 infusion significantly resulted in more whole saliva production and a higher percentage of preserved acini after radiotherapy compared with vehicle control. There was no difference in the complete blood count, metabolic profile, and major organ morphology between the Alda-89 and vehicle groups. Compared with vehicle control, Alda-89 treatment neither accelerated HNC cell proliferation in vitro, nor did it affect tumor growth in vivo with or without radiotherapy. Higher expression of ALDH3A1 orALDH3A2 was not significantly associated with worse FFR or OS in either human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive or HPV-negative group. Conclusion(s): Alda-89 preserves salivary function after radiotherapy without affecting HNC growth or causing measurable toxicity in mice.

The proliferation and differentiation status of the irradiated epidermis was characterized with specific markers using immunohistochemical methods., RESULTS: All samples presented with hyperplasia of the epidermis associated with local inflammation. The scar epidermis exhibited an increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which revealed hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Furthermore, an abnormal differentiation was found, characterized by the expression of K6 and K16, and by alterations in protein amounts and localization of cytokeratins, involucrin, and transforming growth factor-beta1., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that late damage of irradiated skin is not only characterized by fibrosis in the dermis but also by hyperplasia in the epidermis.

Outcomes with conventional fractionation (2-2.4 Gy per fraction; n = 27) were compared to hypofractionation (4-6 Gy per fraction; n = 36). The primary endpoint was local control and the secondary endpoint was toxicity., RESULTS: Comparable local control rates were found after 2 and 5 years (63% vs 64% and 47% vs 53%; P = .73 for, respectively, conventional fractionation vs hypofractionation). Local recurrences were predominantly present ipsilateral (92%) and within the irradiated volume (88%). Late toxicity grade >= 3 was observed in 2 of 63 patients, 1 patient in both groups., CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy fractionation schedule did not influence the local control rate or the incidence of late toxicity in patients treated with surgery and RT for sinonasal malignant melanoma in this retrospective analysis. Due to this retrospective nature and the limited number of patients, strong recommendations cannot be made. Expected toxicity, patient convenience, and workload may be taken into account for the choice of fractionation schedule until conclusive evidence becomes available.

In the present study, the absorbed dose and the background radiation level are determined using the electron spin resonance (ESR) method on tooth samples. The effect of using different tooth surfaces and teeth exposed with single medical X-rays on the absorbed dose are also evaluated. A total of 48 molars of position 6-8 were collected from 13 district hospitals in Peninsular Malaysia. Thirty-six teeth had not been exposed to any excessive radiation, and 12 teeth had been directly exposed to a single X-ray dose during medical treatment prior to extraction. There was no significant effect of tooth surfaces and exposure with single X-rays on the measured absorbed dose of an individual. The mean measured absorbed dose of the population is 34 +/- 6.2 mGy, with an average tooth enamel age of 39 years. From the slope of a regression line, the estimated annual background dose for Peninsular Malaysia is 0.6 +/- 0.3 mGy y(-1).

349,"A Small Peptide Ac-SDKP Inhibits Radiation-Induced Cardiomyopathy BACKGROUND: Advances in radiotherapy for thoracic cancers have resulted in improvement of survival. However, radiation exposure to the heart can induce cardiotoxicity. No therapy is currently available to inhibit these untoward effects. We examined whether a small tetrapeptide, N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (Ac-SDKP), can counteract radiation-induced cardiotoxicity by inhibiting macrophage-dependent inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. METHODS AND RESULTS: After characterizing a rat model of cardiac irradiation with magnetic resonance imaging protocols, we examined the effects of Ac-SDKP in radiation-induced cardiomyopathy. We treated rats with Ac-SDKP for 18 weeks. We then compared myocardial contractile function and extracellular matrix by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and the extent of inflammation, fibrosis, and Mac-2 (galectin-3) release by tissue analyses. Because Mac-2 is a crucial macrophage-derived mediator of fibrosis, we performed studies to determine Mac-2 synthesis by macrophages in response to radiation, and change in profibrotic responses by Mac-2 gene depleted cardiac fibroblasts after radiation. Cardiac irradiation diminished myocardial contractile velocities and enhanced extracellular matrix deposition. This was accompanied by macrophage infiltration, fibrosis, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and cardiac Mac-2 expression. Ac-SDKP strongly inhibited these detrimental effects. Ac-SDKP migrated into the perinuclear cytoplasm of the macrophages and inhibited radiation-induced Mac-2 release. Cardiac fibroblasts lacking the Mac-2 gene showed reduced transforming growth factor beta1, collagen I, and collagen III expression after radiation exposure. CONCLUSION(S): Our study identifies novel cardioprotective effects of Ac-SDKP in a model of cardiac irradiation. These protective effects are exerted by inhibiting inflammation, fibrosis, and reducing macrophage activation.

The majority of study subjects were under 50-year-old and male workers. The average annual effective dose of radiation declined both men (from 2.75 to 1.43 mSv) and women (from 1.34 to 0.95 mSv) over the period of 1996-2011. A total of 99 cancers (66 cancers in men and 33 in women) were reported from 1992 to 2010. The standardized incidence ratio of all cancer combined was significantly lower in men (SIR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96) than general population, but the ratios for thyroid cancer were significantly higher than expected among both men and women., CONCLUSIONS: This cohort provides comprehensive information on work activities and health status of diagnostic radiologic technologists. In addition, the nationwide representative sample provides unique opportunities compared with previous radiologic technologist studies.",Excluded,0.96256626
334,"Loss of Egr1, a human del5q gene, accelerates BCR-ABL driven chronic myelogenous leukemia There is substantial evidence that early growth response-1 (Egr1) gene, a zincfinger transcription factor, behaves as a tumor suppressor in leukemia. This includes reports from this laboratory that constitutive Egr1 overrides leukemia conferred by deregulated c-Myc or E2F-1 in the M1 myeloid leukemic cell line by promoting differentiation. To investigate the effect of Egr1 on the initiation and progression of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), lethally irradiated syngeneic wild type mice were reconstituted with bone marrow (BM) from either wild type or Egr1 null mice transduced with a 210-kD BCR-ABL-expressing MSCV-retrovirus (bone marrow transplantation (BMT)). Loss of Egr1 was observed to accelerate the development of BCR-ABL driven leukemia in recipient mice, resulting in the development of a more aggressive disease, a significantly shortened median survival time, and increased BCR-ABL expressing leukemic stem/progenitor cells (GFP+Lin-cKit+Sca+). Egr1 deficient progenitors expressing BCR-ABL exhibited decreased apoptosis, and increased cell viability and proliferation relative to WT counterparts. Secondary BMT of BCR-ABL BM revealed that loss of Egr1 resulted in enrichment of LSCs, consistent with shorter survival time and more aggressive disease of these mice compared to WT counterparts. Furthermore, serial re-plating colony assays indicated that loss of Egr1 increased self-renewal ability of BCR-ABL expressing BM. These novel findings on the tumor suppressor role of Egr1 in CML provide the impetus to study the effect of altering Egr1 expression in AML, where the overall five year survival rate remains low. The effect of loss of Egr1 in CML could reflect its established functions in normal hematopoiesis, maintaining quiescence of HSCs and driving terminal differentiation to the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Gain of function studies should validate these conclusions and provide further rationale for increased Egr1 as a therapeutic target in AML.Copyright © Maifrede et al.",Excluded,0.9624299
239,"Reconstitution of bone marrow with WKy cells lowers central/peripheral inflammation and blood pressure in the SHR Introduction: Bone marrow (BM) is a crucial meeting point for the sympathetic innervation and hematopoietic/stem cells, including the inflammatory cells (ICs). However, the role of the BM in hypertension is not well defined. We recently demonstrated that a dysfunctional brain-bone marrow communication in rat models of neurogenic hypertension may be associated with impaired BM activity, characterized by elevated levels of ICs in the blood and BM when compared to the normotensive controls. Therefore, we hypothesized that BM of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is pro-inflammatory, and that it contributes to hypertension in this rat model. Method(s): 6-week old female SHR rats underwent BM ablation via a lethal dose of gamma ray irradiation (950 Rads), followed by reconstitution with whole BM mononuclear cells (MNCs, 10E6 cells per rat), derived from the BM of either SHR or WKY male rats (naive SHR n=7; SHR-SHR n=11; SHR-WKY n=9). Following a three-month recovery period, BM reconstitution was confirMed. by Y-chromosome FISH in blood MNCs. Blood pressure was measured by tail-cuff plethysmography. Blood was collected for isolation of MNCs, and quantification of T-cells (CD4/CD8+) was carried out by flow cytometry. Brains were collected and immunohistochemistry was perforMed. using the microglial specific marker Iba1. Microglial activation was quantified by number of microglia per 40,000um2 in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Result(s): We observed no significant difference in the mean arterial pressures (MAP) between the naive SHR (MAP= 134 +/- 5 mmHg) and the SHR-SHR groups (MAP = 137 +/- 5 mmHg). However, the SHR-WKY group showed an approximate 10% decrease in MAP, to 119 +/- 4 mmHg (p<0.05). This was accompanied by a 30% decrease in the circulating T-cell levels, and a 20% decrease in activated microglial cells in the PVN of the SHR-WKY when compared to the SHR-SHR group (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): These data suggest that the pro-inflammatory properties of the SHR BM contribute to hypertension by increasing both the peripheral and central inflammatory status in the SHR. These observations support the role of the BM in hypertension, especially in affecting the inflammatory status, which is a hallmark of hypertension in the SHR.",Excluded,0.9616184

Design(s): Retrospective chart review. Setting(s): Academic teaching hospital (referral center). Patient(s): All patients with diagnosed thyroid cancer who had been exposed to radiation before surgical treatment were retrospectively identified from the thyroid cancer database at our institution (1963-2007). One hundred twenty-five patients (95 women and 30 men) were included. Inclusion criteria included surgical treatment for thyroid cancer and a history of exposure to radiation at least 3 years before diagnosis of the disease. Main Outcome Measure(s): Pathologic features and data related to disease recurrence, distant metastasis, and survival. Result(s): Mean (range) age at first exposure to radiation was 19.4 (1-65) years, and mean lag time to diagnosis of disease was 28.7 (3-60) years. Patients were treated surgically with either total or near-total thyroidectomy (83%) or partial or subtotal thyroidectomy (17%). Pathologic diagnoses included 111 papillary carcinomas (89%). Sixty- three percent of patients had multifocal disease, 12% had lymphovascular tumor invasion, and 26% had direct ex- trathyroid extension of disease. Twenty-five percent of patients had metastases to cervical lymph nodes, and 9% had distant metastases. Sixteen percent of patients experienced local recurrence of disease. At last follow-up, 86% of patients were alive and free of disease, 8% were alive with disease, 4% had died of thyroid cancer, and 2% had died of an unrelated cause. Compared with other patients with thyroid cancer, this radiation-exposed cohort was more likely to undergo total thyroidectomy, multiple operative procedures, and external radiotherapy. A higher percentage had multifocal disease, extrathyroid extension, stage IV disease, and distant metastases. At follow-up, fewer patients were free of disease, and more patients had died of thyroid disease. Conclusion(s): Patients who have been exposed to radiation have more aggressive disease and worse clinical outcome than other patients with thyroid cancer. © 2009 American Medical Association.

267,"The secondary sex ratio in Italy over the past eighty years (1940 to 2019) and potential impact of radiological contamination after atmospheric nuclear testing and after Chernobyl: Temporal change-point analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo In Europe, the male to female ratio at birth (secondary sex ratio: SSR; sex odds: SO) is 1.04-1.06, is influenced by many factors and is declining in industrialized countries. This study was carried out to identify possible impacts of fallout by atomic bomb tests or by the Chernobyl event on SSR in Italy. Italy is a country without commercial nuclear power generation for the last four decades and thus nearly free of radiological confounders. Counts of annual male and female live births in Italy are provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by the Italian Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT). This study included 57.7 million live births (1940-2019) with overall SSR 1.05829. The Italian SSR trend was modelled with linear and non-linear logistic regression. Trend changes, i.e., periods with level shifts were estimated with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Two distinct idealized level shifts were identified superimposed on a uniform secular downward trend. The first one is seen towards the end of the 1960s with a jump sex odds ratio (SOR) 1.00681, p < 0.0001. The second one occurred in 1987 with SOR 1.00474, p < 0.0001. In each of the 3 periods separated by the two jumps, SSR uniformly decreased with trend SOR per 100 years of 0.98549, p < 0.0001. In conclusion, the secular trend in the Italian SSR showed two marked level shifts, at the end of the 1960s and from 1987 onward. These follow the release of radioactivity by atmospheric atomic bomb tests during the 1960s and by Chernobyl in 1986 and corroborate the hypothesis that ionizing radiation increases SSR.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.96000564

The case series consisted of 28 people who had died of lung cancer in the years 1976-96 and 36 controls chosen randomly from the residents in 1976, matched by sex and year of birth. Individual residential radon concentrations were measured for 1 year with alpha track detectors. The average radon concentration was 46 Bq/m3 for cases and 51 Bq/m3 for controls. Compared to the level of 24 or less Bq/m3, the adjusted odds ratios of lung cancer associated with radon levels of 25-49, 50-99 and 100 or more Bq/m3, were 1.13 (95% confidence interval; 0.29-4.40), 1.23 (0.16-9.39) and 0.25 (0.03-2.33), respectively. None of the estimates showed statistical significance, due to small sample size.

437,"Comparative toxicity of synchrotron and conventional radiation therapy based on total and partial body irradiation in a murine model Synchrotron radiation can facilitate novel radiation therapy modalities such as microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) and high dose-rate synchrotron broad-beam radiation therapy (SBBR). Both of these modalities have unique physical properties that could be exploited for an improved therapeutic effect. While pre-clinical studies report promising normal tissue sparing phenomena, systematic toxicity data are still required. Our objective was to characterise the toxicity of SBBR and MRT and to calculate equivalent doses of conventional radiation therapy (CRT). A dose-escalation study was performed on C57BLJ/6 mice using total body and partial body irradiations. Dose-response curves and TD50 values were subsequently calculated using PROBIT analysis. For SBBR at dose-rates of 37 to 41 Gy/s, we found no evidence of a normal tissue sparing effect relative to CRT. Our findings also show that the MRT valley dose, rather than the peak dose, best correlates with CRT doses for acute toxicity. Importantly, longer-term weight tracking of irradiated animals revealed more pronounced growth impairment following MRT compared to both SBBR and CRT. Overall, this study provides the first in vivo dose-equivalence data between MRT, SBBR and CRT and presents systematic toxicity data for a range of organs that can be used as a reference point for future pre-clinical work.",Excluded,0.9564623
32,"Cytogenetic assessment of heterogeneous radiation doses in cancer patients treated with fractionated radiotherapy The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vivo dose-response relation of chromosome aberration formation and distribution in a context of localised and fractionated radiotherapy. Cytogenetic analysis was applied to eight patients, all treated for the same tumour localisation; the same localisation was used to prevent the variability usually observed between patients treated with radiotherapy and to allow the corresponding roles of the size of irradiation field and of the dose rate to be studied. The yield of dicentrics, centric rings and fragments was measured in blood samples taken before treatment, during the course of radiotherapy and up to 6 months after. After the first fraction of radiotherapy, we observed that the whole-body dose estimated from the yield of dicentrics and rings was higher (0.35+/-0.2 Gy) than the calculated equivalent whole-body dose (0.07+/-0.04 Gy). By contrast, the partial-body dose derived from the Qdr (quotient of dicentrics and rings) model was estimated to be 2.2+/-0.3 Gy, which agreed quite well with the dose delivered to the tumour (2.1+/-0.1 Gy). We also found a correlation between the yield of induced chromosome aberrations and the target field size (p = 0.014). U-value analysis showed that the distribution of dicentrics and rings was overdispersed, despite the fractionation of the exposure, and a positive correlation between the U-value and the dose rate was observed (p = 0.017). Overall, these results suggest that the proportion of undamaged lymphocytes could increase with the dose rate.",Excluded,0.9561204

Several published prognostic gene expression signatures were evaluated within this set. These consisted of different radiotherapy relevant signatures (i.e. for hypoxia, proliferation and 'stemness'). Signatures were correlated with various endpoints that have been determined in the ten different xenograft models. These include immunohistochemical measures for hypoxia and proliferation, volume doubling time (VDT) and local tumour control after fractionated irradiation or after single dose irradiation under clamp hypoxia., RESULTS: We found several significant correlations between the published gene expression signatures and tumour parameters. Several signatures, like the proliferation and wound signature correlated with BrdU labelling index. Further a 'stemness'-related gene signature showed a strong negative correlation with hypoxic fraction., CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous assessment of immunohistochemistry, in vivo tumour properties and gene expression profiling in a comprehensive set of xenograft models can be used to validate and potentially infer biological information about prognostic gene signatures.",Excluded,0.95565295

In head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, long-term treatment-related complications include radiotherapy (RT)-induced carotid vasculopathy and stroke. The current study investigated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of the carotid wall in long-term HNC survivors treated with RT.Methods. MRI of the carotid arteries was performed within a prospective cohort of 42 HNC patients on average 7 years after RT. Two independent radiologists assessed maximal vessel wall thickness of common and internal carotid arteries. In case of wall thickening (>= 2 mm) the MRI signals as well as length of the thickened segment were assessed.Results. Mean (SD) age of the 42 patients at baseline was 53 (13) years and mean (SD) follow-up time after RT was 6.8 (1.3) years. In total 62% were men and 60% had one or more cerebrovascular risk factors. Mean (SD) dose of RT on the common carotid arteries and internal carotid arteries was 57 Gy (11) and 61 Gy (10), respectively. Wall thickening was observed in 58% of irradiated versus 27% of non-irradiated common carotid arteries and 24% of irradiated versus 6% of non-irradiated internal carotid arteries (p < 0.05). Mean (SD) thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated common carotid arteries was 2.5 (0.9) and 2 (0.7) mm (p = 0.02).

All the patients examined were maintained within 4 weeks on a diet, radioprotective effect of which was realized due to the elevated content of sulfur containing amino acids, antioxidants and complexes. In the patients who lived in the radionuclide-contaminated areas, a moderate activation of lipid peroxidation was detected simultaneously with marked alterations in the humoral component of the immunity system, which involved a considerable increase in the levels of IgG and complements C3 and C4.

Aim of this study was to evaluate whether TRAIL - in a soluble isoleucine zippered form - enhances the cytotoxic effect of irradiation on tumour cells with a blockade in the mitochondrial apoptosis route and/or a dysfunctional p53 pathway. Material(s) and Method(s): The p53 mutant human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia line Jurkat transduced with the Bcl-2 gene was used as model system in vitro and in a subcutaneous transplant setting in immunodeficient mice. Sensitivity to single and combined treatment was read out by apoptosis hallmarks and clonogenic survival in vitro, and by bioluminescence and palpation in vivo. Result(s): Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 did not undergo apoptosis after irradiation, but the combination with TRAIL synergistically induced apoptosis without breaking mitochondrial resistance. TRAIL also reduced clonogenic survival after irradiation. In vivo, radiotherapy or TRAIL alone delayed tumour outgrowth, but combination treatment had the most profound effect.

644,"Chromosomal principle of radiation-induced F1 sterility in Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) A dose-response analysis of chromosomal aberrations was performed in male progeny of gamma-irradiated males in the flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella. For comparison, several female progeny from each dose level were examined. Aberrations were detected on microspread preparations of pachytene nuclei in the electron microscope and classified according to pairing configurations of synaptonemal complexes (SCs). Fragmentation and various translocations were the most numerous aberrations, whereas interstitial deletion and inversion were rare. At 100 Gy, relatively simple multiple translocations were found. Multiple translocations showing complicated configurations occurred at 150 and 200 Gy, and their number increased with the dose. In males, the mean number of chromosomal breaks resulting in aberrations linearly increased with the dose from 8.4 to 16.2 per nucleus. In females, this value achieved a maximum of 11.2 breaks/nucleus at 200 Gy. Three factors were suggested to contribute to the reported higher level of F1 sterility in males than females: (i) survival of males with high numbers of breaks, (ii) crossing-over in spermatogenesis but not in the achiasmatic oogenesis, and (iii) a higher impact of induced changes on the fertility of males than females. It was concluded that translocations are most responsible for the production of unbalanced gametes resulting in sterility of F1 moths. However, F1 sterility predicted according to the observed frequency of aberrations was much higher than the actual sterility reported earlier. This suggests a regulation factor which corrects the predicted unbalanced state towards balanced segregation of translocated chromosomes.",Excluded,0.9301491

Epidemiology provides little help to quantify the risk, because the astronaut group is small and as yet mostly involved in low-Earth orbit mission, whilst the usual cohorts used for radiation protection on Earth (e.g. atomic bomb survivors) were exposed to a radiation quality substantially different from the energetic charged particle field found in space. However, there are over 260,000 patients treated with accelerated protons or heavier ions for different types of cancer, and this cohort may be useful for quantifying the effects of space-like radiation in humans. Space radiation protection and particle therapy research also share the same tools and devices, such as accelerators and detectors, as well as several research topics, from nuclear fragmentation cross sections to the radiobiology of densely ionizing radiation. The transfer of the information from the cancer radiotherapy field to space is manifestly complicated, yet the two field should strengthen their relationship and exchange methods and data.Copyright © 2021",Excluded,0.9250377
626,"[X-ray-induced breaks in the X chromosomes in Drosophila lines of various radiosensitivities] The frequency of X-ray induced X-chromosome breaks has been studied in females of the line rad (2) 201G1 hypersensitive to radiation and in females of the control line selected from the same population. The frequency of X-chromosome breaks was judged based on the frequency of X0 males occurrence. Synergism of the effects of X-rays (at doses 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 kr) and of hyperthermia (+37 degrees C, 5.5 hours) applied after irradiation served as an indirect evidence for the functioning of DNA repair systems. It is demonstrated that radiosensitivity of mature oocytes of the lines compared was equal and that hyperthermia applied after irradiation increased the latter effect in both lines. Young oocytes of the control line were radioresistant, and hyperthermia applied after irradiation enhanced its effect. Opposite to them, young oocytes of the rad line females were radiosensitive. They did not differ from mature oocytes in the frequency of X-chromosome losses. Synergism of the two factors (irradiation and hyperthermia) was not registered in young oocytes. On the basis of the results obtained, it may be concluded that radiosensitivity of young oocytes in the hypersensitive line is conditioned by the failure of DNA repair systems and that the rad (2) 201G1 gene may be considered, in relation to the genes controlling DNA repair, as a suppressor functioning selectively at a certain stage of oogenesis.",Excluded,0.924976
119,"Residential radon and lung cancer in Sweden: risk analysis accounting for random error in the exposure assessment A large epidemiologic study on residential radon exposure and lung cancer has been conducted in Sweden. An attempt is now made to quantify the impact of random error in the exposure assessment on the risk estimate for lung cancer in this study. The study included 1,360 lung cancer cases, diagnosed from 1980 to 1984, and 2,847 population controls. Radon measurements were performed in 8,992 dwellings occupied by the study subjects some time since 1947. Questionnaires provided information on smoking and other risk factors. Imprecision in the retrospective exposure assessment for radon was estimated from a Monte Carlo technique modeling Swedish conditions. Adjusted risk estimates were obtained from regression analyses based on expected values for true time-weighted average residential radon concentration (TWA), conditional on observed TWA. Without adjustment for random error in the TWA estimates, the linear excess relative risk coefficient was 0.10 per 100 Bq m(-3), but an excess relative risk of about 0.15 to 0.20 per 100 Bq m(-3) was suggested following adjustment. The potentially significant consequences of errors in the retrospective radon exposure assessment should be taken into consideration in the risk estimation as well as in comparisons of results of different studies and in future pooled analyses.",Excluded,0.92364395
31,"Vision-targeted health-related quality of life in adult survivors of retinoblastoma IMPORTANCE Retinoblastoma survivors are at risk for adverse oculo-visual outcomes. Limited data are available regarding long-term vision-targeted health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adult retinoblastoma survivors. OBJECTIVE To examine vision-targeted HRQoL as reported on the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Field Questionnaire for overall and specific scale scores among adult survivors of retinoblastoma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Retinoblastoma Survivor Study is a retrospective cohort of adult retinoblastoma survivors treated at 3 academic medical centers in New York between 1932 and 1994. Participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire between April 2008 and June 2010. Items were scored in January 2013 and preliminary analyses were performed in July 2015. Models were finalized in May 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported vision-targeted HRQoL as reported on the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Field Questionnaire. Items are scored from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest quality of life. RESULTS Among 470 adult retinoblastoma survivors (53.6% with bilateral disease; 52.1% female; 86.4% white and non-Hispanic; mean age at study, 43.3 years; range, 18.0-77.0 years), 86% had at least 1 eye removed (1 eye, 74.5%; both eyes, 11.5%); 56.5% were previously treated with radiotherapy; and 61.3% rated their eyesight as excellent/good while 16.2% reported complete blindness. The overall mean (SD) VFQ composite score for all survivors was 81.1 (17.2) (mean [SD] score for unilateral retinoblastoma survivors, 91.4 [7.7]; bilateral retinoblastoma survivors, 72.3 [18.2]; difference between survivors with unilateral and bilateral disease, 19.1 [95% CI, 16.5-21.7; P < .001]). Prior exposure to radiotherapy was not associated with decreased overall VFQ (s = -0.08; 95% CI, -0.15 to 0.002; P = .06) but was related to a few specific subdomains of visual functioning. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest retinoblastoma-related oculo-visual problems are associated with functional status and vision-targeted HRQoL of adult survivors, particularly among those with bilateral disease.Copyright © 2018 American Medical Association.

1127,"Statistical analysis of observational study of the influence of radon and other risk factors on lung cancer incidence An observational study is a type of epidemiological study when the researcher observes the situation but is not able to change the conditions of the experiment. The statistical analysis of the observational study of the population of Lermontov city (North Caucasus) was conducted. In the initial group, there were 121 people with lung cancer diagnosis and 196 people of the control group. Statistical analysis was performed only for men (95 cases and 76 controls). The use of logistic regression with correction on age gives the value of odds ratio 1.95 (0.87/4.37; 90% CI) per 100 working levels per month of combined (occupational and domestic) radon exposure. It was demonstrated that chronic lung diseases are an additional risk factor for uranium miners but it is not a significant risk factor for general population. Thus, the possibility of obtaining statistically reliable results in the observational studies when using the correct methods of analysis is demonstrated.Copyright © The Author 2014.

426,"Phosphorylation of Ser312 contributes to tumor suppression by p53 in vivo The tumor suppressor p53 is a master sensor of stress, and posttranslational modifications are key in controlling its stability and transcriptional activities. p53 can be phosphorylated on at least 23 Ser/Thr residues, the majority of which are phosphorylated by stress-related kinases. An exception is Ser315 in human p53 (Ser312 in mouse), which is predominantly phosphorylated by cell cyclerelated kinases. To understand the biological importance of Ser312 phosphorylation in vivo, wegenerated p53Ser312Ala knock-in mice. We show here that, although Ser312 is not essential for mouse life span under normal physiological conditions, Ser312Ala mutation dampens p53's activity during embryonic development. This is evident from its partial rescue of embryonic lethality caused by Mdm4 deletion. In agreement with the notion that Ser312 mutation weakens p53 function, Ser312Ala mice are alsomore susceptible to tumorigenesis following a sublethal ionizing radiation dose. Importantly, in the cohort studied, Ser312 mutation predisposes mice to develop thymic lymphomas and liver tumors, partly due to p53Ser312Ala's inability to fully induce a set of p53 target genes including p21 and cyclin G1. Thus, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser312 is required for p53 to function fully as a tumor suppressor in vivo.",Excluded,0.91809154

Recently, a relatively nontoxic monophosphoryl Lipid A (LAM) that retains many of the immunobiologic properties of LPS has been isolated from a polysaccharide deficient Re mutant strain of Salmonella minnesota (R595). The ability of the native endotoxic glycolipid (GL) from S. minnesota (R595) as well as diphosphoryl lipid A (LAD) and nontoxic monophosphoryl lipid A (LAM) derived from GL to protect LPS responsive (CD2F1 or C3H/HeN) and nonresponsive (C3H/HeJ) mice from 60Co gamma irradiation has been studied. Administration of GL, LAD, or LAM to CD2F1 or C3H/HeN mice (400 micrograms/kg) 24 h prior to exposure provided significant radioprotection. No protection was afforded to C3H/HeJ mice. Experiments were also conducted to determine the relative abilities of GL, LAD, and LAM to stimulate hematopoiesis as reflected by the endogenous spleen colony (E-CFU) assay. Protection was not correlated with the ability of these substances to increase E-CFUs or to induce colony-stimulating activity (CSA).",Excluded,0.9163421
832,"T95 nucleophosmin phosphorylation as a novel mediator and marker of regulated cell death in acute kidney injury The function of site-specific phosphorylation of nucleophosmin (NPM), an essential Bax chaperone, in stress-induced cell death is unknown. We hypothesized that NPM threonine 95 (T95) phosphorylation both signals and promotes cell death. In resting cells, NPM exclusively resides in the nucleus and T95 is nonphosphorylated. In contrast, phosphorylated T95 NPM (pNPM T95) accumulates in the cytosol after metabolic stress, in multiple human cancer cell lines following gamma-radiation, and in postischemic human kidney tissue. Based on the T95 phosphorylation consensus sequence, we hypothesized that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) regulates cytosolic NPM translocation by phosphorylating T95 NPM. In a cell-free system, GSK-3beta phosphorylated a synthetic NPM peptide containing T95. In vitro, bidirectional manipulation of GSK-3beta activity substantially altered T95 phosphorylation, cytosolic NPM translocation, and cell survival during stress, mechanistically linking these lethal events. Furthermore, GSK-3beta inhibition in vivo decreased cytosolic pNPM T95 accumulation in kidney tissue after experimental ischemia. In patients with acute kidney injury, both cytosolic NPM accumulation in proximal tubule cells and NPM-rich intratubular casts were detected in frozen renal biopsy tissue. These observations show, for the first time, that GSK-3beta promotes cell death partly by phosphorylating NPM at T95, to promote cytosolic NPM accumulation. T95 NPM is also a rational therapeutic target to ameliorate ischemic renal cell injury and may be a universal injury marker in mammalian cells.Copyright © 2020 the American Physiological Society",Excluded,0.91326463

101,"Non-myeloablative busulfan chimeric mouse models are less pro-inflammatory than head-shielded irradiation for studying immune cell interactions in brain tumours Background: Chimeric mouse models generated via adoptive bone marrow transfer are the foundation for immune cell tracking in neuroinflammation. Chimeras that exhibit low chimerism levels, blood-brain barrier disruption and pro-inflammatory effects prior to the progression of the pathological phenotype, make it difficult to distinguish the role of immune cells in neuroinflammatory conditions. Head-shielded irradiation overcomes many of the issues described and replaces the recipient bone marrow system with donor haematopoietic cells expressing a reporter gene or different pan-leukocyte antigen, whilst leaving the blood-brain barrier intact. However, our previous work with full body irradiation suggests that this may generate a pro-inflammatory peripheral environment which could impact on the brain's immune microenvironment. Our aim was to compare non-myeloablative busulfan conditioning against head-shielded irradiation bone marrow chimeras prior to implantation of glioblastoma, a malignant brain tumour with a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Method(s): Recipient wild-type/CD45.1 mice received non-myeloablative busulfan conditioning (25 mg/kg), full intensity head-shielded irradiation, full intensity busulfan conditioning (125 mg/kg) prior to transplant with whole bone marrow from CD45.2 donors and were compared against untransplanted controls. Half the mice from each group were orthotopically implanted with syngeneic GL-261 glioblastoma cells. We assessed peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen chimerism, multi-organ pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles at 12 weeks and brain chimerism and immune cell infiltration by whole brain flow cytometry before and after implantation of glioblastoma at 12 and 14 weeks respectively. Result(s): Both non-myeloablative conditioning and head-shielded irradiation achieve equivalent blood and spleen chimerism of approximately 80%, although bone marrow engraftment is higher in the head-shielded irradiation group and highest in the fully conditioned group. Head-shielded irradiation stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood and spleen but not in the brain, suggesting a systemic response to irradiation, whilst non-myeloablative conditioning showed no cytokine elevation. Non-myeloablative conditioning achieved higher donor chimerism in the brain after glioblastoma implantation than head-shielded irradiation with an altered immune cell profile. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that non-myeloablative conditioning generates a more homeostatic peripheral inflammatory environment than head-shielded irradiation to allow a more consistent evaluation of immune cells in glioblastoma and can be used to investigate the roles of peripheral immune cells and bone marrow-derived subsets in other neurological diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded,0.9062917

None of them had shown mental deterioration before radiotherapy nor tumor recurrence after radiotherapy. Radiation was given at a dose of 48 to 78 Gy (mean: 54.2 Gy). Patients were assigned for mental functional levels according to Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) after radiotherapy. Ten patients (40%) were normal. Seven patients (28%) showed moderate disabilities and 8 (32%) severe disabilities. The median interval time from radiotherapy to the onset of mental deterioration was 2.5 years in the moderate group and 1.6 years in the severe group. CT findings in severe group demonstrated severe brain atrophy and diffuse low density in the white matter after radiotherapy. The risk factors responsible for progressive mental deterioration after radiotherapy may be radiation site and size (whole frontal lobe), total dose (over 60 Gy) and patients age at the time of radiotherapy (over 60 yrs).",Excluded,0.9041388
1065,"Lung cancer and cigarette smoking in Europe: An update of risk estimates and an assessment of inter-country heterogeneity Ten case-control studies have been carried out in 6 European countries to investigate the major risk factors for lung cancer. Carcinogenic effect from cigarette smoke was the most relevant interest in our study, which has included 7,609 cases of lung cancer and 10,431 controls, mainly population based. The results indicate elevated odds ratios (ORs; 23.9 among men and 8.7 among women) with attributable risks exceeding 90% for men and close to 60% for women. A large, and statistically significant, variability of the results across countries was detected after adjusting for the most common confounding variables, and after controlling, at least in part, for the instability of the ORs due to the small number of non-smokers in some of the study subsets. This pattern of lung cancer risk associated with cigarettes smoke, across different European regions, reflects inherent characteristics of the studies as well as differences in smoking habits, particularly calender periods of starting, and it is likely to have been influenced by effect modifiers like indoor radon exposure, occupation, air pollution and dietary habits. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded,0.90406007
547,"Mortality Analysis of the Life Span Study (LSS) Cohort Taking into Account Multiple Causes of Death Indicated in Death Certificates Mortality analyses have been performed using underlying causes of death as reported on death certificates; these are uniquely determined for a deceased person according to the World Health Organization coding system. Comorbidities, the disease conditions other than the underlying cause of death from death certificates recording multiple causes of death, have rarely been explored in Life Span Study subjects. The purpose of this study was to clarify associations between atomic bomb radiation exposure and mortality from combinations of the underlying cause of death and comorbidities. The focused follow-up period was 1977-2003, prior to which death certificate accuracy was unreliable. The study cohort was comprised of 10,017 people for whom the category ""all circulatory disease"" was listed as the underlying cause of death, of which heart disease (rheumatic, hypertensive and ischemic heart disease) and stroke were major subtypes. Comorbidities considered were pneumonia, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer and the major circulatory disease subtypes listed above. Poisson regression models were used for analyses. Excess relative risks (ERRs) for mortality at 1 Gy were significantly increased when cancer was comorbid with all circulatory disease, heart disease, ischemic heart disease or stroke, ranging from 0.61 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.13, 1.41; N = 177 for all circulatory diseases to 1.60 (CI: 0.07, 4.86; N = 42) for ischemic heart disease. Among the other comorbidities, only diabetes comorbid with heart disease had a significant radiation dose response (ERR at 1 Gy of 0.62, CI: 0.10, 1.46; N = 128). It remains uncertain if the high ERRs with comorbid cancers were anomalous due to the small number of cases or some dissimilarity in statistical methodologies, or if this might suggest some pathogenetic basis for increased fatality. For this reason, further investigation is required.Copyright © 2017 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.89361227

An ecological study from an area with high indoor radon concentration (Galicia, Spain) PURPOSE: To analyze the correlation between municipal esophageal cancer relative risk and municipal residential radon concentration in a high radon emission Spanish area., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an ecological study at municipal level in Galicia, Spain. For each municipality we estimated the median radon concentration and the relative risk (RR) for esophageal cancer mortality for males and females. The relative risk was calculated using a Bayesian approach. Homes with data on radon concentration were selected through stratified random sampling. To be included, each municipality had to have at least five radon measurements. We obtained Spearman's correlations for median residential radon concentration and esophageal cancer mortality RR for males and females, separately., RESULTS: We included 129 municipalities, covering the 79% of Galician population. 14% of municipalities had radon concentrations above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) action level. We found a statistically significant correlation among residential radon and esophageal cancer mortality RR for males (p < 0.001), but not for females. When the analysis was restricted to municipalities with more than 15 radon measurements the correlation pattern remained., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study analyzing the association between residential radon and esophageal cancer.

695,"Radiation protection by the Ocimum flavonoids orientin and vicenin: Mechanisms of action In previous studies, flavonoids, orientin and vicenin, that were isolated from the leaf extract of Ocimum sanctum, were found to protect mice against radiation injury. Several flavonoids are known to be good antioxidants. Therefore, the effect of orientin and vicenin on radiation-induced lipid peroxidation in vivo and their antioxidant activity in vitro were studied. Adult mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mug/kg of orientin or vicenin and exposed whole-body to 3 Gy of gamma radiation. Lipid peroxidation was measured in the liver 15 min to 8 h postirradiation. The antioxidant activity of orientin/vicenin (10-500 muM) was studied by measuring inhibition of hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction (Fe3+-EDTA-ascorbic acid-H2O2) in vitro. The compounds were also tested for possible pro-oxidant and iron chelation activities at the above concentrations in the in vitro system. Orientin and vicenin provided almost equal protection against radiation-induced lipid peroxidation in mouse liver. Both compounds showed a significantly greater free radical-inhibiting activity in vitro than DMSO. Neither orientin nor vicenin showed any pro-oxidant activity at the concentrations tested. Both compounds inhibited free radical formation in the absence of EDTA. Free radical scavenging appears to be a likely mechanism of radiation protection by these flavonoids.

Materials and Methods Nine large U.S. medical institutions identified 208 former and current nuclear medicine technologists certified after 1979 and linked these individuals to historic badge dose records maintained by a commercial dosimetry company (Landauer), yielding a total of 2618 annual dose records. The distributions of annual and cumulative occupational doses were described by using summary statistics. Results Between 1992 and 2015, the median annual personal dose equivalent per nuclear medicine technologist was 2.18 mSv (interquartile range [IQR], 1.25-3.47 mSv; mean, 2.69 mSv). Median annual personal dose equivalents remained relatively constant over this period (range, 1.40-3.30 mSv), while maximum values generally increased over time (from 8.00 mSv in 1992 to 13.9 mSv in 2015). The median cumulative personal dose equivalent was 32.9 mSv (IQR, 18.1-65.5 mSv; mean, 51.4 mSv) for 45 technologists who had complete information and remained employed through 2015. Conclusion Occupational radiation doses were well below the established occupational limits and were consistent with those observed for nuclear medicine technologists worldwide and were greater than those observed for nuclear and general medical workers in the United States These results should be informative for radiation monitoring and safety efforts in nuclear medicine departments. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",Excluded,0.8883543
858,"Host and tumor immunity: Local and systemic opportunities to enhance tumor curability by radiotherapy Success of radiation treatment depends on intrinsic properties of tumor cells, involvement of the host immune system and the crosstalk between tumor and host cells in primary and secondary (metastatic) sites. During the last decade our laboratory has investigated the role of these interactions in the ability of radiotherapy to eradicate primary tumors and metastatic disease. In the current presentation we will focus on host factors which interact with ionizing radiation (IR). The results of our studies using genetic models and specific immunological probes have identified CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, professional antigen presenting cells (CD11c+ dendritic cells), local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and host Type I Interferons (IFNs) as required for successful treatment by radiation 1,2. Transformation of the tumor microenvironment into an ""immunological hub"" to suppress local and distant disease is a tantalizing goal for which radiotherapy might be well suited, especially in combination with immunotherapy. , Our group has recently demonstrated that the combination of radiotherapy and anti-PD-L1 antibodies decrease accumulation and function of myeloid derived suppressor cells(CD11b,Gr1+) through enhanced local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs). in experimental systems3,4 The capacity of local radiotherapy to augment the activation TILs and drive cytokine production is, in part, due to the ability to increase tumor antigen cross-presentation by professional antigen presenting cells in the tumor stroma. Our group demonstrated host type I IFNs are essential for enhanced tumor antigen cross-presentation following radiotherapy. The critical role of type I IFNs in the host immune response to radiotherapy positions them as central components in the crosstalk between tumor cells and the host that can exert positive or negative influences depending on the context. In particular, the interaction of tumor cells with the host leads to the selection of clones resistant to the cytotoxic effects of IFNs and radiotherapy. Using transcriptomic approaches we identified a set of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) associated with tumor radioresistance.5 This gene set was identified in different types of primary tumors (lung, prostate, breast and glioblastoma) and termed the Interferon Related DNA Damage Signature (IRDS). Statistical training of this gene set detected a 7 gene signature which predicted response to adjuvant radio/chemotherapy for some woman with breast cancer 6. The IRDS is prognostic for patients with subsets of glioma and prostate cancer. We propose that these data indicate the presence of pro-survival genes in the IFN/Jak/Stat axis, which has been confirmed recently through a genomics approach The Jak-Stat pathway is currently under investigation as a potential therapeutic target for radio-chemosensitization in different tumor types. Our current approaches are directed towards identification of tumor ISGs with pro-survival/radioprotective functions.

Furthermore, Cardioxane alone induced a small but significant increase of TBA-RS in serum and heart tissue, providing additional toxicity.",Excluded,0.851529
200,"Prospective assessment of gustatory function after radiotherapy for head and neck cancers Background: Taste disorders are major causes of morbidity in patients undergoing head and neck irradiation. We quantitatively assessed the gustatory function of patients with head and neck cancers who underwent radiotherapy using recently developed standardised tools for measuring taste. Method(s): Twenty patients undergoing head and neck irradiation responded to a specific questionnaire and were assessed by olfactory and gustatory function tests. To assess changes over time, testing was performed before, immediately after, and at 2- and 4-week intervals following the start of radiotherapy. Concurrently, patients were evaluated for xerostomia from radiotherapy. Result(s): A decrease in the taste recognition threshold was observed in the second week after the beginning of radiotherapy. The taste detection threshold improved within the 14th-18th week. Most affected patients demonstrated that their gustatory function primarily decreased independent of the olfactory function. Disturbances in taste were exponentially worsened beyond an accumulated dose of 30 Gy and involved all tastants. According to a multivariate analysis, radiation-induced taste impairment was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia. However, there was an association between the dose of irradiation and the severity of taste disturbance. Conclusion(s): In this preliminary study, we found that the taste function was worse 2 weeks after the start of radiotherapy and returned to pretreatment levels within 4.5 months. Taste disturbances were exponentially worse beyond an accumulated dose of 20 Gy. Taste dysfunction after radiotherapy was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia, whereas only the dose of irradiation was associated with the severity of taste dysfunction.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded,0.8461145

228,"Detrimental effects of electron beam irradiation on the cowpea bruchid Callosobruchus maculatus BACKGROUND: Electron beam (eBeam) irradiation technology is an environmentally friendly, chemical-free alternative for disinfesting insect pests of stored grains. The underlying hypothesis is that specific doses of eBeam will have defined detrimental effects on the different life stages. We evaluated the effects of eBeam exposure in a range of doses (0.03-0.12 kGy) on the development of the cowpea bruchid (Callosobruchus maculatus) at various stages of its life cycle., RESULTS: Differential radiosensitivity was detected during egg development. Early and intermediate stages of eggs never hatched after exposure to a dose of 0.03 kGy, whereas a substantial portion of black-headed (i.e. late) eggs survived irradiation even at 0.12 kGy. However, further development of the hatched larvae was inhibited. Although midgut protein digestion remained intact, irradiated larvae (0.06 kGy or higher) failed to develop into normal living adults; rather, they died as pupae or abnormally eclosed adults, suggesting a detrimental effect of eBeam on metamorphosis. Emerged irradiated pupae had shorter longevity and were unable to produce any eggs at 0.06 kGy or higher. At this dose range, eggs laid by irradiated adults were not viable. eBeam treatment shortened adult longevity in a dose-dependent manner. Reciprocal crosses indicated that females were more sensitive to eBeam exposure than their male counterparts. Dissection of the female reproductive system revealed that eBeam treatment prevented formation of oocytes., CONCLUSION: eBeam irradiation has very defined effects on cowpea bruchid development and reproduction. A dose of 0.06 kGy could successfully impede cowpea burchid population expansion. This information can be exploited for post-harvest insect control of stored grains.

1068,"Irradiation of male mammary gland for the prevention of hormone induced gynecomastia Treatment of carcinoma of the prostate with female sex hormones causes not only impotence but also swollen, painfully mammary glands. The radiobiological response of the mammary glands renders it possible to prevent hormone induced gynecomastia by means of radiotherapy. On this indication, 121 patients treated with female sex hormones between 1961 and 1972 for carcinoma of the prostate were subjected to irradiation of both mammary glands. On 4 successive days, daily doses of 300 r surface dose were administered to each mammary gland, corresponding to a focal dose of 840 r at 3 cm tissue depth. The parameters were: roentgen radiation, 150 kV, 20 mA, 0.5 mm Cu, focus skin distance 40 cm, field size 6 x 6 m. 84 patients could be followed up more than 6 mth after the treatment. In 67 cases (79.8%), development of gynecomastia was completely suppressed, while in 16 cases, a slight degree of gynecomastia had occurred in spite of the irradiation. In one case, the gynecomastia that had already been completely developed at the time of the radiotherapy, had remained uninfluenced apart from a mitigation of the sensation of tension. In 6 of the patients who were free from gynecomastia (8.9%) the hormone treatment had been started prior to the radiotherapy. This proportion was considerably larger among the patients with mild gynecomastia, viz. 75% (12 cases). The lesser effect of the radiotherapy is considered to be correlated with the duration and dosage of the hormone treatment started prior to the radiotherapy, and may also be correlated with the duration of the interval between the end of the hormone treatment and the start of the irradiation.",Excluded,0.8406207
1056,"Ionizing Radiation Exposure in Patients with COVID-19: More than Needed OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the ionizing radiation exposure in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study in which all patients presented with suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 were included. The study was carried out in a university-affiliated private hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Biological radiation dose exposure (cumulative effective dose: CED) was evaluated in millisievert (mSv) units. RESULT(S): A total of 1410 patients were included in the study. Of all study subjects, 804 patients (57%) underwent only one chest computed tomography (CT) procedure. Six hundred and six patients (43%) had two or more chest CT procedures. Median CED was 6.02 (min-max:1.67-16.27) mSv. The number of patients who were exposed to <= 5 mSv were 149 (24.6%), whereas 457 patients (75.4%) were exposed to >5 mSv. CONCLUSION(S): The radiation exposure in COVID-19 patients seems unjustifiably high. Awareness should be increased as to the proper use of chest CT in COVID-19 as per to the society recommendations.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.

467,"Health profiles of 996 melanoma survivors: The M. D. Anderson experience Background: The incidence and survival of melanoma are increasing, but little is known about its long-term health effects in adult survivors. Method(s): A health survey was available from 996 melanoma survivors (577 treated with surgery alone, and 391 with combined treatments). Their medical/physiologic and psychosocial responses were analyzed and compared with those of the survivors from other cancers. Result(s): The melanoma survivors were 44.8 +/- 12.8 years of age at diagnosis (significantly younger than the survivors of other cancers) and 63.7 +/- 12.8 years at survey. Melanoma survivors were less likely to report that cancer had affected their health than survivors of other cancers (15.8% vs. 34.9%). The 577 individuals treated with surgery alone reported arthritis/osteoporosis, cataracts, and heart problems most frequently (less often than survivors of other cancers). The 391 individuals who had undergone combined treatments reported circulation problems and kidney problems generally as often as survivors of other cancers. Health problems were not associated with number of decades since diagnosis but with age at diagnosis, treatment modality, and family relationships. Conclusion(s): We present information from a large cohort of long-term survivors of melanoma. As a group, they were less likely to report that cancer had affected their overall health than survivors of other cancers; a number of disease related and psychosocial factors appear to influence their health profiles. © 2006 Stava et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded,0.8331704
254,"Characteristics of induced mutations in offspring derived from irradiated mouse spermatogonia and mature oocytes The exposure of germ cells to radiation introduces mutations in the genomes of offspring, and a previous whole-genome sequencing study indicated that the irradiation of mouse sperm induces insertions/deletions (indels) and multisite mutations (clustered single nucleotide variants and indels). However, the current knowledge on the mutation spectra is limited, and the effects of radiation exposure on germ cells at stages other than the sperm stage remain unknown. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing experiments to investigate the exposure of spermatogonia and mature oocytes. We compared de novo mutations in a total of 24 F1 mice conceived before and after the irradiation of their parents. The results indicated that radiation exposure, 4 Gy of gamma rays, induced 9.6 indels and 2.5 multisite mutations in spermatogonia and 4.7 indels and 3.1 multisite mutations in mature oocytes in the autosomal regions of each F1 individual. Notably, we found two types of deletions, namely, small deletions (mainly 1~12 nucleotides) in non-repeat sequences, many of which showed microhomology at the breakpoint junction, and single-nucleotide deletions in mononucleotide repeat sequences. The results suggest that these deletions and multisite mutations could be a typical signature of mutations induced by parental irradiation in mammals.",Excluded,0.825141
939,"A mice radiation-induced liver disease model for stereotactic body radiation therapy validated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): Lower radiation tolerance of the whole liver hinders dose escalations of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. This study was conducted to define the exact doses resulting in radiation-induced liver diseases (RILD) and dose constraints for the critical organs at risk (OARs) in mice, which are still undefined in HCC SBRT. Materials/Methods: This study was consisted of 2 phases. In the primary phase, mice treated with helical tomotherapy based SBRT were stratified according to escalating radiation doses to the livers. Pathological differences, signs, such as mouse performance status (MPS), and serum aspartate/ alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT)/albumin levels were observed. Radiation-induced disease severities of OARs were scored using systematic evaluation standards. In the validation phase in human, 13 patients with HCC who had undergone radiation therapy before hepatectomy were enrolled to validate RILD pathological changes in mice study. Result(s): Evaluation criteria of mouse liver radiation therapy relating signs were as follows: MPS >=2.0+/-0.52, AST/ALT >=589.2+/-118.5/137.4+/-15.3 U/L, serum albumin <=16.8+/-2.29 g/L. Preliminary dose constraints of OARs had also been obtained, such as livers: average dose <=26.36+/-1.71 Gy and gastrointestinal tract: maximum dose <=22.63 Gy. Mouse RILD models could be developed when livers were irradiated with the average doses >=31.76+/-1.94 Gy (single fraction). RILD pathological changes in mice had also been validated in HCC patients. Conclusion(s): Mouse RILD models could be developed with SBRT based on the dose constraints for OARs and evaluation criteria of mice liver radiation therapy relating signs, which will favor the study of further approaches of treating HCC with SBRT.",Excluded,0.8088729

TaqMan Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) was used to verify the SNPs of LIG4 and HSPB1 genes. Chi-square criterion was used to compare the differences in demographic characteristics, exposure to risk factors, and SNPs genotypes. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated by logistic regression analysis. All statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS 18.0., RESULTS: A total of 32 (20.0%) lung cancer patients had RP after receiving radiotherapy. Of the 32 cases, 4 cases were of grade 2, 24 cases were of grade 3, and 4 cases were of grade 4. However, our results indicated that the general condition and treatment of all patients had no significant difference with RP risk (P > 0.05). Meanwhile, our results revealed that there was no significant association between the frequencies of LIG4 rs1805388 and HSPB1 rs2868371 genotype distribution and the risk of RP (P > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we demonstrated that the genetic polymorphisms in LIG4 rs1805388 and HSPB1 rs2868371 were not obviously correlated with the risk of RP and RILI of lung cancer.",Excluded,0.8015871
1022,"Alterations in expression and structure of the DNA repair gene XRCC1 The repair-associated gene XRCC1 was previously cloned by complementing the hamster mutant EM9, which has a high rate of spontaneous SCE and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents. In analyzing XRCC1 gene expression, similar levels of steady-state mRNA were found in normal cells, Bloom's syndrome cells with altered SCE, and in squamous carcinoma cells with differential X-ray sensitivity. An EcoRI restriction fragment-length polymorphism previously identified in XRCC1 did not correlate with the repair phenotypes of these cells. The mRNA of XRCC1 decreased to 20-40% after treatment of cells with a DNA damaging agent. XRCC1 also showed tissue specific expression in rats. The mRNA levels were high in testis (7-8 fold), ovary (3-4 fold) and brain (4-5 fold), when compared with those in intestine, liver and spleen (1-2 fold). These data and the high levels of XRCC1 protein detected in testis indicate that XRCC1 may play an important role in DNA processing during meiogenesis and recombination in germ cells.",Excluded,0.7998018
834,"Gut microbial dysbiosis is associated with development and progression of radiation enteritis during pelvic radiotherapy Radiation enteritis (RE) is the most common complication of radiotherapy for pelvic irradiation receivers. Herein we investigated the alterations in gut microbial profiles and their association with enteritis in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. Faecal samples were collected from 18 cervical cancer patients during radiotherapy. Microbiota profiles were characterized based on 16S rRNA sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Epithelial inflammatory response was evaluated using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures. Dysbiosis was observed among patients with RE, which was characterized by significantly reduced alpha-diversity but increased beta-diversity, relative higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria and lower abundance of Bacteroides. Coprococcus was clearly enriched prior to radiotherapy in patients who later developed RE. Metastat analysis further revealed unique grade-related microbial features, such as more abundant Virgibacillus and Alcanivorax in patients with mild enteritis. Additionally, using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures, RE patient-derived microbiota induced epithelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction, enhanced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta expression compared with control microbiota. Taken together, we define the overall picture of gut microbiota in patients with RE. Our results suggest that dysbiosis of gut microbiota may contribute to development and progression of RE. Gut microbiota can offer a set of biomarkers for prediction, disease activity evaluation and treatment selection in RE. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

534,"Cerebral metastases pathology after radiosurgery: a multicenter study BACKGROUND: To the authors' knowledge, comprehensive human pathologic investigations that explore fundamental radiosurgical effects on metastatic brain tumors are sparse in the literature. The objective of this study was to analyze histopathologic findings in a set of clinically recurrent cerebral metastases after patients underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)., METHODS: In a series of 7500 patients who underwent radiosurgery, 2020 patients (27%) harbored cerebral metastases. Eighteen of 2020 patients (0.9%) underwent subsequent craniotomy for tumor removal anywhere from 1 month to 59 months after they received high-dose irradiation. Histologic and immunohistochemical investigations were performed on the surgically resected tissue specimens. These specimens were within the radiosurgical treatment volume of the metastatic tumor., RESULTS: Light microscopy revealed 3 basic categories of histologic responses: acute-type, subacute-type, and chronic-type tissue reactions. A moderate-to-intense inflammatory cell reaction was seen in the tissue responses of well controlled neoplasms (i.e., in patients who had neoplasms that required craniotomy for recurrent disease > 5 months after SRS), whereas the inflammatory reaction was missing or sparse in poorly controlled neoplasms (patients who required craniotomy for recurrent disease < 5 months after SRS). This reaction was seen within the irradiated tumor volume and not in the peritumoral area nor in areas remote from the radiosurgical treatment volume. Immunohistochemical characterization demonstrated the presence of prominent CD68-positive macrophage and CD3-positive T-lymphocyte populations. A progressively severe vasculopathy also was observed with increasing time after radiosurgery., CONCLUSIONS: Although causality has not been established, a brisk inflammatory response and more severe vasculopathy were observed in lesions in which recurrences were more delayed.

It has been observed that operators exposed to same RF fields with occupational exposure limits. Many workers have health complaints, such as elevated body temperatures in the factory. Safe distances or areas for workers should be recommended in these systems. Protective measures could be implemented to minimize these exposures. Further measurements and occupational exposure studies of RF exposed women and men are needed to demonstrate the levels of exposed Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR).

Patients conditioned with TBI without lung shielding received a significantly higher total lung dose compared with the control group (p less than 0.0001). The 3-year leukaemia-free survival for patients receiving TBI without lung shielding is 54 +/- 18% versus 51 +/- 18% for patients receiving TBI with lung shielding (p = ns). There was no significant difference in the probability of leukaemia relapse (22 +/- 18% for TBI without lung shielding versus 24 +/- 18% for control group; p = ns). The probability of interstitial pneumonitis is 15 +/- 14% for TBI without lung shielding and 5 +/- 5% for TBI with lung shielding (p = ns). A higher incidence of lung fungal infection (15 versus 3%) and interstitial pneumonitis (12 versus 3%) has been documented in patients receiving TBI without lung shielding compared with the control group.

524,"Preoperative radiotherapy contributes to induction of proliferative activity of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T-cells in oral squamous cell carcinoma In order to evaluate host immune response to cancer, many methods have been applied. However, in the field of oral squamous cell carcinoma, evaluation of host immune response on the basis of proliferative activity of tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TIL) has not been reported. Therefore, we applied double immunohistochemical staining of proliferation markers Ki-67 and CD8 to surgically resected and paraffin-embedded tissue sections for 35 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma. With this method, there was a significant correlation between the percentage of Ki-67+CD8+TIL and the intra-tumor epithelium infiltration rate of CD8+TIL (P=0.0237). In the process of analysis, we found that the proliferative activity of CD8+TIL tended to correlate (P=0.0859) with clinical N factor (lymph node metastasis), which was previously reported to suppress host immune response. We therefore assumed there was another factor inducing host immune response. The proliferative activity of CD8+TIL was well correlated with preoperative radiotherapy (P=0.0200) while there was no significant correlation between the proliferative activity of CD8+TIL and other clinical factors; age, tumor size, clinical stage, pathological N factor (P=0.5410, 0.7769, 0.1041, and 0.1072, respectively).

Vascular damage and aberrant angiogenesis in the mucosal layer are essential histological features, but changes to the submucosal layer are unclear. Thus, we evaluated the histological characteristics and distribution changes of key angiogenic factors in full-layered human CRP samples. Method(s): Thirty paraffin-embedded CRP and twenty-nine non-CRP tissues were used to evaluate histopathological changes. Immunohistochemistry with anti-CD34 antibody was performed to calculate microvascular density (MVD). Frozen tissues from eight CRP patients and five non-CRP controls were collected and analyzed by antibody array, which contained sixty human angiogenesis-related factors. Quality controls with positive and negative controls were performed during antibody array analysis. Two differentially expressed factors were confirmed by ELISA. Result(s): CRP lesions showed vasculopathy, fibrosis, mucosal ulceration, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Human angiogenesis antibody array and ELISA confirmed the increased angiostatin in CRP lesions. Immunohistochemical staining showed dispersed distribution of angiostatin throughout the mucosal and submucosal layers in CRP lesions, while angiostatin accumulated within the vessel lumens in non-CRP tissues. MVD significantly decreased in the submucosal layer of CRP, suggesting a potential association with increased angiostatin. Conclusion(s): Angiostatin increased and had a distinct distribution in CRP lesions. Compensatory telangiectasia in the mucosa, vessel stenosis, and reduced MVD might attenuate blood flow in the submucosa and contribute to CRP progression. Restoration of vascular functionality by promoting angiogenesis in the submucosal layer may help alleviate CRP in clinical practice.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded,0.763259

To evaluate the outcomes after treating patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT) without elective nodal irradiation and to evaluate the effects of hypofractionated IFRT. Methods. From December 2004 to November 2015, 51 patients with advanced NSCLC underwent IFRT. Of these, 45 patients were enrolled and evaluated. The median age was 69 years (range, 50-89 years), and 42 patients were men and women. Eleven patients (24.4%) presented with adeno-carcinoma, 30 (66.7%) with squamous cell carcinoma, and (8.9%) with other types. Twenty-four (53.3%) had stage IIIA and 21 (46.7%) had stage IIIB. In patients treated by conventional IFRT, normal fractionation was used (2 Gy/fraction), and the total prescribed dose ranged from 60 to 66 Gy. In patients treated by hypofractionated IFRT, 2.5 Gy/fraction was used, and the total prescribed dose ranged from 65 to 70 Gy. Results. The 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 78.4% and 53.7% , respectively. The 1- and 2-year local control rates were 72.2% and 57.7% , respectively. The patients in the conventional IFRT group had a 1-year local control rate of 61.2% and a 2-year local control rate of 47.6%, while the patients in the hypofractionated IFRT group achieved higher local control rates of 87.1% and 72.5%, respectively (P = 0.0465) Conclusions. IFRT for patients with stage III NSCLC is feasible, and the incidence of elective nodal failure was low.

Captive breeding programs have generated data on the breeding behavior and ecology of G radiata; however, hematologic and biochemical data also are critically important in managing populations. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this study was to evaluate sex and seasonal effects on hematologic and biochemical data from captive radiated tortoises. METHOD(S): Whole blood was collected in January and August 2001 from 18 radiated tortoises (10 male, 8 female) housed at the Wildlife Survival Center on St Catherines Island, Georgia, as part of a routine health assessment. Routine hematologic and plasma biochemical analyses and electrophoresis were done using standard methods. Data from male and female tortoises were compared within and between seasons using 2-way ANOVA. RESULT(S): RBC and HCT values were significantly higher in summer than in winter and were higher in males than in females. Total protein concentration did not differ significantly between males and females; however, female tortoises had significantly higher concentrations of alpha1- and beta-globulins in winter and summer compared to males. Male tortoises had significantly higher sodium and uric acid concentrations and LDH activity during winter, and higher urea concentration and LDH and CK activities in summer, compared with females. Female tortoises had significantly higher triglyceride and phosphorus concentrations in winter, and higher phosphorus, cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations in summer, compared with males. CONCLUSION(S): Sex and seasonal differences in hematologic and biochemical values for radiated tortoises likely reflect vitellogenesis and egg production in females, and altered hydration status and activity in summer. Data from the tortoises in this study will be useful for the seasonal health assessment of this species.",Excluded,0.7400358

Dose-response curves were fitted to the cell survival data by the method of least squares using the multitarget-single hit and the linear-quadratic models. The ten patients could be divided into three distinct groups. Group I consisted of four patients with radioresistant primary tumors (D0s from 1.38 +/- 0.06 Gy to 1.69 +/- 0.08 Gy). The radiation sensitivity of the metastases (D0s from 1.33 +/- 0.10 Gy to 1.73 +/- 0.06 Gy) was not significantly different from that of the primary tumor in this group; i.e., no heterogeneity was observed. Group II consisted of three patients with radiosensitive primary tumors (D0s from 0.84 +/- 0.06 Gy to 0.91 +/- 0.05 Gy). Heterogeneity was not observed in this group either; i.e., all metastases were radiosensitive (D0s from 0.85 +/- 0.05 Gy to 1.00 +/- 0.06 Gy). Group III consisted of three patients with a heterogeneous disease. The primary tumor of all patients in this group was radiosensitive (D0s from 0.85 +/- 0.05 Gy to 1.03 +/- 0.05 Gy). The most radioresistant metastasis in each patient was significantly (P much less than 0.05) more resistant (D0s from 1.46 +/- 0.06 Gy to 1.56 +/- 0.07 Gy) than the primary tumor. None of the metastases were significantly more radiosensitive than the primary tumor in any patient. These observations suggest that the progression of tumors to increased levels of malignancy includes the increased ability to become radioresistant, and it may be speculated that similar genomic alterations are responsible for the development of the metastatic and the radioresistant tumor cell phenotype. If so, this may have severe implications for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma with low linear energy transfer ionizing radiation as well as for the development of predictive assays for tumor treatment sensitivity.",Excluded,0.7143747

A total of 236 persons participated, belonging to 10 different professional groups and working at two Swedish power plants. Job-related radiation risks were judged about average as compared to a number of other risks. On the whole, the participants in the study were satisfied with the measures of safety at work, but there were some exceptions to this rule, especially among those hired for temporary jobs through external contractors. The experience of job-related radiation risks was related to the level of knowledge about radiation and its risks: those who knew less experienced larger risks. General level of anxiety did not correlate with risk perception. The latter was accounted for mainly by perceived radiation risks. Job satisfaction was more strongly related to perceived conventional job risks than to nuclear risks. Risk ratings were related to how subjects defined the concept of risk. Those who stressed consequences as part of their risk definition gave higher risk ratings.",Excluded,0.70084965
1053,"DNA double strand breaks but not interstrand crosslinks prevent progress through meiosis in fully grown mouse oocytes There is some interest in how mammalian oocytes respond to different types of DNA damage because of the increasing expectation of fertility preservation in women undergoing chemotherapy. Double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation and agents such as neocarzinostatin (NCS), and interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by alkylating agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), are toxic DNA lesions that need to be repaired for cell survival. Here we examined the effects of NCS and MMC treatment on oocytes collected from antral follicles in mice, because potentially such oocytes are readily collected from ovaries and do not need to be in vitro grown to achieve meiotic competency. We found that oocytes were sensitive to NCS, such that this ionizing radiation mimetic blocked meiosis I and caused fragmented DNA. In contrast, MMC had no impact on the completion of either meiosis I or II, even at extremely high doses. However, oocytes treated with MMC did show gamma-H2AX foci and following their in vitro maturation and parthenogenetic activation the development of the subsequent embryos was severely compromised. Addition of MMC to 1-cell embryos caused a similarly poor level of development, demonstrating oocytes have eventual sensitivity to this ICL-inducing agent but this does not occur during their meiotic division. In oocytes, the association of Fanconi Anemia protein, FANCD2, with sites of ICL lesions was not apparent until entry into the embryonic cell cycle. In conclusion, meiotic maturation of oocytes is sensitive to DSBs but not ICLs. The ability of oocytes to tolerate severe ICL damage and yet complete meiosis, means that this type of DNA lesion goes unrepaired in oocytes but impacts on subsequent embryo quality.",Excluded,0.68100077
289,"The prostate cancer risk locus at 10q11 is associated with DNA repair capacity Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mildly predict prostate cancer risk. These SNPs are local tagging markers for causal gene alterations. Consideration of candidate genes in the tagged regions would be facilitated by additional information on the particular pathomechanisms which contribute to the observed risk increase. In this study we test for an association of prostate cancer tagging SNPs with alterations in DNA repair capacity, a phenotype that is frequently involved in cancer predisposition. DNA repair capacity was assessed on blood lymphocytes from 128 healthy probands after ionizing irradiation. We used the micronucleus (MN) assay to determine the cellular DNA double-strand break repair capacity and flow cytometry to measure damage induced mitotic delay (MD). Probands were genotyped for a panel of 14 SNPs, each representing an independent prostate cancer risk locus previously identified by GWAS. Associations between germline variants and DNA repair capacity were found for the SNPs rs1512268 (8p21), rs6983267 (8q24) and rs10993994 (10q11). The most significant finding was an association of homozygous rs10993994 T-allele carriers with a lower MN frequency (. p=. 0.0003) and also a decreased MD index (. p=. 0.0353). Cells with prostate cancer risk alleles at rs10993994 seem to cope more efficiently with DNA double strand breaks (less MN) in a shorter time (decreased MD index). This intriguing finding imposes concern about the accuracy of repair, with respect to the cancer risk that is mediated by T genotypes. To date, . MSMB (microseminoprotein beta) is favored as the causal gene at the 10q11 risk locus, since it was the first candidate gene known to be expressionally altered by rs10993994. Based on the present observation, candidate genes from the contexts of DNA repair and apoptosis may be more promising targets for expression studies with respect to the rs10993994 genotype. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.59786224
673,"Heavy ion radiotherapy in lung cancer (Introduction) In radiotherapy of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), carbon ion beams offer improved dose distributions as compared to photon beams and thus enable dose escalation within a target while sparing the surrounding normal tissues. Furthermore, carbon ions being heavier than protons provide a higher biological effectiveness, which increases with depth, reaching the maximum at the end of the range. At the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), clinical research on carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) was started in 1994 using carbon-ions generated by Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). So far, almost 6,000 patients have been treated, where the benefit of C-ion RT over other modalities has been demonstrated in terms of high local control rates and a significant reduction in overall treatment time with acceptable toxicities in most cases. In this paper, the results of treatment for Stage I NSCLC using 9 and 4 fractions are reviewed, as well as preliminary results of single fraction treatment is described. Also, results of other RT reported in the literatures are compared. (Methods and materials) Stage I lung cancer is divided into two types depending on tumor location: peripheral-type and central-type. This classification is made on the assumption that the two types may tolerate radiation differently. Therefore, different fractionation regimens were investigated for each type. The patients eligible for either treatment are those for whom surgery was not indicated due to medical reasons or refusal. From 1999 to 2003, a total of 131 tumors in129 patients received C-ion RT with 9 fractions and 4 fractions, including 94 males and 37 females with an average age of 74.5 years. Out of the 131 foci, there were 72 T1 tumors and 59 T2 tumors. There were 85 adenocarcinomas, 43 epidermoid cancers and 3 other types. Regarding dose fractionations, 51 cases were treated with 72.0GyE/9 fractions, and 80 cases were treated with 52.8GyE/4fr for stage IA and 60.0GyE/4fr for stage IB. Since 2003, a doseescalation study using single fraction treatment has been conducted for peripheral-type NSCLC. The initial dose was 28.0 GyE, which was then escalated at increments of 5%. At each dose level, about 10 to 30 patients were registered for evaluation of toxicity and local control with carbon ions. C-ion RT has also been applied to locally advanced lung cancers and hilar-type cancers, and case studies are being accumulated. The locally advanced lung cancers included Pancoast tumors and mediastinal-type tumors in stages II-IIIA. (Results) All of the patients treated with 9 fractions/3 weeks (50 patients) and 4 fractions/1 week (79 patients) developed no evidence of severe toxicities. The 5-year local control rates were 98.6% for stage-IA cases and 89.7% for stage- IB cases, and the 5-year survival rates were 63.1% for stage-IA cases and 50.0% for stage-IB cases. In single fraction treatment, a total of 218 patients have been registered, in which the total dose has been escalated from 28.0 to 48.0 GyE. So far, no serious adverse events have been observed, and local control appears to be improving with increasing total dose. For skin reactions, six grade 2 toxicity (3.3%) but no grade 3 or higher was observed. For radiation pneumonitis, only one grade 1 was reported, and no toxicities greater than grade 2 occurred. The overall local control rate was 91.8%, and the causespeci fic survival rate at 5-years was 71.8%. The superficial lesions arising at the hilar region have been successfully treated with acceptable toxicities. Similarly, in the preoperative radiotherapy for patients with chest wall invasion, high anti-tumor effect was confirmed in the pathological findings after the lung was surgically removed. (Discussion) Only at NIRS, Japan, NSCLC has been treated with carbon ions. For peripheral tumor, we have been conducting clinical studies to establish a short-course, hypo-fractionated radiotherapy. We first performed a dose-escalation study using 18 fractions/6 weeks. The number of fractions and treatment times were subsequently reduced to 9 fractions over 3 weeks, 4 fractions over one week, and eventually to a single fraction treatment. The preliminary data suggested favorable local control and very few toxic reactions with a median follow up time of about 16 months. Compared with pulmonary damage reported for stereotactic radiotherapy in stage I lung cancer, the incidence and severity in our patients seemed to be remarkably low. The decreased adverse effects on the lung are likely achieved due to the small volume irradiated. When comparing proton vs C-ion RT, local control results are comparable for T1 tumors, but for T2 tumors 2-5 year local control rates are higher in C-ion RT. It is of note that in most reported data for proton therapy, follow-up periods are short relative to the time required for full evaluation of TCP, late NTCP and survival. Considering that the average age of the patients receiving C-ion RT was about 75 years, about 10 years older than that of 65 years in the operated patients, the results of C-ion RT for stage-I lung cancer may be comparable to surgical results. Thus, the single-fraction irradiation method may be described as the ultimate type of treatment using carbon ion, and would be a valid alternative to surgery, especially for elderly and inoperable patients.",Excluded,0.59751445
969,"X-ray-induced sterility in Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) and male longevity following irradiation The mosquito Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1895) is a potent vector of several arboviral diseases, most notably chikungunya and dengue fever. In the context of the sterile insect technique (SIT), the sterilization of the male mosquitoes before their release can be achieved by gamma-ray irradiation. As gamma-ray irradiators are becoming increasingly problematic to purchase and transport, the suitability of an X-ray irradiator as an alternative for the sterilization of Ae. albopictus males was studied. The sterilization of up to 200,000 pupae at one time can be achieved with relative ease, and the sterility results obtained were comparable with those achieved by gamma irradiation, where 99% sterility is induced with a dose of 40 Gy. A significant reduction of longevity was observed in the latter stages of the males' life after irradiation treatments, especially at doses > 40 Gy, which is consistent with the negative effects on longevity induced by similar radiation doses using gamma rays. Females irradiated at 40 Gy were not only 100% sterile, but also failed to oviposit entirely, i.e., all of the females laid 0 eggs. Overall, it was found that the X-ray irradiator is generally suitable for the sterilization process for sterile insect technique programs, as it showed a high processing capacity, practicality, high effectiveness, and reproducibility.",Excluded,0.58891356
