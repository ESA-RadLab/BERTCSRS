925,"Radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes after partial-body exposure to 60Co gamma-irradiation and in vitro exposure to 230 kV X-irradiation Small yields of chromosome aberrations were present in lymphocytes from 12 patients observed at first metaphase in culbure. Blood samples were obtained at various times, up to three days, after single partial-body therapeutic exposure ranging from 75 to 400 rads of 60Co gamma-irradiation. When all patients were considered there was no correlation between treatment dose and aberration frequency, but on subdivision into two groups on the basis of whether the reticuloendothelial system was involved in the cancer, linear regression analysis could be fitted to the data for each group. An in vitro dose response curve for dicentrics induced by 230 kV X rays at a dose rate of 23.3 rads per minute was constructed for use as a standard calibration curve for 48 hour cultures. The yield of dicentric aberrations was best fitted by a power law model, Y = kDn in which k = (1.59 +/- 0.66) 10(-4) and n= 1.49 +/- 0.08, (P =0.96).",Excluded,0.92830896

190,"Lack of high-dose radiation mediated prostate cancer promotion and low-dose radiation adaptive response in the TRAMP mouse model Cancer of the prostate is a highly prevalent disease with a heterogeneous aetiology and prognosis. Current understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the responses of prostate tissue to ionizing radiation exposure, including cancer induction, is surprisingly limited for both high- and low-dose exposures. As population exposure to radiation increases, largely through medical imaging, a better understanding of the response of the prostate to radiation exposure is required. Low-dose radiation-induced adaptive responses for increased cancer latency and decreased cancer frequency have been demonstrated in mouse models, largely for hematological cancers. This study examines the effects of high- and low-dose whole-body radiation exposure on prostate cancer development using an autochthonous mouse model of prostate cancer: TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP). TRAMP mice were exposed to single acute high (2 Gy), low (50 mGy) and repeated low (5 x 50 mGy) doses of X rays to evaluate both the potential prostate cancer promoting effects of high-dose radiation and low-dose adaptive response phenomena in this prostate cancer model. Prostate weights and histopathology were examined to evaluate gross changes in cancer development and, in mice exposed to a single 2 Gy dose, time to palpable tumor was examined. Proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis, DNA damage (gamma-H2AX) and transgene expression (large T-antigen) were examined within TRAMP prostate sections. Neither high- nor low-dose radiation-induced effects on prostate cancer progression were observed for any of the endpoints studied. Lack of observable effects of high- or low-dose radiation exposure suggests that modulation of tumorigenesis in the TRAMP model is largely resistant to such exposures. However, further study is required to better assess the effects of radiation exposure using alternative prostate cancer models that incorporate normal prostate and in those that are not driven by SV40 large T antigen. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.9277145
878,"Effects of beta radiation from organically bound tritium on cultured mouse embryonic mid brain cells Effects of beta radiation from four kinds of organically bound tritium compounds were investigated on cultured mouse embryonic mid brain cells, isolated from 11-d-old mouse embryos. The MBC showed a critical time when they were more radiosensitive. Although dose-dependent inhibition was found for both cellular proliferation and differentiation, the differentiation was more sensitive to radiation than proliferation when compared at ID50, the inhibitory dose that reduced assessment value by 50% of the control. Dose-dependent decrease of DNA and protein contents were also observed. The relative biological effectiveness values, ranging from 4.6 to 8.7, of beta ray from organically bound tritium compounds were obtained when compared with x irradiation at their ID50s on the inhibition of cell proliferation and differentiation, and on the decrease of DNA and protein contents of the cultures. The mixed exposure to x ray and one kind of organically bound tritium compound or to any two kinds of organically bound tritium compound resulted in a more efficiently inhibitory effect on differentiation than the exposure to x ray or to any one kind of organically bound tritium compound alone, especially when methyl-3H-thymidine was used. Doses as low as 0.05 Gy (5 cGy) from a mixed exposure resulted in detectable inhibitory effects.",Excluded,0.9277133

1118,"Radiation-dose response of glycophorin A somatic mutation in erythrocytes associated with gene polymorphisms of p53 binding protein 1 Information on individual variations in response to ionizing radiation is still quite limited. Previous studies of atomic-bomb survivors revealed that somatic mutations at the glycophorin A (GPA) gene locus in erythrocytes were significantly elevated with radiation exposure dose, and that the dose response was significantly higher in survivors with subsequent cancer development compared to those without cancer development. Noteworthy in these studies were great inter-individual differences in GPA mutant fraction even in persons with similar radiation doses. It is hypothesized that persistent GPA mutations in erythrocytes of atomic-bomb survivors are derived from those in long-lived hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations, and that individual genetic backgrounds, specifically related to DNA double-strand break repair, contribute to individual differences in HSC mutability following radiation exposure. Thus, we examined the relationship between radiation exposure, GPA mutant fraction in erythrocytes, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the key gene involved in DNA double-strand break repair, p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1). 53BP1 SNPs and inferred haplotypes demonstrated a significant interaction with radiation dose, suggesting that radiation-dose response of GPA somatic mutation is partly dependent on 53BP1 genotype. It is also possible that 53BP1 plays a significant role in DNA double-strand break repair in HSCs following radiation exposure. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

331,"HPRT-mutant frequency and lymphocyte characteristics of workers exposed to ionizing radiation on a sporadic basis: a comparison of two exposure indicators, job title and dose Using the clonal HPRT-mutant frequency assay, mutant frequencies of humans have been shown to rise following exposure to large doses of mutagens during radiotherapy, chemotherapy or after an atom bomb explosion. Success in relating mutant frequencies to exposure to high levels of mutagens has encouraged researchers to examine the effects of lower doses, such as those found among workers exposed at their jobs. In order to relate low doses of mutagens to biological effects, accurate characterization of exposure is critical, but most occupational studies are forced to use gross measures of exposure derived from job title or professional judgments as to potential exposure. Mutant frequencies and other relevant lymphocyte characteristics of 58 industrial workers were related to exposure status in two ways. When workers were classed as ""exposed"" or ""unexposed"" to ionizing radiation, no difference in any biological variable was seen between the two groups. When dosimeter readings were used as the exposure indicator, significant relationships appeared between dose and mutant frequency and CD4/CD8 lymphocyte subpopulation ratios. Mutant frequency was also positively related to age and smoking status. The time course of exposure and of appearance of mutant cells is discussed and it is suggested that this relationship receive attention in occupational studies of genotoxic effects.",Excluded,0.9273703
549,"Mortality among individuals exposed to atomic bomb radiation in utero: 1950-2012 We examined the mortality risks among 2463 individuals who were exposed in utero to atomic bomb radiation in Hiroshima or Nagasaki in August 1945 and were followed from October 1950 through 2012. Individual estimates of mother's weighted absorbed uterine dose (DS02R1) were used. Poisson regression method was used to estimate the radiation-associated excess relative risk per Gy (ERR/Gy) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cause-specific mortality. Head size, birth weight, and parents' survival status were evaluated as potential mediators of radiation effect. There were 339 deaths (216 males and 123 females) including deaths from solid cancer (n = 137), lymphohematopoietic cancer (n = 8), noncancer disease (n = 134), external cause (n = 56), and unknown cause (n = 4). Among males, the unadjusted ERR/Gy (95% CI) was increased for noncancer disease mortality (1.22, 0.10-3.14), but not for solid cancer mortality (- 0.18, < - 0.77-0.95); the unadjusted ERR/Gy for external cause mortality was not statistically significant (0.28, < - 0.60-2.36). Among females, the unadjusted ERRs/Gy were increased for solid cancer (2.24, 0.44-5.58), noncancer (2.86, 0.56-7.64), and external cause mortality (2.57, 0.20-9.19). The ERRs/Gy adjusted for potential mediators did not change appreciably for solid cancer mortality, but decreased notably for noncancer mortality (0.39, < - 0.43-1.91 for males; 1.48, - 0.046-4.55 for females) and external cause mortality (0.10, < - 0.57-1.96 for males; 1.38, < - 0.46-5.95 for females). In conclusion, antenatal radiation exposure is a consistent risk factor for increased solid cancer mortality among females, but not among males. The effect of exposure to atomic bomb radiation on noncancer disease and external cause mortality among individuals exposed in utero was mediated through small head size, low birth weight, and parental loss.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.9272931
1074,"Effect of thoracic irradiation on hepatocyte growth factor in rats lung and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with thoracic malignancies This study aimed to examine the physiological role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) after thoracic irradiation. We analysed the changes of HGF protein levels in rat lung following 12 Gy of whole thoracic irradiation. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was then collected from 11 patients (10 lung cancer and one oesophageal cancer) after completion of radiation therapy. One month after irradiation, the HGF protein level in the lungs of irradiated rats decreased (p<0.05), followed by a remarkable elevation in HGF protein levels 2 (p<0.05) and 3 months (nonsignificant) after irradiation accompanied by the clinical appearance of radiation pneumonitis. Finally, HGF protein levels in the lung returned to their original level 6 months after thoracic irradiation. In humans, HGF protein levels in the BALF in the limited irradiated area were lower than those obtained from unirradiated areas (p<0.05). In conclusion, hepatocyte growth factor production is transiently suppressed in the irradiated area after irradiation.",Excluded,0.9272736

513,"Reciprocal translocations as an indicator for radiation exposures in the low dose range A few years back, the frequency of dicentrics was determined shortly after exposure in five accidentally exposed radiation workers. In all cases the observed dicentric yield was significantly higher in comparison with the background level, and the resulting estimated whole body doses lay between 0.2 and 0.3 Gy. Now, a number of years later (1 to 11 years), the frequency of translocations has been determined by means of the FISH technique. Chromosomes 2, 4 and 8 were painted. The measured translocation frequency lay, however, within the range of the spontaneous variation between individuals. No radiation exposure could, therefore, be proven. In two further cases, the dicentrics were determined by means of the conventional Giemsa staining technique, and the translocations by means of chromosome painting carried out on the same blood samples, which were taken about 3 and 10 years, respectively, after the radiation exposure. The dose estimates obtained on the basis of dicentric frequency using the Qdr method, and on the basis of FISH detected translocations, are compared.

It is known that ionizing radiation may have damaging effects on chromosomes. In the present study, we investigated the genotoxic effects of ionizing radiation on nuclear medicine workers. We used two different indicators of genotoxicity methods: sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronucleus (MN)., METHODS: The present research was carried out using 21 nuclear medicine workers (11 females and 10 males) during two periods: during normal working conditions and after a 1-month vacation. The radiation dose varied from 1.20 to 48.56 mSv, which accumulated during the occupational exposure time between two vacations. Peripheral blood samples were taken from each subject for two distinct lymphocyte cultures (SCE and MN) in each period., RESULTS: In nearly all subjects, SCE values increased significantly during radiation exposure compared to the postvacation period (P<.05). Similarly, MN frequencies in most of the subjects increased significantly during radiation exposure compared to the postvacation period (P<.05)., CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that both SCE and MN frequencies in most of the subjects were significantly higher during exposure to ionizing radiation than after a 1-month vacation period. However, this genotoxic effect was reversible in most of the subjects.",Excluded,0.92684007
807,"Mayak worker dosimetry study: an overview The Mayak Production Association (MPA) was the first plutonium production plant in the former Soviet Union. Workers at the MPA were exposed to relatively large internal radiation intakes and external radiation exposures, particularly in the early years of plant operations. This paper describes the updated dosimetry database, ""Doses-2005."" Doses-2005 represents a significant improvement in the determination of absorbed organ dose from external radiation and plutonium intake for the original cohort of 18,831 Mayak workers. The methods of dose reconstruction of absorbed organ doses from external radiation uses: 1) archive records of measured dose and worker exposure history, 2) measured energy and directional response characteristics of historical Mayak film dosimeters, and 3) calculated dose conversion factors for Mayak Study-defined exposure scenarios using Monte Carlo techniques. The methods of dose reconstruction for plutonium intake uses two revised models developed from empirical data derived from bioassay and autopsy cases and/or updates from prevailing or emerging International Commission on Radiological Protection models. Other sources of potential significant exposure to workers such as medical diagnostic x-rays, ambient onsite external radiation, neutron radiation, intake of airborne effluent, and intake of nuclides other than plutonium were evaluated to determine their impact on the dose estimates.",Excluded,0.9266301

265,"Characteristics of induced mutations in offspring derived from irradiated mouse spermatogonia and mature oocytes The exposure of germ cells to radiation introduces mutations in the genomes of offspring, and a previous whole-genome sequencing study indicated that the irradiation of mouse sperm induces insertions/deletions (indels) and multisite mutations (clustered single nucleotide variants and indels). However, the current knowledge on the mutation spectra is limited, and the effects of radiation exposure on germ cells at stages other than the sperm stage remain unknown. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing experiments to investigate the exposure of spermatogonia and mature oocytes. We compared de novo mutations in a total of 24 F1 mice conceived before and after the irradiation of their parents. The results indicated that radiation exposure, 4 Gy of gamma rays, induced 9.6 indels and 2.5 multisite mutations in spermatogonia and 4.7 indels and 3.1 multisite mutations in mature oocytes in the autosomal regions of each F1 individual. Notably, we found two types of deletions, namely, small deletions (mainly 1~12 nucleotides) in non-repeat sequences, many of which showed microhomology at the breakpoint junction, and single-nucleotide deletions in mononucleotide repeat sequences. The results suggest that these deletions and multisite mutations could be a typical signature of mutations induced by parental irradiation in mammals.",Excluded,0.92644525

An experimental autoallergic sialadenitis (EAS) of the rat submandibular gland was developed to serve as the standard lesion. Consistently mild or severe lesions of EAS were induced in male Lewis rats when they were immunized with allogeneic submandibular glands from sexually immature or mature female donors, respectively. Neck irradiation alone 7-56 days prior to sacrifice induced only occasional inflammatory lesions in the submandibular glands. The weights of the submandibular glands were seen to decrease progressively while the body weights continued to rise. Neck irradiation 7-56 days prior to sacrifice of animals immunized 7-21 days prior to sacrifice to induce mild or severe EAS did not significantly accelerate development of the lesion nor w,as the intensity of inflammatory lesions significantly modified. In nanimals with mild or severe EAS which were neck irradiated, the weights of the submandibular glands were found to decrease while the body weight remained relatively unchanged.

653,"Radiation-induced micro-RNA expression changes in peripheral blood cells of radiotherapy patients Purpose: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding small RNAs that regulate gene expression, are involved in numerous physiologic processes in normal and malignant cells. Our in vivo study measured miRNA and gene expression changes in human blood cells in response to ionizing radiation, to develop miRNA signatures that can be used as biomarkers for radiation exposure. Methods and Materials: Blood from 8 radiotherapy patients in complete remission 1 or 2 was collected immediately before and 4 hours after total body irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays. Both miRNA and gene expression changes were measured by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction and microarray hybridization, respectively. Hierarchic clustering, multidimensional scaling, class prediction, and gene ontology analysis were performed to investigate the potential of miRNAs to serve as radiation biomarkers and to elucidate their likely physiologic roles in the radiation response. Result(s): The expression levels of 45 miRNAs were statistically significantly upregulated 4 hours after irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays, 27 of them in every patient. Nonirradiated and irradiated samples form separate clusters in hierarchic clustering and multidimensional scaling. Out of 223 differentially expressed genes, 37 were both downregulated and predicted targets of the upregulated miRNAs. Paired and unpaired miRNA-based classifiers that we developed can predict the class membership of a sample with unknown irradiation status, with accuracies of 100% when all 45 upregulated miRNAs are included. Both miRNA control of and gene involvement in biologic processes such as hemopoiesis and the immune response are increased after irradiation, whereas metabolic processes are underrepresented among all differentially expressed genes and the genes controlled by miRNAs. Conclusion(s): Exposure to ionizing radiation leads to the upregulation of the expression of a considerable proportion of the human miRNAome of peripheral blood cells. These miRNA expression signatures can be used as biomarkers of radiation exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.9259338

The frequency of X-chromosome breaks was judged based on the frequency of X0 males occurrence. Synergism of the effects of X-rays (at doses 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 kr) and of hyperthermia (+37 degrees C, 5.5 hours) applied after irradiation served as an indirect evidence for the functioning of DNA repair systems. It is demonstrated that radiosensitivity of mature oocytes of the lines compared was equal and that hyperthermia applied after irradiation increased the latter effect in both lines. Young oocytes of the control line were radioresistant, and hyperthermia applied after irradiation enhanced its effect. Opposite to them, young oocytes of the rad line females were radiosensitive. They did not differ from mature oocytes in the frequency of X-chromosome losses. Synergism of the two factors (irradiation and hyperthermia) was not registered in young oocytes. On the basis of the results obtained, it may be concluded that radiosensitivity of young oocytes in the hypersensitive line is conditioned by the failure of DNA repair systems and that the rad (2) 201G1 gene may be considered, in relation to the genes controlling DNA repair, as a suppressor functioning selectively at a certain stage of oogenesis.",Excluded,0.92580855
296,"Dose-response relationships for radiation-induced hyperparathyroidism It has been hard to establish with certainty that radiation exposure is a risk factor for developing hyperparathyroidism. In part this is because many cases of hyperparathyroidism remain asymptomatic and escape clinical detection. We present results from a study of 2555 subjects who received external beam radiotherapy to the head and neck area for benign conditions before their 16th birthday between 1939 and 1962. The average length of follow-up was 36.6 yr. There were 36 confirmed cases of hyperparathyroidism. Based on a relative risk model, the excess relative risk increased significantly by 0.11/centigray; however, the confidence interval was wide (95% confidence interval, 0.0-17.2). The hyperparathyroidism rates and dose-response relationships were not affected by gender or age at first radiation treatment.

846,"An approach to the assessment of risk from chronic radiation to populations of European lobster, Homarus gammarus (L.) The basic principles underlying a four-discrete age group, logistic, growth model for the European lobster Homarus gammarus are presented and discussed at proof-of-concept level. The model considers reproduction, removal by predation, natural death, fishing, radiation and migration. Non-stochastic effects of chronic low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation are modelled with emphasis on (99)Tc, using three endpoints: repairable radiation damage, impairment of reproductive ability and, at higher dose rates, mortality. An allometric approach for the calculation of LD(50/30) as a function of the mass of each life stage is used in model calibration. The model predicts that at a dose rate of 1 Gy day(-1), lobster population reproduction and survival become severely compromised, leading eventually to population extinction. At 0.01 Gy day(-1), the survival rate of an isolated population is reduced by 10%, mainly through loss of fecundity, comparable to natural migration losses. Fishing is the main ecological stress and only dose rates in the range 0.03-0.1 Gy day(-1) can achieve discernible effects above it. On the balance of radiation and other ecological stresses, a benchmark value of 0.01 Gy day(-1) is proposed for the protection of lobster populations. This value appears consistent with available information on radiation effects in wildlife.",Excluded,0.925616
892,"The development and biological characteristics of a novel potentially radioresistant inbred mouse strain The growth of biomedical research over the previous decades has been accompanied by an increase in the number, complexity and diversity of experimental animals developed as research tools, and inbred mice are some of the most widely used. However, thus far, no inbred mice have exhibited strong radioresistance for use in radiation-damage research. To develop a radioresistant mouse model, a female Japanese outbreeding strain ICR/JCL mouse was mated with a male Chinese inbred strain 615 mouse. From the F1 generation, the mouse line was maintained by brother-to-sister mating. A novel mouse strain was established over >20 continuous generations and designated the Institute of Radiation Medicine-2 (IRM-2) mouse. The biological characteristics, genetic characteristics and susceptibility to radiation of these mice were determined. The IRM-2 mice inherited traits from the parents, including strong reproductive capacity, stable physiological and biochemical indices and few differences among individuals. According to the genetic results, the IRM-2 mice exhibited homozygosity, isogenicity and consistency, in agreement with international standards for inbred strains. Radiosensitivity studies have previously suggested that the lethal dose (LD)50 values for IRM-2 mice were 7.17 Gy (male) and 7.5 Gy (female), resulting in a dose reduction factor value of 1.39 (male) and 1.37 (female). The mortality of IRM-2 mice irradiated with 8 Gy total body irradiation was 15% at day 9 and 90% at day 15 after radiation. The number of nucleated cells in bone marrow, DNA content and colony-forming unit-spleen counts in IRM-2 mice after exposure to gamma-ray irradiation were markedly higher than the corresponding values for the parental strains, suggesting that the IRM-2 mice exhibit high resistance to ionizing radiation.

There was no significant effect of tooth surfaces and exposure with single X-rays on the measured absorbed dose of an individual. The mean measured absorbed dose of the population is 34 +/- 6.2 mGy, with an average tooth enamel age of 39 years. From the slope of a regression line, the estimated annual background dose for Peninsular Malaysia is 0.6 +/- 0.3 mGy y(-1).

Protection from cosmic radiation of crews of long-term space missions is now becoming an urgent requirement to allow a safe colonization of the moon and Mars. Epidemiology provides little help to quantify the risk, because the astronaut group is small and as yet mostly involved in low-Earth orbit mission, whilst the usual cohorts used for radiation protection on Earth (e.g. atomic bomb survivors) were exposed to a radiation quality substantially different from the energetic charged particle field found in space. However, there are over 260,000 patients treated with accelerated protons or heavier ions for different types of cancer, and this cohort may be useful for quantifying the effects of space-like radiation in humans.

One thousand binucleated cells were systematically scored for micronuclei. A linear-quadratic dose dependency of the micronucleus yields was observed. The data were used to derive the accuracy of the dose assessment with the technique in case of a radiation accident. It was shown that for doses of 2 Gy and higher, the uncertainty of the dose was predominantly due to interindividual differences in the x-ray-induced micronucleus yields. At the 95% confidence level, doses lower than 0.3 Gy could not be unequivocally detected with the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay due to the variability of the baseline micronucleus frequency within the donor population and the poor statistical accuracy when scoring 1,000 cells.

Two subpopulations were analyzed: all measured cases who survived at least 5 yr after the start of employment and all cases who survived at least 2 yr after first measurement. The first constituted a group based on year of entry; it contained 1468 women who experienced 42 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.4.

Incidence (I) was in units of bone sarcomas per person-yr; (D) was the quantity (muCi) of radium that entered the blood. Two functions, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD and I = (C + beta D2)e-gammaD, fit the data for year of entry (p greater than or equal to 0.05); both these functions and I = (C + alpha D) fit the data for first measurement.

Thirty-seven subjects with HNSCC and 35 healthy donors were enrolled in the study. The extent of DNA damage including oxidative lesions and efficiency of the repair were examined by alkaline comet assay. HNSCC cancer cells were more sensitive to genotoxic treatment and displayed impaired DNA repair. In particular, lesions caused by gamma-radiation were repaired less effectively in metastasis of HNSCC than in healthy controls. The differences in radiation sensitivity of cancer and control cells suggested that DNA repair might be critical for HNSCC treatment. We conclude that gamma-radiation might be considered as an effective therapeutic strategy for head and neck cancers, including patients in advanced stage of the disease with clear evidence of metastasis.",Excluded,0.92539424
753,"Induction of micronuclei in human sperm-hamster egg hybrids at the two-cell stage after in vitro gamma-irradiation of human spermatozoa The efficiency of the micronucleus test to assess radiation-induced chromosomal damage in human spermatozoa has been investigated. Micronuclei were scored in human sperm-hamster egg hybrids at the two-cell stage, after exposure of human spermatozoa to in vitro gamma-rays at doses of 0.00, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, and 4.00 Gy. The relationship between the yield of micronuclei per two-cell stage as well as the percentage of two-cell stages with micronuclei and the different doses of irradiation were fitted to linear equations. To evaluate whether scoring micronuclei is useful for the quantification of chromosomal damage occurring in human spermatozoa, induced micronuclei at the different doses of sperm irradiation were compared to the induction of breaks and fragments in sperm-derived chromosomes. After interspecific fertilization of zona-free hamster oocytes by irradiated spermatozoa, a total of 699 fertilized eggs at the two-cell stage and a total of 387 sperm-derived complements were analyzed. The incidence of fertilized eggs with micronuclei at the two-cell stage coincided well with the incidence of sperm-derived chromosome breaks and fragments (e.g., 8.9% vs. 6.7% in the 0.25 Gy group and 52.8% vs. 58.6% in the 4.00 Gy group). A similar correlation was found between the number of micronuclei per two-cell stage and the number of breaks and fragments per sperm complement (0.09 vs. 0.07 in the 0.25 Gy group and 0.71 vs. 0.81 in the 4.00 Gy group). The results show that this test system can be used for the quantification of spontaneous or induced chromosomal damage in human spermatozoa.",Excluded,0.9252431

The plating efficiency for 11 of the 14 melanomas studied was sufficiently high (PE = 0.3-58%) to measure cell survival over at least two decades. Experiments repeated with cells stored in liquid nitrogen showed that the survival assay gave highly reproducible results. The melanomas exhibited individual and characteristic survival curves whether exposed to radiation or heat (43.5 degrees C). The Do-values were in the ranges 0.63-1.66 Gy (X-rays) and 33-58 min (heat). The survival curves were similar to those reported previously for human melanoma xenografts. The radiation sensitivity of the cells was not correlated to the heat sensitivity. Since the melanomas appeared to be very heterogeneous in radiation response in vitro as melanomas are known to be clinically, it is suggested that melanomas may be suitable for prospective studies aimed at establishing whether clinical radioresponsiveness somehow is related to in vitro survival curve parameters.",Excluded,0.9251798
599,"Mortality Analysis of the Life Span Study (LSS) Cohort Taking into Account Multiple Causes of Death Indicated in Death Certificates Mortality analyses have been performed using underlying causes of death as reported on death certificates; these are uniquely determined for a deceased person according to the World Health Organization coding system. Comorbidities, the disease conditions other than the underlying cause of death from death certificates recording multiple causes of death, have rarely been explored in Life Span Study subjects. The purpose of this study was to clarify associations between atomic bomb radiation exposure and mortality from combinations of the underlying cause of death and comorbidities. The focused follow-up period was 1977-2003, prior to which death certificate accuracy was unreliable. The study cohort was comprised of 10,017 people for whom the category ""all circulatory disease"" was listed as the underlying cause of death, of which heart disease (rheumatic, hypertensive and ischemic heart disease) and stroke were major subtypes. Comorbidities considered were pneumonia, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer and the major circulatory disease subtypes listed above. Poisson regression models were used for analyses. Excess relative risks (ERRs) for mortality at 1 Gy were significantly increased when cancer was comorbid with all circulatory disease, heart disease, ischemic heart disease or stroke, ranging from 0.61 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.13, 1.41; N = 177 for all circulatory diseases to 1.60 (CI: 0.07, 4.86; N = 42) for ischemic heart disease. Among the other comorbidities, only diabetes comorbid with heart disease had a significant radiation dose response (ERR at 1 Gy of 0.62, CI: 0.10, 1.46; N = 128). It remains uncertain if the high ERRs with comorbid cancers were anomalous due to the small number of cases or some dissimilarity in statistical methodologies, or if this might suggest some pathogenetic basis for increased fatality. For this reason, further investigation is required.Copyright © 2017 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.92509204
335,"Dose-dependent expression of CLIP2 in post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid carcinomas A previous study on papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) in young patients who were exposed to 131iodine from the Chernobyl fallout revealed an exclusive gain of chromosomal band 7q11.23 in exposed cases compared to an age-matched control cohort. CLIP2, a gene located within band 7q11.23 was shown to be differentially expressed between exposed and non-exposed cases at messenger RNA and protein level. Therefore, a standardized procedure for CLIP2 typing of PTCs has been developed in a follow-up study. Here we used CLIP2 typing data on 117 post-Chernobyl PTCs from two cohorts of exposed patients with individual dose estimates and 24 non-exposed controls to investigate a possible quantitative dose-response relationship of the CLIP2 marker. The 'Genrisk-T' cohort consisted of 45 PTCs and the 'UkrAm' cohort of 72 PTCs. Both cohorts differed in mean dose (0.59 Gy Genrisk-T, 1.2 Gy UkrAm) and mean age at exposure (AaE) (2 years Genrisk-T, 8 years UkrAm), whilst the median latency (16 years Genrisk-T, 18 years UkrAm) was comparable. We analyzed the association between the binary CLIP2 typing and continuous thyroid dose with logistic regression. A clear positive dose-response relationship was found for young PTC cases [age at operation (AaO) < 20 years, AaE < 5 years]. In the elder age group a higher proportion of sporadic tumors is assumed due to a negligible dose response, suggesting different molecular mechanisms in sporadic and radiation-induced cases. This is further supported by the association of elder patients (AaO > 20 years) with positivity for BRAF V600E mutation.Copyright © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

671,"Inter-laboratory comparison of cytogenetic endpoints for the biomonitoring of radiological workers Purpose: The evaluation of different cytogenetic endpoints of radiation damage for the biomonitoring of contract workers temporarily employed at nuclear power plants. Material(s) and Method(s): Blood samples from six donors were irradiated in vitro with doses ranging from 0.1 to 2 Gy 60Co gamma-rays. Compared were a conventional analysis for dicentrics, the conventional micronucleus (MN) assay, the centromere micronucleus assay using p82H and an alphaAllCen pancentromeric probe, and tricolour FISH with chromosome 2, 4 and 8 DNA probes for the scoring of translocations. Result(s): Agreement in the number of MN between Giemsa-and propidium iodine fluorescence-stained preparations was obtained. The control samples showed higher centromere positivity for the MN after FISH with the p82H probe compared with the alphaAllCen probe. The MN results with both probes showed a slight but systematic increase in the number of centromere-positive MN with dose, indicating that radiation, although principally clastogenic, also has aneuploidogenic properties. The values of the genomic translocation frequency (F(G)) derived from the observed translocation frequencies were systematically higher than the dicentric yields. Comparing the sensitivity of the different methods with restriction of the scoring time to 1 day for biomonitoring purposes, the centromere micronucleus assay had the lowest dose detection limit (0.1 to 0.2 Gy). Conclusion(s): This study shows that at present only the centromere micronucleus assay can combine high sensitivity with a reasonable scoring time for the biomonitoring of relatively large populations.",Excluded,0.92470056

Both young and adult, un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters were highly susceptible to L. carinii but mice (un-irradiated or irradiated) were poor hosts. All hamsters (18 un-irradiated and seven irradiated) became infected. Seven out of nine mice in an un-irradiated series became infected. There was apparently 'age resistance' or 'young susceptibility' in the hamsters. The susceptibility of young hamsters appeared similar to that of new-born Carworth white rats and cotton rats. The pattern of infection in un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters was similar. Results from irradiated animals were insufficient to draw any clear conclusions on the effect of irradiation to susceptibility to infection with L. carinii.

Methods and Materials: Data from 93 head and neck radiotherapy patients treated between 1997 and 2008 were analyzed retrospectively. The main effect, radiation dose to the individual teeth, was evaluated with covariates of elapsed time after radiation, xerostomia, topical fluoride use, and oral hygiene status included. Patients' radiotherapy plans were used to calculate cumulative exposure for each tooth. Patients' teeth were evaluated using a validated index and then categorized as having none-slight or moderate-severe post-radiation damage. Result(s): Patients (31 females, 62 males) ranged in age from 18-82 years (mean 57). The number of teeth-patient ranged from 3-30 (mean 20) with a total of 1873 teeth evaluated. Overall, 51% of teeth had moderate-severe damage, with the remaining having little or none. Using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, the odds for moderate-severe damage were 2-3 times greater for teeth exposed to between 30 and 60 Gy as compared to no radiation. However, for teeth exposed to >= 60 Gy as compared to no radiation the odds of moderate-severe tooth damage was greater by a magnitude of 10 times. Conclusion(s): The results indicate that there is minimal tooth damage below 30 Gy (salivary gland threshold), a greater than 1:1 increased dose-response between 30 and 60 Gy likely related to salivary gland damage, and a critical threshold of >= 60 Gy, which may be linked to direct effects of radiation on tooth structure.

707,"Chromosomal principle of radiation-induced F1 sterility in Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) A dose-response analysis of chromosomal aberrations was performed in male progeny of gamma-irradiated males in the flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella. For comparison, several female progeny from each dose level were examined. Aberrations were detected on microspread preparations of pachytene nuclei in the electron microscope and classified according to pairing configurations of synaptonemal complexes (SCs). Fragmentation and various translocations were the most numerous aberrations, whereas interstitial deletion and inversion were rare. At 100 Gy, relatively simple multiple translocations were found. Multiple translocations showing complicated configurations occurred at 150 and 200 Gy, and their number increased with the dose. In males, the mean number of chromosomal breaks resulting in aberrations linearly increased with the dose from 8.4 to 16.2 per nucleus. In females, this value achieved a maximum of 11.2 breaks/nucleus at 200 Gy. Three factors were suggested to contribute to the reported higher level of F1 sterility in males than females: (i) survival of males with high numbers of breaks, (ii) crossing-over in spermatogenesis but not in the achiasmatic oogenesis, and (iii) a higher impact of induced changes on the fertility of males than females. It was concluded that translocations are most responsible for the production of unbalanced gametes resulting in sterility of F1 moths. However, F1 sterility predicted according to the observed frequency of aberrations was much higher than the actual sterility reported earlier. This suggests a regulation factor which corrects the predicted unbalanced state towards balanced segregation of translocated chromosomes.",Excluded,0.9237836

Therefore, the effect of orientin and vicenin on radiation-induced lipid peroxidation in vivo and their antioxidant activity in vitro were studied. Adult mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mug/kg of orientin or vicenin and exposed whole-body to 3 Gy of gamma radiation. Lipid peroxidation was measured in the liver 15 min to 8 h postirradiation. The antioxidant activity of orientin/vicenin (10-500 muM) was studied by measuring inhibition of hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction (Fe3+-EDTA-ascorbic acid-H2O2) in vitro. The compounds were also tested for possible pro-oxidant and iron chelation activities at the above concentrations in the in vitro system. Orientin and vicenin provided almost equal protection against radiation-induced lipid peroxidation in mouse liver. Both compounds showed a significantly greater free radical-inhibiting activity in vitro than DMSO. Neither orientin nor vicenin showed any pro-oxidant activity at the concentrations tested. Both compounds inhibited free radical formation in the absence of EDTA. Free radical scavenging appears to be a likely mechanism of radiation protection by these flavonoids.

Some 5% of solar radiation is within the ultraviolet spectrum and may cause both malignant melanoma and non-melanocytic skin cancer; the latter is regarded as a benign disease and is accordingly not included in our estimation of avoidable cancers. Under the assumption that the rate of occurrence of malignant melanoma of the buttocks of both men and women and of the scalp of women would apply to all parts of the body in people completely unexposed to solar radiation, it was estimated that approximately 95% of all malignant melanomas arising in the Nordic populations around the year 2000 will be due to exposure to natural ultraviolet radiation, equivalent to an annual number of about 4700 cases, with 2100 in men and 2600 in women, or some 4% of all cancers notified. Exposure to ionizing radiation in the Nordic countries occurs at an average effective dose per capita per year of about 3 mSv (Iceland, 1.1 mSv) from natural sources, and about 1 mSv from man-made sources. While the natural sources are primarily radon in indoor air, natural radionuclides in food, cosmic radiation and gamma radiation from soil and building materials, the man-made sources are dominated by the diagnostic and therapeutic use of ionizing radiation. On the basis of measured levels of radon in Nordic dwellings and associated risk estimates for lung cancer derived from well-conducted epidemiological studies, we estimated that about 180 cases of lung cancer (1% of all lung cancer cases) per year could be avoided in the Nordic countries around the year 2000 if indoor exposure to radon were eliminated, and that an additional 720 cases (6%) could be avoided annually if either radon or tobacco smoking were eliminated. Similarly, it was estimated that the exposure of the Nordic populations to natural sources of ionizing radiation other than radon and to medical sources will each give rise to an annual total of 2120 cancers at various sites. For all types of ionizing radiation, the annual total will be 4420 cancer cases, or 3.9% of all cancers arising in the Nordic populations, with 3.4% in men and 4.4% in women.",Excluded,0.9232046

There are reports that intense prolonged occupational exposure to non-ionizing radiation may increase risks for cancer. We previously have reported a sentinel cluster, of 7 workers with high exposures and short latent periods, and individual patients with brain cancer high occupational exposures and short latent periods. We present a sentinel case series (n=47, 40M, 7F) of cancer patients, referred to our medical unit with occupational exposures to non-ionizing radiation of all types. Objectives. Our aims were to report the findings on tumour types, age of first diagnosis, and latency, to describe their exposures and to examine the hypothesis that latencies for all tumour types (solid tissue, hematolymphatic, testicular) were coherently related to high occupational exposures starting at young ages. Methods. We divided the patients into groups by latency. We categorized each patient's exposures in regard to types of radiation, far or near field exposure and direct body contact. For some we had data on frequencies, for others we provided assessments. We also present the patient data categorized by age of diagnosis.We used a case-case type comparison to examine latencies for tumour types [solid, hematolymphatic (HL), testicular]. Results. 15 patients developed cancer with latent periods of less than 5 years and 12 patients with latent periods between 5 and 10 years. The remaining 20 patients had longer latent periods between first occupational exposure to EMF and diagnosis of cancer. 6 patients (12.7%) had multiple tumours. 12 patients (25.5%) reported cancer cases in co-workers. In the <5 years latency group there were 8 hematolymphatic cancers, 3 testicular cancers and 6 solid tumours [head & neck (including brain) and GI tract]. In all latency groups there were patients who were exposed to intense levels of electromagnetic fields (EMF), to several types of EMF, or to EMF in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) or other exposures, and patients who had direct body contact with the equipment, were in direct focus of high radiation, or worked in small, electronically dense environments. Case classification by age showed shorter latencies with younger ages, but this association is complicated by the fact that shorter latencies co-vary with younger ages especially for testicular tumours. But patients with testicular and hematolymphatic tumours had shorter latencies than those with solid tumours. Conclusion. Many of the patients were young and had extremely short latent periods, especially for HL and testicular cancers. The fact that latent periods for testes were very short, HL longer and solid still longer suggests a coherent and biologically plausible pattern of latency in relation to the onset of exposure to EMF and other agents. The findings strengthen the hypothesis that these exposures may possibly be the major cause of many of these tumours. The findings state the case for (1) better modelling of exposure sources and penetration into the body and (2) preventive and protective measures based on control of exposure at source, barriers, and personal protection.",Excluded,0.92292535

Dose-response curves were fitted to the cell survival data by the method of least squares using the multitarget-single hit and the linear-quadratic models. The ten patients could be divided into three distinct groups. Group I consisted of four patients with radioresistant primary tumors (D0s from 1.38 +/- 0.06 Gy to 1.69 +/- 0.08 Gy). The radiation sensitivity of the metastases (D0s from 1.33 +/- 0.10 Gy to 1.73 +/- 0.06 Gy) was not significantly different from that of the primary tumor in this group; i.e., no heterogeneity was observed. Group II consisted of three patients with radiosensitive primary tumors (D0s from 0.84 +/- 0.06 Gy to 0.91 +/- 0.05 Gy). Heterogeneity was not observed in this group either; i.e., all metastases were radiosensitive (D0s from 0.85 +/- 0.05 Gy to 1.00 +/- 0.06 Gy). Group III consisted of three patients with a heterogeneous disease. The primary tumor of all patients in this group was radiosensitive (D0s from 0.85 +/- 0.05 Gy to 1.03 +/- 0.05 Gy). The most radioresistant metastasis in each patient was significantly (P much less than 0.05) more resistant (D0s from 1.46 +/- 0.06 Gy to 1.56 +/- 0.07 Gy) than the primary tumor. None of the metastases were significantly more radiosensitive than the primary tumor in any patient. These observations suggest that the progression of tumors to increased levels of malignancy includes the increased ability to become radioresistant, and it may be speculated that similar genomic alterations are responsible for the development of the metastatic and the radioresistant tumor cell phenotype. If so, this may have severe implications for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma with low linear energy transfer ionizing radiation as well as for the development of predictive assays for tumor treatment sensitivity.",Excluded,0.92251927

However, the regulatory events of NAMPT in response to the irradiated salivary gland are unknown., METHODS AND MATERIALS: The cell viability of primary cultured submandibular gland cells was determined using the PrestoBlue assay. NAMPT expression was measured using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting in vitro and in vivo. Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and phosphorylated Akt protein levels were examined by Western blotting. The cellular locations of NAMPT and SIRT1 were detected by immunohistochemistry. NAMPT promoter activity was assessed using the luciferase reporter gene assay., RESULTS: NAMPT was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of granular convoluted tubule cells and ductal cells in normal submandibular glands. mRNA and protein expression of NAMPT was downregulated after radiation but upregulated with phenylephrine pretreatment both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the protein expression of phosphorylated Akt and SIRT1 was decreased in irradiated glands, and phenylephrine pretreatment restored the expression of both. SIRT1 was mainly located in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm in the normal submandibular gland. Phenylephrine dramatically enhanced the expression of SIRT1, which was significantly reduced by radiation. Furthermore, phenylephrine induced a marked increase of NAMPT promoter activity., CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the regulatory mechanisms of NAMPT expression, which help to understand the mechanism of the cytoprotective role of phenylephrine on irradiated tissues.

915,"The role of autophagy regulator LC3B in thyroid cancer cells response to metabolic stress and radiation Decreased expression of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B), a well-characterized regulator of autophagy, has been shown to be associated with metastatic progression in patients with thyroid cancer. We hypothesized that LC3B could play a role in the regulation of thyroid cancer cells response to radiation. Expression of LC3B was examined by real-time PCR and Western blot in FTC133, FTC236 and FTC238 cells. Stable LC3B-deficient cells were created by transfection with lentiviral particles containing LC3B specific shRNA. Thyroid cancer cell viability, proliferation, migration and apoptosis were analyzed in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells after exposure to gamma-radiation (6 Gy). Immunostaining with anti-LC3B was performed on tissue samples from 10 patients with anaplastic (ATCs) and 10 patients with papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs). LC3B expression was decreased in cell lines that derived from metastatic lesions (by 70% in FTC236 and by 90% in FTC238) as compared to FTC133 cells. Transfection with lentiviral particles inhibited LC3B mRNA level by 80% in FTC133 cells. LC3B silencing had no effect on cell cycle, did not inhibit thyroid cancer cells migration, and did not induce apoptosis. Glucose deprivation led to phosphorylation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells. Induction of LC3BII and loss of p62 protein were detected in LC3B-expressing but not in LC3B-deficient cells. gamma-radiation induced gH2AX and caspase 3 cleavage in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells. However, recovery of thyroid cancer cells after irradiation was more efficient in LC3B-deficient cells. Colony forming assay showed that survival fraction after gamma-radiation was higher in LC3B-deficient cells compared to LC3B-expressing cells (p = 0.01). Granular cytoplasmic staining with anti-LC3B was detected in 5/10 (50%) differentiated PTCs, but in 0/10 (0%) ATCs. LC3B is involved in thyroid cancer cell resistance to metabolic and oxidative stressors. Decreased LC3B expression in undifferentiated thyroid cancer suggests that defective autophagy can contribute to thyroid cancer cell resistance to therapy.",Excluded,0.9220468
472,"Radioprotective properties of detoxified lipid A from Salmonella minnesota R595 In the past, the toxicity of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or its principal bioactive component, lipid A, has detracted from their potential use as radioprotectants. Recently, a relatively nontoxic monophosphoryl Lipid A (LAM) that retains many of the immunobiologic properties of LPS has been isolated from a polysaccharide deficient Re mutant strain of Salmonella minnesota (R595). The ability of the native endotoxic glycolipid (GL) from S. minnesota (R595) as well as diphosphoryl lipid A (LAD) and nontoxic monophosphoryl lipid A (LAM) derived from GL to protect LPS responsive (CD2F1 or C3H/HeN) and nonresponsive (C3H/HeJ) mice from 60Co gamma irradiation has been studied. Administration of GL, LAD, or LAM to CD2F1 or C3H/HeN mice (400 micrograms/kg) 24 h prior to exposure provided significant radioprotection. No protection was afforded to C3H/HeJ mice. Experiments were also conducted to determine the relative abilities of GL, LAD, and LAM to stimulate hematopoiesis as reflected by the endogenous spleen colony (E-CFU) assay. Protection was not correlated with the ability of these substances to increase E-CFUs or to induce colony-stimulating activity (CSA).",Excluded,0.9220328
1054,"X-ray-induced sterility in Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) and male longevity following irradiation The mosquito Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1895) is a potent vector of several arboviral diseases, most notably chikungunya and dengue fever. In the context of the sterile insect technique (SIT), the sterilization of the male mosquitoes before their release can be achieved by gamma-ray irradiation. As gamma-ray irradiators are becoming increasingly problematic to purchase and transport, the suitability of an X-ray irradiator as an alternative for the sterilization of Ae. albopictus males was studied. The sterilization of up to 200,000 pupae at one time can be achieved with relative ease, and the sterility results obtained were comparable with those achieved by gamma irradiation, where 99% sterility is induced with a dose of 40 Gy. A significant reduction of longevity was observed in the latter stages of the males' life after irradiation treatments, especially at doses > 40 Gy, which is consistent with the negative effects on longevity induced by similar radiation doses using gamma rays. Females irradiated at 40 Gy were not only 100% sterile, but also failed to oviposit entirely, i.e., all of the females laid 0 eggs. Overall, it was found that the X-ray irradiator is generally suitable for the sterilization process for sterile insect technique programs, as it showed a high processing capacity, practicality, high effectiveness, and reproducibility.",Excluded,0.9219587

A total of 236 persons participated, belonging to 10 different professional groups and working at two Swedish power plants. Job-related radiation risks were judged about average as compared to a number of other risks. On the whole, the participants in the study were satisfied with the measures of safety at work, but there were some exceptions to this rule, especially among those hired for temporary jobs through external contractors. The experience of job-related radiation risks was related to the level of knowledge about radiation and its risks: those who knew less experienced larger risks. General level of anxiety did not correlate with risk perception. The latter was accounted for mainly by perceived radiation risks. Job satisfaction was more strongly related to perceived conventional job risks than to nuclear risks. Risk ratings were related to how subjects defined the concept of risk. Those who stressed consequences as part of their risk definition gave higher risk ratings.",Excluded,0.9218077

Tubal dysfunction prior to irradiation in these patients was due to functional impairment. However, tubal dysfunction after irradiation was due to both organic obstruction and functional impairment. Organic obstruction of the tube was found to be severe with higher dosages of irradiation (to 80 Gy) resulting in subsequent otitis media.

716,"Site-specific cancer incidence and mortality after cerebral angiography with radioactive thorotrast Few opportunities exist to evaluate the carcinogenic effects of long-term internal exposure to alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides. Patients injected with Thorotrast (thorium-232) during radiographic procedures, beginning in the 1930s, provide one such valuable opportunity. We evaluated site-specific cancer incidence and mortality among an international cohort of 3,042 patients injected during cerebral angiography with either Thorotrast (n = 1,650) or a nonradioactive agent (n = 1,392) and who survived 2 or more years. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for Thorotrast and comparison patients (Denmark and Sweden) were estimated and relative risks (RR), adjusted for population, age and sex, were generated with multivariate statistical modeling. For U.S. patients, comparable procedures were used to estimate standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and RR, representing the first evaluation of long-term, site-specific cancer mortality in this group. Compared with nonexposed patients, significantly increased risks in Thorotrast patients were observed for all incident cancers combined (RR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.9-4.1, n = 480, Denmark and Sweden) and for cancer mortality (RR = 4.0, 95% CI 2.5-6.7, n = 114, U.S.). Approximately 335 incident cancers were above expectation, with large excesses seen for cancers of the liver, bile ducts and gallbladder (55% or 185 excess cancers) and leukemias other than CLL (8% or 26 excess cancers). The RR of all incident cancers increased with time since angiography (P < 0.001) and was threefold at 40 or more years; significant excesses (SIR = 4.0) persisted for 50 years. Increasing cumulative dose of radiation was associated with an increasing risk of all incident cancers taken together and with cancers of the liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum and other digestive sites; similar findings were observed for U.S. cancer mortality. A marginally significant dose response was observed for the incidence of pancreas cancer (P = 0.05) but not for lung cancer. Our study confirms the relationship between Thorotrast and increased cancer incidence at sites of Thorotrast deposition and suggests a possible association with pancreas cancer. After injection with >20 ml Thorotrast, the cumulative excess risk of cancer incidence remained elevated for up to 50 years and approached 97%. Caution is needed in interpreting the excess risks observed for site-specific cancers, however, because of the potential bias associated with the selection of cohort participants, noncomparability with respect to the internal or external comparison groups, and confounding by indication. Nonetheless, the substantial risks associated with liver cancer and leukemia indicate that unique and prolonged exposure to alpha-particle-emitting Thorotrast increased carcinogenic risks.",Excluded,0.9211144

The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a potential alternative tool for the management of this pest, however, only conflicting data is found regarding the optimal dose to achieve sterility. Thus, this study evaluated the effect of gamma radiation doses (0, 40, 50, 60 and 70 Gy) on male and female reproductive sterility, gonads morphometry, emergence, flight ability, and longevity under nutritional stress of A. fraterculus. Full female sterility was achieved at 50 Gy, while full male sterility was achieved at 70 Gy. Both ovarian and testicular sizes were affected by irradiation, while no influence was observed on the quality parameters evaluated. Our results suggest that 70 Gy applied 48 h before adult emergence can be used to sterilize A. fraterculus in a SIT programme.",Excluded,0.9208972
237,"Detrimental effects of electron beam irradiation on the cowpea bruchid Callosobruchus maculatus BACKGROUND: Electron beam (eBeam) irradiation technology is an environmentally friendly, chemical-free alternative for disinfesting insect pests of stored grains. The underlying hypothesis is that specific doses of eBeam will have defined detrimental effects on the different life stages. We evaluated the effects of eBeam exposure in a range of doses (0.03-0.12 kGy) on the development of the cowpea bruchid (Callosobruchus maculatus) at various stages of its life cycle., RESULTS: Differential radiosensitivity was detected during egg development. Early and intermediate stages of eggs never hatched after exposure to a dose of 0.03 kGy, whereas a substantial portion of black-headed (i.e. late) eggs survived irradiation even at 0.12 kGy. However, further development of the hatched larvae was inhibited. Although midgut protein digestion remained intact, irradiated larvae (0.06 kGy or higher) failed to develop into normal living adults; rather, they died as pupae or abnormally eclosed adults, suggesting a detrimental effect of eBeam on metamorphosis. Emerged irradiated pupae had shorter longevity and were unable to produce any eggs at 0.06 kGy or higher. At this dose range, eggs laid by irradiated adults were not viable. eBeam treatment shortened adult longevity in a dose-dependent manner. Reciprocal crosses indicated that females were more sensitive to eBeam exposure than their male counterparts. Dissection of the female reproductive system revealed that eBeam treatment prevented formation of oocytes., CONCLUSION: eBeam irradiation has very defined effects on cowpea bruchid development and reproduction. A dose of 0.06 kGy could successfully impede cowpea burchid population expansion. This information can be exploited for post-harvest insect control of stored grains.

345,"Investigation of awareness levels about the radiation safety of personnel working in the imaging units of the hospitals in Agri, Turkey Radiation treatments, which are frequent and hidden hazards in imaging centers in hospitals, seriously affect employee health. In general, people think that there will be nothing to them because they do not know the damage of the radiation. It is not possible to stay away from radiation in some professions. For example, the radiology officials, their job is to identify the disease in people with radiographic method has no chance of dealing with radiation. That's why we need to do our job by getting enough information about radiation and its hazards, and by protecting ourselves and our environment from the dangers of radiation. Therefore, our study aimed to determine the level of information about employee safety of the health personnel working in public and private hospitals in Agri city centrum. Data was collected through a questionnaire by answering the questions of the personnel under observation in the imaging centers of hospitals.

548,"Seven cases of radiation-induced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma We report 7 cases of radiation-induced skin cancer. The diagnosis was based on the history of radiotherapy for benign skin diseases (5 cases) and of occupational exposures to medical doctors (2 cases). All cases were squamous cell carcinomas which arose from chronic radiodermatitis. The estimated latent period of these tumors ranged from 6 to 64 years, with an average of 29.9 years. After surgical treatments of the lesions, no local recurrences were observed in all cases. Benign skin diseases had sometimes been treated with low-energy radiation before the 1960s. Considering the estimated latent period, the peak time point of developing risk of radiation-induced skin cancer by such treatment has been already passed, however, the danger of it should not be ignored in future. In association with multiplicity of radiation usage, occupational exposure of radiation may develop the risk of occurrence of skin cancer in future. Therefore, we should recognize that radiation-induced skin cancer is not in the past. In the cases of chronic skin diseases showing warty keratotic growth, erosion and ulcer, we should include chronic radio-dermatitis in the differential diagnosis. It is necessary to recall all patients about the history of radiotherapy or radiation exposure.

938,"Host and tumor immunity: Local and systemic opportunities to enhance tumor curability by radiotherapy Success of radiation treatment depends on intrinsic properties of tumor cells, involvement of the host immune system and the crosstalk between tumor and host cells in primary and secondary (metastatic) sites. During the last decade our laboratory has investigated the role of these interactions in the ability of radiotherapy to eradicate primary tumors and metastatic disease. In the current presentation we will focus on host factors which interact with ionizing radiation (IR). The results of our studies using genetic models and specific immunological probes have identified CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, professional antigen presenting cells (CD11c+ dendritic cells), local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and host Type I Interferons (IFNs) as required for successful treatment by radiation 1,2. Transformation of the tumor microenvironment into an ""immunological hub"" to suppress local and distant disease is a tantalizing goal for which radiotherapy might be well suited, especially in combination with immunotherapy. , Our group has recently demonstrated that the combination of radiotherapy and anti-PD-L1 antibodies decrease accumulation and function of myeloid derived suppressor cells(CD11b,Gr1+) through enhanced local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs). in experimental systems3,4 The capacity of local radiotherapy to augment the activation TILs and drive cytokine production is, in part, due to the ability to increase tumor antigen cross-presentation by professional antigen presenting cells in the tumor stroma. Our group demonstrated host type I IFNs are essential for enhanced tumor antigen cross-presentation following radiotherapy. The critical role of type I IFNs in the host immune response to radiotherapy positions them as central components in the crosstalk between tumor cells and the host that can exert positive or negative influences depending on the context. In particular, the interaction of tumor cells with the host leads to the selection of clones resistant to the cytotoxic effects of IFNs and radiotherapy. Using transcriptomic approaches we identified a set of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) associated with tumor radioresistance.5 This gene set was identified in different types of primary tumors (lung, prostate, breast and glioblastoma) and termed the Interferon Related DNA Damage Signature (IRDS). Statistical training of this gene set detected a 7 gene signature which predicted response to adjuvant radio/chemotherapy for some woman with breast cancer 6. The IRDS is prognostic for patients with subsets of glioma and prostate cancer. We propose that these data indicate the presence of pro-survival genes in the IFN/Jak/Stat axis, which has been confirmed recently through a genomics approach The Jak-Stat pathway is currently under investigation as a potential therapeutic target for radio-chemosensitization in different tumor types. Our current approaches are directed towards identification of tumor ISGs with pro-survival/radioprotective functions.

Blood flow parameters 1 cm below the bifurcation of the common carotid artery (mean velocity time averaged, lumen diameter, resistivity index-RI) as well as perivascular reaction, were recorded on Color Doppler Imaging video tapes in a series of five consecutive examinations up to six months postirradiation. There were no statistically significant changes shown between the initial and follow-up examinations for any of the parameters investigated. There was no difference in blood flow between the ipsilateral (operated-irradiated) and contralateral side of the neck. Results did not seem to correlate with known vascular disease risk factors such as sex, arterial pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking and diabetes. After the effect of age was controlled, flow measurements remained statistically stable. Radiation dosage did not appear to influence carotid flow parameters. Perivascular reaction had the highest peak immediately postirradiation but regressed with time.

63,"Assessment of effect of partial sterility on mating performance in sweetpotato weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) The sterile insect technique (SIT) is widely used to suppress or eradicate target pest insect populations. Although the effectiveness of SIT depends on the ability of released sterile males to mate with and inseminate wild females, the use of gamma radiation to induce sterility negatively impacts reproductive cells as well as somatic cells. Consequently, sterilization by irradiation drastically diminishes mating performance over time. In the current study, we evaluated the effect of irradiation dose intensity on fertility, mating propensity, and mating competitiveness in sweetpotato weevil, Cylas formicarius elegantulus (Summers) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), for 16 d after irradiation. Although the mating propensity of males irradiated with 200 Gy, the dose currently used to induce complete sterility of C. f. elegantulus in the SIT program in Okinawa Prefecture, was equal to that of nonirradiated weevils for the first 6 d, the mating propensity of males irradiated with doses between of 75 and 150 Gy was maintained for the first 12 d. The potential fertilization ability of weevils was highly depressed compared with the control weevils, even in those treated with 75 Gy. Mating performance was severely compromised in weevils that were irradiated with a dose of 100 Gy or more. These results demonstrate that partial sterilization can be highly advantageous in eradication programs for the sweetpotato weevil.

The immunogenicity of irradiated blood parasites for intact cattle and splenectomised calves Intraerythrocytic forms of B. bovis were exposed to 350 Grays (Gy) gamma irradiation and were then injected intravenously into intact two and three year old Hereford steers. One of 15 steers died on initial infection and subsequently six steers were given a virulent heterologous challenge three weeks after recovery; all six animals were highly immune. The remaining eight animals were kept under quarantine conditions for 10 months and were then challenged with a different virulent heterologous strain of B. bovis. Seven of eight were highly immune, but one animal died. Subsequently a further 12 steers were injected intravenously with 1 X 10(8) irradiated organisms. All showed only mild transient clinical signs. After 12 months quarantine in a tick-free area these animals were then challenged with a virulent heterologous strain and all 12 were shown to be highly immune. Irradiation reduced the infective dose from 1 X 10(8) to 2.5 X 10(3) parasites. These parasites multiplied at the same rate, and achieved the same maximum parasitaemia as the parent non-irradiated strain, but the disease produced by them was not severe.

The AIM of this study was to investigate the biological radiation effect on the basis of a characteristic radiation parameter., PATIENTS, METHODS: After RSO procedures with yttrium-90 citrate colloid and subsequent immobilisation of the knee, blood specimens of 10 patients were collected immediately before RSO and 11 to 13 days after the intervention. The yield of dicentric chromosomes in the lymphocytes was determined exclusively in metaphases of the first cell cycle in vitro. In addition, activity leakage was measured by wholebody bremsstrahlung-scintigraphy., RESULTS: No statistically significant increase in the number of dicentric chromosomes (26 before treatment and 34 after treatment) in 20 192 cells analyzed from the 20 blood samples could be found as a result of RSO. However, the analysis of at least 1000 cells per blood sample demonstrates a tendency for a biological radiation effect in the blood of patients on the basis of this characteristic radiation parameter. Two of the 10 RSO patients had undergone a second RSO using yttrium-90 citrate, whereby one patient displayed activity transport out of the knee joint, amounting to 6 MBq. Only for him a radiation effect (about 130 mGy per single RSO) could be calculated by biological dosimetry., CONCLUSION: Since in general, based on the analysis of dicentric chromosomes in at least 1000 lymphocytes per individual, detection limits for groups of persons after long-term exposures to low-LET radiation of 50-100 mGy are possible, we assume that RSO with yttrium-90 should be associated with a low whole-body radiation exposure.",Excluded,0.91938245

Design(s): Retrospective chart review. Setting(s): Academic teaching hospital (referral center). Patient(s): All patients with diagnosed thyroid cancer who had been exposed to radiation before surgical treatment were retrospectively identified from the thyroid cancer database at our institution (1963-2007). One hundred twenty-five patients (95 women and 30 men) were included. Inclusion criteria included surgical treatment for thyroid cancer and a history of exposure to radiation at least 3 years before diagnosis of the disease. Main Outcome Measure(s): Pathologic features and data related to disease recurrence, distant metastasis, and survival. Result(s): Mean (range) age at first exposure to radiation was 19.4 (1-65) years, and mean lag time to diagnosis of disease was 28.7 (3-60) years. Patients were treated surgically with either total or near-total thyroidectomy (83%) or partial or subtotal thyroidectomy (17%). Pathologic diagnoses included 111 papillary carcinomas (89%). Sixty- three percent of patients had multifocal disease, 12% had lymphovascular tumor invasion, and 26% had direct ex- trathyroid extension of disease. Twenty-five percent of patients had metastases to cervical lymph nodes, and 9% had distant metastases. Sixteen percent of patients experienced local recurrence of disease. At last follow-up, 86% of patients were alive and free of disease, 8% were alive with disease, 4% had died of thyroid cancer, and 2% had died of an unrelated cause. Compared with other patients with thyroid cancer, this radiation-exposed cohort was more likely to undergo total thyroidectomy, multiple operative procedures, and external radiotherapy. A higher percentage had multifocal disease, extrathyroid extension, stage IV disease, and distant metastases. At follow-up, fewer patients were free of disease, and more patients had died of thyroid disease.

1035,"RAD18 mediates resistance to ionizing radiation in human glioma cells Radioresistance remains a major challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). RAD18 a central regulator of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), has been shown to play an important role in regulating genomic stability and DNA damage response. In the present study, we investigate the relationship between RAD18 and resistance to ionizing radiation (IR) and examined the expression levels of RAD18 in primary and recurrent GBM specimens. Our results showed that RAD18 is an important mediator of the IR-induced resistance in GBM. The expression level of RAD18 in glioma cells correlates with their resistance to IR. Ectopic expression of RAD18 in RAD18-low A172 glioma cells confers significant resistance to IR treatment. Conversely, depletion of endogenous RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells sensitized these cells to IR treatment. Moreover, RAD18 overexpression confers resistance to IR-mediated apoptosis in RAD18-low A172 glioma cells, whereas cells deficient in RAD18 exhibit increased apoptosis induced by IR. Furthermore, knockdown of RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells disrupts HR-mediated repair, resulting in increased accumulation of DSB. In addition, clinical data indicated that RAD18 was significantly higher in recurrent GBM samples that were exposed to IR compared with the corresponding primary GBM samples. Collectively, our findings reveal that RAD18 may serve as a key mediator of the IR response and may function as a potential target for circumventing IR resistance in human GBM.

This study was carried out to identify possible impacts of fallout by atomic bomb tests or by the Chernobyl event on SSR in Italy. Italy is a country without commercial nuclear power generation for the last four decades and thus nearly free of radiological confounders. Counts of annual male and female live births in Italy are provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by the Italian Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT). This study included 57.7 million live births (1940-2019) with overall SSR 1.05829. The Italian SSR trend was modelled with linear and non-linear logistic regression. Trend changes, i.e., periods with level shifts were estimated with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Two distinct idealized level shifts were identified superimposed on a uniform secular downward trend. The first one is seen towards the end of the 1960s with a jump sex odds ratio (SOR) 1.00681, p < 0.0001. The second one occurred in 1987 with SOR 1.00474, p < 0.0001. In each of the 3 periods separated by the two jumps, SSR uniformly decreased with trend SOR per 100 years of 0.98549, p < 0.0001. In conclusion, the secular trend in the Italian SSR showed two marked level shifts, at the end of the 1960s and from 1987 onward. These follow the release of radioactivity by atmospheric atomic bomb tests during the 1960s and by Chernobyl in 1986 and corroborate the hypothesis that ionizing radiation increases SSR.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.9184206

Compared to the level of 24 or less Bq/m3, the adjusted odds ratios of lung cancer associated with radon levels of 25-49, 50-99 and 100 or more Bq/m3, were 1.13 (95% confidence interval; 0.29-4.40), 1.23 (0.16-9.39) and 0.25 (0.03-2.33), respectively. None of the estimates showed statistical significance, due to small sample size. When the subjects were limited to only include residents of more than 30 years, the estimates did not change substantially. This study did not find that the risk pattern of lung cancer, possibly associated with residential radon exposure, in Misasa Town differed from patterns observed in other countries.",Excluded,0.9182201
988,"Determinants of model of renarrowing after beta radiation for in-stent restenosis UNLABELLED: It is unknown whether model of renarrowing after beta-radiation for in-stent restenosis (ISR) is influenced by the type of geographic miss (GM)., METHODS: In 166 ISR treated with Galileo, serial quantitative coronary angiographic analysis was done. Minimal lumen diameters and lengths were measured for (1) stent, (2) peri-stent subsegments subjected to angioplasty with/without irradiation, and (3) irradiation margins. GM was defined as: (Type 1) edge injury within the 32P source dose fall-off: 2.0 mm inside and outside the source end marker or (Type 2) overt, nonirradiated injury: beyond the outer 2.0-mm long dose fall-off zone., RESULTS: Restenosis rate was 28.3% at 8.9+/-4.5 months with 60% located exclusively outside the stent. Type 1 GM was present in 24.7% of proximal edges, whereas Type 2 in 18.1%. Respective percentages for distal edges were 23.5% and 15.7%. Regardless of presence and type of GM, significant late lumen loss occurred only outside the stent. However, the biggest late lumen loss at the proximal edge was induced by the Type 1 GM (0.65+/-0.79, p<0.001), while proximal Type 2 GM was not associated with edge renarrowing (-0.04+/-0.48, p=NS). Both reference lumen diameter and proximal Type 1 GM influenced restenosis independently (OR 0.47; 95%CI 0.24-0.90; p=0.023 and OR 2.46; 95%CI 1.12-5.40; p=0.025)., CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of presence and type of geographic miss, late lumen loss after beta-radiation occurs only outside the stent. However, injury within the proximal 32P dose fall-off but not overt edge injury is associated with the biggest late lumen loss at the respective edge, triggering recurrent restenosis.",Excluded,0.91820914
965,"Failure of cardioxane (ICRF-187, dexrazoxane) to limit peroxidative heart damage in rats after gamma irradiation or farmorubicin (4'- epidoxorubicin) treatment The ability of Cardioxane to protect against the peroxidative type of heart damage induced by a single treatment with farmorubicin (10 mg/kg ip) or ionizing radiation (20 Gy gamma rays) as well was investigated in WAG strain rats. Cardioxane in doses 20 mg/kg was applied ip 1 h before and 20 h after farmorubicin treatment or 30 min before and 20 h after irradiation. The early markers of peroxidative damage were thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS) in serum and heart homogenate, and the cytoplasmic enzyme creatine kinase CK (CPK) activity in serum. Results indicate that Cardioxane in clinically relevant doses did not exert a protective effect against oxidative reactions and did not significantly influence the changes of serum enzyme level observed after both cardiotoxic agents. Furthermore, Cardioxane alone induced a small but significant increase of TBA-RS in serum and heart tissue, providing additional toxicity.",Excluded,0.91818047
372,"A Small Peptide Ac-SDKP Inhibits Radiation-Induced Cardiomyopathy BACKGROUND: Advances in radiotherapy for thoracic cancers have resulted in improvement of survival. However, radiation exposure to the heart can induce cardiotoxicity. No therapy is currently available to inhibit these untoward effects. We examined whether a small tetrapeptide, N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (Ac-SDKP), can counteract radiation-induced cardiotoxicity by inhibiting macrophage-dependent inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. METHODS AND RESULTS: After characterizing a rat model of cardiac irradiation with magnetic resonance imaging protocols, we examined the effects of Ac-SDKP in radiation-induced cardiomyopathy. We treated rats with Ac-SDKP for 18 weeks. We then compared myocardial contractile function and extracellular matrix by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and the extent of inflammation, fibrosis, and Mac-2 (galectin-3) release by tissue analyses. Because Mac-2 is a crucial macrophage-derived mediator of fibrosis, we performed studies to determine Mac-2 synthesis by macrophages in response to radiation, and change in profibrotic responses by Mac-2 gene depleted cardiac fibroblasts after radiation. Cardiac irradiation diminished myocardial contractile velocities and enhanced extracellular matrix deposition. This was accompanied by macrophage infiltration, fibrosis, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and cardiac Mac-2 expression. Ac-SDKP strongly inhibited these detrimental effects. Ac-SDKP migrated into the perinuclear cytoplasm of the macrophages and inhibited radiation-induced Mac-2 release. Cardiac fibroblasts lacking the Mac-2 gene showed reduced transforming growth factor beta1, collagen I, and collagen III expression after radiation exposure. CONCLUSION(S): Our study identifies novel cardioprotective effects of Ac-SDKP in a model of cardiac irradiation. These protective effects are exerted by inhibiting inflammation, fibrosis, and reducing macrophage activation. This study shows a therapeutic potential of this endogenously released peptide to counteract radiation-induced cardiomyopathy.",Excluded,0.91810983

Several published prognostic gene expression signatures were evaluated within this set. These consisted of different radiotherapy relevant signatures (i.e. for hypoxia, proliferation and 'stemness'). Signatures were correlated with various endpoints that have been determined in the ten different xenograft models. These include immunohistochemical measures for hypoxia and proliferation, volume doubling time (VDT) and local tumour control after fractionated irradiation or after single dose irradiation under clamp hypoxia., RESULTS: We found several significant correlations between the published gene expression signatures and tumour parameters. Several signatures, like the proliferation and wound signature correlated with BrdU labelling index. Further a 'stemness'-related gene signature showed a strong negative correlation with hypoxic fraction., CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous assessment of immunohistochemistry, in vivo tumour properties and gene expression profiling in a comprehensive set of xenograft models can be used to validate and potentially infer biological information about prognostic gene signatures.",Excluded,0.91730845
955,"Pre-apoptotic response to therapeutic DNA damage involves protein modulation of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3 in acute myeloid leukemia cells BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are characterized by non-mutated TP53, high levels of Hdm2, and frequent mutation of the Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase. The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis., RESULTS: Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis., CONCLUSION: Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients.",Excluded,0.91722244

437,"Lhermitte's sign following head and neck radiotherapy Lhermitte's sign is an uncommon sequel of radiotherapy to the cervical spinal cord. Although the exact mechanism underlying its occurrence remains unclear; it is felt to be the result of a temporary interference with the turnover and synthesis of myelin, leading to focal demyelination. We have undertaken a detailed analysis of the radiation delivered to four patients who developed the sign after irradiation for malignancies of the head and neck. Our data support the view that radiation dose is crucial to its development, but calculations using the linear-quadratic radiobiological model raise interesting questions regarding the dose-response relationship. In particular, we find that calculations of biologically effective doses are predictive of a late rather than an early normal tissue response. The onset of symptoms after irradiation was apparent in all four patients within 4 months, with resolution in all being complete within a further 6 months: The recognition of this benign transient form of radiation-induced paraesthesia and its differentiation from the later onset, progressive and unremitting symptoms associated with radiation myelopathy is essential in reassuring patients undergoing head and neck irradiation.",Excluded,0.91700554
735,"Post-Fukushima radiation education for Japanese high school students in affected areas and its positive effects on their radiation literacy In post-Fukushima Japan, radiation education is very important, and the subject is being actively discussed. However, little information is available about the amount of knowledge students initially had about radiation or about how well radiation education improves their understanding. Using the questionnaire results of 717 students completed before and after radiation lectures held in three high schools in Fukushima, we examined the number of answers to the questionnaire aligned with the evidence base, and classified the students into clusters based on radiation-related behavior and attitudes to assess the effectiveness of the lecture. The contents of the lectures consisted of (i) scientific knowledge relating to radiation, (ii) results of radiation examinations conducted locally following the disaster and (iii) measures and precautions for daily radiation protection. Associations between the type of knowledge and radiation-related behavior and attitude were also examined to determine which type of knowledge was more important for deepening students' understanding of radiation. This study revealed that radiation education in high schools was effective for students with respect to acquiring relevant basic and practical knowledge; however, the effects of the radiation lecture differed greatly between schools, presumably due to differences in the delivery and atmosphere of the lecture. The present study also suggested that radiation education may positively transform student attitudes and behaviors related to radiation.

TaqMan Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) was used to verify the SNPs of LIG4 and HSPB1 genes. Chi-square criterion was used to compare the differences in demographic characteristics, exposure to risk factors, and SNPs genotypes. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated by logistic regression analysis.

456,"Phosphorylation of Ser312 contributes to tumor suppression by p53 in vivo The tumor suppressor p53 is a master sensor of stress, and posttranslational modifications are key in controlling its stability and transcriptional activities. p53 can be phosphorylated on at least 23 Ser/Thr residues, the majority of which are phosphorylated by stress-related kinases. An exception is Ser315 in human p53 (Ser312 in mouse), which is predominantly phosphorylated by cell cyclerelated kinases. To understand the biological importance of Ser312 phosphorylation in vivo, wegenerated p53Ser312Ala knock-in mice. We show here that, although Ser312 is not essential for mouse life span under normal physiological conditions, Ser312Ala mutation dampens p53's activity during embryonic development. This is evident from its partial rescue of embryonic lethality caused by Mdm4 deletion. In agreement with the notion that Ser312 mutation weakens p53 function, Ser312Ala mice are alsomore susceptible to tumorigenesis following a sublethal ionizing radiation dose. Importantly, in the cohort studied, Ser312 mutation predisposes mice to develop thymic lymphomas and liver tumors, partly due to p53Ser312Ala's inability to fully induce a set of p53 target genes including p21 and cyclin G1. Thus, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser312 is required for p53 to function fully as a tumor suppressor in vivo.",Excluded,0.9158055

We examined the effect of chemical exposures on cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers at the AREVA NC Pierrelatte facility. Method(s): A cohort of 2,897 uranium processing workers employed for at least 6 months was followed from 1968 through 2006. Exposure to uranium and potentially carcinogenic chemicals was assessed with a plant-specific job-exposure matrix. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for cancers of the lung, lymphohematopoietic system, kidney and bladder, brain and central nervous system (BCNS), and prostate were estimated for each specific chemical exposure, with Cox regression models stratified for sex and calendar period and adjusted for socioeconomic status. Additional adjustments enabled us to examine the effect of co-exposure to uranium and other chemicals. Result(s): Exposure to aromatic solvents was associated with increased risk of BCNS malignancies after adjustment for other chemicals (HR=6.53, 95% CI=1.14-37.41; n=6) and for other chemicals and uranium (HR=7.26, 95% CI=0.90-58.19) in the annual exposure status model. Selected groups of lymphohematopoietic cancers were found associated with solvent exposure. Inconclusive results were found regarding chromium (VI) exposure, since only 2 workers died from lung cancer among 109 exposed.

Spleen colony number, size and type, 59Fe uptake, and microscopic study of splenic structure were used as means of assessment. The most severe or least repaired damage was induced by high dose irradiation (4000 r), by 1000 r followed immediately by splenic ligation, and by two successive splenic ligations separated by a 30 day recovery period. It was seen that reduction of CFUs lodgment, as measured by f factor, played a very major role in the lesser number of spleen colonies formed after either kind of damage. Following the several treatments, the numbers of spleen colonies formed, their size and their typing as erythrocytic or granulocytic varied independently of each other, suggesting that these functions of the microenvironment, and the cell types responsible for them, are independent of each other.

However, in the field of oral squamous cell carcinoma, evaluation of host immune response on the basis of proliferative activity of tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TIL) has not been reported. Therefore, we applied double immunohistochemical staining of proliferation markers Ki-67 and CD8 to surgically resected and paraffin-embedded tissue sections for 35 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma. With this method, there was a significant correlation between the percentage of Ki-67+CD8+TIL and the intra-tumor epithelium infiltration rate of CD8+TIL (P=0.0237). In the process of analysis, we found that the proliferative activity of CD8+TIL tended to correlate (P=0.0859) with clinical N factor (lymph node metastasis), which was previously reported to suppress host immune response. We therefore assumed there was another factor inducing host immune response. The proliferative activity of CD8+TIL was well correlated with preoperative radiotherapy (P=0.0200) while there was no significant correlation between the proliferative activity of CD8+TIL and other clinical factors; age, tumor size, clinical stage, pathological N factor (P=0.5410, 0.7769, 0.1041, and 0.1072, respectively).

The distributions of annual and cumulative occupational doses were described by using summary statistics. Results Between 1992 and 2015, the median annual personal dose equivalent per nuclear medicine technologist was 2.18 mSv (interquartile range [IQR], 1.25-3.47 mSv; mean, 2.69 mSv). Median annual personal dose equivalents remained relatively constant over this period (range, 1.40-3.30 mSv), while maximum values generally increased over time (from 8.00 mSv in 1992 to 13.9 mSv in 2015).

These SNPs are local tagging markers for causal gene alterations. Consideration of candidate genes in the tagged regions would be facilitated by additional information on the particular pathomechanisms which contribute to the observed risk increase. In this study we test for an association of prostate cancer tagging SNPs with alterations in DNA repair capacity, a phenotype that is frequently involved in cancer predisposition. DNA repair capacity was assessed on blood lymphocytes from 128 healthy probands after ionizing irradiation. We used the micronucleus (MN) assay to determine the cellular DNA double-strand break repair capacity and flow cytometry to measure damage induced mitotic delay (MD). Probands were genotyped for a panel of 14 SNPs, each representing an independent prostate cancer risk locus previously identified by GWAS. Associations between germline variants and DNA repair capacity were found for the SNPs rs1512268 (8p21), rs6983267 (8q24) and rs10993994 (10q11). The most significant finding was an association of homozygous rs10993994 T-allele carriers with a lower MN frequency (. p=. 0.0003) and also a decreased MD index (. p=. 0.0353). Cells with prostate cancer risk alleles at rs10993994 seem to cope more efficiently with DNA double strand breaks (less MN) in a shorter time (decreased MD index). This intriguing finding imposes concern about the accuracy of repair, with respect to the cancer risk that is mediated by T genotypes. To date, . MSMB (microseminoprotein beta) is favored as the causal gene at the 10q11 risk locus, since it was the first candidate gene known to be expressionally altered by rs10993994.

The sources of Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) in the organism are the respiratory processes occurring in cells catalyzed by different enzymes. Operation of ROS is balanced by antioxidants, the compounds; although present in low concentrations, they significantly inhibit the degree of oxidation of particular molecules. The Aim of the Study. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in the integrated antioxidant system under the influence of radon therapy in osteoarthritis patients. Material and Methods. Observation included 35 patients suffering from degenerative joints and disc disease (mean age 56.5 years) undergoing radon water therapy and control group that consisted of 15 osteoarthritis patients (mean age 54.2) without contact with radon water. Before therapy and after 18 days of treatment, serum total antioxidant status (TAS) was assessed with the use of standard colorimetric assay. Results. In the study group, we observed trends to increase TAS concentration, whereas, in the control group, TAS concentration was decreasing. Conclusions.

In this preliminary study, the content of 210Pb in the skeleton is used to obtain a measure of integrated exposure to the lungs of people living in homes with above average concentrations of radon. Measurements of skeletal 210Pb made in vivo allow the exposed individuals to become, in effect, their own 'samplers' and 'dosimeters' through the normal physical and physiological processes of inhalation, deposition, and retention. 210Pb measurements have been made on 40 subjects whose homes have above average levels of radon.

Cytogenetic analysis was applied to eight patients, all treated for the same tumour localisation; the same localisation was used to prevent the variability usually observed between patients treated with radiotherapy and to allow the corresponding roles of the size of irradiation field and of the dose rate to be studied. The yield of dicentrics, centric rings and fragments was measured in blood samples taken before treatment, during the course of radiotherapy and up to 6 months after. After the first fraction of radiotherapy, we observed that the whole-body dose estimated from the yield of dicentrics and rings was higher (0.35+/-0.2 Gy) than the calculated equivalent whole-body dose (0.07+/-0.04 Gy). By contrast, the partial-body dose derived from the Qdr (quotient of dicentrics and rings) model was estimated to be 2.2+/-0.3 Gy, which agreed quite well with the dose delivered to the tumour (2.1+/-0.1 Gy). We also found a correlation between the yield of induced chromosome aberrations and the target field size (p = 0.014). U-value analysis showed that the distribution of dicentrics and rings was overdispersed, despite the fractionation of the exposure, and a positive correlation between the U-value and the dose rate was observed (p = 0.017).

410,"Therapeutic action of radioprotector indometofen The experiments on mice and dogs have shown the effectiveness of indomethofene administration after total acute radiation exposure. Introduction of indomethofene at doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg during time from 30 min to 3 days after irradiation resulted in reliable increase of mice survivability, 40-60% on average. Mice survival rate after single peroral introduction of indomethofene radioprotective doses was comparable with that resulting from referencing preparation estrofeme, which is estradiol oral dosage from (under the assumption that in contrast to indometafene estrofeme was introduced repeatedly every other day from 3 till 21 day after irradiation). Therapeutic action of indomethofene was confirmed in the experiments on dogs. After radiation exposure at a dose which caused the death of all dogs of control group, survival rate of experimental animals which received single oral dosage form of indomethofene at radioprotective dose in 1 and 3 days after irradiation was 40%. This study showed that indomethofene--long-acting radioprotector--is effective as therapeutic agent for acute radiation damage treatment.",Excluded,0.911776
1033,"A novel aldehyde dehydrogenase-3 activator (Alda-89) protects submandibular gland function from irradiation without accelerating tumor growth Purpose: To determine the effect of Alda-89 (an ALDH3 activitor) on (i) the function of irradiated (radiotherapy) submandibular gland (SMG) in mice, (ii) its toxicity profile, and (iii) its effect on the growth of head and neck cancer (HNC) in vitro and in vivo. Experimental Design: Adult mice were infused with Alda-89 or vehicle before, during, and after radiotherapy. Saliva secretion was monitored weekly. Hematology, metabolic profile, and postmortem evaluation for toxicity were examined at the time of sacrifice. Alda-89 or vehicle was applied toHNCcell lines in vitro, and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice transplanted with HNC in vivo with or without radiation; HNC growth was monitored. The ALDH3A1 and ALDH3A2 protein expression was evaluated in 89 patients with HNC and correlated to freedom from relapse (FFR) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Alda-89 infusion significantly resulted in more whole saliva production and a higher percentage of preserved acini after radiotherapy compared with vehicle control. There was no difference in the complete blood count, metabolic profile, and major organ morphology between the Alda-89 and vehicle groups. Compared with vehicle control, Alda-89 treatment neither accelerated HNC cell proliferation in vitro, nor did it affect tumor growth in vivo with or without radiotherapy. Higher expression of ALDH3A1 orALDH3A2 was not significantly associated with worse FFR or OS in either human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive or HPV-negative group. Conclusion(s): Alda-89 preserves salivary function after radiotherapy without affecting HNC growth or causing measurable toxicity in mice. It is a promising candidate to mitigate radiotherapy-related xerostomia. © 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.",Excluded,0.91099226

Methods and Materials: Neuropsychological testing (IQ, attention [modified Trail- Making Test A, Digit Symbol Test, D2 Test, Wiener Determination Machine]) was used to examine 40 patients (43 +/- 10 years) before and immediately after the first fraction (1.2 Gy) of hyperfractionated total body irradiation (TBI) at the University of Heidelberg. The patients received antiemetic premedication. Test results are given as mean percentiles +/- standard deviation, with 50 +/- 34 being normal. Thirty-eight control patients (53 +/- 15 years) were studied to quantify the influence of hospitalization, stress, and repeated testing. Result(s): The patients showed normal baseline test results (IQ = 101 +/- 14, attention = 54 +/- 28) and no decrease in test results after 1.2 Gy TBI. Attention functions improved (66 +/- 25) corresponding to a practice effect of repeated testing that was seen in the control group, although alternate versions of the tests were used (IQ = 104 +/- 10, attention before = 42 +/- 29, attention after = 52 +/- 31).

120,"Residential radon and lung cancer in Sweden: risk analysis accounting for random error in the exposure assessment A large epidemiologic study on residential radon exposure and lung cancer has been conducted in Sweden. An attempt is now made to quantify the impact of random error in the exposure assessment on the risk estimate for lung cancer in this study. The study included 1,360 lung cancer cases, diagnosed from 1980 to 1984, and 2,847 population controls. Radon measurements were performed in 8,992 dwellings occupied by the study subjects some time since 1947. Questionnaires provided information on smoking and other risk factors. Imprecision in the retrospective exposure assessment for radon was estimated from a Monte Carlo technique modeling Swedish conditions. Adjusted risk estimates were obtained from regression analyses based on expected values for true time-weighted average residential radon concentration (TWA), conditional on observed TWA. Without adjustment for random error in the TWA estimates, the linear excess relative risk coefficient was 0.10 per 100 Bq m(-3), but an excess relative risk of about 0.15 to 0.20 per 100 Bq m(-3) was suggested following adjustment. The potentially significant consequences of errors in the retrospective radon exposure assessment should be taken into consideration in the risk estimation as well as in comparisons of results of different studies and in future pooled analyses.",Excluded,0.90926737

354,"Combination Therapy with Radiation and PARP Inhibition Enhances Responsiveness to Anti-PD-1 Therapy in Colorectal Tumor Models PURPOSE: The majority of colorectal cancers are resistant to cancer immune checkpoint inhibitors. Ionizing radiation (IR) and several radiosensitizers, including PARP inhibitors, can enhance responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors by potentially complementary mechanisms of action. We assessed the ability of radiation and PARP inhibition to induce proimmunogenic changes in tumor cells and enhance their in vivo responsiveness to anti-PD-1 antibodies., METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a candidate drug screen and used flow cytometry to assess effects of the PARP inhibitor veliparib on IR-mediated changes in MHC-1 antigen presentation and surface localization of immune-modulating proteins including PD-L1 and calreticulin in colorectal cancer tumor models. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the effects of veliparib and radiation on the expression of proinflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines. The ability of concurrent PARP inhibition and subablative doses of radiation therapy to enhance in vivo responsiveness to anti-PD-1 antibodies was assessed using unilateral flank-tumor models with or without T-cell depletion., RESULTS: Veliparib was a potent radiosensitizer in both cell lines. Radiation increased surface localization of MHC-1 and PD-L1 in a dose-dependent manner, and veliparib pretreatment significantly enhanced these effects with high (8 Gy) but not with lower radiation doses. Enhancement of MHC-1 and PD-L1 surface localization by IR and IR+ veliparib remained significant 1, 3, and 7 days after treatment. IR significantly increased delayed tumoral expression of proinflammatory cytokines interferon-Y and CXCL10 but had no significant effect on the expression of IL-6 or TGF-beta. Concurrent administration of veliparib and subablative radiation therapy (8 Gy x 2) significantly prolonged anti-PD-1-mediated in vivo tumor growth delay and survival in both tumor models. Moreover, these effects were more pronounced in the microsatellite instability-mutated MC38 tumor model. Enhancement of anti-PD-1 mediated tumor growth delay with veliparib and IR was attenuated by CD8+ T-cell depletion., CONCLUSIONS: We provide preclinical evidence for a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance responsiveness of colorectal tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Survey data were linked with radiation dosimetry, a cancer registry, and health insurance data by personal identification numbers. A nationwide representative survey was also conducted using a stratified random sampling design with face-to-face interviews., RESULTS: A total of 12,387 radiologic technologists were enrolled, which accounted for approximately 63% of all diagnostic radiologic technologists working in South Korea. For nationwide survey, 585 workers were interviewed using the detailed questionnaire, and buccal cells were also collected by scraping the inside of the cheek. The majority of study subjects were under 50-year-old and male workers. The average annual effective dose of radiation declined both men (from 2.75 to 1.43 mSv) and women (from 1.34 to 0.95 mSv) over the period of 1996-2011. A total of 99 cancers (66 cancers in men and 33 in women) were reported from 1992 to 2010. The standardized incidence ratio of all cancer combined was significantly lower in men (SIR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96) than general population, but the ratios for thyroid cancer were significantly higher than expected among both men and women., CONCLUSIONS: This cohort provides comprehensive information on work activities and health status of diagnostic radiologic technologists.

The subjects were 115 Balb/c mice 4 weeks of age. The animals were divided into group A (control), group B (DMH), group C (DMH+MW), and group D [DMH + 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)]. Radiation (10 mW/cm2) was delivered dorsally with the E field parallel to the mouse's long body axis in an anechoic chamber. Radiations were administered 3 hr daily, 6 days per week, over a period of 5 months. The average SAR was estimated to be 10-12 W/kg. During the course of radiation treatments, DMH was injected once per week. The tumor promoter TPA was administered once per week for 10 weeks, from the third week on, after the initial treatment. The incidence of tumors did not significantly differ between the three test groups (groups B, C, and D; P > 0.25). However, the number of tumors, the size of the tumors, and the incidence of protuberant and infiltrative types in tumor-bearing animals were higher in group D compared to groups B and C (P < 0.05). No difference was found between groups B and C (P > 0.25). The study indicates that 2.45 GHz microwave radiation at 10 mW/cm2 power density did not promote DMH-induced colon cancers in young mice.

97,"Incidental gonadal radiation exposure in the prophylactic treatment of heterotopic ossification Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy is commonly used for heterotopic ossification (HO) prophylaxis after the orthopedic repair of fractures involving the hip and femur. Given the young age of many of these patients presenting for treatment and the proximity of the reproductive organs to tissue requiring radiation therapy, incidental radiation exposure to the gonads must be considered for potential fertility issues. The purpose of this study was to report dosimetric gonadal exposure among a large cohort of patients who underwent 3-dimensional simulation and radiation therapy for HO prophylaxis. Materials/Methods: A total of 45 patients (38 males; 7 females) were identified that underwent volumetric CT-planned radiation therapy for HO prophylaxis using a single fraction dose of 700 cGy. The median age was 22 years (range, 12 - 55 years). Treatment plans were generated with the Pinnacle3 treatment planning system (Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Milpitas, CA) with heterogeneity corrections accounted for via convolution/superposition dose calculation algorithm. Treatments were delivered post-operatively within 48 hours using opposed AP/PA fields that generally included the surgical prosthesis as well as the femoral head, ischial ramus, and greater/lesser trochanters. Three male patients received bilateral radiation for fractures involving both hips. The simulation CT scans were retrieved from archives, and the testicles and ovaries were delineated as paired structures on 3 millimeter axial sections so that dose-volume characteristics could be determined. Result(s): The proportion of male patients receiving ipsilateral testicular doses (maximum) greater than 15 cGy, 50 cGy, and 100 cGy was 63%, 24%, and 21%, respectively. Another 20% of male patients had both testicles exposed to maximum doses greater than 15 cGy, the number commonly cited to cause sperm abnormalities. The 3 men undergoing bilateral radiation received an average maximal testicular dose of 422 cGy (range, 187 - 686 cGy). Among female patients, 86% received maximal ipsilateral ovarian doses over 15 cGy. One of the seven women received a dose exceeding 15 cGy to both ovaries (778 cGy and 31.5 cGy). Conclusion(s): Gonadal doses exceeding historically recommended tolerances can result in patients undergoing radiation for HO prophylaxis. Scrotal shields, informing patients about possible fertility issues, and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as an alternative to radiation therapy should be considered as appropriate in the management of this benign condition.",Excluded,0.9048629
518,"Cumulative radiation dose from medical imaging procedures in patients undergoing resection for lung cancer Background: Radiation dose from diagnostic imaging procedures is not monitored in patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer. Evidence suggests an increased lifetime risk of malignancy of 1.0% per 100 millisieverts (mSv). As such, recommendations are to restrict healthcare and radiation workers to a maximum dose of 50 mSv per year or to 100 mSv over a three-year period. The purpose of this study was to estimate cumulative effective doses of radiation in patients undergoing lung cancer resection and to determine predictors of increased exposure. Method(s): We identified 94 consecutive patients undergoing resection for non-small cell lung cancer. Radiologic procedures performed from one year prior to resection until two years postresection were recorded. Estimates of effective doses (mSv) were obtained from published literature and institutional records. Predictors of dose greater than 50 mSv per year and greater than 100 mSv per three years were examined statistically. Result(s): The majority of patients (median age = 67 years) had stage IA cancer (52%). In the three-year period, patients had 1,958 radiologic studies (20.8/patient) including 398 computed tomographic (CT) scans (4.23/patient) and 211 positron emission tomography (PET) scans (2.24 per patient). The three-year median estimated radiation dose was 84.0 mSv (interquartile range, 44.1 to 123.2 mSv). The highest dose was in the preoperative year. In any one year, 66% of patients received more than 50 mSv, while 19% received over 100 mSv. Over the three-year period, 43.6% of patients exceeded 100 mSv. The majority of the radiation (89.8%) was from CT or PET scans. On multivariate analysis, a history of previous malignancy (odds ratio [OR] 3.8; confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 12.7), postoperative complications (OR 6.16; CI 1.42 to 26.6), and postoperative surveillance with PET-CT (OR 13.2; CI 4.34 to 40.3) predicted exposure greater than 100 mSv over the three-year period. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that lung cancer patients often receive a higher dose of radiation than that considered safe for healthcare and radiation workers. The median cumulative dose reported in this study could potentially increase the individual estimated lifetime cancer risk by as much as 0.8%.

Both of these modalities have unique physical properties that could be exploited for an improved therapeutic effect. While pre-clinical studies report promising normal tissue sparing phenomena, systematic toxicity data are still required. Our objective was to characterise the toxicity of SBBR and MRT and to calculate equivalent doses of conventional radiation therapy (CRT). A dose-escalation study was performed on C57BLJ/6 mice using total body and partial body irradiations. Dose-response curves and TD50 values were subsequently calculated using PROBIT analysis. For SBBR at dose-rates of 37 to 41 Gy/s, we found no evidence of a normal tissue sparing effect relative to CRT. Our findings also show that the MRT valley dose, rather than the peak dose, best correlates with CRT doses for acute toxicity. Importantly, longer-term weight tracking of irradiated animals revealed more pronounced growth impairment following MRT compared to both SBBR and CRT. Overall, this study provides the first in vivo dose-equivalence data between MRT, SBBR and CRT and presents systematic toxicity data for a range of organs that can be used as a reference point for future pre-clinical work.",Excluded,0.9027663
1144,"DNA double strand breaks but not interstrand crosslinks prevent progress through meiosis in fully grown mouse oocytes There is some interest in how mammalian oocytes respond to different types of DNA damage because of the increasing expectation of fertility preservation in women undergoing chemotherapy. Double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation and agents such as neocarzinostatin (NCS), and interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by alkylating agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), are toxic DNA lesions that need to be repaired for cell survival. Here we examined the effects of NCS and MMC treatment on oocytes collected from antral follicles in mice, because potentially such oocytes are readily collected from ovaries and do not need to be in vitro grown to achieve meiotic competency. We found that oocytes were sensitive to NCS, such that this ionizing radiation mimetic blocked meiosis I and caused fragmented DNA. In contrast, MMC had no impact on the completion of either meiosis I or II, even at extremely high doses. However, oocytes treated with MMC did show gamma-H2AX foci and following their in vitro maturation and parthenogenetic activation the development of the subsequent embryos was severely compromised. Addition of MMC to 1-cell embryos caused a similarly poor level of development, demonstrating oocytes have eventual sensitivity to this ICL-inducing agent but this does not occur during their meiotic division. In oocytes, the association of Fanconi Anemia protein, FANCD2, with sites of ICL lesions was not apparent until entry into the embryonic cell cycle. In conclusion, meiotic maturation of oocytes is sensitive to DSBs but not ICLs. The ability of oocytes to tolerate severe ICL damage and yet complete meiosis, means that this type of DNA lesion goes unrepaired in oocytes but impacts on subsequent embryo quality.",Excluded,0.90258646

For each municipality we estimated the median radon concentration and the relative risk (RR) for esophageal cancer mortality for males and females. The relative risk was calculated using a Bayesian approach. Homes with data on radon concentration were selected through stratified random sampling. To be included, each municipality had to have at least five radon measurements.

This study aims to determine radiation dose received by relatives who care for non self-supporting I-131 patients at Siriraj Hospital. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty caregivers of 20 patients underwent I-131 therapy for thyroid cancer with a standard protocol were given specific instructions with regard to radiation safety and provided with electronic digital dosimeter to continuously measure radiation dose received on daily basis, three days in the hospital. On the day patient is released, thyroid uptake estimates were performed to assess internal radiation dose received by caregivers. Result(s): The 3-day accumulative doses to caregivers to patients receiving 150 mCi (n = 11) and 200 mCi (n = 9) of I-131 ranged from 37 to 333 muSv and 176 to 1,920 muSv respectively depending on the level of supports required. Thyroid uptake estimates in all caregivers were undetectable. Dosimeter indicated a maximum whole-body dose of 1.92 mSv was more than the public dose limit of 1 mSv but within the dose constraint of 5 mSv for caregivers. Discussion(s): Radiation dose to caregivers of a non self-supporting hospitalized patient undergoing I-131 therapy were well below the limits recommended by the ICRP. The patients can be comforted with confidence that dose to caregivers will be less than the limit. Conclusion(s): This study provides guidance for medical practitioners to obtain practical radiation safety concerns associated with hospitalized patients receiving I-131 therapy especially when patient needs assistance.Copyright © 2016, Medical Association of Thailand.

Pacemaker implantations were further divided into single-chamber (2.5 Gy cm2) and dual chamber (3.5 Gy cm2) procedures and implantations of cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (18 Gy cm2). Results show that relatively new techniques such as TAVI and treatment of chronic total occlusion (CTO) often produce relatively high doses, and thus emphasises the need for use of an optimization tool such as DRL to assist in reducing patient exposure.

Following treatment, the patients became steroid-dependent and pursued a gradual downhill course with increasing obtundation. Although there was no improvement in the length or quality of survival of these patients, neuropathological studies in the 13 patients who came to autopsy showed the following: 1) extensive coagulative necrosis of much of the tumor mass; 2) dense infiltration by collagenous connective tissue; 3) minimal phagocytic reaction; 4) marked reduction in the amount of viable tumor; 5) abnormal astrocytic proliferation, which may represent either astrocytoma or a radiation-induced bizarre gliosis, and 6) areas of gliosis and white matter degeneration in the brain stem, remote form the tumor site. These observations suggest that continued efforts to further refine this mode of therapy for glioblastoma are warranted.",Excluded,0.8972993
1069,"Taste dysfunction in patients receiving radiotherapy BACKGROUND: Taste loss is a major cause of morbidity in patients undergoing head and neck irradiation., METHODS: In a prospective study, 51 patients undergoing radical head and neck irradiation at the Tokyo University Hospital were assessed for taste loss. Taste ability was measured by the taste threshold for the four basic tastes (sweet, sour, salt, and bitter qualities) plus another taste of ""umami"" quality using a filter-paper-disc method in patients before, during, and after radiotherapy (RT)., RESULTS: All tastes declined on the fifth week after the start of RT and improved on the 11th week. Anatomic pathologic analyses in rats revealed that taste buds diminished completely on the sixth day after irradiation of 15 Gy in a single fraction, and the appearance of taste buds returned almost to the preirradiation state on the 28th day., CONCLUSIONS: The main cause of taste disorder resulting from RT was believed to be a disappearance of taste buds and not damage to the taste nerves.",Excluded,0.8967212
1147,"Ionizing Radiation Exposure in Patients with COVID-19: More than Needed OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the ionizing radiation exposure in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study in which all patients presented with suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 were included. The study was carried out in a university-affiliated private hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Biological radiation dose exposure (cumulative effective dose: CED) was evaluated in millisievert (mSv) units. RESULT(S): A total of 1410 patients were included in the study. Of all study subjects, 804 patients (57%) underwent only one chest computed tomography (CT) procedure. Six hundred and six patients (43%) had two or more chest CT procedures. Median CED was 6.02 (min-max:1.67-16.27) mSv. The number of patients who were exposed to <= 5 mSv were 149 (24.6%), whereas 457 patients (75.4%) were exposed to >5 mSv. CONCLUSION(S): The radiation exposure in COVID-19 patients seems unjustifiably high. Awareness should be increased as to the proper use of chest CT in COVID-19 as per to the society recommendations.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.

316,"Determinants of radiation dose during right transradial access: Insights from the RAD-MATRIX study BACKGROUND: The RAD-MATRIX trial reported a large operator radiation exposure variability in right radial percutaneous coronary procedures. The reasons of these differences are not well understood. Our aim was to appraise the determinants of operator radiation exposure during coronary right transradial procedures., METHODS: Patient arrangement during transradial intervention was investigated across operators involved in the RAD-MATRIX trial. Operator radiation exposure was analyzed according to the position of the patient right arm (close or far from the body) and in relation to the size of the upper leaded glass., RESULTS: Among the 14 operators who agreed to participate, there was a greater than 10-fold difference in radiation dose at thorax level (from 21.5 to 267 muSv) that persisted after normalization by dose-area product (from 0.35 to 3.5 muSv/Gy*cm2). Among the operators who positioned the instrumented right arm far from the body (110.4 muSv, interquartile range 71.5-146.5 muSv), thorax dose was greater than that in those who placed the instrumented arm close to the right leg (46.1 muSv, 31.3-56.8 muSv, P = .02). This difference persisted after normalization by dose-area product (P = .028). The use of a smaller full glass shield was also associated with a higher radiation exposure compared with a larger composite shield (147.5 and 60 muSv, respectively, P = .016)., CONCLUSIONS: In the context of the biggest radiation study conducted in patients undergoing transradial catheterization, the instrumented right arm arrangement close to the leg and greater upper leaded shield dimensions were associated with a lower operator radiation exposure. Our findings emphasize the importance of implementing simple preventive measures to mitigate the extra risks of radiation exposure with right radial as compared with femoral access.

1039,"Radiation exposure to staff in intensive care unit with portable CT scanner Background. Bedside radiological procedures pose a risk of radiation exposure to ICU staff. The perception of risk may increase the degree of caution among the health care staff and raise new barriers preventing patients from obtaining prompt care. Objective. The aim of this study was to estimate the annual cumulative radiation dose to individual ICU staff. Methods. In this prospective study, forty subjects were required to wear thermoluminescent dosimeter badges during their working hours. The badges were analyzed to determine the exposure after 3 months. Results. A total of 802 radiological procedures were completed at bedside during the study period. The estimated annual dosage to doctors and nurses on average was 0.99 mSv and 0.88 mSv (p < 0.001), respectively. Residents were subjected to the highest radiation exposure (1.04 mSv per year, p = 0.002). The radiation dose was correlated with day shift working hours (r = 0.426; p = 0.006) and length of service (r = - 0.403; p < 0.01). Conclusions. With standard precautions, bedside radiological procedures - including portable CT scans - do not expose ICU staff to high dose of ionizing radiation. The level of radiation exposure is related to the daytime working hours and length of service.Copyright © 2016 Zhichao Xie et al.",Excluded,0.8947045
987,"TRAIL enhances efficacy of radiotherapy in a p53 mutant, Bcl-2 overexpressing lymphoid malignancy Background and purpose: Resistance to apoptosis is a contributing factor in the response to radiotherapy. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether TRAIL - in a soluble isoleucine zippered form - enhances the cytotoxic effect of irradiation on tumour cells with a blockade in the mitochondrial apoptosis route and/or a dysfunctional p53 pathway. Material(s) and Method(s): The p53 mutant human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia line Jurkat transduced with the Bcl-2 gene was used as model system in vitro and in a subcutaneous transplant setting in immunodeficient mice. Sensitivity to single and combined treatment was read out by apoptosis hallmarks and clonogenic survival in vitro, and by bioluminescence and palpation in vivo. Result(s): Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 did not undergo apoptosis after irradiation, but the combination with TRAIL synergistically induced apoptosis without breaking mitochondrial resistance. TRAIL also reduced clonogenic survival after irradiation. In vivo, radiotherapy or TRAIL alone delayed tumour outgrowth, but combination treatment had the most profound effect. Conclusion(s): Isoleucine zippered TRAIL can strongly enhance the efficacy of tumour therapy with ionising radiation in an unfavourable setting of p53 mutation and Bcl-2 overexpression. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Recent and dedicated studies comparing directly these procedures in term of patient radiation exposure are lacking. Our aim was to compare radiation exposure among different interventional procedures performed under fluoroscopic guidance. Methods The RODEO study (NCT: 02972736) is an international observational retrospective multicenter study enrolling all patients undergoing diagnostic or interventional procedures performed by different interventional operators (i.e. radiologists, interventional cardiologists or electrophysiologists) in 6 centers, without exclusion criteria. The primary end-point of the study was the comparison of dose area product (DAP) among interventional cardiology, electrophysiology or interventional radiology procedures. Results A total of 17,711 procedures were included in the study: 13,522 interventional cardiology, 2352 electrophysiology and 1864 interventional radiology procedures. The highest DAP values were observed for interventional radiology procedures (74 Gy * cm2 [Interquartile range 27-178 Gy * cm2]), followed by interventional cardiology (40 Gy * cm2 [22-78 Gy * cm2]) and electrophysiology procedures (13 Gy * cm2 [4-44 Gy * cm2], p < 0.0001). In term of specific procedures, the highest DAP values were observed in structural or valvular cardiac procedures (134 Gy * cm2 [51-260 Gy * cm2]) whereas the lowest DAP values in pacemaker insertion (11 Gy * cm2 [4-28 Gy * cm2]). Conclusion In this large multicenter study, the highest radiation exposure was observed in procedures performed by interventional radiologists. However, among specific procedures, structural or valvular cardiac procedures were associated with the highest radiation exposure.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.89196944
361,"Radiation exposure among patients with the highest CT scan utilization in the emergency department The risk of cancer from computed tomography (CT) scan radiation is a rising concern in the medical field. Our objectives were to determine how many patients received more than ten CT scans in an academic emergency department (ED) over the course of 7 years and to quantify their radiation exposure and lifetime attributable risk of cancer. An electronic chart review was performed at our urban academic institution with an annual census of 110,000 patients. All patients who underwent a CT scan performed during ED management between the dates of January 2001 and December 2007 were identified. Specific predetermined data elements (e.g., subject demographics, type of CT scan) were extracted by two researchers blinded to hypothesis, using a preformatted data form. After identifying patients with more than ten CTs performed during the study period, radiation exposure was calculated based on accepted and reported radiation doses for the respective anatomic CTs, and lifetime attributable cancer risk was calculated based on the seventh report of the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR VII) projections. Over the 7-year study period, 24,393 patients received 34,671 CT scans. The vast majority of patients (17,909) received a single CT. Twenty-six (0.1 %) patients received more than ten CTs totaling 374 scans with an average radiation exposure of 83.4 mSv. The maximum lifetime attributable risk for any individual in this cohort was 1.7 % above the baseline cancer risk. Among those undergoing CT imaging in our ED, high-exposure patients (greater than ten scans) constituted a significant minority, while more than one in four patients underwent more than one CT scan during the study period. While the presumed overall risk of radiation-induced cancer continues to be low, it is important for the emergency physician to use clinical knowledge as well as concern for the patient when utilizing radiographic imaging. Increasing attributable cancer risk may have important public health implications in the future, regardless of the low individual risk.",Excluded,0.8911653

The radiobiological response of the mammary glands renders it possible to prevent hormone induced gynecomastia by means of radiotherapy. On this indication, 121 patients treated with female sex hormones between 1961 and 1972 for carcinoma of the prostate were subjected to irradiation of both mammary glands. On 4 successive days, daily doses of 300 r surface dose were administered to each mammary gland, corresponding to a focal dose of 840 r at 3 cm tissue depth. The parameters were: roentgen radiation, 150 kV, 20 mA, 0.5 mm Cu, focus skin distance 40 cm, field size 6 x 6 m. 84 patients could be followed up more than 6 mth after the treatment. In 67 cases (79.8%), development of gynecomastia was completely suppressed, while in 16 cases, a slight degree of gynecomastia had occurred in spite of the irradiation. In one case, the gynecomastia that had already been completely developed at the time of the radiotherapy, had remained uninfluenced apart from a mitigation of the sensation of tension. In 6 of the patients who were free from gynecomastia (8.9%) the hormone treatment had been started prior to the radiotherapy. This proportion was considerably larger among the patients with mild gynecomastia, viz. 75% (12 cases). The lesser effect of the radiotherapy is considered to be correlated with the duration and dosage of the hormone treatment started prior to the radiotherapy, and may also be correlated with the duration of the interval between the end of the hormone treatment and the start of the irradiation.",Excluded,0.89097714

1038,"PHD3-dependent hydroxylation of HCLK2 promotes the DNA damage response The DNA damage response (DDR) is a complex regulatory network that is critical for maintaining genome integrity. Posttranslational modifications are widely used to ensure strict spatiotemporal control of signal flow, but how the DDR responds to environmental cues, such as changes in ambient oxygen tension, remains poorly understood. We found that an essential component of the ATR/CHK1 signaling pathway, the human homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans biological clock protein CLK-2 (HCLK2), associated with and was hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 3 (PHD3). HCLK2 hydroxylation was necessary for its interaction with ATR and the subsequent activation of ATR/CHK1/p53. Inhibiting PHD3, either with the pan-hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) or through hypoxia, prevented activation of the ATR/CHK1/p53 pathway and decreased apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Consistent with these observations, we found that mice lacking PHD3 were resistant to the effects of ionizing radiation and had decreased thymic apoptosis, a biomarker of genomic integrity. Our identification of HCLK2 as a substrate of PHD3 reveals the mechanism through which hypoxia inhibits the DDR, suggesting hydroxylation of HCLK2 is a potential therapeutic target for regulating the ATR/CHK1/p53 pathway.",Excluded,0.8894081

In head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, long-term treatment-related complications include radiotherapy (RT)-induced carotid vasculopathy and stroke. The current study investigated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of the carotid wall in long-term HNC survivors treated with RT.Methods. MRI of the carotid arteries was performed within a prospective cohort of 42 HNC patients on average 7 years after RT. Two independent radiologists assessed maximal vessel wall thickness of common and internal carotid arteries. In case of wall thickening (>= 2 mm) the MRI signals as well as length of the thickened segment were assessed.Results. Mean (SD) age of the 42 patients at baseline was 53 (13) years and mean (SD) follow-up time after RT was 6.8 (1.3) years. In total 62% were men and 60% had one or more cerebrovascular risk factors. Mean (SD) dose of RT on the common carotid arteries and internal carotid arteries was 57 Gy (11) and 61 Gy (10), respectively. Wall thickening was observed in 58% of irradiated versus 27% of non-irradiated common carotid arteries and 24% of irradiated versus 6% of non-irradiated internal carotid arteries (p < 0.05). Mean (SD) thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated common carotid arteries was 2.5 (0.9) and 2 (0.7) mm (p = 0.02). Mean thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated internal carotid arteries was 1.8 (0.8) and 1.5 mm (0.3) (n.s.).

All the patients examined were maintained within 4 weeks on a diet, radioprotective effect of which was realized due to the elevated content of sulfur containing amino acids, antioxidants and complexes. In the patients who lived in the radionuclide-contaminated areas, a moderate activation of lipid peroxidation was detected simultaneously with marked alterations in the humoral component of the immunity system, which involved a considerable increase in the levels of IgG and complements C3 and C4. A decrease in content of malonic dialdehyde and diene conjugates as well as normalization of IgG and decrease in content of IgA, IgM and C3 were observed in blood plasma of the patients on diet. Supplementation of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega 3-PUFA), 5 g/day and alpha-tocopherol, 12.5 mg/day, to the diet elevated the serum concentrations of all lg classes, which suggests the presence of an immunomodulating effect of omega 3-PUFA. Moreover, the content of malonic dialdehyde was not increased in blood plasma if 3-PUFA was used. Hence, increased alpha-tocopherol levels should be used in the treatment of these patients with omega 3-PUFA (up to 5-7 mg per g PUFA) in order to stabilize lipid peroxidation.",Excluded,0.8838702
906,"Relationship of Th17/treg cells and radiation pneumonia in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma Background/Aim: Radiation pneumonia is a main side-effect that has limited the clinical usage of radiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma. T helper cells 17 (Th 17) and T regulatory cells (Tregs) play an important role in inflammatory diseases. The balance between Treg and Th17 cells is a key factor in the progression of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Whether Tregs and Th17 cells are predictive factors of radiation pneumonia has not yet been reported. In this study, we investigated the relationships of Treg/Th17 cells and radiation pneumonia in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: One hundred and forty-eight patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received radical and palliative radiotherapy were enrolled. The levels of Th17 and Treg cells in the blood of patients were detected using flow cytometry at the time point of pre-radiotherapy, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th week from the start of radiation and 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Radiation pneumonia was evaluated according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group's acute radiation pneumonia standards, with the endpoint being grade 2 or above radiation pneumonia. Result(s): There were 24 cases of radiation pneumonia in 148 cases of locally advanced esophageal cancer patients who underwent radiotherapy. Th17 cells increased and, in contrast, Treg cells decreased in the radiation pneumonia group. The change in the ratio of Th17/Treg was more pronounced and the difference was statistically significant from the 5th week after irradiation compared to patients with no radiation pneumonia (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in dosimetric parameters, including V5, V20, V30 and mean lung dose (MLD) and clinical factors, such as gender, age, smoking history, history of surgery and chemotherapy.

Methodology and Preliminary Results of the SMALL CELL Study INTRODUCTION: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive histologic type of lung cancer, and accounts for approximately 10%-15% of all cases. Few studies have analyzed the effect of residential radon. Our aim is to determine the risk factors of SCLC., METHODS: We designed a multicenter, hospital-based case-control study with the participation of 11 hospitals in 4 autonomous communities., RESULTS: Results of the first 113 cases have been analyzed, 63 of which included residential radon measurements. Median age at diagnosis was 63 years; 11% of cases were younger than 50 years of age; 22% were women; 57% had extended disease; and 95% were smokers or former smokers. Median residential radon concentration was 128Bq/m3. Concentrations higher than 400Bq/m3 were found in 8% of cases. The only remarkable difference by gender was the percentage of never smokers, which was higher in women compared to men (P<.001). Radon concentration was higher in patients with stageIV disease (non-significant difference) and in individuals diagnosed at 63 years of age or older (P=.032)., CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of SCLC cases are diagnosed early and there is a predominance of disseminated disease at diagnosis. Residential radon seems to play an important role on the onset of this disease, with some cases having very high indoor radon concentrations. Copyright © 2017 SEPAR.

78,"Advanced multimodal nanoparticles delay tumor progression with clinical radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a major treatment regimen for more than 50% of cancer patients. The collateral damage induced on healthy tissues during radiation and the minimal therapeutic effect on the organ-of-interest (target) is a major clinical concern. Ultra-small, renal clearable, silica based gadolinium chelated nanoparticles (SiGdNP) provide simultaneous MR contrast and radiation dose enhancement. The high atomic number of gadolinium provides a large photoelectric cross-section for increased photon interaction, even for high-energy clinical radiation beams. Imaging and therapy functionality of SiGdNP were tested in cynomolgus monkeys and pancreatic tumor-bearing mice models, respectively. A significant improvement in tumor cell damage (double strand DNA breaks), growth suppression, and overall survival under clinical radiation therapy conditions were observed in a human pancreatic xenograft model. For the first time, safe systemic administration and systematic renal clearance was demonstrated in both tested species. These findings strongly support the translational potential of SiGdNP for MR-guided radiation therapy in cancer treatment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.8800348

Using quantitative image analysis, we evaluated biopsy sections stained with monoclonal antibodies. We then made comparisons, in the same volunteers, with unscheduled DNA synthesis, which is a direct marker of overall excision repair. Removal of thymine dimers was slow (half-life = 33.3 h), with high levels of lesions still present 24 h post-irradiation; some lesions were still present at 7 d. In contrast, removal of 6-4 photoproducts was rapid (half-life = 2.3 h), the decay kinetics of which correlated better with the decline in epidermal unscheduled DNA synthesis (half-life = 7.1 h). These data show that as in mouse, monkey, and in vitro models, the 6-4 photolesion is repaired preferentially in human epidermis in situ. They also raise the possibility that poor thymine dimer repair may be a feature of skin types I and II, who are more prone to skin cancer than are types III and IV. There was an inverse relationship between the onset of erythema and 6-4 photoproduct repair, suggesting that this repair process initiates erythema.",Excluded,0.87568784

We quantitatively assessed the gustatory function of patients with head and neck cancers who underwent radiotherapy using recently developed standardised tools for measuring taste. Method(s): Twenty patients undergoing head and neck irradiation responded to a specific questionnaire and were assessed by olfactory and gustatory function tests. To assess changes over time, testing was performed before, immediately after, and at 2- and 4-week intervals following the start of radiotherapy. Concurrently, patients were evaluated for xerostomia from radiotherapy. Result(s): A decrease in the taste recognition threshold was observed in the second week after the beginning of radiotherapy. The taste detection threshold improved within the 14th-18th week. Most affected patients demonstrated that their gustatory function primarily decreased independent of the olfactory function. Disturbances in taste were exponentially worsened beyond an accumulated dose of 30 Gy and involved all tastants. According to a multivariate analysis, radiation-induced taste impairment was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia. However, there was an association between the dose of irradiation and the severity of taste disturbance. Conclusion(s): In this preliminary study, we found that the taste function was worse 2 weeks after the start of radiotherapy and returned to pretreatment levels within 4.5 months. Taste disturbances were exponentially worse beyond an accumulated dose of 20 Gy. Taste dysfunction after radiotherapy was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia, whereas only the dose of irradiation was associated with the severity of taste dysfunction.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded,0.8756044

1034,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of TGFbeta1 and ATM associated with radiation-induced pneumonitis: A prospective cohort study of thoracic cancer patients in China Background: We examined the effects of the rs1800469 and rs1800470 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) gene and the rs189037 and rs373759 SNPs of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene on the risk of radiation-induced pneumonitis (RP) in patients who underwent radiotherapy for various thoracic malignancies. Method(s): We determined the genotype and allele distributions of rs1800469 (C-509T), rs1800470 (C869T), rs189037 (A-111G), and rs373759 (126713 G>A) in 141 Han Chinese patients who underwent definitive thoracic radiotherapy (50 to 77 Gy, 5 days/wk) for lung cancer (small cell or non-small cell tumors, n = 97), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC, n = 27), or mediastinal cancer (n = 17). Clinical variables were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models to calculate the relative risk of RP associated with the clinical variables, and a Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the SNP genotypes and alleles and the incidence of RP for the various risk factors. Result(s): The T alleles of rs1800470 (CT/TT) and rs1800469 (CT/TT) and the G allele of rs189037 (GA/GG) were associated with the risk of >= grade-2 RP in the ESCC patients (P = 0.0006, P = 0.0127, and P = 0.0412, respectively), and that the A alleles of rs189037 (AG/AA) and rs373759 (AG/AA) were associated with the risk of >= grade-2 RP in the patients with mediastinal cancer (P = 0.0063 and P = 0.0003, respectively). None of the SNP genotypes were associated with the risk of RP in lung cancer patients. Conclusion(s): The T alleles of the rs1800470 (CT/TT) and rs1800469 (CT/TT) SNPs of TGFbeta1 and the G allele of the rs189037 (GA/GG) SNP of ATM are independent risk factors for RP in Chinese ESCC patients, and the A alleles of the rs189037 (AG/AA) and rs373759 (AG/AA) SNPs of ATM are independent risk factors for RP in Chinese patients with mediastinal cancer. These SNPs might represent useful biomarkers for personalizing radiotherapy regimens for Chinese patients with ESCC or mediastinal cancer to reduce the incidence of RP. Large-cohort studies of these SNPs in thoracic cancer patients are warranted.Copyright © 2015, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.8596668
912,"Gut microbial dysbiosis is associated with development and progression of radiation enteritis during pelvic radiotherapy Radiation enteritis (RE) is the most common complication of radiotherapy for pelvic irradiation receivers. Herein we investigated the alterations in gut microbial profiles and their association with enteritis in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. Faecal samples were collected from 18 cervical cancer patients during radiotherapy. Microbiota profiles were characterized based on 16S rRNA sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Epithelial inflammatory response was evaluated using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures. Dysbiosis was observed among patients with RE, which was characterized by significantly reduced alpha-diversity but increased beta-diversity, relative higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria and lower abundance of Bacteroides. Coprococcus was clearly enriched prior to radiotherapy in patients who later developed RE. Metastat analysis further revealed unique grade-related microbial features, such as more abundant Virgibacillus and Alcanivorax in patients with mild enteritis. Additionally, using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures, RE patient-derived microbiota induced epithelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction, enhanced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta expression compared with control microbiota. Taken together, we define the overall picture of gut microbiota in patients with RE. Our results suggest that dysbiosis of gut microbiota may contribute to development and progression of RE. Gut microbiota can offer a set of biomarkers for prediction, disease activity evaluation and treatment selection in RE. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Hormonal suppression treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues has restored spermatogenesis in irradiated rats, but similar attempts were unsuccessful in irradiated mice, monkeys, and humans. In this study, we tested a stronger hormonal suppression regimen (the GnRH antagonist, acyline, and plus flutamide) for efficacy both in restoring endogenous spermatogenesis and in enhancing colonization of transplanted stem spermatogonia in mouse testes irradiated with a total doses between 10.5 and 13.5 Gy. A 4-week hormonal suppression treatment, given immediately after irradiation, increased endogenous spermatogenic recovery 1.5-fold, and 11-week hormonal suppression produced twofold increases compared with sham-treated irradiated controls. Furthermore, 10-week hormonal suppression restored fertility from endogenous surviving spermatogonial stem cells in 90% of 10.5-Gy irradiated mice, whereas only 10% were fertile without hormonal suppression. Four-and 11-week hormonal suppression also enhanced spermatogenic development from transplanted stem spermatogonia in irradiated recipient mice, by 3.1-and 4.8-fold, respectively, compared with those not given hormonal treatment. Moreover, the 10-week hormonal suppression regimen, but not a sham treatment, restored fertility of some 13.5-Gy irradiated recipient mice from donor-derived spermatogonial stem cells. This is the first report of hormonal suppression inducing recovery of endogenous spermatogenesis and fertility in a mouse model treated with anticancer agents. The combination of spermatogonial transplantation with hormonal suppression should be investigated as a treatment to restore fertility in young men after cytotoxic cancer therapy. © The Author 2010.

The purpose of this study was to perform a prospective comparison of hand versus eye radiation exposure associated with mini-C-arm utilization and to test the hypothesis that routine mini-C-arm does not yield hand or eye dosages exceeding current recommended levels. Over a 12-month period, hand and eye radiation exposure was prospectively measured in a single board-certified hand surgeon using mini-C-arm fluoroscopy. Twenty-five cases were performed utilizing mini-C-arm fluoroscopy. Average monthly hand radiation dosage (45.81+/-14.49 mrem) was significantly higher (p = .01) than eye radiation dosage (<30 mrem). Both recorded values were below their respective critical exposure limits, as reported by the International Commission on Radiological Protection.

The esophagectomy specimens were sampled at the resection margins, the edge of irradiated length, 1 cm from the proximal and distal edge of visible tumor, the center of the tumor, and the lymph nodes., RESULTS: Radiation change in the form of fibrosis was limited to the submucosa at the resection margins, the circular muscle layer at the edge of irradiated length, and full thickness at 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Surface epithelium did not show any changes at the resection margins but did show basal cell hyperplasia at the edge of the irradiated length and ulceration at 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Endarteritis obliterans was seen only 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Necrosis, intense keratin formation, and giant cell reaction were observed at the center of the tumor. When compared with the preradiotherapy biopsies, the amount of keratin in the postradiotherapy specimens was extensive. HDRILBT may cause induction of the keratin gene in the irradiated cells to stimulate differentiation toward better differentiated cells., CONCLUSIONS: HDRILBT may cause the keratin gene in the irradiated cells to induce differentiation toward better differentiated cells.

One of the main limitations of implant-based breast reconstruction is the high rate of complications such as capsular contracture and poor aesthetic outcome, due to adjuvant radiotherapy. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) has been used to assist wound healing in the prevention and treatment of the side effects of irradiation. We aimed to investigate this effect of HBOT on the capsule reaction and skin, applied before and after irradiation, following the placement of an implant under the dorsal skin of the rat. Fifteen Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. A 18-mL smooth testicular implant was introduced into a subcutaneous pocket located on the dorsum of each rat. A single dose of 17-Gy irradiation was given to the implanted area of each rat at the third week. HBOT which lasted 3 weeks was administered to group I before irradiation, group II after irradiation. The control group did not receive HBOT. All of the rats were killed at the ninth week (6 weeks after irradiation). The dorsal skin with the capsule overlying the implant were excised for histopathological processing. The thickness of the capsule reaction of each group was evaluated statistically. Our histopathological examination revealed changes due to radiation in the control group. Many of these findings were found to be more subtle in group I and nearly absent in the group II. There was not any statistical difference between the thickness of the capsule reactions of the control group and group I, or group I and group II, but the capsular thickness of the control group was statistically higher than group II.

These systems are used industrially to heat or melt dielectric materials. Nowadays, the effects of high frequency electromagnetic (EM) fields on the health have been discussed frequently but there are few health studies done for workers around dielectric heaters and sealers. In this study, the leakage fields around dielectric heaters and sealers (27.12MHz) were measured in MKE Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation, Gazi Rocket Factory and evaluated in terms of standards. It has been observed that operators exposed to same RF fields with occupational exposure limits. Many workers have health complaints, such as elevated body temperatures in the factory. Safe distances or areas for workers should be recommended in these systems. Protective measures could be implemented to minimize these exposures. Further measurements and occupational exposure studies of RF exposed women and men are needed to demonstrate the levels of exposed Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR). Precautions should therefore be taken either to reduce the leakage fields or minimise the exposed fields. 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",Excluded,0.83000046

The 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha) levels were analyzed daily for 1 wk and thereafter at different points up to 12 wk after treatment., RESULTS: The isoprostane levels showed an increase after application of radioiodine in all investigated compartments. The effect was significantly higher and longer lasting after higher-activity therapy (2,960 or 7,400 MBq) than after lower-activity therapy (185 or 740 MBq)., CONCLUSION: These findings document a significant, dose-dependent in vivo oxidation injury as a consequence of therapeutic radioiodine application to the salivary gland.",Excluded,0.80941135
1091,"Potential Functional Variants in DNA Repair Genes Are Associated with Efficacy and Toxicity of Radiotherapy in Patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Background. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Radiotherapy, either alone or with chemotherapy, is still the primary treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are variations in how patients with NSCLC respond to radiotherapy and how toxic the therapy is. DNA repair gene polymorphisms are related to cancer development; however, their association with radiotherapy outcomes remains unknown. We hypothesized that gDNA repair gene variation could affect the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Methods. A total of 486 histologically confirmed patients with NSCLC were recruited from the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from July 2015 to September 2019. Eleven potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four DNA repair genes (XRCC1, XRCC2, XPD, and MSH2) were genotyped in these patients. A multiple factor logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between these SNPs and the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy. Results. Three SNPs, rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD), were all significantly associated with the efficacy of radiotherapy. The allele frequencies of the rs25487 CC genotype (OR = 0.457, 95% CI = 0.259-0.804, p=0.006) and the rs3218556 AG or AA genotypes (AG genotype: OR = 0.664, 95% CI = 0.442-0.999, p=0.049; AA genotype: OR = 0.380, 95% CI = 0.181-0.795, p=0.008) were both significantly higher in the response group than in the nonresponse group. For rs13181, the radiotherapy efficacy was associated with the heterozygous genotype GT (OR = 1.663, 95% CI = 1.057-2.614,p=0.027). Statistically significant associations between radiation-induced toxic reactions and rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) were also observed. The rs13181GT genotype was associated with lower toxic reactions than the TT genotype (OR = 1.680, 95% CI = 1.035-2.728,p=0.035). Conclusions. The variants rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) all contribute to the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Our findings may clarify the predictive value of DNA repair genes for prognosis in patients with NSCLC after radiotherapy. Further investigation of more genes and samples should be performed to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2020 Zhiguang Yang and Zhaoyu Liu.",Excluded,0.8074545
329,"Radiation Dose-Dependent Hippocampal Atrophy Detected With Longitudinal Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging PURPOSE: After radiation therapy (RT) to the brain, patients often experience memory impairment, which may be partially mediated by damage to the hippocampus. Hippocampal sparing in RT planning is the subject of recent and ongoing clinical trials. Calculating appropriate hippocampal dose constraints would be improved by efficient in vivo measurements of hippocampal damage. In this study we sought to determine whether brain RT was associated with dose-dependent hippocampal atrophy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Hippocampal volume was measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 52 patients who underwent fractionated, partial brain RT for primary brain tumors. Study patients had high-resolution, 3-dimensional volumetric MRI before and 1 year after RT. Images were processed using software with clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration and Conformite Europeene marking for automated measurement of hippocampal volume. Automated results were inspected visually for accuracy. Tumor and surgical changes were censored. Mean hippocampal dose was tested for correlation with hippocampal atrophy 1 year after RT. Average hippocampal volume change was also calculated for hippocampi receiving high (>40 Gy) or low (<10 Gy) mean RT dose. A multivariate analysis was conducted with linear mixed-effects modeling to evaluate other potential predictors of hippocampal volume change, including patient (random effect), age, hemisphere, sex, seizure history, and baseline volume. Statistical significance was evaluated at alpha = 0.05., RESULTS: Mean hippocampal dose was significantly correlated with hippocampal volume loss (r=-0.24, P=.03). Mean hippocampal volume was significantly reduced 1 year after high-dose RT (mean -6%, P=.009) but not after low-dose RT. In multivariate analysis, both RT dose and patient age were significant predictors of hippocampal atrophy (P<.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The hippocampus demonstrates radiation dose-dependent atrophy after treatment for brain tumors. Quantitative MRI is a noninvasive imaging technique capable of measuring radiation effects on intracranial structures. This technique could be investigated as a potential biomarker for development of reliable dose constraints for improved cognitive outcomes. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Effective skin doses were evaluated using thermoluminescent finger dosimeters (ring dosimeters). The ratios of finger dosimeter exposure were compared between the glove-protected and unprotected left hands of two surgeons and both unprotected right hands. In addition, dose-area product (DAP) and fluoroscopy times were recorded in all patients. The mean treatment-effective dose to the surgeons' hands was 0.49 +/- 0.4 mSv in the glove-protected left hand and 1.81 +/- 1.31 mSv in the unprotected left hand (p < 0.05). The mean effective hand doses were 0.59 +/- 0.55 mSv in the unprotected right hand of the glove-protected surgeon and 0.62 +/- 0.55 mSv in the unprotected right hand of the control surgeon. The total corresponding fluoroscopy time was 38.55 minutes for the protected surgeon and 41.23 minutes for the unprotected one (p > 0.05). Lead glove shielding resulted in a radiation dose reduction of 75%. The total DAP for all procedures was 256,496 mGy/cm2 and 221,408 mGy/cm2 (p > 0.05) for the protected and unprotected surgeons, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the importance of surgeons wearing lead glove protection on their leading hands during percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures and demonstrates a 75% reduction rate of exposure to radiation.",Excluded,0.8037464
1029,"'Glowing in the dark': A study of radiation received by desmoid patients undergoing multiple CT scans Aim: Patients with FAP related intra-abdominal desmoid disease undergo multiple CT scans of abdomen, pelvis, and sometimes chest to monitor the response to treatment and assess the possibility of recurrent or new tumors. CT is generally preferred to MRI because of the better quality and more easily interpretable images. However there is concern about the cumulative dose of radiation associated with multiple CT scans. This retrospective study, was performed to assess the radiation exposure of FAP desmoid patients related to CT scans Method: Patients with intra-abdominal desmoid disease related to FAP managed in our department were accessed. The number of abdominal/ pelvic and chest CTs from the time of desmoid diagnosis to the last imaging follow-up was totaled. When available, the radiation dose was obtained, when not, an average dose was applied. Patient demographics and the worst stage of the desmoid disease were noted. In this study we report only the 22 patients with more than 13 CT scans over the time of follow-up Results: There were 22 patients 7 men and 15 women, with a mean age at desmoids diagnosis of 28.4 +/- 1.0 years. Three desmoids were Stage II, 7 were stage III and 12 were stage IV. Mean follow-up was 111 months (median 107, range 34-215). The mean total number of abdominal/pelvic CT scans was 28 (median 31, range 14-42) and chest CT scans was 4.8 (median 3.5, range 0-18). The mean frequency of scans was every 4.5 months (median 3.9, range every 1 month to every 12 months). The mean cumulative dose of radiation associated with abdominal/pelvic CTs was 491 mGy*cm, equivalent to 491 mSv (0.491Sv). The highest dose in a patient with a stage IV desmoid receiving 42 CT scans over 10.5 years was 574 mSv (0.57Sv). 1 Sv is associated with a 0.055% chance of cancer. The additional dose associated with Chest CT was a mean of 265 mSv (0.26 Sv) Conclusion(s): In patients with advanced abdominal desmoid disease, the total dose of radiation accumulated over a mean of 9 years follow up is significant in terms of predisposing to cancer. This should encourage the use of alternative forms of imaging such as MRI or at least a less frequent use of CT scans.",Excluded,0.80221736

For these three cases, the mean dose to the ipsilateral transplanted lung was 10 Gy, and ipsilateral lung relative volume of lung receiving 20 Gy or more was, on average, 22%. These doses are relatively low and would have been considered safe for patients with native lungs. In our opinion, tolerance of transplanted lung to therapeutic radiotherapy clearly requires additional research. While those data are pending, radiation therapy to the thorax should not be ruled out on the basis of having a lung transplant alone, provided lung dose can be maintained as low as possible using meticulous treatment planning.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

899,"Clinical and Sialographic Imaging Features of 131I Radiation-induced Submandibular Gland Sialadenitis Purpose: 131I radiation-induced sialadenitis is the most frequent complication of 131I treatment for papillary thyroid carcinoma, but little is known about 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis. The purpose of this study was to compare and contrast the clinical and sialographic imaging features of 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis to 131I radiation-induced parotitis. Patients and Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study included patients with 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis. Clinical records and sialographic image features were evaluated. The predictor variables included age at the time of diagnosis, gender, course of the disease, site of symptoms, and sialographic image grades. The outcome variable was the location of sialadenitis. A student t-test was conducted to analyze the associations between predictor variables and the outcome. Result(s): The sample was composed of 4 patients with submandibular gland sialadenitis (100% female), 28 with parotitis (85.7% female), and 1 with submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis (P <.05). The occurrence of bilateral glands dysfunction was less often in submandibular glands (SMG: 1/4; PG: 19/28). The age and course of disease were not different between submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis (Age, SMG: 46.00 +/- 13.59 years; PG: 50.04 +/- 10.71 years, P >.05; Course of the disease, SMG: 11.00 +/- 16.69 months; PG: 6.96 +/- 11.18 months, P >.05). Radiographically, 7 of 16 patients with parotitis were identified as grade 2 and 9 patients as grade 3. In 3 patients with submandibular gland sialadenitis, 1 patient was identified as grade 2 and 2 patients as grade 3. The postoperative pathological results showed that the proliferation of glandular tissue from the hilum of the submandibular gland caused duct stenosis. Conclusion(s): The results suggest 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis has a lower incidence compared with parotitis and 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis might be related to duct stenosis caused by proliferative glandular tissue after 131I radiation treatment.Copyright © 2020 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons",Excluded,0.7637516
15,"A novel method of continuous cage-side monitoring of hyperthyroid cats treated with radio-iodine A continuous monitoring system (MGP DM2000X) was assessed for monitoring gamma radiation emissions and determining appropriate isolation times for hyperthyroid cats treated with radioactive iodine (I(131)). Daily radiation emitted by 12 cats who had received a range of doses of I(131) (80-200 MBq) was measured and average background radiation readings deducted. The effective half-lives of the I(131) in the cats were found to have a median of 2.54 days (range 1.40-3.24 days). Cats treated with 200 MBq emitted 5 microGy/day more exposure than cats treated with lower doses throughout the study period (P=0.032). All cats were found to emit a total radiation dose exposure less than 100 microGy (range 0-43 microGy) during days 18-21 of isolation. The potential additional dose exposure to owners was calculated at various days that might be considered for the cats to be returned to their owners. Using this provisional data, maximum isolation periods at this institution could be safely reduced to 17 days as long as certain precautions are followed. This preliminary study demonstrated that this novel cage-side monitoring system can be used to calculate the effective half-life of I(131) and to measure gamma radiation exposure from treated cats, which may assist other institutions in determining appropriate isolation times for individual cats.Copyright British Veterinary Association.",Excluded,0.76280636

556,"Salivary gland cancer in the United States The risk of salivary gland cancer (SGC) is increased in atomic bomb survivors and after radiotherapy, but other risk factors are not well established. Some studies have suggested an association of SGC with breast cancer and with exposure to various viruses or UVB radiation. Corroborating evidence of these associations was sought by using population-based registries to examine the demographic distribution of SGC, patterns of secondary primary cancers after SGC, and risk of SGC with AIDS. SGC incidence per 100,000 persons did not change between 1973 and 1992, averaging 1.2 in males and 0.8 in females, with a steep age gradient. To examine the relationship between UVB exposure and SGC, population-based, age-adjusted incidence rates of SGC were plotted against the UVB insolation of each registry site. Regression analysis suggested no correlation between SGC incidence and increasing UVB insolation (beta = 0.10, R2 = 0.08). SGC also did not appear to be associated with second cancers that have been linked to herpes or papilloma viruses or with AIDS [observed/expected (O/E) ratio, <2.8], but all of these conditions are so uncommon that only very large relative risks would have been statistically significant. Women with SGC before age 35 had a statistically nonsignificant elevation in breast cancer risk [O/E, 3.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.66-9.65], and older women had no increased risk of breast cancer. SGC patients were at increased risk for nonsalivary, second-primary oropharyngeal cancers (O/E, 3.27; 95% CI, 2.00-5.05), thyroid cancer (O/E, 3.31; 95% CI, 1,07-7.73), and lung cancer (O/E, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.45-2.35), particularly in patients whose SGC was treated with radiotherapy (O/E, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.06-3.80). In summary, SGC remains rare and does not appear to be associated with AIDS, virally related malignancies, or UVB. Patients who have had SGC, however, should be monitored for subsequent oropharyngeal, thyroid, and lung cancers.",Excluded,0.7610239

The analysis of radiotherapy effectiveness as a treatment modality for periarthritis humeroscapularis (PHS) Material and method. 30 patients irradiated because of PHS (1 Gy per fraction up to 6 Gy). Follow-up ranged from 1 to 216 months. The arm mobility and pain relief were assessed at the completion of radiotherapy and during follow-up examinations. Correlation between some biological factors evaluated before radiotherapy and the aforementioned endpoints was assessed using Spearman's test. Results. The mean degree of pain relief ranged from 42% to 93%. Mean improvement of arm abduction, flexion and reflexion angles ranged from 24degree to 83degree, from 47degree to 91degree and from 4degree to 13degree, respectively. The sole prognostic factor found in this study was the degree of orthopedic disability before the treatment. Small impairment at the onset correlated with significant improvement after radiotherapy.

603,"[Progressive mental deterioration after radiotherapy in adult patients with brain tumors] We report a study on changes of mental function in twenty five adult patients with cerebral low-grade gliomas after radiotherapy. None of them had shown mental deterioration before radiotherapy nor tumor recurrence after radiotherapy. Radiation was given at a dose of 48 to 78 Gy (mean: 54.2 Gy). Patients were assigned for mental functional levels according to Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) after radiotherapy. Ten patients (40%) were normal. Seven patients (28%) showed moderate disabilities and 8 (32%) severe disabilities. The median interval time from radiotherapy to the onset of mental deterioration was 2.5 years in the moderate group and 1.6 years in the severe group. CT findings in severe group demonstrated severe brain atrophy and diffuse low density in the white matter after radiotherapy. The risk factors responsible for progressive mental deterioration after radiotherapy may be radiation site and size (whole frontal lobe), total dose (over 60 Gy) and patients age at the time of radiotherapy (over 60 yrs).",Excluded,0.743716
260,"Long-term results of radiation therapy for pituitary adenoma Purpose. Local control for pituitary adenomas treated with external beam radiation therapy was retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of radiation. Materials and methods. Thirty-eight patients treated with radiation therapy between 1979 and 1994 were analyzed. The median age was 46. Nineteen newly diagnosed tumors were treated with surgery and radiation therapy, while the others were recurrent cases. Twenty-two tumors were non-functioning, while 10 produced growth hormone (GH) and three each were prolactin-, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing tumors. The median radiation dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Results. Non-functioning adenomas and prolactin-producing adenomas were completely controlled, judging from the absence of tumor progression on neuroimaging studies and clinical symptoms, and normalization of the serum prolactin level (< 25 ng/ml). On the other hand, local control was obtained in only one of the 3 patients with ACTH-producing adenomas, and the control rate at 10 years was only 46% for GH-producing adenomas. Panhypopituitarism developed in 35% of the patients after radiation therapy. No other serious complications were noted. Conclusion. Non-functioning pituitary adenomas and prolactin-producing adenomas were well controlled with external radiation therapy combined with surgery. However, dose escalation might be necessary to control GH- or ACTH-producing tumors. It is important to replace corticosteroid hormone and thyroid hormone in many patients.",Excluded,0.7376675
937,"Radiation-induced sarcoma of head and neck: 50 years of experience at a single institution in an endemic area of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in China Radiation-induced sarcoma in the head and neck (RISHN) is a rare condition whose clinical presentation and management remain difficult because of its low incidence. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the symptoms, diagnosis, and the treatment of 16,634 patients with head and neck disease, who received radiotherapy between 1960 and 2010 at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital and its predecessor, Guangxi Medical University, China. Among these patients, 16 with a first tumor of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and 1 with squamous carcinoma of the tongue met the criteria of RISHN in the head and neck. Our epidemiological data showed that the incidence of RISHN rose from 0.06 to 0.17% from 1960 to 2010; the 3-year overall survival rate was 19.1%, and 3-year diseasefree survival rate was 11.1%. The mean latency (SD) period was 93.2 (33) months. Based on the experiences at our institution, we suggest that RISHN is a rare complication after radiotherapy for head and neck tumors, especially NPC. Owing to its low incidence, it should not be a major factor affecting decisions about radiotherapy. Nevertheless, there may be a possibility of increasing incidence of RISHN after radiotherapy of NPC, as shown in our epidemiological results. Given the poor prognosis of RISHN, this possibility should be taken into serious consideration before determination of high-dose radiotherapy for patients with NPC and other head and neck tumors. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",Excluded,0.7316562

1134,"YWHAZ amplification/overexpression defines aggressive bladder cancer and contributes to chemo-/radio-resistance by suppressing caspase-mediated apoptosis The objective of this study was to characterize the oncogenic actions of a recently identified cancer-associated gene YWHAZ (also named as 14-3-3 zeta/delta) in urothelial carcinomas of the urinary bladder (UCUB). A genome-wide study revealed YWHAZ to be involved in the amplicon at 8q22.3, and its genetic amplification was detected predominantly in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the association of YWHAZ overexpression with higher tumor stages, lymph node/vascular invasion, and mitotic activity. Univariate and multivariate analyses further indicated the prognostic potential of YWHAZ for more aggressive cancer types. Both gene set enrichment analysis and STRING network studies suggested involvement of YWHAZ in regulating caspase-mediated apoptosis. Ectopic expression of YWHAZ in bladder cells with low endogenous YWHAZ levels boosted cell resistance to doxorubicin and cisplatin, as well as to ionizing radiation. Conversely, YWHAZ-knockdown using specific shRNA in cells with high endogenous YWHAZ levels diminished survival activity, suppressing cell growth and increasing cell death. Our findings confirm the essential role played by YWHAZ in sustaining cell proliferation during chemo/radiotherapy. Treatments based on anti-YWHAZ strategies may thus be beneficial for UCUB patients overexpressing YWHAZ. © 2019 The Authors.

1187,"TWO FACTORS INFLUENCING DOSE RECONSTRUCTION IN LOW DOSE RANGE: THE VARIABILITY OF BKG INTENSITY ON ONE INDIVIDUAL AND WATER CONTENT A fast and accurate retrospective dosimetry method for the triage is very important in radiation accidents. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) fingernail dosimetry is a promising way to estimate radiation dose. This article presents two factors influencing dose reconstruction in low dose range: the variability of background signal (BKG) intensity on one individual and water content. Comparing the EPR spectrum of dried and humidified fingernail samples, it is necessary to add a procedure of dehydration before EPR measurements, so as to eliminate the deviation caused by water content. Besides, the BKGs of different fingers' nails are not the same as researchers thought previously, and the difference between maximum and minimum BKG intensities of one individual can reach 55.89 %. Meanwhile, the variability of the BKG intensity among individuals is large enough to impact precise dose reconstruction. Water within fingernails and instability of BKG are two reasons that cause the inaccuracy of radiation dose reconstruction in low-dosage level.Copyright © The Author 2015.

1157,"Lung cancer and cigarette smoking in Europe: An update of risk estimates and an assessment of inter-country heterogeneity Ten case-control studies have been carried out in 6 European countries to investigate the major risk factors for lung cancer. Carcinogenic effect from cigarette smoke was the most relevant interest in our study, which has included 7,609 cases of lung cancer and 10,431 controls, mainly population based. The results indicate elevated odds ratios (ORs; 23.9 among men and 8.7 among women) with attributable risks exceeding 90% for men and close to 60% for women. A large, and statistically significant, variability of the results across countries was detected after adjusting for the most common confounding variables, and after controlling, at least in part, for the instability of the ORs due to the small number of non-smokers in some of the study subsets. This pattern of lung cancer risk associated with cigarettes smoke, across different European regions, reflects inherent characteristics of the studies as well as differences in smoking habits, particularly calender periods of starting, and it is likely to have been influenced by effect modifiers like indoor radon exposure, occupation, air pollution and dietary habits. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded,0.70976716

To identify potential biomarkers, a preclinical trial was performed on ten different human squamous cell carcinoma xenografts of the head and neck (HNSCC) studying in vivo and ex vivo the effect of fractionated irradiation and EGFR inhibition. Local tumour control and tumour growth delay were correlated with potential biomarkers, e.g. EGFR gene amplification and radioresponse-associated gene expression profiles. Material and methods Local tumour control 120 days after end of irradiation was determined for fractionated radiotherapy alone (30 f, 6 weeks) or after simultaneous EGFR-inhibition with cetuximab. The EGFR gene amplification status was determined using FISH. Gene expression analyses were performed using an in-house gene panel. Results Six out of 10 investigated tumour models showed a significant increase in local tumour control for the combined treatment of cetuximab and fractionated radiotherapy compared to irradiation alone. For 3 of the 6 responding tumour models, an amplification of the EGFR gene could be demonstrated. Gene expression profiling of untreated tumours revealed significant differences between amplified and non-amplified tumours as well as between responder and non-responder tumours to combined radiotherapy and cetuximab. Conclusion The EGFR amplification status, in combination with gene expression profiling, may serve as a predictive biomarker for personalized interventional strategies regarding combined treatment of cetuximab and fractionated radiotherapy and should, as a next step, be clinically validated.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.6903833

975,"Stability and survival of bone-anchored hearing aid implant systems in post-irradiated patients Bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) are based on the principle of osseointegration, which is fundamental to implant stability and survival. Previous exposure to ionising radiation may compromise this, as evidenced in relation to dental and craniofacial implants. There is a dearth of data, however, regarding BAHA implant systems in patients with previously irradiated implant sites. We sought, therefore, to investigate implant stability and survival in such patients. Patients were identified retrospectively from our electronic BAHA database. Hospital records were reviewed for demographics; operative technique; complications; and details regarding previous irradiation. Implant stability was assessed by resonance frequency analysis (RFA), generating a numerical value-implant stability quotient (ISQ). Extrapolating from dental studies, successfully loaded implants typically have ISQs of >=60. Readings were, therefore, interpreted with respect to this. Seven patients were identified for inclusion. Mean time between irradiation and implant insertion was 33 months (range 16-72 months), and mean time from implant insertion to RFA measurement was 41 months (range 3-96 months). Operatively, all patients underwent single-stage procedures under local anaesthesia. One patient suffered a Holger's grade 2 skin reaction, while two suffered significant skin flap failure, requiring revision procedures. The implant survival rate was 100 %. All ISQ values were >60, with a mean of 66.9 (95 % confidence interval 63.1-70.6). Our data support sufficient osseointegration of BAHA implant systems in post-irradiated patients, but highlight issues with wound healing. Contemporary soft tissue preservation operative techniques will likely overcome this, facilitating safe and efficacious BAHA insertion in this ever-increasing group of patients.Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded,0.6828281

Questionnaire information included the self-reported distance of the three longest held residential addresses from fixed radio-television transmitters and mobile phone base stations. We georeferenced the residential addresses of all study subjects and obtained the spatial coordinates of mobile phone base stations. For each address within a 500-meter radius from a mobile phone base station, we estimated the RF-EMF intensity using predictions from spatial models, and we performed RF-EMF measurements at the door in the subset of the longest held addresses within a 250-meter radius. We calculated risk of lymphoma and its major subtypes associated with the RF-EMF exposure metrics with unconditional logistic regression, adjusting by age, gender and years of education. In the analysis of self-reported data, risk associated with residence in proximity (within 50 meters) to fixed radio-television transmitters was likewise elevated for lymphoma overall [odds ratio = 2.7, 95% confidence interval = 1.5-4.6], and for the major lymphoma subtypes. With reference to mobile phone base stations, we did not observe an association with either the self-reported, or the geocoded distance from mobile phone base stations. RF-EMF measurements did not vary by case-control status. By comparing the self-reports to the geocoded data, we discovered that the cases tended to underestimate the distance from mobile phone base stations differentially from the controls (P = 0.073). The interpretation of our findings is compromised by the limited study size, particularly in the analysis of the individual lymphoma subtypes, and the unavailability of the spatial coordinates of radio-television transmitters. Nonetheless, our results do not support the hypothesis of a link between environmental exposure to RF-EMF from mobile phone base stations and risk of lymphoma subtypes.Copyright © 2018 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.6816987

The incidence of brain tumors varies and it is higher in developed countries of Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. In Serbia, according to data from 2009, malignant brain tumors account for 2.2 of all tumors, and from all cancer-related deaths, 3.2% is caused by malignant brain tumors. According to recent statistical reports, an overall incidence of brain tumors for benign and malignant tumors combined is 18.71 per 100,000 persons/year. The most common benign brain tumor in adults is meningioma, which is most present in women, and the most common malignant tumor is glioblastoma, which is most present in adult men. Due to high mortality, especially in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma and significant brain tumor morbidity, there is a constant interest in understanding its etiology in order to possibly prevent tumor occurrence in future and enable more efficient treatment strategies for this fatal brain disease. Despite the continuously growing number of epidemiological studies on possible factors of tumor incidence, the etiology remains unclear.

According to Tubiana, 73 hands had Stage N, 61 Stage N/I (<= 10degree flexion deformity), 59 Stage I (11 to 45degree) and 5 Stage II disease (46 to 90degree). Radiotherapy was randomly delivered: group A (63 patients/95 hands) received 10 times 3 Gy (total: 30 Gy) in 2 series (each 5 times 3 Gy) separated by 8 weeks; group B (66 patients/103 hands) received 7 times 3 Gy (total: 21 Gy) within 2 weeks. Orthovoltage radiotherapy (120 kV) with 40 cm standard cones and individual shielding was applied. Patient and disease parameters were equally distributed in both groups. Evaluation (toxicity, efficacy) was performed at 3 and 12 months with regard to subjective (patient's opinion) and objective parameters (palpation, measurements, comparative photographs - physician). Result(s): Acute toxicity was minimal: 76 (38%) hands had skin reactions CTC Grade 1, 12 (6%) CTC Grade 2. Chronic side effects (dryness, skin atrophy, change of sensation, LENT Grade 1) occurred in 9 (5%) hands without differences between treatment groups. At 3 and 12 months follow-up, subjective symptoms and objective signs, nodules and cords, were reduced in both groups (p < 0.01) with no differences between groups: a total of 110 (55%) hands (group A: 55, group B: 55) regressed, 74 (37%) hands (group A: 35; group B: 39) were stable. Overall and mean number of nodules, cords and skin changes decreased at 3 and 12 months. 16 of 198 (8%) hands (group A: 7; group B: 9) progressed at 12 months follow-up (""treatment failure""); at 1 year, 7 of 60 patients with unilateral Dupyutren's disease required prophylactic radiotherapy for the contralateral hand due to disease progression.

Individuals' mental and physical health and neighborhood connectedness were found to be significantly correlated with their happiness. However, the disaster-related variables of people's evaluation of recovery achievement, concerns around the health impacts of radiation, property loss in the disaster, and experiences of casualty, had no effects on happiness., CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that policies and countermeasures dealing with disaster recovery over the long term should continuously focus on health issues and social relationships.",Excluded,0.66800904
319,"Indications of future decreasing trends in skin-melanoma mortality among whites in the United States Trends in skin melanoma death rates during a 35-year period, 1950-84, were analyzed according to age, sex, and birth cohort for whites in the United States. In contrast to upward trends observed for older men and women (i.e., over 40), downward trends were noted for younger age groups. The risk of dying from skin melanoma appears to have peaked for male cohorts born during the 1950s and for female cohorts born during the 1930s. Assuming no future environmental or lifestyle changes, the upward trend in age-adjusted mortality rates, which averaged 2 to 3% per annum since 1950, is projected to discontinue and bend downward by the second decade of the 21st century. Skin melanoma incidence data, which was limited to a series of 12 years (1973-84) and inadequate for cohort analyses, were included to demonstrate that trends in age-specific rates were comparable with those observed for mortality during the overlapping time period. Incidence trends according to anatomical site are also described.

643,"Extracorporeal irradiation of tumorous calvaria: a case series OBJECT When intracranial tumors invade the overlying skull, gross resection typically includes removal of the involved bone. Methods used to repair the resulting structural defect in the cranium include artificial prostheses, allogeneic bone grafts, and autoclaving the autologous graft. The authors have previously reported a case involving high-dose extracorporeal ionizing radiation to treat the tumorous calvaria intraoperatively, followed by reimplantation of the treated bone flap. In this paper the authors report the long-term follow-up of that case, as well as results of using extracorporeal irradiation of tumorous calvaria (EITC) for an additional 20 patients treated similarly. METHODS The decision to undergo EITC was typically anticipated preoperatively, but determined intraoperatively, if upon inspection the bone flap was invaded by tumor. The bone flap was then delivered to the radiation oncology department, where a total dose of 120 Gy was delivered, using a clinical linear accelerator, over a period of approximately 15 minutes. After the intracranial tumor resection was completed, the irradiated craniotomy bone flap was reimplanted and the wound was closed in a standard fashion. A retrospective review of patients who had undergone EITC was performed for evidence of calvarial tumor recurrence or other complications. RESULTS Since the originally reported case, 20 additional patients have received EITC during craniotomy for invasive tumors. Eighteen (86%) of 21 patients were diagnosed with meningioma: 12 (67%) with WHO Grade I, 5 (28%) with WHO Grade II, and 1 with WHO Grade III (6%). The remaining 3 patients presented with dural-based B-cell lymphoma with extensive adjacent bone invasion (n = 2) and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung (n = 1). Follow-up of the 21 patients ranged from 1 to 132 months, with a mean of 41 months and a median of 23 months. No patients have experienced tumor recurrence, infection associated with the treated calvaria, or evidence of bone flap resorption. CONCLUSIONS Calvaria reconstructions represent an important component in structural and cosmetic outcome following craniectomy for tumorous bone. The authors' long-term experience with EITC has been excellent with no local tumor recurrence or complications. Therefore, EITC represents an excellent and efficient option for cranial reconstruction in such patients.",Excluded,0.6279344
458,"Radical radiation treatment of invasive and locally advanced bladder carcinoma in elderly patients A total of 146 patients with invasive or locally advanced carcinoma of the bladder (T2-T4) underwent radiation treatment. A significantly higher complete response rate was observed with doses equal to or above 55 Gy and with doses corresponding to cumulative radiation effect (CRE) values of 1700 radiation effect units (reu) or more. In multivariate analysis, decreasing time from the first diagnosis of bladder carcinoma to radiation treatment and 1 or more transurethral resections was associated with a significant increase in survival; increases in T category and sedimentation rate were negative prognostic factors. Although both radiation dose and CRE levels had a significant effect on survival in univariate analysis, an increase in CRE levels alone was associated with a significant increase in survival in multivariate analysis. However, the most important predictor of survival was whether the patient showed a complete local response or not. This study emphasises the importance of treating patients with an adequate radiation dose over a short period of time in order to achieve the maximum radiobiological effect and thereby increase the possibility of cure.",Excluded,0.6220848
868,"Use of IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients with in-stent restenosis treated with intracoronary gamma-radiation. Integrilin WRIST The Integrilin Washington Radiation for In-Stent Restenosis Trial (WRIST) aimed to study the impact of IIb/IIIa inhibitors as adjunct therapy to intracoronary radiation therapy (IRT) for patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR). The impact of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (eptifibatide) as adjunct therapy to vascular brachytherapy using (192)Ir emitter was examined in patients with in-stent restenosis. In the study, 150 patients were assigned to eptifibatide (Integrilin) and 150 patients to heparin only. Clinical composite endpoints at 30 days were similar between the patients treated with and without eptifibatide (4.7% vs. 4.0%; P = 0.78). There was a similarity in the non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) rates between the eptifibatide and the control group. Major bleeding was similar in patients treated with and without eptifibatide. Overall, the use of eptifibatide as adjunct therapy for patients with ISR that are treated with IRT did not impact the clinical outcome at 30 days.

24,"A Novel In Vivo Protocol for Molecular Study of Radiation-Induced Fibrosis in Head and Neck Cancer Patients OBJECTIVES: Radiation-induced fibrosis is a common complication for patients following head and neck cancer treatment. This study presents a novel minimally invasive protocol for molecular study of fibrosis in the stromal tissues., METHODS: Subjects with radiation-induced fibrosis in the head and neck who were at least 6 months post treatment received submental core needle biopsies, followed by molecular processing and quantification of gene expression for 14 select pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes. Control biopsies from the upper arm were obtained from the same subjects. Patients were followed up at 1 and 2 weeks to monitor for safety and adverse outcomes., RESULTS: Six subjects were enrolled and completed the study. No subjects experienced adverse outcomes or complication. An 18 gauge core biopsy needle with a 10 mm notch inserted for up to 60 seconds was needed. Subcutaneous tissue yielded 3 ng of RNA, amplified to 6 microg of cDNA, allowing for adequately sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of approximately 28 genes., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the safety and utility of a novel technique for the molecular study of fibrosis in head and neck cancer patients. Longitudinal studies of patients undergoing radiation therapy will allow for identification of molecular targets that contribute to the process of fibrosis in the head and neck.

910,"T95 nucleophosmin phosphorylation as a novel mediator and marker of regulated cell death in acute kidney injury The function of site-specific phosphorylation of nucleophosmin (NPM), an essential Bax chaperone, in stress-induced cell death is unknown. We hypothesized that NPM threonine 95 (T95) phosphorylation both signals and promotes cell death. In resting cells, NPM exclusively resides in the nucleus and T95 is nonphosphorylated. In contrast, phosphorylated T95 NPM (pNPM T95) accumulates in the cytosol after metabolic stress, in multiple human cancer cell lines following gamma-radiation, and in postischemic human kidney tissue. Based on the T95 phosphorylation consensus sequence, we hypothesized that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) regulates cytosolic NPM translocation by phosphorylating T95 NPM. In a cell-free system, GSK-3beta phosphorylated a synthetic NPM peptide containing T95. In vitro, bidirectional manipulation of GSK-3beta activity substantially altered T95 phosphorylation, cytosolic NPM translocation, and cell survival during stress, mechanistically linking these lethal events. Furthermore, GSK-3beta inhibition in vivo decreased cytosolic pNPM T95 accumulation in kidney tissue after experimental ischemia. In patients with acute kidney injury, both cytosolic NPM accumulation in proximal tubule cells and NPM-rich intratubular casts were detected in frozen renal biopsy tissue. These observations show, for the first time, that GSK-3beta promotes cell death partly by phosphorylating NPM at T95, to promote cytosolic NPM accumulation. T95 NPM is also a rational therapeutic target to ameliorate ischemic renal cell injury and may be a universal injury marker in mammalian cells.Copyright © 2020 the American Physiological Society",Excluded,0.593485
819,"Adjuvant radiotherapy for margin-positive high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity Purpose: Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) has been shown to improve local control in patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities (STS). The specific impact of adjuvant radiation on patients with positive margins, however, has not been clearly defined. The purpose of this study was to determine if adjuvant RT improves local control in patients with high-grade STS who had positive margins of resection. Methods and Materials: Between 8/82 and 2/97, 110 adult patients with primary high-grade STS of an extremity underwent limb sparing surgery and were found to have a histologically positive microscopic surgical margin. Ninety-one (83%) received RT and 19 (17%) had no RT. The two groups were balanced with regard to size, site, location, and tumor depth. Adjuvant RT was delivered with brachytherapy (BRT) alone in 34 patients, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) alone in 33 patients, or BRT+EBRT in 24 patients. The BRT dose was 45 Gy when used alone and 15-20 Gy when used as a boost. The EBRT dose was 60-70 Gy when used alone and 45-50 Gy when given with BRT. The median follow-up time was 41 months (range, 3-186 months). Result(s): The overall 5 year local control rate was 71%. This rate was significantly higher in the RT group compared to the no RT group (74% vs. 56%, respectively) (p = 0.01). On univariate analysis, lower extremity site and proximal location were also found to be predictors of improved local control (p = 0.03 and 0.03, respectively). However, only proximal location and the use of RT retained their significance as predictors of improved local control on multivariate analysis (p = 0.003 and 0.01, respectively). The overall 5-year distant relapse-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 54%, 44%, and 53%, respectively. No statistical differences were found in these survival rates between RT and no RT groups. Conclusion(s): Based on this study, adjuvant radiotherapy seems to improve local control in patients with high-grade STS of the extremity with positive margins. However, local recurrence still occurs in a substantial proportion of patients, mandating further need for improvement. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded,0.59176356
1087,"Convection enhanced delivery of carboplatin in combination with radiotherapy for the treatment of brain tumors The purpose of this study was to further evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of convection enhanced delivery (CED) of carboplatin in combination with radiotherapy for treatment of the F98 rat glioma. Tumor cells were implanted stereotactically into the brains of syngeneic Fischer rats, and 13 or 17 d. later carboplatin (20 mug/10 mul) was administered by either CED over 30 min or by Alzet osmotic pumps (0.5 mug/mul/h for 168 h.) beginning at 7 d after tumor implantation. Rats were irradiated with a 15 Gy fractionated dose (5 Gy x 3) of 6 MV photons to the whole brain beginning on the day after drug administration. Other groups of rats received either carboplatin or X-irradiation alone. The tumor carboplatin concentration following CED of 20 mug in 10 mul was 10.4 mug/g, which was equal to that observed following i.v. administration of 100 mg/kg b.w. Rats bearing small tumors, treated with carboplatin and X-irradiation, had a mean survival time (MST) of 83.4 d following CED and 111.8 d following pump delivery with 40% of the latter surviving >180 d (i.e. cured) compared to 55.2 d for CED and 77.2 d. for pump delivery of carboplatin alone and 31.8 d and 24.2 d, respectively, for X-irradiated and untreated controls. There was no microscopic evidence of residual tumor in the brains of all long-term survivors. Not surprisingly, rats with large tumors had much shorter MSTs. Only modest increases in MSTs were observed in animals that received either oral administration or CED of temozolomide plus X-irradiation (23.2 d and 29.3 d) compared to X-irradiation alone. The present survival data, and those previously reported by us, are among the best ever obtained with the F98 glioma model. Initially, they could provide a platform for a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and potential therapeutic efficacy of CED of carboplatin in patients with recurrent glioblastomas, and ultimately a Phase II trial of carboplatin in combination with radiation therapy.",Excluded,0.591463

724,"No effects of a single 3G UMTS mobile phone exposure on spontaneous EEG activity, ERP correlates, and automatic deviance detection Potential effects of a 30 min exposure to third generation (3G) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile phone-like electromagnetic fields (EMFs) were investigated on human brain electrical activity in two experiments. In the first experiment, spontaneous electroencephalography (sEEG) was analyzed (n = 17); in the second experiment, auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) and automatic deviance detection processes reflected by mismatch negativity (MMN) were investigated in a passive oddball paradigm (n = 26). Both sEEG and ERP experiments followed a double-blind protocol where subjects were exposed to either genuine or sham irradiation in two separate sessions. In both experiments, electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded at midline electrode sites before and after exposure while subjects were watching a silent documentary. Spectral power of sEEG data was analyzed in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. In the ERP experiment, subjects were presented with a random series of standard (90%) and frequency-deviant (10%) tones in a passive binaural oddball paradigm. The amplitude and latency of the P50, N100, P200, MMN, and P3a components were analyzed. We found no measurable effects of a 30 min 3G mobile phone irradiation on the EEG spectral power in any frequency band studied. Also, we found no significant effects of EMF irradiation on the amplitude and latency of any of the ERP components. In summary, the present results do not support the notion that a 30 min unilateral 3G EMF exposure interferes with human sEEG activity, auditory evoked potentials or automatic deviance detection indexed by MMN.

243,"Ionizing radiation and genetic risks. VI. Chronic multifactorial diseases: a review of epidemiological and genetical aspects of coronary heart disease, essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus This paper provides a broad overview of the epidemiological and genetical aspects of common multifactorial diseases in man with focus on three well-studied ones, namely, coronary heart disease (CHD), essential hypertension (EHYT) and diabetes mellitus (DM). In contrast to mendelian diseases, for which a mutant gene either in the heterozygous or homozygous condition is generally sufficient to cause disease, for most multifactorial diseases, the concepts of genetic susceptibility' and risk factors' are more appropriate. For these diseases, genetic susceptibility is heterogeneous. The well-studied diseases such as CHD permit one to conceptualize the complex relationships between genotype and phenotype for chronic multifactorial diseases in general, namely that allelic variations in genes, through their products interacting with environmental factors, contribute to the quantitative variability of biological risk factor traits and thus ultimately to disease outcome. Two types of such allelic variations can be distinguished, namely those in genes whose mutant alleles have (i) small to moderate effects on the risk factor trait, are common in the population (polymorphic alleles) and therefore contribute substantially to the variability of biological risk factor traits and (ii) profound effects, are rare in the population and therefore contribute far less to the variability of biological risk factor traits. For all the three diseases considered in this review, a positive family history is a strong risk factor. CHD is one of the major contributors to mortality in most industrialized countries. Evidence from epidemiological studies, clinical correlations, genetic hyperlipidaemias etc., indicate that lipids play a key role in the pathogenesis of CHD. The known lipid-related risk factors include: high levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol, low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, high apoB levels (the major protein fraction of the low density lipoprotein particles) and elevated levels of Lp(a) lipoprotein. Among the risk factors which are not related to lipids are: high levels of homocysteine, low activity of paraoxonase and possibly also elevated plasma fibrinogen levels. In addition to the above, hypertension, diabetes and obesity (which themselves have genetic determinants) are important risk factors for CHD. Among the environmental risk factors are: high dietary fat intake, smoking, stress, lack of exercise etc. About 60% of the variability of the plasma cholesterol is genetic in origin. While a few genes have been identified whose mutant alleles have large effects on this trait (e.g., LDLR, familial defective apoB-100), variability in cholesterol levels among individuals in most families is influenced by allelic variation in many genes (polymorphisms) as well as environmental exposures. A proportion of this variation can be accounted for by two alleles of the apoE locus that increase (&epsi;4) and decrease (&epsi;2) cholesterol levels, respectively. A polymorphism at the apoB gene (XbaI) also has similar effects, but is probably not mediated through lipids. High density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are genetically influenced and are related to apoA1 and hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene functions. Mutations in the apoA1 gene are rare and there are data which suggest a role of allelic variation at or linked LIPC gene in high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Polymorphism at the apoA1--C3 loci is often associated with hypertriglyceridemia. The apo(a) gene which codes for Lp(a) is highly polymorphic, each allele determining a specific number of multiple tandem repeats of a unique coding sequence known as Kringle 4. The size of the gene correlates with the size of the Lp(a) protein. The smaller the size of the Lp(a) protein, the higher are the Lp(a) levels. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",Excluded,0.5805254
500,"[ERCP procedures as a source of radiation risk to a single gastroenterologist] BACKGROUND: One of the numerous sub-areas of interventional radiology is the use of X-rays in gastroenterology. X-ray fluoroscopy is applied in therapeutic procedures, including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) that is frequently performed. The ERCP procedure is aimed at imaging the pancreatic duct and biliary tracts., MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this paper radiation risk to the gastrenterologist performing ERCP procedures was investigated. The procedures were performed by a single gastroenterologist in the ERCP Laboratory, University Clinical Hospital Military Memorial Medical Academy - Central Veterans' Hospital in Lodz, Poland. The study comprised 2 series of measurements, one taken during the procedures with continuous fluoroscopy mode, the other during procedures with fluoroscopy in pulsed mode at a frequency of 3 pulses/s. Exposure parameters, anatomical data of patient and dose equivalents for the eyes, skin of the hand and the effective dose for whole body of the gastroenterologist were recorded during each procedure., RESULTS: The collected data cover 70 ERCP procedures - 40 procedures were controlled by continuous fluoroscopy and 30 by pulsed fluoroscopy. The results reveal that pulsed fluoroscopy makes it possible to reduce doses received by the gastroeneterologist from 45% to 60% compared to continuous fluoroscopy., CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures can cause radiation risk to the gastroenterologist performing them. The use of continuous fluoroscopy can result in achieving an equivalent dose to eye lens nearly 20 mSv per year, i.e., the decreased annual limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).

Frequency of skin reactions may be influenced by skin pigmentation and psychological factors. A Symptom Inventory completed by 656 cancer patients nationwide before and after chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy plus radiation therapy was analysed to determine if treatment type, race (Black vs White), and pretreatment expectations influenced post-treatment skin reactions. Subsequent analysis of a local Symptom Inventory completed weekly for 5 weeks by 308 patients receiving radiation therapy examined severity of reported skin reactions. Significantly more patients receiving radiation therapy had stronger expectations of skin problems (62%) than patients receiving chemotherapy (40%, P=0.001) or chemotherapy plus radiation therapy (45%, P=0.003). Overall, expectations did not correlate with patient reported post-treatment skin problems in white (r=0.014, P=0.781) or black (r=0.021, P=0.936) patients. Although no significant difference was found between black and white patients in their pretreatment expectations of skin problems (P=0.32), black patients (10 out of 18, 56%) reported more skin problems than white patients (90 out of 393, 23%, P=0.001). Similarly, the local study showed that significantly more black patients (1 out of 5, 20%) reported severe skin reactions at the treatment site than white patients (12 out of 161, 8%). A direct correlation was observed between severity of skin problems and pain at the treatment site (r=0.541, P<0.001). Total radiation exposure did not significantly correlate with the report of skin problems at the treatment site for white or black patients. Overall, black patients reported more severe post-treatment skin problems than white patients.

This study was conducted to define the exact doses resulting in radiation-induced liver diseases (RILD) and dose constraints for the critical organs at risk (OARs) in mice, which are still undefined in HCC SBRT. Materials/Methods: This study was consisted of 2 phases. In the primary phase, mice treated with helical tomotherapy based SBRT were stratified according to escalating radiation doses to the livers. Pathological differences, signs, such as mouse performance status (MPS), and serum aspartate/ alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT)/albumin levels were observed. Radiation-induced disease severities of OARs were scored using systematic evaluation standards. In the validation phase in human, 13 patients with HCC who had undergone radiation therapy before hepatectomy were enrolled to validate RILD pathological changes in mice study. Result(s): Evaluation criteria of mouse liver radiation therapy relating signs were as follows: MPS >=2.0+/-0.52, AST/ALT >=589.2+/-118.5/137.4+/-15.3 U/L, serum albumin <=16.8+/-2.29 g/L. Preliminary dose constraints of OARs had also been obtained, such as livers: average dose <=26.36+/-1.71 Gy and gastrointestinal tract: maximum dose <=22.63 Gy.
