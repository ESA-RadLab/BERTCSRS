350,"Growth hormone mitigates against lethal irradiation and enhances hematologic and immune recovery in mice and nonhuman primates Medications that can mitigate against radiation injury are limited. In this study, we investigated the ability of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) to mitigate against radiation injury in mice and nonhuman primates. BALB/c mice were irradiated with 7.5 Gy and treated post-irradiation with rhGH intravenously at a once daily dose of 20 mug/dose for 35 days. rhGH protected 17 out of 28 mice (60.7%) from lethal irradiation while only 3 out of 28 mice (10.7%) survived in the saline control group. A shorter course of 5 days of rhGH post-irradiation produced similar results. Compared with the saline control group, treatment with rhGH on irradiated BALB/c mice significantly accelerated overall hematopoietic recovery. Specifically, the recovery of total white cells, CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets, B cells, NK cells and especially platelets post radiation exposure were significantly accelerated in the rhGH-treated mice. Moreover, treatment with rhGH increased the frequency of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells as measured by flow cytometry and colony forming unit assays in bone marrow harvested at day 14 after irradiation, suggesting the effects of rhGH are at the hematopoietic stem/progenitor level. rhGH mediated the hematopoietic effects primarily through their niches. Similar data with rhGH were also observed following 2 Gy sublethal irradiation of nonhuman primates. Our data demonstrate that rhGH promotes hematopoietic engraftment and immune recovery post the exposure of ionizing radiation and mitigates against the mortality from lethal irradiation even when administered after exposure. © 2010 Chen et al.",Excluded,0.983179
767,"[Carcinogenic effects of single total-body irradiation with accelerated charged particles and gamma rays] The study deals with the frequency of tumorigenesis in the endocrine glands, skin, soft tissues and internal organs of sexually mature female rats, exposed to accelerated charged particles with low LPE, such components of cosmic radiation as 645 MeV and 9 GeV protons and 4 GeV/nuclon ions of helium. The experiment continued until the animals' natural death. We established a high frequency of endocrine and uterine tumors and a comparatively wide range of localizations in rats which had received sufficient doses of gamma radiation. There were no intestinal or renal tumors, while very few tumors of the skin and soft tissues were detected in unexposed animals.",Excluded,0.983158
216,"Incidence of Breast Cancer in the Life Span Study of Atomic Bomb Survivors: 1958-2009 The importance of reproductive history in breast tissue development and etiology of sporadic breast cancer in females is well established. However, there is limited evidence of factors, other than age, that modify risk of radiation-related breast cancer. In this study, we evaluated breast cancer incidence in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors, adding 11 years of follow-up and incorporating reproductive history data. We used Poisson regression models to describe radiation risks and modifying effects of age and reproductive factors. Among 62,534 females, we identified 1,470 breast cancers between 1958 and 2009. Of 397 new cases diagnosed since 1998, 75% were exposed before age 20. We found a strong linear dose response with excess relative risk (ERR) of 1.12 per Gy [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73 to 1.59] for females at age 70 after exposure at age 30. The ERR decreased with increasing attained age ( P = 0.007) while excess absolute rate (EAR) increased with attained age up to age 70 ( P < 0.001). Age at menarche was a strong modifier of the radiation effect: for a given dose, both the ERR and EAR decreased with increasing age at menarche ( P = 0.007 and P < 0.001). Also, independently, age-at-exposure effects on ERR and EAR differed before and after menarche ( P = 0.043 and P = 0.015, respectively, relative to log-linear trends), with highest risks for exposures around menarche. Despite the small number of male breast cancers (n = 10), the data continue to suggest a dose response (ERR per Gy = 5.7; 95% CI: 0.3 to 30.8; P = 0.018). Persistently increased risk of female breast cancer after radiation exposure and its modification pattern suggests heightened breast sensitivity during puberty.",Excluded,0.98315144
258,"In vitro fertilization rate of mouse oocytes with spermatozoa from the F1 offspring of males irradiated with 1.0 Gy 137Cs gamma-rays Previous studies suggest that the spermatozoa from acutely irradiated male mice exhibit a reduced fertilization rate in vitro with the maximum decrease occurring for spermatozoa produced 6 weeks after irradiation (Y. Matsuda et al., Mutation Res. 142 (1985) 59-63). We have found that spermatozoa from unirradiated F1 males conceived 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation also exhibit a significantly reduced fertilization rate in vitro. After acute 137Cs gamma-irradiation yielding an absorbed dose of 1.0 Gy, adult CD1 F0 male mice were mated at weekly intervals with unirradiated female CD1 mice. Unirradiated adult males from F1 litters conceived 5 and 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation were allowed to mature. Their epididymal spermatozoa were evaluated for in vitro fertilization rates using oocytes from unirradiated 8-12-week-old CD1 females. The mean fertilization rate for spermatozoa from F1 males conceived 5 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (80.74 +/- 15.74 SD %, n = 5) did not differ significantly from the control fertilization rate (89.40 +/- 10.94 SD %, n = 8). However, the fertilization rate for spermatozoa from F1 males conceived 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (56.14 +/- 21.93 SD %, n = 5) was significantly less than the fertilization rate for control spermatozoa (p < 0.006) or for that of the F1 males conceived 5 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (p < 0.04). These data suggest that spermatozoa obtained 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation can transmit a decrease in fertilization rate to the F1 generation males as well as exhibit decreased fertilization rate themselves when tested directly in vitro.",Excluded,0.98306215
48,"Chronic bronchitis in the cohort of Mayak workers first employed 1948-1958 Incidence of chronic bronchitis has been studied in a cohort of 12,210 workers first employed at one of the main plants of the Mayak nuclear facility during 1948-1958 and followed up to 31 December 2005. Information on external gamma doses is available for virtually all of these workers; in contrast, plutonium body burden was measured only for 30% of workers. During the follow-up period in the study cohort 1,175 incident cases of chronic bronchitis were verified. The analyses of nonradiation factors revealed that the underlying risk of chronic bronchitis incidence increased with increasing attained age and was higher among smokers compared with never-smokers as would be expected. The most interesting finding in relationship to nonradiation factors was a sharp increase in the baseline chronic bronchitis risk before 1960. The cause of this is not clear but a number of factors may play a role. Based on the follow-up data after 1960, the analysis showed a statistically significant linear dose response relationship with cumulative external gamma-ray dose (ERR/Gy = 0.14, 95% CI 0.01, 0.32). Based on the same subset but with an additional restriction to members with cumulative internal lung dose below 1 Gy, a statistically significant linear dose response relationship with internal alpha-radiation lung dose from incorporated plutonium was found (ERR/Gy = 2.70, 95% CI 1.20, 4.87). In both cases, adjustment was made for nonradiation factors, including smoking and either internal or external dose as appropriate. At present there are no similar incidence studies with which to compare results. However, the most recent data from the atomic bomb survivor cohort (the Life Span Study) showed statistically significant excess mortality risk for respiratory diseases of 22% per Gy and this value is within the confidence bounds of the point estimate of the risk from this study in relation to external dose.",Excluded,0.98305124
896,"Impacts of ionising radiation on sperm quality, DNA integrity and post-fertilisation development in marine and freshwater crustaceans Crustaceans have been designated as internationally important model organisms in the development of environmental radioprotection measures. Despite the known sensitivity of sperm to ionizing radiation, the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility in crustaceans have not been studied. For the first time, the present study aimed to assess the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility, sperm DNA damage and concomitant impacts on breeding in two amphipod crustaceans. Echinogammarus marinus and Gammarus pulex (male fertility only) were exposed to phosphorus-32 at dose rates of 0, 0.1, 1 and 10mGy/d and sperm parameters, DNA damage and knock-on impacts on breeding were assessed. Sperm quality parameters and DNA damage were assessed using a fluorescent staining method and single cell gel electrophoresis respectively. Concomitant effects of male exposure to radiation on fecundity were determined by pairing phosphorus-32 exposed males to unexposed sexually mature females. In E. marinus, a statistically significant reduction of 9 and 11% in the quality of sperm was recorded at dose rates of 1 and 10mGy/d respectively, with no significant effects recorded on sperm counts. Conversely in the freshwater G. pulex, no significant impact of radiation on sperm quantity or quality was recorded. For E. marinus, a statistically significant increase in DNA damage was recorded at doses of 10mGy/d. Reduced fecundity and an increase in the frequency of abnormal embryos was recorded in female E. marinus breeding with males exposed to radiation. These findings suggest sperm quality may be a sensitive indicator of radiation exposure in invertebrates with potential impacts on the unexposed embryo, though unclear dose-response and differences between two closely related species necessitate further study before robust conclusions can be drawn.

546,"Molecular and cellular profiling of acute responses to total body radiation exposure in ovariectomized female cynomolgus macaques Purpose: The threat of radiation exposure requires a mechanistic understanding of radiation-induced immune injury and recovery. The study objective was to evaluate responses to ionizing radiation in ovariectomized (surgically post-menopausal) female cynomolgus macaques. Material(s) and Method(s): Animals received a single total-body irradiation (TBI) exposure at doses of 0, 2 or 5 Gy with scheduled necropsies at 5 days, 8 weeks and 24 weeks post-exposure. Blood and lymphoid tissues were evaluated for morphologic, cellular, and molecular responses. Result(s): Irradiated animals developed symptoms of acute hematopoietic syndrome, and reductions in thymus weight, thymopoiesis, and bone marrow cellularity. Acute, transient increases in plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) were observed in 5 Gy animals along with dose-dependent alterations in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) signatures in thymus, spleen, and lymph node. Expression of T cell markers was lower in thymus and spleen, while expression of macrophage marker CD68 (cluster of differentiation 68) was relatively elevated in lymphoid tissues from irradiated animals. Conclusion(s): Ovariectomized female macaques exposed to moderate doses of radiation experienced increased morbidity, including acute, dose-dependent alterations in systemic and tissue-specific biomarkers, and increased macrophage/T cell ratios. The effects on mortality exceeded expectations based on previous studies in males, warranting further investigation.Copyright © 2015 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded,0.9830496

827,"Apoptosis induced by gamma irradiation of Taenia solium metacestodes Gamma irradiation of food is considered a possible approach to control food-borne diseases. In cysticercosis, previous studies have shown that irradiating (with 0.3 kGy) pork infected with Taenia solium larvae completely inhibits growth of the parasite. This study was conducted to evaluate the mechanisms that induce the effect of gamma irradiation on metacestodes of T. solium. Metacestodes were obtained from several infected pigs and irradiated with a dose of 0.3 kGy. The viability of the metacestodes was evaluated by their capacity to evaginate in vitro and in vivo development to tapeworms after they were orally infected into prednisolone-treated golden hamsters. Using the typical ladder pattern of fragmented DNA and the TdT-mediated DUTP-nick-end labeling assay, apoptosis was evaluated in metacestodes after irradiation and in the scolices and tapeworms recovered from infected hamsters at 21 days post-infection. Apoptosis was observed in the structure of scolices obtained from hamsters at 21 days post-infection with irradiated metacestodes, This study provides evidence of the existence of apoptosis in the irradiated metacestodes of T. solium and helps elucidate the possible mechanisms that are involved when gamma irradiation inhibits the normal development of the T. solium metacestode into the adult worm.",Excluded,0.98297125

Using an ana-telophase method, 24-hour exposure of males to soiled bedding containing isolated females chemosignals was shown to lead to a significantly lower frequency of chromosomal aberrations and other meiotic disturbances in spermatocytes I as compared to males kept on clean bedding. The same effect of female chemosignals was found in the reproductive cells of irradiated males (4 Gr).

168,"Apoptosis of Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes in the Members of the Techa River Cohort Chronically Exposed to Radiation The purpose of the present research was to estimate the intensity of the apoptotic death of lymphocytes during the period of carcinogenic effect realization in the residents of the Techa riverside villages. The investigation included analyses of the frequency of lymphocytes at the early and late stages of apoptosis and necrosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes using the method of FITC Annexin V, lymphocyte counts at the stage of DNA fragmentation using the TUNEL method, and the number of CD95(+)-lymphocytes. In the capacity of additional tests, loading tests involving in vitro irradiation at the dose of 1 Gy of a suspension of lymphocytes and incubations for 5 and 24 hours were used. Activation of the initial apoptotic and necrotic death of peripheral blood lymphocytes was revealed in the persons chronically exposed to low-intensity radiation within the range from 0.01 to 4.23 Gy. Exposed patients demonstrated a decrease in the number of CD95(+)-cells as compared to unexposed patients.

121,"[Assessment of the genetic risk of radiation by irradiation data from laboratory mammals] An attempt has been made to assess quantitatively genetic risk of radiation for man based on mammalian (mostly mouse) data and using the direct method proposed by UNSCEAR. The parameter employed was induction of reciprocal translocations. Two assumptions were made: human radiosensitivity equals that of the mouse; and dose-response is linear. From observations with acute gamma irradiation the estimate of risk per 10(-2) Gy was as follows: 39 translocation heterozygotes are expected among one million F1 conceptions, 5 cases of multiple congenital anomalies, 25 abortions recorded and 49 unrecorded. Chronic gamma irradiation at dose rates of 1.3 X 10(-5), 1.7 X 10(-4) and 1.0 X 10(-4) Gy/min was 3 to 10 times less effective. Exposure to 4.2 GeV deuterons proved inferior in effectiveness to gamma irradiation. Chronic exposure to 4.1 MeV neutrons delivered at 8 X 10(-4) Gy/min showed 7 times the effectiveness of chronic gamma irradiation. Administration of tritiated water (from 37 to 37 X 10(2) kBq/g b.w.) to rats entailed a risk of the same order of magnitude as external chronic gamma irradiation. Reduction of genetic risk was achieved by pretreatment with either AFT-, ATP-serotonin mixtures or the molecular combinations, Adeturon and Cytriphos. Study of interspecies differences in genetic radiosensitivity showed decline in the following order: rat-rabbit-mouse-Syrian hamster. A dose-rate effect was most clearly seen in the rat, and least clearly in the rabbit. In female mice, examination of oocyte depletion indicated primary follicles to be highly susceptible to acute gamma irradiation; decrease in sensitivity was observed beginning with stage 4. Chronic gamma irradiation was found to be less effective.",Excluded,0.982908
672,"Cancer risk estimation of genotoxic chemicals based on target dose and a multiplicative model A mechanistic model and associated procedures are proposed for cancer risk assessment of genotoxic chemicals. As previously shown for ionizing radiation, a linear multiplicative model was found to be compatible with published experimental data for ethylene oxide, acrylamide, and butadiene. The validity of this model was anticipated in view of the multiplicative interaction of mutation with inherited and acquired growth-promoting conditions. Concurrent analysis led to rejection of an additive model (i.e. the model commonly applied for cancer risk assessment). A reanalysis of data for radiogenic cancer in mouse, dog and man shows that the relative risk coefficient is approximately the same (0.4 to 0.5 percent per rad) for tumours induced in the three species. Doses in vivo, defined as the time- integrated concentrations of ultimate mutagens, expressed in millimol x kg- 1 x h (mMh) are, like radiation doses given in Gy or rad, proportional to frequencies of potentially mutagenic events. The radiation dose equivalents of chemical doses are, calculated by multiplying chemical doses (in mMh) with the relative genotoxic potencies (in rad x mMh-1) determined in vitro. In this way the relative cancer incidence increments in rats and mice exposed to ethylene oxide were shown to be about 0.4 percent per rad-equivalent, in agreement with the data for radiogenic cancer. Our analyses suggest that values of the relative risk coefficients for genotoxic chemicals are independent of species and that relative cancer risks determined in animal tests apply also to humans. If reliable animal test data are not available, cancer risks may be estimated by the relative potency. In both cases exposure dose/target dose relationships, the latter via macromolecule adducts, should be determined.",Excluded,0.9828918
443,"Lung tumour induction in mice after uniform and non-uniform external thoracic X-irradiation The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of the ICRP procedure of using average tissue/organ dose in estimating carcinogenic risk. It has been suggested that highly non-uniform exposure ('hot spots') is much more carcinogenic than an equivalent dose delivered uniformly. In a series of experiments, mice were irradiated with X-rays either uniformly to the thorax or non-uniformly with 72 1-mm microbeams which irradiated approximately 20 per cent of the total lung volume. Two experiments involving uniform irradiation showed a peaked tumour incidence curve with a maximum at 5 Gy. The first 'microbeam' study also produced a pronounced peak in the dose response with a maximum tumour incidence at 1 Gy average lung dose or 5 Gy to the irradiated lung tissue. This implied the use of average tissue dose might underestimate the carcinogenic hazard of non-uniform exposure. Later, more extensive, microbeam experiments failed to replicate this finding. The results were nearly similar to those for uniform irradiation, with a slight increase in tumour incidence from 2.5-5.0 Gy average lung dose. These results imply that for these irradiation conditions the ICRP dose averaging procedure remains valid.",Excluded,0.9828416
99,"Effects of parental radiation exposure on developmental instability in grasshoppers Mutagenic and epigenetic effects of environmental stressors and their transgenerational consequences are of interest to evolutionary biologists because they can amplify natural genetic variation. We studied the effect of parental exposure to radioactive contamination on offspring development in lesser marsh grasshopper Chorthippus albomarginatus. We used a geometric morphometric approach to measure fluctuating asymmetry (FA), wing shape and wing size. We measured time to sexual maturity to check whether parental exposure to radiation influenced offspring developmental trajectory and tested effects of radiation on hatching success and parental fecundity. Wings were larger in early maturing individuals born to parents from high radiation sites compared to early maturing individuals from low radiation sites. As time to sexual maturity increased, wing size decreased but more sharply in individuals from high radiation sites. Radiation exposure did not significantly affect FA or shape in wings nor did it significantly affect hatching success and fecundity. Overall, parental radiation exposure can adversely affect offspring development and fitness depending on developmental trajectories although the cause of this effect remains unclear. We suggest more direct measures of fitness and the inclusion of replication in future studies to help further our understanding of the relationship between developmental instability, fitness and environmental stress.

Method(s): 5 polymorphic gene variants (rs1048943, rs4646421, rs2070676, rs3813867, rs1695) were studied in 399 people living in the East Kazakhstan region in this research. 248 people of the 2nd-3rd generation lived in the territory with radiation exposure in Abai, Borodulikha areas, and 151 people the comparison group lived in Kurchum district without radiation exposure comparable in sex and age with control group. Result(s): The results show that there is a significant association of rs1048943 in exposed and unexposed groups (p < 0.003), and the absence of association of rs4646421, rs2070676, rs3813867, rs1695 in the studied groups. The mean value of thyroxine in carriers of the AG + GG genotype of rs4646421 is significantly lower than in AA genotype carriers (p = 0.04); no significant changes were found in genotypes' distribution with thyroid-stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid peroxidase indicators. Significant changes were in levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase between exposed and unexposed groups (p = 0.007).

620,"Work history and radioprotection practices in relation to cancer incidence and mortality in US radiologic technologists performing nuclear medicine procedures Introduction Technologists working in nuclear medicine (NM) are exposed to higher radiation doses than most other occupationally exposed populations. The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of cancer in NM technologists in relation to work history, procedures performed and radioprotection practices. Methods From the US Radiologic Technologists cohort study, 72 755 radiologic technologists who completed a 2003-2005 questionnaire were followed for cancer mortality through 31 December 2012 and for cancer incidence through completion of a questionnaire in 2012-2013. Multivariable-adjusted models were used to estimate HRs for total cancer incidence and mortality by history of ever performing NM procedures and frequency of performing specific diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and associated radiation protection measures by decade. Results During follow-up (mean=7.5 years), 960 incident cancers and 425 cancer deaths were reported among the 22 360 technologists who worked with NM procedures. We observed no increased risk of cancer incidence (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04) or death (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.19) among workers who ever performed NM procedures. HRs for cancer incidence but not mortality were higher for technologists who began performing therapeutic procedures in 1960 and later compared with the 1950s. Frequency of performing diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and use of radioprotection measures were not consistently associated with cancer risk. No clear associations were observed for specific cancers, but results were based on small numbers. Conclusion Cancer incidence and mortality were not associated with NM work history practices, including greater frequency of procedures performed.Copyright © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

The resultant radiation doses represent less than one per cent of those received by a Northern Ireland individual over a period of 40 years from natural background radiation sources.

There are few studies to clarify neuroendocrine and inflammatory status and the possible consequences particularly in occupational exposure. Aim of the study. Our aim was to associate the redox and inflammatory biomarkers with either nightshift working or occupational radiation exposure, and to compare their levels between the two groups at Alexandria University Hospitals, Alexandria, Egypt. Method(s): We included 150 female nurses at Alexandria University Hospitals: 50 nightshift workers, 50 radiation workers, and 50 dayshift workers as a control group (neither work nightly nor radiation workers). In morning serum sample (7 am), we measured the concentrations of serum melatonin, Cortisol, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by ELISA; malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels colorimetrically, and C-reactive protein (C-RP) levels by turbidimetric method. Result(s): Nightshift workers had significantly lower levels of melatonin and TAC, and higher levels of serum inflammatory markers and cortisol, than day shift control group of workers. Workers occupationally exposed to IR had significantly higher levels of serum melatonin, MDA and inflammatory markers, lower levels of serum cortisol, and lower TAC than day shift workers.

393,"Hapten-specific IgE antibody responses in mice. VI. Selective enhancement of IgE antibody production by low doses of X-irradiation and by cyclophosphamide Exposure of BALB/c, A/J, and (BALB/c X A/J)F1 mice, which are IgE high responder animals, to total body x-irradiation ranging from 50 to 200 R resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of the hapten-specific IgE antibody level as compared to unirradiated control mice. In contrast, anti-hapten antibody responses of the IgG class in these same animals were rarely enhanced, and when so, were of a lesser degree. This relatively selective augmentation of the IgE vs IgG antibody responses was observed in both unprimed and primed mice. By utilizing adoptive transfer systems, it was demonstrated that the enhancing effects of x-irradiation resulted from its action on the carrier-primed cell population and not upon the responding B cells or upon macrophages. The data presented herein suggest that this enhancement phenomenon is the result of the elimination of T cells (or their products) with suppressive functions and that these cells are neither dependent upon nor specific for the carrier antigen employed in the immunization. This hypothesis is given indirect support by the observations that treatment of the same strains of mice with cyclophosphamide, in doses known to abrogate suppressive T cell functions, resulted in a similar enhancing effect to that observed after low doses of x-irradiation. In addition an interesting difference between IgE and IgG precursor B lymphocytes was observed by the ability of IgE B cells to differentiate to the secretory state at a strikingly more rapid rate than IgG B lymphocytes when exposed to comparable T cell helper influences. These observations may provide important clues to the cellular mechanisms of the immune regulation of the IgE response and its relationship to allergic diseases.",Excluded,0.9825211
901,"Bone marrow-derived cells rescue salivary gland function in mice with head and neck irradiation Treatment for most patients with head and neck cancers includes ionizing radiation. A consequence of this treatment is irreversible damage to salivary glands (SGs), which is accompanied by a loss of fluid-secreting acinar-cells and a considerable decrease of saliva output. While there are currently no adequate conventional treatments for this condition, cell-based therapies are receiving increasing attention to regenerate SGs. In this study, we investigated whether bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) can differentiate into salivary epithelial cells and restore SG function in head and neck irradiated mice. BMDCs from male mice were transplanted into the tail-vein of 18 Gy-irradiated female mice. Salivary output was increased in mice that received BMDCs transplantation at week 8 and 24 post-irradiation. At 24 weeks after irradiation (IR), harvested SGs (submandibular and parotid glands) of BMDC-treated mice had greater weights than those of non-treated mice. Histological analysis shows that SGs of treated mice demonstrated an increased level of tissue regenerative activity such as blood vessel formation and cell proliferation, while apoptotic activity was increased in non-transplanted mice. The expression of stem cell markers (Sca-1 or c-kit) was detected in BMDC-treated SGs. Finally, we detected an increased ratio of acinar-cell area and approximately 9% of Y-chromosome-positive (donor-derived) salivary epithelial cells in BMDC-treated mice. We propose here that cell therapy using BMDCs can rescue the functional damage of irradiated SGs by direct differentiation of donor BMDCs into salivary epithelial cells. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

They received radiation therapy with a dose range of 15-74 Gy. The telomere lengths and telomere length distribution in peripheral leukocytes were analyzed by using a Southern blot-based method. Result(s): The telomere length and the telomere length distribution of the peripheral leukocytes did not change after radiation therapy. However, there was a significant proportional decrease in the short telomere fraction (< 4.4 kb) per day and per Gy. Conclusion(s): This observation suggested that the telomere length distribution of peripheral leukocytes could be affected by radiation therapy, and that the effect of radiation tends to appear in cells with short telomeres. Radiation therapy-associated somatic telomere length change within a short range of time, about three months or shorter, can be detected by analyzing the mean telomere length and telomere length distribution. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded,0.98246175
185,"Positive impact of low-dose, high-energy radiation on bone in partial- and/or full-weightbearing mice Astronauts traveling beyond low Earth orbit will be exposed to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR); understanding how high energy ionizing radiation modifies the bone response to mechanical unloading is important to assuring crew health. To investigate this, we exposed 4-mo-old female Balb/cBYJ mice to an acute space-relevant dose of 0.5 Gy 56Fe or sham (n = ~8/group); 4 days later, half of the mice were also subjected to a ground-based analog for 1/6 g (partial weightbearing) (G/6) for 21 days. Microcomputed tomography (-CT) of the distal femur reveals that 56Fe exposure resulted in 6578% greater volume and improved microarchitecture of cancellous bone after 21 d compared to sham controls. Radiation also leads to significant increases in three measures of energy absorption at the mid-shaft femur and an increase in stiffness of the L4 vertebra. No significant effects of radiation on bone formation indices are detected; however, G/6 leads to reduced % mineralizing surface on the inner mid-tibial bone surface. In separate groups allowed 21 days of weightbearing recovery from G/6 and/or 56Fe exposure, radiation-exposed mice still exhibit greater bone mass and improved microarchitecture vs. sham control. However, femoral bone energy absorption values are no longer higher in the 56Fe-exposed WB mice vs. sham controls. We provide evidence for persistent positive impacts of high-LET radiation exposure preceding a period of full or partial weightbearing on bone mass and microarchitecture in the distal femur and, for full weightbearing mice only and more transiently, cortical bone energy absorption values. 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.9821732
278,"Apoptosis, ageing and cancer susceptibility We have previously shown that peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from individuals carrying a germline TP53 mutation show a dramatically reduced apoptotic response to radiation. As part of a study of this phenomenon, we also investigated apoptotic response in a series of breast cancer patients lacking TP53 mutations and in a control group of individuals without cancer. There was a significant reduction in mean apoptotic response with increasing age in all groups. These findings are consistent with a number of studies in rodents, which have demonstrated a reduction in DNA damage-induced apoptosis with increasing age. In addition, after adjusting for age, breast cancer patients showed significantly reduced apoptotic responses compared with normal controls (P=0.002). The odds ratio for breast cancer in women with an apoptotic response of <35%, compared with women with a response of >49%, was 6.42 (95% CI 1.68-24.6). The data further support the hypothesis that a reduction in apoptotic response to DNA damage with increasing age may play a significant role in the age-related increase in cancer.",Excluded,0.9821685
634,"Pathogenetic mechanisms in immune polioencephalomyelitis: induction of disease in immunosuppressed mice Immune polioencephalomyelitis (IPE) was induced by the i.p. injection of x-irradiated (10, 000 R) syngeneic line Ib malignant lymphocytes into C58 mice that were 7 or more months old and in young mice immunosuppressed by x-ray or drugs. The occurrence of IPE in young immunosuppressed C58 mice was systematically analyzed. When mice less than 2 weeks old were x-irradiated with 600 R, IPE could not be induced. The incidence in 1-month-old mice was approximately 50% and increased progressively with the age except for a drop in incidence at 3 months. An analysis of the dose effects of x-irradiation on the occurrence of IPE in mice of different ages revealed a marked increase in the incidence in 3- and 5-month-old mice beginning at dose levels of 450 R and 300 R, respectively. Considered together, these data indicated that two subpopulations of immunocytes differing in x-ray sensitivity interacted to protect mice from IPE. It appears that under natural conditions an x-ray sensitive cell population, possibly having suppressor function, decreased with age and made mice susceptible ot induction of IPE. Five-month-old mice were immunosuppressed with an LD10 of cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, or methotrexate to determine whether mice immunosuppressed with drugs also were susceptible to the induction of IPE. The incidence was 89%, 13%, and 5%, respectively. The mouse strain specificity of IPE induction also was studied. In 6- to 8-month-old mice suppressed with 600 R, IPE could not be induced in non-H-2k strains: BALB, C57BL/6, NZB. Of the H-2K strains tested (CBA/J, C3H/He, AKR/J, C58), the disease could be induced only in the C58 and AKR/J strains. Histopathologic studies showed that CNS lesions in immunosuppressed C58 and AKR/J mice did not differ significantly from those in old C58 mice with IPE. Taken together, the results of these studies indicate that IPE can be used as a model for analyzing age-dependent diseases of suspected immunopathologic etiology.",Excluded,0.98213756
691,"Cumulative ionizing radiation to image the small bowel: Are we really exceeding the safety limits? Introduction: Radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging of the small bowel is common in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. Increased risk of malignancy has been associated with radiation exposure. For solid cancers this follows a linear-no-threshold model. Current data (BEIR VII) demonstrates that exposure to 100mGY to population of mixed ages, the life time attributable risk (LAR) of solid organ malignancy is 8 per 1000 of exposed persons for males and 13.1 per 1000 for females. This varies according to age of exposure exposure to 100mGY at age 10 confers a risk of 1.33% for males (2.53% for females); at age 30 this is 0.6% for males (1% for females) and at age 50 it is 0.51% for males (0.68% for females). 100mGY exposure confers a LAR (in a linear-quadratic model) for leukaemia of 1 per 1000 for males and 0.72 per 1000 for females. This varies from 1.2 per 1000 exposed males at age 10 (0.86 for females) to 0.84 per 1000 males exposed at age 30 (0.49 for females). The risk remains the same for males aged 50 and decreases to 0.30 per 1000 females exposed aged 50. Aim and Method: Aim: To determine the cumulative ionizing radiation exposure in mGY secondary to non-acute small bowel (SB) imaging in CD patients. Method(s): Patients were identified from our database. Their SB investigations were extracted. Radiation exposure for the procedures was obtained from the Physics division of the radiology department. Result(s): 80 CD patients (males 42 patient) were identified. The time since the diagnosis of CD varied from 41 years to 5 months (mean 8.6 years). 56 patients (30 males) were exposed to ionizing radiation to image the SB. Table 1 denotes the total number of exposures per age group and gender. 15 male and 5 female patients had SB stricturing disease. 2 female patients had fistulising SB disease. Table 2 demonstrates cumulative ionizing radiation secondary to non-acute small bowel imaging. Conclusion(s): 70% of the CD patients were exposed to diagnostic ionizing radiation as to image the small bowel. This radiation exposure reached more than 50mGY in 15% of patients and more than 100mGY in 8.75% our Study group. These results demonstrate the high ionizing radiation with the possible consequences that CD patients are exposed to throughout their lifetime. Thus we suggest that efforts should be done to image the small bowel by non-ionizing radiation such as MRI. In places where this is not available the request for ionizing radiation should only be done by specialists in close liason with the radiologists. (Table presented).",Excluded,0.98206145
564,"Combining paratransgenesis with SIT: impact of ionizing radiation on the DNA copy number of Sodalis glossinidius in tsetse flies BACKGROUND: Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are the cyclical vectors of the causative agents of African Trypanosomosis, which has been identified as a neglected tropical disease in both humans and animals in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa. The sterile insect technique (SIT) has shown to be a powerful method to manage tsetse fly populations when used in the frame of an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) program. To date, the release of sterile males to manage tsetse fly populations has only been implemented in areas to reduce transmission of animal African Trypanosomosis (AAT). The implementation of the SIT in areas with Human African Trypanosomosis (HAT) would require additional measures to eliminate the potential risk associated with the release of sterile males that require blood meals to survive and hence, might contribute to disease transmission. Paratransgenesis offers the potential to develop tsetse flies that are refractory to trypanosome infection by modifying their associated bacteria (Sodalis glossinidius) here after referred to as Sodalis. Here we assessed the feasibility of combining the paratransgenesis approach with SIT by analyzing the impact of ionizing radiation on the copy number of Sodalis and the vectorial capacity of sterilized tsetse males., RESULTS: Adult Glossina morsitans morsitans that emerged from puparia irradiated on day 22 post larviposition did not show a significant decline in Sodalis copy number as compared with non-irradiated flies. Conversely, the Sodalis copy number was significantly reduced in adults that emerged from puparia irradiated on day 29 post larviposition and in adults irradiated on day 7 post emergence. Moreover, irradiating 22-day old puparia reduced the copy number of Wolbachia and Wigglesworthia in emerged adults as compared with non-irradiated controls, but the radiation treatment had no significant impact on the vectorial competence of the flies., CONCLUSION: Although the radiation treatment significantly reduced the copy number of some tsetse fly symbionts, the copy number of Sodalis recovered with time in flies irradiated as 22-day old puparia. This recovery offers the opportunity to combine a paratransgenesis approach - using modified Sodalis to produce males refractory to trypanosome infection - with the release of sterile males to minimize the risk of disease transmission, especially in HAT endemic areas. Moreover, irradiation did not increase the vector competence of the flies for trypanosomes.",Excluded,0.98189557
1040,"Dose-dependent influence of genetic polymorphisms on DNA damage induced by styrene oxide, ethylene oxide and gamma-radiation Styrene oxide (SO), ethylene oxide (EO) and gamma-radiation (G) are agents with a well-described metabolism and genotoxicity. EPHX1 and GSTs play an important role in the detoxification of electrophiles and oxidative stress. Enzymes involved in base excision repair (hOGG1, XRCC1), in rejoining single strand breaks (XRCC1) and in repair of cross-links and chromosomal double strand breaks (XRCC3) might have an impact on genotoxicity as well. In this study we assessed the dose-dependent effect of genetic polymorphisms in biotransforming (EPHX (Tyr113/His113 and His139/Arg139), GSTP1 (Ile105/Val105), GSTM1 and GSTT1) and DNA repair enzymes (hOGG1 (Ser326/Cys326), XRCC1 (Arg194/Trp194, Arg280/His280, Arg399/Gln399), XRCC3 (Thr241/Met241)) on the induced genotoxicity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 20 individuals were exposed to 3 doses per agent (+control). Genotoxicity was evaluated by measuring comet tail length (TL) and micronucleus frequencies in binucleated cells (MNCB). Dose-dependent DNA damage was found for all agents and end-points, with the exception of MNCB induced by EO. Repeated measure ANOVA revealed a significant contribution of hOGG1 and XRCC3 genotypes to the inter-individual variability of TL and MNCB in cells exposed to EO and G. Homozygous hOGG1326 wild cells showed significantly lower EO-induced TL than the heterozygous cells. Significantly higher TL and MNCB were found in EO-exposed cells carrying the XRCC3(241)Met variant and the influence on TL was more pronounced at higher dose. In G-irradiated cells, TL was significantly higher in the hOGG1326 homozygous wild types compared with mutated genotypes. The influence of hOGG1326 on TL was borderline dose-dependent. We conclude that the influence of genetic polymorphisms of enzymes involved in DNA repair on induced genotoxicity depends on exposure dose.",Excluded,0.98182434
64,"Biodosimetry for high dose accidental exposures by drug induced premature chromosome condensation (PCC) assay The conventional dicentric assay does not provide an accurate dose estimate in the case of accidental exposure to ionizing radiation above 6 Gy due to mitotic delay and poor mitotic index. The present study aims to establish a simple and rapid dose assessment technique based on scoring of rings and fragments in PCC spreads of stimulated lymphocytes. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were gamma irradiated to different doses (6.2-24.5 Gy), cultured for two days with PHA and were forced to condense prematurely using 500 nM Okadaic acid (OA). The chromosome spreads were prepared, stained with Giemsa and observed under a microscope. The PCC index, PCC rings, and PCC fragments were scored for each dose point to arrive at the dose effect curve for various end points such as induction of rings and fragments and dicentrics. The PCC index varied from 12-18% up to 18 Gy and thereafter dropped to 6-8% at higher doses. The dose dependent increase in rings and fragments was found to be linear with a slope of 0.054+/-0.001 Gy(-1) for rings and 0.45+/-0.03 Gy(-1) for PCC fragments. An experiment was carried out to simulate partial-body exposure by mixing 10 Gy in vitro irradiated blood with un-irradiated blood in different proportions. The ratio of frequency of damaged cells among the total number of cells analyzed was found to be a good index of partial-body exposure. The culture duration was extended to 72 h to overcome the cell cycle delay induced by high doses of radiation. The conventional dicentrics rings and fragments also showed a dose response at high doses. The response can be best fitted to a linear model with a slope of 0.28+/-0.0007 Gy(-1) for the induction of dicentrics. However, long culture duration, technical skill and time required to analyse multi-aberrant cells makes the dicentric assay less suitable for high dose exposures requiring a rapid dose estimate. The PCC assay can be performed in 50 h with biodosimetric information about the irradiated fraction in cases of acute radiation exposures. The automated finding of PCC spreads significantly increased the speed of scoring PCC fragments. Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.9818133
853,"Dramatic and prolonged decrease of whole salivary secretion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy Objectives. This study evaluates: (1) the change in whole salivary secretion rates of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients before, during, and after radiotherapy, especially during the first week of irradiation; (2) the recovery capability of salivary glands up to 2 years postirradiation; and (3) the possible prognostic factors affecting salivary gland functions. Study design. Fifty patients who completed conventional radiotherapy using either once-per-day or hyperfractionated technique were included. Both unstimulated and stimulated whole salivary flow rates and ratios (flow rate compared with baseline) were measured before, during, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years after radiotherapy. Multivariate analysis of potential prognostic factors affecting the salivary secretion ratio was made. Results. Salivary glands were very radiosensitive and responded to radiation very early. After 720 cGy at the fourth day of the 8-week treatment, the unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates had decreased by 40%-50%. The nadir was reached in many patients after 3600 cGy (4 weeks). A second phase of decrease in salivary secretion was noted after completion of radiotherapy. Conclusions. Different mechanisms may be responsible for salivary response after low and high dose of radiation. This study shows no recovery of salivary secretion during the follow-up period, and the best strategy for managing radiation-induced salivary gland damage may be reduction of radiation dose to the glands. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

656,"The role of age, sex and steroid sex hormones in radiation cataractogenesis It is critical to identify and gain a better understanding of the factors that enhance or reduce the risk of cataractogenesis, to minimize the possibility of occurrence after deliberate (e.g., radiation therapy, interplanetary travel) or unintentional exposure to ionizing radiation. Both gender and age at the time of exposure have been established as key determinants of cataractogenesis induced by sparsely ionizing (low-LET) and densely ionizing (high-LET) radiation. However, animal data from several older studies are often conflicting and somewhat difficult to interpret, in that the experiments suffered from small group sizes, limited dose ranges or short periods of observation, and human data are sparse or statistical significance is sometimes limited. Steroid sex hormones (SSH) may underlie age and gender-based differences in the progression and prevalence of cataracts that otherwise occur spontaneously in humans and animal models, and may also underlie age and sex-related differences in radiation cataractogenesis. Here, we review data that have aided in our understanding of the role of age, sex and steroid sex hormones in radiation cataractogenesis. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.9816175
361,"Protective Effects of Magnesium Sulfate on Radiation Induced Brain Injury in Rats OBJECTIVES: The effect of magnesium sulfate on brain tissue of SD rats irradiated by 6MeV electron was investigated., METHODS: SD rats were divided into three groups: control group, irradiation (IR group) and irradiation treated with magnesium sulfate (IR+M group). After being anesthetized, the whole brains of IR group and IR+M group were exposed to 6 MeV electron radiation. IR+M group was i.p. injected with 10% magnesium sulfate (400 mg/kg) one day before radiation and three days and five days after radiation. And on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th day after radiation, SD rats were euthanatized to take brain tissue for the detection of calcium, redox status and cell apoptosis, as well as the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1., RESULTS: The results indicated that magnesium treatment may alleviate the elevation of calcium and enhance redox status through increasing the activities of superoxide dimutase (SOD) and myeloperodase (MPO), and decreasing the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). Tunnel and immunohistochemistry assay suggested that treatment with magnesium decreased the apoptosis rate of brain cells and the expressions of caspase-3, respectively. Decline of the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 protein was observed after the treatment of magnesium., CONCLUSION: All the results demonstrated that magnesium may elicit protective effect against radiationinduced brain injury by reducing calcium overload, improving redox and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Moreover, magnesium significantly down-regulated the protein or mRNA levels of NF-kappaB and ICAM- 1. The findings may provide references for the application of magnesium in clinic for brain injury induced by radiation.

776,"[Clinical significance of low-dose CT performed for three consecutive years in diagnosis of lung nodules in coal mine workers with 20 working years] Objective: To investigate the clinical significance of low-dose CT (LDCT) in coal mine workers with relatively long working years. Methods: A total of 907 coal mine workers with >=20 working years were enrolled, among whom there were 863 male and 44 female workers with a mean age of 49.5 years. Digital radiography (DR) was performed for these workers in 2013, and LDCT was performed for three consecutive years from 2014 to 2016. Results: A total of 32 workers were found to have lung nodules by DR in 2013, while in 2014, 269 workers were found to have non-calcified lung nodules by LDCT, and there was a significant difference in the number of workers with lung nodules (chi(2)=233.73, P<0.005) . There was also a significant difference in the detection rate of nodules between the workers with different working years of dust exposure (chi(2)=6.648, P=0.00) . The male workers had a significantly higher detection rate of nodules than the female workers (chi(2)=5.690, P=0.017) . There was no significant difference in the number of nodules between workers with different types of work (chi(2)=16.985, P=0.05) . There were 443 lung nodules in total, among which 71.56% were solid nodules and 55.75% had a size of <=4mm; malignant nodules were confirmed by surgery in 6 (0.66%) of the 907 workers after baseline LDCT. LDCT reexamination in 2015 and 2016 found new nodules in 8 workers and enlarged nodules in 3 workers, and there was no significant change in the number of nodules with a size of <=4 mm. Conclusions: It is necessary to perform high-risk population screening for coal mine workers by LDCT. The follow-up strategies for nodules with a size of <=4mm are the same as those for negative results; annual reexamination is recommended for nodules with a size of >4-8 mm, and clinical treatment should be considered for nodules with a size of >8 mm.",Excluded,0.9813757

The hazard functions (age-specific risks) for incidence of lung, bone and liver tumors were modeled as a function of cumulative radiation dose, and estimates of lifetime risks based on the combined data were developed. For lung tumors, linear-quadratic functions provided an adequate fit to the data from both laboratories, and linear functions provided an adequate fit when analyses were restricted to doses less than 20 Gy. The estimated risk coefficients for these functions were significantly larger when based on ITRI data compared to PNNL data, and dosimetry biases are a possible explanation for this difference. There was also evidence that the bone tumor response functions differed for the two laboratories, although these differences occurred primarily at high doses. These functions were clearly nonlinear (even when restricted to average skeletal doses less than 1 Gy), and evidence of radiation-induced bone tumors was found for doses less than 0.5 Gy in both laboratories. Liver tumor risks were similar for the two laboratories, and linear functions provided an adequate fit to these data. Lifetime risk estimates for lung and bone tumors derived from these data had wide confidence intervals, but were consistent with estimates currently used in radiation protection. The dog-based lifetime liver tumor risk estimate was an order of magnitude larger than that used in radiation protection, but the latter also carries large uncertainties. The application of common statistical methodology to data from two studies has allowed the identification of differences in these studies and has provided a basis for common risk estimates based on both data sets.",Excluded,0.9810574

335,"Harderian Gland Tumorigenesis: Low-Dose and LET Response Increased cancer risk remains a primary concern for travel into deep space and may preclude manned missions to Mars due to large uncertainties that currently exist in estimating cancer risk from the spectrum of radiations found in space with the very limited available human epidemiological radiation-induced cancer data. Existing data on human risk of cancer from X-ray and gamma-ray exposure must be scaled to the many types and fluences of radiations found in space using radiation quality factors and dose-rate modification factors, and assuming linearity of response since the shapes of the dose responses at low doses below 100 mSv are unknown. The goal of this work was to reduce uncertainties in the relative biological effect (RBE) and linear energy transfer (LET) relationship for space-relevant doses of charged-particle radiation-induced carcinogenesis. The historical data from the studies of Fry et al. and Alpen et al. for Harderian gland (HG) tumors in the female CB6F1 strain of mouse represent the most complete set of experimental observations, including dose dependence, available on a specific radiation-induced tumor in an experimental animal using heavy ion beams that are found in the cosmic radiation spectrum. However, these data lack complete information on low-dose responses below 0.1 Gy, and for chronic low-dose-rate exposures, and there are gaps in the LET region between 25 and 190 keV/mum. In this study, we used the historical HG tumorigenesis data as reference, and obtained HG tumor data for 260 MeV/u silicon (LET ~70 keV/mum) and 1,000 MeV/u titanium (LET ~100 keV/mum) to fill existing gaps of data in this LET range to improve our understanding of the dose-response curve at low doses, to test for deviations from linearity and to provide RBE estimates. Animals were also exposed to five daily fractions of 0.026 or 0.052 Gy of 1,000 MeV/u titanium ions to simulate chronic exposure, and HG tumorigenesis from this fractionated study were compared to the results from single 0.13 or 0.26 Gy acute titanium exposures.

740,"Acute vasculitis after endovascular brachytherapy PURPOSE: Angioplasty effectively relieves coronary artery stenosis but is often followed by restenosis. Endovascular radiation (beta or gamma) at the time of angioplasty prevents restenosis in a large proportion of vessels in swine (short term) and humans (short and long term). Little information is available about the effects of this radiation exposure beyond the wall of the coronary arteries., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Samples were obtained from 76 minipigs in the course of several experiments designed to evaluate endovascular brachytherapy: 76 of 114 coronary arteries and 6 of 12 iliac arteries were exposed to endovascular radiation from 32P sources (35 Gy at 0.5 mm from the intima). Two-thirds of the vessels had angioplasty or stenting. The vessels were systematically examined either at 28 days or at 6 months after radiation., RESULTS: We found an unexpected lesion: acute necrotizing vasculitis in arterioles located < or =2.05 mm from the target artery. It was characterized by fibrinoid necrosis of the wall, often associated with lymphocytic exudates or thrombosis. Based on the review of perpendicular sections of tissue samples, the arterioles had received between 6 and 40 Gy. This arteriolar vasculitis occurred at 28 days in samples from 51% of irradiated coronary arteries and 100% of irradiated iliac arteries. By 6 months, the incidence of acute vasculitis decreased to 24% around the coronary arteries. However, at that time, healing vasculitis was evident, often with luminal narrowing, in 46% of samples. Vasculitis was not seen in any of 44 samples from unirradiated vessels (0%) and had no relation to angioplasty, stenting, or their sequelae. This radiation-associated vasculitis in the swine resembles the localized lymphocytic vasculitis that we have reported in tissues of humans exposed to external radiation. On the other hand, it is quite different from the various types of systemic vasculitis that occur in nonirradiated humans., CONCLUSION: Endoarterial brachytherapy using 32P results in vascular effects beyond the adventitia of the target vessel. This necrotizing vasculitis is causally related to radiation, but its mechanism is unclear and a dose effect is not evident. Quite possibly, local upregulation of inflammatory cytokines contributes to this radiation-associated vasculitis, which only involved some of the arterioles in each sample. It is likely that radiation-associated vasculitis also occurs around human coronary arteries and may result in foci of ischemia. To our knowledge, this lesion has not been previously recognized, either in experimental models or in human specimens examined after angioplasty/brachytherapy.",Excluded,0.9797549
302,"Irradiation induced inversions suppress recombination between the M locus and morphological markers in Aedes aegypti Background: Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of arthropod-borne viruses and one of the most widespread and invasive mosquito species. Due to the lack of efficient specific drugs or vaccination strategies, vector population control methods, such as the sterile insect technique, are receiving renewed interest. However, availability of a reliable genetic sexing strategy is crucial, since there is almost zero tolerance for accidentally released females. Development of genetic sexing strains through classical genetics is hindered by genetic recombination that is not suppressed in males as is the case in many Diptera. Isolation of naturally-occurring or irradiation-induced inversions can enhance the genetic stability of genetic sexing strains developed through genetically linking desirable phenotypes with the male determining region. Result(s): For the induction and isolation of inversions through irradiation, 200 male pupae of the 'BRA' wild type strain were irradiated at 30 Gy and 100 isomale lines were set up by crossing with homozygous 'red-eye' (re) mutant females. Recombination between re and the M locus and the white (w) gene (causing a recessive white eye phenotype when mutated) and the M locus was tested in 45 and 32 lines, respectively. One inversion (Inv35) reduced recombination between both re and the M locus, and wand the M locus, consistent with the presence of a rather extended inversion between the two morphological mutations, that includes the M locus. Another inversion (Inv5) reduced recombination only between w and the M locus. In search of naturally-occurring, recombination-suppressing inversions, homozygous females from the red eye and the white eye strains were crossed with seventeen and fourteen wild type strains collected worldwide, representing either recently colonized or long-established laboratory populations. Despite evidence of varying frequencies of recombination, no combination led to the elimination or substantial reduction of recombination. Conclusion(s): Inducing inversions through irradiation is a feasible strategy to isolate recombination suppressors either on the M or the m chromosome for Aedes aegypti. Such inversions can be incorporated in genetic sexing strains developed through classical genetics to enhance their genetic stability and support SIT or other approaches that aim to population suppression through male-delivered sterility.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.9796964

We also investigated the possibility of expanding ex vivo the residual progenitors exposed to different dose levels of TBI., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight patients treated for AML (n = 3) and myeloma (n = 5) were included. BM and PB samples were harvested before TBI and after doses of: 5 Gy. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were assayed for burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), granulocyte-forming unit macrophage (CFU-GM), and long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-ICs). Ex vivo expansion: MNCs (after irradiation and controls) were suspended in long-term cultures and expanded with a combination of five cytokines., RESULTS: CD34+ cells were detectable at 10 Gy. We observed a significant decrease of CFU-GM and BFU-E, respectively, to 13.5% and 8.5% of baseline values for doses <or=2 Gy and to 8.2% and 4.6% for doses ranging between 2.1 and 5 Gy. No dose effect was observed for residual MNCs. LTC-ICs were not detectable after 0.8 Gy. The expansion was not successful after 1.2 Gy., CONCLUSION: This study confirms the significant decrease of human mature and immature progenitors in BM and PB immediately after low-dose TBI. In addition, the lack of expansion suggests that autografting using BM or PB residual stem cells collected and expanded in vitro in case of accidental whole body exposure may be impractical.",Excluded,0.9796937
1090,"Is it possible to avoid hypopituitarism after the irradiation of pituitary adenomas by the Leksell gamma-knife? Radiation therapy is used in the treatment of pituitary adenomas, especially in failures of neurosurgery and pharmacotherapy to reduce the size of adenomas and normalize their hypersecretion. Conventional fractionated radiotherapy has achieved good results, but only after a long latency, with considerable postradiation morbidity and with very frequent appearance of hypopituitarism. The focal stereotactic targeting allowed by Leksell gamma-knife (LGK) was supposed to decrease the incidence of hypopituitarism, however our first patients treated by LGK developed hypopituitarism in 38.2%. Consequently, we have analyzed factors leading to this unfavorable outcome and suggested that the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary tissue is the most important cause of hypopituitarism. Result(s): Seventy-five patients (47 women and 28 men) with pituitary adenomas (39 with acromegaly, 17 prolactinomas, 8 with Cushing's disease, 1 with Nelson's syndrome and 9 functionless adenomas), where the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary tissue was measured, were followed 60-180 (mean 91.1) months. In 41 patients, the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary was more than 15 Gy. The hypopituitarism at least in one axis developed in 29 (70.7%) patients during 10-126 months after the irradiation. In 34 patients, the mean dose on pituitary was less than 15 Gy. Only one patient (1.2%) developed hypopituitarism 12 months after the irradiation. This patient had undergone two previous pituitary surgeries and had already central hypothyreosis when irradiated. Conclusion(s): To avoid hypopituitarism the radiation dose of 15 Gy is the maximum safe limit of the mean dose of radiation to the pituitary tissue surrounding the adenoma. This cut off should become a rule when irradiating pituitary adenomas - just like the dose rules of 7 Gy on the optical tract or 14 Gy on the brainstem.",Excluded,0.9794732
246,"DNA-protein crosslinks as a biomarker of exposure to solar radiation: a preliminary study in brick-kiln workers In India, fired clay bricks are produced in small-scale factories. There are 60, 000 active brick kilns, providing employment to nearly 12 million people in different suboccupations. This industry is largely non-mechanized and operates from November to June. Almost all the workers are exposed to direct sunlight for 8-10 h a day. Cellular DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are the biologically active nucleoprotein complexes formed between DNA and proteins. Ultraviolet light and gamma-rays, and other suspected carcinogens in humans, induce DPC formation in blood cells. DPCs have therefore been identified as a biomarker for monitoring exposure to these hazardous agents. Here we report steady-state levels of DPCs in human peripheral lymphocytes from 46 brick-kiln workers exposed occupationally for 8-10 h a day to solar radiation in brickfields and 25 unexposed controls. A significant increase (p <0.05) in DPC content and DPC coefficients in peripheral lymphocytes was observed in the brick-kiln workers compared with the controls. The data suggest that the DPC content of lymphocytes could be a possible biomarker of exposure to solar radiation. However, further work is necessary to confirm this.",Excluded,0.9790399
183,"Cancer incidence and mortality in populations living near uranium milling and mining operations in grants, New Mexico, 1950-2004 In a previous cohort study of workers engaged in uranium milling and mining activities near Grants, Cibola County, New Mexico, we found lung cancer mortality to be significantly increased among underground miners. Uranium mining took place from early in the 1950s to 1990, and the Grants Uranium Mill operated from 1958-1990. The present study evaluates cancer mortality during 1950-2004 and cancer incidence during 1982-2004 among county residents. Standardized mortality (SMR) and incidence (SIR) ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed, with observed numbers of cancer deaths and cases compared to expected values based on New Mexico cancer rates. The total numbers of cancer deaths and incident cancers were close to that expected (SMR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07; SIR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.02). Lung cancer mortality and incidence were significantly increased among men (SMR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21; SIR 1.40, 95% CI 1.18-1.64) but not women (SMR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85-1.10; SIR 1.01, 95% CI 0.78-1.29). Similarly, among the population of the three census tracts near the Grants Uranium Mill, lung cancer mortality was significantly elevated among men (SMR 1.57; 95% CI 1.21-1.99) but not women (SMR 1.12; 95% CI 0.75-1.61). Except for an elevation in mortality for stomach cancer among women (SMR 1.30; 95% CI 1.03-1.63), which declined over the 55-year observation period, no significant increases in SMRs or SIRs for 22 other cancers were found. Although etiological inferences cannot be drawn from these ecological data, the excesses of lung cancer among men seem likely to be due to previously reported risks among underground miners from exposure to radon gas and its decay products. Smoking, socioeconomic factors or ethnicity may also have contributed to the lung cancer excesses observed in our study. The stomach cancer increase was highest before the uranium mill began operation and then decreased to normal levels. With the exception of male lung cancer, this study provides no clear or consistent evidence that the operation of uranium mills and mines adversely affected cancer incidence or mortality of county residents.",Excluded,0.97877264
937,"Factors influencing the release of volatiles in Anastrepha obliqua males (Diptera: Tephritidae) During sexual signaling, males of Anastrepha obliqua (Macquart) form leks and attract females by producing sounds and releasing volatile compounds. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence time of time of day, age, irradiation, mating status, and the presence of host fruit on the release of volatile components by laboratory-reared A. obliqua males. A. obliqua males released four compounds identified by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as (E,E)-alpha-farnesene, (Z,E)-alpha-farnesene, (Z)-3-nonenol, and a farnesene isomer during calling behavior. Although males released volatiles during the entire day, the amount of volatiles was higher in the early morning and afternoon hours. Males began to emit volatiles when they were 6 d old, but only the amount of (Z)-3-nonenol was affected by age. Irradiation of flies with gamma rays from a 60Co source at a dose rate of 80 [corrected] Gy significantly reduced the amount of volatiles released during calling behavior. The amount of volatiles was lower in recently mated males than virgin males. However, there were no significant differences between virgin males and males 24 h after mating.

732,"Occupational cancer in central European countries The countries of central Europe, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, suffer from environmental and occupational health problems created during the political system in place until the late 1980s. This situation is reflected by data on workplace exposure to hazardous agents. Such data have been systematically collected in Skovakia and the Czech Republic since 1977. The data presented describe mainly the situation in the early 1990s. The number of workers exposed to risk factors at the workplace represent about 10% of the working population in Slovakia and 30% in Poland. In Slovakia in 1992 the percentage of persons exposed to chemical substances was 16.4%, to ionizing radiation 4.3%, and to carcinogens 3.3% of all workers exposed to risk factors. The total number of persons exposed to substances proven to be carcinogens in Poland was 1.3% of the employees; 2.2% were exposed to the suspected carcinogens. The incidence of all certified occupational diseases in the Slovak Republic was 53 per 100,000 insured employees in 1992. Cancers certified as occupational cancers are skin cancer caused by occupational exposure to carcinogens, lung cancer caused by ionizing radiation, and asbestosis together with lung cancer. Specific information on occupational cancers from Romania and Bulgaria was not available for this paper. It is difficult to predict a trend for future incidences of occupational cancer. Improved control technology, governmental regulatory activity to reduce exposure, surveillance of diseases and risk factors, and vigilant use of preventive measures should, however, ultimately reduce occupational cancer.",Excluded,0.9783851

146,"The role of thiols in cellular response to radiation and drugs Cellular nonprotein thiols (NPSH) consist of glutathione (GSH) and other low molecular weight species such as cysteine, cysteamine, and coenzyme A. GSH is usually less than the total cellular NPSH, and with thiol reactive agents, such as diethyl maleate (DEM), its rate of depletion is in part dependent upon the cellular capacity for its resynthesis. If resynthesis is blocked by buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine(BSO), the NPSH, including GSH, is depleted more rapidly, Cellular thiol depletion by diamide, N-ethylmaleimide, and BSO may render oxygenated cells more sensitive to radiation. These cells may or may not show a reduction in the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER). Human A549 lung carcinoma cells depleted of their NPSH either by prolonged culture or by BSO treatment do not show a reduced OER but do show increased aerobic responses to radiation. Some nitroheterocyclic radiosensitizing drugs also deplete cellular thiols under aerobic conditions. Such reactivity may be the reason that they show anomalous radiation sensitization (i.e., better than predicted on the basis of electron affinity). Other nitrocompounds, such as misonidazole, are activated under hypoxic conditions to radical intermediates. When cellular thiols are depleted peroxide is formed. Under hypoxic conditions thiols are depleted because metabolically reduced intermediates react with GSH instead of oxygen. Thiol depletion, under hypoxic conditions, may be the reason that misonidazole and other nitrocompounds show an extra enhancement ratio with hypoxic cells. Thiol depletion by DEM or BSO alters the radiation response of hypoxic cells to misonidazole. In conclusion, we propose an altered thiol model which includes a mechanism for thiol involvement in the aerobic radiation response of cells. This mechanism involves both thiol-linked hydrogen donation to oxygen radical adducts to produce hydroperoxides followed by a GSH peroxidase-catalyzed reduction of the hydroperoxides to intermediates entering into metabolic pathways to produce the original molecule.",Excluded,0.9775663
983,"Celecoxib and radioresistant glioblastoma-derived CD133+ cells: Improvement in radiotherapeutic effects. Laboratory investigation Object. Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor, has a poor prognosis, even with aggressive resection and chemoradiotherapy. Recent studies indicate that CD133+ cells play a key role in radioresistance and recurrence of glioblastoma. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, is overexpressed in a variety of tumors, including CD133+ glioblastomas. The COX-2-derived prostaglandins promote neovascularization during tumor development, and conventional radiotherapy increases the proportion of CD133+ cells rather than eradicating them. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in enhancing the therapeutic effects of radiation on CD133+ glioblastomas. Methods. Cells positive for CD133 were isolated from glioblastoma specimens and characterized by flow cytometry, then treated with celecoxib and/or ionizing radiation (IR). Clonogenic assay, cell irradiation, cell cycle analysis, Western blot, and xenotransplantation were used to assess the effects of celecoxib alone, IR alone, and IR with celecoxib on CD133+ and CD133- glioblastoma cells. Three separate xenotransplantation experiments were carried out using 310 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice: 1) an initial tumorigenicity evaluation in which 3 different quantities of untreated CD133- cells or untreated or pretreated CD133+ cells (5 treatment conditions) from 7 different tumors were injected into the striatum of 2 mice (210 mice total); 2) a tumor growth study (50 mice); and 3) a survival study (50 mice). For these last 2 studies the same 5 categories of cells were used as in the tumorigenicity (untreated CD133 - cells, untreated or pretreated CD133+ cells, with pretreatment consisting of celecoxib alone, IR alone, or IR and celecoxib), but only 1 cell source (Case 2) and quantity (5 x 104 cells) were used. Results. High levels of COX-2 protein were detected in the CD133 + but not the CD133- glioblastoma cells. The authors further demonstrated that 30 mM celecoxib was able to effectively enhance the IR effect in inhibiting colony formation and increasing IR-mediated apoptosis in celecoxib-treated CD133+ glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, reduction in radioresistance was correlated with the induction of G2/M arrest, which was partially mediated through the increase in the level of phosphorylated-cdc2. In vivo xenotransplant analysis further confirmed that CD133+-associated tumorigenicity was significantly suppressed by celecoxib treatment. Importantly, pretreatment of CD133+ glioblastoma cells with a combination of celecoxib and IR before injection into the striatum of SCID mice resulted in a statistically significant reduction in tumor growth and a statistically significant increase in the mean survival rate of the mice. Conclusions. Celecoxib combined with radiation plays a critical role in the suppression of growth of CD133+ glioblastoma stemlike cells. Celecoxib is therefore a radiosensitizing drug for clinical application in glioblastoma.",Excluded,0.97701216
239,"Changes in the Selected Antioxidant Defense Parameters in the Blood of Patients after High Resolution Computed Tomography Ionizing radiation generated during high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning may have an indirect effect on the mechanisms regulating the oxidative-antioxidant balance in the human body, which is one of the necessary factors ensuring the maintenance of its homeostasis. The aim of the study was to analyze the response of antioxidant systems through the determination of the antioxidant markers in the blood of patients exposed to oxidative stress resulting from the routine HRCT examination of the chest. Blood of 35 people aged 60.77 +/- 10.81 taken before and at four time points after the examination constituted the test material. The determination of the total antioxidant capacity expressed as ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and ferric reducing antioxidant activity and ascorbic acid concentration (FRASC) were performed together with an examination of catalase activity and the concentration of the reduced glutathione. The organism's response to ionizing radiation was associated with a significant decrease in the antioxidant markers' levels at all time-points and showed a significant negative correlation depending on the radiation dose. Visible down-regulation of these markers is a response to increased oxidative stress.

The present study was undertaken to ascertain its ability to protect against gamma radiation-induced damage. Acute toxicity of the drug was studied taking 24-h, 72-h and 30-day mortality after a single intraperitoneal injection of 400-1200 mg/kg body weight (b.wt.) of the drug. The drug LD(50) for 24- and 72-h/30-day survival were found to be 933 and 676 mg/kg b.wt., respectively. The optimum time of drug administration and drug dose-dependent effect on in vivo radiation protection of bone marrow chromosomes was studied in mice. Injection of 30-180 mg/kg SAZ 30 min before gamma irradiation (RT) with 4 Gy produced a significant dose-dependent reduction in the RT-induced percent aberrant metaphases and in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes at 24 h after exposure, with a corresponding decrease in the different types of aberrations. The optimum dose for protection without drug toxicity was 120 mg/kg b.wt. At this dose, SAZ produced >60% reduction in the RT-induced percent aberrant metaphases and micronucleated erythrocytes. SAZ also produced a significant increase in the ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes to normochromatic erythrocytes from that of irradiated control. Injection of 120 mg/kg of the drug 60 or 30 min before or within 15 min after 4 Gy whole-body RT resulted in a significant decrease in the percent of aberrant metaphases and in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes at 24 h post-irradiation; the maximum effect was seen when the drug was administered 30 min before irradiation. These results show that SAZ protect mice against RT-induced chromosomal damage and cell cycle progression delay.

Assumption-free Bayesian statistical methods were used. The analytical results demonstrate that the published incidence and mortality data do not show that radiation dose is associated with increased risk in this range of doses.

METHOD(S): Sixty-nine adult survivors of retinoblastoma (mean age, 33 years; mean years post-diagnosis, 31) who had enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study completed clinical cognitive evaluations and questionnaires assessing adult social attainment. Scores on all cognitive measures were converted to z-scores (M = 0, SD = 1) using age-adjusted normative data. Multivariable linear regression analyses, adjusted for age at diagnosis and disease laterality, were used to examine associations between disease and treatment exposures and cognitive outcomes. RESULT(S): Retinoblastoma survivors performed within normative expectations across most cognitive domains. In multivariable models, adjusted for disease laterality, survivors diagnosed at <1 year of age performed significantly better on measures of short-term verbal memory (beta=0.87, P<.01), long-term verbal memory (beta=0.66, P=.02), verbal learning (beta = 0.67, P=.02), and verbal reasoning abilities (beta = 0.79, P<.01) compared with survivors diagnosed at <=1 year of age. In multivariable models, restricted to bilateral survivors and adjusted for age at diagnosis, whole brain radiation exposure was significantly associated with poorer performance on tasks of short-term verbal memory (beta=-0.003, P = .03) and long-term verbal memory (beta = 20.003, P = .01). Reported social attainment was consistent with adult developmental expectations. CONCLUSION(S): Adult survivors of retinoblastoma demonstrate few cognitive or social attainment deficits decades following diagnosis and treatment. Findings suggest the potential for neural reorganization following early insult to the visual system as well as vulnerability of the developing brain to low dose radiation exposure. Early intervention and rehabilitation will be important for these patients.Copyright © 2014 American Cancer Society.",Excluded,0.9737562

Inflammation, cytokine production, and fibrosis were assessed in lungs of naive and sex-mismatched chimeric mice exposed to asbestos for 3, 9, or 40 days. Potential engraftment of donor-derived cells in recipient lungs was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Compared with asbestos-exposed naive (nonchimeric) mice, chimeric mice exposed to asbestos for 3, 9, or 40 days demonstrated significant abrogation of acute increases in asbestos-associated inflammatory mediators and fibrosis.

Cytogenetic tests were conducted on 2396 healthy Hungarian individuals and cancer incidence was followed up from 1989 to 2018. Venous blood samples were obtained from the subjects and metaphases from lymphocyte cultures were prepared. We compared the CA frequencies of the various smoking (1-5; 6-10; 11-19; or 20-40 cigarettes/day) and exposure (irradiation; chemical industry; chemical research laboratory) groups. Chromatid break (p = 0.0002), total aberration (p = 0.002), and aberrant cell (p = 0.001) frequencies were higher in smokers than in non-smokers. For very heavy smokers, total CAs were significantly higher than for non-smokers (<0.001) or less intensive smokers (p = 0.003-0.0006). Intensity of smoking was a predictor of chromosomal aberrations, while duration was not. During follow-up, 177 (7.3 %) cancer cases were found. A Cox-regression model showed that subjects with cell values >=2 CAs developed cancer more frequently (hazard ratio = 1.39; 95 % CI, 1.02-1.90). The relative risks of cancer were 1.06 (95 % CI 0.53-2.06) for light smokers and 1.74 (95 % CI 1.08-2.77) for very heavy smokers. The distributions of cancer sites showed differences between smoker and non-smoker groups: in male smokers, lung cancer, in non-smokers, prostate, and in females (both groups) breast cancer were most common.

The mean dose and the partial volumes receiving specified doses were determined for each gland from dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Nonstimulated and stimulated saliva flow rates were selectively measured from each parotid gland before RT and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the completion of RT. The data were fit using a generalized linear model and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model of Lyman-Kutcher. In the latter model, a ""severe complication"" was defined as salivary flow rate reduced to < or =25% pre-RT flow at 12 months., RESULTS: Saliva flow rates data were available for 152 parotid glands. Glands receiving a mean dose below or equal to a threshold (24 Gy for the unstimulated and 26 Gy for the stimulated saliva) showed substantial preservation of the flow rates following RT and continued to improve over time (to median 76% and 114% of pre-RT for the unstimulated and stimulated flow rates, respectively, at 12 months). In contrast, most glands receiving a mean dose higher than the threshold produced little saliva with no recovery over time. The output was not found to decrease as mean dose increased, as long as the threshold dose was not reached. Similarly, partial volume thresholds were found: 67%, 45%, and 24% gland volumes receiving more than 15 Gy, 30 Gy, and 45 Gy, respectively. The partial volume thresholds correlated highly with the mean dose and did not add significantly to a model predicting the saliva flow rate from the mean dose and the time since RT. The NTCP model parameters were found to be TD50 (the tolerance dose for 50% complications rate for whole organ irradiated uniformly) = 28.4 Gy, n (volume dependence parameter) = 1, and m (the slope of the dose/response relationship) = 0.18. Clinical factors including age, gender, pre-RT surgery, chemotherapy, and certain medical conditions were not found to be significantly associated with the salivary flow rates. Medications (diuretics, antidepressants, and narcotics) were found to adversely affect the unstimulated but not the stimulated flow rates., CONCLUSIONS: Dose/volume/function relationships in the parotid glands are characterized by dose and volume thresholds, steep dose/response relationships when the thresholds are reached, and a maximal volume dependence parameter in the NTCP model. A parotid gland mean dose of < or =26 Gy should be a planning goal if substantial sparing of the gland function is desired.",Excluded,0.9728516
614,"Use of unstable chromosome aberrations for biological dosimetry after the first postirradiation mitosis The loss of unstable chromosome aberrations after the first postirradiation mitosis makes their use difficult in radiation dosimetry. We describe here a method which, in a cell population observed at this stage, allows retrospective estimation of the frequencies of the unstable aberrations induced at the time of irradiation, and their use as a dosimeter. The laws controlling the behavior of unstable aberrations during mitosis were defined from a large-scale experiment on irradiated human lymphocytes. For cells undergoing the first, second, or third mitosis after irradiation, relationships were determined between the frequency, at irradiation time, of acentric fragments not arising from formation of dicentrics or rings, and the ratio of dicentrics and centric rings appearing without acentric fragments to the total number of dicentrics plus rings. On the basis of this ratio, the method described here provides an assessment of the postirradiation mitotic activity in a cell population. This assessment permitted estimation of the cell distribution and frequency of dicentrics plus centric rings, and of the frequency of acentric fragments at the time of irradiation. The use of this method for retrospective dosimetry after whole-body irradiation under various conditions of exposure is illustrated.",Excluded,0.9727896

This study examined the possible influence of constitutive eosinophilia on the clearance of Schistosoma mansoni infections in mice. Eosinophils from interleukin-5 transgenic mice exhibit normal ultrastructure and function with regard to phagocytosis and killing of bacteria and responses to chemotactic stimuli. IL-5 transgenics and non-transgenic littermates were immunized once or four (hyperimmunization) times with irradiated cercariae of S. mansoni. Animals were challenged percutaneously with unirradiated cercariae one month after their last exposure to irradiated parasites. One month after challenge transgenic animals, whether unimmunized, vaccinated or hypervaccinated, carried significantly more liver-stage parasites than non-transgenic animals. These results suggest that although eosinophils from IL-5 transgenic mice are functional for a number of key parameters, large numbers of eosinophils and/or high levels of IL-5 may in some way impair clearance of S. mansoni.

507,"[Possibilities of prognostication of individual radiation sensitivity] Proceeding from the concept of individual radiosensitivity as a sign of total reactivity 3 directions in a study of its possible prediction were considered: establishing correlation between separate indices characterizing the initial state and total radiosensitivity; correlation between body reactions to non-radiation exposures and subsequent irradiation; comparison of total radiosensitivity to irradiation at a small dose and subsequent irradiation at LD50. The following indices were used for the evaluation of the basal status of the body: oxygen consumption level, body mass increase rate, the level of water and basal metabolism, peripheral blood indices, body temperature, basal indices of the functional adrenocortical activity, the state of the cardiovascular system. The following non-radiation stress-exposures were used: physical exercise, constant magnetic field, starvation, hypoxia, and adrenaline administration. A V-type dependency was established for most investigated indices of the basal status and reaction of the body to non-radiation exposures. The utmost radioresistance was shown by animals in whom the basal indices or their reaction to non-radiation exposure approximated the average group level. The third direction: comparison of radiosensitivity and radiation damage--was analyzed by comparing the reaction of cerebral biocurrents to radiation exposure at a small dose with subsequent damage of the body following irradiation at a lethal dose. The accuracy of predicting the outcome of radiation injury by some of the indices varied from 65 to 80%. In some indices of the basal status and reactivity evaluation it reached 85-90%.",Excluded,0.9709065
187,"Relationships between nasopharyngeal carcinoma and radioactive elements in soils in China Earlier comparisons of epidemiological and geochemical maps of China disclosed associations between high mortality rates from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and low contents of magnesium in the soil. More recent work has shown that high rates of NPC are also associated with high levels of uranium and thorium in the soil. These latest findings are consistent with the earlier ones, since uranium and thorium occur predominantly in acid rocks poor in magnesium. Uranium and thorium are radioactive, and their progeny include radioactive elements such as radium and radon. Whether or not naturally occurring radioactive elements could be risk factors in NPC should, therefore, be further investigated. Direct carcinogenic properties of radon are well known, but in connection with NPC possibilities for reactivation of virus by natural ionizing radiation should also be considered.

452,"Loss of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 causes increased tumour latency in p53-deficient mice PARP-1-deficient mice display a severe defect in the base excision repair pathway leading to radiosensitivity and genomic instability. They are protected against necrosis induced by massive oxidative stress in various inflammatory processes. Mice lacking p53 are highly predisposed to malignancy resulting from defective cell cycle checkpoints, resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis as well as from upregulation of the iNOS gene resulting in chronic oxidative stress. Here, we report the generation of doubly null mutant mice. We found that tumour-free survival of parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice increased by 50% compared with that of parp- 1(+/+)p53(-/-) mice. Tumour formation in nude mice injected with oncogenic parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) fibroblasts was significantly delayed compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) cells. Upon gamma-irradiation, a partial restoration of S-phase radiosensitivity was found in parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) primary fibroblasts compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) cells. In addition, iNOS expression and nitrite release were dramatically reduced in the parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) mice. The abrogation of the oxydated status of p53(-/-) cells, due to the absence of parp-1, may be the cause of the delay in the onset of tumorigenesis in parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice.",Excluded,0.9677701
503,"Flexible Modeling of the Association between Cumulative Exposure to Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation from Cardiac Procedures and Risk of Cancer in Adults with Congenital Heart Disease Adults with congenital heart disease are increasingly being exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) from cardiac procedures. In a recent study, Cohen et al. (Circulation. 2018;137(13):1334-1345) reported an association between increased LDIR exposure and cancer incidence but did not explore temporal relationships. Yet, the impact of past exposures probably accumulates over years, and its strength may depend on the amount of time elapsed since exposure. Furthermore, LDIR procedures performed shortly before a cancer diagnosis may have been ordered because of early symptoms of cancer, raising concerns about reversal causality bias. To address these challenges, we combined flexible modeling of cumulative exposures with competing-risks methodology to estimate separate associations of time-varying LDIR exposure with cancer incidence and all-cause mortality. Among 24,833 patients from the Quebec Congenital Heart Disease Database, 602 had incident cancer and 500 died during a follow-up period of up to 15 years (1995-2010). Initial results suggested a strong association of cancer incidence with very recent LDIR exposures, likely reflecting reverse causality bias. When exposure was lagged by 2 years, an increased cumulative LDIR dose from the previous 2-6 years was associated with increased cancer incidence, with a stronger association for women. These results illustrate the importance of accurate modeling of temporal relationships between time-varying exposures and health outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

551,"Analysis of EPR and FISH studies of radiation doses in persons who lived in the upper reaches of the Techa River Waterborne radioactive releases into the Techa River from the Mayak Production Association in Russia during 1949-1956 resulted in significant doses to about 30,000 persons who lived in downstream settlements. The residents were exposed to internal and external radiation. Two methods for reconstruction of the external dose are considered in this paper, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements of teeth, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) measurements of chromosome translocations in circulating lymphocytes. The main issue in the application of the EPR and FISH methods for reconstruction of the external dose for the Techa Riverside residents was strontium radioisotopes incorporated in teeth and bones that act as a source of confounding local exposures. In order to estimate and subtract doses from incorporated (89,90)Sr, the EPR and FISH assays were supported by measurements of (90)Sr-body burdens and estimates of (90)Sr concentrations in dental tissues by the luminescence method. The resulting dose estimates derived from EPR to FISH measurements for residents of the upper Techa River were found to be consistent: The mean values vary from 510 to 550 mGy for the villages located close to the site of radioactive release to 130-160 mGy for the more distant villages. The upper bound of individual estimates for both methods is equal to 2.2-2.3 Gy. The EPR- and FISH-based dose estimates were compared with the doses calculated for the donors using the most recent Techa River Dosimetry System (TRDS). The TRDS external dose assessments are based on the data on contamination of the Techa River floodplain, simulation of air kerma above the contaminated soil, age-dependent lifestyles and individual residence histories. For correct comparison, TRDS-based doses were calculated from two sources: external exposure from the contaminated environment and internal exposure from (137)Cs incorporated in donors' soft tissues. It is shown here that the TRDS-based absorbed doses in tooth enamel and muscle are in agreement with EPR- and FISH-based estimates within uncertainty bounds. Basically, this agreement between the estimates has confirmed the validity of external doses calculated with the TRDS.",Excluded,0.9674494
362,"Radiation-induced oscillopsia in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients PURPOSE: To apply a battery of audiovestibular function tests and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the causes of oscillopsia in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients after irradiation (RT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Of 300 NPC patients, 12 (4%) developed oscillopsia after RT. The mean accumulated radiation dose to the nasopharynx was 112 +/- 30 Gy. Each patient underwent a battery of audiovestibular function tests, including audiometry and the dynamic illegible E, caloric, and rotational tests., RESULTS: Excluding 3 patients with neck fibrosis who could not perform the head turning movement, the remaining 9 patients displayed 100% abnormal dynamic illegible E test results and 100% abnormal refixation saccades. All 12 patients presented with bilateral hearing loss, caloric reductions, and reduced gains of the vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) on the rotational test, indicating bilateral VOR loss. After excluding tumor relapse and radiation necrosis of the brain by MRI, the oscillopsia in these 12 irradiated NPC patients was attributed to bilateral VOR loss., CONCLUSION: Radiation-induced oscillopsia in our NPC patients was attributed to bilateral VOR loss, possibly as a result of higher radiation doses. Hence, the therapeutic benefits of a second course of RT are associated with the potential risk of oscillopsia after RT.",Excluded,0.962483

The authors assessed agreement between medical x-ray histories obtained through interview and by review of medical records from thyroid cancer case-control studies conducted in Sweden (1985-1992; 123 cases and 123 controls) and from members of a prepaid health plan in the United States (1986-1991; 50 cases and 50 controls). In both studies, substantial disagreement was found between the numbers of x-ray examinations reported in the interview and in the medical records. There was an indication of relatively poorer reporting among controls, particularly for certain types of x-ray examinations and for large numbers of such examinations. Estimates of the risk associated with exposure to diagnostic x-rays were similar, regardless of whether interview or medical record data were used, even though ordinal dose classifications based on the two sources differed considerably. In populations with a high frequency of exposure, spurious associations with numbers of x-ray examinations or estimated thyroid dose might arise because of differences in recall.

500,"Patterns of diagnostic imaging and associated radiation exposure among long-term survivors of young adult cancer: a population-based cohort study BACKGROUND: Survivors of young adult malignancies are at risk of accumulated exposures to radiation from repetitive diagnostic imaging. We designed a population-based cohort study to describe patterns of diagnostic imaging and cumulative diagnostic radiation exposure among survivors of young adult cancer during a survivorship time period where surveillance imaging is not typically warranted., METHODS: Young adults aged 20-44 diagnosed with invasive malignancy in Ontario from 1992-1999 who lived at least 5 years from diagnosis were identified using the Ontario Cancer Registry and matched 5 to 1 to randomly selected cancer-free persons. We determined receipt of 5 modalities of diagnostic imaging and associated radiation dose received by survivors and controls from years 5-15 after diagnosis or matched referent date through administrative data. Matched pairs were censored six months prior to evidence of recurrence., RESULTS: 20,911 survivors and 104,524 controls had a median of 13.5 years observation. Survivors received all modalities of diagnostic imaging at significantly higher rates than controls. Survivors received CT at a 3.49-fold higher rate (95% Confidence Interval [CI]:3.37, 3.62) than controls in years 5 to 15 after diagnosis. Survivors received a mean radiation dose of 26 miliSieverts solely from diagnostic imaging in the same time period, a 4.57-fold higher dose than matched controls (95% CI: 4.39, 4.81)., CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survivors of young adult cancer have a markedly higher rate of diagnostic imaging over time than matched controls, imaging associated with substantial radiation exposure, during a time period when surveillance is not routinely recommended.",Excluded,0.9510816
469,"Collaboration of homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining factors for the survival and integrity of mice and cells Homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) are mechanistically distinct DNA repair pathways that contribute substantially to double-strand break (DSB) repair in mammalian cells. We have combined mutations in factors from both repair pathways, the HR protein Rad54 and the DNA-end-binding factor Ku80, which has a role in NHEJ. Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) mice were severely compromised in their survival, such that fewer double mutants were born than expected, and only a small proportion of those born reached adulthood. However, double-mutant mice died at lower frequency from tumors than Ku80 single mutant mice, likely as a result of rapid demise at a young age from other causes. When challenged with an exogenous DNA damaging agent, ionizing radiation, double-mutant mice were exquisitely sensitive to low doses. Tissues and cells from double-mutant mice also showed indications of spontaneous DNA damage. Testes from some Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) mice displayed enhanced apoptosis and reduced sperm production, and embryonic fibroblasts from Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) animals accumulated foci of gamma-H2AX, a marker for DSBs.

In this context, the aim of this research was to compare these methods in the biomonitoring of health professionals occupationally exposed to ionising radiation. In parallel, the C-banding technique was applied to confirm the presence of unstable chromosomal aberrations (dicentrics and rings). For this, samples of peripheral blood from health professionals of three hospitals (Recife - Brazil) were collected and lymphocyte cultures were carried out based on classical cytogenetic techniques. The number of cells scored per subject was the same (1000) for each assay. Among the individuals, those who do not usually wear a lead apron had higher frequencies of unstable chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei than the ones who carefully observe the radioprotection rules.

430,"Regional radiation dose susceptibility within the parotid gland: Effects on salivary loss and recovery Purpose: Xerostomia is one of the most likely late toxic effects of radiotherapy treatment in patients with head-and-neck cancers. Modern treatment techniques can incorporate knowledge of complication risk into treatment plans. To this end, the authors attempt to quantify the regional radiotherapy dose-dependence of salivary output loss and recovery in a prospective study. Method(s): Salivary output was collected from patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment for headand- neck cancers at the BC Cancer Agency between February 2008 and May 2013. Regional dose-dependence (i.e., dose susceptibility) of loss and recovery is quantified using nonparametric (Spearmans rank correlation coefficients, local linear regression) and parametric (least-sum of squares, least-median of squares) techniques. Result(s): Salivary flow recovery was seen in 79 of 102 patients considered (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon sign rank test). Output loss was strongly correlated with left- and right parotid combined dose phi = min (DL, 45 Gy)+min (DR, 45 Gy), and can be accurately predicted. Median early loss (three months) was 72% of baseline, while median overall loss (1 yr) was 56% of baseline. Fitting an exponential model to whole parotid yields dose sensitivities A3m = 0.0604 Gy?1 and A1y = 0.0379 Gy?1. Recovery was not significantly associated with dose. Hints of lateral organ subsegment doseresponse dimorphism were observed. Conclusion(s): Sub-segmentation appears to predict neither loss nor recovery with any greater precision than whole parotid mean dose, though it is not any worse. Sparing the parotid to a combined dose phi of <50 Gy is recommended for a patient to keep =40% of baseline function and thus avoid severe xerostomia at 12 months post-treatment. It seems unlikely that a populations mean recovery will exceed 20%30% of baseline output at 1 yr after radiotherapy treatment using current (whole-organ based) clinical guidelines.Copyright © 2015 Am.

Both sexes were considered to have anemia if their hemoglobin level was < or = 12 g/dL. No patient received corrective treatment for hemoglobin levels. Acute toxicity was analyzed weekly during radiotherapy and 45 days after therapy ended. The possible relationship between anemia and toxicity was analyzed, as was the correlation between hemoglobin values and the degree of toxicity., RESULTS: The findings were similar for all prognostic factors in patients with and without anemia. Hemoglobin concentration was < or = 12 g/dL in 24 patients (27.9%; mean, 10.93 +/- 0.78 g/dL). At the end of radiotherapy, hemoglobin levels were < or = 12 g/dL in 18 patients (20.9%; mean, 11.26 +/- 1.06 g/dL). The correlation between pretherapy and posttherapy hemoglobin concentration was significant at r = 0.729 (P = 0.01). The correlation between absolute hemoglobin values and the degree of toxicity, and the possible relationship between hemoglobin concentration and the appearance or the degree of toxicity after radiotherapy, was not significant., CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation of the tumor and healthy tissues was not linear.

627,"Retrospective assessment of self-reported exposure to medical ionizing radiation: results of a feasibility study conducted in Germany BACKGROUND: Exposure to medical ionizing radiation has been increasing over the past decades and constitutes the largest contributor to overall radiation exposure in the general population. While occupational exposures are generally monitored by national radiation protection agencies, individual data on medical radiation exposure for the general public are not regularly collected. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of assessing lifetime medical ionizing radiation exposure from diagnostic and therapeutic procedures retrospectively and prospectively within the framework of the German National Cohort study., METHODS: Retrospective assessment of individual medical radiation exposure was done using an interviewer-based questionnaire among 199 participants (87 men and 112 women) aged 20-69 randomly drawn from the general population at two recruitment locations in Germany. X-ray cards were distributed to 97 participants at one recruitment center to prospectively collect medical radiation exposure over a 6-month period. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to test differences in self-reported median examination frequencies for the variables age, sex, and recruitment center. To evaluate the self-reported information on radiological procedures, agreement was assessed using health insurance data as gold standard for the time period 2005 to 2010 from 8 participants., RESULTS: Participants reported a median of 7 lifetime X-ray examinations (interquartile range 4-13), and 42% (n = 83) reported having had a CT scan (2, IQR = 1-3). Women reported statistically significant more X-ray examinations than men. Individual frequencies above the 75th percentile (>=15 X-ray examinations) were predominantly observed among women and in individuals >50 years of age. The prospective exposure assessment yielded a 60% return-rate of X-ray cards (n = 58). 16 (28%) of the returned cards reported radiological examinations conducted during the 6-month period but generally lacked more detailed exposure information. X-ray examinations reported for the period for which health insurance data were available provided a moderately valid measure of individual medical radiation exposure., CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of more recent medical examinations seems in the German National Cohort study feasible, whereas lifetime medical radiation exposure appears difficult to assess via self-reports.

The Pasquill-Gifford atmospheric classes generally allow connecting atmospheric stability with dispersion of radioactive contaminants to the environment. In this work, an environmental release of radioactive Cs-137 was simulated and the resulting relative risk for solid cancer incidence among the affected population calculated. The HotSpot health physics code was used to simulate the radioactive atmospheric dispersion and calculate the Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE), which was then used to estimate the relative risk of cancer incidence. The main results from this work suggest that the relative cancer risk and atmospheric stability classes are linked by differences in the TEDE.

785,"GUCY2C signaling opposes the acute radiation-induced GI syndrome High doses of ionizing radiation induce acute damage to epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, mediating toxicities restricting the therapeutic efficacy of radiation in cancer and morbidity and mortality in nuclear disasters. No approved prophylaxis or therapy exists for these toxicities, in part reflecting an incomplete understanding of mechanisms contributing to the acute radiation-induced GI syndrome (RIGS). Guanylate cyclase C (GUCY2C) and its hormones guanylin and uroguanylin have recently emerged as one paracrine axis defending intestinal mucosal integrity against mutational, chemical, and inflammatory injury. Here, we reveal a role for the GUCY2C paracrine axis in compensatory mechanisms opposing RIGS. Eliminating GUCY2C signaling exacerbated RIGS, amplifying radiation-induced mortality, weight loss, mucosal bleeding, debilitation, and intestinal dysfunction. Durable expression of GUCY2C, guanylin, and uroguanylin mRNA and protein by intestinal epithelial cells was preserved following lethal irradiation inducing RIGS. Oral delivery of the heat-stable enterotoxin (ST), an exogenous GUCY2C ligand, opposed RIGS, a process requiring p53 activation mediated by dissociation from MDM2. In turn, p53 activation prevented cell death by selectively limiting mitotic catastrophe, but not apoptosis. These studies reveal a role for the GUCY2C paracrine hormone axis as a novel compensatory mechanism opposing RIGS, and they highlight the potential of oral GUCY2C agonists (Linzess; Trulance) to prevent and treat RIGS in cancer therapy and nuclear disasters.Copyright ©2017 AACR.",Excluded,0.9119127

Previous studies have indicated that the flow cytometric micronucleus (MN) assay in human transferrin receptor positive reticulocytes (Tf-Ret) in blood could be a sensitive biomarker for chromosome damage. In the present investigation, the utility and sensitivity of this method was studied in 44 young patients from Belarus, who were treated with 131I for thyroid cancer. Red marrow (RM) is the critical organ in radioiodine therapy (RIT). In our patients, it was exposed to 100-700 mSv low-dose rate irradiation within 2-4 days. About 3 days after 131I administration, the frequency of micronucleated-Tf-Ret (f(MN-Tf-Ret)) increases within 1 day to a maximum and declines in the following 2-5 days to its value before treatment. A total dose of 100 mSv was easily detectable. The sensitivity of the assay after acute irradiation may be 50 mSv. The method should be useful for monitoring individuals after a radiation accident, provided blood samples can be obtained within a few days after exposure. The time-course of f(MN-Tf-Ret) is interpreted using a model, which considers the exponential exposure of red marrow in RIT as well as the kinetics of erythroblast maturation and reticulocyte migration into the peripheral circulation. Similar modelling was done on published data of MN in immature mouse erythrocytes. Striking similarities in the kinetic and in the yield of MN-induction were found between these two species.

Here we describe that hairless XPA-deficient mice also develop skin tumors with a short latency time and a 100% prevalence after daily exposure to low doses of U.V.B. Surprisingly and in contrast to U.V.B.-exposed repair proficient hairless mice who mainly develop squamous cell carcinomas, the XPA-deficient mice developed papillomas with a high frequency (31%) at a U.V. dose of 32 J/m2 daily. At the highest daily dose of 80 J/m2 mainly squamous cell carcinomas (56%) and only 10% of papillomas were found in XPA-deficient hairless mice. p53 gene mutations were examined in exons 5, 7 and 8 and were detected in only 3 out of 37 of these skin tumors, whereas in tumors of control U.V.B.-irradiated wild type littermates this frequency was higher (45%) and more in line with our previous data. Strikingly, a high incidence of activating ras gene mutations were observed in U.V.B.-induced papillomas (in 11 out of 14 tumors analysed). In only two out of 14 squamous cell carcinomas we found similar ras gene mutations.

The resulting factor sum was then multiplied by a binary (1 or 0) intervention suitability factor which was 1 if both of the following were available: (1) a screening test with acceptable sensitivity and specificity for the health outcome of concern; and (2) an intervention that decreases morbidity or mortality. This resulted in an Intervention Needs Score that was used to set priorities for the medical examination program for the estimated 35,000 former LANL workers., RESULTS: Analysis of the algorithm output suggested that six exposure categories be recommended for consideration in a medical examination program. Beryllium, asbestos, and noise clearly warranted inclusion. Lead and ionizing radiation required careful consideration regarding availability of screening tests. Solvents were problematic due to the lack of screening tests and suitable intervention in formerly exposed workers., CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm approach to the needs assessment at LANL documented that six chemical and physical agents should be considered as candidates for inclusion in a medical examination program for former workers.

992,"Radiation exposure of extracranial organs at risk during stereotactic linac radiosurgery BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial tumors and vascular malformations can be performed by either a linear accelerator (Linac) or gamma knife. The aim of this first study on patients was to determine the radiation exposure of organs at risk and assess the risk for late effects including secondary tumors and/or hereditary disorders after stereotactic Linac radiosurgery., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) measurements were done on 21 consecutively admitted patients with various intracranial lesions scheduled for Linac radiosurgery. The TLD chips were placed on the eyelid, thyroid, breast and the regions of the ovary or testes., RESULTS: The mean doses in organs at risk were 276 +/- 200 mGy (eye lens), 155 +/- 83 mGy (thyroid), 47 +/- 22 mGy (breast), 20 +/- 12 mGy (ovary), and 9 +/- 3 mGy (testes). The doses decreased significantly with a larger distance from the isocenter., CONCLUSION: The absorbed doses to the extracranial organs at risk in patients undergoing Linac radiosurgery were very low, ranging from 0.025% (testes) to 0.76% (eye lens) of the mean maximum target dose (36 Gy). Nevertheless, while the majority of radiosurgery patients have benign tumors or arteriovenous malformations and their life expectancy is long, all doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable. This could be accomplished by the use of modern irradiation techniques including conformal beams with micro-multileaf collimator and avoiding beams directed to the trunk.",Excluded,0.87764543
247,"A prospective assessment of radiotherapy (RT)- Induced early functional renal changes by means of 23Na-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Purpose: Radiation-induced renal damage is an important side effect for patients with long-term survival after abdominal RT. Time course of post-RT functional and morphological renal changes is unknown. MRI with 23Na imaging is a novel technique which provides functional kidney assessment. In a previous analysis, for long-term survivors of gastric cancer, late radiation induced changes in the kidney regions exposed to high doses but no alterations in regions exposed to intermediate/low doses were observed. Morphological and functional assessment in the acute post-RT phase in comparison to baseline values are missing. The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate kidney alterations and to correlate them to focal renal radiation doses before and early after abdominal RT. Patients/Methods: 3 pats without any known pre-RT kidney disease who were to undergo RT for abdominal sarcoma and B-NHL, respectively, were examined on a 3.0T scanner before and 2-6 weeks post-RT. In addition to T1- and T2w morphological sequences, 23Na images were obtained using a dedicated 23Na-tuned coil. The planning CT and the associated local radiation isodoses were deformably matched to the morphological MRI sequences with the software ""Velocity"" (Varian). Kidney regions exposed to radiation doses 5Gy, 20 Gy and 40Gy were identified and mean 23Na signal gradient along the cortico-medullary gradient and gradient slope were measured in these regions separately. Result(s): Mean relative 23Na signal of the cortico-medullary gradient and gradient slope matched with values of healthy volunteers in the pre-RT examination. All results are summarised in Table 1. In the first post-RT MRI, morphological sequences (T1 and T2w) did not show any changes. In kidney regions with doses below 20Gy, no changes in the 23Na-gradient slope were observed. For regions with doses of 40Gy and beyond, a functional result was observed that was different from the low dose regions: The slope of the 23Na cortico-medullary gradient in the high-dose regions was markedly reduced in the post-RT MRI when compared to the pre-RT MRI. (Table Presented) Average slope (in arbitrary units/pixel along the cortico-medullary axis) pre and post RT for different dose regions. A marked decrease in average slope is found for the 40Gy regions, whereas the slope of the cortico-medullary 23Na gradient remains high in areas receiving 20Gy or less. Conclusion(s): 2-6 weeks post RT, marked functional effects were observed in high-dose areas while no alteration in kidney function was observed in low dose areas (20Gy), indicating the value of functional MR imaging in the early assessment and characterisation of the chronological course of radiogenic nephrotoxicity.",Excluded,0.8515029
279,"Investigation of different combinations of estrogen therapy and radiation therapy on prostatic adenocarcinoma (R-3327) The relative effectiveness of different combinations of estrogen therapy and radiation therapy against the R-3327 prostatic adenocarcinoma of the Copenhagen rat was studied. Because of similar actions of estrogens and radiation in the cell cycle, and possibly antagonistic effects reported in the clinical literature, we looked for an antagonism between these two therapeutic modalities. Radiation therapy consistently showed a greater tumor inhibitory effect than estrogen therapy alone at the dose tested. Combinations of radiation therapy with hormonal manipulation did not appear to show a greater inhibition of tumor growth than radiation therapy alone. There also did not appear to be an antagonistic effect between these two modalities in this system.",Excluded,0.83697087
200,"Evidence for variation in human radiosensitivity and its potential impact on radiological protection Radiological protection standards generally assume that all members of the population are equally sensitive to the adverse health effects associated with radiation exposure, recognising the age- and sex-related differences in sensitivity to radiation-induced cancer. It has become very clear over recent years that genetic and lifestyle factors can play important roles in the susceptibility of individuals to a range of diseases; as such, the same may apply to radiation-associated diseases. Evidence is accumulating from studies at many levels of biological organisation - cells, experimental organisms, and humans - that a range of radiosensitivity exists between individuals in the population. Consideration of improvements in radiological protection practices to take account of such differences will require the availability of robust and accurate ways to assess the sensitivity of an individual or population subgroup. In addition, there will need to be careful consideration of the ethical aspects relating to use of individual sensitivity information. These ethical considerations are very likely to be exposure context dependent, and require careful risk-benefit balance consideration before practical application.

377,"IL-6 promotes stemness of cancer stem cells and may contribute to radiation resistance of non-small cell lung cancer Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among both men and women. Long-term survival of lung cancer patients remains low despite aggressive therapies including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Ionizing radiation (IR) is the standard therapy for patients diagnosed with localized unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However local tumor control by standard fractionated radiotherapy (RT) remains poor due to tumor resistance to IR. Accumulating evidences have indicated that cancer stem cells (CSCs, also known as cancer initiating cells) exist as a very minor population in NSCLC tumors, which are composed of heterogeneous cell populations. Our laboratory and others found that CSC population increases upon irradiation, which may contribute to radiation resistance. The role of IL-6 in NSCLC progression has been suggested since high IL-6 levels were detected in sera of lung cancer patients, but not detectable in most patients with benign lung diseases. However, the exact mechanism by which IL-6 influences lung cancer progression and its role in CSCs mediated radioresistance remain unresolved. Method(s): We isolated CD133+ CSC population from 3 NSCLC cell lines (NSCLC-CSCs) and studied the role of IL-6 in CD133+ CSCs growth by treating cells with IL-6. In addition, we manipulated IL-6 expression levels in the IL-6 expressing A549 and H157 cells by the knockdown of IL-6 using lentiviral infection system carrying IL-6siRNA and isolated CD133+ cells for further analyses. The growth and stem cell marker expressions of these CSCs, IL-6 treated or non-treated, or IL-6 expressing or knocked down cells upon irradiation were then investigated. The differences in the activation of signaling pathways and neuroendocrine differentiation were also studied. Results and Conclusion(s): We found that IL-6 increased self-renewal of NSCLC-CSCs significantly and thereby increased NSCLC-CSC population. We also found that IL-6 increased stemness of the isolated CD133+ CSCs when CD133+ cells were treated with IL-6. More importantly, when we irradiated the CD133+ CSCs isolated from the IL-6 knocked down and scramble control A549 cells, we found that the CSCs isolated from the IL-6 knocked down cells exhibited lower survival than the CSCs of control cells. Therefore, we suggest that IL-6 may contribute to NSCLC-CSCs mediated-radioresistance via (i) direct triggering radioresistance, and (ii) increasing self-renewal and stemness of the survived CSCs. Mechanistic dissection studies revealed that the increased self-renewal of CSCs by IL-6 is due to the activation of the hedgehog signaling and the increased expression of bcl-2, while the IL-6 mediated increase of radioresistance is due to the activation of neuroendocrine differentiation, Stat 3 signaling pathway, and increased expression of bcl-2.",Excluded,0.7692125
629,"Lifelong hematopoiesis in both reconstituted and sublethally irradiated mice is provided by multiple sequentially recruited stem cells Objective. To evaluate the dynamics of stem cell production to hematopoiesis, the number of active stem cell clones and the lifespan of individual clones were studied. Materials and Methods. The clonal contribution of primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) responsible for long-term hematopoiesis was determined using two approaches. In one model, irradiated female mice were reconstituted with retrovirally marked male hematopoietic cells. In the second model, mice were irradiated sublethally without hematopoietic cell transplantation. In both models, bone marrow cells were serially sampled from the same mouse throughout a 12- to 20-month period and injected into irradiated recipients for analysis of day 10 colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S). The donor origin of CFU-S was determined by the presence of retrovirally marked cells or cells with chromosomal aberrations. Results. The results of the two essentially different models show that 1) hematopoiesis is mainly the product of small clones of hematopoietic cells; 2) the lifespan of the majority of clones is only 1 to 2 months; 3) the clones usually function locally; and 4) the vast majority of the clones replace one another sequentially. Primitive HSCs capable of producing long-lived clones (about 10% among all clones), which exist during the entire life of a mouse, were detected by the radiation-marker technique only. Conclusion. Multiple short-living clones (at least on the level of CFU-S production) comprise the vast majority of the active stem cells in transplanted recipients or after endogenous recovery from sublethal irradiation. © 2001 International Society for Experimental Hematology.",Excluded,0.7484024
76,"Residential radon and lung cancer: a cohort study in Galicia, Spain Case-control studies show an association between residential radon and lung cancer. The aim of this paper is to investigate this association through a cohort study. We designed an ambispective cohort study using the Galician radon map, Spain, with controls drawn from a previous case-control study. Subjects were recruited between 2002 and 2009. The data were cross-checked to ascertain lung cancer incidence and then analysed using a Cox regression model. A total of 2,127 subjects participated; 24 lung cancer cases were identified; 76.6% of subjects were drawn from the radon map. The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.2 (95%CI: 0.5-2.8) for the category of subjects exposed to 50Bq/m3 or more. This risk rose when subjects from the case-control study were analyzed separately. In conclusion, we did not observe any statistically significant association between residential radon exposure and lung cancer; however, it appears that with a sample of greater median age (such as participants from the case-control study), the risk of lung cancer would have been higher.",Excluded,0.69219005
147,"Racial disparities in receipt of standard chemoradiation in anal squamous cell carcinoma, an analysis of the National Cancer Database Background: Standard treatment for locally advanced anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) consists of concurrent chemoradiation. We evaluated whether racial differences exist in the receipt of standard treatment and its association with survival. Method(s): From the National Cancer Database, we identified patients diagnosed with anal SCC (Stages 2-3) between 2004 and 2015. Using logistic regression, we evaluated racial differences in the probability of receiving standard chemoradiation. We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate associations between race, receipt of standard therapy and survival. Result(s): Our analysis included 19,835 patients. Patients receiving standard chemoradiation had better survival than patients receiving nonstandard therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.68; p < 0.001). Compared to White patients, Black patients were less likely to receive standard therapy (odds ratio [OR] 0.85; 95% CI 0.76-0.96; p < 0.008). We observed no statistical difference in mortality between Black and White patients overall (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.15; p = 0.24). However, for the subgroup of patients receiving nonstandard therapy, Black patients had an increased mortality risk compared to White patients (HR 1.17, CI 1.01-1.35; p = 0.034). We observed no survival differences in the subgroup of patients receiving standard treatment (HR 1.00, CI 0.90-1.11, p = 0.99). Conclusion(s): Standard treatment in anal SCC is associated with better survival, but Black patients are less likely to receive standard treatment than White patients. Although Black patients had higher mortality than White patients in the subgroup of patients receiving nonstandard therapy, this difference was ameliorated in the subset receiving standard therapy.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

155,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor CIP2A indicates resistance to radiotherapy in rectal cancer Preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy, (C)RT, is an essential part of the treatment of rectal cancer patients, but tumor response to this therapy among patients is variable. Thus far, there are no clinical biomarkers that could be used to predict response to (C)RT or to stratify patients into different preoperative treatment groups according to their prognosis. Overexpression of cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) has been demonstrated in several cancers and is frequently associated with reduced survival. Recently, high CIP2A expression has also been indicated to contribute to radioresistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, but few studies have examined the connection between CIP2A and radiation response regarding other malignancies. We have evaluated CIP2A protein expression levels in relation to tumor regression after preoperative (C)RT and survival of rectal adenocarcinoma patients. The effects of CIP2A knockdown by siRNA on cell survival were further investigated in colorectal cancer cells exposed to radiation. Patients with low-CIP2A-expressing tumors had more frequently moderate or excellent response to long-course (C)RT than patients with high-CIP2A-expressing tumors. They also had higher 36-month disease-specific survival (DSS) rate in categorical analysis. In the multivariate analysis, low CIP2A expression level remained as an independent predictive factor for increased DSS. Suppression of CIP2A transcription by siRNA was found to sensitize colorectal cancer cells to irradiation and decrease their survival in vitro. In conclusion, these results suggest that by contributing to radiosensitivity of cancer cells, low CIP2A protein expression level associates with a favorable response to long-course (C)RT in rectal cancer patients.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

975,"FANCD2 depletion sensitizes cancer cells repopulation ability in vitro Inactivation of Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway in some cancers causes increased sensitivity to various drugs used for chemo-therapy. Several approaches have been suggested to artificially disrupt this pathway for better treatment. In our study, we have utilized RNA interference technique to knock-down the expression of FANCD2 and sensitize cancer cells undergoing treatment with DNA damaging agents. For this purpose, we transiently depleted FANCD2 by siRNA in a number of breast, bladder, or liver cancer cell lines and screened for mitomycin C or gamma-irradiation sensitivity changes. We could show that knocking-down FANCD2 gene expression increases sensitivity of cancer cells to mitomycin C and to less extent to gamma-rays. Importantly, this effect strongly correlates to repopulation ability of cancer cells and those cell lines with significant FANCD2 depletion revealed decreased recurrence capacity. In summary, the results we presented show proof of principle that opens new possibilities for further preclinical trials.",Excluded,0.543551

711,"Increased metabolic activity in the spinal cord of patients with long-standing Lhermitte's sign PURPOSE: To investigate the pathophysiology of the radiation-induced, chronic Lhermitte's sign (LS) on the basis of long-standing case histories with partial functional recovery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: As radiotherapy in two nasopharyngeal cancer patients, a biologically effective dose (BED) of 103.8 Gy(2) (case 1) and 94.8 Gy(2) (case 2) was delivered to the cervical spinal cord. Neurologic signs relating to the irradiated spinal cord segments developed after 2 months (case 1) and 5 years (case 2), with radiation-induced damage equivalent to grade 3 (case 1) and grade 2 (case 2) toxicity (Common Toxicity Criteria, Version 2.0). The clinical status improved to grade 2 (case 1) and grade 1 (case 2). Positron emission tomography (PET) and fibroblast clonogen assay were applied 25 and 7 years postirradiation, respectively, to characterize this rare clinical picture., RESULTS: PET demonstrated increased [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation and [(15)O]butanol perfusion, but negligible [(11)C]methionine uptake in the irradiated spinal cord segments in both patients. In clonogenic assays, fibroblasts from case 1 displayed much higher radiation sensitivity than in healthy controls, while in case 2 the fibroblasts sensitivity was normal., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggests a close direct relationship between regional perfusion and metabolism of the spinal cord, similarly as in the brain. The postirradiation recovery may be related to energy-demanding conduction, explaining the increased metabolism and perfusion. The increased radiosensitivity and higher spinal cord BED may have contributed to the more severe sequelae in case 1.",Excluded,0.5311681

All the gamma-irradiated allografts (tibialis anterior tendons) received an irradiation dose of 2.5 Mrad before distribution. Patients in this study had undergone a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan and physical examination. Patients were excluded from the study if they had a concomitant injury to other knee ligaments, previous surgery on the injured knee, or articular cartilage lesions greater than Outerbridge grade II.
