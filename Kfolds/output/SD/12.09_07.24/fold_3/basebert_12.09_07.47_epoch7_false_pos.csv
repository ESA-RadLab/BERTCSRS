247,"The radiologic technologists' health study in South Korea: study design and baseline results PURPOSE: To describe the study design, methods, and baseline results of a prospective cohort of radiologic technologists which we have initiated in South Korea., METHODS: The cohort participants were enrolled through a self-administered questionnaire survey administered from April 2012 to May 2013. Survey data were linked with radiation dosimetry, a cancer registry, and health insurance data by personal identification numbers. A nationwide representative survey was also conducted using a stratified random sampling design with face-to-face interviews., RESULTS: A total of 12,387 radiologic technologists were enrolled, which accounted for approximately 63% of all diagnostic radiologic technologists working in South Korea. For nationwide survey, 585 workers were interviewed using the detailed questionnaire, and buccal cells were also collected by scraping the inside of the cheek. The majority of study subjects were under 50-year-old and male workers. The average annual effective dose of radiation declined both men (from 2.75 to 1.43 mSv) and women (from 1.34 to 0.95 mSv) over the period of 1996-2011. A total of 99 cancers (66 cancers in men and 33 in women) were reported from 1992 to 2010. The standardized incidence ratio of all cancer combined was significantly lower in men (SIR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96) than general population, but the ratios for thyroid cancer were significantly higher than expected among both men and women., CONCLUSIONS: This cohort provides comprehensive information on work activities and health status of diagnostic radiologic technologists. In addition, the nationwide representative sample provides unique opportunities compared with previous radiologic technologist studies.",Excluded,0.95376223
474,"A sentinel case series of cancer patients with occupational exposures to electromagnetic non-ionizing radiation and other agents Background. There are reports that intense prolonged occupational exposure to non-ionizing radiation may increase risks for cancer. We previously have reported a sentinel cluster, of 7 workers with high exposures and short latent periods, and individual patients with brain cancer high occupational exposures and short latent periods. We present a sentinel case series (n=47, 40M, 7F) of cancer patients, referred to our medical unit with occupational exposures to non-ionizing radiation of all types. Objectives. Our aims were to report the findings on tumour types, age of first diagnosis, and latency, to describe their exposures and to examine the hypothesis that latencies for all tumour types (solid tissue, hematolymphatic, testicular) were coherently related to high occupational exposures starting at young ages. Methods. We divided the patients into groups by latency. We categorized each patient's exposures in regard to types of radiation, far or near field exposure and direct body contact. For some we had data on frequencies, for others we provided assessments. We also present the patient data categorized by age of diagnosis.We used a case-case type comparison to examine latencies for tumour types [solid, hematolymphatic (HL), testicular]. Results. 15 patients developed cancer with latent periods of less than 5 years and 12 patients with latent periods between 5 and 10 years. The remaining 20 patients had longer latent periods between first occupational exposure to EMF and diagnosis of cancer. 6 patients (12.7%) had multiple tumours. 12 patients (25.5%) reported cancer cases in co-workers. In the <5 years latency group there were 8 hematolymphatic cancers, 3 testicular cancers and 6 solid tumours [head & neck (including brain) and GI tract]. In all latency groups there were patients who were exposed to intense levels of electromagnetic fields (EMF), to several types of EMF, or to EMF in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) or other exposures, and patients who had direct body contact with the equipment, were in direct focus of high radiation, or worked in small, electronically dense environments. Case classification by age showed shorter latencies with younger ages, but this association is complicated by the fact that shorter latencies co-vary with younger ages especially for testicular tumours. But patients with testicular and hematolymphatic tumours had shorter latencies than those with solid tumours. Conclusion. Many of the patients were young and had extremely short latent periods, especially for HL and testicular cancers. The fact that latent periods for testes were very short, HL longer and solid still longer suggests a coherent and biologically plausible pattern of latency in relation to the onset of exposure to EMF and other agents. The findings strengthen the hypothesis that these exposures may possibly be the major cause of many of these tumours. The findings state the case for (1) better modelling of exposure sources and penetration into the body and (2) preventive and protective measures based on control of exposure at source, barriers, and personal protection.",Excluded,0.9537052
618,"Inter-laboratory comparison of cytogenetic endpoints for the biomonitoring of radiological workers Purpose: The evaluation of different cytogenetic endpoints of radiation damage for the biomonitoring of contract workers temporarily employed at nuclear power plants. Material(s) and Method(s): Blood samples from six donors were irradiated in vitro with doses ranging from 0.1 to 2 Gy 60Co gamma-rays. Compared were a conventional analysis for dicentrics, the conventional micronucleus (MN) assay, the centromere micronucleus assay using p82H and an alphaAllCen pancentromeric probe, and tricolour FISH with chromosome 2, 4 and 8 DNA probes for the scoring of translocations. Result(s): Agreement in the number of MN between Giemsa-and propidium iodine fluorescence-stained preparations was obtained. The control samples showed higher centromere positivity for the MN after FISH with the p82H probe compared with the alphaAllCen probe. The MN results with both probes showed a slight but systematic increase in the number of centromere-positive MN with dose, indicating that radiation, although principally clastogenic, also has aneuploidogenic properties. The values of the genomic translocation frequency (F(G)) derived from the observed translocation frequencies were systematically higher than the dicentric yields. Comparing the sensitivity of the different methods with restriction of the scoring time to 1 day for biomonitoring purposes, the centromere micronucleus assay had the lowest dose detection limit (0.1 to 0.2 Gy). Conclusion(s): This study shows that at present only the centromere micronucleus assay can combine high sensitivity with a reasonable scoring time for the biomonitoring of relatively large populations.",Excluded,0.9536706
476,"Reciprocal translocations as an indicator for radiation exposures in the low dose range A few years back, the frequency of dicentrics was determined shortly after exposure in five accidentally exposed radiation workers. In all cases the observed dicentric yield was significantly higher in comparison with the background level, and the resulting estimated whole body doses lay between 0.2 and 0.3 Gy. Now, a number of years later (1 to 11 years), the frequency of translocations has been determined by means of the FISH technique. Chromosomes 2, 4 and 8 were painted. The measured translocation frequency lay, however, within the range of the spontaneous variation between individuals. No radiation exposure could, therefore, be proven. In two further cases, the dicentrics were determined by means of the conventional Giemsa staining technique, and the translocations by means of chromosome painting carried out on the same blood samples, which were taken about 3 and 10 years, respectively, after the radiation exposure. The dose estimates obtained on the basis of dicentric frequency using the Qdr method, and on the basis of FISH detected translocations, are compared.

695,"Induction of micronuclei in human sperm-hamster egg hybrids at the two-cell stage after in vitro gamma-irradiation of human spermatozoa The efficiency of the micronucleus test to assess radiation-induced chromosomal damage in human spermatozoa has been investigated. Micronuclei were scored in human sperm-hamster egg hybrids at the two-cell stage, after exposure of human spermatozoa to in vitro gamma-rays at doses of 0.00, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, and 4.00 Gy. The relationship between the yield of micronuclei per two-cell stage as well as the percentage of two-cell stages with micronuclei and the different doses of irradiation were fitted to linear equations. To evaluate whether scoring micronuclei is useful for the quantification of chromosomal damage occurring in human spermatozoa, induced micronuclei at the different doses of sperm irradiation were compared to the induction of breaks and fragments in sperm-derived chromosomes. After interspecific fertilization of zona-free hamster oocytes by irradiated spermatozoa, a total of 699 fertilized eggs at the two-cell stage and a total of 387 sperm-derived complements were analyzed. The incidence of fertilized eggs with micronuclei at the two-cell stage coincided well with the incidence of sperm-derived chromosome breaks and fragments (e.g., 8.9% vs. 6.7% in the 0.25 Gy group and 52.8% vs. 58.6% in the 4.00 Gy group). A similar correlation was found between the number of micronuclei per two-cell stage and the number of breaks and fragments per sperm complement (0.09 vs. 0.07 in the 0.25 Gy group and 0.71 vs. 0.81 in the 4.00 Gy group). The results show that this test system can be used for the quantification of spontaneous or induced chromosomal damage in human spermatozoa.",Excluded,0.953629
601,"Radiation-induced micro-RNA expression changes in peripheral blood cells of radiotherapy patients Purpose: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding small RNAs that regulate gene expression, are involved in numerous physiologic processes in normal and malignant cells. Our in vivo study measured miRNA and gene expression changes in human blood cells in response to ionizing radiation, to develop miRNA signatures that can be used as biomarkers for radiation exposure. Methods and Materials: Blood from 8 radiotherapy patients in complete remission 1 or 2 was collected immediately before and 4 hours after total body irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays. Both miRNA and gene expression changes were measured by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction and microarray hybridization, respectively. Hierarchic clustering, multidimensional scaling, class prediction, and gene ontology analysis were performed to investigate the potential of miRNAs to serve as radiation biomarkers and to elucidate their likely physiologic roles in the radiation response. Result(s): The expression levels of 45 miRNAs were statistically significantly upregulated 4 hours after irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays, 27 of them in every patient. Nonirradiated and irradiated samples form separate clusters in hierarchic clustering and multidimensional scaling. Out of 223 differentially expressed genes, 37 were both downregulated and predicted targets of the upregulated miRNAs. Paired and unpaired miRNA-based classifiers that we developed can predict the class membership of a sample with unknown irradiation status, with accuracies of 100% when all 45 upregulated miRNAs are included. Both miRNA control of and gene involvement in biologic processes such as hemopoiesis and the immune response are increased after irradiation, whereas metabolic processes are underrepresented among all differentially expressed genes and the genes controlled by miRNAs. Conclusion(s): Exposure to ionizing radiation leads to the upregulation of the expression of a considerable proportion of the human miRNAome of peripheral blood cells. These miRNA expression signatures can be used as biomarkers of radiation exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.95362335
184,"Lack of high-dose radiation mediated prostate cancer promotion and low-dose radiation adaptive response in the TRAMP mouse model Cancer of the prostate is a highly prevalent disease with a heterogeneous aetiology and prognosis. Current understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the responses of prostate tissue to ionizing radiation exposure, including cancer induction, is surprisingly limited for both high- and low-dose exposures. As population exposure to radiation increases, largely through medical imaging, a better understanding of the response of the prostate to radiation exposure is required. Low-dose radiation-induced adaptive responses for increased cancer latency and decreased cancer frequency have been demonstrated in mouse models, largely for hematological cancers. This study examines the effects of high- and low-dose whole-body radiation exposure on prostate cancer development using an autochthonous mouse model of prostate cancer: TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP). TRAMP mice were exposed to single acute high (2 Gy), low (50 mGy) and repeated low (5 x 50 mGy) doses of X rays to evaluate both the potential prostate cancer promoting effects of high-dose radiation and low-dose adaptive response phenomena in this prostate cancer model. Prostate weights and histopathology were examined to evaluate gross changes in cancer development and, in mice exposed to a single 2 Gy dose, time to palpable tumor was examined. Proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis, DNA damage (gamma-H2AX) and transgene expression (large T-antigen) were examined within TRAMP prostate sections. Neither high- nor low-dose radiation-induced effects on prostate cancer progression were observed for any of the endpoints studied. Lack of observable effects of high- or low-dose radiation exposure suggests that modulation of tumorigenesis in the TRAMP model is largely resistant to such exposures. However, further study is required to better assess the effects of radiation exposure using alternative prostate cancer models that incorporate normal prostate and in those that are not driven by SV40 large T antigen. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.9536162
617,"Biological dosimetry using the micronucleus assay for lymphocytes: interindividual differences in dose response The dose response of the number of micronuclei in cytokinesis-blocked lymphocytes after in-vitro irradiation of whole blood with x rays in the dose range 0-4 Gy was studied for a heterogeneous population of 10 donors. One thousand binucleated cells were systematically scored for micronuclei. A linear-quadratic dose dependency of the micronucleus yields was observed. The data were used to derive the accuracy of the dose assessment with the technique in case of a radiation accident. It was shown that for doses of 2 Gy and higher, the uncertainty of the dose was predominantly due to interindividual differences in the x-ray-induced micronucleus yields. At the 95% confidence level, doses lower than 0.3 Gy could not be unequivocally detected with the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay due to the variability of the baseline micronucleus frequency within the donor population and the poor statistical accuracy when scoring 1,000 cells. The precision and sensitivity of the method in the low-dose range could be improved by the knowledge of individual pre-irradiation baseline values and an increase of the number of cells scored by automation of the technique.",Excluded,0.9536109
282,"Dose-response relationships for radiation-induced hyperparathyroidism It has been hard to establish with certainty that radiation exposure is a risk factor for developing hyperparathyroidism. In part this is because many cases of hyperparathyroidism remain asymptomatic and escape clinical detection. We present results from a study of 2555 subjects who received external beam radiotherapy to the head and neck area for benign conditions before their 16th birthday between 1939 and 1962. The average length of follow-up was 36.6 yr. There were 36 confirmed cases of hyperparathyroidism. Based on a relative risk model, the excess relative risk increased significantly by 0.11/centigray; however, the confidence interval was wide (95% confidence interval, 0.0-17.2). The hyperparathyroidism rates and dose-response relationships were not affected by gender or age at first radiation treatment. The demonstration of a dose-response relationship within an irradiated cohort supports an association between radiation exposure and hyperparathyroidism and suggests that the calcium levels of individuals irradiated to the head and neck area should be monitored.",Excluded,0.95360744
944,"Effects of 2.45-GHz microwave radiation and phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate on dimethylhydrazine-induced colon cancer in mice The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 2.45 GHz microwave (MW) radiation on dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon cancer in mice. The subjects were 115 Balb/c mice 4 weeks of age. The animals were divided into group A (control), group B (DMH), group C (DMH+MW), and group D [DMH + 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)]. Radiation (10 mW/cm2) was delivered dorsally with the E field parallel to the mouse's long body axis in an anechoic chamber. Radiations were administered 3 hr daily, 6 days per week, over a period of 5 months. The average SAR was estimated to be 10-12 W/kg. During the course of radiation treatments, DMH was injected once per week. The tumor promoter TPA was administered once per week for 10 weeks, from the third week on, after the initial treatment. The incidence of tumors did not significantly differ between the three test groups (groups B, C, and D; P > 0.25). However, the number of tumors, the size of the tumors, and the incidence of protuberant and infiltrative types in tumor-bearing animals were higher in group D compared to groups B and C (P < 0.05). No difference was found between groups B and C (P > 0.25). The study indicates that 2.45 GHz microwave radiation at 10 mW/cm2 power density did not promote DMH-induced colon cancers in young mice. The study also showed that TPA could accelerate colon tumor production if a tumor was initiated.",Excluded,0.9535863
248,"Long-term results of radiation therapy for pituitary adenoma Purpose. Local control for pituitary adenomas treated with external beam radiation therapy was retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of radiation. Materials and methods. Thirty-eight patients treated with radiation therapy between 1979 and 1994 were analyzed. The median age was 46. Nineteen newly diagnosed tumors were treated with surgery and radiation therapy, while the others were recurrent cases. Twenty-two tumors were non-functioning, while 10 produced growth hormone (GH) and three each were prolactin-, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing tumors. The median radiation dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Results. Non-functioning adenomas and prolactin-producing adenomas were completely controlled, judging from the absence of tumor progression on neuroimaging studies and clinical symptoms, and normalization of the serum prolactin level (< 25 ng/ml). On the other hand, local control was obtained in only one of the 3 patients with ACTH-producing adenomas, and the control rate at 10 years was only 46% for GH-producing adenomas. Panhypopituitarism developed in 35% of the patients after radiation therapy. No other serious complications were noted. Conclusion. Non-functioning pituitary adenomas and prolactin-producing adenomas were well controlled with external radiation therapy combined with surgery. However, dose escalation might be necessary to control GH- or ACTH-producing tumors. It is important to replace corticosteroid hormone and thyroid hormone in many patients.",Excluded,0.953579
317,"Dose-dependent expression of CLIP2 in post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid carcinomas A previous study on papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) in young patients who were exposed to 131iodine from the Chernobyl fallout revealed an exclusive gain of chromosomal band 7q11.23 in exposed cases compared to an age-matched control cohort. CLIP2, a gene located within band 7q11.23 was shown to be differentially expressed between exposed and non-exposed cases at messenger RNA and protein level. Therefore, a standardized procedure for CLIP2 typing of PTCs has been developed in a follow-up study. Here we used CLIP2 typing data on 117 post-Chernobyl PTCs from two cohorts of exposed patients with individual dose estimates and 24 non-exposed controls to investigate a possible quantitative dose-response relationship of the CLIP2 marker. The 'Genrisk-T' cohort consisted of 45 PTCs and the 'UkrAm' cohort of 72 PTCs. Both cohorts differed in mean dose (0.59 Gy Genrisk-T, 1.2 Gy UkrAm) and mean age at exposure (AaE) (2 years Genrisk-T, 8 years UkrAm), whilst the median latency (16 years Genrisk-T, 18 years UkrAm) was comparable. We analyzed the association between the binary CLIP2 typing and continuous thyroid dose with logistic regression. A clear positive dose-response relationship was found for young PTC cases [age at operation (AaO) < 20 years, AaE < 5 years]. In the elder age group a higher proportion of sporadic tumors is assumed due to a negligible dose response, suggesting different molecular mechanisms in sporadic and radiation-induced cases. This is further supported by the association of elder patients (AaO > 20 years) with positivity for BRAF V600E mutation.Copyright © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

504,"Mortality among individuals exposed to atomic bomb radiation in utero: 1950-2012 We examined the mortality risks among 2463 individuals who were exposed in utero to atomic bomb radiation in Hiroshima or Nagasaki in August 1945 and were followed from October 1950 through 2012. Individual estimates of mother's weighted absorbed uterine dose (DS02R1) were used. Poisson regression method was used to estimate the radiation-associated excess relative risk per Gy (ERR/Gy) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cause-specific mortality. Head size, birth weight, and parents' survival status were evaluated as potential mediators of radiation effect. There were 339 deaths (216 males and 123 females) including deaths from solid cancer (n = 137), lymphohematopoietic cancer (n = 8), noncancer disease (n = 134), external cause (n = 56), and unknown cause (n = 4). Among males, the unadjusted ERR/Gy (95% CI) was increased for noncancer disease mortality (1.22, 0.10-3.14), but not for solid cancer mortality (- 0.18, < - 0.77-0.95); the unadjusted ERR/Gy for external cause mortality was not statistically significant (0.28, < - 0.60-2.36). Among females, the unadjusted ERRs/Gy were increased for solid cancer (2.24, 0.44-5.58), noncancer (2.86, 0.56-7.64), and external cause mortality (2.57, 0.20-9.19). The ERRs/Gy adjusted for potential mediators did not change appreciably for solid cancer mortality, but decreased notably for noncancer mortality (0.39, < - 0.43-1.91 for males; 1.48, - 0.046-4.55 for females) and external cause mortality (0.10, < - 0.57-1.96 for males; 1.38, < - 0.46-5.95 for females). In conclusion, antenatal radiation exposure is a consistent risk factor for increased solid cancer mortality among females, but not among males. The effect of exposure to atomic bomb radiation on noncancer disease and external cause mortality among individuals exposed in utero was mediated through small head size, low birth weight, and parental loss.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.95356894

The quantitative transmission of Litomosoides carinii to un-irradiated and irradiated golden hamsters and white mice The quantitative transmission of Litomosoides carinii by Liponyssus bacoti to un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters and mice is described. Both young and adult, un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters were highly susceptible to L. carinii but mice (un-irradiated or irradiated) were poor hosts. All hamsters (18 un-irradiated and seven irradiated) became infected. Seven out of nine mice in an un-irradiated series became infected. There was apparently 'age resistance' or 'young susceptibility' in the hamsters. The susceptibility of young hamsters appeared similar to that of new-born Carworth white rats and cotton rats. The pattern of infection in un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters was similar. Results from irradiated animals were insufficient to draw any clear conclusions on the effect of irradiation to susceptibility to infection with L. carinii. X-irradiation apparently did not affect the innate susceptibility cr resistance of hamsters and mice to worms.

253,"Characteristics of induced mutations in offspring derived from irradiated mouse spermatogonia and mature oocytes The exposure of germ cells to radiation introduces mutations in the genomes of offspring, and a previous whole-genome sequencing study indicated that the irradiation of mouse sperm induces insertions/deletions (indels) and multisite mutations (clustered single nucleotide variants and indels). However, the current knowledge on the mutation spectra is limited, and the effects of radiation exposure on germ cells at stages other than the sperm stage remain unknown. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing experiments to investigate the exposure of spermatogonia and mature oocytes. We compared de novo mutations in a total of 24 F1 mice conceived before and after the irradiation of their parents. The results indicated that radiation exposure, 4 Gy of gamma rays, induced 9.6 indels and 2.5 multisite mutations in spermatogonia and 4.7 indels and 3.1 multisite mutations in mature oocytes in the autosomal regions of each F1 individual. Notably, we found two types of deletions, namely, small deletions (mainly 1~12 nucleotides) in non-repeat sequences, many of which showed microhomology at the breakpoint junction, and single-nucleotide deletions in mononucleotide repeat sequences. The results suggest that these deletions and multisite mutations could be a typical signature of mutations induced by parental irradiation in mammals.",Excluded,0.953548

Cytogenetic analysis (1000 metaphase plate per individual) and genotyping at 19 sites of genes involved in detoxification and DNA repair were performed in a sample of 83 Chernobyl liquidators and a matched control sample of 96 volunteers. In either sample, the frequency of chromosome aberrations was higher in carriers of the minor alleles of the XPD gene (sites 2251T > G and 862G > A) and the positive genotypes of the GSTM1-GSTT1 genes. The highest frequency of chromosome aberrations was observed in carriers of a combined genotype including at least one minor allele of the XPD sites + at least one insertion in the GSTM1-GSTT1 genes. The high-risk genotype, which had a prevalence of 64%, was strongly associated with a higher frequency of chromosome aberrations in both volunteers (OR = 6.9, P = 0.008) and Chernobyl liquidators (OR = 5.6, P = 0.002).",Excluded,0.9535467

The MBC showed a critical time when they were more radiosensitive. Although dose-dependent inhibition was found for both cellular proliferation and differentiation, the differentiation was more sensitive to radiation than proliferation when compared at ID50, the inhibitory dose that reduced assessment value by 50% of the control. Dose-dependent decrease of DNA and protein contents were also observed. The relative biological effectiveness values, ranging from 4.6 to 8.7, of beta ray from organically bound tritium compounds were obtained when compared with x irradiation at their ID50s on the inhibition of cell proliferation and differentiation, and on the decrease of DNA and protein contents of the cultures. The mixed exposure to x ray and one kind of organically bound tritium compound or to any two kinds of organically bound tritium compound resulted in a more efficiently inhibitory effect on differentiation than the exposure to x ray or to any one kind of organically bound tritium compound alone, especially when methyl-3H-thymidine was used.

This prospective study was designed to evaluate the treatment outcomes and treatment-related complications of patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with escalated radiation doses., METHODS: A total of 118 consecutive patients with T4 classification (1992 American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system), histology-proven nonmetastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma were treated with radiotherapy alone between 1992 and 1997 in a medical center in southern Taiwan. Thirty-two of them were enrolled into a prospective study of dose escalation and were irradiated to a total of 81 Gy. The other 86 patients received a total of 70.2 Gy. Potentially significant patient-related and treatment-related parameters were analyzed for their prognostic significance. Radiation-related complications were recorded and analyzed., RESULTS: The 5-year local progression-free rates were 61%, and 61% for patients receiving 70.2 Gy and 81 Gy, respectively (P > 0.05). The incidences of xerostomia, hearing impairment, and temporal radionecrosis were significantly higher for those receiving 81 Gy. The 5-year complication-free rates of patients receiving 70.2 Gy and 81 Gy were 14% versus 2% for xerostomia (P = 0.0070), 50% versus 30% for hearing impairment (P = 0.0198), and 91% versus 82% for temporal radionecrosis (P = 0.0400)., CONCLUSIONS: For patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with radiotherapy alone, dose escalation to 81 Gy failed to show benefits on local control rate.

825,"The development and biological characteristics of a novel potentially radioresistant inbred mouse strain The growth of biomedical research over the previous decades has been accompanied by an increase in the number, complexity and diversity of experimental animals developed as research tools, and inbred mice are some of the most widely used. However, thus far, no inbred mice have exhibited strong radioresistance for use in radiation-damage research. To develop a radioresistant mouse model, a female Japanese outbreeding strain ICR/JCL mouse was mated with a male Chinese inbred strain 615 mouse. From the F1 generation, the mouse line was maintained by brother-to-sister mating. A novel mouse strain was established over >20 continuous generations and designated the Institute of Radiation Medicine-2 (IRM-2) mouse. The biological characteristics, genetic characteristics and susceptibility to radiation of these mice were determined. The IRM-2 mice inherited traits from the parents, including strong reproductive capacity, stable physiological and biochemical indices and few differences among individuals. According to the genetic results, the IRM-2 mice exhibited homozygosity, isogenicity and consistency, in agreement with international standards for inbred strains. Radiosensitivity studies have previously suggested that the lethal dose (LD)50 values for IRM-2 mice were 7.17 Gy (male) and 7.5 Gy (female), resulting in a dose reduction factor value of 1.39 (male) and 1.37 (female). The mortality of IRM-2 mice irradiated with 8 Gy total body irradiation was 15% at day 9 and 90% at day 15 after radiation. The number of nucleated cells in bone marrow, DNA content and colony-forming unit-spleen counts in IRM-2 mice after exposure to gamma-ray irradiation were markedly higher than the corresponding values for the parental strains, suggesting that the IRM-2 mice exhibit high resistance to ionizing radiation. Thus, it is suggested that this novel inbred mouse strain may be developed as an animal model of radioresistance for future use in radiation research.",Excluded,0.9534904

The immunogenicity of irradiated blood parasites for intact cattle and splenectomised calves Intraerythrocytic forms of B. bovis were exposed to 350 Grays (Gy) gamma irradiation and were then injected intravenously into intact two and three year old Hereford steers. One of 15 steers died on initial infection and subsequently six steers were given a virulent heterologous challenge three weeks after recovery; all six animals were highly immune. The remaining eight animals were kept under quarantine conditions for 10 months and were then challenged with a different virulent heterologous strain of B. bovis. Seven of eight were highly immune, but one animal died. Subsequently a further 12 steers were injected intravenously with 1 X 10(8) irradiated organisms. All showed only mild transient clinical signs. After 12 months quarantine in a tick-free area these animals were then challenged with a virulent heterologous strain and all 12 were shown to be highly immune. Irradiation reduced the infective dose from 1 X 10(8) to 2.5 X 10(3) parasites. These parasites multiplied at the same rate, and achieved the same maximum parasitaemia as the parent non-irradiated strain, but the disease produced by them was not severe.

When all patients were considered there was no correlation between treatment dose and aberration frequency, but on subdivision into two groups on the basis of whether the reticuloendothelial system was involved in the cancer, linear regression analysis could be fitted to the data for each group. An in vitro dose response curve for dicentrics induced by 230 kV X rays at a dose rate of 23.3 rads per minute was constructed for use as a standard calibration curve for 48 hour cultures. The yield of dicentric aberrations was best fitted by a power law model, Y = kDn in which k = (1.59 +/- 0.66) 10(-4) and n= 1.49 +/- 0.08, (P =0.96).",Excluded,0.95345765
744,"Mayak worker dosimetry study: an overview The Mayak Production Association (MPA) was the first plutonium production plant in the former Soviet Union. Workers at the MPA were exposed to relatively large internal radiation intakes and external radiation exposures, particularly in the early years of plant operations. This paper describes the updated dosimetry database, ""Doses-2005."" Doses-2005 represents a significant improvement in the determination of absorbed organ dose from external radiation and plutonium intake for the original cohort of 18,831 Mayak workers. The methods of dose reconstruction of absorbed organ doses from external radiation uses: 1) archive records of measured dose and worker exposure history, 2) measured energy and directional response characteristics of historical Mayak film dosimeters, and 3) calculated dose conversion factors for Mayak Study-defined exposure scenarios using Monte Carlo techniques. The methods of dose reconstruction for plutonium intake uses two revised models developed from empirical data derived from bioassay and autopsy cases and/or updates from prevailing or emerging International Commission on Radiological Protection models. Other sources of potential significant exposure to workers such as medical diagnostic x-rays, ambient onsite external radiation, neutron radiation, intake of airborne effluent, and intake of nuclides other than plutonium were evaluated to determine their impact on the dose estimates.",Excluded,0.9534292
1040,"Radiation-dose response of glycophorin A somatic mutation in erythrocytes associated with gene polymorphisms of p53 binding protein 1 Information on individual variations in response to ionizing radiation is still quite limited. Previous studies of atomic-bomb survivors revealed that somatic mutations at the glycophorin A (GPA) gene locus in erythrocytes were significantly elevated with radiation exposure dose, and that the dose response was significantly higher in survivors with subsequent cancer development compared to those without cancer development. Noteworthy in these studies were great inter-individual differences in GPA mutant fraction even in persons with similar radiation doses. It is hypothesized that persistent GPA mutations in erythrocytes of atomic-bomb survivors are derived from those in long-lived hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations, and that individual genetic backgrounds, specifically related to DNA double-strand break repair, contribute to individual differences in HSC mutability following radiation exposure. Thus, we examined the relationship between radiation exposure, GPA mutant fraction in erythrocytes, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the key gene involved in DNA double-strand break repair, p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1). 53BP1 SNPs and inferred haplotypes demonstrated a significant interaction with radiation dose, suggesting that radiation-dose response of GPA somatic mutation is partly dependent on 53BP1 genotype. It is also possible that 53BP1 plays a significant role in DNA double-strand break repair in HSCs following radiation exposure. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.9534273
631,"[X-ray-induced breaks in the X chromosomes in Drosophila lines of various radiosensitivities] The frequency of X-ray induced X-chromosome breaks has been studied in females of the line rad (2) 201G1 hypersensitive to radiation and in females of the control line selected from the same population. The frequency of X-chromosome breaks was judged based on the frequency of X0 males occurrence. Synergism of the effects of X-rays (at doses 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 kr) and of hyperthermia (+37 degrees C, 5.5 hours) applied after irradiation served as an indirect evidence for the functioning of DNA repair systems. It is demonstrated that radiosensitivity of mature oocytes of the lines compared was equal and that hyperthermia applied after irradiation increased the latter effect in both lines. Young oocytes of the control line were radioresistant, and hyperthermia applied after irradiation enhanced its effect. Opposite to them, young oocytes of the rad line females were radiosensitive. They did not differ from mature oocytes in the frequency of X-chromosome losses. Synergism of the two factors (irradiation and hyperthermia) was not registered in young oocytes. On the basis of the results obtained, it may be concluded that radiosensitivity of young oocytes in the hypersensitive line is conditioned by the failure of DNA repair systems and that the rad (2) 201G1 gene may be considered, in relation to the genes controlling DNA repair, as a suppressor functioning selectively at a certain stage of oogenesis.",Excluded,0.95341265
16,"A novel method of continuous cage-side monitoring of hyperthyroid cats treated with radio-iodine A continuous monitoring system (MGP DM2000X) was assessed for monitoring gamma radiation emissions and determining appropriate isolation times for hyperthyroid cats treated with radioactive iodine (I(131)). Daily radiation emitted by 12 cats who had received a range of doses of I(131) (80-200 MBq) was measured and average background radiation readings deducted. The effective half-lives of the I(131) in the cats were found to have a median of 2.54 days (range 1.40-3.24 days). Cats treated with 200 MBq emitted 5 microGy/day more exposure than cats treated with lower doses throughout the study period (P=0.032). All cats were found to emit a total radiation dose exposure less than 100 microGy (range 0-43 microGy) during days 18-21 of isolation. The potential additional dose exposure to owners was calculated at various days that might be considered for the cats to be returned to their owners. Using this provisional data, maximum isolation periods at this institution could be safely reduced to 17 days as long as certain precautions are followed. This preliminary study demonstrated that this novel cage-side monitoring system can be used to calculate the effective half-life of I(131) and to measure gamma radiation exposure from treated cats, which may assist other institutions in determining appropriate isolation times for individual cats.Copyright British Veterinary Association.",Excluded,0.95340985
227,"Detrimental effects of electron beam irradiation on the cowpea bruchid Callosobruchus maculatus BACKGROUND: Electron beam (eBeam) irradiation technology is an environmentally friendly, chemical-free alternative for disinfesting insect pests of stored grains. The underlying hypothesis is that specific doses of eBeam will have defined detrimental effects on the different life stages. We evaluated the effects of eBeam exposure in a range of doses (0.03-0.12 kGy) on the development of the cowpea bruchid (Callosobruchus maculatus) at various stages of its life cycle., RESULTS: Differential radiosensitivity was detected during egg development. Early and intermediate stages of eggs never hatched after exposure to a dose of 0.03 kGy, whereas a substantial portion of black-headed (i.e. late) eggs survived irradiation even at 0.12 kGy. However, further development of the hatched larvae was inhibited. Although midgut protein digestion remained intact, irradiated larvae (0.06 kGy or higher) failed to develop into normal living adults; rather, they died as pupae or abnormally eclosed adults, suggesting a detrimental effect of eBeam on metamorphosis. Emerged irradiated pupae had shorter longevity and were unable to produce any eggs at 0.06 kGy or higher. At this dose range, eggs laid by irradiated adults were not viable. eBeam treatment shortened adult longevity in a dose-dependent manner. Reciprocal crosses indicated that females were more sensitive to eBeam exposure than their male counterparts. Dissection of the female reproductive system revealed that eBeam treatment prevented formation of oocytes., CONCLUSION: eBeam irradiation has very defined effects on cowpea bruchid development and reproduction. A dose of 0.06 kGy could successfully impede cowpea burchid population expansion. This information can be exploited for post-harvest insect control of stored grains.

885,"Pre-apoptotic response to therapeutic DNA damage involves protein modulation of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3 in acute myeloid leukemia cells BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are characterized by non-mutated TP53, high levels of Hdm2, and frequent mutation of the Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase. The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis., RESULTS: Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis., CONCLUSION: Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients.",Excluded,0.95338863
1132,"Impact of chemical exposure on cancer mortality in a French cohort of uranium processing workers Background: Nuclear workers may be exposed to a variety of chemical hazards, in addition to radiation. We examined the effect of chemical exposures on cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers at the AREVA NC Pierrelatte facility. Method(s): A cohort of 2,897 uranium processing workers employed for at least 6 months was followed from 1968 through 2006. Exposure to uranium and potentially carcinogenic chemicals was assessed with a plant-specific job-exposure matrix. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for cancers of the lung, lymphohematopoietic system, kidney and bladder, brain and central nervous system (BCNS), and prostate were estimated for each specific chemical exposure, with Cox regression models stratified for sex and calendar period and adjusted for socioeconomic status. Additional adjustments enabled us to examine the effect of co-exposure to uranium and other chemicals. Result(s): Exposure to aromatic solvents was associated with increased risk of BCNS malignancies after adjustment for other chemicals (HR=6.53, 95% CI=1.14-37.41; n=6) and for other chemicals and uranium (HR=7.26, 95% CI=0.90-58.19) in the annual exposure status model. Selected groups of lymphohematopoietic cancers were found associated with solvent exposure. Inconclusive results were found regarding chromium (VI) exposure, since only 2 workers died from lung cancer among 109 exposed. Conclusion(s): Based on our pilot study, it seemed important to take into account chemical exposures in the analyses of cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers. Am. J. Ind.

The sensitivity of the method was compared with chest radiography for detecting radiation-induced changes in the lung, regional alterations within (irradiated region) and outside (shielded region) the treatment ports, effect of irradiated lung volume, and dependence on time after radiotherapy., METHODS: Serial DTPA lung clearance studies were performed before the first radiation treatment (baseline), then weekly during a 5- to 7-wk course, and up to 12 times post-therapy over periods of 56-574 days. The total activity deposited in the lungs for each study was approximately 150 microCi (approximately 5.6 MBq). DTPA clearance, expressed in terms of the biological half-time, t 1/2, was computed from the slopes of the least-squares fit regression lines of the time-activity curves for the first 10 min for irradiated and shielded lung regions., RESULTS: Major findings include: (a) significant and early DTPA t 1/2 changes were observed in all patients during and after radiotherapy; (b) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in both irradiated and shielded lung regions in all patients suggesting a radiation-induced systemic reaction; (c) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were correlated (p < 0.05) with the irradiated lung volumes; (d) significantly reduced DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in three patients who subsequently presented with clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes consistent with radiation pneumonitis (t1/2 felt to 19% +/- 6% of baseline values, compared with 64% +/- 17% in the remaining patients [p < 0.01]); (e) the onset of decreased DTPA t 1/2 values in these three patients occurred 35-84 days before clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes; and (f) DTPA t 1/2 tended to approach baseline values with time after radiotherapy, suggesting a long-term recovery in lung injury., CONCLUSION: These observations show significant and early alterations in DTPA lung clearance during and after radiotherapy that may provide a sensitive assay to monitor changes in radiation-induced lung injury and may facilitate early therapeutic intervention.",Excluded,0.9533559
1077,"Lung cancer and cigarette smoking in Europe: An update of risk estimates and an assessment of inter-country heterogeneity Ten case-control studies have been carried out in 6 European countries to investigate the major risk factors for lung cancer. Carcinogenic effect from cigarette smoke was the most relevant interest in our study, which has included 7,609 cases of lung cancer and 10,431 controls, mainly population based. The results indicate elevated odds ratios (ORs; 23.9 among men and 8.7 among women) with attributable risks exceeding 90% for men and close to 60% for women. A large, and statistically significant, variability of the results across countries was detected after adjusting for the most common confounding variables, and after controlling, at least in part, for the instability of the ORs due to the small number of non-smokers in some of the study subsets. This pattern of lung cancer risk associated with cigarettes smoke, across different European regions, reflects inherent characteristics of the studies as well as differences in smoking habits, particularly calender periods of starting, and it is likely to have been influenced by effect modifiers like indoor radon exposure, occupation, air pollution and dietary habits. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded,0.9533318

It is known that ionizing radiation may have damaging effects on chromosomes. In the present study, we investigated the genotoxic effects of ionizing radiation on nuclear medicine workers. We used two different indicators of genotoxicity methods: sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronucleus (MN)., METHODS: The present research was carried out using 21 nuclear medicine workers (11 females and 10 males) during two periods: during normal working conditions and after a 1-month vacation. The radiation dose varied from 1.20 to 48.56 mSv, which accumulated during the occupational exposure time between two vacations. Peripheral blood samples were taken from each subject for two distinct lymphocyte cultures (SCE and MN) in each period., RESULTS: In nearly all subjects, SCE values increased significantly during radiation exposure compared to the postvacation period (P<.05). Similarly, MN frequencies in most of the subjects increased significantly during radiation exposure compared to the postvacation period (P<.05)., CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that both SCE and MN frequencies in most of the subjects were significantly higher during exposure to ionizing radiation than after a 1-month vacation period.

However, we currently do not have a universally applied endogenous control gene for normalization of data for gene expression studies, particularly those involving (60)Co gamma-ray-exposed human blood samples. In this study, a comparative assessment of the gene expression of six widely used housekeeping endogenous control genes, namely 18S, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, MT-ATP6 and CDKN1A, was undertaken for a range of (60)Co gamma-ray doses (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 Gy) at 8.4 Gy min(-1) at 0 and 24 h post-irradiation time intervals. Using the NormFinder algorithm, real-time PCR data obtained from six individuals (three males and three females) were analyzed with respect to the threshold cycle (Ct) value and abundance, DELTACt pair-wise comparison, intra- and inter-group variability assessments, etc. GAPDH, either alone or in combination with 18S, was found to be the most suitable endogenous control gene and should be used in gene expression studies, especially those involving qPCR of gamma-ray-exposed human blood samples.

The statistical analysis of the observational study of the population of Lermontov city (North Caucasus) was conducted. In the initial group, there were 121 people with lung cancer diagnosis and 196 people of the control group. Statistical analysis was performed only for men (95 cases and 76 controls). The use of logistic regression with correction on age gives the value of odds ratio 1.95 (0.87/4.37; 90% CI) per 100 working levels per month of combined (occupational and domestic) radon exposure. It was demonstrated that chronic lung diseases are an additional risk factor for uranium miners but it is not a significant risk factor for general population. Thus, the possibility of obtaining statistically reliable results in the observational studies when using the correct methods of analysis is demonstrated.Copyright © The Author 2014.

In the present study, the absorbed dose and the background radiation level are determined using the electron spin resonance (ESR) method on tooth samples. The effect of using different tooth surfaces and teeth exposed with single medical X-rays on the absorbed dose are also evaluated. A total of 48 molars of position 6-8 were collected from 13 district hospitals in Peninsular Malaysia. Thirty-six teeth had not been exposed to any excessive radiation, and 12 teeth had been directly exposed to a single X-ray dose during medical treatment prior to extraction. There was no significant effect of tooth surfaces and exposure with single X-rays on the measured absorbed dose of an individual. The mean measured absorbed dose of the population is 34 +/- 6.2 mGy, with an average tooth enamel age of 39 years. From the slope of a regression line, the estimated annual background dose for Peninsular Malaysia is 0.6 +/- 0.3 mGy y(-1).

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was then collected from 11 patients (10 lung cancer and one oesophageal cancer) after completion of radiation therapy. One month after irradiation, the HGF protein level in the lungs of irradiated rats decreased (p<0.05), followed by a remarkable elevation in HGF protein levels 2 (p<0.05) and 3 months (nonsignificant) after irradiation accompanied by the clinical appearance of radiation pneumonitis. Finally, HGF protein levels in the lung returned to their original level 6 months after thoracic irradiation.

Sensitisation to DNCB occurred in 52% of 37 patients but in 78% of controls. There was depression of lymphocyte transformation by PPD in 19 patients compared with controls (P=0.001), but there was no difference in lymphocyte transformation by PHA or pokeweed mitogen between 34 patients and controls. In a pilot study patients were randomly allocated to autograft (eight) or non-autograft (seven) groups. The autograft group were given an intradermal injection of a suspension of irradiated autologous tumour-cells mixed with intradermal BCG on the day of operation. Tests of cell-mediated immunity were repeated two weeks after operation. Five patients in each group received a course of radiotherapy to the mediastinum three weeks after operation. There was a rise in cutaneous tuberculin reactivity (P=0.08) and total leucocyte count (P=0.09) in the autograft group postoperatively with a fall in total lymphocyte and T lymphocyte counts in the non-autograft group (P less 0.05). These differences, however, were not followed by any difference in the frequency of tumour recurrence or the survival rate two years after operation.

Success in relating mutant frequencies to exposure to high levels of mutagens has encouraged researchers to examine the effects of lower doses, such as those found among workers exposed at their jobs. In order to relate low doses of mutagens to biological effects, accurate characterization of exposure is critical, but most occupational studies are forced to use gross measures of exposure derived from job title or professional judgments as to potential exposure. Mutant frequencies and other relevant lymphocyte characteristics of 58 industrial workers were related to exposure status in two ways. When workers were classed as ""exposed"" or ""unexposed"" to ionizing radiation, no difference in any biological variable was seen between the two groups. When dosimeter readings were used as the exposure indicator, significant relationships appeared between dose and mutant frequency and CD4/CD8 lymphocyte subpopulation ratios. Mutant frequency was also positively related to age and smoking status.

We hypothesized that LC3B could play a role in the regulation of thyroid cancer cells response to radiation. Expression of LC3B was examined by real-time PCR and Western blot in FTC133, FTC236 and FTC238 cells. Stable LC3B-deficient cells were created by transfection with lentiviral particles containing LC3B specific shRNA. Thyroid cancer cell viability, proliferation, migration and apoptosis were analyzed in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells after exposure to gamma-radiation (6 Gy). Immunostaining with anti-LC3B was performed on tissue samples from 10 patients with anaplastic (ATCs) and 10 patients with papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs). LC3B expression was decreased in cell lines that derived from metastatic lesions (by 70% in FTC236 and by 90% in FTC238) as compared to FTC133 cells. Transfection with lentiviral particles inhibited LC3B mRNA level by 80% in FTC133 cells. LC3B silencing had no effect on cell cycle, did not inhibit thyroid cancer cells migration, and did not induce apoptosis. Glucose deprivation led to phosphorylation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells. Induction of LC3BII and loss of p62 protein were detected in LC3B-expressing but not in LC3B-deficient cells. gamma-radiation induced gH2AX and caspase 3 cleavage in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells. However, recovery of thyroid cancer cells after irradiation was more efficient in LC3B-deficient cells. Colony forming assay showed that survival fraction after gamma-radiation was higher in LC3B-deficient cells compared to LC3B-expressing cells (p = 0.01). Granular cytoplasmic staining with anti-LC3B was detected in 5/10 (50%) differentiated PTCs, but in 0/10 (0%) ATCs.

It has been observed that operators exposed to same RF fields with occupational exposure limits. Many workers have health complaints, such as elevated body temperatures in the factory. Safe distances or areas for workers should be recommended in these systems. Protective measures could be implemented to minimize these exposures. Further measurements and occupational exposure studies of RF exposed women and men are needed to demonstrate the levels of exposed Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR).

Adjusted risk estimates were obtained from regression analyses based on expected values for true time-weighted average residential radon concentration (TWA), conditional on observed TWA. Without adjustment for random error in the TWA estimates, the linear excess relative risk coefficient was 0.10 per 100 Bq m(-3), but an excess relative risk of about 0.15 to 0.20 per 100 Bq m(-3) was suggested following adjustment. The potentially significant consequences of errors in the retrospective radon exposure assessment should be taken into consideration in the risk estimation as well as in comparisons of results of different studies and in future pooled analyses.",Excluded,0.95299417
964,"PHD3-dependent hydroxylation of HCLK2 promotes the DNA damage response The DNA damage response (DDR) is a complex regulatory network that is critical for maintaining genome integrity. Posttranslational modifications are widely used to ensure strict spatiotemporal control of signal flow, but how the DDR responds to environmental cues, such as changes in ambient oxygen tension, remains poorly understood. We found that an essential component of the ATR/CHK1 signaling pathway, the human homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans biological clock protein CLK-2 (HCLK2), associated with and was hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 3 (PHD3). HCLK2 hydroxylation was necessary for its interaction with ATR and the subsequent activation of ATR/CHK1/p53. Inhibiting PHD3, either with the pan-hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) or through hypoxia, prevented activation of the ATR/CHK1/p53 pathway and decreased apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Consistent with these observations, we found that mice lacking PHD3 were resistant to the effects of ionizing radiation and had decreased thymic apoptosis, a biomarker of genomic integrity. Our identification of HCLK2 as a substrate of PHD3 reveals the mechanism through which hypoxia inhibits the DDR, suggesting hydroxylation of HCLK2 is a potential therapeutic target for regulating the ATR/CHK1/p53 pathway.",Excluded,0.9529803
445,"Residential randon exposure and lung cancer risk in Misasa, Japan: a case-control study In order to investigate an association between residential radon exposure and risk of lung cancer, a case-control study was conducted in Misasa Town, Tottori Prefecture, Japan. The case series consisted of 28 people who had died of lung cancer in the years 1976-96 and 36 controls chosen randomly from the residents in 1976, matched by sex and year of birth. Individual residential radon concentrations were measured for 1 year with alpha track detectors. The average radon concentration was 46 Bq/m3 for cases and 51 Bq/m3 for controls. Compared to the level of 24 or less Bq/m3, the adjusted odds ratios of lung cancer associated with radon levels of 25-49, 50-99 and 100 or more Bq/m3, were 1.13 (95% confidence interval; 0.29-4.40), 1.23 (0.16-9.39) and 0.25 (0.03-2.33), respectively. None of the estimates showed statistical significance, due to small sample size. When the subjects were limited to only include residents of more than 30 years, the estimates did not change substantially. This study did not find that the risk pattern of lung cancer, possibly associated with residential radon exposure, in Misasa Town differed from patterns observed in other countries.",Excluded,0.9529582
428,"Phosphorylation of Ser312 contributes to tumor suppression by p53 in vivo The tumor suppressor p53 is a master sensor of stress, and posttranslational modifications are key in controlling its stability and transcriptional activities. p53 can be phosphorylated on at least 23 Ser/Thr residues, the majority of which are phosphorylated by stress-related kinases. An exception is Ser315 in human p53 (Ser312 in mouse), which is predominantly phosphorylated by cell cyclerelated kinases. To understand the biological importance of Ser312 phosphorylation in vivo, wegenerated p53Ser312Ala knock-in mice. We show here that, although Ser312 is not essential for mouse life span under normal physiological conditions, Ser312Ala mutation dampens p53's activity during embryonic development. This is evident from its partial rescue of embryonic lethality caused by Mdm4 deletion. In agreement with the notion that Ser312 mutation weakens p53 function, Ser312Ala mice are alsomore susceptible to tumorigenesis following a sublethal ionizing radiation dose. Importantly, in the cohort studied, Ser312 mutation predisposes mice to develop thymic lymphomas and liver tumors, partly due to p53Ser312Ala's inability to fully induce a set of p53 target genes including p21 and cyclin G1. Thus, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser312 is required for p53 to function fully as a tumor suppressor in vivo.",Excluded,0.95294833

651,"Chromosomal principle of radiation-induced F1 sterility in Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) A dose-response analysis of chromosomal aberrations was performed in male progeny of gamma-irradiated males in the flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella. For comparison, several female progeny from each dose level were examined. Aberrations were detected on microspread preparations of pachytene nuclei in the electron microscope and classified according to pairing configurations of synaptonemal complexes (SCs). Fragmentation and various translocations were the most numerous aberrations, whereas interstitial deletion and inversion were rare. At 100 Gy, relatively simple multiple translocations were found. Multiple translocations showing complicated configurations occurred at 150 and 200 Gy, and their number increased with the dose. In males, the mean number of chromosomal breaks resulting in aberrations linearly increased with the dose from 8.4 to 16.2 per nucleus. In females, this value achieved a maximum of 11.2 breaks/nucleus at 200 Gy. Three factors were suggested to contribute to the reported higher level of F1 sterility in males than females: (i) survival of males with high numbers of breaks, (ii) crossing-over in spermatogenesis but not in the achiasmatic oogenesis, and (iii) a higher impact of induced changes on the fertility of males than females. It was concluded that translocations are most responsible for the production of unbalanced gametes resulting in sterility of F1 moths. However, F1 sterility predicted according to the observed frequency of aberrations was much higher than the actual sterility reported earlier. This suggests a regulation factor which corrects the predicted unbalanced state towards balanced segregation of translocated chromosomes.",Excluded,0.952839
823,"Monitoring of Tritium Internal Exposure Doses of Heavy-Water Reactor Workers in Third Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant To analyze the tritium internal exposure dose of workers in the Third Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant over the past 15 years. Urine samples provided by workers are tested directly to analyze the tritium concentrations and estimate internal exposure dose. Since 2004, an average of approximately 1600 workers have been monitored annually, with an average annual monitoring frequency of approximately 11 000. Since 2004, the average annual collective dose of tritium internal exposure was 149.62 person.mSv, accounting for 19.07% of the total annual collective dose. A total of 18 workers' annual individual internal tritium radiation doses exceeded 2 mSv, of which 5 workers' internal tritium radiation doses in a single intake exceeded 2 mSv. The occupational population with the largest total internal tritium radiation doses consists of maintenance personnel, fuel operators, and radiation protection personnel, whose collective doses of internal exposure account for 75.51% of the total collective doses within the plant. Over 15 years of operation, the internal tritium radiation doses of workers in the Third Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant have been strictly controlled within the national regulatory limit and power plant management target, ensuring the health and safety of the workers.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Excluded,0.95277184

Background and purpose To evaluate the outcome of malignant salivary gland tumours treated with neutron therapy to assess the potential for other high linear energy transfer (LET) beams. Materials and methods Neutrons at iThemba LABS are produced by the reaction of 66 MeV protons on a beryllium target. A median dose 20.4 Gy, in 12 fractions in 4 weeks or 15 fractions in 5 weeks, was given to 335 patients with 176 irresectable, 104 macroscopically residual and 55 unresected tumours. Results Locoregional control was 60.6% at 5 years and 39.1% at 10 years and DSS was 66.8% and 53.7% at 5 and 10 years respectively. In the univariate analysis T4, >4 cm, high grade, squamous carcinoma, unresected and irresectable tumours, and positive nodes were significantly worse for LRC. In the multivariate analysis tumours >6 cm, squamous carcinoma, irresectable tumours and nodes were significantly worse for LRC. Tumours >6 cm, high grade, squamous carcinoma and nodes were significantly worse for DSS. Neither LRC nor DSS was influenced by age, sex, site, dose, fractionation or for initial or recurrent disease. Conclusions Neutron therapy appears to be the treatment of choice for macroscopically incompletely excised and irresectable salivary gland tumours with improved survival rates. Further improvement may be achieved with other high LET modalities with a superior dose profile, such as carbon ions. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.9527595

Introduction of indomethofene at doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg during time from 30 min to 3 days after irradiation resulted in reliable increase of mice survivability, 40-60% on average. Mice survival rate after single peroral introduction of indomethofene radioprotective doses was comparable with that resulting from referencing preparation estrofeme, which is estradiol oral dosage from (under the assumption that in contrast to indometafene estrofeme was introduced repeatedly every other day from 3 till 21 day after irradiation). Therapeutic action of indomethofene was confirmed in the experiments on dogs. After radiation exposure at a dose which caused the death of all dogs of control group, survival rate of experimental animals which received single oral dosage form of indomethofene at radioprotective dose in 1 and 3 days after irradiation was 40%.

28,"Cytogenetic assessment of heterogeneous radiation doses in cancer patients treated with fractionated radiotherapy The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vivo dose-response relation of chromosome aberration formation and distribution in a context of localised and fractionated radiotherapy. Cytogenetic analysis was applied to eight patients, all treated for the same tumour localisation; the same localisation was used to prevent the variability usually observed between patients treated with radiotherapy and to allow the corresponding roles of the size of irradiation field and of the dose rate to be studied. The yield of dicentrics, centric rings and fragments was measured in blood samples taken before treatment, during the course of radiotherapy and up to 6 months after. After the first fraction of radiotherapy, we observed that the whole-body dose estimated from the yield of dicentrics and rings was higher (0.35+/-0.2 Gy) than the calculated equivalent whole-body dose (0.07+/-0.04 Gy). By contrast, the partial-body dose derived from the Qdr (quotient of dicentrics and rings) model was estimated to be 2.2+/-0.3 Gy, which agreed quite well with the dose delivered to the tumour (2.1+/-0.1 Gy). We also found a correlation between the yield of induced chromosome aberrations and the target field size (p = 0.014). U-value analysis showed that the distribution of dicentrics and rings was overdispersed, despite the fractionation of the exposure, and a positive correlation between the U-value and the dose rate was observed (p = 0.017). Overall, these results suggest that the proportion of undamaged lymphocytes could increase with the dose rate.",Excluded,0.9526482

The AIM of this study was to investigate the biological radiation effect on the basis of a characteristic radiation parameter., PATIENTS, METHODS: After RSO procedures with yttrium-90 citrate colloid and subsequent immobilisation of the knee, blood specimens of 10 patients were collected immediately before RSO and 11 to 13 days after the intervention. The yield of dicentric chromosomes in the lymphocytes was determined exclusively in metaphases of the first cell cycle in vitro. In addition, activity leakage was measured by wholebody bremsstrahlung-scintigraphy., RESULTS: No statistically significant increase in the number of dicentric chromosomes (26 before treatment and 34 after treatment) in 20 192 cells analyzed from the 20 blood samples could be found as a result of RSO. However, the analysis of at least 1000 cells per blood sample demonstrates a tendency for a biological radiation effect in the blood of patients on the basis of this characteristic radiation parameter. Two of the 10 RSO patients had undergone a second RSO using yttrium-90 citrate, whereby one patient displayed activity transport out of the knee joint, amounting to 6 MBq. Only for him a radiation effect (about 130 mGy per single RSO) could be calculated by biological dosimetry., CONCLUSION: Since in general, based on the analysis of dicentric chromosomes in at least 1000 lymphocytes per individual, detection limits for groups of persons after long-term exposures to low-LET radiation of 50-100 mGy are possible, we assume that RSO with yttrium-90 should be associated with a low whole-body radiation exposure.",Excluded,0.9526384

Two subpopulations were analyzed: all measured cases who survived at least 5 yr after the start of employment and all cases who survived at least 2 yr after first measurement. The first constituted a group based on year of entry; it contained 1468 women who experienced 42 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.4. The second comprised a group based on first measurement; it contained 1257 women who experienced 13 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.2. The dose-response function, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD, and simplifications of this general form, were fit to each data set. Incidence (I) was in units of bone sarcomas per person-yr; (D) was the quantity (muCi) of radium that entered the blood. Two functions, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD and I = (C + beta D2)e-gammaD, fit the data for year of entry (p greater than or equal to 0.05); both these functions and I = (C + alpha D) fit the data for first measurement.

Materials/Methods: Records from patients treated with hemostatic radiation therapy between May 2012 and May 2014 in a single institution were reviewed. The endpoints analyzed were: initial bleeding control rate, re-bleeding incidence and final bleeding control (after salvage treatment of initial treatment failures or re-bleeding). Biological equivalent dose (BED) was categorized (<30 Gy10 vs >/Z 30 Gy10). The statistics were done using Kaplan-Meier representation of re-bleeding events in time and Fisher Exact test as hypothesis test for categorical variables using SPSS V2.0 software. The study was previously approved by IRB. Result(s): In total, eighty patients were treated during the period studied. Information concerning symptom response was available for 72 of 80 patients. The overall initial bleeding control rate was 81.9% (59/72). It was 85.7% (12/14), 100% (4/4), 76.5% (13/17), 78.3% (18/23), 77.8% (7/9), and 100% (5/5) in H&N, GYN, Urinary, GI, Airway, and extremities, respectively. Re-bleeding incidence was 25.4% (15/59) of the patients with initial bleeding control, and when it occurred the median time was 8 weeks after the irradiation (range: 1 e 96 weeks). With salvage treatment, the final bleeding control was 64.3%, 100%, 76.5%, 78.3%, 75%, and 100% in H&N, GYN, Urinary, GI, Airway, and extremities, respectively. BED less than 30 Gy10 was not associated with a significant lower control (75.6% vs 92.3%, P = 0.113).

288,"The prostate cancer risk locus at 10q11 is associated with DNA repair capacity Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mildly predict prostate cancer risk. These SNPs are local tagging markers for causal gene alterations. Consideration of candidate genes in the tagged regions would be facilitated by additional information on the particular pathomechanisms which contribute to the observed risk increase. In this study we test for an association of prostate cancer tagging SNPs with alterations in DNA repair capacity, a phenotype that is frequently involved in cancer predisposition. DNA repair capacity was assessed on blood lymphocytes from 128 healthy probands after ionizing irradiation. We used the micronucleus (MN) assay to determine the cellular DNA double-strand break repair capacity and flow cytometry to measure damage induced mitotic delay (MD). Probands were genotyped for a panel of 14 SNPs, each representing an independent prostate cancer risk locus previously identified by GWAS. Associations between germline variants and DNA repair capacity were found for the SNPs rs1512268 (8p21), rs6983267 (8q24) and rs10993994 (10q11). The most significant finding was an association of homozygous rs10993994 T-allele carriers with a lower MN frequency (. p=. 0.0003) and also a decreased MD index (. p=. 0.0353). Cells with prostate cancer risk alleles at rs10993994 seem to cope more efficiently with DNA double strand breaks (less MN) in a shorter time (decreased MD index). This intriguing finding imposes concern about the accuracy of repair, with respect to the cancer risk that is mediated by T genotypes. To date, . MSMB (microseminoprotein beta) is favored as the causal gene at the 10q11 risk locus, since it was the first candidate gene known to be expressionally altered by rs10993994. Based on the present observation, candidate genes from the contexts of DNA repair and apoptosis may be more promising targets for expression studies with respect to the rs10993994 genotype. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.9514625
10,"Good genes and the maternal effects of polyandry on offspring reproductive success in the bulb mite Genetic benefits are potentially the most robust explanation of the controversial issue of evolutionary maintenance of polyandry, but the unambiguous demonstration of such benefits has been hindered by the possibility of their confusion with maternal effects. Previous research has shown that polyandrous bulb mite females produce daughters with higher fecundity than monandrous females. Here, we investigate whether this effect arises because polyandrous females invest more in their offspring, or because their offspring inherit 'good genes' from their fathers. Females were mated with either one or four (different) males. However, by sterilizing three of the four males with ionizing radiation, we eliminated any chance of sexual selection (in the polyandrous treatment) so that any differences in the female mating regimes must have been owing to maternal effects. Polyandry had no significant effect on daughter fecundity, thus indicating that any previously documented effects must have been genetic. This was further supported by a significant association between fathers' offensive sperm-competitive ability and the fecundity of their daughters. The association with fathers' sperm defensive ability was not significant, and neither was the association between fathers' sperm competitiveness and sons' reproductive success. However, sons of polyandrous females had lower reproductive success than sons of monandrous females. This shows that the maternal effects of polyandry should be taken into account whenever its costs and benefits are being considered.",Excluded,0.95138544

We investigated whether PLE patients (n=22) were resistant to ultraviolet-radiation-induced immunosuppression compared to skin-type, aged-matched controls (n=23). Groups of patients and controls (six subjects per group) received a single dose of solar-simulated ultraviolet-radiation of either 0, 0.6, 1 or 2 minimal erythema doses (MED). Erythema was quantified using a reflectance meter and all volunteers were sensitised on the irradiated site with dinitrochlorobenzene.

783,"An approach to the assessment of risk from chronic radiation to populations of European lobster, Homarus gammarus (L.) The basic principles underlying a four-discrete age group, logistic, growth model for the European lobster Homarus gammarus are presented and discussed at proof-of-concept level. The model considers reproduction, removal by predation, natural death, fishing, radiation and migration. Non-stochastic effects of chronic low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation are modelled with emphasis on (99)Tc, using three endpoints: repairable radiation damage, impairment of reproductive ability and, at higher dose rates, mortality. An allometric approach for the calculation of LD(50/30) as a function of the mass of each life stage is used in model calibration. The model predicts that at a dose rate of 1 Gy day(-1), lobster population reproduction and survival become severely compromised, leading eventually to population extinction. At 0.01 Gy day(-1), the survival rate of an isolated population is reduced by 10%, mainly through loss of fecundity, comparable to natural migration losses. Fishing is the main ecological stress and only dose rates in the range 0.03-0.1 Gy day(-1) can achieve discernible effects above it. On the balance of radiation and other ecological stresses, a benchmark value of 0.01 Gy day(-1) is proposed for the protection of lobster populations. This value appears consistent with available information on radiation effects in wildlife.",Excluded,0.9510187

Totally, 120 patients with locally advanced lung cancer in radiotherapy were randomized into treatment and control groups. Patients in the treatment group took ambroxol orally at a dosage of 90 mg, three times per day for 3 months from the beginning of radiotherapy. The expression of TGF-beta1 and TNF-alpha in plasma was analyzed. The clinical symptoms and lung diffusing capacity were monitored using high resolving power computed tomography. The level of TGF-beta1 in the control group was increased (11.8 +/- 5.5 ng/ml), whereas in ambroxol-treated patients, the increase was not significant (5.6 +/- 2.6 ng/ml, P < 0.001). Radiotherapy-induced elevation of TNF-alpha levels, seen in control patients, was also abolished after treatment with ambroxol (5.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.8 ng/ml, P < 0.001). In the treatment group, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity was not significantly decreased at 6, 12, and 18 months post-radiotherapy, compared with the control group (P < 0.05).

Thirty-seven subjects with HNSCC and 35 healthy donors were enrolled in the study. The extent of DNA damage including oxidative lesions and efficiency of the repair were examined by alkaline comet assay. HNSCC cancer cells were more sensitive to genotoxic treatment and displayed impaired DNA repair. In particular, lesions caused by gamma-radiation were repaired less effectively in metastasis of HNSCC than in healthy controls. The differences in radiation sensitivity of cancer and control cells suggested that DNA repair might be critical for HNSCC treatment.

961,"RAD18 mediates resistance to ionizing radiation in human glioma cells Radioresistance remains a major challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). RAD18 a central regulator of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), has been shown to play an important role in regulating genomic stability and DNA damage response. In the present study, we investigate the relationship between RAD18 and resistance to ionizing radiation (IR) and examined the expression levels of RAD18 in primary and recurrent GBM specimens. Our results showed that RAD18 is an important mediator of the IR-induced resistance in GBM. The expression level of RAD18 in glioma cells correlates with their resistance to IR. Ectopic expression of RAD18 in RAD18-low A172 glioma cells confers significant resistance to IR treatment. Conversely, depletion of endogenous RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells sensitized these cells to IR treatment. Moreover, RAD18 overexpression confers resistance to IR-mediated apoptosis in RAD18-low A172 glioma cells, whereas cells deficient in RAD18 exhibit increased apoptosis induced by IR. Furthermore, knockdown of RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells disrupts HR-mediated repair, resulting in increased accumulation of DSB. In addition, clinical data indicated that RAD18 was significantly higher in recurrent GBM samples that were exposed to IR compared with the corresponding primary GBM samples. Collectively, our findings reveal that RAD18 may serve as a key mediator of the IR response and may function as a potential target for circumventing IR resistance in human GBM.

1065,"DNA double strand breaks but not interstrand crosslinks prevent progress through meiosis in fully grown mouse oocytes There is some interest in how mammalian oocytes respond to different types of DNA damage because of the increasing expectation of fertility preservation in women undergoing chemotherapy. Double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation and agents such as neocarzinostatin (NCS), and interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by alkylating agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), are toxic DNA lesions that need to be repaired for cell survival. Here we examined the effects of NCS and MMC treatment on oocytes collected from antral follicles in mice, because potentially such oocytes are readily collected from ovaries and do not need to be in vitro grown to achieve meiotic competency. We found that oocytes were sensitive to NCS, such that this ionizing radiation mimetic blocked meiosis I and caused fragmented DNA. In contrast, MMC had no impact on the completion of either meiosis I or II, even at extremely high doses. However, oocytes treated with MMC did show gamma-H2AX foci and following their in vitro maturation and parthenogenetic activation the development of the subsequent embryos was severely compromised. Addition of MMC to 1-cell embryos caused a similarly poor level of development, demonstrating oocytes have eventual sensitivity to this ICL-inducing agent but this does not occur during their meiotic division. In oocytes, the association of Fanconi Anemia protein, FANCD2, with sites of ICL lesions was not apparent until entry into the embryonic cell cycle. In conclusion, meiotic maturation of oocytes is sensitive to DSBs but not ICLs. The ability of oocytes to tolerate severe ICL damage and yet complete meiosis, means that this type of DNA lesion goes unrepaired in oocytes but impacts on subsequent embryo quality.",Excluded,0.9496921
47,"The Assessment of the Integrated Antioxidant System of the Body in the Course of Radon Therapy: A Pilot Study Introduction. The sources of Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) in the organism are the respiratory processes occurring in cells catalyzed by different enzymes. Operation of ROS is balanced by antioxidants, the compounds; although present in low concentrations, they significantly inhibit the degree of oxidation of particular molecules. The Aim of the Study. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in the integrated antioxidant system under the influence of radon therapy in osteoarthritis patients. Material and Methods. Observation included 35 patients suffering from degenerative joints and disc disease (mean age 56.5 years) undergoing radon water therapy and control group that consisted of 15 osteoarthritis patients (mean age 54.2) without contact with radon water. Before therapy and after 18 days of treatment, serum total antioxidant status (TAS) was assessed with the use of standard colorimetric assay. Results. In the study group, we observed trends to increase TAS concentration, whereas, in the control group, TAS concentration was decreasing. Conclusions. (1) Radon waters treatment influenced the level of TAS of osteoarthritis patients treated with the radon water. (2) The change in TAS concentrations in the study group may be the result of low doses of ionizing radiation, but further studies on larger patient's groups are demanded.

702,"Radiation protection by the Ocimum flavonoids orientin and vicenin: Mechanisms of action In previous studies, flavonoids, orientin and vicenin, that were isolated from the leaf extract of Ocimum sanctum, were found to protect mice against radiation injury. Several flavonoids are known to be good antioxidants. Therefore, the effect of orientin and vicenin on radiation-induced lipid peroxidation in vivo and their antioxidant activity in vitro were studied. Adult mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mug/kg of orientin or vicenin and exposed whole-body to 3 Gy of gamma radiation. Lipid peroxidation was measured in the liver 15 min to 8 h postirradiation. The antioxidant activity of orientin/vicenin (10-500 muM) was studied by measuring inhibition of hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction (Fe3+-EDTA-ascorbic acid-H2O2) in vitro. The compounds were also tested for possible pro-oxidant and iron chelation activities at the above concentrations in the in vitro system. Orientin and vicenin provided almost equal protection against radiation-induced lipid peroxidation in mouse liver. Both compounds showed a significantly greater free radical-inhibiting activity in vitro than DMSO. Neither orientin nor vicenin showed any pro-oxidant activity at the concentrations tested. Both compounds inhibited free radical formation in the absence of EDTA. Free radical scavenging appears to be a likely mechanism of radiation protection by these flavonoids.

349,"A Small Peptide Ac-SDKP Inhibits Radiation-Induced Cardiomyopathy BACKGROUND: Advances in radiotherapy for thoracic cancers have resulted in improvement of survival. However, radiation exposure to the heart can induce cardiotoxicity. No therapy is currently available to inhibit these untoward effects. We examined whether a small tetrapeptide, N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (Ac-SDKP), can counteract radiation-induced cardiotoxicity by inhibiting macrophage-dependent inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. METHODS AND RESULTS: After characterizing a rat model of cardiac irradiation with magnetic resonance imaging protocols, we examined the effects of Ac-SDKP in radiation-induced cardiomyopathy. We treated rats with Ac-SDKP for 18 weeks. We then compared myocardial contractile function and extracellular matrix by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and the extent of inflammation, fibrosis, and Mac-2 (galectin-3) release by tissue analyses. Because Mac-2 is a crucial macrophage-derived mediator of fibrosis, we performed studies to determine Mac-2 synthesis by macrophages in response to radiation, and change in profibrotic responses by Mac-2 gene depleted cardiac fibroblasts after radiation. Cardiac irradiation diminished myocardial contractile velocities and enhanced extracellular matrix deposition. This was accompanied by macrophage infiltration, fibrosis, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and cardiac Mac-2 expression. Ac-SDKP strongly inhibited these detrimental effects. Ac-SDKP migrated into the perinuclear cytoplasm of the macrophages and inhibited radiation-induced Mac-2 release. Cardiac fibroblasts lacking the Mac-2 gene showed reduced transforming growth factor beta1, collagen I, and collagen III expression after radiation exposure. CONCLUSION(S): Our study identifies novel cardioprotective effects of Ac-SDKP in a model of cardiac irradiation. These protective effects are exerted by inhibiting inflammation, fibrosis, and reducing macrophage activation. This study shows a therapeutic potential of this endogenously released peptide to counteract radiation-induced cardiomyopathy.",Excluded,0.9489158
468,"The use of a comprehensive tumour xenograft dataset to validate gene signatures relevant for radiation response PURPOSE: To investigate the use of xenograft models in a novel gene signature validation method using gene expression microarrays., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression profiles of ten human Head and Neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) were obtained. Several published prognostic gene expression signatures were evaluated within this set. These consisted of different radiotherapy relevant signatures (i.e. for hypoxia, proliferation and 'stemness'). Signatures were correlated with various endpoints that have been determined in the ten different xenograft models. These include immunohistochemical measures for hypoxia and proliferation, volume doubling time (VDT) and local tumour control after fractionated irradiation or after single dose irradiation under clamp hypoxia., RESULTS: We found several significant correlations between the published gene expression signatures and tumour parameters. Several signatures, like the proliferation and wound signature correlated with BrdU labelling index. Further a 'stemness'-related gene signature showed a strong negative correlation with hypoxic fraction., CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous assessment of immunohistochemistry, in vivo tumour properties and gene expression profiling in a comprehensive set of xenograft models can be used to validate and potentially infer biological information about prognostic gene signatures.",Excluded,0.94889325
869,"Host and tumor immunity: Local and systemic opportunities to enhance tumor curability by radiotherapy Success of radiation treatment depends on intrinsic properties of tumor cells, involvement of the host immune system and the crosstalk between tumor and host cells in primary and secondary (metastatic) sites. During the last decade our laboratory has investigated the role of these interactions in the ability of radiotherapy to eradicate primary tumors and metastatic disease. In the current presentation we will focus on host factors which interact with ionizing radiation (IR). The results of our studies using genetic models and specific immunological probes have identified CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, professional antigen presenting cells (CD11c+ dendritic cells), local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and host Type I Interferons (IFNs) as required for successful treatment by radiation 1,2. Transformation of the tumor microenvironment into an ""immunological hub"" to suppress local and distant disease is a tantalizing goal for which radiotherapy might be well suited, especially in combination with immunotherapy. , Our group has recently demonstrated that the combination of radiotherapy and anti-PD-L1 antibodies decrease accumulation and function of myeloid derived suppressor cells(CD11b,Gr1+) through enhanced local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs). in experimental systems3,4 The capacity of local radiotherapy to augment the activation TILs and drive cytokine production is, in part, due to the ability to increase tumor antigen cross-presentation by professional antigen presenting cells in the tumor stroma. Our group demonstrated host type I IFNs are essential for enhanced tumor antigen cross-presentation following radiotherapy. The critical role of type I IFNs in the host immune response to radiotherapy positions them as central components in the crosstalk between tumor cells and the host that can exert positive or negative influences depending on the context. In particular, the interaction of tumor cells with the host leads to the selection of clones resistant to the cytotoxic effects of IFNs and radiotherapy. Using transcriptomic approaches we identified a set of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) associated with tumor radioresistance.5 This gene set was identified in different types of primary tumors (lung, prostate, breast and glioblastoma) and termed the Interferon Related DNA Damage Signature (IRDS). Statistical training of this gene set detected a 7 gene signature which predicted response to adjuvant radio/chemotherapy for some woman with breast cancer 6. The IRDS is prognostic for patients with subsets of glioma and prostate cancer. We propose that these data indicate the presence of pro-survival genes in the IFN/Jak/Stat axis, which has been confirmed recently through a genomics approach The Jak-Stat pathway is currently under investigation as a potential therapeutic target for radio-chemosensitization in different tumor types. Our current approaches are directed towards identification of tumor ISGs with pro-survival/radioprotective functions. These results demonstrate the requirement to investigate both tumor and the host to improve the therapeutic ratio in radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.9484287
316,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma gene polymorphism in psoriasis and its relation to obesity, metabolic syndrome, and narrowband ultraviolet B response: A case-control study in Egyptian patients Background: Psoriasis is a common dermatologic disease with multifactorial etiology in which genetic factors play a major role. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma is expressed in keratinocytes and is known to affect cell maturation and differentiation in addition to its role in inflammation. Aim(s): To study the association between PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism and psoriasis vulgaris in Egyptian patients to explore if this polymorphism influenced disease risk or clinical presentation. Method(s): Forty-five patients with psoriasis vulgaris and 45 age, sex and body mass index matched healthy volunteers who have no present, past or family history of psoriasis as a control group were enrolled. Selected cases included obese and nonobese participants. Detection of PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism was done with restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction. Narrow-band ultraviolet B (NBUVB) was given for every case three times/week for 12 weeks. Result(s): Homopolymorphism, heteropolymorphism, and Ala allele were significantly associated with cases (P = 0.01, P = 0.01, and P = 0.004, respectively) and increased risk of occurrence of psoriasis by 5.25, 3.65, and 3.37 folds, respectively. Heteropolymorphism was significantly associated with nonobese cases compared to obese ones (P = 0.01). Ala allele was significantly associated with obese cases (P = 0.001) and increased risk of occurrence of psoriasis in obese participants by 1.14 folds. Homopolymorphism, heteropolymorphism, and Ala allele were more prevalent among obese cases without metabolic syndrome (MS) than obese cases with MS but without statistical significance. Percentage of decrease of mean Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score before and after 3 months of treatment with NBUVB was higher in cases with heteropolymorphism with no significant difference between homo- and heteropolymorphism. Conclusion(s): PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism is associated with and increased the risk of psoriasis and its associated obesity in Egyptian patients. It has no role in NBUVB response in those patients. Future large-scale studies on different populations are recommended.Copyright © 2019 Indian Journal of Dermatology Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Excluded,0.94704336

Latent, immediate-early, and early gene replicative viral transcripts were detected in samples from six astronauts who flew on short-duration Shuttle missions, whereas viral gene transcription was mostly absent in samples from 24 healthy donors. Samples from six astronauts who flew on long-duration ISS missions were characterized by expanded expression of latent, immediate-early, and early gene transcripts and new onset expression of late replicative transcription upon return to Earth. These data indicate that EBV-infected cells are no longer expressing the restricted set of viral genes that characterize latency but are expressing latent and lytic gene transcripts.

Materials and Methods Nine large U.S. medical institutions identified 208 former and current nuclear medicine technologists certified after 1979 and linked these individuals to historic badge dose records maintained by a commercial dosimetry company (Landauer), yielding a total of 2618 annual dose records. The distributions of annual and cumulative occupational doses were described by using summary statistics. Results Between 1992 and 2015, the median annual personal dose equivalent per nuclear medicine technologist was 2.18 mSv (interquartile range [IQR], 1.25-3.47 mSv; mean, 2.69 mSv). Median annual personal dose equivalents remained relatively constant over this period (range, 1.40-3.30 mSv), while maximum values generally increased over time (from 8.00 mSv in 1992 to 13.9 mSv in 2015). The median cumulative personal dose equivalent was 32.9 mSv (IQR, 18.1-65.5 mSv; mean, 51.4 mSv) for 45 technologists who had complete information and remained employed through 2015. Conclusion Occupational radiation doses were well below the established occupational limits and were consistent with those observed for nuclear medicine technologists worldwide and were greater than those observed for nuclear and general medical workers in the United States These results should be informative for radiation monitoring and safety efforts in nuclear medicine departments. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",Excluded,0.9452556

A total of 236 persons participated, belonging to 10 different professional groups and working at two Swedish power plants. Job-related radiation risks were judged about average as compared to a number of other risks. On the whole, the participants in the study were satisfied with the measures of safety at work, but there were some exceptions to this rule, especially among those hired for temporary jobs through external contractors. The experience of job-related radiation risks was related to the level of knowledge about radiation and its risks: those who knew less experienced larger risks. General level of anxiety did not correlate with risk perception. The latter was accounted for mainly by perceived radiation risks. Job satisfaction was more strongly related to perceived conventional job risks than to nuclear risks. Risk ratings were related to how subjects defined the concept of risk.

Methods and Materials: Data from 93 head and neck radiotherapy patients treated between 1997 and 2008 were analyzed retrospectively. The main effect, radiation dose to the individual teeth, was evaluated with covariates of elapsed time after radiation, xerostomia, topical fluoride use, and oral hygiene status included. Patients' radiotherapy plans were used to calculate cumulative exposure for each tooth. Patients' teeth were evaluated using a validated index and then categorized as having none-slight or moderate-severe post-radiation damage. Result(s): Patients (31 females, 62 males) ranged in age from 18-82 years (mean 57). The number of teeth-patient ranged from 3-30 (mean 20) with a total of 1873 teeth evaluated. Overall, 51% of teeth had moderate-severe damage, with the remaining having little or none. Using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, the odds for moderate-severe damage were 2-3 times greater for teeth exposed to between 30 and 60 Gy as compared to no radiation. However, for teeth exposed to >= 60 Gy as compared to no radiation the odds of moderate-severe tooth damage was greater by a magnitude of 10 times. Conclusion(s): The results indicate that there is minimal tooth damage below 30 Gy (salivary gland threshold), a greater than 1:1 increased dose-response between 30 and 60 Gy likely related to salivary gland damage, and a critical threshold of >= 60 Gy, which may be linked to direct effects of radiation on tooth structure.

T helper cells 17 (Th 17) and T regulatory cells (Tregs) play an important role in inflammatory diseases. The balance between Treg and Th17 cells is a key factor in the progression of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Whether Tregs and Th17 cells are predictive factors of radiation pneumonia has not yet been reported. In this study, we investigated the relationships of Treg/Th17 cells and radiation pneumonia in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: One hundred and forty-eight patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received radical and palliative radiotherapy were enrolled. The levels of Th17 and Treg cells in the blood of patients were detected using flow cytometry at the time point of pre-radiotherapy, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th week from the start of radiation and 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Radiation pneumonia was evaluated according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group's acute radiation pneumonia standards, with the endpoint being grade 2 or above radiation pneumonia.

957,"Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase Upregulation by Phenylephrine Reduces Radiation Injury in Submandibular Gland PURPOSE: Radiation therapy for head and neck cancer commonly leads to radiation sialadenitis. Emerging evidence has indicated that phenylephrine pretreatment reduces radiosensitivity in the salivary gland; however, the underlying cytoprotective mechanism remains unclear. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is not only a key enzyme for the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide salvage pathway, but also a cytokine participating in cell survival, metabolism, and longevity, with a broad effect on cellular functions in physiology and pathology. However, the regulatory events of NAMPT in response to the irradiated salivary gland are unknown., METHODS AND MATERIALS: The cell viability of primary cultured submandibular gland cells was determined using the PrestoBlue assay. NAMPT expression was measured using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting in vitro and in vivo. Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and phosphorylated Akt protein levels were examined by Western blotting. The cellular locations of NAMPT and SIRT1 were detected by immunohistochemistry. NAMPT promoter activity was assessed using the luciferase reporter gene assay., RESULTS: NAMPT was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of granular convoluted tubule cells and ductal cells in normal submandibular glands. mRNA and protein expression of NAMPT was downregulated after radiation but upregulated with phenylephrine pretreatment both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the protein expression of phosphorylated Akt and SIRT1 was decreased in irradiated glands, and phenylephrine pretreatment restored the expression of both. SIRT1 was mainly located in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm in the normal submandibular gland. Phenylephrine dramatically enhanced the expression of SIRT1, which was significantly reduced by radiation. Furthermore, phenylephrine induced a marked increase of NAMPT promoter activity., CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the regulatory mechanisms of NAMPT expression, which help to understand the mechanism of the cytoprotective role of phenylephrine on irradiated tissues.

842,"T95 nucleophosmin phosphorylation as a novel mediator and marker of regulated cell death in acute kidney injury The function of site-specific phosphorylation of nucleophosmin (NPM), an essential Bax chaperone, in stress-induced cell death is unknown. We hypothesized that NPM threonine 95 (T95) phosphorylation both signals and promotes cell death. In resting cells, NPM exclusively resides in the nucleus and T95 is nonphosphorylated. In contrast, phosphorylated T95 NPM (pNPM T95) accumulates in the cytosol after metabolic stress, in multiple human cancer cell lines following gamma-radiation, and in postischemic human kidney tissue. Based on the T95 phosphorylation consensus sequence, we hypothesized that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) regulates cytosolic NPM translocation by phosphorylating T95 NPM. In a cell-free system, GSK-3beta phosphorylated a synthetic NPM peptide containing T95. In vitro, bidirectional manipulation of GSK-3beta activity substantially altered T95 phosphorylation, cytosolic NPM translocation, and cell survival during stress, mechanistically linking these lethal events. Furthermore, GSK-3beta inhibition in vivo decreased cytosolic pNPM T95 accumulation in kidney tissue after experimental ischemia. In patients with acute kidney injury, both cytosolic NPM accumulation in proximal tubule cells and NPM-rich intratubular casts were detected in frozen renal biopsy tissue. These observations show, for the first time, that GSK-3beta promotes cell death partly by phosphorylating NPM at T95, to promote cytosolic NPM accumulation. T95 NPM is also a rational therapeutic target to ameliorate ischemic renal cell injury and may be a universal injury marker in mammalian cells.Copyright © 2020 the American Physiological Society",Excluded,0.94009703

RESULT(S): On the 10th day after the trauma, the mean epithelalized area was (34.17 +/- 0.37) mm2 and the mean number of microvessels/high power field was (10.25 +/- 2.34) in the treated group, whereas both were (26.25 +/- 0.20) mm2 and (4.38 +/- 0.92) respectivety in the control group. There was a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). On the 7th and 14th days after the trauma, the mean epithelialized area in the treated group was significantly different from that of the control group. The measurement by the image cytometry showed that the treated group had a mean nuclear peak area value of (38.28 +/- 7.23) micron 2 and the mean S-stage cell value of (31.28 +/- 10.35)%, and those of the control group were (28.02 +/- 8.13) micron 2 and (20.14 +/- 9.46)% respectively. There were significant differences (P < 0.05) between them. CONCLUSION(S): Application of bFGF can, to a certain extent, accelerate the repair of irradiated and surgically injured soft tissue.",Excluded,0.9388168
1154,"Carotid sparing intensity-modulated radiation therapy achieves comparable locoregional control to conventional radiotherapy in T1-2N0 laryngeal carcinoma Background Although intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is a standard of care for many head and neck cancers, its use for carotid-sparing (CS) therapy in early-stage laryngeal carcinoma is controversial. Methods 330 consecutive patients with early-stage laryngeal carcinoma were treated from 1/1989 to 5/2011, including 282 conventional radiotherapy (CRT) and 48 CS-IMRT patients. The median follow-up was 43 (CS-IMRT) and 66 (CRT) months. Results There was no difference in local failure rates comparing patients undergoing CS-IMRT with CRT, with 3-year local control rates of 88% vs. 89%, respectively (p = 0.938). Using a 1 cm circumferential margin, the average dose to the left and right carotid arteries was 48.3 and 47.9 Gy, respectively. 88% of locoregional recurrences involved the ipsilateral true vocal cord, including all local recurrences in the IMRT group. Conclusions These results warrant further prospective evaluation of CS-IMRT for early-stage glottic larynx cancer.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.93863255

1096,"DNA damage-induced PARP1 activation confers cardiomyocyte dysfunction through NAD+ depletion in experimental atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical tachyarrhythmia with a strong tendency to progress in time. AF progression is driven by derailment of protein homeostasis, which ultimately causes contractile dysfunction of the atria. Here we report that tachypacing-induced functional loss of atrial cardiomyocytes is precipitated by excessive poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) activation in response to oxidative DNA damage. PARP1-mediated synthesis of ADP-ribose chains in turn depletes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), induces further DNA damage and contractile dysfunction. Accordingly, NAD+ replenishment or PARP1 depletion precludes functional loss. Moreover, inhibition of PARP1 protects against tachypacing-induced NAD+ depletion, oxidative stress, DNA damage and contractile dysfunction in atrial cardiomyocytes and Drosophila. Consistently, cardiomyocytes of persistent AF patients show significant DNA damage, which correlates with PARP1 activity. The findings uncover a mechanism by which tachypacing impairs cardiomyocyte function and implicates PARP1 as a possible therapeutic target that may preserve cardiomyocyte function in clinical AF.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.9359922
1085,"Intraoperative radiotherapy for parotid cancer: A single-institution experience Purpose: Our practice policy has been to provide intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) at resection to patients with head-and-neck malignancies considered to be at high risk of recurrence. The purpose of the present study was to review our experience with the use of IORT for primary or recurrent cancer of the parotid gland. Methods and Materials: Between 1982 and 2007, 96 patients were treated with gross total resection and IORT for primary or recurrent cancer of the parotid gland. The median age was 62.9 years (range, 14.3-88.1). Of the 96 patients, 33 had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy as a component of definitive therapy. Also, 34 patients had positive margins after surgery, and 40 had perineural invasion. IORT was administered as a single fraction of 15 or 20 Gy with 4-6-MeV electrons. The median follow-up period was 5.6 years. Result(s): Only 1 patient experienced local recurrence, 19 developed regional recurrence, and 12 distant recurrence. The recurrence-free survival rate at 1, 3, and 5 years was 82.0%, 68.5%, and 65.2%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rate after surgery and IORT was 88.4%, 66.1%, and 56.2%, respectively. No perioperative fatalities occurred. Complications developed in 26 patients and included vascular complications in 7, trismus in 6, fistulas in 4, radiation osteonecrosis in 4, flap necrosis in 2, wound dehiscence in 2, and neuropathy in 1. Of these 26 patients, 12 had recurrent disease, and 8 had undergone external beam radiotherapy before IORT. Conclusion(s): IORT results in effective local disease control at acceptable levels of toxicity and should be considered for patients with primary or recurrent cancer of the parotid gland. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.9352587
299,"Survival of patients with metastases of Hurthle cell thyroid carcinom Introduction: It is generally believed that patients with Hurthle cell thyroid carcinoma (HCTC) have poor prognosis. Furthermore, distant metastases represent the most frequent cause of thyroid cancer-related death of patients with HCTC. The aim of this study was to report outcomes of patients with distant metastases. Method(s): Altogether 109 patients were treated because of HCTC during the period from 1972 to 2011 in our tertiary center and 33 patients (19 females, 14 males; median age 69 years) had either initially metastatic disease (N=12; 9 females, 3 males; median age 66.5 years) or distant progression of HCTC after initial treatment (N=21; 10 females, 11 males; median age 70 years). Patients with metastases were followed for 1-201 (mean 66, median 41) months. The data on gender and age of the patients, disease history, extent of disease, morphologic characteristics, mode of therapy, outcome, and survival were collected. Statistical correlation between possible prognostic factors and cause-specific survival from time of detection of metastases was analyzed by univariate analysis and log-rank test. Result(s): Single organ and multiple organ metastases were diagnosed in 29 and 4 cases, respectively. The most common were lung metastases, followed by bone, mediastinum, kidney and liver in 26, 8, 2, 2 and 1 case, respectively. Total thyroidectomy, lobectomy, subtotal thyroidectomy and neck dissection were performed in 19, 11, 3 and 7 patients, respectively. Radioiodine (RAI) ablation of thyroid remnant was performed in 28 patients, while 27 patients had RAI therapy (median 2 times). Two or more RAI therapies were applied in 18 patients. Chemotherapy and external irradiation was used in 12 and 19 patients, respectively. Locoregional control of disease was achieved in 18/21 (86%) cases who succumbed due to HCTC. Eleven patients are alive and one lost from follow-up. Median disease-specific survival for all patients, pulmonary, bone, single organ, multiple organ metastases, initially metastatic and metastatic after disease-free interval was 41, 41, 93, 36, 141, 131 and 26 months, respectively. 5-year disease-specific survival for all patients, pulmonary, bone, single organ and multiple organ metastases was 42%, 46%, 57%, 32% and 100%, respectively. 10-year disease-specific survival for all patients, pulmonary, bone, single organ and multiple organ metastases was 28%, 29%, 43%, 25% and 66%, respectively.

This study was conducted to define the exact doses resulting in radiation-induced liver diseases (RILD) and dose constraints for the critical organs at risk (OARs) in mice, which are still undefined in HCC SBRT. Materials/Methods: This study was consisted of 2 phases. In the primary phase, mice treated with helical tomotherapy based SBRT were stratified according to escalating radiation doses to the livers. Pathological differences, signs, such as mouse performance status (MPS), and serum aspartate/ alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT)/albumin levels were observed. Radiation-induced disease severities of OARs were scored using systematic evaluation standards. In the validation phase in human, 13 patients with HCC who had undergone radiation therapy before hepatectomy were enrolled to validate RILD pathological changes in mice study. Result(s): Evaluation criteria of mouse liver radiation therapy relating signs were as follows: MPS >=2.0+/-0.52, AST/ALT >=589.2+/-118.5/137.4+/-15.3 U/L, serum albumin <=16.8+/-2.29 g/L. Preliminary dose constraints of OARs had also been obtained, such as livers: average dose <=26.36+/-1.71 Gy and gastrointestinal tract: maximum dose <=22.63 Gy. Mouse RILD models could be developed when livers were irradiated with the average doses >=31.76+/-1.94 Gy (single fraction). RILD pathological changes in mice had also been validated in HCC patients.

37,"Small Cell Lung Cancer. Methodology and Preliminary Results of the SMALL CELL Study INTRODUCTION: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive histologic type of lung cancer, and accounts for approximately 10%-15% of all cases. Few studies have analyzed the effect of residential radon. Our aim is to determine the risk factors of SCLC., METHODS: We designed a multicenter, hospital-based case-control study with the participation of 11 hospitals in 4 autonomous communities., RESULTS: Results of the first 113 cases have been analyzed, 63 of which included residential radon measurements. Median age at diagnosis was 63 years; 11% of cases were younger than 50 years of age; 22% were women; 57% had extended disease; and 95% were smokers or former smokers. Median residential radon concentration was 128Bq/m3. Concentrations higher than 400Bq/m3 were found in 8% of cases. The only remarkable difference by gender was the percentage of never smokers, which was higher in women compared to men (P<.001). Radon concentration was higher in patients with stageIV disease (non-significant difference) and in individuals diagnosed at 63 years of age or older (P=.032)., CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of SCLC cases are diagnosed early and there is a predominance of disseminated disease at diagnosis. Residential radon seems to play an important role on the onset of this disease, with some cases having very high indoor radon concentrations. Copyright © 2017 SEPAR.

The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) treatment of pituitary adenomas that have invaded the cavernous sinus. Methods. Sixteen patients were treated with GKS: three with nonfunctional adenomas and 13 with hormone-secreting (seven growth hormone [GH] and six adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) adenomas. More than 16 Gy and 30 Gy were delivered to the tumor margin for nonfunctioning tumors and functioning tumors, respectively, keeping the dose to the optic pathways below 10 Gy. The median follow up was 3 years. Tumor growth control was achieved in all cases. In GH-producing tumors, four of six cases evaluated were endocrinologically normalized (serum GH < 10 mIU/L, somatomedin C < 450 ng/ml), and the remaining two cases also showed a steady decrease in the GH and somatomedin level. In ACTH-producing tumors, three of six cases were endocrinologically normalized (24-hour urinary-free cortisol < 90 mg/day), two were unchanged, and one showed hormonal recurrence 3 years after radiosurgery. Notably, there were no cases of permanent hypopituitarism or visual symptoms caused by radiosurgery. Conclusions. The authors data indicate that GKS can be a safe salvage therapy for invading pituitary adenomas, with effectiveness equivalent to conventional radiation therapy but with less risk of causing radiation-induced injury to the surrounding structures.",Excluded,0.926234

METHOD(S): From January 1996 to January 2000, 380 NPC patients were divided into conventional fraction (CF-175 patients), late-course accelerated hyperfractionation (LCAF-63 patients) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT-142 patients) groups. Conventional radiotherapy was given with a total dose of 70 Gy. Patients in the LCAF group were treated with the same fractionation as CF group until the dose of 36 - 40 Gy, then followed by LCAF radiotherapy to a total dose of 75 Gy. IMRT in the form of full-course was given to a total dose of 72 Gy. Acute parotiditis was observed during the treatment. The parotid secretory function was examined 2 years after radiotherapy. RESULT(S): The dose of parotid in IMRT was much lower than those in the other 2 groups. Extreme damage rates of parotid secretory function in CF, LCAF and IMRT groups were 81.7%, 81.0% and 69.7% (P < 0.05); acute parotiditis rates were 23.4%, 20.4% and 41.3% respectively, with the differences among the 3 groups significant (P < 0.05).

771,"Salivary and serum proteomics in head and neck carcinomas: Before and after surgery and radiotherapy Several body fluids have been evaluated as new sources for cancer biomarker discovery. In this context, salivary and serum proteomics seem promising diagnostic and predictive tools for head and neck diseases. In the present study, we performed a proteomic analysis of saliva and serum from patients presenting head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and compared the results before and after therapy. In saliva of cancer patients, we observed an altered protein profile, including over-expression of PLUNC and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein. Both proteins may contribute to control tumor growth and, therefore, represent targets for new analysis. We also detected serotransferrin and a modified transthyretin form with altered levels in serum from patients. Comparing preoperative and postreatment samples, the results showed that the protein profile after treatment reverted to a pattern closer to those observed for controls. These results add information on the role of secreted proteins in the cancer process and emphasize the potential of saliva and serum analysis for diagnosis and monitoring of HNSCC. © 2010/2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

Outcomes with conventional fractionation (2-2.4 Gy per fraction; n = 27) were compared to hypofractionation (4-6 Gy per fraction; n = 36). The primary endpoint was local control and the secondary endpoint was toxicity., RESULTS: Comparable local control rates were found after 2 and 5 years (63% vs 64% and 47% vs 53%; P = .73 for, respectively, conventional fractionation vs hypofractionation). Local recurrences were predominantly present ipsilateral (92%) and within the irradiated volume (88%). Late toxicity grade >= 3 was observed in 2 of 63 patients, 1 patient in both groups., CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy fractionation schedule did not influence the local control rate or the incidence of late toxicity in patients treated with surgery and RT for sinonasal malignant melanoma in this retrospective analysis. Due to this retrospective nature and the limited number of patients, strong recommendations cannot be made. Expected toxicity, patient convenience, and workload may be taken into account for the choice of fractionation schedule until conclusive evidence becomes available.

In multivariate analysis, decreasing time from the first diagnosis of bladder carcinoma to radiation treatment and 1 or more transurethral resections was associated with a significant increase in survival; increases in T category and sedimentation rate were negative prognostic factors. Although both radiation dose and CRE levels had a significant effect on survival in univariate analysis, an increase in CRE levels alone was associated with a significant increase in survival in multivariate analysis. However, the most important predictor of survival was whether the patient showed a complete local response or not.

1055,"YWHAZ amplification/overexpression defines aggressive bladder cancer and contributes to chemo-/radio-resistance by suppressing caspase-mediated apoptosis The objective of this study was to characterize the oncogenic actions of a recently identified cancer-associated gene YWHAZ (also named as 14-3-3 zeta/delta) in urothelial carcinomas of the urinary bladder (UCUB). A genome-wide study revealed YWHAZ to be involved in the amplicon at 8q22.3, and its genetic amplification was detected predominantly in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the association of YWHAZ overexpression with higher tumor stages, lymph node/vascular invasion, and mitotic activity. Univariate and multivariate analyses further indicated the prognostic potential of YWHAZ for more aggressive cancer types. Both gene set enrichment analysis and STRING network studies suggested involvement of YWHAZ in regulating caspase-mediated apoptosis. Ectopic expression of YWHAZ in bladder cells with low endogenous YWHAZ levels boosted cell resistance to doxorubicin and cisplatin, as well as to ionizing radiation. Conversely, YWHAZ-knockdown using specific shRNA in cells with high endogenous YWHAZ levels diminished survival activity, suppressing cell growth and increasing cell death. Our findings confirm the essential role played by YWHAZ in sustaining cell proliferation during chemo/radiotherapy. Treatments based on anti-YWHAZ strategies may thus be beneficial for UCUB patients overexpressing YWHAZ. © 2019 The Authors.

54,"ATM and p53 combined analysis predicts survival in glioblastoma multiforme patients: A clinicopathologic study Glioblastoma is one of the most malignant cancers, with a distinguishing dismal prognosis: surgery followed by chemo- and radiotherapy represents the current standard of care, and chemo- and radioresistance underlie disease recurrence and short overall survival of patients suffering from this malignancy. ATM is a kinase activated by autophosphorylation upon DNA doublestrand breaks arising from errors during replication, byproducts of metabolism, chemotherapy or ionizing radiations; TP53 is one of the most popular tumor suppressor, with a preeminent role in DNA damage response and repair. To study the effects of the immunohistochemical expression of p-ATM and p53 in glioblastoma patients, 21 cases were retrospectively examined. In normal brain tissue, p-ATM was expressed only in neurons; conversely, in tumors cells, the protein showed a variable cytoplasmic expression (score: +,++,+++), with being completely undetectable in three cases. Statistical analysis revealed that high p-ATM score (++/+++) strongly correlated to shorter survival (P = 0.022). No difference in overall survival was registered between p53 normally expressed (NE) and overexpressed (OE) glioblastoma patients (P = 0.669). Survival analysis performed on the results from combined assessment of the two proteins showed that patients with NE p53 /low pATM score had longer overall survival than the NE p53/ high pATM score counterpart. Cox-regression analysis confirmed this finding (HR = 0.025; CI 95% = 0.002-0.284; P = 0.003). Our study outlined the immunohistochemical expression of p-ATM/p53 in glioblastomas and provided data on their possible prognostic/predictive of response role.

The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for LNN and develop a model to predict LNN after radical re-irradiation with IMRT in patients with recurrent NPC., METHODS: Patients who underwent radical re-irradiation with IMRT for locally recurrent NPC between March 2001 and December 2011 and who had no evidence of distant metastasis were included in this study. Clinical characteristics, including recurrent carcinoma conditions and dosimetric features, were evaluated as candidate risk factors for LNN. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors and construct the predictive scoring model., RESULTS: Among 228 patients enrolled in this study, 204 were at risk of developing LNN based on risk analysis. Of the 204 patients treated, 31 (15.2%) developed LNN. Logistic regression analysis showed that female sex (P = 0.008), necrosis before re-irradiation (P = 0.008), accumulated total prescription dose to the gross tumor volume (GTV) >=145.5 Gy (P = 0.043), and recurrent tumor volume >=25.38 cm(3) (P = 0.009) were independent risk factors for LNN. A model to predict LNN was then constructed that included these four independent risk factors., CONCLUSIONS: A model that includes sex, necrosis before re-irradiation, accumulated total prescription dose to GTV, and recurrent tumor volume can effectively predict the risk of developing LNN in NPC patients who undergo radical re-irradiation with IMRT.",Excluded,0.90763324
307,"Experience with higher doses of radiotherapy in the postoperative treatment of glioblastoma multiforme: A single institutional report Background: Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly aggressive tumour with median survival of approximately 14 months. Management consists of maximal surgical resection followed by postoperative chemoradiation with concurrent then adjuvant temozolamide. The standard radiotherapy dose is 60 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. Most tumour recurrences occur within the previous irradiation field. Regimens designed to deliver higher radiation dose to improve local control and enhance survival warrant investigation. Method(s): We report a single institutional experience of treatment of consecutive patients with glioblastoma multiforme, treated with resection, postoperative radiotherapy followed by concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy. Finding(s): Of the 80 patients who entered the study, 68 completed the treatment course; there were 45 (66.2 %) male and 23 (33.8%) female patients with a mean age at diagnosis of 48.97 +/- 12.85 (21-75) years. At a median follow up of 19 months, 39 (57.3%) patients had evidence of tumour progression and 36 (52.9%) patients had died. Median overall survival for all patients was 16 months and progression-free survival for all patients was 6.02 months. All potential prognostic factors were analysed to evaluate their effects on overall survival. age of 50 years or younger, concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy, and extent of surgery were significant. We noted a lower progression rate among patients who received higher doses of radiotherapy (>60 Gy; p = 0.03). Overall survival was also increased, but this was not significant.

Aim of this study was to evaluate whether TRAIL - in a soluble isoleucine zippered form - enhances the cytotoxic effect of irradiation on tumour cells with a blockade in the mitochondrial apoptosis route and/or a dysfunctional p53 pathway. Material(s) and Method(s): The p53 mutant human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia line Jurkat transduced with the Bcl-2 gene was used as model system in vitro and in a subcutaneous transplant setting in immunodeficient mice. Sensitivity to single and combined treatment was read out by apoptosis hallmarks and clonogenic survival in vitro, and by bioluminescence and palpation in vivo. Result(s): Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 did not undergo apoptosis after irradiation, but the combination with TRAIL synergistically induced apoptosis without breaking mitochondrial resistance. TRAIL also reduced clonogenic survival after irradiation. In vivo, radiotherapy or TRAIL alone delayed tumour outgrowth, but combination treatment had the most profound effect. Conclusion(s): Isoleucine zippered TRAIL can strongly enhance the efficacy of tumour therapy with ionising radiation in an unfavourable setting of p53 mutation and Bcl-2 overexpression. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

All the patients examined were maintained within 4 weeks on a diet, radioprotective effect of which was realized due to the elevated content of sulfur containing amino acids, antioxidants and complexes. In the patients who lived in the radionuclide-contaminated areas, a moderate activation of lipid peroxidation was detected simultaneously with marked alterations in the humoral component of the immunity system, which involved a considerable increase in the levels of IgG and complements C3 and C4. A decrease in content of malonic dialdehyde and diene conjugates as well as normalization of IgG and decrease in content of IgA, IgM and C3 were observed in blood plasma of the patients on diet. Supplementation of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega 3-PUFA), 5 g/day and alpha-tocopherol, 12.5 mg/day, to the diet elevated the serum concentrations of all lg classes, which suggests the presence of an immunomodulating effect of omega 3-PUFA. Moreover, the content of malonic dialdehyde was not increased in blood plasma if 3-PUFA was used. Hence, increased alpha-tocopherol levels should be used in the treatment of these patients with omega 3-PUFA (up to 5-7 mg per g PUFA) in order to stabilize lipid peroxidation.",Excluded,0.9048735

The degree of radiographic joint damage was calculated from x-rays using the Sharp-van der Heijde Score (SHS) at baseline and at month 12. Results Mean DAS28 (SD) significantly decreased from 5.36 (1.42) at baseline to 3.09 (1.52) at month 3 (n=59) and to 2.69 (1.19) at month 12 (n=40), respectively (p<0.0001). Of the 40 patients with available radiographs, 9 (23%) showed an increase in SHS (SHS >0) after 12 months. The levels of serum S100A4 protein were significantly higher in patients with recent-onset RA compared to healthy controls (646.60+/-602.60 vs. 46.97+/-30.12 ng/ml; p<0.001) and significantly decreased after 3 months of treatment (to 388.10+/-521.00; p<0.001). There was positive correlation of baseline levels of S100A4 with IgM-RF (r=0.611; p<0.0001) and ACPA levels (r=0.471; p<0.001). After adjustment for IgM-RF, the levels of S100A4 at baseline (r=0.403; p<0.05) as well as at month 3 (r=0.548; p<0.01) were positively correlated with DAS28 after 12 months of treatment in female patients (n=28). There was no correlation in male patients. The levels of S100A4 did not correlate with disease activity at baseline or with the change of disease activity over time. Furthermore, there was no association between baseline levels or changes of SA100A4 and achievement of DAS28 remission or radiographic progression. Conclusions Our results indicate that circulating S100A4 levels are significantly higher in patients with recent-onset RA compared to healthy individuals and that higher S100A4 levels at baseline or at month 3 might have predictive potential for worse treatment response at month 12, at least in female patients with recent-onset RA.",Excluded,0.90370154
48,"Survival curves after X-ray and heat treatments for melanoma cells derived directly from surgical specimens of tumours in man X-ray and heat survival curves were established for melanoma cells derived directly from surgical specimens of tumours in man by using the Courtenay soft agar colony assay. The plating efficiency for 11 of the 14 melanomas studied was sufficiently high (PE = 0.3-58%) to measure cell survival over at least two decades. Experiments repeated with cells stored in liquid nitrogen showed that the survival assay gave highly reproducible results. The melanomas exhibited individual and characteristic survival curves whether exposed to radiation or heat (43.5 degrees C). The Do-values were in the ranges 0.63-1.66 Gy (X-rays) and 33-58 min (heat). The survival curves were similar to those reported previously for human melanoma xenografts. The radiation sensitivity of the cells was not correlated to the heat sensitivity. Since the melanomas appeared to be very heterogeneous in radiation response in vitro as melanomas are known to be clinically, it is suggested that melanomas may be suitable for prospective studies aimed at establishing whether clinical radioresponsiveness somehow is related to in vitro survival curve parameters.",Excluded,0.90240425
25,"A Novel In Vivo Protocol for Molecular Study of Radiation-Induced Fibrosis in Head and Neck Cancer Patients OBJECTIVES: Radiation-induced fibrosis is a common complication for patients following head and neck cancer treatment. This study presents a novel minimally invasive protocol for molecular study of fibrosis in the stromal tissues., METHODS: Subjects with radiation-induced fibrosis in the head and neck who were at least 6 months post treatment received submental core needle biopsies, followed by molecular processing and quantification of gene expression for 14 select pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes. Control biopsies from the upper arm were obtained from the same subjects. Patients were followed up at 1 and 2 weeks to monitor for safety and adverse outcomes., RESULTS: Six subjects were enrolled and completed the study. No subjects experienced adverse outcomes or complication. An 18 gauge core biopsy needle with a 10 mm notch inserted for up to 60 seconds was needed. Subcutaneous tissue yielded 3 ng of RNA, amplified to 6 microg of cDNA, allowing for adequately sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of approximately 28 genes., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the safety and utility of a novel technique for the molecular study of fibrosis in head and neck cancer patients. Longitudinal studies of patients undergoing radiation therapy will allow for identification of molecular targets that contribute to the process of fibrosis in the head and neck.

603,"Improved local control for early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma--a tale of two hospitals PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of intracavitary brachytherapy (ICT) in early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: All early T-stage (T1 and T2 nasal cavity tumour) NPC treated with a curative intent up to 1996 were analyzed (n=743), 163 from the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) and 25 from Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH) were given ICT after radical external radiotherapy (ERT; group A). They were compared with 555 patients treated with ERT alone (group B). The radiotherapy techniques were identical between the two hospitals. The ERT delivered the tumoricidal dose (uncorrected biological equivalent dose (BED)-10, > or = 75 Gy) to the primary tumour, and this did not differ in technique or dosage between the two groups. The ICT delivered a dose of 18-24 Gy in three fractions over 15 days to a point 1 cm perpendicular to the midpoint of the plane of the sources., RESULTS: The local failure was significantly less (crude rates, 6.9 vs. 13.0%; 5-year actuarial rates, 5.8 vs. 11.7%) and the disease-specific mortality was significantly lower (crude rates, 13.8 vs. 18.9%; 5-year actuarial rates, 12.2 vs. 15.2%) in group A compared with group B. ICT was the only significant independent prognostic factor predictive of fewer local failures. When ICT was excluded from the Cox regression model, the total physical dose or the total BED-10 uncorrected for tumour repopulation became significant in predicting the ultimate local failure rate. The two groups were comparable in the rate of the chronic radiation complications. A significant dose-tumour-control relationship existed, plotting the local failure as a function of the total physical dose or the total BED., CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing ERT, which delivered the tumoricidal dose (uncorrected BED-10, > or = 75 Gy), with ICT significantly enhanced ultimate local control in early T-stage (T1/T2 nasal infiltration) NPC. A significant dose-tumour-control relationship exists above the conventional tumoricidal dose level.",Excluded,0.90017503
833,"Safety and effectiveness of de-escalated radiation dose in T1-3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A propensity matched analysis Backgrounds: With the excellent local control in T1 to T3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), the importance of toxicities is increasingly being recognised. This retrospective propensity score analysis sought to assess whether moderate dose reduction compromised long-term outcome compared with standard dose in T1-3 NPCs. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 266 patients (67 female, 199 male) with a median age of 50 years between June 2011 and June 2015 were analysed. All were treated with IMRT, with or without systemic chemotherapy. The prescription radiation dose to gross tumor is 70Gy/2.12Gy/33F in our institution. Result(s): With a median follow-up time of 50 months, the 5-year loco-regional failure-free survival (LRFS) and overall survival (OS) were 93.5% and 81.8%, respectively. 32 patients received radiation dose less than prescription dose, with a median dose of 63.6Gy (53-67Gy). Another 234 patients received exactly the prescription dose of 70Gy. Propensity scores were computed (32 patients treated with de-escalated dose and 64 patients with standard dose), there was no significant difference in 5-year LRFS and 5-year OS between the two groups (92.5% and 91.7% with standard dose; 82.1% and 85.7% with de-escalation dose; p=0.863 for LRFS and 0.869 for OS). No independent prognostic factor was associated with loco-regional failure in univariate analysis. Conclusion(s): T1-3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma presenting with superior locoregional control, a moderately reduced dose (about 10%) delivered with IMRT resulted in comparable prognosis to those with prescription dose of 70Gy.Copyright © The author(s).",Excluded,0.8986777
175,"Study of 201 non-small cell lung cancer patients given stereotactic ablative radiation therapy shows local control dependence on dose calculation algorithm PURPOSE: Pencil beam (PB) and collapsed cone convolution (CCC) dose calculation algorithms differ significantly when used in the thorax. However, such differences have seldom been previously directly correlated with outcomes of lung stereotactic ablative body radiation (SABR)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data for 201 non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with SABR were analyzed retrospectively. All patients were treated with 50 Gy in 5 fractions of 10 Gy each. The radiation prescription mandated that 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) receive the prescribed dose. One hundred sixteen patients were planned with BrainLab treatment planning software (TPS) with the PB algorithm and treated on a Novalis unit. The other 85 were planned on the Pinnacle TPS with the CCC algorithm and treated on a Varian linac. Treatment planning objectives were numerically identical for both groups. The median follow-up times were 24 and 17 months for the PB and CCC groups, respectively. The primary endpoint was local/marginal control of the irradiated lesion. Gray's competing risk method was used to determine the statistical differences in local/marginal control rates between the PB and CCC groups., RESULTS: Twenty-five patients planned with PB and 4 patients planned with the CCC algorithms to the same nominal doses experienced local recurrence. There was a statistically significant difference in recurrence rates between the PB and CCC groups (hazard ratio 3.4 [95% confidence interval: 1.18-9.83], Gray's test P=.019). The differences (DELTA) between the 2 algorithms for target coverage were as follows: DELTAD99GITV = 7.4 Gy, DELTAD99PTV = 10.4 Gy, DELTAV90GITV = 13.7%, DELTAV90PTV = 37.6%, DELTAD95PTV = 9.8 Gy, and DELTADISO = 3.4 Gy. GITV = gross internal tumor volume., CONCLUSIONS: Local control in patients receiving who were planned to the same nominal dose with PB and CCC algorithms were statistically significantly different. Possible alternative explanations are described in the report, although they are not thought likely to explain the difference. We conclude that the difference is due to relative dosimetric underdosing of tumors with the PB algorithm. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.8907717

Methods and Materials: Neuropsychological testing (IQ, attention [modified Trail- Making Test A, Digit Symbol Test, D2 Test, Wiener Determination Machine]) was used to examine 40 patients (43 +/- 10 years) before and immediately after the first fraction (1.2 Gy) of hyperfractionated total body irradiation (TBI) at the University of Heidelberg. The patients received antiemetic premedication. Test results are given as mean percentiles +/- standard deviation, with 50 +/- 34 being normal. Thirty-eight control patients (53 +/- 15 years) were studied to quantify the influence of hospitalization, stress, and repeated testing. Result(s): The patients showed normal baseline test results (IQ = 101 +/- 14, attention = 54 +/- 28) and no decrease in test results after 1.2 Gy TBI. Attention functions improved (66 +/- 25) corresponding to a practice effect of repeated testing that was seen in the control group, although alternate versions of the tests were used (IQ = 104 +/- 10, attention before = 42 +/- 29, attention after = 52 +/- 31).

Patients with resectable rectal cancer were randomised to total mesorectal excision with or without preoperative radiotherapy (PRT). Preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months postoperatively, SD scores were filled out in questionnaires. Possible risk factors for postoperative deterioration of sexual functioning, including patients' demographics, tumour-specific factors and treatment-related variables, were investigated with univariate and multivariable regression analyses. Increase in general SD, erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory problems were reported by 76.4, 79.8 and 72.2 percent of the male patients, respectively. Risk factors were nerve damage, blood loss, anastomotic leakage, PRT and the presence of a stoma. In female patients, increase in general SD, dyspareunia and vaginal dryness were reported by 61.5, 59.1 and 56.6 percent, respectively. This was associated with PRT and the presence of a stoma.

481,"Cumulative radiation dose from medical imaging procedures in patients undergoing resection for lung cancer Background: Radiation dose from diagnostic imaging procedures is not monitored in patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer. Evidence suggests an increased lifetime risk of malignancy of 1.0% per 100 millisieverts (mSv). As such, recommendations are to restrict healthcare and radiation workers to a maximum dose of 50 mSv per year or to 100 mSv over a three-year period. The purpose of this study was to estimate cumulative effective doses of radiation in patients undergoing lung cancer resection and to determine predictors of increased exposure. Method(s): We identified 94 consecutive patients undergoing resection for non-small cell lung cancer. Radiologic procedures performed from one year prior to resection until two years postresection were recorded. Estimates of effective doses (mSv) were obtained from published literature and institutional records. Predictors of dose greater than 50 mSv per year and greater than 100 mSv per three years were examined statistically. Result(s): The majority of patients (median age = 67 years) had stage IA cancer (52%). In the three-year period, patients had 1,958 radiologic studies (20.8/patient) including 398 computed tomographic (CT) scans (4.23/patient) and 211 positron emission tomography (PET) scans (2.24 per patient). The three-year median estimated radiation dose was 84.0 mSv (interquartile range, 44.1 to 123.2 mSv). The highest dose was in the preoperative year. In any one year, 66% of patients received more than 50 mSv, while 19% received over 100 mSv. Over the three-year period, 43.6% of patients exceeded 100 mSv. The majority of the radiation (89.8%) was from CT or PET scans. On multivariate analysis, a history of previous malignancy (odds ratio [OR] 3.8; confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 12.7), postoperative complications (OR 6.16; CI 1.42 to 26.6), and postoperative surveillance with PET-CT (OR 13.2; CI 4.34 to 40.3) predicted exposure greater than 100 mSv over the three-year period. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that lung cancer patients often receive a higher dose of radiation than that considered safe for healthcare and radiation workers. The median cumulative dose reported in this study could potentially increase the individual estimated lifetime cancer risk by as much as 0.8%. Although risk-benefit considerations are clearly different between these groups, strategies should be in place to decrease radiation doses during the preoperative workup and postoperative period. © 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",Excluded,0.88369405
238,"Reconstitution of bone marrow with WKy cells lowers central/peripheral inflammation and blood pressure in the SHR Introduction: Bone marrow (BM) is a crucial meeting point for the sympathetic innervation and hematopoietic/stem cells, including the inflammatory cells (ICs). However, the role of the BM in hypertension is not well defined. We recently demonstrated that a dysfunctional brain-bone marrow communication in rat models of neurogenic hypertension may be associated with impaired BM activity, characterized by elevated levels of ICs in the blood and BM when compared to the normotensive controls. Therefore, we hypothesized that BM of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is pro-inflammatory, and that it contributes to hypertension in this rat model. Method(s): 6-week old female SHR rats underwent BM ablation via a lethal dose of gamma ray irradiation (950 Rads), followed by reconstitution with whole BM mononuclear cells (MNCs, 10E6 cells per rat), derived from the BM of either SHR or WKY male rats (naive SHR n=7; SHR-SHR n=11; SHR-WKY n=9). Following a three-month recovery period, BM reconstitution was confirMed. by Y-chromosome FISH in blood MNCs. Blood pressure was measured by tail-cuff plethysmography. Blood was collected for isolation of MNCs, and quantification of T-cells (CD4/CD8+) was carried out by flow cytometry. Brains were collected and immunohistochemistry was perforMed. using the microglial specific marker Iba1. Microglial activation was quantified by number of microglia per 40,000um2 in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Result(s): We observed no significant difference in the mean arterial pressures (MAP) between the naive SHR (MAP= 134 +/- 5 mmHg) and the SHR-SHR groups (MAP = 137 +/- 5 mmHg). However, the SHR-WKY group showed an approximate 10% decrease in MAP, to 119 +/- 4 mmHg (p<0.05). This was accompanied by a 30% decrease in the circulating T-cell levels, and a 20% decrease in activated microglial cells in the PVN of the SHR-WKY when compared to the SHR-SHR group (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): These data suggest that the pro-inflammatory properties of the SHR BM contribute to hypertension by increasing both the peripheral and central inflammatory status in the SHR. These observations support the role of the BM in hypertension, especially in affecting the inflammatory status, which is a hallmark of hypertension in the SHR.",Excluded,0.8807257

In the context of the sterile insect technique (SIT), the sterilization of the male mosquitoes before their release can be achieved by gamma-ray irradiation. As gamma-ray irradiators are becoming increasingly problematic to purchase and transport, the suitability of an X-ray irradiator as an alternative for the sterilization of Ae. albopictus males was studied. The sterilization of up to 200,000 pupae at one time can be achieved with relative ease, and the sterility results obtained were comparable with those achieved by gamma irradiation, where 99% sterility is induced with a dose of 40 Gy. A significant reduction of longevity was observed in the latter stages of the males' life after irradiation treatments, especially at doses > 40 Gy, which is consistent with the negative effects on longevity induced by similar radiation doses using gamma rays. Females irradiated at 40 Gy were not only 100% sterile, but also failed to oviposit entirely, i.e., all of the females laid 0 eggs. Overall, it was found that the X-ray irradiator is generally suitable for the sterilization process for sterile insect technique programs, as it showed a high processing capacity, practicality, high effectiveness, and reproducibility.",Excluded,0.8767509

The results suggest that either an emigrant wave, or waves, of modern humans emerged from Africa and with time segregated into at least three groups: Australian aborigines, Europeans, and Southeast Asians, or less likely due to genetic and archaeologic observations, a southern Asia origin of all modem humans from an emigrant African hominid.

1136,"Cerebellar modulation of feeding-related neurons in rat dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus Cerebellum has newly been implicated in many more nonsomatic functions other than motor control. Previous studies indicate that the cerebellum is involved in feeding regulation and that the gastric vagal nerves transmit short-term meal-related visceral signals, including cholecystokinin (CCK), into the hypothalamus. Recently, the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMN) has been thought to play an important role in feeding control. Here we investigate whether the inputs from cerebellar interpositus nucleus (IN) can reach and converge onto single DMN neurons with some feeding-related visceral signals, including gastric vagal inputs, CCK, and blood glucose, whose concentration is closely linked to food intake. Among the 259 DMN neurons recorded, 120 (46.3%) and 169 (65.3%) responded to the cerebellar IN and gastric vagal stimulations, respectively. Within the 120 DMN neurons responsive to the cerebellar IN stimulation, 98 (81.7%) also responded to the gastric vagal stimulus, and a summation of the responses was observed further (n = 20), suggesting a convergence and interaction of cerebellar and gastric vagal inputs on the cells. Moreover, among the 98 cells receiving convergent inputs from cerebellar IN and gastric vagal nerves, 69 (70.4%) were identified to be glycemia sensitive, and 22 (68.8%) of the 32 tested neurons were also sensitive to systemic CCK. These results demonstrate that the DMN integrates somatic information forwarded by the cerebellar IN and visceral signals related to food intake, including gastric vagal, CCK and glycemia, and electrophysiologically reveal a novel cerebellohypothalamic IN-DMN pathway through which the cerebellum may actively participate in short-term feeding regulation.",Excluded,0.84592223

The radiobiological response of the mammary glands renders it possible to prevent hormone induced gynecomastia by means of radiotherapy. On this indication, 121 patients treated with female sex hormones between 1961 and 1972 for carcinoma of the prostate were subjected to irradiation of both mammary glands. On 4 successive days, daily doses of 300 r surface dose were administered to each mammary gland, corresponding to a focal dose of 840 r at 3 cm tissue depth. The parameters were: roentgen radiation, 150 kV, 20 mA, 0.5 mm Cu, focus skin distance 40 cm, field size 6 x 6 m. 84 patients could be followed up more than 6 mth after the treatment. In 67 cases (79.8%), development of gynecomastia was completely suppressed, while in 16 cases, a slight degree of gynecomastia had occurred in spite of the irradiation. In one case, the gynecomastia that had already been completely developed at the time of the radiotherapy, had remained uninfluenced apart from a mitigation of the sensation of tension. In 6 of the patients who were free from gynecomastia (8.9%) the hormone treatment had been started prior to the radiotherapy. This proportion was considerably larger among the patients with mild gynecomastia, viz. 75% (12 cases). The lesser effect of the radiotherapy is considered to be correlated with the duration and dosage of the hormone treatment started prior to the radiotherapy, and may also be correlated with the duration of the interval between the end of the hormone treatment and the start of the irradiation.",Excluded,0.84178156
551,"Mortality Analysis of the Life Span Study (LSS) Cohort Taking into Account Multiple Causes of Death Indicated in Death Certificates Mortality analyses have been performed using underlying causes of death as reported on death certificates; these are uniquely determined for a deceased person according to the World Health Organization coding system. Comorbidities, the disease conditions other than the underlying cause of death from death certificates recording multiple causes of death, have rarely been explored in Life Span Study subjects. The purpose of this study was to clarify associations between atomic bomb radiation exposure and mortality from combinations of the underlying cause of death and comorbidities. The focused follow-up period was 1977-2003, prior to which death certificate accuracy was unreliable. The study cohort was comprised of 10,017 people for whom the category ""all circulatory disease"" was listed as the underlying cause of death, of which heart disease (rheumatic, hypertensive and ischemic heart disease) and stroke were major subtypes. Comorbidities considered were pneumonia, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer and the major circulatory disease subtypes listed above. Poisson regression models were used for analyses. Excess relative risks (ERRs) for mortality at 1 Gy were significantly increased when cancer was comorbid with all circulatory disease, heart disease, ischemic heart disease or stroke, ranging from 0.61 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.13, 1.41; N = 177 for all circulatory diseases to 1.60 (CI: 0.07, 4.86; N = 42) for ischemic heart disease. Among the other comorbidities, only diabetes comorbid with heart disease had a significant radiation dose response (ERR at 1 Gy of 0.62, CI: 0.10, 1.46; N = 128). It remains uncertain if the high ERRs with comorbid cancers were anomalous due to the small number of cases or some dissimilarity in statistical methodologies, or if this might suggest some pathogenetic basis for increased fatality. For this reason, further investigation is required.Copyright © 2017 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.8400983
411,"Lhermitte's sign following head and neck radiotherapy Lhermitte's sign is an uncommon sequel of radiotherapy to the cervical spinal cord. Although the exact mechanism underlying its occurrence remains unclear; it is felt to be the result of a temporary interference with the turnover and synthesis of myelin, leading to focal demyelination. We have undertaken a detailed analysis of the radiation delivered to four patients who developed the sign after irradiation for malignancies of the head and neck. Our data support the view that radiation dose is crucial to its development, but calculations using the linear-quadratic radiobiological model raise interesting questions regarding the dose-response relationship. In particular, we find that calculations of biologically effective doses are predictive of a late rather than an early normal tissue response. The onset of symptoms after irradiation was apparent in all four patients within 4 months, with resolution in all being complete within a further 6 months: The recognition of this benign transient form of radiation-induced paraesthesia and its differentiation from the later onset, progressive and unremitting symptoms associated with radiation myelopathy is essential in reassuring patients undergoing head and neck irradiation.",Excluded,0.83668965

Late results of a pilot study BACKGROUND/AIMS: It has recently been proven that postoperative radiotherapy combined with fluorouracil showed an increase of survival and local control in patients with rectal cancer. However, hematological and intestinal toxicity also increased. Experimental and clinical studies showed an increased radiation effect with an acceptable toxicity by delivering drug via a continuous intravenous infusion., METHODOLOGY: From 1988 to 1998, 80 patients radically operated on for stages B2-C rectal cancer were irradiated with 3 fractions of 100 cGy per day to a total dose of 5,600 cGy. 34 out of these 80 patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy alone and 46 received radiotherapy combined with concomitant protracted infusion of fluorouracil at doses of 250 mg/m2 per day., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 54 months, the 5-year overall and disease-free survival were 59% and 54%, respectively, in the combined modality group, as compared to 42% and 34%, respectively, in the radiation alone group. The differences were not significant, but the incidence of local relapse and patients' survival showed a better trend for combined approach., CONCLUSIONS: The data from international literature are in favor of a combined approach, both in preoperative and postoperative treatment of advanced rectal cancer.

We quantitatively assessed the gustatory function of patients with head and neck cancers who underwent radiotherapy using recently developed standardised tools for measuring taste. Method(s): Twenty patients undergoing head and neck irradiation responded to a specific questionnaire and were assessed by olfactory and gustatory function tests. To assess changes over time, testing was performed before, immediately after, and at 2- and 4-week intervals following the start of radiotherapy. Concurrently, patients were evaluated for xerostomia from radiotherapy. Result(s): A decrease in the taste recognition threshold was observed in the second week after the beginning of radiotherapy. The taste detection threshold improved within the 14th-18th week. Most affected patients demonstrated that their gustatory function primarily decreased independent of the olfactory function. Disturbances in taste were exponentially worsened beyond an accumulated dose of 30 Gy and involved all tastants. According to a multivariate analysis, radiation-induced taste impairment was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia. However, there was an association between the dose of irradiation and the severity of taste disturbance. Conclusion(s): In this preliminary study, we found that the taste function was worse 2 weeks after the start of radiotherapy and returned to pretreatment levels within 4.5 months.

Taste dysfunction after radiotherapy was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia, whereas only the dose of irradiation was associated with the severity of taste dysfunction.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded,0.8320201
626,"Sun exposure and pterygium of the eye: a dose-response curve PURPOSE: To present a quantitative analysis of pterygium and ocular sun exposure, a dose-response curve, and a discussion of the health-promotion implications of the findings., METHODS: A hospital-based, case-control study was conducted in Perth, Western Australia. Case subjects had surgical removal of a pterygium; control subjects had an ear, nose, or throat procedure. A lifetime history of residence, sun exposure patterns, and use of hats, spectacles, and sunglasses was obtained at interview. Measures of potential sun exposure included latitude, daily sunshine hours, and daily global solar radiant energy. The most complex estimate of actual sun exposure was the daily ocular solar radiation dose, calculated from climatic data, time spent outdoors not under shade, and the use of hats and spectacles., RESULTS: There were strong positive associations between pterygium and measures of potential and actual sun exposure. Associations were as strong for whole-life measures as for those in any specific age range. Pterygium odds ratios increased with exposure level; the odds ratio was 4.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 10.9) for the highest quarter of the daily sun exposure. The strongest associations were seen for the estimated daily ocular solar radiation dose, with an odds ratio of 6.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 19.7) for the highest quarter of exposure., CONCLUSIONS: Pterygium is strongly related to ocular sun exposure, with little evidence that exposure during any particular period of life is more important than in other periods; the implication for prevention of pterygium is that ocular protection is beneficial at all ages.",Excluded,0.83187324
64,"Assessment of effect of partial sterility on mating performance in sweetpotato weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) The sterile insect technique (SIT) is widely used to suppress or eradicate target pest insect populations. Although the effectiveness of SIT depends on the ability of released sterile males to mate with and inseminate wild females, the use of gamma radiation to induce sterility negatively impacts reproductive cells as well as somatic cells. Consequently, sterilization by irradiation drastically diminishes mating performance over time. In the current study, we evaluated the effect of irradiation dose intensity on fertility, mating propensity, and mating competitiveness in sweetpotato weevil, Cylas formicarius elegantulus (Summers) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), for 16 d after irradiation. Although the mating propensity of males irradiated with 200 Gy, the dose currently used to induce complete sterility of C. f. elegantulus in the SIT program in Okinawa Prefecture, was equal to that of nonirradiated weevils for the first 6 d, the mating propensity of males irradiated with doses between of 75 and 150 Gy was maintained for the first 12 d. The potential fertilization ability of weevils was highly depressed compared with the control weevils, even in those treated with 75 Gy. Mating performance was severely compromised in weevils that were irradiated with a dose of 100 Gy or more. These results demonstrate that partial sterilization can be highly advantageous in eradication programs for the sweetpotato weevil. We discuss the advantages of the application of partial irradiation in insect eradication programs.",Excluded,0.82356876
951,"Ultraviolet B enhances DNA hypomethylation of CD4+ T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus via inhibiting DNMT1 catalytic activity Background: CD4+ T cells DNA hypomethylation is involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Recent studies showed that ultraviolet B (UVB, 290-320. nm) might induce the exacerbation of SLE by decreasing the DNA methylation level. However, the role of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in the UVB-induced CD4+ T cells DNA hypomethylation remains unclear. Objective(s): To elucidate the role of DNMT1 in lupus CD4+ T cells global DNA hypomethylation enhanced by UVB. Method(s): 35 SLE patients and 15 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. CD4+ T cells from SLE patients and healthy controls exposed to different dosages of UVB were analyzed. The global DNA methylation measurement, real-time PCR, Western blotting and DNMT1 catalytic activity detection were employed. Result(s): The level of global DNA methylation and DNMT1 mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients were significantly lower than those from the control group. DNA methylation was decreased after UVB exposure in a dosage-dependent manner in SLE patients, but not in the control group. DNMT1 mRNA and protein expression level were not affected by UVB exposure in both SLE patients and healthy controls. DNMT1 catalytic activity was significantly decreased in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients after UVB exposure in a dosage-dependent manner. DNMT1 catalytic activity was lower and more sensitive to UVB exposure in CD4+ T cells from active SLE patients that from stable ones. Conclusion(s): UVB enhanced DNA hypomethylation of CD4+ T cells in SLE via inhibiting DNMT1 catalytic activity in a dosage-dependent manner. © 2013 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.",Excluded,0.8223478
844,"Gut microbial dysbiosis is associated with development and progression of radiation enteritis during pelvic radiotherapy Radiation enteritis (RE) is the most common complication of radiotherapy for pelvic irradiation receivers. Herein we investigated the alterations in gut microbial profiles and their association with enteritis in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. Faecal samples were collected from 18 cervical cancer patients during radiotherapy. Microbiota profiles were characterized based on 16S rRNA sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Epithelial inflammatory response was evaluated using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures. Dysbiosis was observed among patients with RE, which was characterized by significantly reduced alpha-diversity but increased beta-diversity, relative higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria and lower abundance of Bacteroides. Coprococcus was clearly enriched prior to radiotherapy in patients who later developed RE. Metastat analysis further revealed unique grade-related microbial features, such as more abundant Virgibacillus and Alcanivorax in patients with mild enteritis. Additionally, using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures, RE patient-derived microbiota induced epithelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction, enhanced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta expression compared with control microbiota. Taken together, we define the overall picture of gut microbiota in patients with RE. Our results suggest that dysbiosis of gut microbiota may contribute to development and progression of RE. Gut microbiota can offer a set of biomarkers for prediction, disease activity evaluation and treatment selection in RE. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

233,"Ionizing radiation and genetic risks. VI. Chronic multifactorial diseases: a review of epidemiological and genetical aspects of coronary heart disease, essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus This paper provides a broad overview of the epidemiological and genetical aspects of common multifactorial diseases in man with focus on three well-studied ones, namely, coronary heart disease (CHD), essential hypertension (EHYT) and diabetes mellitus (DM). In contrast to mendelian diseases, for which a mutant gene either in the heterozygous or homozygous condition is generally sufficient to cause disease, for most multifactorial diseases, the concepts of genetic susceptibility' and risk factors' are more appropriate. For these diseases, genetic susceptibility is heterogeneous. The well-studied diseases such as CHD permit one to conceptualize the complex relationships between genotype and phenotype for chronic multifactorial diseases in general, namely that allelic variations in genes, through their products interacting with environmental factors, contribute to the quantitative variability of biological risk factor traits and thus ultimately to disease outcome. Two types of such allelic variations can be distinguished, namely those in genes whose mutant alleles have (i) small to moderate effects on the risk factor trait, are common in the population (polymorphic alleles) and therefore contribute substantially to the variability of biological risk factor traits and (ii) profound effects, are rare in the population and therefore contribute far less to the variability of biological risk factor traits. For all the three diseases considered in this review, a positive family history is a strong risk factor. CHD is one of the major contributors to mortality in most industrialized countries. Evidence from epidemiological studies, clinical correlations, genetic hyperlipidaemias etc., indicate that lipids play a key role in the pathogenesis of CHD. The known lipid-related risk factors include: high levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol, low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, high apoB levels (the major protein fraction of the low density lipoprotein particles) and elevated levels of Lp(a) lipoprotein. Among the risk factors which are not related to lipids are: high levels of homocysteine, low activity of paraoxonase and possibly also elevated plasma fibrinogen levels. In addition to the above, hypertension, diabetes and obesity (which themselves have genetic determinants) are important risk factors for CHD. Among the environmental risk factors are: high dietary fat intake, smoking, stress, lack of exercise etc. About 60% of the variability of the plasma cholesterol is genetic in origin. While a few genes have been identified whose mutant alleles have large effects on this trait (e.g., LDLR, familial defective apoB-100), variability in cholesterol levels among individuals in most families is influenced by allelic variation in many genes (polymorphisms) as well as environmental exposures. A proportion of this variation can be accounted for by two alleles of the apoE locus that increase (&epsi;4) and decrease (&epsi;2) cholesterol levels, respectively. A polymorphism at the apoB gene (XbaI) also has similar effects, but is probably not mediated through lipids. High density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are genetically influenced and are related to apoA1 and hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene functions. Mutations in the apoA1 gene are rare and there are data which suggest a role of allelic variation at or linked LIPC gene in high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Polymorphism at the apoA1--C3 loci is often associated with hypertriglyceridemia. The apo(a) gene which codes for Lp(a) is highly polymorphic, each allele determining a specific number of multiple tandem repeats of a unique coding sequence known as Kringle 4. The size of the gene correlates with the size of the Lp(a) protein. The smaller the size of the Lp(a) protein, the higher are the Lp(a) levels. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",Excluded,0.7990112
926,"Radiation dose considerations in the palliative treatment of locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas Treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer with high-dose radiotherapy has not been curative, and can be difficult to tolerate. We decided to compare retrospectively the outcomes of patients treated concurrently with 5-fluorouracil and either 30 Gy or more than 30 Gy of radiation. From December 1993 through May 2001, 107 patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas had been treated with palliative chemoradiation. Eighty-six patients had received a prescribed dose of 30 Gy and 50.4 Gy had been prescribed in 18 patients. Two of these patients were unable to complete the full dose of radiotherapy due to toxicity, and 3 received intraoperative radiotherapy boost (20 Gy). Three additional patients received a prescribed dose of 33 Gy, 36 Gy, and 52.2 Gy, respectively. These patients were grouped together (n = 21, median 50.4 Gy). All patients had received concurrent protracted venous infusions of 5-fluorouracil (300 mg/m Monday through Friday). The median survival time was not affected significantly by a higher radiotherapy dose (8 months for the 30 Gy group versus 9 months for the group receiving higher doses; P = 0.64). The 6-month actuarial progression rates were 45% versus 50% (P = 0.90) for local disease progression, and 54% versus 50% (P = 0.94) for distant metastasis for the 30 Gy and the higher dose groups, respectively. Ten of the 86 patients (12%) who had received 30 Gy were hospitalized for treatment-related gastrointestinal toxicity (grade 3) versus 6 of the 21 (29%) patients given higher doses (P = 0.05). Compared with higher doses given over 5 to 6 weeks, chemoradiation (30 Gy in 10 fractions in 2 weeks with concurrent infusional 5-FU) results in a similar median survival, and local disease progression rates in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer apparently do not substantially improve local disease control or median survival time. Because higher doses of radiotherapy can lead to increased acute treatment-related morbidity, we recommend using 30 Gy in 10 fractions unless the patient is part of a prospective study evaluating novel biologic or cytotoxic radiosensitizers.",Excluded,0.7842646
922,"Comparison of the micronucleus and chromosome aberration techniques for the documentation of cytogenetic damage in radiochemotherapy-treated patients with rectal cancer PURPOSE: The goal of the interdisciplinary Clinical Research Unit KFO179 (Biological Basis of Individual Tumor Response in Patients with Rectal Cancer) is to develop an individual Response and Toxicity Score for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. The aim of the present study was to find a reliable and sensitive method with easy scoring criteria and high numbers of cell counts in a short period of time in order to analyze DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Thus, the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay and the chromosome aberration technique (CAT) were tested., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from 22 patients with rectal cancer before (0 Gy), during (21.6 Gy), and after (50.4 Gy) radiochemotherapy were stimulated in vitro by phytohemagglutinin (PHA); the cultures were then processed for the CBMN assay and the CAT to compare the two methods., RESULTS: A significant increase of chromosomal damage was observed in the course of radiochemotherapy parallel to increasing radiation doses, but independent of the chemotherapy applied. The equivalence of both methods was shown by Westlake's equivalence test., CONCLUSION: The results show that the CBMN assay and the CAT are equivalent. For further investigations, we prefer the CBMN assay, because it is simpler through easy scoring criteria, allows high numbers of cell counts in less time, is reliable, sensitive, and has higher statistical power. In the future, we plan to integrate cytogenetic damage during radiochemotherapy into the planned Response and Toxicity Score within our interdisciplinary Clinical Research Unit.",Excluded,0.7729164
1002,"Impact of 2.45 GHz Microwave Irradiation on the Fruit Fly, Drosophila melanogaster The physiological and behavioral influences of 2.45 GHz microwaves on Drosophila melanogaster were examined. Standing waves transitioned into heat energy effectively when passing through the insect body. On the contrary, travelling waves did not transit into heat energy in the insect body. This indicated that there was no concern regarding the thermal effects of microwave irradiation for levels of daily usage. However, we detected genotoxicity and behavioral alterations associated with travelling wave irradiation, which can be attributed to the non-thermal effects of the waves. Electron spin resonance (ESR) revealed that fruit flies possessed paramagnetic substances in the body such as Fe3+, Cu2+, Mn2+, and organic radicals. The temperature dependent intensities of these paramagnetic substances indicated that females possessed more of the components susceptible to electromagnetic waves than males, and the behavioral tests supported the differences between the sexes.",Excluded,0.7714596

439,"Comparative toxicity of synchrotron and conventional radiation therapy based on total and partial body irradiation in a murine model Synchrotron radiation can facilitate novel radiation therapy modalities such as microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) and high dose-rate synchrotron broad-beam radiation therapy (SBBR). Both of these modalities have unique physical properties that could be exploited for an improved therapeutic effect. While pre-clinical studies report promising normal tissue sparing phenomena, systematic toxicity data are still required. Our objective was to characterise the toxicity of SBBR and MRT and to calculate equivalent doses of conventional radiation therapy (CRT). A dose-escalation study was performed on C57BLJ/6 mice using total body and partial body irradiations. Dose-response curves and TD50 values were subsequently calculated using PROBIT analysis. For SBBR at dose-rates of 37 to 41 Gy/s, we found no evidence of a normal tissue sparing effect relative to CRT. Our findings also show that the MRT valley dose, rather than the peak dose, best correlates with CRT doses for acute toxicity. Importantly, longer-term weight tracking of irradiated animals revealed more pronounced growth impairment following MRT compared to both SBBR and CRT. Overall, this study provides the first in vivo dose-equivalence data between MRT, SBBR and CRT and presents systematic toxicity data for a range of organs that can be used as a reference point for future pre-clinical work.",Excluded,0.7697052

However, for isolated lung metastasis (ILM) of thoracic malignances after pulmonary lobectomy, reported outcomes of SBRT have been limited. This study evaluates the role of SBRT in the treatment of such patients. Method(s): A retrospective search of the SBRT database was conducted in three hospitals. The parameters analyzed in the treated patients were local control, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the treatment-related side-effects. Result(s): In total, 23 patients with single ILM after pulmonary lobectomy treated with SBRT were identified and the median follow-up time was 14 months (range: 6.0-47.0 months). Local recurrences were observed in two patients during follow-up and the 1-year local control rate was 91.3%. Median PFS and OS for the studied cohort were 10.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1-14.9 months] and 21.0 months (95% CI 11.4-30.6 months), respectively. Acute radiation pneumonitis (RP) of grade 2 or worse was observed in five (21.7%) and three (13.0%) patients, respectively. Other treatment-related toxicities included chest wall pain in one patient (4.3%) and acute esophagitis in two patients (8.7%). By Pearson correlation analysis, the planning target volume (PTV) volume and the volume of the ipsilateral lung exposed to a minimum dose of 5 Gy (IpV5) were significantly related to the acute RP of grade 2 or worse in present study (p < 0.05). The optimal thresholds of the PTV and IpV5 to predict RP of acute grade 2 or worse RP were 59 cm3 and 51% respectively, according to the receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis, with sensitivity/specificity of 75.0%/80.0% and 62.5%/80.0%. Conclusion(s): SBRT for post-lobectomy ILM was effective and well tolerated. The major reason for disease progression was distant failure but not local recurrence. The PTV and IpV5 are potential predictors of acute RP of grade 2 or higher and should be considered in treatment planning for such patients.Copyright © 2014 Xiong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded,0.76351637

Patients and Methods: In 35 consecutively registered patients, irradiated because of SVCS, different primary carcinomas (lung, breast, head-and-neck, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) were ascertained. Distant metastases had already been diagnosed in 33 patients. Chemotherapy had previously been given in seven patients. Result(s): In 30 patients, radiotherapy obtained a reduction of symptoms within 5-9 days. However, in seven patients, radiotherapy had to be stopped early because of local progress and tumor induced complications. Local recurrences were observed in six patients.

For each municipality we estimated the median radon concentration and the relative risk (RR) for esophageal cancer mortality for males and females. The relative risk was calculated using a Bayesian approach. Homes with data on radon concentration were selected through stratified random sampling. To be included, each municipality had to have at least five radon measurements.

To identify potential biomarkers, a preclinical trial was performed on ten different human squamous cell carcinoma xenografts of the head and neck (HNSCC) studying in vivo and ex vivo the effect of fractionated irradiation and EGFR inhibition. Local tumour control and tumour growth delay were correlated with potential biomarkers, e.g. EGFR gene amplification and radioresponse-associated gene expression profiles. Material and methods Local tumour control 120 days after end of irradiation was determined for fractionated radiotherapy alone (30 f, 6 weeks) or after simultaneous EGFR-inhibition with cetuximab. The EGFR gene amplification status was determined using FISH. Gene expression analyses were performed using an in-house gene panel. Results Six out of 10 investigated tumour models showed a significant increase in local tumour control for the combined treatment of cetuximab and fractionated radiotherapy compared to irradiation alone. For 3 of the 6 responding tumour models, an amplification of the EGFR gene could be demonstrated. Gene expression profiling of untreated tumours revealed significant differences between amplified and non-amplified tumours as well as between responder and non-responder tumours to combined radiotherapy and cetuximab. Conclusion The EGFR amplification status, in combination with gene expression profiling, may serve as a predictive biomarker for personalized interventional strategies regarding combined treatment of cetuximab and fractionated radiotherapy and should, as a next step, be clinically validated.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.7454281

61,"Evaluation of light-emitting diode (LED-835 NM) application over human gingival fibroblast: An in vitro study Since the laser and photomodulation were discovered over 50 years, they have been used for many applications in medicine and in dentistry also. In particular, light-emitting diodes therapy (LT) achieved a great success in medical treatment and photo-therapy. In the decades, LT has been used for several therapeutic purposes. Many beneficial effects have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, including antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor, cell differentiation, immune potentiating and tissue repair activities. Beneficial effects of LT have also been observed in clinical settings. Although there are lots of cell culture studies in low-level laser therapy, there are only a few cell culture studies in LT that have similar characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LT on primary human gingival fibroblast cells (HGF) on elastin (ELN) gene activation using Real Time PCR. ELN gene activation is directly connected with elastin protein production and HGF functionality. Human gingival tissue biopsies were obtained from three healthy patients during tooth extraction. The gingival specimens were fragmented with a scalpel and transferred in culture dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FBS) and antibiotics, i.e. penicillin 100U/ml and streptomycin 100mug/ml. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37C. The medium was changed the next day and twice a week. After 15 days, the samples of gingival tissue were removed from the culture dishes. Cells were harvested after an additional 24 h incubation. Human gingival fibroblasts at the second passage were seeded on multiple 6-well plates. The cells stimulation was performed with a light-emitting diodes (LEDs) medical device type E-Light. The LED irradiation seems to be directly correlated with the elastin (ELN) gene activation. Interestingly, ELN gene expression in the cultured human gingival fibroblasts seems to be inversely related to the patients' age; in fact, its expression tends to decrease with aging. In summary, the result of the present study shows that LED irradiation promoted ELN gene expression more in elderly than in younger adults.Copyright © by BIOLIFE, s.a.s.",Excluded,0.7396631

Crossover suppression by tandem duplication may be attributed to intrastrand foldbacks of the type regularly seen in somatic polytene chromosomes. As a consequence, linkage disequilibrium between duplicated elements and normal chromosomes should be more profound than has been supposed.

A significant improvement in tumor cell damage (double strand DNA breaks), growth suppression, and overall survival under clinical radiation therapy conditions were observed in a human pancreatic xenograft model. For the first time, safe systemic administration and systematic renal clearance was demonstrated in both tested species. These findings strongly support the translational potential of SiGdNP for MR-guided radiation therapy in cancer treatment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.7340571
90,"Reduction of gastrointestinal risks in parallelism to reduced chronic pain medication after repeated random mine inhalation therapy in ankylosing spondylitis - A 12-year follow-up of a controlled prospective study Aim of this controlled prospective study was to find out the long time effect of repeated radon mine inhalation therapy on patients with ankylosing spondylitis concerning their consumption of NSAIDS and their complications of the gastrointestinuum. 100 patients with definite ankylosing spondylitis and with repeated rehabilitation-therapy within 12 years were asked about their consumption of NSAIDS (days per week) and about occurring of in patient treatment because of severe complications of the gastrointestinuum. Additionally they reported their examinations of the gastrointestinuum and their use of gastroprotective medication (PPI). Several sociodemographic parameters and some more medical parameters were observed. Treatment group (n = 49) and control group (n = 51) had about 6 in-patient rehabilitation treatments within the period of 12 years, in the treatment group additionally radon mine inhalation therapy was given. Compared to the beginning of the study consumption of NSAIDS after 12 years was only reduced in the treatment group (p < 0,05). Severe complications of the gastrointestinuum followed by in patient treatment were reported by 18 % of the control group and 5% of the treatment group. Bleeding complications only occurred in the control group. So regularly repeated radon mine inhalation therapy seems to lead to a reduced consumption of NSAIDS and a reduced rate of side effect complications for patients with ankylosing spondylitis.",Excluded,0.73300046
756,"Adjuvant radiotherapy for margin-positive high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity Purpose: Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) has been shown to improve local control in patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities (STS). The specific impact of adjuvant radiation on patients with positive margins, however, has not been clearly defined. The purpose of this study was to determine if adjuvant RT improves local control in patients with high-grade STS who had positive margins of resection. Methods and Materials: Between 8/82 and 2/97, 110 adult patients with primary high-grade STS of an extremity underwent limb sparing surgery and were found to have a histologically positive microscopic surgical margin. Ninety-one (83%) received RT and 19 (17%) had no RT. The two groups were balanced with regard to size, site, location, and tumor depth. Adjuvant RT was delivered with brachytherapy (BRT) alone in 34 patients, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) alone in 33 patients, or BRT+EBRT in 24 patients. The BRT dose was 45 Gy when used alone and 15-20 Gy when used as a boost. The EBRT dose was 60-70 Gy when used alone and 45-50 Gy when given with BRT. The median follow-up time was 41 months (range, 3-186 months). Result(s): The overall 5 year local control rate was 71%. This rate was significantly higher in the RT group compared to the no RT group (74% vs. 56%, respectively) (p = 0.01). On univariate analysis, lower extremity site and proximal location were also found to be predictors of improved local control (p = 0.03 and 0.03, respectively). However, only proximal location and the use of RT retained their significance as predictors of improved local control on multivariate analysis (p = 0.003 and 0.01, respectively). The overall 5-year distant relapse-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 54%, 44%, and 53%, respectively. No statistical differences were found in these survival rates between RT and no RT groups. Conclusion(s): Based on this study, adjuvant radiotherapy seems to improve local control in patients with high-grade STS of the extremity with positive margins. However, local recurrence still occurs in a substantial proportion of patients, mandating further need for improvement. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded,0.73203707
816,"Hormonal suppression restores fertility in irradiated mice from both endogenous and donor-derived stem spermatogonia Irradiation interrupts spermatogenesis and causes prolonged sterility in male mammals. Hormonal suppression treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues has restored spermatogenesis in irradiated rats, but similar attempts were unsuccessful in irradiated mice, monkeys, and humans. In this study, we tested a stronger hormonal suppression regimen (the GnRH antagonist, acyline, and plus flutamide) for efficacy both in restoring endogenous spermatogenesis and in enhancing colonization of transplanted stem spermatogonia in mouse testes irradiated with a total doses between 10.5 and 13.5 Gy. A 4-week hormonal suppression treatment, given immediately after irradiation, increased endogenous spermatogenic recovery 1.5-fold, and 11-week hormonal suppression produced twofold increases compared with sham-treated irradiated controls. Furthermore, 10-week hormonal suppression restored fertility from endogenous surviving spermatogonial stem cells in 90% of 10.5-Gy irradiated mice, whereas only 10% were fertile without hormonal suppression. Four-and 11-week hormonal suppression also enhanced spermatogenic development from transplanted stem spermatogonia in irradiated recipient mice, by 3.1-and 4.8-fold, respectively, compared with those not given hormonal treatment. Moreover, the 10-week hormonal suppression regimen, but not a sham treatment, restored fertility of some 13.5-Gy irradiated recipient mice from donor-derived spermatogonial stem cells. This is the first report of hormonal suppression inducing recovery of endogenous spermatogenesis and fertility in a mouse model treated with anticancer agents. The combination of spermatogonial transplantation with hormonal suppression should be investigated as a treatment to restore fertility in young men after cytotoxic cancer therapy. © The Author 2010.

1026,"Sexual Function, Quality of Life, and Mood After Radiation Therapy in Patients with Anal Cancer PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Definitive chemoradiation (CRT) results in high cure rates of anal cancer, with advanced radiation (RT) techniques improving toxicity. However, there is limited data regarding these patients' sexual function (SF), quality of life (QOL), and mood. We hypothesized that anal cancer treatment would result in detrimental effects on SF, QOL, and mood., MATERIALS/METHODS: We prospectively surveyed patients with anal cancer treated with definitive CRT. We assessed SF for women with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and for men with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). For all patients, we assessed QOL using EORTC QLQ-C30 and CR29 and mood using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). We reported descriptive statistics for SF, QOL, and mood and used univariate analysis to evaluate predictors of SF for women., RESULTS: Of 50 eligible patients, 84% completed the surveys. Median time from RT until survey was 36 months (1-97 months). Women (n = 34) reported poor SF overall (mean FSFI score = 15, scale 2-36, standard deviation (SD) 10.4). Most women reported poor SF related to satisfaction, desire, orgasm, arousal, pain, and lubrication. Men (n = 8) also had poor overall satisfaction (mean IIEF score = 6.1, scale 2-10, SD 3.6). Men reported poor erectile function and lower satisfaction with intercourse. Mean QLQ-C30 QOL score was 86.5 (SD 16.3). Results from EORTC QLQ-CR-20 demonstrated patients experienced poor sexual interest. Per HADS, 2.5% reported depression and 18% anxiety., CONCLUSION: Patients with anal cancer experience sexual dysfunction after RT, with QOL and mood symptoms similar to patients with other cancers. Our data support the need for ongoing efforts to understand and address issues with SF, QOL, and mood following RT for these patients.",Excluded,0.7260509
483,"Clinical protocol: Phase I study to the immunotherapy of metastatic malignant melanoma by a cancer vaccine consisting of autologous cancer cells transfected with the human IL-2 gene The direct modification of tumor cells using cytokine genes as a strategy to enhance host immunity against cancer has been studied extensively in animal models. Results obtained showed that mice injected with IL-2-transfected cancer cells mount a tumor-specific immune response that is sufficient in magnitude to protect the animals against a challenge with a tumorigenic dose of wild-type parental cancer cells. Currently, trials are ongoing to determine the feasibility of such a treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma, colon carcinoma and melanoma. We now propose a cancer vaccine trial for stage IV melanoma patients with no hope for cure by either chemotherapy, surgery or irradiation. The vaccine consists of irradiated, autologous melanoma cells which had been genetically engineered by means of receptor-mediated, adenovirus-augmented gene delivery (transferrinfection) to produce human IL-2. Patients receive repeated injections of two different doses of the vaccine and will be monitored for the occurrence of any adverse reactions to it. In addition, we will determine whether the administration of the vaccine induces and/or enhances tumor-specific host responses at the immunological and/or clinical level.",Excluded,0.7249199
905,"Gamma Knife surgery for parasellar meningiomas: long-term results including complications, predictive factors, and progression-free survival OBJECT: Stereotactic radiosurgery serves as an important primary and adjuvant treatment option for patients with many types of intracranial meningiomas. This is particularly true for patients with parasellar meningiomas. In this study, the authors evaluated the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) used to treat parasellar meningiomas., METHODS: The study is a retrospective review of the outcomes in 138 patients with meningiomas treated at the University of Virginia from 1989 to 2006; all patients had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. There were 31 men and 107 women whose mean age was 54 years (range 19-85 years). Eighty-four patients had previously undergone resection. The mean pre-GKS tumor volume was 7.5 ml (range 0.2-54.8 ml). Clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed, and factors related to favorable outcomes in each case were assessed., RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 84 months (median 75.5 months, range 24-216 months). In 118 patients (86%), the tumor volume was unchanged or had decreased at last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated radiographic progression-free survival at 5 and 10 years to be 95.4% and 69%, respectively. Fourteen patients (10%) developed new cranial nerve palsies following GKS. Factors associated with tumor control included younger age, a higher isodose, and smaller tumor volume. A longer follow-up duration was associated with either a decrease or increase in tumor volume. Fourteen patients (10%) experienced new or worsening cranial nerve deficits after treatment. Factors associated with this occurrence were larger pretreatment tumor volume, lower peripheral radiation dose, lower maximum dose, tumor progression, and longer follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery offers an acceptable rate of tumor control for parasellar meningiomas and accomplishes this with a low incidence of neurological deficits. Radiological control after radiosurgery is more likely in those patients with a smaller tumor volume and a higher prescription dose.",Excluded,0.7230732
180,"Lung exposure from inhalation of radon progeny: Calculated from in vivo measurements of 210Pb in the skull To calculate the radiation dose to the lungs from the inhalation of radon and its short-lived progeny, an accurate estimate of cumulative exposure is necessary. In this preliminary study, the content of 210Pb in the skeleton is used to obtain a measure of integrated exposure to the lungs of people living in homes with above average concentrations of radon. Measurements of skeletal 210Pb made in vivo allow the exposed individuals to become, in effect, their own 'samplers' and 'dosimeters' through the normal physical and physiological processes of inhalation, deposition, and retention. 210Pb measurements have been made on 40 subjects whose homes have above average levels of radon. These data are used to obtain their cumulative lung exposures, defined as RLM (Respiratory Level Months). RLM is calculated from the numbers of atoms of RaA, RaB, and RaC,C' deposited in their respiratory systems over the time periods lived in the surveyed homes. The RLM values obtained are not significantly different than conventional WLM exposures calculated for the same time periods.",Excluded,0.7225413

Median age at RT was 76 years (range 30-92), including 27 patients (41%) aged >= 80 years. Median RT dose was 58.05 Gy (range 37.5-67.5), all delivered in 15 daily fractions. Thirty-two patients received proton RT and 34 patients received photon RT., RESULTS: Median follow-up times from diagnosis and RT start were 21 months and 14 months, respectively. In total, five patients (7.6%) developed local failure. The 2-year outcomes were 84% local control (LC) and 58% OS. Among the 51 patients treated with definitive intent, the 2-year LC rate was 93% and the OS rate was 62%. On multivariate analysis for LC, older age was associated with a lower risk of local failure [hazard ratio (HR) 0.91; p = 0.02], while prior surgery (HR 16.5; p = 0.04) and macrovascular invasion (HR 123.93; p = 0.02) were independently associated with an increased risk of local failure. On multivariate analysis for OS, female sex (HR 0.33; p = 0.001) and prior chemotherapy (HR 0.38; p = 0.003) remained significantly associated with OS. On multivariate analysis for OS, compared with photon RT, there was a trend towards improved survival with proton RT (HR 0.50; p = 0.05). The rate of overall grade 3 + toxicity was 11%. One patient developed radiation-induced liver disease and was treated with corticosteroids., CONCLUSIONS: HF-RT yields high rates of local control and is an effective modality to optimize biliary control for unresectable/locally recurrent ICC.",Excluded,0.719412
1014,"Potential Functional Variants in DNA Repair Genes Are Associated with Efficacy and Toxicity of Radiotherapy in Patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Background. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Radiotherapy, either alone or with chemotherapy, is still the primary treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are variations in how patients with NSCLC respond to radiotherapy and how toxic the therapy is. DNA repair gene polymorphisms are related to cancer development; however, their association with radiotherapy outcomes remains unknown. We hypothesized that gDNA repair gene variation could affect the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Methods. A total of 486 histologically confirmed patients with NSCLC were recruited from the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from July 2015 to September 2019. Eleven potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four DNA repair genes (XRCC1, XRCC2, XPD, and MSH2) were genotyped in these patients. A multiple factor logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between these SNPs and the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy. Results. Three SNPs, rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD), were all significantly associated with the efficacy of radiotherapy. The allele frequencies of the rs25487 CC genotype (OR = 0.457, 95% CI = 0.259-0.804, p=0.006) and the rs3218556 AG or AA genotypes (AG genotype: OR = 0.664, 95% CI = 0.442-0.999, p=0.049; AA genotype: OR = 0.380, 95% CI = 0.181-0.795, p=0.008) were both significantly higher in the response group than in the nonresponse group. For rs13181, the radiotherapy efficacy was associated with the heterozygous genotype GT (OR = 1.663, 95% CI = 1.057-2.614,p=0.027). Statistically significant associations between radiation-induced toxic reactions and rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) were also observed. The rs13181GT genotype was associated with lower toxic reactions than the TT genotype (OR = 1.680, 95% CI = 1.035-2.728,p=0.035). Conclusions. The variants rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) all contribute to the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Our findings may clarify the predictive value of DNA repair genes for prognosis in patients with NSCLC after radiotherapy. Further investigation of more genes and samples should be performed to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2020 Zhiguang Yang and Zhaoyu Liu.",Excluded,0.7147546
183,"Brain and arterial abnormalities following prenatal X-ray irradiation in mice assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and angiography The present study aimed to quantitatively characterize changes in the whole brain and arterial morphology in response to prenatal ionizing irradiation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography (MRA) were used to evaluate brain and arterial abnormalities in 8-week-old male mice prenatally exposed to X-ray radiation at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 Gy on embryonic day (E) 13. Irradiated mice demonstrated decreased brain volume, increased ventricular volume, and arterial malformation. Additionally, MRA signal intensity and arterial thickness in the anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and basilar artery were lower in radiation-exposed mice than in control mice.

995,"Significance of surgical resection for the treatment of multiple brain metastases Background: We investigated the role of surgery in the treatment of multiple brain metastases when performed with radiation therapy. Patients and Methods: One hundred and thirty-eight patients who underwent resection for brain metastases and received 30 Gy or more of adjuvant radiation therapy were entered into this study. Seventy-seven of the 138 patients (56%) had single brain metastases (Single Group), while the remaining 61 patients (44%) had multiple foci (Multiple Group). The 138 patients were divided into four subgroups; patients in Single Group treated with total or subtotal resection (Group A), those in Multiple Group who underwent total or subtotal resection and had remaining tumors smaller than 2 cm (Group B), those in Single Group treated with partial resection (Group C), and the other patients in Multiple Group (Group D). Result(s): The median survival was 8.7 and 9.2 months for the Single Group and the Multiple Group, respectively (not statistically different). The median survival was 9.6, 12.4, 3.7, and 4.5 months for Groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. Survival duration differed significantly between GroupsA/B and Groups C/D (p < 0.05).

Climatological data from 4 weather stations in the area were collected. The association between RRD incidence and solar radiation was investigated., RESULTS: A total of 256 RRD cases were identified. There was a seasonal variation in the incidence of RRD with a maximum number of incident cases observed in June and July and a minimum number of cases observed in January and December. An association was found between RRD incidence and solar radiation both monthly (p = 0.004) and bimonthly (p = 0.057). The right eye was more frequently affected than the left eye (p = 0.035). RD cases other than rhegmatogenous showed neither seasonality nor association with radiation., CONCLUSIONS: Solar radiation may play a role in RRD genesis in our area. Laterality could be related to the amount of radiation reaching each eye. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded,0.7046127
44,"Radiation sensitivity in vitro of primary tumors and metastatic lesions of malignant melanoma The radiation sensitivity of cells isolated directly from surgical specimens of the primary tumor and one to three distant metastases in ten different melanoma patients was measured in vitro using the Courtenay soft agar colony assay. Dose-response curves were fitted to the cell survival data by the method of least squares using the multitarget-single hit and the linear-quadratic models. The ten patients could be divided into three distinct groups. Group I consisted of four patients with radioresistant primary tumors (D0s from 1.38 +/- 0.06 Gy to 1.69 +/- 0.08 Gy). The radiation sensitivity of the metastases (D0s from 1.33 +/- 0.10 Gy to 1.73 +/- 0.06 Gy) was not significantly different from that of the primary tumor in this group; i.e., no heterogeneity was observed. Group II consisted of three patients with radiosensitive primary tumors (D0s from 0.84 +/- 0.06 Gy to 0.91 +/- 0.05 Gy). Heterogeneity was not observed in this group either; i.e., all metastases were radiosensitive (D0s from 0.85 +/- 0.05 Gy to 1.00 +/- 0.06 Gy). Group III consisted of three patients with a heterogeneous disease. The primary tumor of all patients in this group was radiosensitive (D0s from 0.85 +/- 0.05 Gy to 1.03 +/- 0.05 Gy). The most radioresistant metastasis in each patient was significantly (P much less than 0.05) more resistant (D0s from 1.46 +/- 0.06 Gy to 1.56 +/- 0.07 Gy) than the primary tumor. None of the metastases were significantly more radiosensitive than the primary tumor in any patient. These observations suggest that the progression of tumors to increased levels of malignancy includes the increased ability to become radioresistant, and it may be speculated that similar genomic alterations are responsible for the development of the metastatic and the radioresistant tumor cell phenotype. If so, this may have severe implications for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma with low linear energy transfer ionizing radiation as well as for the development of predictive assays for tumor treatment sensitivity.",Excluded,0.70327294

Blood flow parameters 1 cm below the bifurcation of the common carotid artery (mean velocity time averaged, lumen diameter, resistivity index-RI) as well as perivascular reaction, were recorded on Color Doppler Imaging video tapes in a series of five consecutive examinations up to six months postirradiation. There were no statistically significant changes shown between the initial and follow-up examinations for any of the parameters investigated. There was no difference in blood flow between the ipsilateral (operated-irradiated) and contralateral side of the neck. Results did not seem to correlate with known vascular disease risk factors such as sex, arterial pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking and diabetes. After the effect of age was controlled, flow measurements remained statistically stable. Radiation dosage did not appear to influence carotid flow parameters. Perivascular reaction had the highest peak immediately postirradiation but regressed with time. This study suggests that therapeutic radiation of the neck at this dose level may not have important effects on the maxillofacial region blood supply for approximately eight months postoperatively; however, these patients should be closely evaluated for symptoms or signs of carotid artery lesions on a long-term basis.",Excluded,0.6998624
575,"Acute phase response before treatment predicts radiation esophagitis in non-small cell lung cancer BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation esophagitis (RE) represents an inflammatory reaction to radiation therapy (RT). We hypothesized that aspects of the physiologic acute phase response (APR) predicts RE., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 285 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive radiation. The primary analysis was the association of pretreatment lab values reflective of the APR with symptomatic (grade 2) RE. Univariate and multivariate odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to test associations of clinical and pretreatment lab values with RE. Optimal cutpoints and multivariable risk stratification groupings were determined via recursive partitioning analysis., RESULTS: Pretreatment platelet counts were higher and hemoglobin levels lower in patients who developed RE (P<0.05). Based on these two pre-treatment risk factors, an APR score was defined as 0 (no risk factors), 1 (either risk factor), or 2 (both risk factors). APR score was significantly associated with RE in both univariate (OR = 2.3 for each point, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.4, P = 0.001) and multivariate (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4, P = 0.002) analyses., CONCLUSIONS: The APR score may represent a novel metric to predict RE. However, pending validation in an independent dataset, caution is advised when interpreting these results given their retrospective and thus exploratory nature. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

18,"Reliability and validity of a telephone questionnaire for estimating lifetime personal sun exposure in epidemiologic studies Our Australia-wide case-control study of ocular melanoma diagnosed in 1996 to 1997 needed a short telephone interview on sun exposure. We constructed one by examining data from 700 controls ages 40 to 64 years in the Geraldton Skin Cancer Survey in 1988; they had answered a ""whole-of-life"" questionnaire in a face-to-face interview. Sun exposure in their first 4 decade years of age best predicted their lifetime annual average sun exposure, so the shortened questionnaire asked about sun exposure in these 4 decade years only. Retesting 60 participants 1 year later with the whole-of-life questionnaire gave an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.78) for ranked total sun exposure between the two interviews; the intraclass correlation coefficient was higher in men (0.73) than in women (0.54). Correlations were also high between parallel measurements of sun exposure on working days in the decade years and in outdoor occupations throughout life in the telephone interview of the ocular melanoma study (Spearman's R = 0.75) and in another study of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (R = 0.71). Agreement between simultaneous parallel measures of total exposure (nonworking + working day and recreational + occupational exposure) was slightly weaker and of nonworking day and recreational exposure much weaker. Occupational exposure in women was much less strongly correlated with total exposure than it was in men possibly because of their frequently combined work and family roles, which the questionnaires did not try to separate. Research is needed into how this might be done to improve sun exposure measurement in women.",Excluded,0.69032913
845,"Long-term quality of life and tumour control following gamma knife radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma Introduction: Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has for the last decades been an established treatment option for patients with small- or medium-sized vestibular schwannomas (VS), although little data is reported on long-term outcome regarding quality of life (QOL) and tumour control in this patient category. The objective of this study was to investigate long-term QOL and tumour control in GKRS-treated VS patients at our institution. Method(s): Data was reviewed from a consecutive cohort of 128 patients, 62 men and 66 women, diagnosed with VS and treated with GKRS at Karolinska University Hospital between 1997 and 2003. Patients previously treated for VS, patients from abroad, and patients with neurofibromatosis were excluded from the study. Median age at the time of treatment was 66 years (range 23-89), with a median follow-up time of 104 months (range 11-165) and radiological median follow-up of 86 months (range 5-170). Five patients were lost to follow-up. Result(s): Data on QOL (EQ-5D score) was obtained in 90 % (98/109) of all cases at the end of follow-up, showing low morbidity and a high QOL with median index of 0.91 (max. score 1.0) in these patients. Tumour control was achieved in 92 % (118/128) of patients after a single GKRS treatment. Ten patients had loss of tumour control, either radiologically seen as growth progression, or due to the need for salvage treatment. Neither pre-treatment growth of the vestibular schwannoma, or a large tumour size (Koos grade 3 & 4) was correlated with a higher degree of treatment failure (p = 0.695 and p = 0.647, respectively). There was no difference in tumour control in young (<60 y/o) vs. elderly (>=60 y/o) patients (p = 0.167). Conclusion(s): We report a high QOL and low morbidity at long-term follow-up after GKRS treatment in VS patients. Furthermore, a high tumour control rate was achieved independent of tumour size, patient age or pre-treatment evidence of tumour growth. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.",Excluded,0.68980646

The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a potential alternative tool for the management of this pest, however, only conflicting data is found regarding the optimal dose to achieve sterility. Thus, this study evaluated the effect of gamma radiation doses (0, 40, 50, 60 and 70 Gy) on male and female reproductive sterility, gonads morphometry, emergence, flight ability, and longevity under nutritional stress of A. fraterculus. Full female sterility was achieved at 50 Gy, while full male sterility was achieved at 70 Gy.

39,"Radiographic joint damage and mortality in rheumatoid arthritis patients: 20 years survival study Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with increased mortality and reduced life expectancy compared with the general population. This mortality gap has increased in the last years since mortality rates for RA have remained constant throughout time while mortality rates for the general population have decline. Excess mortality has been associated with disease activity. Radiographic joint destruction reflects the cumulative burden of inflammation and it is conceived as an objective measure of RA severity. Objectives The objective of our study is to analyze the influence of radiological joint damage in the mortality rate in a cohort of RA patients. Methods We included 783 RA patients in a retrospective longitudinal study, from May 1993 to November 2013, attending the rheumatology outpatient clinic of the Hospital Clinico San Carlos (Madrid, Spain). Subjects were included at the moment of their first X-ray, until October 2012, and followed until patients' death, loss of follow up or November 2013. Clinical records were examined and demographic and clinical data was collected. Radiographic joint damage of hands and wrists was assessed with the Sharp vand-der-Heijde score [total (SHS), erosion (ES) and narrowing/(sub)luxation (NSLS) components]. Survival techniques were applied to estimate the mortality rate (MR; expressed per 1000 patients-years with a 95% of Confidence Interval [95% CI]). Cox bivariate and multivariate regression models were conducted to examine risk factors for death. Interaction terms between radiological damage and rheumatoid factor (RF) positivity, and the elapsed time from RA onset to X-ray, were introduce in the models. Proportional hazard assumption was tested using Schoenfeld residuals and the scaled Schoenfeld residuals. Results were expressed as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI. Results Most of the patients included were women (74%), with a median age of 61 years old (interquartile range [IQR]: 47-71), 67% were RF positive, and the median (IQR) elapsed time between RA symptoms onset and the X-ray was 2 (0-7) years. The median (range) followed up time per patient was 5 [0.4-20] years. 92 patients died during a follow up time of 4758 person-years. Mortality rate was 19 per 1000 patient-year [95% CI 16-24]. We observed in the bivariate analysis that older age, male sex, higher elapsed time from RA onset to X-ray, SHS, ES, NSLS, number of hospital admissions (used as a surrogate measure of comorbidity), basal Health Assessment Questionnaire, RF positivity, earlier RA onset (in calendar time), and no treatment with biological therapy, were associated with a higher MR. 3 multivariate models were constructed, using SHS, ES or NSLS as measures for joint destruction, and adjusted by the previous variables. In none of the models radiographic damage was associated with MR. However, we observed that the interaction between ES and RF positivity and with elapsed time from RA onset to X-ray were both significant (p=0.001, p=0.03, respectively): the lower elapsed time, the greater the effect of ES in the MR. On the other hand, ES was associated to MR only in RF negative patients. Conclusions Erosive joint damage seems to be a risk factor for all cause mortality among RF negative RA patients. Early radiographic damage seems to better predict mortality.",Excluded,0.6838928

469,"Health profiles of 996 melanoma survivors: The M. D. Anderson experience Background: The incidence and survival of melanoma are increasing, but little is known about its long-term health effects in adult survivors. Method(s): A health survey was available from 996 melanoma survivors (577 treated with surgery alone, and 391 with combined treatments). Their medical/physiologic and psychosocial responses were analyzed and compared with those of the survivors from other cancers. Result(s): The melanoma survivors were 44.8 +/- 12.8 years of age at diagnosis (significantly younger than the survivors of other cancers) and 63.7 +/- 12.8 years at survey. Melanoma survivors were less likely to report that cancer had affected their health than survivors of other cancers (15.8% vs. 34.9%). The 577 individuals treated with surgery alone reported arthritis/osteoporosis, cataracts, and heart problems most frequently (less often than survivors of other cancers). The 391 individuals who had undergone combined treatments reported circulation problems and kidney problems generally as often as survivors of other cancers. Health problems were not associated with number of decades since diagnosis but with age at diagnosis, treatment modality, and family relationships. Conclusion(s): We present information from a large cohort of long-term survivors of melanoma. As a group, they were less likely to report that cancer had affected their overall health than survivors of other cancers; a number of disease related and psychosocial factors appear to influence their health profiles. © 2006 Stava et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded,0.669526

Methods Of 48 consecutively treated patients with neoadjuvant CRT, we selected 20 EAC ypN0 patients (group 1). These patients were matched with 20 pN0 EAC patients who had surgery alone (group 2). Harvested (y)pN0 lymph nodes were examined immunohistochemically (anti-CK8/18 [CAM 5.2]) according to a validated sentinel node protocol. A 3rd group (n = 11) staged as ypN1 after neoadjuvant CRT was used as the control group. Results Upstaging to NMM+ occurred in 2 patients (10%) in group 1 and in 8 patients (40%) in group 2 (P =.028). Disease-free and overall survival rates in NMM+ patients in group 1 were worse compared with NMM- patients (P =.014 and P =.003, respectively) but comparable with ypN1 patients (n = 11). Conclusions A 30% reduction of NMM+ was obtained after neoadjuvant treatment in (y)pN0 patients. NMM+ after CRT had a negative impact on survival in ypN1 patients. These data warrant further investigation in larger prospective datasets. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.6514831
890,"Frequency and etiology of ventilator-associated events in the medical intensive care unit Background: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed new criteria based on a significant deterioration in oxygenation to identify ventilator-associated events (conditions). The aim of this study was to determine how frequently this happened and what caused these conditions. Method(s): Electronic medical records and x-rays from 281 ventilator episodes in the medical intensive care unit were reviewed to determine the characteristics of patients requiring ventilation and the number of patients meeting the criteria for ventilatorassociated conditions (VACs). Result(s): This cohort included 257 patients (55.4% men) who required 281 episodes of mechanical ventilation. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Healthy Evaluation II score was 13.5 +/- 5.9. The initial mean PaO2/FiO2 was 210 +/- 110. The median number of ventilator days was 4 (interquartile range: 3-9). The overall mortality was 32.3%. Nineteen patients (11.7% of eligible episodes) met the CDC criteria for a VAC; 6 met FiO2 criteria (31.6%) and 13 met positive end expiratory pressure criteria (68.4%). Twelve patients (63.2%) had an increased white blood cell count (>12k/muL) during the event. Eleven patients had an increase in temperature (.38degreeC) during this period. The etiology of these conditions included pneumonia (n = 4), atelectasis (n = 4), congestive heart failure (n = 5), acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 2), and miscellaneous reasons (n = 4). Conclusion(s): VACs occurred in 11.7% of patients in our medical intensive care unit. The etiology of these events was diverse and did not usually reflect complications. These new CDC criteria for institutional reporting of complications during mechanical ventilation do not necessarily identify complications or provide a good method for comparing outcomes in hospitals.© Copyright by the Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.",Excluded,0.65088636
304,"Influence of previous radiation exposure on pathologic features and clinical outcome in patients with thyroid cancer Objective: To determine whether previous radiation exposure to the head and neck is related to less favorable pathologic and clinical outcome in patients after surgical management of thyroid cancer. Design(s): Retrospective chart review. Setting(s): Academic teaching hospital (referral center). Patient(s): All patients with diagnosed thyroid cancer who had been exposed to radiation before surgical treatment were retrospectively identified from the thyroid cancer database at our institution (1963-2007). One hundred twenty-five patients (95 women and 30 men) were included. Inclusion criteria included surgical treatment for thyroid cancer and a history of exposure to radiation at least 3 years before diagnosis of the disease. Main Outcome Measure(s): Pathologic features and data related to disease recurrence, distant metastasis, and survival. Result(s): Mean (range) age at first exposure to radiation was 19.4 (1-65) years, and mean lag time to diagnosis of disease was 28.7 (3-60) years. Patients were treated surgically with either total or near-total thyroidectomy (83%) or partial or subtotal thyroidectomy (17%). Pathologic diagnoses included 111 papillary carcinomas (89%). Sixty- three percent of patients had multifocal disease, 12% had lymphovascular tumor invasion, and 26% had direct ex- trathyroid extension of disease. Twenty-five percent of patients had metastases to cervical lymph nodes, and 9% had distant metastases. Sixteen percent of patients experienced local recurrence of disease. At last follow-up, 86% of patients were alive and free of disease, 8% were alive with disease, 4% had died of thyroid cancer, and 2% had died of an unrelated cause. Compared with other patients with thyroid cancer, this radiation-exposed cohort was more likely to undergo total thyroidectomy, multiple operative procedures, and external radiotherapy. A higher percentage had multifocal disease, extrathyroid extension, stage IV disease, and distant metastases. At follow-up, fewer patients were free of disease, and more patients had died of thyroid disease. Conclusion(s): Patients who have been exposed to radiation have more aggressive disease and worse clinical outcome than other patients with thyroid cancer. © 2009 American Medical Association.

868,"Radiation-induced sarcoma of head and neck: 50 years of experience at a single institution in an endemic area of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in China Radiation-induced sarcoma in the head and neck (RISHN) is a rare condition whose clinical presentation and management remain difficult because of its low incidence. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the symptoms, diagnosis, and the treatment of 16,634 patients with head and neck disease, who received radiotherapy between 1960 and 2010 at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital and its predecessor, Guangxi Medical University, China. Among these patients, 16 with a first tumor of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and 1 with squamous carcinoma of the tongue met the criteria of RISHN in the head and neck. Our epidemiological data showed that the incidence of RISHN rose from 0.06 to 0.17% from 1960 to 2010; the 3-year overall survival rate was 19.1%, and 3-year diseasefree survival rate was 11.1%. The mean latency (SD) period was 93.2 (33) months. Based on the experiences at our institution, we suggest that RISHN is a rare complication after radiotherapy for head and neck tumors, especially NPC. Owing to its low incidence, it should not be a major factor affecting decisions about radiotherapy. Nevertheless, there may be a possibility of increasing incidence of RISHN after radiotherapy of NPC, as shown in our epidemiological results. Given the poor prognosis of RISHN, this possibility should be taken into serious consideration before determination of high-dose radiotherapy for patients with NPC and other head and neck tumors. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",Excluded,0.63796616

660,"Site-specific cancer incidence and mortality after cerebral angiography with radioactive thorotrast Few opportunities exist to evaluate the carcinogenic effects of long-term internal exposure to alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides. Patients injected with Thorotrast (thorium-232) during radiographic procedures, beginning in the 1930s, provide one such valuable opportunity. We evaluated site-specific cancer incidence and mortality among an international cohort of 3,042 patients injected during cerebral angiography with either Thorotrast (n = 1,650) or a nonradioactive agent (n = 1,392) and who survived 2 or more years. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for Thorotrast and comparison patients (Denmark and Sweden) were estimated and relative risks (RR), adjusted for population, age and sex, were generated with multivariate statistical modeling. For U.S. patients, comparable procedures were used to estimate standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and RR, representing the first evaluation of long-term, site-specific cancer mortality in this group. Compared with nonexposed patients, significantly increased risks in Thorotrast patients were observed for all incident cancers combined (RR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.9-4.1, n = 480, Denmark and Sweden) and for cancer mortality (RR = 4.0, 95% CI 2.5-6.7, n = 114, U.S.). Approximately 335 incident cancers were above expectation, with large excesses seen for cancers of the liver, bile ducts and gallbladder (55% or 185 excess cancers) and leukemias other than CLL (8% or 26 excess cancers). The RR of all incident cancers increased with time since angiography (P < 0.001) and was threefold at 40 or more years; significant excesses (SIR = 4.0) persisted for 50 years. Increasing cumulative dose of radiation was associated with an increasing risk of all incident cancers taken together and with cancers of the liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum and other digestive sites; similar findings were observed for U.S. cancer mortality. A marginally significant dose response was observed for the incidence of pancreas cancer (P = 0.05) but not for lung cancer. Our study confirms the relationship between Thorotrast and increased cancer incidence at sites of Thorotrast deposition and suggests a possible association with pancreas cancer. After injection with >20 ml Thorotrast, the cumulative excess risk of cancer incidence remained elevated for up to 50 years and approached 97%. Caution is needed in interpreting the excess risks observed for site-specific cancers, however, because of the potential bias associated with the selection of cohort participants, noncomparability with respect to the internal or external comparison groups, and confounding by indication. Nonetheless, the substantial risks associated with liver cancer and leukemia indicate that unique and prolonged exposure to alpha-particle-emitting Thorotrast increased carcinogenic risks.",Excluded,0.6358327
881,"Human Determinants and the Role of Melanocortin-1 Receptor Variants in Melanoma Risk Independent of UV Radiation Exposure IMPORTANCE: Despite the unquestioned relationship of UV radiation (UVR) exposure and melanoma development, UVR-independent development of melanoma has only recently been described in mice. These findings in mice highlight the importance of the genetic background of the host and could be relevant for preventive measures in humans., OBJECTIVE: To study the role of the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) and melanoma risk independently from UVR in a clinical setting., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Hospital-based case-control study, including genetic testing, questionnaires, and physical data (Molecular Markers of Melanoma Study data set) including 991 melanoma patients (cases) and 800 controls., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association of MC1R variants and melanoma risk independent from sun exposure variables., RESULTS: The 1791 participants included 991 with a diagnosis of melanoma and 800 control patients (mean [SD] age, 59.2 [15.6] years; 50.5% male). Compared with wild-type carriers, carriers of MC1R variants were at higher melanoma risk after statistically adjusting for previous UVR exposure (represented by prior sunburns and signs of actinic skin damage identified by dermatologists), age, and sex compared with wild-type carriers (>=2 variants, OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.66-2.75], P < .001; P for trend <.001). After adjustment for sex, age, sunburns in the past, and signs of actinic skin damage, the associations remained significant (OR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.02-2.67] for R/R, OR, 2.63 [95% CI, 1.82-3.81] for R/r; OR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.36-2.48] for R/0; and OR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.01-2.21] for r/r, with P values ranging from <.001 to .04 when adjusted for facial actinic skin damage; OR, 2.36 [95% CI, 1.62-3.43] for R/r; and OR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.08-1.99] for R/0 with P values ranging from <.001 to .01 when adjusted for dorsal actinic skin damage; and OR, 2.54 [95% CI, 1.76-3.67] for R/r, OR, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.30-2.36] for R/0; and OR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.02-2.20] for r/r with P values ranging from <.001 to .04 when adjusted for actinic skin damage on the hands)., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Carriers of MC1R variants were at increased melanoma risk independent of their sun exposure.

839,"Ultraviolet-B induces ERCC6 repression in lens epithelium cells of age-related nuclear cataract through coordinated DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation Background: Ultraviolet-B (UVB) exposure attributes to the formation of age-related nuclear cataract (ARNC), which is mediated with DNA damage. DNA damage, an important factor for pathogenesis of ARNC, is induced by UVB, and is generally resolved by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) repair mechanism. Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB) protein coded by ERCC6 is a vital component for NER. However, we found no association between selected ERCC6 polymorphisms and ARNC. In this study, we investigated whether UVB exposure could alter ERCC6 expression and the process could involve epigenetic changes of DNA methylation and/or histone acetylation of ERCC6 in the lens epithelial cells (LECs). We also assessed the involvement of those coordinated changes in lens tissue from ARNC patients. Result(s): mRNA and protein expression of ERCC6 in lens tissue (LECs) were lower in ARNCs than those in the controls. This reduction corresponded to methylation of a CpG site at the ERCC6 promoter and histone modifications (methylation and acetylation) nearby this site. UVB-treated human lens epithelium B3 (HLE-B3) and 239T cell presented (1) increased apoptosis, suggesting reduced UV-damage repair, (2) hypermethylation of the CpG site located at position -441 (relative to transcription start site) within the binding region for transcriptional factor Sp1 in the ERCC6 promoter, (3) the enhancement of histone H3K9 deacetylation, (4) induction in DNA methyltransferases 3b (DNMT3b) and histone deacetylase1 (HDAC1) associated to the CpG site of ERCC6 by CHIP assay. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest an orchestrated mechanism triggered by UVB radiation where the concurrent association of specific hypermethylation CpG site, H3K9 deacetylation of ERCC6, and repression of ERCC6 gene expression. Taken together, with the similar changes in the lens tissue from ARNC patients, our data unveiled a possible mechanism of epigenetic modification of DNA repair gene in the pathogenesis of ARNC.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.6287568

Method(s): The present study is a retrospective analysis. Cases of hematologic malignancies and associated pre-malignant conditions were collected from the regional Central North Dakota Cancer Registry, and analysis of study-specific demographic factors was performed. Result(s): Significantly higher incidence of hematologic cancers and pre-malignant disorders was associated with residence in an ""urban"" county and rural city/town. Within the latter designation, there was a higher rate of self-reported agricultural occupation (40% vs 10%, P < 0.0001).

371,"Analysis of radiation therapy in 1054 patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) treated during 1985-2009 Purpose/Objective(s): Since 15 years ago, our group has conducted nationwide surveys of PCNSL seen at radiation therapy (RT) departments in Japan. The vast majority of the surveyed institutions are university hospitals. So far, data on 1,054 patients treated between 1985 and 2009 have been collected. The purpose of this study was to analyze RT and evaluate treatment outcome in these patients. Materials/Methods: Subjects of the survey were patients with histologically- proven PCNSL who received RT, including those who did not complete planned treatment. Clinical characteristics, treatment and prognosis of the patients were asked using a detailed questionnaire. Data on 466 patients seen between 1985 and 1994 were collected from 62 institutions, and 273 patients seen between 1995 and 2004 were collected from 30 institutions. Most recently, 315 patients seen between 2005 and 2009 were collected from 20 institutions. Thus, 1,054 patients (630 men and 424 women; median age, 62 years) were evaluable. No patients had AIDSrelated PCNSL. Among the patients, 696 were dead and 358 were alive or lost to follow-up. Median follow-up period for living patients was 37 months. Result(s): For all 1,054 patients, the median survival time (MST) was 24 months and the 5-year survival rate (5YSR) was 25.8%. The MST and 5YSR were 23 months and 24.8%, respectively, for 969 patients treated with whole-brain RT and 25.5 months and 29%, respectively, for 85 patients treated with partial-brain RT (p = 0.80). Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the total radiation dose: (1) 30-39.9 Gy; (2) 40- 49.9 Gy; (3) 50-53.9 Gy; and (4) >= 54 Gy. Patients receiving < 30 Gy were excluded. The MST and 5YSR were significantly better in the group receiving 40-49.9 Gy than in the other groups (5YSR was 24%, 32%, 25%, and 21% for groups 1-4, respectively; all p < 0.05 against group 2 receiving 40-49.9 Gy). Even when the analysis was limited to patients receiving high-dose methotrexate containing chemotherapy and RT, the survival rate was similarly the best in the group receiving 40-49.9 Gy (5YSR was 41%, 51%, 37%, and 37% for groups 1-4, respectively). Patients receiving a whole-brain dose < 40 Gy had better survival than those receiving >= 40 Gy (5YSR: 32% vs 20%, p = 0.0005). For patients receiving high-dose methotrexate containing chemotherapy and partial brain RT (>= 30 Gy), the 5YSR was 51%. Conclusion(s): This large retrospective analysis suggests that the optimal total dose to the tumor may be in the range 40-49.9 Gy, even in combination with methotrexate-containing chemotherapy. Patients receiving partial-brain RT had a prognosis similar to those receiving while-brain RT. The whole-brain dose >= 40 Gy did not seem to be associated with better survival. Partial-brain RT with high-dose methotrexate may worth consideration for patients with a single PCNSL.",Excluded,0.62253946
266,"The secondary sex ratio in Italy over the past eighty years (1940 to 2019) and potential impact of radiological contamination after atmospheric nuclear testing and after Chernobyl: Temporal change-point analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo In Europe, the male to female ratio at birth (secondary sex ratio: SSR; sex odds: SO) is 1.04-1.06, is influenced by many factors and is declining in industrialized countries. This study was carried out to identify possible impacts of fallout by atomic bomb tests or by the Chernobyl event on SSR in Italy. Italy is a country without commercial nuclear power generation for the last four decades and thus nearly free of radiological confounders. Counts of annual male and female live births in Italy are provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by the Italian Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT). This study included 57.7 million live births (1940-2019) with overall SSR 1.05829. The Italian SSR trend was modelled with linear and non-linear logistic regression. Trend changes, i.e., periods with level shifts were estimated with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Two distinct idealized level shifts were identified superimposed on a uniform secular downward trend. The first one is seen towards the end of the 1960s with a jump sex odds ratio (SOR) 1.00681, p < 0.0001. The second one occurred in 1987 with SOR 1.00474, p < 0.0001. In each of the 3 periods separated by the two jumps, SSR uniformly decreased with trend SOR per 100 years of 0.98549, p < 0.0001. In conclusion, the secular trend in the Italian SSR showed two marked level shifts, at the end of the 1960s and from 1987 onward. These follow the release of radioactivity by atmospheric atomic bomb tests during the 1960s and by Chernobyl in 1986 and corroborate the hypothesis that ionizing radiation increases SSR.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.6202354

In contrast to upward trends observed for older men and women (i.e., over 40), downward trends were noted for younger age groups. The risk of dying from skin melanoma appears to have peaked for male cohorts born during the 1950s and for female cohorts born during the 1930s. Assuming no future environmental or lifestyle changes, the upward trend in age-adjusted mortality rates, which averaged 2 to 3% per annum since 1950, is projected to discontinue and bend downward by the second decade of the 21st century. Skin melanoma incidence data, which was limited to a series of 12 years (1973-84) and inadequate for cohort analyses, were included to demonstrate that trends in age-specific rates were comparable with those observed for mortality during the overlapping time period. Incidence trends according to anatomical site are also described.

1108,"Efficacy and safety of intensity-modulated radiotherapy following transarterial chemoembolization in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been beneficial in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There have been few clinical reports on the use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in combination with TACE for these patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of IMRT following TACE in unresectable HCC. The medical records of consecutive patients with unresectable HCC, who underwent IMRT following TACE from January 2009 to June 2014, were retrospectively reviewed in order to assess the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response, and treatment-associated toxicity. A total of 64 lesions in 54 patients were included in the analysis. IMRT was delivered at a median dose of 50 Gy (range 44-70 Gy) at 1.8 to 2.0 Gy per fraction. The overall response rate was achieved in 64.8% of patients with complete response in 20.4% of patients at 3 months after completion of IMRT. The median OS was 20.2 months (95% CI=8.6-31.9), and the actuarial 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 84.6%, 49.7%, and 36.7%, respectively. The median PFS was 10.5 months (95% CI=7.3-13.7) and the 1-, 2-, and 3-year PFS rates were 44.2%, 23.4%, and 14.6%, respectively. The responders had a significantly higher OS rate than the nonresponders (3-year OS 48.0% vs 14.4%, P=0.001). During and the first month following IMRT, 10 (18.5%) patients developed grade 3 hematological toxicity, and 3 (5.6%) developed grade 3 hepatic toxicity. No patient experienced grade 4 or 5 toxicity. Radiation-induced liver disease was not observed. Our findings suggest that IMRT following TACE could be a favorable treatment option for both its safety profile and clinical benefit in patients with unresectable HCC.Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded,0.61276543

Method(s): We determined the genotype and allele distributions of rs1800469 (C-509T), rs1800470 (C869T), rs189037 (A-111G), and rs373759 (126713 G>A) in 141 Han Chinese patients who underwent definitive thoracic radiotherapy (50 to 77 Gy, 5 days/wk) for lung cancer (small cell or non-small cell tumors, n = 97), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC, n = 27), or mediastinal cancer (n = 17). Clinical variables were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models to calculate the relative risk of RP associated with the clinical variables, and a Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the SNP genotypes and alleles and the incidence of RP for the various risk factors. Result(s): The T alleles of rs1800470 (CT/TT) and rs1800469 (CT/TT) and the G allele of rs189037 (GA/GG) were associated with the risk of >= grade-2 RP in the ESCC patients (P = 0.0006, P = 0.0127, and P = 0.0412, respectively), and that the A alleles of rs189037 (AG/AA) and rs373759 (AG/AA) were associated with the risk of >= grade-2 RP in the patients with mediastinal cancer (P = 0.0063 and P = 0.0003, respectively). None of the SNP genotypes were associated with the risk of RP in lung cancer patients. Conclusion(s): The T alleles of the rs1800470 (CT/TT) and rs1800469 (CT/TT) SNPs of TGFbeta1 and the G allele of the rs189037 (GA/GG) SNP of ATM are independent risk factors for RP in Chinese ESCC patients, and the A alleles of the rs189037 (AG/AA) and rs373759 (AG/AA) SNPs of ATM are independent risk factors for RP in Chinese patients with mediastinal cancer. These SNPs might represent useful biomarkers for personalizing radiotherapy regimens for Chinese patients with ESCC or mediastinal cancer to reduce the incidence of RP. Large-cohort studies of these SNPs in thoracic cancer patients are warranted.Copyright © 2015, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.61125034
913,"Radiation Exposure to solar and ionizing radiation increases the risk for cancer in humans. Some 5% of solar radiation is within the ultraviolet spectrum and may cause both malignant melanoma and non-melanocytic skin cancer; the latter is regarded as a benign disease and is accordingly not included in our estimation of avoidable cancers. Under the assumption that the rate of occurrence of malignant melanoma of the buttocks of both men and women and of the scalp of women would apply to all parts of the body in people completely unexposed to solar radiation, it was estimated that approximately 95% of all malignant melanomas arising in the Nordic populations around the year 2000 will be due to exposure to natural ultraviolet radiation, equivalent to an annual number of about 4700 cases, with 2100 in men and 2600 in women, or some 4% of all cancers notified. Exposure to ionizing radiation in the Nordic countries occurs at an average effective dose per capita per year of about 3 mSv (Iceland, 1.1 mSv) from natural sources, and about 1 mSv from man-made sources. While the natural sources are primarily radon in indoor air, natural radionuclides in food, cosmic radiation and gamma radiation from soil and building materials, the man-made sources are dominated by the diagnostic and therapeutic use of ionizing radiation. On the basis of measured levels of radon in Nordic dwellings and associated risk estimates for lung cancer derived from well-conducted epidemiological studies, we estimated that about 180 cases of lung cancer (1% of all lung cancer cases) per year could be avoided in the Nordic countries around the year 2000 if indoor exposure to radon were eliminated, and that an additional 720 cases (6%) could be avoided annually if either radon or tobacco smoking were eliminated. Similarly, it was estimated that the exposure of the Nordic populations to natural sources of ionizing radiation other than radon and to medical sources will each give rise to an annual total of 2120 cancers at various sites. For all types of ionizing radiation, the annual total will be 4420 cancer cases, or 3.9% of all cancers arising in the Nordic populations, with 3.4% in men and 4.4% in women.",Excluded,0.6044819
372,"NRF2 mutation confers malignant potential and resistance to chemoradiation therapy in advanced esophageal squamous cancer Esophageal squamous cancer (ESC) is one of the most aggressive tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. A combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT) has improved the clinical outcome, but the molecular background determining the effectiveness of therapy remains unknown. NRF2 is a master transcriptional regulator of stress adaptation, and gain of-function mutation of NRF2 in cancer confers resistance to stressors including anticancer therapy. Direct resequencing analysis revealed that Nrf2 gain-of-function mutation occurred recurrently (18/82, 22%) in advanced ESC tumors and ESC cell lines (3/10). The presence of Nrf2 mutation was associated with tumor recurrence and poor prognosis. Short hairpin RNA-mediated down-regulation of NRF2 in ESC cells that harbor only mutated Nrf2 allele revealed that themutant NRF2 conferred increased cell proliferation, attachment-independent survival, and resistance to 5-fluorouracil and gamma-irradiation. Based on the Nrf2 mutation status, gene expression signatures associated with NRF2 mutation were extracted from ESC cell lines, and their potential utility for monitoring and prognosis was examined in a cohort of 33 pre-CRT cases of ESC. The molecular signatures of NRF2 mutation were significantly predictive and prognostic for CRT response. In conclusion, recurrent NRF2 mutation confers malignant potential and resistance to therapy in advanced ESC, resulting in a poorer outcome. Molecular signatures of NRF2 mutation can be applied as predictive markers of response to CRT, and efficient inhibition of aberrant NRF2 activation could be a promising approach in combination with CRT.",Excluded,0.60128295
751,"Effect of Amifostine to prevent radiotherapy-induced acute and late toxicity in head and neck cancer patients who had normal or mild impaired salivary gland function BACKGROUND: Amifostine has a potential role for salivary gland protection in head and neck cancer patients who had radiotherapy., MATERIAL AND METHOD: Sixty-seven head and neck cancer patients were randomized to receive radiotherapy or radiotherapy plus Amifostine. The efficacy of the treatment was determined by a questionnaire evaluating dryness of mouth and the oral comfort, the RTOG/EORTC acute/late radiation morbidity scoring criteria, collection of the whole saliva and the 99mTc-pertecnetate scintigraphy of the salivary glands., RESULTS: Amifostine significantly reduced the mean questionnaire scores from 6.49 to 3.73, the incidence of grade > or = 2 mucositis from 75% to 36% and acute xerostomia from 82% to 39%. The salivary gland function returned to normal at a rate of 36.3% in the Amifostine group versus 9.1% in the control group., CONCLUSION: Amifostine is effective in reducing the incidence and severity of acute mucositis, acute and late xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients.",Excluded,0.6007783
634,"What can space radiation protection learn from radiation oncology? Protection from cosmic radiation of crews of long-term space missions is now becoming an urgent requirement to allow a safe colonization of the moon and Mars. Epidemiology provides little help to quantify the risk, because the astronaut group is small and as yet mostly involved in low-Earth orbit mission, whilst the usual cohorts used for radiation protection on Earth (e.g. atomic bomb survivors) were exposed to a radiation quality substantially different from the energetic charged particle field found in space. However, there are over 260,000 patients treated with accelerated protons or heavier ions for different types of cancer, and this cohort may be useful for quantifying the effects of space-like radiation in humans. Space radiation protection and particle therapy research also share the same tools and devices, such as accelerators and detectors, as well as several research topics, from nuclear fragmentation cross sections to the radiobiology of densely ionizing radiation. The transfer of the information from the cancer radiotherapy field to space is manifestly complicated, yet the two field should strengthen their relationship and exchange methods and data.Copyright © 2021",Excluded,0.59887886
590,"Relationship between body composition and development of diabetes in non-obese Japanese subjects Background : Body mass index (BMI) is a simple and good index to detect individuals with high risk of developing diabetes, though not all obese people develop diabetes. In comparison with populations in USA and Europe, Asian populations have a lower frequency of obesity, and a relatively higher risk of diabetes in non-obese populations. Although epidemiology studies reveal association between body composition and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, very few studies have examined the relationship between body composition and these risk factors in non-obese subjects. Objectives : The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to examine association of body composition with incidence of diabetes, a CVD risk factor, in non-obese Japanese subjects. Methods : The subjects of this study were 1,137 non-obese subjects without diabetes at baseline (368 males and 769 females, with an average age of 65.2) in the Hiroshima Adult Health Study that consists of atomic bomb survivors and their controls. Body composition was estimated by whole body DXA during the period from 1994 through 1996. We used percentages of trunk, leg, and arm fat in relation to total soft tissue mass as surrogate indicators of body fat distribution, and the ratio of appendicular lean mass/height2 (ALM/H2) as a surrogate indicator of appendicular muscle mass volume. Diabetes was defined by fasting glucose >=126mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L) or random glucose >= 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), a history of diabetes diagnosis by a medical institution, or current treatment for diabetes. Results : During the follow-up period lasting until 2011, 133 subjects developed diabetes. In Cox regression analyses with adjustment for BMI, presence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, radiation dose, and smoking and alcohol consumption status, significant negative association was observed between ALM/H2 and diabetes risk in men. Regarding body fat distribution, trunk fat percentage was positively associated with the incidence of diabetes and it was statistically significant only in men. On the other hand, leg fat percentage was significantly and negatively associated with the incidence of diabetes in women. . Significant association between the percentage of arm fat and diabetes risk was not observed in either gender. Conclusions : Among non-obese subjects, we found body composition to be associated with diabetes risk. Therefore, for Japanese people, body composition may be a useful tool for identifying individuals with high risk of developing diabetes.",Excluded,0.58696395
1057,"Prevalence of anxiety in patients awaiting diagnostic procedures in an oncology center in Brazil Objective: Anxiety disorders have been shown to undermine the quality of life of cancer patients. Unfortunately, medical professionals often neglect to screen for anxiety in their patients. The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of anxiety in patients awaiting diagnostic procedures in an oncology center waiting room, and to investigate possible relationships between anxiety and demographic and clinical variables. Method(s): A cross-sectional study was performed with 398 patients who completed a self-administered questionnaire containing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Result(s): Results of the HADS indicated that 38% of participants had anxiety, while data from the STAI showed that 46% had either high state or trait anxiety. The most frequently cited source of anxiety was concern over test results. Age, gender, employment status, and education level were correlated with anxiety. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of anxiety is high among patients awaiting diagnostic procedures. Patients in the waiting room should be routinely screened for anxiety. Careful assessment and treatment of anxiety are important components in the care of patients with cancer. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Excluded,0.58588094
675,"Proton Pump Inhibitor Exposure and Acute Myocardial Infarction Risk: A Nested Cohort Study Background: Association of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) exposure with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) risk in the Caucasian population remains under debate. Here, we clarified whether PPI exposure might be related to an increased new-onset AMI risk in an Asian population. Method(s): Data of 27,624 patients with PPI exposure followed by new-onset AMI development were extracted from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database and age- and sex-matched with 27,624 controls with PPIs exposure, but without subsequent AMI and ischemic heart disease development. The amount of PPI exposure was calculated based on the cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) during the follow-up period. Subsequent AMI risk was measured after adjustments of demographic data and indication of PPI use. Result(s): AMI risk increased with an increase in PPI exposure: with cDDD <= 30 as the reference, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for cDDDs of > 365 was 1.56 (1.45-1.69). All five PPI categories, including pantoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole, increased AMI risk. Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrated long-term or high-dose PPI exposure associated with increased new-onset AMI risk in patients without a history of any ischemic heart disease. The underlying mechanisms of PPI-related cardiovascular effects deserve more investigation.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Excluded,0.5791526
422,"Altered proliferation and differentiation of human epidermis in cases of skin fibrosis after radiotherapy PURPOSE: To characterize, at the histopathologic and molecular levels, the irradiated epidermis in cases of human skin fibrosis induced by radiotherapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Surgical samples were obtained from 6 patients who had developed cutaneous fibronecrotic lesions from 7 months to 27 years after irradiation. The proliferation and differentiation status of the irradiated epidermis was characterized with specific markers using immunohistochemical methods., RESULTS: All samples presented with hyperplasia of the epidermis associated with local inflammation. The scar epidermis exhibited an increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which revealed hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Furthermore, an abnormal differentiation was found, characterized by the expression of K6 and K16, and by alterations in protein amounts and localization of cytokeratins, involucrin, and transforming growth factor-beta1., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that late damage of irradiated skin is not only characterized by fibrosis in the dermis but also by hyperplasia in the epidermis. This hyperplasia was due to both hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes.",Excluded,0.57417375
518,"The Use of Public Health Indicators to Assess Individual Happiness in Post-Disaster Recovery PURPOSE: Very few studies have examined the influential factors of survivors' feelings of happiness in the context of nuclear accidents. This paper aims to fill this gap with reference to the recovery process in Fukushima City following the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami in Japan., METHODS: Open access data were sourced from the 2015 Social Survey on Living and Disaster Recovery (SSLDR) (N = 1439) of Fukushima citizens. Pearson's Chi-square Test and the t-test were employed to examine gender differences with regard to happiness and exploratory variables. Following this, a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the determinants of happiness., RESULTS: The results showed that, compared to females, male respondents were unhappier and reported more property loss and less neighborhood connectedness. Individuals' mental and physical health and neighborhood connectedness were found to be significantly correlated with their happiness. However, the disaster-related variables of people's evaluation of recovery achievement, concerns around the health impacts of radiation, property loss in the disaster, and experiences of casualty, had no effects on happiness., CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that policies and countermeasures dealing with disaster recovery over the long term should continuously focus on health issues and social relationships.",Excluded,0.5669864
803,"Scintigraphic studies of rectal emptying in patients with constipation and defecatory difficulty We prospectively evaluated 38 adult patients with chronic constipation with and without defecatory difficulties using a newly described scintigraphic test to measure rectal emptying and compared them to 20 healthy controls. All patients underwent anorectal manometry, and 30 who complained of infrequent defecation underwent a colonic transit study using radiopaque markers. Control subjects promptly evacuated both 100 ml and 200 ml artificial stool in a characteristic fashion, but three evacuated none of the 100-ml volume and two had no evacuation of the 200-ml stool (inhibited controls). Constipated patients exhibited three patterns of emptying: (1) normal emptying of both volumes (47%); (2) poor emptying of both volumes or inhibited defecation (29%); and (3) normal emptying of the 200-ml but abnormal evacuation of the 100-ml volume (24%). An abnormal expulsion pattern during manometry occurred in 21% of patients and was strongly associated with the inhibited defecation pattern. However, defecation patterns could not be predicted on the basis of age, gender, symptoms, duration of complaints, colonic transit, or other rectal manometric parameters. Although rectal scintigraphy has potential advantages as a diagnostic test in terms of quantitation and decreased radiation exposure, the inability of the test to distinguish patients with slow transit constipation and defecatory complaints makes the potential utility of this test of uncertain value in clinical and investigative settings.",Excluded,0.5647591
527,"Preoperative radiotherapy contributes to induction of proliferative activity of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T-cells in oral squamous cell carcinoma In order to evaluate host immune response to cancer, many methods have been applied. However, in the field of oral squamous cell carcinoma, evaluation of host immune response on the basis of proliferative activity of tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TIL) has not been reported. Therefore, we applied double immunohistochemical staining of proliferation markers Ki-67 and CD8 to surgically resected and paraffin-embedded tissue sections for 35 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma. With this method, there was a significant correlation between the percentage of Ki-67+CD8+TIL and the intra-tumor epithelium infiltration rate of CD8+TIL (P=0.0237). In the process of analysis, we found that the proliferative activity of CD8+TIL tended to correlate (P=0.0859) with clinical N factor (lymph node metastasis), which was previously reported to suppress host immune response. We therefore assumed there was another factor inducing host immune response. The proliferative activity of CD8+TIL was well correlated with preoperative radiotherapy (P=0.0200) while there was no significant correlation between the proliferative activity of CD8+TIL and other clinical factors; age, tumor size, clinical stage, pathological N factor (P=0.5410, 0.7769, 0.1041, and 0.1072, respectively). Our present results strongly imply that preoperative radiotherapy is a very important factor in oral squamous cell carcinoma inducing host immune response regardless of the clinical factors present.",Excluded,0.5631631
415,"Dosimetric Correlate of Cardiac-Specific Survival Among Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Stenting After Thoracic Radiotherapy for Cancer OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively evaluate outcomes among cancer survivors previously treated with thoracic radiotherapy (RT) who later underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)., METHODS: From 1998 to 2012, 76 patients first received curative RT (>30 Gy, except for Hodgkin lymphoma patients) involving the heart and lungs followed by PCI. Heart and lung-specific dosimetric parameters were correlated with overall survival (OS) and cardiac-specific survival by Cox variate methods., RESULTS: The mean interval between cancer diagnosis and PCI was 3.7 years (range, 0.1 to 12.6 y). Median follow-up since cancer diagnosis was 5.5 years. At analysis, 46 patients (61%) were alive, 5 (7%) died of cardiac causes, and 9 (12%) of cancer. Higher maximum RT heart dose was related to poorer OS since PCI (P=0.009). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (P=0.005) and higher mean heart dose (P<0.001) were related to poorer OS since cancer diagnosis. beta-Blockers, higher mean heart dose (hazard ratio [HR]=1.49, P<0.001), and percentage of targeted volume or organ receiving >=40 Gy for heart doses (HR=1.32, P<0.001) were associated with poorer non-cancer-specific survival since cancer diagnosis. Diabetes (HR=3.84, P=0.008) and increased percentage of targeted volume or organ receiving >=45 Gy (HR=1.01 per additional 100 cm irradiated, P=0.01) for the heart decreased major adverse cardiac event-free survival., CONCLUSIONS: Prior heart and lung-directed RT had volume-dependent and dose-dependent adverse effects on long-term cardiac outcomes for patients subsequently treated with PCI. RT planning that minimizes heart and lung irradiation doses should be encouraged.",Excluded,0.54950607

Captive breeding programs have generated data on the breeding behavior and ecology of G radiata; however, hematologic and biochemical data also are critically important in managing populations. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this study was to evaluate sex and seasonal effects on hematologic and biochemical data from captive radiated tortoises. METHOD(S): Whole blood was collected in January and August 2001 from 18 radiated tortoises (10 male, 8 female) housed at the Wildlife Survival Center on St Catherines Island, Georgia, as part of a routine health assessment. Routine hematologic and plasma biochemical analyses and electrophoresis were done using standard methods. Data from male and female tortoises were compared within and between seasons using 2-way ANOVA. RESULT(S): RBC and HCT values were significantly higher in summer than in winter and were higher in males than in females. Total protein concentration did not differ significantly between males and females; however, female tortoises had significantly higher concentrations of alpha1- and beta-globulins in winter and summer compared to males. Male tortoises had significantly higher sodium and uric acid concentrations and LDH activity during winter, and higher urea concentration and LDH and CK activities in summer, compared with females. Female tortoises had significantly higher triglyceride and phosphorus concentrations in winter, and higher phosphorus, cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations in summer, compared with males. CONCLUSION(S): Sex and seasonal differences in hematologic and biochemical values for radiated tortoises likely reflect vitellogenesis and egg production in females, and altered hydration status and activity in summer. Data from the tortoises in this study will be useful for the seasonal health assessment of this species.",Excluded,0.5342412

211,"Osteosarcoma of the flat bone Objective: We aimed to understand the biology of osteosarcoma of the flat bone, which is a rare tumor entity. Method(s): Cases with osteosarcoma of the flat bone were compared with those of the extremity in order to evaluate their clinicopathologic characteristics. And the influences of heterogeneous treatment modalities on outcome were analyzed. Result(s): Tumors of the flat bone comprised 91 (11.3%) of 806 osteosarcoma cases. Eight cases were secondary osteosarcoma associated with previous radiotherapy. Patients with a flat bone tumor were significantly older and more likely to present with metastases at diagnosis than extremity tumor. The proportions of female sex and chondroblastic subtype were higher among flat bone tumors than among extremity tumors. The 5-year overall survival and event-free survival rates were 35.2 +/- 5.4% and 24.7 +/- 5.5%, respectively. Although age and histologic response to pre-operative chemotherapy were not related to outcome of flat bone tumors, treatment modality influenced the survival. Patients treated surgically had better outcomes than those treated by another means. Radiation therapy did not appear to be an effective local control measure as surgery. Conclusion(s): Treatment outcome of the tumor of the flat bone was worse than extremity tumors. Further studies are needed to identify effective local control measures that can substitute for surgery and to determine the biologic characteristics of osteosarcoma of the flat bone. © The Author (2009).

We evaluated the relationship between heart dose parameters and sST-2 changes in chest malignant tumor patients who received chest radiation. Method(s): We prospectively collected thoracic malignancy cancer patients who had received chest radiotherapy. Heart dosimetry parameters were extracted from the treatment planning system. sST-2 was measured at baseline, the middle stage, and after radiotherapy (recorded as pre-ST-2, mid-ST-2, and post-ST-2). sST-2 change rate was calculated. Scatter plots showed the relationship between cardiac dose parameters and ST-2 change rate. Multiple regression was used to analyze the relationship between cardiac dose parameters and ST-2 change rate. Result(s): Totally, 60 patients were enrolled.

Of seventy-two respondents contacted, 61 (84.7%) completed the questionnaire. Twenty-eight, (45.9%) were younger than 45 years. Thirty-seven, (60.6%) had less than 10 years of experience in the laboratory. Only 28 (45.9%) had undertaken radiation protection training. Fifty-eight, (95.1%) consistently used lead aprons. Forty-seven, (77%) reported consistently using thyroid shields. Ten (16.4%) consistently used radiation protection eyeglasses, whilst 36 (59%) never used them. Thermoluminescent Dosimeter badges were consistently used in 23 (37.7%). Forty-two, (68.9%) reported having ceiling mounted lead/acrylic shields. Level of radiation exposure in the most recent one year was <=2 mSv in 14, between 2 and 20 mSv in 8 and between 20 and 30 mSv in 2, whilst 33 did not know their dose readings. The use of basic radiation protection tools as well as the knowledge and measurement of radiation exposure among interventional cardiologists working in Africa is low. The unavailability of some of the protective tools and a knowledge gap in terms of radiation protection and monitoring of self-exposure were some of the reasons for suboptimal self-protection against ionising radiation among our respondents.

652,"Models to study gravitational biology of Mammalian reproduction Mammalian reproduction evolved within Earth's 1-g gravitational field. As we move closer to the reality of space habitation, there is growing scientific interest in how different gravitational states influence reproduction in mammals. Habitation of space and extended spaceflight missions require prolonged exposure to decreased gravity (hypogravity, i.e., weightlessness). Lift-off and re-entry of the spacecraft are associated with exposure to increased gravity (hypergravity). Existing data suggest that spaceflight is associated with a constellation of changes in reproductive physiology and function. However, limited spaceflight opportunities and confounding effects of various nongravitational factors associated with spaceflight (i.e., radiation, stress) have led to the development of ground-based models for studying the effects of altered gravity on biological systems. Human bed rest and rodent hindlimb unloading paradigms are used to study exposure to hypogravity. Centrifugation is used to study hypergravity. Here, we review the results of spaceflight and ground-based models of altered gravity on reproductive physiology. Studies utilizing ground-based models that simulate hyper- and hypogravity have produced reproductive results similar to those obtained from spaceflight and are contributing new information on biological responses across the gravity continuum, thereby confirming the appropriateness of these models for studying reproductive responses to altered gravity and the underlying mechanisms of these responses. Together, these unique tools are yielding new insights into the gravitational biology of reproduction in mammals.",Excluded,0.51547307
