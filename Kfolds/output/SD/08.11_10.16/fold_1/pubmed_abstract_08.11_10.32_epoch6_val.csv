0,1233,"Self-generated lower body negative pressure exercise Background: Exercise during spaceflight helps prevent musculoskeletal and cardiovascular deconditioning to Earth gravity. This report evaluates the aerobic and anaerobic exercise stimulus provided by self-generated lower body negative pressure. Method(s): A lower body negative pressure cylinder expands and collapses longitudinally, but not radially. As the legs push footward to expand the cylinder, the air pressure in the cylinder decreases, increasing the force required to continue expanding the cylinder. In addition, valves control air flow into and out of the cylinder, and thus workload. In seven supine subjects, knee bend exercise was performed at 19 cycles per minute for 6 min. Footward force was measured with load cells, cylinder pressure with a transducer, heart rate from ECG, and oxygen consumption with turbine volumetry and gas analysis. Result(s): Maximum footward force at the peak of the exercise cycle averaged 1120 +/- 88 N (114 +/- 9 kg), and pressure within the cylinder concomitantly decreased 26 +/- 3 mmHg below ambient. Heart rate and oxygen consumption increased 75 +/- 4 bpm and 26.3 +/- 1.4 m O2/kg . min-1 from supine resting values, respectively. Conclusion(s): With the air inlet valve nearly closed, exercise with this device approximates a resistance-type leg press. With more inflow of air, more rapid, aerobic knee bends can be performed. This exercise device/concept provides simultaneous dynamic musculoskeletal and cardiovascular stresses without an external power source.",Excluded,0.1716122
1,1234,"Electronic brachytherapy for superficial and nodular basal cell carcinoma: A report of two prospective pilot trials using different doses Purpose: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a very common cancer in the Caucasian population. Treatment aims to eradicate the tumor with the lowest possible functional and aesthetic impact. Electronic brachytherapy (EBT) is a treatment technique currently emerging. This study aims to show the outcomes of two consecutive prospective pilot clinical trials using different radiation doses of EBT with Esteya EB system for the treatment of superficial and nodular basal cell carcinoma. Material(s) and Method(s): Two prospective, single-center, non-randomized, pilot studies were conducted. Twenty patients were treated in each study with different doses. The first group (1) was treated with 36.6 Gy in 6 fractions of 6.1 Gy, and the second group (2) with 42 Gy in 6 fractions of 7 Gy. Cure rate, acute toxicity, and late toxicity related to cosmesis were analyzed in the two treatment groups. Result(s): In group 1, a complete response in 90% of cases was observed at the first year of follow-up, whereas in group 2, the complete response was 95%. The differences with reference to acute toxicity and the cosmetic results between the two treatment groups were not statistically significant. Conclusion(s): Our initial experience with Esteya EB system to treat superficial and nodular BCC shows that a dose of 36.6 Gy and 42 Gy delivered in 6 fraction of 7 Gy achieves a 90% and 95% clinical cure rate at 1 year, respectively. Both groups had a tolerable toxicity and a very good cosmesis. The role of EBT in the treatment of BCC is still to be defined. It will probably become an established option for selected patients in the near future.Copyright © 2016, Termedia Publishing House Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.17931509
3,1236,"Light panretinal photocoagulation (LPRP) versus classic panretinal photocoagulation (CPRP) in proliferative diabetic retinopathy PURPOSE: We misled to verify whether a panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) performed using low levels of ARGON laser energy (light PRP) has the same efficacy as a PRP performed in a conventional fashion using argon green wavelengths (classic PRP) in eyes with high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy (HRPDR). Furthermore, we misled to compare the session number performed and the side effects produced by the two techniques., METHODS: Sixty-five eyes with HRPDR of 50 consecutive patients were enrolled in a prospective randomized controlled trial. In eyes selected for light PRP, a very light biomicroscopic effect on the retina was obtained for each spot. In eyes assigned to classic PRP, each spot produced a white-yellow biomicroscopic effect. Mean follow-up was 22.4 months +/- 9.7 in the light PRP and 21.6 months +/- 9.3 in the classic PRP group (p = 0.727)., RESULTS: The initial mean logMAR visual acuity (VA) in the light PRP group was 0.12 +/- 0.13 and in the classic PRP group 0.14 +/- 0.15 (p = 0.493). The final mean VA in the former was 0.18 +/- 0.25, and in the latter 0.27 +/- 0.30 (p = 0.231). Median power was 235mW (100-540mW) for light and 420mW (200-950mW) for classic PRP (p < 0.001). Regression of HRPDR at the end of the follow-up was obtained in 30/31 eyes (97%) treated with classic PRP and in 31/34 eyes (91%) treated with light PRP (p = 0.615). The total mean session number was 7.4 +/- 2.4 for light and 9.9 +/- 2.2 for the classic PRP group (p < 0.001). Complications were more frequent in the classic PRP group., CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of Light PRP is similar to that of classic Light PRP in eyes with HRPDR. Light PRP is associated with fewer complications and allows the reduction of the number of treatment sessions.",Excluded,0.17356694

7,1240,"Characterization of neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius pars centralis Esophageal sensory afferent inputs terminate principally in the central subnucleus of the tractus solitarius (cNTS). Neurons of the cNTS comprise two major neurochemical subpopulations. One contains neurons that are nitric oxide synthase (NOS) immunoreactive (-IR) while the other comprises neurons that are tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-IR. We have shown recently that TH-IR neurons are involved in esophageal-distention induced gastric relaxation. We used whole cell patch clamp techniques in rat brainstem slices combined with immunohistochemical and morphological reconstructions to characterize cNTS neurons. Postrecording reconstruction of cNTS neurons revealed two morphological neuronal subtypes; one group of cells (41 out of 131 neurons, i.e., 31%) had a multipolar soma, while the other group (87 out of 131 neurons, i.e., 66%) had a bipolar soma. Of the 43 cells in which we conducted a neurochemical examination, 15 displayed TH-IR (9 with bipolar morphology, 6 with multipolar morphology) while the remaining 28 neurons did not display TH-IR (18 with bipolar morphology, 10 with multipolar morphology). Even though the range of electrophysiological properties varied significantly, morphological or neurochemical distinctions did not reveal characteristics peculiar to the subgroups. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) recorded in cNTS neurons had a frequency of 1.5 +/- 0.15 events s(-1) and an amplitude of 27 +/- 1.2 pA (Vh = -50 mV) and were abolished by pretreatment with 30 muM AP-5 and 10 muM CNQX, indicating the involvement of both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors. Some cNTS neurons also received a GABAergic input that was abolished by perfusion with 30-50 muM bicuculline. In conclusion, our data show that despite the heterogeneity of morphological and neurochemical membrane properties, the electrophysiological characteristics of cNTS neurons are not a distinguishing feature.",Excluded,0.19456957
11,1246,"Residential radon and lung cancer: a cohort study in Galicia, Spain Case-control studies show an association between residential radon and lung cancer. The aim of this paper is to investigate this association through a cohort study. We designed an ambispective cohort study using the Galician radon map, Spain, with controls drawn from a previous case-control study. Subjects were recruited between 2002 and 2009. The data were cross-checked to ascertain lung cancer incidence and then analysed using a Cox regression model. A total of 2,127 subjects participated; 24 lung cancer cases were identified; 76.6% of subjects were drawn from the radon map. The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.2 (95%CI: 0.5-2.8) for the category of subjects exposed to 50Bq/m3 or more. This risk rose when subjects from the case-control study were analyzed separately. In conclusion, we did not observe any statistically significant association between residential radon exposure and lung cancer; however, it appears that with a sample of greater median age (such as participants from the case-control study), the risk of lung cancer would have been higher.",Excluded,0.67420864

17,1252,"Late radiation-associated dysphagia (late-RAD) with lower cranial neuropathy after oropharyngeal radiotherapy: A preliminary dosimetric comparison Background and objectives Late radiation-associated dysphagia (late-RAD) is a rare delayed toxicity, in oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) survivors. Prevention of late-RAD is paramount because the functional impairment can be profound and refractory to standard therapies. The objective of this analysis is to identify candidate dosimetric predictors of late-RAD and associated lower cranial neuropathies after radiotherapy (RT) or chemo-RT (CRT) for OPC. Materials and methods An unmatched retrospective case-control analysis was conducted. Late-RAD cases were identified among OPC patients treated with definitive RT or CRT. Controls were selected with minimum of 6 years without symptoms of late-RAD. Dysphagia-aspiration related structures (DARS) and regions of interest containing cranial nerve paths (RCCNPs) were retrospectively contoured. Dose volume histograms were calculated. Non-parametric bivariate associations were analyzed with Bonferroni correction and multiple logistic regression models were fit. Results Thirty-eight patients were included (12 late-RAD cases, 26 controls). Median latency to late-RAD was 5.8 years (range: 4.5-11.3 years). Lower cranial neuropathies were present in 10 of 12 late-RAD cases. Mean superior pharyngeal constrictor (SPC) dose was higher in cases relative to controls (median: 70.5 vs. 61.6 Gy). Mean SPC dose significantly predicted late-RAD (p = 0.036) and related cranial neuropathies (p = 0.019). RCCNPs did not significantly predict late-RAD or cranial neuropathies. Conclusions SPC dose may predict for late-RAD and related lower cranial neuropathies. These data, and those of previous studies that have associated SPC dose with classical dysphagia endpoints, suggest impetus to constrain dose to the SPCs when possible. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

19,1254,"Ability of a chest X-ray and an abdominal computed tomography scan to identify traumatic thoracic injury OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to show that a chest X-ray (CXR) and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan are sufficient to identify most clinically significant thoracic injuries in trauma patients, rendering the thoracic CT scan useful in only a subset of patients., METHODS: A retrospective study identified thoracic injuries in 374 trauma patients evaluated with a CXR, a thoracic CT scan, and an abdominal CT scan. Injuries seen on the initial CXR versus those seen on a CT scan only (occult) were identified and assessed for clinical relevance., RESULTS: An abdominal CT scan identified 65% (15/23) of occult pneumothoraces, 100% (25/25) of occult hemothoraces, 64% (18/28) of occult pulmonary contusions, and 58% (18/31) of occult rib fractures. No occult pneumothoraces seen on the thoracic CT scan alone required tube thoracostomy., CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study suggests that a CXR and an abdominal CT scan will identify most occult intrathoracic injuries. Reserving a thoracic CT scan for patients with an abnormal CXR or high-risk mechanism could safely reduce cost and radiation exposure while still diagnosing significant thoracic injuries.

20,1256,"Contrast-enhanced ultrasound for the evaluation of the cryolesion after laparoscopic renal cryoablation: An initial report Purpose: Stringent radiological follow-up is essential after renal tumor ablation. Drawbacks of postablation follow-up by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) are the associated ionizing radiation and nephrotoxic contrast agent. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has shown potential to demonstrate microvasculature without using either ionizing radiation or toxic contrast agent. We assessed the concordance of enhancement patterns of CEUS and CECT/MRI in cryolesion assessment after laparoscopic renal cryoablation (LCA). Method(s): From 01/2006 to 01/2009, a CEUS was performed before and after LCA (3 and 12 months) in addition to regular CECT/MRI. Using an enhancement score (0=no enhancement, 1=rim enhancement, 2=diffuse enhancement, 3=localized enhancement, 4=no enhancement defect), the cryolesion was assessed by both modalities, and concordance of enhancement score was assessed. Result(s): In total, 45 tumors were included (29 biopsy proven renal cell carcinoma (RCC), mean size 2.66 cm). One cryoablation failed, resulting in a nonenhancing cryolesion apart from the persisting renal tumor. There were no postablation recurrences during the study period. Pre-LCA: Both modalities were available in 26 cases. In 20 out of 26, there was concordance of enhancement score (77%, all cases score 3 or 4). Three months: Both modalities were available in 32 cases. Enhancement score corresponded in 23 out of 32 cases (72%). Seven cases showed enhancement on CECT/MRI (""1"" in six cases, ""4"" in one case) with enhancement score ""0""on CEUS. Two cases showed enhancement on CEUS without enhancement on CECT/MRI (specificity 92%, negative predictive value [NPV] 77%). Except one case, all enhancement resolved on subsequent imaging. Twelve months: Both modalities were available in 21 tumors. Enhancement score corresponded in 19 out of 21 cases (91%). Two cases showed enhancement on CEUS without enhancement on CECT/MRI (specificity 90%, NPV 100%). Conclusion(s): This pilot study shows that CEUS is a safe imaging technique with high concordance of enhancement score between CEUS and CECT/MRI. While cross-sectional imaging seems sensible to demonstrate successful ablation at first follow-up, CEUS might be used to diminish the burden of contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging in the long-term follow-up. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded,0.17089866

The purpose of this study was to examine predisposing factors at our institution. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 94 consecutive patients undergoing total laryngectomy. Cases with hypopharyngeal primary tumors or undergoing extended hypopharyngeal resection with flap augmentation of the pharynx were excluded. Results Seventy-four cases met inclusion criteria. A total of 25.7% patients developed a pharyngocutaneous fistula. The fistula rate was higher after salvage laryngectomy than after primary surgery (34.0% vs 11.1%; p =.05). Among salvage laryngectomies, performance of laryngectomy within 1 year of completion of radiotherapy (p =.006) and performance of concomitant bilateral neck dissection (p =.02) were significant risk factors for development of a fistula. Radiation dose, addition of chemotherapy, use of pectoralis major myofascial flap, preoperative tracheostomy, primary puncture, primary tumor subsite, and initial T classification were not significant.

Thus, we aimed to evaluate the intraoperative parameters, effectiveness and complications of patients undergoing PCNL between the endoscopic-guided prone split-leg PCNL (ePSL) and the supine PCNL by stratifying patients according to Guy's stone score (GSS)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients undergoing PCNL at two high-volume tertiary referral centers. At one center, patients underwent PCNL using the ePSL technique, while at the second center, patients underwent PCNL in supine. Patient demographics and stone characteristics, operative details, complications and effectiveness were compared between groups. The impact of obesity was also investigated., RESULTS: Of 830 subjects, a total of 449 (54%) underwent PCNL in ePSL and 381 (46%) in supine. The ePSL group had a greater mean age and body mass index. No statistical differences were found in gender, serum chemistry and Charlson comorbidity index. After stratifying patients by GSS, the differences in baseline stone burden between PSL and supine lost significance and both groups could be compared. Complications were not statistically different between both groups. Univariate analysis demonstrated that multiple tracts and lower pole access were more prevalent in supine. In addition, for GSS1-3, ePSL was correlated with reduced operative time, radiation exposure, length of hospital stay and need for secondary procedure. Multivariate analysis correlated ePSL with lower radiation exposure and need for secondary procedures (p = 0.01). In comparison to the whole trial population, the same tendencies were appreciated for obese cohort., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report focusing on the performance differences between ePSL and supine PCNL stratified by GSS. Both techniques are safe, with a low rate of complications. For GSS1-3, ePSL reduces radiation exposure and requires less need for both multiple access and secondary procedure.",Excluded,0.17117701

29,1267,"Differential recruitment of caspase 8 to cFlip confers sensitivity or resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis in a subset of familial lymphoma patients Resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis (FMA) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hematologic malignancies. Recently, a collaborative study showed that germline Fas mutations represent a genetic risk factor for the development of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Here, we report that transformed B cell lines from familial lymphoma patients show a range of sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis with lymphocytes from two patients with a marked resistance to Fas-, but not p53-mediated cell death. Fas resistance in these cells was associated with reduced recruitment of the initiator caspase 8 compared to cFlip, an inhibitor of apoptosis, to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). A decreased ratio of caspase 8 to cFlip in total cell extracts as well as in the DISC was associated with a profound disturbance of the Fas signaling cascade. We propose here that the relative reduction in caspase 8 to cFlip in the Fas DISC confers a survival advantage to lymphocytes and predisposes to the development of malignancy in some familial lymphoma patients.",Excluded,0.22177136

Two hundred patients with heart rates of 65 beats/min or less were enrolled; 100 underwent dual-source and 100 underwent 64-section CT coronary angiography. Two blinded observers independently assessed image quality of all coronary segments by using a four-point scale and searched for significant (>50%) stenoses in each segment. Catheter angiography was used as the reference standard. Image noise was measured in the ascending aorta. Radiation doses were calculated., RESULTS: No significant differences were found regarding sex, age, body weight, cardiovascular risk profile, prevalence of stenosis, mean and variability of heart rate, Agatston score, and image noise (all P > .1) between patients in both CT coronary angiography groups. No significant difference was found in the rate of nonassessable coronary segments between dual-source (1.0%, 14 of 1405) and 64-section CT coronary angiography (1.8%, 25 of 1387; P = .08). Motion artifacts occurred significantly more often in 64-section (21 of 25) versus dual-source (five of 14, P = .004) CT coronary angiography. Segment-based accuracy and specificity were significantly higher for dual-source versus 64-section CT coronary angiography. There was no significant difference in accuracy parameters at the per-vessel and per-patient analyses. No significant difference (P = .13) was found between the effective doses of dual-source (mean +/- standard deviation, 10.9 mSv +/- 1.1) and 64-section CT (10.4 mSv +/- 1.7) coronary angiography., CONCLUSION: In patients with heart rates of 65 beats/min or less, the higher temporal resolution of dual-source CT coronary angiography results in improved accuracy and specificity for the diagnosis of significant stenoses on a per-segment level at a similar radiation dose, but provides a comparable diagnostic accuracy on a patient-based level as does 64-section coronary angiography.",Excluded,0.17186718

41,1279,"Does Vacuum-assisted Closure Reduce the Risk of Wound Complications in Patients With Lower Extremity Sarcomas Treated With Preoperative Radiation? BACKGROUND: Although preoperative radiation followed by wide local excision yields excellent local control in soft tissue sarcomas, the risk of wound complications is reported to be higher compared with the incidence in patients who were administered postoperative radiation therapy. Vacuum (vac)-assisted closure may improve wound healing, but it is unknown whether vac-assisted closure during soft tissue sarcoma resection may reduce the risk of wound complications or impair local disease control., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does the use of a wound vac application at the time of soft tissue sarcoma resection reduce the risk of developing wound complications after lower extremity sarcoma resection? (2) Is vac-assisted closure associated with an increased risk of local relapse?, METHODS: From 2000 to 2016, 312 patients with stage I to III soft tissue sarcomas were treated. Of these, 123 were treated with preoperative radiation +/- chemotherapy followed by limb-sparing resection based on tumor location, size, grade, histology, and patient age. There was a minimum followup of 12 months. Radiation was delivered generally based on tumor size, grade, superficial versus deep nature, and proximity to neurovascular structures. Chemotherapy was administered in patients < 70 years old with high-grade tumors and tumors > 5 cm. Patient, demographic, and treatment variables, including incisional vac application and wound outcomes, were retrospectively evaluated. Incisional vac-assisted closure took place at the time of primary resection in 32% (46 of 123) of patients. Vac-assisted closure was considered when there was a concern for risk of external contamination such as instances in which fixation of adhesives would be difficult or regions where there was a high risk of contamination. Vac-assisted closure may have also been used in instances with increased wound tension at closure or with heightened concern for shearing on the wound such as buttock wounds. Ten patients were lost to followup, two in the vac group and eight in the non-vac group. Potential factors associated with wound complications were evaluated using Fisher's exact test for univariate analysis and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. Local recurrence-free survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate., RESULTS: After taking into consideration factors such as tumor size, location, age, and patient comorbidities, it was shown that patients who underwent vac-assisted closure were less likely to experience wound complications compared with patients who did not undergo vac-assisted closure (odds ratio, 0.129; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.041-0.398; p = 0.004). The local control incidence in the entire cohort was 98%. With the numbers available, Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from local recurrence did not differ between patients treated with or without the vac (100% [95% CI, 154.09-154.09] versus 96% [95% CI, 152.21-169.16]; p = 0.211), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Vac-assisted closure at the time of resection of proximal lower extremity soft tissue sarcomas is associated with a lower risk of wound complications, and its use apparently did not compromise local control. We show that the use of vac-assisted closure may be worth considering in surgeons' attempts to reduce the risk of wound complications among patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the proximal lower extremities., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.",Included,0.17438908

Method(s): In this study, we comprised adults with ventriculoperitoneal shunt operations who underwent early CT scans within 48 hours postoperatively. We reviewed the correlation between revision surgery rate and the experience of surgeons who performed surgery and provided a cost analysis. Result(s): In total, 479 surgeries were performed in 439 patients. Early revision surgery was performed in 11 (2.3%) patients. Reason for revision surgery was malposition in 9 cases and intracerebral hemorrhage in 2 patients. There was no significant correlation between the surgeon's experience and the rate of revision surgery. Placement of the ventricular catheter via an approach other than a standard right or left frontal burr hole resulted in risk of need for surgical shunt revision (P >= 0.002, odds ratio 54, confidence interval 13.5-223). A total of 468 CT scans of the head revealed a normal finding; thus, ~$562,000 could be saved by omitting postoperative head CT scans. Conclusion(s): Routine postoperative head CT scans after fentriculoperitoneal shunting are not necessary in all cases. The reduction of exposure to ionization radiation and the beneficial economic factor are main advantages.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.17190985
49,1287,"Thyroid radiation doses during radioimmunotherapy of CEA-expressing tumours with 131I-labelled monoclonal antibodies A number of radioimmunotherapy (RAIT) trials with iodinated antibodies have shown a high variability in the radiation doses to the thyroid. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate which factors influence these thyroid doses during RAIT with 131iodinated monoclonal anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) antibodies. Data from 36 patients with CEA-expressing tumours were analysed. The patients underwent RAIT with the 131I-labelled IgG1 anti-CEA antibody, MN-14 (Ka = 10(9) l mol-1) or its F(ab')2 fragment (activity range 45.8-220.0 mCi). The thyroid was blocked with 120 mg iodine (lugol's orSSKI solution) and 400 mg perchlorate per day, starting 1 day prior to the first study. Blood clearance and molecular composition of labelled plasma compounds were determined by blood sampling and size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. The cumulated activities of tissues were determined from daily imaging and blood clearance data. Doses were derived from the MIRD scheme. Thyroid radiation doses showed a high variability, between 1.2 and 37.7 cGy mCi-1 (mean +/- S.D.: 11.1 +/- 8.3 cGy mCi-1), corresponding to absolute doses between 2.5 and 43.6 Gy. However, the maximal iodine uptake in the thyroid was 2.4 +/- 1.9 microCi mCi-1 (range 0.2-10.0 microCi mCi-1), which was less than 1% of the injected activity, indicating that more than 99% of the thyroid was blocked in all cases. No correlation was found between these thyroid doses and conditions leading to an enhanced exposure to free radioiodine, such as unbound I- in the mAb preparation, rapid metabolic breakdown of the labelled antibody due to human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA), or immune complex formation with circulating antigen. However, a relationship between the thyroid doses and the patients' compliance in taking their Lugol's and perchlorate blocking medications, as well as to a relatively high variability in the biological half-life of the iodine in the thyroid (range from 31.1 h to virtual infinity), is indicated. No rising TSH titres or other signs of (latent) hypothyroidism were seen in these patients during a 2 year follow-up period. Longer follow-up was not possible because of the terminal condition of most of the patients. These data show that thyroid doses in an appropriately blocked individual given a standard, non-myeloablative dose of RAIT, are generally lower than those assumed to be required to cause late hypothyroidism. Even if higher activities are used, potential hypothyroidism may be overcome easily by hormone replacement. Thyroid doses are independent of parameters leading to an enhanced exposure of the thyroid to free radioiodine, suggesting that patient compliance in taking their blocking medication may be the most crucial factor for reducing thyroid doses in RAIT with 131I-labelled antibodies.",Excluded,0.18053193
52,1290,"Monitoring of residual hematopoiesis after total body irradiation in humans as a model for accidental x-ray exposure: dose-effect and failure of ex vivo expansion of residual stem cells in view of autografting PURPOSE: To evaluate the residual hematopoiesis at different levels of total body irradiation (TBI) dose in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB), and to study the dose-effect relationship on hematopoietic immature and mature progenitors. We also investigated the possibility of expanding ex vivo the residual progenitors exposed to different dose levels of TBI., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight patients treated for AML (n = 3) and myeloma (n = 5) were included. BM and PB samples were harvested before TBI and after doses of: 5 Gy. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were assayed for burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), granulocyte-forming unit macrophage (CFU-GM), and long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-ICs). Ex vivo expansion: MNCs (after irradiation and controls) were suspended in long-term cultures and expanded with a combination of five cytokines., RESULTS: CD34+ cells were detectable at 10 Gy. We observed a significant decrease of CFU-GM and BFU-E, respectively, to 13.5% and 8.5% of baseline values for doses <or=2 Gy and to 8.2% and 4.6% for doses ranging between 2.1 and 5 Gy. No dose effect was observed for residual MNCs. LTC-ICs were not detectable after 0.8 Gy. The expansion was not successful after 1.2 Gy., CONCLUSION: This study confirms the significant decrease of human mature and immature progenitors in BM and PB immediately after low-dose TBI. In addition, the lack of expansion suggests that autografting using BM or PB residual stem cells collected and expanded in vitro in case of accidental whole body exposure may be impractical.",Excluded,0.93857867

57,1295,"Indocyanine Green Angiography Visualized by Augmented Reality in Aneurysm Surgery Objective: We prospectively investigated how to integrate indocyanine green (ICG) angiography in an augmented reality (AR) setting for aneurysm surgery. Method(s): In 20 patients with a total of 22 aneurysms, the head-up display of the operating microscope (Kinevo900) was used for AR. ICG-AR was established directly by the head-up display superimposing the ICG angiography as green live video overlay. In addition, the reconstructed outline of the three-dimensional (3D) vessel architecture was visualized by AR applying intraoperative low-dose computed tomography (vessel-AR). Result(s): In all patients, ICG-AR and vessel-AR were successfully implemented. The flow in the vessels could be observed directly in the white light view of the microscope oculars without being distracted from the surgical site by looking on separate screens. This factor enabled also surgical manipulation during ICG angiography. In parallel, AR additionally visualized the 3D vessel architecture, enhancing the understanding of the 3D anatomy (target registration error, 0.71 +/- 0.21 mm; intraoperative low-dose computed tomography effective dose, 42.7 muSv). Linear (n = 28; range, 1-8.5 mm) and rotational (n = 3; range, 2.9degree-14.4degree) navigation adjustments performed in 18 of 20 patients resulted in a close matching of the vessel-AR outline with the real vessel situation after preparation, compensating for shifting. Conclusion(s): ICG-AR could be successfully implemented. It facilitated surgical manipulation and flow interpretation during ICG angiography because it could be observed directly while looking through the microscope oculars in white light instead of being distracted from the surgical site while looking on separate screens. Additional AR visualizing the vessel architecture improved understanding of 3D anatomy for preparation and clipping.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.17130794
60,1298,"Low-energy He/Ne laser in the prevention of radiation-induced mucositis: A multicenter phase III randomized study in patients with head and neck cancer Use of the low-energy helium-neon laser (LEL) appears to be a simple atraumatic technique for the prevention and treatment of mucositis of various origins. Preliminary findings, and significant results obtained for chemotherapy-induced mucositis in a previous phase III study, prompted a randomized multicenter double-blind trial to evaluate LEL in the prevention of acute radiation-induced stomatitis. Irradiation by LEL corresponds to local application of a high-photon-density monochromatic light source. Activation of epithelial healing for LEL-treated surfaces, the most commonly recognized effect, has been confirmed by numerous in vitro studies. The mechanism of action at a molecular and enzymatic level is presently being studied. From September 1994 to March 1998, 30 patients were randomized. Technical specification: 60 mW (25 mW at Reims, 1 patient), He-Ne, wavelength 632.8 nm. The trial was open to patients with carcinoma of the oropharynx, hypopharynx and oral cavity, treated by radiotherapy alone (65 Gy at a rate of 2 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions per week) without prior surgery or concomitant chemotherapy. The malignant tumor had to be located outside the tested laser application areas (9 points): posterior third of the internal surfaces of the cheeks, soft palate and anterior tonsillar pillars. Patients were randomized to LEL or placebo light treatment, starting on the first day of radiotherapy and before each session. The treatment time (t) for each application point was given by the equation: t (s)=energy (J/cm2) x surface (cm2)/Power (W). Objective assessment of the degree of mucositis was recorded weekly by a physician blinded to the type of treatment, using the WHO scale for grading of mucositis and a segmented visual analogue scale for pain evaluation. Protocol feasibility and compliance were excellent. Grade 3 mucositis occurred with a frequency of 35.2% without LEL and of 7.6% with LEL (P<0.01). The frequency of 'severe pain' (grade 3) was 23.8% without LEL, falling to 1.9% with LEL (P < 0.05). Pain relief was significantly reduced throughout the treatment period (weeks 2-7). LEL therapy is capable of reducing the severity and duration of oral mucositis associated with radiation therapy. In addition, there is a tremendous potential for using LEL in combined treatment protocols utilizing concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.17665881
61,1299,"Treatment and prognosis of stage I follicular lymphoma in the modern era-does PET matter? Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common subtype of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients with stage I disease are usually treated with radiotherapy (RT). In previous studies, mostly from the pre positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) era, the 5 year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of stage I disease were 60-80% and 80-93%, respectively. This study retrospectively evaluated the outcome of stage I FL which was treated with involved field RT in the PET-CT era between 2002 and 2015. Ninety-one patients were enrolled. Five year PFS and OS rates were 73% and 97%, respectively. Relapse occurred in 19 (21%) patients, 74% occurring outside the radiation field. In conclusion, PET-CT staging of clinical stage I FL may contribute to the improved prognosis in patients treated with RT compared to historical cohorts, possibly due to better identification of ""genuine"" stage I disease.Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded,0.17179044
62,1300,"Reduced ultraviolet-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in human skin with topical application of a photolyase-containing DNA repair enzyme cream: Clues to skin cancer prevention The exposure of human skin to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) results in the formation of DNA photolesions that give rise to photoaging, mutations, cell death and the onset of carcinogenic events. Photolyase (EC 4.1.99.3) is a DNA repair enzyme that reverses damage caused by exposure to UVR. We sought to investigate whether addition of photolyase enhances the protection provided by a traditional sunscreen (SS), by reducing the in vivo formation of cyclobutane-type pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and UVR-induced apoptosis in human skin. Ten volunteers (Fitzpatrick skin type II) were exposed to solar-simulated (ss) UVR at a three times minimal erythema dose for 4 consecutive days. Thirty minutes prior to each exposure, the test materials [vehicle, SS (sun protection factor 50) alone, and SS plus photolyase from Anacystis nidulans] were applied topically to three different sites. One additional site was left untreated and one received ssUVR only. Biopsy specimens were taken 72 h after the last irradiation. The amount of CPDs and the extent of apoptosis were measured by ELISA. Photolyase plus SS was superior to SS alone in reducing both the formation of CPDs and apoptotic cell death (both P<0.001). In conclusion, the addition of photolyase to a traditional SS contributes significantly to the prevention of UVR-induced DNA damage and apoptosis when applied topically to human skin.",Excluded,0.18029825

Material(s) and Method(s): This study investigated heart rate asymmetry (HRA) and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters with 1:2 and 1:1 metronomepaced inspiration/expiration ratios during short-term 1,800MHz GSM cellular phone exposure in 20 healthy volunteers. Result(s): Significant HRA changes by Porta and Guzik indices were not found on exposure compared to sham exposure. Time-domain HRV parameters on exposure showed significant differences at 1:1 paced, but not at 1:2 paced breathing compared to sham exposure. A mild post-exposure effect was observed regarding root mean square of successive RR-differences. Conclusion(s): The findings reflect persisting acute effects of GSM handset emission on the autonomic nervous system. Exploring its influences on health status and survival needs further studies.

65,1303,"Disc height and motion patterns in the lumbar spine in patients operated with total disc replacement or fusion for discogenic back pain. Results from a randomized controlled trial BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Fusion is considered the ""gold standard"" in surgical treatment of degenerated disc disease; the intended postoperative goal is absence of mobility, but treatment may induce degeneration in adjacent segments. Total disc replacement (TDR) aims to restore and maintain mobility by replacing a painful disc. Little is known about the degree and quality of mobility in artificial discs in vivo and whether maintained mobility reduces the stress on adjacent segments that is believed to occur after fusion. PURPOSE: To see if surgical goals for respective treatments had been reached, if clinical outcome was related to this, and if differences in disc height at treated segments and adjacent segment motion patterns between groups occurred. STUDY DESIGN: Comparison of X-ray measurements in a randomized controlled trial between instrumented posterior fusion and TDR for chronic low back pain (CLBP) assumed to be discogenic. Results were compared with clinical outcome. PATIENT SAMPLE: The material consisted of 152 patients suffering from CLBP assumed to be discogenic. Seventy-two patients were treated with fusion and 80 with TDR. OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of X-ray measurements were compared between groups and related to self-reported clinical results regarding back pain and disability. METHOD(S): Flexion-extension X-rays were analyzed preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively using distortion-compensated Roentgen analysis (DCRA) at treated and adjacent levels, and mobility after fusion and TDR was estimated. Changes in disc height and range of motion (ROM) respective translation in adjacent segments were compared between groups. Results of DCRA measurements were also compared with the clinical outcome. RESULT(S): Preoperative flexion-extension ROM was similar between the fusion and TDR groups, and preoperative disc heights of segments to be treated were between one and two standard deviation less than that previously established in a normative database. Seventy percent of fused patients had no mobility, whereas 85% of TDR patients were mobile. Fulfillment of surgical goals was correlated to neither back pain nor disability. Fused segments were lower and TDR segments were higher than normative values postoperatively. There were also significant differences at adjacent segments, there being more translation and flexion-extension in the fusion group than in the TDR group. CONCLUSION(S): This very accurate X-ray method (DCRA) indicates that surgical goals were reached in most patients. This, however, was not correlated to clinical outcome. Differences between the groups in postoperative disc height at treated segments, respective ROM, and translation at adjacent segments did not affect the clinical outcome after 2 years. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

67,1305,"The effect of head-to-trunk position on the direction of arm movements before, during, and after space flight This contribution deals with the examination of the consequences of different head-to-trunk positions on arm movements under normal gravity and during prolonged space flight. One of the objectives of this study was to investigate the influence of weightlessness on the condition of the spatial analysis system. Aimed arm movements in the horizontal plane (pointings towards two visual targets) were recorded, first with eyes open, head straight (learning part), then with eyes closed, head straight and during yaw or roll position of the head (performance part). Measurements related to these different head-to-trunk-positions were taken in one short-term and nine long-term cosmonauts preflight, inflight, and postflight. Terrestrial control experiments were carried out with an extended experimental design in 14 healthy volunteers. The analysis of these experiments revealed that, with eyes closed and the head in yaw position, cosmonauts before flight and control subjects exhibit significant slants of the movement plane of the arm. Contrary to terrestrial measurements, in space experiments roll tilt of the head to the right is correlated with considerable counterclockwise slant of the movement plane. This slant of the movement plane of the arm was interpreted as tilt of the internal representation of the horizontal coordinate. The effect is larger with greater distortion induced by the changed head position and with larger muscular involvement to keep this position. This effect is also increased by the reduction of information (for example, in microgravity). The amount and the direction of the horizontal offset of the arm movements are shown to be dependent on the head-to-trunk position, too. Additionally, we have found changes in the amplitude and in the duration of the arm movement, in the vertical offset, and in the curvature of the movement paths, depending on the experimental conditions.",Excluded,0.18006086
70,1308,"Subacute haematotoxicity after PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTA-octreotate: prognostic factors, incidence and course PURPOSE: In peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), the bone marrow (BM) is one of the dose-limiting organs. The accepted dose limit for BM is 2 Gy, adopted from (131)I treatment. We investigated the incidence and duration of haematological toxicity and its risk factors in patients treated with PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTA(0)-Tyr(3)-octreotate ((177)Lu-DOTATATE). Also, absorbed BM dose estimates were evaluated and compared with the accepted 2 Gy dose limit., METHODS: The incidence and duration of grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity (according to CTCAE v3.0) and risk factors were analysed. Mean BM dose per unit (gigabecquerels) of administered radioactivity was calculated and the correlations between doses to the BM and haematological risk factors were determined., RESULTS: Haematological toxicity (grade 3/4) occurred in 34 (11 %) of 320 patients. In 15 of the 34 patients, this lasted more than 6 months or blood transfusions were required. Risk factors significantly associated with haematological toxicity were: poor renal function, white blood cell (WBC) count <4.0 x 10(9)/l, age over 70 years, extensive tumour mass and high tumour uptake on the OctreoScan. Previous chemotherapy was not associated. The mean BM dose per administered activity in 23 evaluable patients was 67 +/- 7 mGy/GBq, resulting in a mean BM dose of 2 Gy in patients who received four cycles of 7.4 GBq (177)Lu-DOTATATE. Significant correlations between (cumulative) BM dose and platelet and WBC counts were found in a selected group of patients., CONCLUSION: The incidence of subacute haematological toxicity after PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE is acceptable (11 %). Patients with impaired renal function, low WBC count, extensive tumour mass, high tumour uptake on the OctreoScan and/or advanced age are more likely to develop grade 3/4 haematological toxicity. The BM dose limit of 2 Gy, adopted from (131)I, seems not to be valid for PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE.",Excluded,0.1713263

The authors assessed agreement between medical x-ray histories obtained through interview and by review of medical records from thyroid cancer case-control studies conducted in Sweden (1985-1992; 123 cases and 123 controls) and from members of a prepaid health plan in the United States (1986-1991; 50 cases and 50 controls). In both studies, substantial disagreement was found between the numbers of x-ray examinations reported in the interview and in the medical records. There was an indication of relatively poorer reporting among controls, particularly for certain types of x-ray examinations and for large numbers of such examinations. Estimates of the risk associated with exposure to diagnostic x-rays were similar, regardless of whether interview or medical record data were used, even though ordinal dose classifications based on the two sources differed considerably. In populations with a high frequency of exposure, spurious associations with numbers of x-ray examinations or estimated thyroid dose might arise because of differences in recall.

To retrospectively evaluate the efficiency, in particular survival benefits, of radioembolisation in the treatment of liver metastases., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Over 5 years, 339 patients underwent (90) Y microsphere radioembolisation for unresectable liver metastases and were evaluated for adverse events at the time of treatment and 1 and 3 months after treatment. Overall survival (OS) was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The results from the present retrospective study were compared with a number of prospective and retrospective clinical trials which have addressed the use of (90) Y microspheres as a salvage treatment for liver metastases., RESULTS: The OS time of the present study (12.0 months) compares favourably with survival times reported by other groups. The incidence of late grade 2 adverse events (e.g. duodenal or gastric ulceration, radiation-induced liver disease, gall bladder complications) is comparable to previous studies, with a lower prevalence of grade 2/3 ulcerations (3.7%) at our centre., CONCLUSIONS: The survival results, together with the low acute and late toxicity observed in our data and previous studies, support the use of radioembolisation to aid in the local control of unresectable liver metastases in the salvage setting.

The vector is distributed all over the country but the disease is confined to particular zones since before the last century. In this study, parameters such as altitude, temperature, humidity, rainfall and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were investigated for correlation with the distribution of the disease in the northeastern corner of the Indian sub-continent. Data analysis on Kala-azar prevalence during the period 2005-2007 in the four states showed that the highest prevalence was below 150 m of altitude with very few cases located above the 300 m level. Low NDVI value ranges (0.03-0.015) correlated with a high occurrence of the disease. The maximum temperatures in the affected sites varied between an upper level of 25-29 degrees C and a minimum of 16-20 degrees C. The rainfall in these areas fluctuated between 1154 and 1834 mm.

Method(s): Seventy-eight patients were enrolled prospectively for 80 procedures (80 limbs) that were randomly divided into two groups: 40 in the single vessel (SV) group and 40 in the multiple vessel group (MV). All patients had tissue loss. The choice of the first artery to treat was based on an analysis of two factors: the ease of the required endovascular technique and the presence of adequate distal outflow. The randomisation point was after the first successful distal artery angioplasty. The primary endpoints were the wound healing rate and limb salvage. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 69.1 +/- 4.3 years, and 56% were male. Concomitant treatment of the femoral and popliteal arteries was performed in 38.8% of patients. All demographic characteristics and technical aspects were statistically comparable for both groups. Successful recanalisation was achieved in 95.8%, 86.2%, 86.9%, and 92.5% for the tibio-fibular trunk, anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and fibular artery, respectively. In the MV group, a higher contrast volume (29 mL more; p =.049), longer procedure time (p =.01), and higher radiation exposure (p =.04) were noted. There was no difference in renal function between the groups either before or 30 days after the procedure (p =.165). The limb salvage rates after 1 and 3 years, respectively, were 75.9% and 67% for the SV group and 91.1% and 91.1% for the MV group (log rank p =.052). The wound healing rates after 1 and 3 years, respectively, were 33.6% and 70.9% for the SV and 63.9% and 78.4% for MV group (log rank p =.006). Wound healing was faster in MV (2.11 cm2/month) than SV group (0.62 cm2/month; p =.004).

Using logistic regression, we evaluated racial differences in the probability of receiving standard chemoradiation. We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate associations between race, receipt of standard therapy and survival. Result(s): Our analysis included 19,835 patients. Patients receiving standard chemoradiation had better survival than patients receiving nonstandard therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.68; p < 0.001). Compared to White patients, Black patients were less likely to receive standard therapy (odds ratio [OR] 0.85; 95% CI 0.76-0.96; p < 0.008). We observed no statistical difference in mortality between Black and White patients overall (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.15; p = 0.24). However, for the subgroup of patients receiving nonstandard therapy, Black patients had an increased mortality risk compared to White patients (HR 1.17, CI 1.01-1.35; p = 0.034). We observed no survival differences in the subgroup of patients receiving standard treatment (HR 1.00, CI 0.90-1.11, p = 0.99). Conclusion(s): Standard treatment in anal SCC is associated with better survival, but Black patients are less likely to receive standard treatment than White patients. Although Black patients had higher mortality than White patients in the subgroup of patients receiving nonstandard therapy, this difference was ameliorated in the subset receiving standard therapy.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

90,1328,"Monochromatic excimer light (308 nm): an immunohistochemical study of cutaneous T cells and apoptosis-related molecules in psoriasis BACKGROUND: Various types of UVB radiation source (290-320 nm) are used in treating psoriasis and their therapeutic mechanism has been attributed to immunosuppressive properties. Recently, a new UVB source generated by a 308-nm excimer laser has been introduced for the treatment of psoriasis., OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the immunohistochemical evaluation of T cells and the expression of various apoptosis-related molecules in the psoriatic hyperproliferative skin before and after treatment with 308-nm monochromatic excimer light (MEL)., METHODS: Ten patients (three women and seven men), ranging in age from 29 to 79 years, affected by plaque-type psoriasis vulgaris, were treated with MEL. Biopsies from psoriatic lesions of MEL-treated sites were taken before, 24 h and/or 48 h after the first irradiation and analysed by the immunophosphatase alkaline technique (APAAP)., RESULTS: MEL treatment was found to cause a significant decrease in the rate of proliferation of keratinocytes and a relevant depletion of T cells in all psoriatic lesions, 48 h after the first irradiation: 308 nm light eliminated T cells from the psoriatic epidermis and also from the dermis, highlighting the ability of this UVB source to penetrate the skin compared with normal UVB and establish direct cytotoxic action on T cells infiltrating skin lesions. Rapid clearing of psoriatic lesions involves potential molecular targets of UVB in T cells including p53, which is upregulated after direct irradiation with 308-nm UVB. Moreover, Bcl-2 expression in healing psoriasis epidermis after MEL treatment is significantly decreased compared with untreated skin and the TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling) technique revealed the presence of relevant apoptotic keratinocytes in the irradiated epidermis., CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that psoriatic skin after monochromatic excimer light therapy is associated with significant T-cell depletion and alterations of apoptosis-related molecules accompanied by a decreased proliferation index and clinical remission.",Excluded,0.18000728

93,1331,"Using a three-dimensional computer assisted stone volume estimates to evaluate extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy treatment of kidney stones This study describes and evaluates the use of non-contrast enhanced computerized tomography (NCCT) before and after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL). Computer measured stone volume was used as an exact measurement for treatment response. 81 patients received SWL of kidney stones at Herlev Hospital between April 2013 and January 2014 and follow-up was possible in 77 (95 %) patients. NCCT was used before and after treatment. Treatment response was expressed as a reduction of the stone volume. Stone characteristics as the stone volumes, HU, SSD and localization were measured by radiologist using a vendor non-specific computer program. Complications, patient characteristics and additional treatment were registered. On average, 5858 shocks were given each patient. The follow-up NCCT was performed 24 days after treatment. It was possible to calculate the stone volume in 88 % of the patients-the remaining 12 % it was not possible due to stone disintegration. The stone free rate was 22 %. The average relative reduction in stone burden was 62 %. Only 8 % of the patients were radiological non-responders. Steinstrasse was observed in 13 (17 %) and 28 (36 %) patients had additional treatment performed. Irradiation dose per NCCT was 2.6 mSv. Stone volume could be calculated in most patients. The relative reduction in stone burden after treatment was 62 %. The stone volume was redundant when evaluating stone free patients, but in cases of partial response it gave an exact quantification, to be used in the further management and follow-up of the patients.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded,0.1711988

We retrospectively identified 28 patients with stage I-II PMBCL in our lymphoma database, re-reviewed pathology slides and scored interim or post-chemotherapy PET/CTs using the Deauville scale. Fourteen patients received RT (36-45 Gy) preceded by either six cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) or 12 weeks of rituximab, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and bleomycin (R-VACOP-B) with median follow-up of 94 months. Fourteen patients received 4-8 cycles of dose-adjusted etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) with median follow-up of 38 months; one of these received RT (36 Gy) due to post-chemotherapy PET/CT Deauville score 4.

99,1337,"Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma to manage seizures; preclinical studies suggest that it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT). We investigated whether VA use during RT for glioblastoma was associated with overall survival by retrospective multivariable analysis in a large cohort. The results suggest that HDAC inhibitors, like VA, may improve the results of RT and should be subjected to clinical trials. Purpose(s): Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (GB) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT). We investigated whether VA use during RT for GB was associated with overall survival (OS). Methods and Materials: Medical records of 544 adults with GB were retrospectively reviewed. Analyses were performed to determine the association of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis (RTOG RPA) class, seizure history, and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) and AED use during RT with OS. Result(s): Seizures before the end of RT were noted in 217 (40%) patients, and 403 (74%) were taking an AED during RT; 29 (7%) were taking VA. Median OS in patients taking VA was 16.9 months (vs 13.6 months taking another AED, P=.16). Among patients taking an AED during RT, OS was associated with VA (P=.047; hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-1.07), and RTOG RPA class (P<.0001; HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.37-1.61). Of the 5 most common AEDs, only VAwas associated with OS. Median OS of patients receiving VA and TMZ during RT was 23.9 months (vs 15.2 months for patients taking another AED, P=.26). When the analysis was restricted to patients who received concurrent TMZ, VA use was marginally associated with OS (P=.057; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, -0.09 to 1.17), independently of RTOG RPA class and seizure history. Conclusion(s): VA use during RT for GB was associated with improved OS, independently of RTOG RPA, seizure history, and concurrent TMZ use. Further studies of treatment that combines HDAC inhibitors and RT are warranted. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.17449276
100,1338,"Long-Term Outcomes for Patients With Desmoid Fibromatosis Treated With Radiation Therapy: A 10-Year Update and Re-evaluation of the Role of Radiation Therapy for Younger Patients Purpose: To update our experience with long-term outcomes in patients with desmoid fibromatosis treated with radiation therapy (RT) and to characterize factors associated with increased risk of local recurrence. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the records of 209 consecutive patients with desmoid fibromatosis treated with RT, either alone or as combined-modality therapy (CMT) with surgery, at our institution from 1965 to 2015. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 98 months (range, 1-509 months). The 5- and 10-year local control (LC) was 71% and 69%, respectively. Fifty-nine patients (28%) experienced a local recurrence at a median time of 23 months (interquartile range, 15-38 months). Among all patients, on multivariable analysis, adjusting for anatomic site, size, age, treatment era (>2005 vs <=2005), treatment approach (RT alone vs CMT), and an interaction between age and treatment, we found only age <=30 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.94; P =.005; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-6.27) and large tumor size >10 cm (HR, 2.51; P =.03; 95% CI, 1.09-5.78) to be correlated with poorer LC. Notably, for patients receiving RT alone, the 5-year LC was 43% for patients <=30 years old versus 75% for >30 years old (P <.001). On multivariable analyses, for patients receiving RT alone, the only factor associated with inferior LC was age <=30 years (HR, 2.87; P =.001; 95% CI, 1.51-5.47). The same was true for patients treated with CMT; age <=30 years was the only factor associated with inferior LC (HR, 5.36; P =.01; 95% CI, 1.40-20.58). Conclusion(s): Among all patients with desmoid fibromatosis, RT is an effective local therapy for tumor control. However, young patients <= 30 years have notably high rates of local recurrence regardless of treatment strategy, which requires further study. Treatment decisions should be risk-adapted by large referral centers with multidisciplinary expertise in desmoid management.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.18495877

107,1345,"Treatment of limited small cell lung cancer: An old or new challenge? Purpose of review: This review highlights how progress has been made in treating limited small cell lung cancer and outlines current challenges to overcome for improved cure rates. Recent findings: There is a rationale for the tumour, node, metastasis staging system to replace the current convention of limited versus extensive stage. Positron emission tomography may aid in staging but prospective validation in larger series of patients is needed. Cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy has yet to be superseded by either newer cytotoxic drugs or targeted agents. More progress has been made for radiotherapy but questions of optimal dose, schedule, timing and treatment volume remain unanswered. Summary: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is associated with a one in four chance of cure. Two ongoing phase III trials have been designed to address the optimal radiotherapy regimen to combine with cisplatin and etoposide. Close collaboration between radiation and medical oncologists is needed to make further progress and to improve patient access to curative intent concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimens. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded,0.17486946
111,1349,"Preclinical studies with the Faure high energy neutron facility: response of pig skin to fractionated doses of fast neutrons (66 MeVp----Be) The early and late responses of pig skin to fractionated doses of both unfiltered and filtered (i.e. hardened) neutrons using the Faure neutron therapy facility (66 MeVp----Be) were determined and compared with those following fractionated doses with 60Co gamma-rays. Dose-effect curves for the quantal responses of moist desquamation (early epithelial response) and dermal necrosis (late response) were fitted by probit analysis and ED50 values obtained. For a neutron fractionation scheme comprised of 12 fractions in 26 days, and using an unfiltered beam, the ED50 values for moist desquamation and dermal necrosis were 18.67 +/- 2.22 and 22.25 +/- 0.48 Gy, respectively, whereas in the case of the filtered beam, the corresponding ED50 values were 24.78 +/- 1.44 and 23.30 +/- 0.47 Gy. In order to provide a comparison, the values for 24 fractions of 60Co gamma-rays given in 39 days (a clinical protocol used in the Groote Schuur Hospital) were 74.02 +/- 2.92 and 66.72 +/- 1.93 Gy for moist desquamation and dermal necrosis, respectively. For the unfiltered beam, values for the comparative biological effectiveness (CBE) were 3.96 and 3.00 for the early and late skin response, respectively. The corresponding CBE values were for the filtered beam 2.99 and 2.86.

This practice has raised concerns due to potential high radiation exposure in terms of adequate benefit to risk profile. Design(s): Demographics and CTCA scan details were collected from a consecutive series of 586 patients referred to a single community radiology practice for a CTCA. Result(s): Of the 586 patients, 271 (46.2%) were women. Mean age was 58.3 standard deviation (SD) 12.2, range 15-90 years, body mass index (BMI) 28.6 SD 5.9 kg/m2, and heart rate 60 SD 10 beats per minute. Mean total radiation was 4.79 SD 3.45 mSv (range 0.64-31.34). The mean radiation exposure in the lowest quartile of BMI and heart rate were 3.01 SD 1.84 mSv and 3.95 SD 2.72 mSv, compared to the highest 7.32 SD 3.51 mSv and 6.20 SD 4.38 mSv (p for trend <0.0001 in both).

114,1352,"Timed barium swallow and its usefullness in achalasia and non-achalasia dysphagia Introduction: Timed barium swallow (TBS) was initially described by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic (AJR 1997). This test was designed to assess esophageal emptying in patients (pts) with achalasia before and after therapy, i.e. pneumatic dilation/ surgical myotomy. Over time it became part of standard workup at our Swallowing Center in all dysphagia cases. It is simple to perform, radiation exposure is minimal and it gives details on both esophageal anatomy and emptying of liquids and tablet. Our aim was to determine the usefulness of TBS in pts with non-achalasia dysphagia in comparison to achalasia pts. Method(s): Retrospective review of medical records of 150 consecutive pts who underwent TBS evaluation between 04/2014 and 09/2015 at our Institution. Pts were separated into achalasia and non-achalasia groups. Diagnosis of achalasia established by high resolution manometry. Standard protocol was used for all TBS. After drinking 6-8 oz of low density barium in the standing position, lateral film obtained followed by two-on-one spot films at 1 and 5 min. to assess liquid emptying. The esophagus was rinsed with water followed by ingestion of a 13 mm tablet. Tablet passage evaluated after 5 minutes with an abnormal test being tablet retention. TBS for liquid barium considered normal if < 1 cm of barium retention after 1 min in distal esophagus. One radiologist (JF) interpreted all TBS. Result(s): 72 pts (49% females) with achalasia/ mean age 57 years (type 1: 12 pts (17%), type 2: 35 pts (49%), type 3: 7 pts (10%), achalasia type not specified 18 pts (24%)) and 78 pts (62% females) without achalasia/ mean age of 62.25 years. Table 1 defines final diagnoses in non-achalasia pts. Achalasia pts more frequently had abnormal TBS than non-achalasia pts (96% vs. 65%, p < 0.0001). Table 2: characteristics of TBS in both groups. Non-esophageal findings identified on TBS in 10% of achalasia and in 20% of non-achalasia pts including musculoskeletal lesions (20 pts), lung nodule (5 pts), hilar prominence or calcifications (4 pts) and cardiomegaly or aortic calcifications (4 pts). Lung cancer found in 1 non-achalasia patient. Conclusion(s): 1. TBS is a simple and useful test in separation of achalasia and non-achalasia dysphagia. 2.

Pts with non-achalasia dysphagia are more likely to have abnormal TBS either for liquid barium or tablet only than achalasia pts.",Excluded,0.17129776
115,1353,"Kypho-IORT: Intraoperative radiotherapy in spinal metastases: Nine-month clinical results BACKGROUND CONTEXT: A new technique of combined kyphoplasty and intraoperative radiation therapy (Kypho-IORT) was introduced in 2010 [1]. The indication, rationale and possible advantages have been published in 2011 [2]. In the first clinical period several technical improvements and modifications could stabilize the method, its clinical feasibility and shortterm safety has been shown [3]. Due to the higher local radiation doses compared to extracorporal radiotherapy (EBRT) permitted by the steep dose fall off of the IORT-source a higher local tumor control can potentially be achieved by Kypho-IORT. In this study we present an intermediate prospective follow-up of 9-month after Kypho-IORT. PURPOSE: Local tumor control and clinical use of Kypho-IORT. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Evidence level IV: prospective case series. PATIENT SAMPLE: 62 patients suffering from 77 spinal metastases which were treated with Kypho-IORT were included in the prospective study. Data of 16 patients who finished the 4th follow-up appointment after around 9 months and were interpreted. OUTCOME MEASURES: Acquired basic data were gender, age at surgery, tumor entity, treated vertebral level, delivered dose. Prospective collected data were pain measure by visual analogue scale (VAS) preoperative and at follow-up, Karnofsky Index, local metastasis control in the treated vertebra and general progression of metastases by CT or MRI. METHOD(S): Clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations. RESULT(S): 16 patients (12 females, 4 males) with an average age of 61 years were included. Twelve patients had breast cancer, two patients suffered prostate cancer and one each with lung, ovarian and sigmoid cancer. Thirteen thoracic and 4 lumbar vertebrae were treated with an average surgical time of 70 minutes per vertebra. The time from surgery to the 9-month follow-up was in average 348 days. The Karnofsky index was constant with 87 preoperative versus 86 at follow-up. The VAS average decreased from 4.1 preoperative to 1.4 postoperative and 0.8 at follow-up. In all cases but two, a dose of 8gy in a radius of 5mm was delivered successfully, two cases with second dose level at 8gy in 8mm distance to isocenter. Three patients had a local progress, one patient due to incorrect indication. Two vertebrae needed open revision surgery; one local progress was treated only with EBRT. Eight patients showed a general tumor progress. CONCLUSION(S): Kypho-IORT can offer a fast postoperative pain reduction, immediate stabilization and prevention of secondary fractures in the treated vertebrae by kyphoplasty which could be confirmed in this small cohort. The VAS decreased postoperative and this level was maintained during follow-up. Local tumor control (indication failures ignored) by intraoperative radiation could be achieved in 87% of the vertebrae over the 9 months period, which seems to be better than single fraction radiation schedules and at least comparable to multiple fraction schedules of conventional radiation. Furthermore the Karnofsky-Index stayed constant over the follow-up period which proves the low morbidity of the intervention in short and in intermediate term. All 14 of 16 patients of the 9-month-follow- up were treated with the lowest calculated treatment dose; probably an even higher local tumor control is achievable by higher local radiation doses.These results warrant further evaluation of this technique by a dose escalation and a multicenter study, which is currently under way.",Excluded,0.17130391

118,1356,"The perception of voice onset time: an fMRI investigation of phonetic category structure This study explored the neural systems underlying the perception of phonetic category structure by investigating the perception of a voice onset time (VOT) continuum in a phonetic categorization task. Stimuli consisted of five synthetic speech stimuli which ranged in VOT from 0 msec ([da]) to 40 msec ([ta]). Results from 12 subjects showed that the neural system is sensitive to VOT differences of 10 msec and that details of phonetic category structure are retained throughout the phonetic processing stream. Both the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and cingulate showed graded activation as a function of category membership with increasing activation as stimuli approached the phonetic category boundary. These results are consistent with the view that the left IFG is involved in phonetic decision processes, with the extent of activation influenced by increased resources devoted to resolving phonetic category membership and/or selecting between competing phonetic categories. Activation patterns in the cingulate suggest that it is sensitive to stimulus difficulty and resolving response conflict. In contrast, activation in the posterior left middle temporal gyrus and the left angular gyrus showed modulation of activation only to the ""best fit"" of the phonetic category, suggesting that these areas are involved in mapping sound structure to its phonetic representation. The superior temporal gyrus (STG) bilaterally showed weaker sensitivity to the differences in phonetic category structure, providing further evidence that the STG is involved in the early analysis of the sensory properties of speech.",Excluded,0.18744162
120,1358,"Gamma Knife radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma: clinical results at long-term follow-up in a series of 379 patients OBJECT: Since the 1990 s, Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has become the first-line treatment option for small- to medium-size vestibular schwannomas (VSs), especially in patients without mass effect-related symptoms and with functional hearing. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of GKRS, in terms of tumor control, hearing preservation, and complications, in a series of 379 consecutive patients treated for VS., METHODS: Of 523 patients treated at the authors' institution for VS between 2001 and 2010, the authors included 379 who underwent GKRS as the primary treatment. These patients were not affected by Type 2 neurofibromatosis and had clinical follow-up of at least 36 months. Clinical follow-up (mean and median 75.7 and 69.5 months, respectively) was performed for all patients, whereas audiometric and quantitative radiological follow-up examinations were obtained for only 153 and 219 patients, respectively. The patients' ages ranged from 23 to 85 years (mean 59 years). The mean tumor volume was 1.94 +/- 2.2 cm(3) (median 1.2 cm(3), range 0.013-14.3 cm(3)), and the median margin dose was 13 Gy (range 11-15 Gy). Parameters considered as determinants of the clinical outcome were long-term tumor control, hearing preservation, and complications. A statistical analysis was performed to correlate clinical outcomes with the radiological features of the tumor, dose-planning parameters, and patient characteristics., RESULTS: Control of the tumor with GKRS was achieved in 97.1% of the patients. In 82.7% of the patients, the tumor volume had decreased at the last follow-up, with a mean relative reduction of 34.1%. The rate of complications was very low, with most consisting of a transient worsening of preexisting symptoms. Patients who had vertigo, balance disorders, or facial or trigeminal impairment usually experienced a complete or at least significant symptom relief after treatment. However, no significant improvement was observed in patients previously reporting tinnitus. The overall rate of preservation of functional hearing at the long-term follow-up was 49%; in patients with hearing classified as Gardner-Robertson (GR) Class I, this value was 71% and reached 93% among cases of GR Class I hearing in patients younger than 55 years., CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife radiosurgery is a safe and effective treatment for VS, achieving tumor control in 97.1% of cases and resulting in a very low morbidity rate. Younger GR Class I patients had a significantly higher probability of retaining functional hearing even at the 10-year follow-up; for this reason, the time between symptom onset, diagnosis, and treatment should be shortened to achieve better outcomes in functional hearing preservation.",Excluded,0.17497517
121,1359,"Differentiation between brain tumor recurrence and radiation injury using perfusion, diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopy BACKGROUND: Differentiation between tumor recurrence/vital tumor tissue and radionecrosis based on conventional diagnostic imaging is impossible because of the likeness of the images. In such circumstances advanced MRI techniques (PWI, DWI, 1HMRS) seem to be helpful. The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic effectiveness of PWI, DWI and 1HMRS in the differentiation of the tumor recurrence from radiation related injury., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The retrospective analysis comprised 11 contrast-enhancing lesions observed in 8 patients treated for gliomas with radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy. 5 out of 11 contrast-enhancing lesions were tumor recurrences whereas 6 out of 11 radiation-related injuries. The MR examinations comprised of conventional MR imaging (T1-SE, T1-MPRAGE with CE, T2-TSE, T2 FLAIR) and PWI, DWI, 1HMRS. Mean and maximum rCBV values of each contrast-enhancing lesion were calculated. These values were normalized to normal appearing white matter. Mean normalized ADC ratio to normal appearing white matter and mean ADC obtained from contrast-enhancing lesions were analysed. In 1HMRS only those voxels which were placed in solid part of the contrast-enhancing lesion were analysed and Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA ratios presented., RESULTS: Mean normalized rCBVmax (2.44 +/- 0.73 for tumor recurrence vs. 0.78 +/- 0.46 for radiation injury; p < 0.001) and mean normalized rCBVmean (1.46 +/- 0.49 for tumor recurrence vs. 0.49 +/- 0.38 for radiation injury; p < 0.005) were significantly higher in the recurrent gliomas group than in the radiation injury one. It was observed that normalized rCBVmax higher than 1.7 and normalized rCBVmean higher than 1.25 is highly indicative for recurrent glioma whereas normalized rCBVmax lower than 1.0 and normalized rCBVmean lower than 0.5 is highly indicative for radiation injury. Results obtained in DWI and 1HMRS were not statistically significant different between two analysed groups. Mean ADCce: 1.06 +/- 0.18 x 10-3 mm2/s for tumor recurrence vs. 1.13 +/- 0.13 x 10-3 mm2/s for radiation injury; p = 0.51. Mean normalized ADC: 1.55 +/- 0.39 x 10-3 mm2/s for tumor recurrence vs. 1.55 +/- 0.18 x 10-3 mm2/s for radiation injury; p = 0.98.

130,1368,"Positive impact of low-dose, high-energy radiation on bone in partial- and/or full-weightbearing mice Astronauts traveling beyond low Earth orbit will be exposed to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR); understanding how high energy ionizing radiation modifies the bone response to mechanical unloading is important to assuring crew health. To investigate this, we exposed 4-mo-old female Balb/cBYJ mice to an acute space-relevant dose of 0.5 Gy 56Fe or sham (n = ~8/group); 4 days later, half of the mice were also subjected to a ground-based analog for 1/6 g (partial weightbearing) (G/6) for 21 days. Microcomputed tomography (-CT) of the distal femur reveals that 56Fe exposure resulted in 6578% greater volume and improved microarchitecture of cancellous bone after 21 d compared to sham controls. Radiation also leads to significant increases in three measures of energy absorption at the mid-shaft femur and an increase in stiffness of the L4 vertebra. No significant effects of radiation on bone formation indices are detected; however, G/6 leads to reduced % mineralizing surface on the inner mid-tibial bone surface. In separate groups allowed 21 days of weightbearing recovery from G/6 and/or 56Fe exposure, radiation-exposed mice still exhibit greater bone mass and improved microarchitecture vs. sham control. However, femoral bone energy absorption values are no longer higher in the 56Fe-exposed WB mice vs. sham controls. We provide evidence for persistent positive impacts of high-LET radiation exposure preceding a period of full or partial weightbearing on bone mass and microarchitecture in the distal femur and, for full weightbearing mice only and more transiently, cortical bone energy absorption values. 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.9597632
133,1371,"Drug exposure and risk of microscopic colitis: a nationwide Danish case-control study with 5751 cases BACKGROUND: Previous small studies have indicated that commonly prescribed drugs may be associated with microscopic colitis (MC). With an increasing incidence of MC, it is important to explore the association between exposure to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and MC in a larger setting., METHODS: Case-control study based on nationwide Danish registries. The study included all patients with MC diagnosis during the period 2005 to 2011. One hundred sex- and age-matched controls per case were randomly selected among the Danish population. Prescriptions were recorded in a Prescription Register in the year before the first recorded MC diagnosis. Effect measure is the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) according to prescriptions of PPIs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Within the control group, we identified a subgroup with MC-free colonic biopsies., RESULTS: We identified 3474 patients with CC and 2277 with LC and found a positive association between redemption of prescriptions for PPIs and both CC (OR = 7.04; 95% confidence interval, 6.55-7.56) and LC (OR = 3.37; 95% confidence interval, 3.08-3.69). Among patients with MC-free colon biopsies in the control group, the association between PPIs and CC was strongly positive (OR = 3.47; 95% confidence interval, 3.08-3.89). Adding this parameter to the model attenuated all of the associations, but they remained positive for PPIs versus CC and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors versus LC., CONCLUSIONS: We found positive associations between exposure to all 4 medication classes and MC.

Design Retrospective analysis of electronic patient records. Setting Tertiary academic health science centre and designated centre for high consequence infectious diseases in London, UK. Participants 1198 patients who attended the emergency department with paired reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) swabs for SARS-CoV-2 and CXR between 16 March and 16 April 2020. Main outcome measures Sensitivity and specificity of CXR and CT for diagnosis of COVID-19 using the British Society of Thoracic Imaging reporting templates. Reference standard was any RT-PCR positive naso-oropharyngeal swab within 30 days of attendance. ORs of CXR in association with vital signs, laboratory values and 30-day outcomes were calculated. Results Sensitivity and specificity of CXR for COVID-19 diagnosis were 0.56 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.60) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.65), respectively. For CT scans, these were 0.85 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.90) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.60), respectively. This gave a statistically significant mean increase in sensitivity with CT of 29% (95% CI 19% to 38%, p<0.0001) compared with CXR. Specificity was not significantly different between the two modalities. CXR findings were not statistically significantly or clinically meaningfully associated with vital signs, laboratory parameters or 30-day outcomes. Conclusions CT has substantially improved diagnostic performance over CXR in COVID-19. CT should be strongly considered in the initial assessment for suspected COVID-19. This gives potential for increased sensitivity and considerably faster turnaround time, where capacity allows and balanced against excess radiation exposure risk.Copyright ©",Excluded,0.17223287
142,1380,"[UV risk perception by the general public: results of a representative questionnaire in Germany] For public health promotion purposes it is important to know how the general public perceives the risk factor ""UV exposure"" and how UV risk perception is connected to health-related attitudes and beliefs. The aim of the study was to collect representative data about UV risk perception in Germany. A representative telephone survey using the ADM design was carried out among 1 501 German residents between May and July 2007. Variables related to UV risk knowledge, relevance of risk topics in every-day thinking and risk estimates were investigated. Data regarding a subjective benefit evaluation of UV exposition was also collected. The results suggest no essential gaps in the general knowledge about UV risks, except for the underestimation of UV-related cataracts. The respondents thought it extremely likely that UV exposure would cause health damage such as skin cancer, photoaging or sun burns. People were asked to report how often they had thought about a number of health risks including UV risks in the last two weeks. It was established that UV risks are present but not dominant in people's every-day thinking. Along with it, the risk evaluation proves to be rather moderate. The mean value for respondents' perceived personal risk is M=5.1, in the midsection of the given 10-point scale. The results show that perceived personal risk is not influenced by the serious UV health risks such as cancer or cataracts. The results also indicate that UV benefit and UV risk perception are not strongly related to one another. In summary, participants' perception and assessment of the various health risks of UV exposure seem to be realistic, but the UV risk assessment it is not related to the perception of personal risk. One must therefore assume that UV health risk information and education campaigns do not necessarily lead to a change in the perception of personal UV risk. Rather than addressing primarily risk knowledge, UV risk communication should focus more on motivational aspects and consider the role of UV benefit perception. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Objective(s): To evaluate the clinical feasibility, accuracy, and efficiency of a single-position technique for LLIF with bilateral pedicle screw and rod fixation. Summary of background data: Minimally-invasive lateral interbody approaches are performed in the lateral decubitus position. Subsequent repositioning prone for bilateral pedicle screw and rod fixation requires significant time and resources and does not facilitate increased lumbar lordosis. Method(s): The first 32 consecutive patients (128 screws) treated with single-position LLIF and bilateral pedicle screws by a single surgeon between December 2016 and August 2018 were included in the study. O-Arm 3d imaging combined to navigation was employed in this setting. Fusion were graded using computed tomography and several timing parameters were recorded including retractor, irradiation, and screw placement time. Complications including reoperation, infection, and postoperative radicular pain and weakness were recorded. Result(s): Average screw placement time was 1.2 min/screw.

145,1383,"Informatics in radiology: use of a C-arm fluoroscopy simulator to support training in intraoperative radiography Mobile image intensifier systems (C-arms) are used frequently in orthopedic and reconstructive surgery, especially in trauma and emergency settings, but image quality and radiation exposure levels may vary widely, depending on the extent of the C-arm operator's knowledge and experience. Current training programs consist mainly of theoretical instruction in C-arm operation, the physical foundations of radiography, and radiation avoidance, and are largely lacking in hands-on application. A computer-based simulation program such as that tested by the authors may be one way to improve the effectiveness of C-arm training. In computer simulations of various scenarios commonly encountered in the operating room, trainees using the virtX program interact with three-dimensional models to test their knowledge base and improve their skill levels. Radiographs showing the simulated patient anatomy and surgical implants are ""reconstructed"" from data computed on the basis of the trainee's positioning of models of a C-arm, patient, and table, and are displayed in real time on the desktop monitor. Trainee performance is signaled in real time by color graphics in several control panels and, on completion of the exercise, is compared in detail with the performance of an expert operator. Testing of this computer-based training program in continuing medical education courses for operating room personnel showed an improvement in the overall understanding of underlying principles of intraoperative radiography performed with a C-arm, with resultant higher image quality, lower overall radiation exposure, and greater time efficiency.

Dynamic instability of wrist--occurring during joint motion--is a complex condition that has assumed increased importance in musculoskeletal medicine. The objective of this study was to develop an MRI protocol for evaluating the wrist during continuous active motion, to show that dynamic imaging of the wrist is realizable, and to demonstrate that the resulting anatomical images enable the measurement of metrics commonly evaluated for dynamic wrist instability., METHODS: A 3-Tesla ""active-MRI"" protocol was developed using a bSSFP sequence with 475 ms temporal resolution for continuous imaging of the moving wrist. Fifteen wrists of 10 asymptomatic volunteers were scanned during active supination/pronation, radial/ulnar deviation, ""clenched-fist"", and volarflexion/dorsiflexion maneuvers. Two physicians evaluated distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) congruity, extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon translation, the scapholunate (SL) interval, and the SL, radiolunate (RL) and capitolunate (CL) angles from the resulting images., RESULTS: The mean DRUJ subluxation ratio was 0.04 in supination, 0.10 in neutral, and 0.14 in pronation. The ECU tendon was subluxated or translated out of its groove in 3 wrists in pronation, 9 wrists in neutral, and 11 wrists in supination. The mean SL interval was 1.43 mm for neutral, ulnar deviation, radial deviation positions, and increased to 1.64 mm during the clenched-fist maneuver.

153,1391,"Preliminary Evidence That Cortical Amyloid Burden Predicts Poor Response to Antidepressant Medication Treatment in Cognitively Intact Individuals With Late-Life Depression Objective: Amyloid accumulation, the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, may predispose some older adults to depression and cognitive decline. Deposition of amyloid also occurs prior to the development of cognitive decline. It is unclear whether amyloid influences antidepressant outcomes in cognitively intact depressed elders. Design(s): A pharmacoimaging trial utilizing florbetapir (18F) PET scanning followed by 2 sequential 8-week antidepressant medication trials. Participant(s): Twenty-seven depressed elders who were cognitively intact on screening. Measurements and Interventions: After screening, diagnostic testing, assessment of depression severity and neuropsychological assessment, participants completed florbetapir (18F) PET scanning. They were then randomized to receive escitalopram or placebo for 8 weeks in a double-blinded two-to-one allocation rate. Individuals who did not respond to initial treatment transitioned to a second open-label trial of bupropion for another 8 weeks. Result(s): Compared with 22 amyloid-negative participants, 5 amyloid-positive participants exhibited significantly less change in depression severity and a lower likelihood of remission. In the initial blinded trial, 4 of 5 amyloid-positive participants were nonremitters (80%), while only 18% (4 of 22) of amyloid-negative participants did not remit (p = 0.017; Fisher's Exact test). In separate models adjusting for key covariates, both positive amyloid status (t = 3.07, 21 df, p = 0.003) and higher cortical amyloid binding by standard uptake value ratio (t = 2.62, 21 df, p = 0.010) were associated with less improvement in depression severity. Similar findings were observed when examining change in depression status across both antidepressant trials. Conclusion(s): In this preliminary study, amyloid status predicted poor antidepressant response to sequential antidepressant treatment. Alternative treatment approaches may be needed for amyloid-positive depressed elders.Copyright © 2020",Excluded,0.17549634

The quality of MP-CTA was assessed quantitatively measuring vessel attenuation, image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio. MP-CTA was evaluated qualitatively regarding depiction of vessels, cortex differentiation, and motion artifacts (grades 1-4, 1 = best). Mean effective radiation dose was registered. Results were compared to standard renal computed tomography angiography (CTA) (80 mL). Student t test was applied, if variables followed normal distribution. For other variables, nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used., RESULTS: All acquisitions were successfully performed, and no patient had to be excluded from the study. MP-CTA enabled high attenuation (aorta: 503 +/- 91 HU, renal arteries: 450 +/- 73 HU/456 +/- 72 HU) at adequate image noise (13.7 +/- 1.5) and good contrast-to-noise ratio (34.2 +/- 10.2). Good attenuation of renal veins was observed (286 +/- 43 HU/282 +/- 42 HU). Arterial enhancement was significantly higher compared to renal CTA (aorta: 396 +/- 90 HU, renal arteries: 331 +/- 74 HU/333 +/- 80 HU; P < .001). MP-CTA protocol enabled good image quality of renal arteries (1.5 +/- 0.6) and veins (1.7 +/- 0.6). Cortex differentiation and motion artifacts were ranked 1.8 +/- 0.8 and 1.6 +/- 0.8. The mean effective radiation dose was 9 mSv (MP-CTA)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared to standard renal CTA, the renal MP-CTA enabled the significant reduction of contrast volume and simultaneously provided a significantly higher arterial attenuation.

162,1400,"Effect of X-irradiation on epidermal immune function: decreased density and alloantigen-presenting capacity of Ia+ Langerhans cells and impaired production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF) The mechanisms involved in the modulation of cutaneous immune responses by UV radiation have been extensively investigated; by contrast, few studies have addressed the effects of x-irradiation on epidermal immune function. We therefore investigated the effect of x-irradiation of mice on: (a) the density of epidermal Ia+ Langerhans cells (LC) in immunofluorescence studies, (b) epidermal cell (EC) allostimulatory capacity in the allogeneic EC-lymphocyte reaction (ELR), and (c) production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF). C3H/He and BALB/c mice were irradiated with 900, 1,800, 2,700, or 3,600 rad from a 137Cs source, and sacrificed 10 h or 3 days later. X-irradiation of mice 10 h previously only slightly decreased the density of epidermal Ia+ LC and did not affect the capacity of their EC to stimulate allogeneic responder lymphocytes in the ELR. X-irradiation of mice 3 days previously, however, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the density of Ia+ LC. This decrease was accompanied by a substantial reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity in the ELR at all doses of x-irradiation. ETAF production by cultured EC from mice x-irradiated 3 days previously was also found to be diminished at all doses of x-irradiation. Trypan blue exclusion studies demonstrated that the observed decreases in EC allostimulatory capacity and ETAF production were not the result of a generalized lethal effect of x-irradiation on EC. The reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity following in vivo x-irradiation could not be reversed by addition of exogenous ETAF or interleukin-1 in the ELR. Taken together, these results indicate that x-irradiation decreases the density of Ia+ LC, impairs LC alloantigen-presenting function, and reduces ETAF production. Thus cutaneous x-irradiation may affect inflammatory and neoplastic processes not only by its antimitotic activity, but also by a direct effect on EC which subserve immunologic functions.",Included,0.95543146

164,1402,"Endonasal phototherapy significantly alleviates symptoms of allergic rhinitis, but has a limited impact on the nasal mucosal immune cells The literature documents the fact that UV irradiation of cutaneous Langerhans cells (LC) in vivo prevents the development of contact allergy and produces long-lasting immunosuppression. However, not much is known about the effect of UV irradiation on the LC of the nasal mucosa and their connection with clinical scores. Local antigen presentation may be necessary for both primary and recall T cell responses to birch pollen in patients with hay fever. Endonasal phototherapy combination of UVB (5%), UVA (25%) and visible light (70%) utilises the immunosuppressive effects of UV irradiation. The aim of this study was to correlate clinical symptom scores with possible changes in the LC of the nasal mucosa induced by UV radiation. The clinical effectiveness of this form of treatment is discussed. Nasal biopsies were obtained from ten birch pollen-sensitive patients with seasonal rhinitis before and after endonasal phototherapy. All patients showed a significant clinical benefit post-treatment as assessed by standardised instruments, including total nasal symptom score, nasal congestion score, nasal itching score, sneezing score, nasal secretion score and impairment-to-health score. However, we found no significant morphological changes, to, or quantitative differences in, the CD1a+, CD4, CD8 or CD31 cells before and 14 days after treatment. Despite the positive clinical effect, the study revealed no effect of UV irradiation on the LC and other analysed cells of the nasal mucosa immune system.

In this study, we evaluated breast cancer incidence in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors, adding 11 years of follow-up and incorporating reproductive history data. We used Poisson regression models to describe radiation risks and modifying effects of age and reproductive factors. Among 62,534 females, we identified 1,470 breast cancers between 1958 and 2009. Of 397 new cases diagnosed since 1998, 75% were exposed before age 20. We found a strong linear dose response with excess relative risk (ERR) of 1.12 per Gy 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73 to 1.59 for females at age 70 after exposure at age 30. The ERR decreased with increasing attained age (P = 0.007) while excess absolute rate (EAR) increased with attained age up to age 70 (P < 0.001). Age at menarche was a strong modifier of the radiation effect: for a given dose, both the ERR and EAR decreased with increasing age at menarche (P = 0.007 and P < 0.001). Also, independently, age-At-exposure effects on ERR and EAR differed before and after menarche (P = 0.043 and P = 0.015, respectively, relative to log-linear trends), with highest risks for exposures around menarche. Despite the small number of male breast cancers (n = 10), the data continue to suggest a dose response (ERR per Gy = 5.7; 95% CI: 0.3 to 30.8; P = 0.018). Persistently increased risk of female breast cancer after radiation exposure and its modification pattern suggests heightened breast sensitivity during puberty.Copyright © 2018 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.95593053
171,1409,"Fluoro-less ureteral stent placement following uncomplicated ureteroscopic stone removal: a feasibility study OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of ureteral stent placement without image guidance after uncomplicated ureteral stone removal and to compare the outcomes of fluoro-less and conventional ureteral stent placement., METHODS: A technique was devised to allow placement of a ureteral stent without image guidance by substituting fluoroscopy with visual and tactile cues. A retrospective review of 25 patients using fluoro-less stent placement was compared with 25 consecutive patients who underwent conventional stent placement with fluoroscopy. Stent placement was graded on a 6-point scale to assess coil symmetry and location. Comparisons between the fluoro-less stent placements and controls were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test. All hypotheses were 2-sided and conducted at an alpha level of 0.05., RESULTS: All 25 ureteral stent placements were performed successfully without the use of fluoroscopy for image guidance. There was no significant difference in age, gender, body mass index, stone size, or complication rates when fluoro-less and conventional stent placements were compared. In addition, grade 1 placement was achieved in 76% of the fluoro-less group and in 64% of the conventional group. Although placement accuracy was higher in the fluoro-less group this was not statistically significant (P = .13)., CONCLUSION: Ureteral stent placement without fluoroscopic guidance is feasible. It maintains comparable efficacy and complication rates with conventional ureteral stent placement. This technique allows reduced radiation exposure in patients requiring ureteral stent placement.

173,1411,"An investigation of different types of eyewear and face shields in protecting patients and operators from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation BACKGROUND: Phototherapy and photochemotherapy are commonly used treatment modalities for a range of chronic skin conditions. Whilst undergoing ultraviolet radiation exposure, patients can wear personal protective equipment. Face shields in combination with other forms of skin cover may be worn to provide both skin and eye protection. There are a number of different types of eyewear and face shields available for purchase. Some of these have clear identifications that show the levels of protection provided whilst others may not have any., METHODS: A series of similar experiments has been undertaken independently at two phototherapy treatment centres-Chapel Allerton Hospital, Leeds and Ninewells Hospital, Dundee-to investigate the effectiveness of different face shields and eye protection that are available for purchase in the United Kingdom (UK). Two similar examples of one face shield were tested at both centres, and another was transferred between the units., RESULTS: Not all examples of the face shields and protective eyewear provided the wearer full protection between 300 nanometres and 400 nanometres (nm). Cost and conformance to different standards was not always a good indicator. Some inexpensive examples tested also met British Association of Dermatology protective sunglasses guidelines., CONCLUSIONS: It is incumbent on all centres to check the properties of protective face shields and eyewear provided to patients and operators to guard against the effects from ultraviolet radiation. There is no correlation between price of the protective equipment and level of protection offered, and there may be opportunity for cost savings. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

174,1412,"Predicting urban outdoor thermal comfort by the Universal Thermal Climate Index UTCI-a case study in Southern Brazil Recognising that modifications to the physical attributes of urban space are able to promote improved thermal outdoor conditions and thus positively influence the use of open spaces, a survey to define optimal thermal comfort ranges for passers-by in pedestrian streets was conducted in Curitiba, Brazil. We applied general additive models to study the impact of temperature, humidity, and wind, as well as long-wave and short-wave radiant heat fluxes as summarised by the recently developed Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) on the choice of clothing insulation by fitting LOESS smoothers to observations from 944 males and 710 females aged from 13 to 91 years. We further analysed votes of thermal sensation compared to predictions of UTCI. The results showed that females chose less insulating clothing in warm conditions compared to males and that observed values of clothing insulation depended on temperature, but also on season and potentially on solar radiation. The overall pattern of clothing choice was well reflected by UTCI, which also provided for good predictions of thermal sensation votes depending on the meteorological conditions. Analysing subgroups indicated that the goodness-of-fit of the UTCI was independent of gender and age, and with only limited influence of season and body composition as assessed by body mass index. This suggests that UTCI can serve as a suitable planning tool for urban thermal comfort in sub-tropical regions. © 2011 ISB.",Excluded,0.17685683

A 24-year-old man, also a jogger, had had increasing pain in his right lower leg for 4 months, which turned out to be due to a fracture of the posteromedial border of the tibia at the insertion of the flexor digitorum longus muscle. A 35-year-old woman presented with pain in her left foot and ankle that was due to a march fracture of the second metatarsal bone after over 5 hours of intermittent use of the clutch in a traffic jam. In all 3 patients, temporary cessation of the causative activity was sufficient for complete recovery after 3 months. Stress fractures are easily missed on X-rays. Treatment is conservative and consists of the elimination of causative factors to allow adequate healing. In selected cases, a splint or brace may be indicated. Furthermore, certain high risk and displaced fractures should be considered for surgical fixation.

The aim of this study was to estimate the human radiation doses of (11)C-PBR28 based on biodistribution data in monkeys and humans. In addition, we scanned 1 human subject who fortuitously behaved as if he lacked the PBR binding protein., METHODS: Whole-body PBR images were acquired after intravenous bolus administration of (11)C-PBR28 in 7 healthy humans (651 +/- 111 MBq) and 2 rhesus monkeys (370 +/- 59.9 MBq). One monkey was scanned after receptor blockade with PK 11195 (10.7 mg/kg intravenously)., RESULTS: For typical subjects (subjects 1-6), the 3 organs with highest exposure were those with the high PBR densities (kidneys, spleen, and lungs), and the effective dose was 6.6 microSv/MBq. The unusual subject (subject 7) had 60%-90% less uptake in these 3 organs, resulting in 28% lower effective dose. The activity in the baseline monkey scans was greater than that in humans for organs with high PBR densities. For this reason, the human effective dose was overestimated by 60% with monkey biodistribution data. The monkey with receptor blockade had an overall distribution qualitatively similar to that of the unusual human subject (subject 7), with decreased exposure to lungs, kidney, and spleen., CONCLUSION: The effective dose of (11)C-PBR28 was modest and was similar to that of several other (11)C-radioligands. Lack of receptor binding in the unusual human subject and in the monkey with receptor blockade decreased exposure to organs with high PBR densities and enhanced uptake in excretory and metabolic pathways.",Excluded,0.17855696
183,1421,"Brain metastases resection cavity radio-surgery based on T2-weighted MRI: technique assessment Purpose: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is commonly performed after surgical resection of brain metastases to reduce the chance of local tumor recurrence while maintaining cognitive function. Target delineation in these cases is typically based off T1-weighted post-gadolinium MRI (T1Gd). In this study, we report outcomes for patients having postoperative SRS in which the planning target volume (PTV) was based on T2-weighted MRI (T2W). Method(s): Sixty-two consecutive patients having single-fraction SRS after brain metastases resection were retrospectively reviewed. Excluded were patients with prior whole brain radiation therapy, multiple resection cavities, and small cell pathologies. Result(s): The median time from surgery to SRS was 11 days; 26 patients (42%) had SRS <= 7 days. The median PTV was 8.0 cm3; the median margin dose was 18 Gy. The crude rates of local tumor control (LC), leptomeningeal disease (LMD), distant brain recurrence (DBR), and radiation necrosis (RN) were 85%, 19%, 37%, and 2%, respectively. The 1-year LC, LMD, DBR, and RN rates were 88%, 25%, 36%, and 0%, respectively. No tumor or dosimetric factor was associated with LC. Sub-total tumor resection was a risk factor for LMD (HR 5.11, P = 0.003), whereas patients with multiple brain metastases had a greater risk of DBR (HR 2.88, P = 0.01). The median PTV was smaller compared to the median PTV based off the consensus guidelines utilizing T1Gd MRI (8.0 cm3 vs. 9.1 cm3, P = 0.004). Conclusion(s): T2W MRI provided accurate resection cavity delineation even in the early postoperative period and was associated with decreased PTV compared to T1Gd MRI in the majority of cases.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded,0.17044753
185,1423,"Cancer control knowledge and priorities among primary care physicians Primary care physicians can play a key role in prevention and early detection of cancer. To assess cancer control knowledge and priorities among primary care physicians in Missouri, we conducted a random survey of 207 physicians. Although reported knowledge of the role tobacco plays in cancer causation was high, activity in tobacco cessation counselling and referral was low. Respondents considered diet to be a relatively unimportant factor in cancer causation, whereas they viewed sun exposure, genetics/family history, and radiation exposure as large contributors to the cancer burden. Among cancer early detection tests, high activity was shown for the Pap test and breast examination. Conversely, low activity was reported for colon sigmoidoscopy. Inverse correlations were shown between age group of the physician and several cancer prevention and early detection practices. For each cancer prevention and screening practice, reported activity was higher for medical doctors than for doctors of osteopathic medicine. Possible barriers or controversies in cancer control included disagreement with the current recommendation for Pap testing, the cost of mammography, and patient fear of sigmoidoscopy.

The bone-seeking, alpha-particle-emitting radiopharmaceutical Alpharadin, 223RaCl2 (half-life=11.4 days), is under clinical development as a novel treatment for skeletal metastases from breast and prostate cancer. This article summarizes the current status of preclinical and clinical research on 223RaCl2. Potential advantages of 223Ra to that of external beam irradiation and registered beta-emitting bone seekers are discussed. Published data of 223Ra dosimetry in mice and a therapeutic study in a skeletal metastases model in nude rats have indicated significant therapeutic potential of bone-seeking alpha-emitters. This article provides short-term and long-term results from the first clinical single dosage trial. We also present data from a repeated dosage study of five consecutive injections of 50 kBq/kg body weight, once every 3rd week, or two injections of 125 kBq/kg body weight, 6 weeks apart. Furthermore, interim results are described for a randomized phase 2 trial involving 64 patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and painful skeletal metastases who received four monthly injections of 223Ra or saline as an adjuvant to external beam radiotherapy.

200,1438,"Investigating the role of FDG-PET/CT for preoperative lymph-node staging of bladder cancer: Our preliminary experience Introduction: In patients with nonmetastatic invasive bladder cancer (T2 or higher, M0) or recurrent high-risk non-muscle invasive disease (T1G3 with or without Tis, M0), locoregional lymph node metastasis is an important prognostic factor. The standard imaging modalities for staging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) have an accuracy range of 70-90% for lymph-node staging. Fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) has been approved for imaging in many malignancies but not for bladder cancer. This study investigated the value of FDGPET/ CT for preoperative lymph-node staging of patients with MIBC. We present our preliminary results. Patients and Methods: Between September 2012 and February 2013, 10 patients (8 male, 2 female) with bladder cancer underwent FDG-PET/CT and a thoraco-abdominal CT scan. Four patients were found to be recurrent T1G3 at TUR-B, five T2G3 and one T2G2. Independently from the results for lymphnode status at FDG-PET/CT or at abdominal CT scan, all patients underwent radical cystectomy and lymphadenectomy. Results of FDG-PET/CT and CT for N-staging were compared to histopathology findings. Complete data are available for 8 patients. Result(s): Among the 8 patients, 3 patients had metastatically involved locoregional lymph nodes, diagnosed on histopathology. In all these patients, the lymph-nodes demonstrated increased FDG uptake on PET/CT; the same nodes were not considered as metastatic at abdominal CT scan. Five patients had lymph-nodes with a normal FDG uptake on PET/CT: these nodes were found nonmetastatic at histopathology. Only 1 patient had nodes suspected for metastases at CT scan but not at FDGPET/CT: these lymphnodes were found nonmetastatic at histopathology. The accordance between histopathology and FDG-PET/CT findings was 100%. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Our preliminary data show that FDG-PET/CT may provide better accuracy in N-staging of bladder cancer; our study is still ongoing because a larger sample (at least 50-75 patients) is needed. According to our results and to data in the Literature, larger prospective studies are needed to elucidate the effective role of FDG-PET/CT in N-staging of bladder cancer.",Excluded,0.1707119

202,1440,"MiR-19 in blood plasma reflects lung cancer occurrence but is not specifically associated with radon exposure Radon is one of the most powerful carcinogens, particularly in terms of lung cancer onset and development. miRNAs may be considered not only as markers of the ongoing tumorigenesis but also as a hallmark of exposure to radiation, including radon and its progeny. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to estimate the value of plasma miR-19b-3p level as the prospective marker of the response to radon exposure in lung cancer pathogenesis. A total of 136 subjects were examined, including 49 radon-exposed patients with lung cancer, 37 patients with lung cancer without radon exposure and 50 age/sex matched healthy controls. Total RNA from blood samples was extracted and used to detect miR-19b-3p expression via reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction. The 2-DELTADELTACq method was used to quantify the amount of relative miRNA. The plasma level of p53 protein was determined using a Human p53 ELISA kit. Plasma miR-19b-3p level was significantly higher in the patients with lung cancer groups, compared with the healthy control group (P<0.0001). No other statistically significant differences were determined in the expression level of plasma miR-19b-3p between patients diagnosed with lung cancer exposed to radon and not exposed to radon. The expression level of free circulating miR-19b-3p was higher in the group of non-smoking patients with lung cancer, compared with smokers with lung cancer. The miR-19b-3p was 1.4-fold higher in non-smokers than in smokers (P<0.05). No association between plasma levels of p53 protein and miR-19b-3p freely circulating in patients with lung cancer was observed. No other statistically significant differences were determined in the plasma p53 protein level between patients diagnosed with lung cancer exposed and not exposed to radon. These results indicated that detection of miR-19b-3p levels in plasma potentially could be exploited as a noninvasive method for the lung cancer diagnostics. However, this miRNA is not suitable as the precise marker for radon impact.Copyright © 2018, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included,0.83428395
203,1441,"Solid cancer risk dependence on the Pasquill-Gifford atmospheric stability classes in a radiological event In a radiological event, the lack of preliminary information about the site of explosion and the difficulty in predicting the accurate path and distribution of radioactive plumes makes it difficult to predict expected health effects of exposed individuals. So far, in such a health evaluation, radiation-induced stochastic health effects such as cancer are not included. The Pasquill-Gifford atmospheric classes generally allow connecting atmospheric stability with dispersion of radioactive contaminants to the environment. In this work, an environmental release of radioactive Cs-137 was simulated and the resulting relative risk for solid cancer incidence among the affected population calculated. The HotSpot health physics code was used to simulate the radioactive atmospheric dispersion and calculate the Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE), which was then used to estimate the relative risk of cancer incidence. The main results from this work suggest that the relative cancer risk and atmospheric stability classes are linked by differences in the TEDE.

206,1444,"Rehabilitation program in secondary knee osteoarthritis with GENU recurvatum in hemi-paretic patients Background It is known that the knee is divided into 3 compartments: medial, lateral and femuro-patelar. The medial compartment is more exposed to stress due to the knee biomechanics where the weight of load is in biggest proportion. The hemi-paretic patient supports modified forces in the knee-joint due to the muscle spasticity, fact which determines a redistribution of forces, so that through quadriceps failure and gastrocnemian muscle spasticity it would generate genu recurvatum, with modified biomechanics and redistributed areasof taking weight, making a vicious circle. Objectives We propose to prevent the formation of genu recurvatum at patients who suffered a stroke with hemi-paresis and reduce the changes at those who have already developed these modifications. Methods There were 26 patients selected for this study (14 women and 12 men, all over 45 years old) with a 2-year-old stroke, with secondary developed knee osteoarthritis at hemi-paretic lower limb. The patients were evaluated both through muscular and joint tests as well as knee front and profile X-rays. These patients were divided in 2 study groups. Both groups followed a rehabilitation program - physiotherapy, peripheral magnetic stimulation on the muscle motor points -18 days, when we followed the toning of the failing muscles to correct the knee muscle balance: quadriceps and tibialis anterioris muscles - to counteract the gastrocnemianus muscle spasticity, correcting position of genu recurvatum and ankle orthotic. The patients of the Study Group A followed this program while being hospitalized - 18 days, repeated and adjusted at 3 months. The patients of Study Group B of followed this program for 6 months with adjustedkineticprogram, the magnetic stimulation being applied 10 days/month. The evaluation was also initially made at 6 months with joint testing scale, and VAS pain scale, the 6MWD (6 Minute Walking Distance test), the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index), and Ashworth spasticity testing scale (from 0 to 5). Results Group A did not obtain any improvement at the joint testing. The pain in the knee was reduced from 70.2 to 51.4 mm on VAS scale. The 6 MWD test made by moving with crutch recorded an average improvement of 15.6 m. The WOMAC scale recorded a score drop from 74.2 to 41.4. The Ashworth scale dropped from 3.5 to 3. Group B presented better results, a reduction of genu recurvatum observed and proved by the improvement with 5 degrees at the joint testing for extension. The VAS scale improved from 71.3 to 34.5. The 6 MWD test proved a growth in the walking capacity with 23.4 m. The WOMAC scale recorded a significant drop from 78.4 to 32.3, and Ashworth scale dropped from 3.6 to 2.7.

However, these modalities are lacking sufficient soft tissue visualization of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and the lingual nerve (LN), which is particularly exposed to injury during wisdom tooth removal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using dedicated imaging sequences showed promising results in the direct visualization of the IAN and the LN with high spatial resolution and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) quantification. The aim of this study was to define standard specifications in MRI which allow for benchmark definition of SNR values in healthy subjects. Method(s): 33 healthy volunteers were examined on a 3T scanner. The conducted sequence protocol consisted of a 3D STIR, 3D WATS and a 3D T1 FFE ""black bone""-sequence. Result(s): The study highlights the feasibility of a direct visualization of proximal and peripheral branches of the IAN and proximal LN. STIR and WATS sequences allowed for morphological discrimination of nerval and vascular components and their anatomical localization within the mandible. The STIR sequence showed significantly higher signalto-noise-ratios for IAN as well as for the LN in the proximal and distal part of the corresponding nerves (p < 0.05). Discussion(s): The data presented in this study reveal, that a direct visualization of the course of the IAN and LN is feasible using high resolution STIR and WATS sequences. Furthermore, the imaging protocol conducted not only allowed for reproducible nerve diameter measurements but also for subsequent calculation of quantitative parameters like aSNR.

We retrospectively reviewed 124 patients treated with Gamma Knife SRS from January 2018 to December 2019 at our institution using a mask-based immobilization system. Patient and treatment characteristics were collected and summarized as well as interfraction shifts and treatment-related outcomes. This dataset includes 124 patients with an associated 358 intracranial tumors. Twenty-four patients presented with primary brain tumors, which included 14 meningiomas and 10 other histologies, with 100 patients having brain metastases. Sixty tumors were post-operative, while 298 were intact. The median dose for primary tumors was 25 Gy in 5 fractions. Median doses to metastases were 20 Gy in 1 fraction, 27 Gy in 3 fractions, and 25 Gy in 5 fractions. Median interfraction CBCT shifts were submillimeter. Median patient follow-up was 6.28 months. 91% of patients with metastases maintained local control. Our early clinical experience has demonstrated limited toxicity profiles and high patient tolerance, which suggests that mask-based Gamma Knife SRS provides a safe alternative option for frameless SRS. Patients with large target volumes where fractionation is preferred or with small target volumes in non-eloquent areas can be considered for this approach. Response rates are encouraging, and continued follow-up is necessary to investigate long-term control and survival.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded,0.1704733

The purpose of the current study is to quantify patient and staff radiation exposure using DARCA on a modality already equipped with dose-reducing technology. Additionally, we assessed applicability of 1 dose area product to effective dose conversion factor for both DARCA and conventional coronary angiography (CCA) procedures. Methods and Results Twenty patients were examined using DARCA and were compared with 20 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched patients selected from a prior study using CCA on the same x-ray modality. All irradiation events are simulated using PCXMC (STUK, Finland) to determine organ and effective doses. Moreover, for DARCA each frame is simulated. Staff dose is measured using active personal dosimeters (DoseAware, Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands). With DARCA, median cumulative dose area product is reduced by 57% (ie, 7.41 versus 17.19 Gy.cm2). Effective dose conversion factors of CCA and DARCA are slightly different, yet this difference is not statistically significant. The occupational dose at physician's chest, leg, and collar level are reduced by 60%, 56%, and 16%, respectively, of which the first 2 reached statistical significance. Median effective dose is reduced from 4.75 mSv in CCA to 2.22 mSv in DARCA procedures, where the latter is further reduced to 1.79 mSv when excluding ventriculography. Conclusions During invasive coronary angiography, DARCA reduces radiation exposure even further toward low-dose values on a system already equipped with advanced image processing and noise reduction algorithms.

Method(s): We evaluated 123 United States Radiologic Technologists subjects who wore personal UVR dosimeters for 8 hours daily for up to 7 days (N = 837 days). Potential predictors of personal UVR derived from a self-administered questionnaire, and public databases that provided daily estimates of ambient UVR and weather conditions. Factors potentially related to personal UVR exposure were tested individually and in a model including all significant variables. Result(s): The strongest predictors of daily personal UVR exposure in the full model were ambient UVR, latitude, daily rainfall, and skin reaction to prolonged sunlight (R2 = 0.30). In a model containing only environmental and meteorological variables, ambient UVR, latitude, and daily rainfall were the strongest predictors of daily personal UVR exposure (R2 = 0.25). Conclusion(s): In the absence of feasible measures of individual longitudinal sun exposure history, stable personal characteristics, ambient UVR, and weather parameters may help estimate long-term personal UVR exposure.",Excluded,0.1757615
224,1462,"Increased Postoperative Use of Computed Tomography following Emergency Surgery for Ileocaecal Crohn Disease Multiple imaging modalities are often required for the relapsing nature of Crohn disease (CD). Computed tomography (CT) offers a rapid acquisition of images and shows high specificity and sensitivity. However, CT imaging exposes to a higher dose of ionizing radiation than other abdominal imaging modalities. The aim of this study was to compare the use of preoperative and postoperative CT scan in patients undergoing emergency and elective surgery for CD. Method(s):All patients undergoing emergency and elective surgery for ileocaecal CD January 2014 to December 2018 were included in this prospective observational study. The study objective was to evaluate the frequency of use of CT scan perioperatively with the number and findings of preoperative and postoperative CT being the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes were operating time, length of hospital stay, reoperations, and rehospitalization. Result(s):A total of 75 patients were included, 33 in the emergency group (43%) and 44 in the elective group (57%). There was a higher use of preoperative CT scan in the emergency surgery group, with 14 patients (42%) having a CT scan before surgery compared with 2 (5%) in the elective group (P=0.14). Thirteen patients (39.4%) had a postoperative CT scan in the emergency surgery group, compared with 10 patients (23.8%) in the elective surgery group. Conclusion(s):Patients undergoing emergency surgery for CD are at increased risk of exposure to ionizing radiations due to high perioperative use of CT scan.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

232,1470,"Scanning beyond anatomic limits of the thorax in chest CT: findings, radiation dose, and automatic tube current modulation OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine additional radiation dose associated with scanning beyond the anatomic limits of the thorax in chest CT protocol and to assess the effect of z-axis modulation on the additional radiation dose associated with the scanning protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ""Extra"" images for routine chest CT were defined as those above lung apices (supraapical) and those caudal to the lowermost portion of lung parenchyma (infrapulmonary), including images obtained beyond the adrenal glands (infraadrenal). One hundred and forty-eight consecutive chest CT examinations (70 men, 78 women; age range, 15-90 years) performed September 13-25, 2003, were reviewed to determine the number of supraapical, infrapulmonary, and infraadrenal extra images. All examinations were performed using z-axis modulation (n = 70) or fixed tube current (n = 78). The CT dose index volume and dose-length product (DLP) values for the extra images were calculated. Two radiologists reviewed these extra images for pathologic findings. Student's t test was used to perform the statistical analysis. RESULT(S): One hundred forty-four (97%) examinations had supraapical extra images and 145 (98%) had infrapulmonary extra images. A total of 31 additional findings were observed in extra images. Most clinically important findings were identified in patients with a history of malignancy. With z-axis modulation, the mean DLP for supraapical and infrapulmonary extra images was 39.98 mGy x cm and 132.59 mGy x cm, respectively. With fixed tube current, the mean DLP for supraapical and infrapulmonary extra images was 30.31 mGy x cm and 95.91 mGy x cm, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): A substantial number of extra images are acquired during chest CT that do not add clinically important information in patients with nonmalignant indications. The use of z-axis modulation increased radiation dose for the extra images.",Excluded,0.17159092
244,1482,"Imaging features of radiation-induced changes in the abdomen After external-beam radiation therapy, radiation-induced changes may be observed in abdominal and pelvic organs at imaging. In the liver, an area of low attenuation corresponding to the radiation port (or an area of hyperattenuation if the underlying liver tissue shows fatty change) can be seen at computed tomography (CT) performed within 3-6 months after therapy. Later, the liver may be fibrotic and contracted. In the stomach, small intestine, and colon, wall thickening and edema are early manifestations. Ulcers may also be observed. Long-term complications include strictures and fistulas. After irradiation of the kidneys, altered attenuation of the renal parenchyma may be seen at CT. Ureteral strictures, typically involving the distal ureter, may be observed after pelvic irradiation. The bladder may be small and contracted with a thickened wall after radiation exposure. Fistulas between the bladder and other pelvic organs sometimes occur. Typical musculoskeletal changes include growth abnormalities in skeletally immature patients, fatty replacement of bone marrow, and radiation osteitis. Radiation-induced neoplasms are also recognized after therapy.",Excluded,0.31502035
247,1485,"Navigated minimally invasive unilateral laminotomy with crossover for intraoperative prediction of outcome in degenerative lumbar stenosis Background: Different surgical techniques have been described for treatment of degenerative lumbar stenosis (DLS). Only postoperative measures have been identified as predictors of efficacy of decompression. The objective of this study is to assess the role of navigated unilateral laminotomy with crossover to achieve and predict a satisfying decompression and outcome in DLS. Material(s) and Method(s): We enrolled patients with DLS who underwent navigation-assisted unilateral laminotomy with crossover. The extent of decompression was evaluated during surgery using neuronavigation. The outcome was assessed through the Oswestry disability index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) for leg pain. Outcome correlation with the extent of the intraoperative bone decompression was analyzed. Finally, the outcome, surgical time, and in-hospital length-of-stay were compared with a control group treated through standard unilateral laminotomy. Result(s): Twenty-five patients were treated using the navigated technique (Group A), 25 using the standard unilateral laminotomy (Group B). In Group A, a cut-off value >=0.9 cm for bone decompression revealed to be an intraoperative predictor of good outcome, both regarding the ODI and VAS scores (P = 0.0005; P = 0.002). As compared with Group B, patients operated using the navigated technique showed similar operative times, in-hospital length-of-stay, ODI scores, but improved VAS scores for leg pain (P = 0.04). Conclusion(s): The intraoperative navigated evaluation of the bone decompression could predict the outcome allowing satisfactory results in unilateral laminotomy for DLS. The navigated technique also could lead to an improved decompression of lateral recesses resulting in better control of leg pain as compared to standard unilateral laminotomy.Copyright © 2018 Journal of Craniovertebral Junction and Spine Published by Wolters Kluwer -Medknow.",Excluded,0.17204125
250,1488,"Long-term hearing outcomes following stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma: Patterns of hearing loss and variables influencing audiometric decline Object. The goals of this retrospective cohort study were as follows: 1) to describe the long-term prevalence and timing of hearing deterioration following low-dose (12- to 13-Gy marginal dose) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for vestibular schwannoma (VS); and 2) to identify clinical variables associated with long-term preservation of useful hearing following treatment. Methods. Patients with serviceable hearing who underwent SRS for VS between 1997 and 2002 were studied. Data including radiosurgery treatment plans, tumor characteristics, pre- and posttreatment pure tone average, speech discrimination scores, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery hearing class were collected. Time to nonserviceable hearing was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate associations with time to nonserviceable hearing were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results. Forty-four patients met the study criteria and were included. The median duration of audiometric follow- up was 9.3 years. Thirty-six patients developed nonserviceable hearing at a mean of 4.2 years following SRS. The Kaplan-Meier estimated rates of serviceable hearing at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years following SRS were 80%, 55%, 48%, 38%, and 23%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that pretreatment ipsilateral pure tone average (p < 0.001) and tumor size (p = 0.009) were statistically significantly associated with time to nonserviceable hearing. Conclusions. Durable hearing preservation a decade after low-dose SRS for VS occurs in less than one-fourth of patients. Variables including preoperative hearing capacity and tumor size may be used to predict hearing outcomes following treatment. These findings may assist in pretreatment risk disclosure. Furthermore, these data demonstrate the importance of long-term follow-up when reporting audiometric outcomes following SRS for VS. © AANS, 2013.",Excluded,0.17999744
254,1492,"Lack of correlation between villus and crypt damage in irradiated mouse intestine It has been observed that scanning electron microscopy is a more sensitive indicator of mucosal damage at low radiation dose levels than conventional quantitative crypt counting techniques. Three different fractionation schedules were subjected to investigation by both of these methods to try to elucidate some features of irradiation damage to the whole of the intestinal mucosa, at dose levels commonly used in clinical practice. Despite variations in the qualitative observations, there was a marked difference in two of the schedules between damage expressed as crypt counts and that described by the qualitative techniques. In the first case high crypt numbers were associated with severe mucosal damage, whereas the second schedule produced a reduced crypt count in association with low damage to the surface mucosa. A third schedule produced results in which there was a general agreement between low crypt numbers and considerable surface mucosal damage. However, observations were made of mucosal formations not previously seen on damaged mucosal surfaces. These resembled the appearance normally associated with the gut of patients suffering from coeliac disease. Variations in the qualitative observations were seen in all the schedules so that their interpretation in terms of perturbation of cellular kinetics is difficult.",Included,0.90602076
255,1493,"Level of supervision and radiation exposure of senior orthopedic residents during surgical treatment of proximal femur fracture The sustained use of intraoperative fluoroscopy has led to increased use of minimally invasive surgical techniques, enhanced surgeon proficiency, improved anatomic corrections, reduced patient morbidity, earlier functional recovery, and decreased length of hospital stay. As a result, orthopedic attending surgeons and residents are exposed to more radiation, increasing the risk of cancer and radiation-induced cataracts compared with the general population and those who work in other surgical specialties. The magnitude of radiation exposure depends on the susceptibility of the tissues affected, medical specialty, the position of the C-arm, distance from the radiation beam, level of difficulty of the surgical procedure, surgeon experience, level of resident training, and level of supervision by the attending surgeon. However, little information is available on the effect of supervision level on radiation exposure for orthopedic senior residents. The goal of this study was to investigate whether level of supervision by the attending surgeon affects the radiation exposure of orthopedic senior residents during surgical treatment of proximal femur fracture with cephalomedullary nail fixation. This retrospective cohort study was performed from January 2019 to March 2019. No significant relationship between supervision level and radiation exposure of senior residents was observed. Supervision level does not significantly affect radiation exposure for senior residents; therefore, the implementation of standardized training in radiation safety may be a more essential measure to decrease radiation exposure.Copyright © 2021 Slack Incorporated.

256,1494,"A phase II trial of accelerated multimodality therapy for locoregionally advanced cancer of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction: The impact of clinical heterogeneity OBJECTIVES: This is a report of mature results from a phase II trial of an accelerated multimodality treatment program for locoregionally advanced cancer of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction with a focus on the impact of clinical heterogeneity on outcomes. A split course of pre- and postoperative hyperfractionated radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy was used in an effort to limit perioperative mortality. METHOD(S): Eligibility required a diagnosis of esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer and an esophageal ultrasound stage of at least T3, N1, or M1A. Patients received a 12-day induction course of radiation (1.5 Gy twice a dose to a dose of 30 Gy) concurrent with 4-day continuous intravenous infusions of cisplatin (20 mg/m per day) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m per day) beginning on day 1. Surgery followed in 4 to 6 weeks followed 6 to 10 weeks later by a second, identical course of chemoradiotherapy. RESULT(S): From October 1999 through March 2003, 93 patients were enrolled; 96% were white, 86% male, and 83% had adenocarcinoma. Resection was possible in 83 patients (89%) with 4 (5%) perioperative deaths. With a median follow up of 50 months (range, 34-72 months), the 3-year projected overall survival rate is 27.9%, freedom from recurrence 30.5%, and distant metastatic control 32.4%. Locoregional control in resected patients is 86%. Freedom from recurrence and distant control were significantly better in patients with 1) earlier pretreatment clinical stage, 2) earlier postinduction pathologic stage, 3) squamous cell cancer, and 4) a pathologic response. CONCLUSION(S): This accelerated multimodality treatment program is feasible and perioperative mortality proved acceptable. Despite excellent locoregional control, freedom from recurrence, and overall survival proved disappointing reflecting the frequency of distant metastases. Heterogeneity in patient populations makes comparisons with similar nonrandomized experiences problematic. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",Excluded,0.17261235

272,1510,"Pulmonary resection after high-dose and low-dose chest irradiation BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of pulmonary resection after low and high dose neoadjuvant radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using an electronic prospective database from January 1998 to August 2004. All patients had N2, stage IIIa, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and received neoadjuvant carboplatinum-based chemotherapy with similar doses. In addition, some patients received high-dose chest radiation (HD) equal to or greater than 60 Gy and were compared with those who received low-dose radiation (LD) less than 60 Gy. All bronchial stumps were buttressed with an intercostal muscle., RESULTS: There were 104 patients, 50 in the LD group and 54 patients in the HD group. Median dose of radiation was 45 Gy (range 35-50.4) in the LD group and 60 Gy (range 60-66.7) in the HD group. Complete pathologic response rate was 10% compared to 28% favoring the HD group (p = 0.04). Median length of stay for both groups was 4 days and the ICU was avoided in 74%. Major morbidity and mortality rates were similar: 8% compared to 9% and 2% compared to 3.7% for the low and high dose groups, respectively. Pneumonectomy was a significant risk factor for morbidity (OR = 17.0)., CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary resection after preoperative chest radiation is safe even after 60 Gy or higher. Sixty or higher may afford an increase in complete pathologic response and it does not seem to increase morbidity or mortality. However, if pneumonectomy is known to be required we prefer to avoid neoadjuvant radiotherapy and use chemotherapy alone.",Excluded,0.17302883

Method(s): Seventy consecutive patients with Stage I-II (23%) or III/IV (77%) HNC treated by definitive IMRT were included. For all LR failure patients, the FDG-PET and CT scans documenting recurrence were rigidly registered to the initial treatment planning CT. Failure volumes (Vf) were delineated based on clinical, radiological, and histological data. The percentage of Vf covered by 95% of the prescription isodose (Vf-V95) was analyzed. Failures were classified as "" in-field"" if Vf-V95 >= 95%, "" marginal"" if 20% < Vf-V95 < 95%, and "" out-of-field"" if Vf-V95 <=20%. Correlation between Vf-V95 and mean doses (Dmean) in the PG, SMG, and OC was assessed using Spearman's rank-order correlation test. The salivary gland dose impact on the LR recurrence risk was assessed by Cox analysis. Result(s): The median follow-up was 20 months (6-35). Contralateral and ipsilateral PGs were spared in 98% and 54% of patients, respectively, and contralateral and ipsilateral SMG in 26% and 7%, respectively. The OC was spared to a dose <=40 Gy in 26 patients (37%). The 2-year LR control rate was 76.5%. One recurrence was "" marginal"" , and 12 were "" in-field"" No recurrence was observed in vicinity of spared structures. Vf-V95 was not significantly correlated with Dmean in PG, SMG, and OC. The LR recurrence risk was not increased by lower Dmean in the salivary glands, but by T (p = 0.04) and N stages (p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): Over 92% of LR failures occurred "" in-field"" within the high dose region when using IMRT with a whole salivary gland-sparing strategy.

This phase II trial was designed to determine the safety of accelerated fraction radiotherapy (AFRT) with capecitabine in patients with BR pancreatic cancer. Method(s): The patients had newly diagnosed BR adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and normal organ function. Intensity-modulated (n = 11) or 3D conformal (n = 2) radiotherapy was given to a dose of 50 Gy in 2.5-Gy fractions with capecitabine 825 mg/m2 twice on radiation days. The primary outcome was the frequency of severe treatment-related adverse events (AEs). The study was stopped before planned interim analysis because of 2 severe (grades 4 and 5) gastric ulcerations. Result(s): Thirteen patients were enrolled with a median age of 66 years. All patients completed treatment. Seven (54%) experienced grade 3+ treatment-related AEs. Severe gastric ulceration occurred in 2 patients despite receipt of >=43 Gy to only 1% (2-3 cm3) of the stomach. Lymphopenia (n = 7) was the only other severe AE that occurred in >1 patient. In 7 of the 13 patients, disease had progressed outside the pancreas at restaging. Five of the 13 underwent resection, and all had >10% viable tumor. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.4 months (95% CI 1.9-5.9), and median survival was 9.1 months (95% CI 5.9-not reached). Among those who underwent resection, median PFS was 13.0 months (95% CI 4.4-not reached). Median survival was not reached. Conclusion(s): Given the limited efficacy signal and severe gastric ulcerations, we do not recommend this regimen for pancreatic cancer. We also do not recommend the use of high doses per fraction outside a clinical trial. © 2014 by International Society of Gastrointestinal Oncology.",Excluded,0.17118646

We report the safety, biodistribution, and internal radiation dosimetry profiles of (18)F-ICMT-11 in 8 healthy human volunteers., METHODS: (18)F-ICMT-11 was intravenously administered as a bolus injection (mean +/- SD, 159 +/- 2.75 MBq; range, 154-161 MBq) to 8 healthy volunteers (4 men, 4 women). Whole-body (vertex to mid thigh) PET/CT scans were acquired at 6 time points, up to 4 h after tracer injection. Serial whole blood, plasma, and urine samples were collected for radioactivity measurement and radiotracer stability. In vivo (18)F activities were determined from quantitative analysis of the images, and time-activity curves were generated.

Initial reports from our institution demonstrated that the reduction of treatment dose to 46.8 Gy resulted in improved preservation of functional hearing status. Objective(s): We now report the tumor control (TC), symptomatic outcome, and hearing preservation (HP) rate in patients treated with reduced-dose FSRT. Method(s): We analyzed all patients with AN treated from 2002 to 2011. All patients received 46.8 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions. Follow-up audiogram and magnetic resonance imaging were performed in <=1-year intervals. TC and HP were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Analysis of HP, defined as Gardner-Robertson value <=2, was determined by audiometric data. Non-hearing-related symptoms were defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. Result(s): In total, 154 patients were analyzed. At a median follow-up of 35 months (range, 4-108), TC was achieved in 96% of patients (n = 148/154) and at 3 and 5 years was 99% and 93%. Eighty-seven patients had serviceable hearing at the time of FSRT and evaluable audiometric follow-up. Overall HP was 67% and at 3 and 5 years was 66% and 54%. Pure tone average decreased by a median of 13 dB in all patients. Nineteen percent (n = 31) of patients experienced symptom improvement, and 8% (n = 13) had worsening of symptoms. Cranial nerve dysfunction occurred in 3.8% of patients (n = 6). Conclusion(s): Reduced-dose FSRT to 46.8 Gy for AN achieves excellent functional HP rates and limited toxicity without compromising long-term TC. Based on these promising outcomes, further attempts at dose deescalation may be warranted. © 2013 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",Excluded,0.17275761
283,1521,"Fragility fracture and osteoarthritis: Interaction between bone mineral and bone mass index Increased bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mass index (BMI) are associate with increased risk of osteoarthritis (OA) and reduced risk of fragility fracture. However, little is known about the relationship between fragility fracture and osteoarthritis. In this study, we sought to examine the interactions between BMD and BMI in the determination of the OA-fracture relationship. The study was part of the on-going Dubbo Osteoporosis Epidemiology Study, which involved 2,412 women and 1,452 men aged between 46 to 99 years. The individuals had been followed up for a median of 7 years (range: 0.1 to 21 years). Baseline BMD was measured at femoral neck (FNBMD) and lumbar spine (LSBMD) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (GE-Lunar, Madison, WI). Osteoarthritis was ascertained by self-report. The incidence of fragility fracture was ascertained by X-ray report during the follow-up period. In addition, data concerning demographic characteristics, clinical history, and lifestyle factors were obtained by a structured questionnaire. A total of 1,077 participants (691 women and 386 men) had reported a diagnosis of OA. Overall, the risk of OA was associated significantly with increased LSBMD in men (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95%CI, 1.19-1.52) and women (1.20; 1.09-1.32). Elevation in FNBMD was significantly associated with increased risk of OA in men (OR 1.16; 1.02-1.32), but not in women. When stratified by BMI, significant association remained between OA risk and high LSBMD amongst women with BMI < 25kg/m2 (OR 1.26; 1.07-1.47) and BMI >30kg/m2 (1.26; 1.05-1.51); and in men with BMI < 25kg/m2 (OR 1.75; 1.37-2.27) or BMI 25-30kg/m2 (1.21; 1.02-1.43). OA was associated with an increased risk of fracture. After adjusting for LSBMD women with OA had significant increased fracture risk (1.41; 1.16-1.72); however, the association was not significant in men (OR 0.96; 0.69-1.32). Moreover, the association between OA and fracture risk was particularly pronounced in women with BMI 25-30kg/m2 (OR 1.45; 1.05-1.99, adjusted for LSBMD).These data suggest that high BMD is associated with a greater risk of OA in both men and women, particularly those with low BMI. The results also suggest that BMD could be a useful measure for identifying individuals at high risk of OA, particularly among those at lower BMI spectrum. Despite having higher bone density, women with self-reported OA, especially those overweight, have an increased risk of fragility fracture, suggesting that the OA-fracture association is mediated via non-BMD factors.",Excluded,0.18625043

286,1524,"Effects of irradiation on nasal mucociliary clearance in head and neck cancer patients A prospective longitudinal study was conducted on fifty patients of histopathologically confirmed head and neck cancer with the main aim to assess the nasal mucociliary clearance, pre- and post-irradiation; and to compare the findings with the healthy non-irradiated age and sex-matched controls. All the patients underwent saccharin particle test for nasal mucociliary clearance before commencement of radiation therapy and again within 6 months of completion of radiation therapy. The difference between the saccharin perception times of nasal mucosa in the healthy non-irradiated controls and the pre-irradiated head and neck cancer patients were statistically insignificant (P> 0.05). But, the difference between the saccharin perception times of nasal mucosa in the pre- and post-irradiated head and neck cancer patients was found to be statistically significant (P=0).

287,1525,"Breast conservation in early and locally advanced breast cancer: Regional cancer centre, JIPMER experience Introduction and Objectives: Breast preservation is the standard care for early breast cancer. The therapeutic challenges of locally advanced stage are well recognized, especially increased risk of local recurrence. However, with introduction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), significant tumour regression is achieved, thereby permitting breast conservation, hence a non-randomized single arm study was conducted. Material(s) and Method(s): From 2007 to 2014 one hundred & ten patients were recruited. 59 out of 110 underwent NACT. All underwent lumpectomy and axillary dissection & intraoperatively template guided rigid/flexible needle with 2 or 3 plane. After 2D/3D based CT - planning, HDR dose of 15-16 Gy/2 - 2.5 Gy/# BD given for 3-5 days. Whole breast irradiation (46-50 Gy) was delivered after a 2-3 weeks' gap. CTV & DHI parameters were studied. Acute skin toxicity assessed at end of treatment. Cosmetic assessment done at 3 months according to Harvard scale. Unpaired t and Chi-square tests were used for analysis of parameters. Result(s): The ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence rate was (5) 4.5% with median follow up 5.4 years. Mean D90 (91.5%) and V90 (90.7%). Mean V100 was 84.20%. DHI range 0.7-0.8. The ipsilateral breast except the CTV (Breast-CTV) received a mean dose of 33.2%. Mean dose received by heart was 7.2%. Mean dose received by contralateral breast was (V5%) 1.6% & (V10%) 0.08%. Mean dose received by ipsilateral lung was (V5%) 46% & 18% (V10%). Mean dose to skin is significantly 24.9% brachytherapy. Excellent/good overall cosmesis is observed in 69 patients and fair/poor cosmesis observed in 32 patients. Poor cosmesis was observed in 9 patients. Conclusion(s): Breast conservation treatment options show comparable local control with acceptable dosimetric parameters & cosmetic outcomes even in LABC. With careful patient selection, optimal treatment planning, and careful attention to excision margins & radiation doses, breast conservation can be performed in these patients without sacrificing local control of disease.",Excluded,0.17138495
289,1527,"DNA damage and repair: fruit and vegetable effects in a feeding trial Epidemiologic studies have examined the association between fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption and the risk of cancer. Several cancer-preventive mechanisms have been proposed, such as antioxidant properties and modulation of biotransformation enzyme activities; both may be associated with reducing DNA damage and hence the mutation rate. We investigated, in a randomized, controlled, crossover feeding trial, the effect of 10 servings/day of botanically defined F&V for 2 wk on endogenous DNA damage; resistance to gamma -irradiation damage; and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes, measured by the Comet assay. We also explored the association between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and serum bilirubin concentrations and DNA damage and repair measures. Healthy men (n = 11) and women (n = 17), age 20 to 40 yr, provided blood samples at the end of each feeding period. Overall, F&V did not affect DNA damage and repair measures in lymphocytes. The number of UGT1A1*28 alleles was inversely associated with sensitivity to gamma -irradiation exposure and DNA repair capacity, but a biological mechanism to explain this association is unclear. A larger sample size is needed to investigate the association between bilirubin concentrations and endogenous DNA damage. With inconsistent findings in the literature, additional dietary intervention studies on the effect of F&V on DNA damage and repair are needed.",Excluded,0.20207514
291,1529,"Preoperative chemoradiotherapy effects on anastomotic leakage after rectal cancer resection: A propensity score matching analysis OBJECTIVE:: To assess the effects of preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) on anastomotic leakage (AL) after rectal cancer resection, using propensity score matching. BACKGROUND:: Conflicting data have emerged over the last decade regarding the effect of preoperative CRT on AL. METHOD(S):: We reviewed 1437 consecutive patients with rectal cancer who underwent low anterior resection (LAR) at our institution between 2005 and 2012. AL evaluated as grade C was the primary endpoint, as proposed by the International Study Group of Rectal Cancer in 2010. The patients were treated with (n = 360) or without (n = 1077) preoperative CRT. The total radiation dose was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Multivariate and propensity score matching analyses were used to compensate for the differences in some baseline characteristics. RESULT(S):: The preoperative CRT group contained more patients with the following characteristics, older age, male sex, smoker, advanced stage tumor, lower/mid rectal tumor location, ultra-LAR, and diverting stoma, than the non-preoperative CRT group (all Ps < 0.05). Postoperative AL occurred in 91 patients (6.3%). Before propensity score matching, the incidence of AL in patients with or without preoperative CRT was 7.5% and 5.9%, respectively (P = 0.293). After propensity score matching, the 2 groups were nearly balanced except for the initial stage and the length of the surgeonE's career, and the incidence of AL in patients with or without preoperative CRT was 7.5% and 8.1%, respectively (P = 0.781).

294,1532,"Comparison of ultrasound-assisted and pure fluoroscopy-guided extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy for renal stones Background: In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and clinical outcomes of shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) for patients with renal stones using pure fluoroscopy (FS) or ultrasound-assisted (USa) localization with two lithotripters. Method(s): We retrospectively identified 425 patients with renal calculi who underwent SWL with either a LiteMed LM-9200 ELMA lithotripter (209 cases), which combined ultrasound and fluoroscopic stone targeting or a Medispec EM-1000 lithotripter machine (216 cases), which used fluoroscopy for stone localization and tracking. The patient demographic data, stone-free rates, stone disintegration rates, retreatment rates and complication rates were analyzed. Result(s): The USa group had a significantly higher overall stone-free rate (43.6 vs. 28.2%, p < 0.001) and stone disintegration rate (85.6 vs. 64.3%, p < 0.001), as well as a significantly lower retreatment rate (14.8 vs. 35.6%, p < 0.001) and complication rate (1.9 vs. 5.5%, p = 0.031) compared with the FS group. This superiority remained significant in the stone size < 1 cm stratified group. In the stone size > 1 cm group, the stone-free rate (32.4 vs. 17.8%, p = 0.028), disintegration rate (89.2 vs. 54.8%, p = 0.031) and retreatment rate (21.6 vs. 53.4%, p < 0.001) were still significantly better in the USa group, however there was no significant difference in the complication rate. The most common complication was post-SWL-related flank pain. Conclusion(s): SWL is a safe and non-invasive way of treating renal stones. This study compared two electromagnetic shock wave machines with different stone tracking systems. LiteMed LM-9200 ELMA lithotripter, which combined ultrasound and fluoroscopic stone targeting outperformed Medispec EM-1000 lithotripter, which used fluoroscopy for stone localization and tracking, with better stone-free rates and disintegration rates, as well as lower retreatment rates and complications with possible reduced radiation exposure.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.1720636

This study evaluates disease characteristics and treatment outcomes in oropharynx SCC in patients with and without immunosuppression. Method(s): A retrospective review of all patients treated with radiotherapy for oropharynx SCC at BC Cancer from 2011 to 2016 was performed. Survival outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods and competing risk analysis. Multivariate analysis and propensity score matching were performed. Result(s): There were 1077 patients, of which 5.8% (n = 62) had an immunosuppressive medical condition or were taking long-term immunosuppressive medication at diagnosis. Median follow-up was 3.3 years. Three year OS for patients without immunosuppression was 79.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 76.8-82.0%) and for those with immunosuppression was 64.6% (95% CI 50.9-75.3%) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.78, 95% CI 1.18-2.68, p = 0.0062). The three year disease recurrence for patients without immunosuppression was 24.9% (95% CI 22.2-27.7%) and 44.4% (95% CI 31.5-56.6%) for those with immunosuppression (HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.45-3.11, p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis of disease free survival (DFS) found that active smoking, advanced TNM stage, base of tongue subsite, p16 negative and unknown, no concurrent chemotherapy, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, and lower radiation dose were also associated with worse DFS (all p < 0.05). Immunosuppressed patients had worse DFS relative to patients without immunosuppression, p < 0.001, HR 1.97 (95% CI 1.33-2.91).

Method(s): Patient charts from consecutive patients with MSCC who were treated with radiotherapy alone at either an onsite hospital radiation department (from 2008 to 2012) or an offsite radiotherapy centre (2012-2015) were reviewed. Patient clinical parameters were compared across groups with either the chi2 test or Fisher's exact test, while survival curves were compared with the log-rank test. The primary end points were ambulatory rate over time, overall survival and cancer-specific survival. Result(s): A total of 45 patients were identified, with 19 patients treated onsite in the hospital department and 26 patients treated at the offsite radiotherapy centre with median follow-up of 42 days vs 48.5 days, respectively. The ambulatory rate over time, overall survival and cancer-specific survival were not significantly different between the two eras. Patients treated in-hospital were more likely to start treatment the same day as the consult (""sim and treat"") (79% vs 27%, p = 0.006) and were more likely to not complete treatment (26% vs 4%, p = 0.029) as compared with those treated in the offsite centre. Conclusion(s): Patients with MSCC can be feasibly treated at an offsite radiotherapy centre with outcomes similar to those treated in-hospital.

306,1544,"Brachial plexus-associated neuropathy after high-dose radiation therapy for head-and-neck cancer PURPOSE: To identify clinical and treatment-related predictors of brachial plexus-associated neuropathies after radiation therapy for head-and-neck cancer., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three hundred thirty patients who had previously completed radiation therapy for head-and-neck cancer were prospectively screened using a standardized instrument for symptoms of neuropathy thought to be related to brachial plexus injury. All patients were disease-free at the time of screening. The median time from completion of radiation therapy was 56 months (range, 6-135 months). One-hundred fifty-five patients (47%) were treated by definitive radiation therapy, and 175 (53%) were treated postoperatively. Radiation doses ranged from 50 to 74 Gy (median, 66 Gy). Intensity-modulated radiation therapy was used in 62% of cases, and 133 patients (40%) received concurrent chemotherapy., RESULTS: Forty patients (12%) reported neuropathic symptoms, with the most common being ipsilateral pain (50%), numbness/tingling (40%), motor weakness, and/or muscle atrophy (25%). When patients with <5 years of follow-up were excluded, the rate of positive symptoms increased to 22%. On univariate analysis, the following factors were significantly associated with brachial plexus symptoms: prior neck dissection (p = 0.01), concurrent chemotherapy (p = 0.01), and radiation maximum dose (p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis confirmed that both neck dissection (p < 0.001) and radiation maximum dose (p < 0.001) were independently predictive of symptoms., CONCLUSION: The incidence of brachial plexus-associated neuropathies after radiation therapy for head-and-neck cancer may be underreported. In view of the dose-response relationship identified, limiting radiation dose to the brachial plexus should be considered when possible. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, given increased cancer risk associated with ionizing radiation exposure, our purpose is to evaluate the utility of routine scans for these patients., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series., SETTING: Houston, Texas., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A 5-year review of patients with VFMI diagnosed at an academic institution was conducted. For patients without an apparent cause (eg, recent head, neck, or cardiothoracic surgery or known malignancy), CT head/neck and chest was performed to evaluate the recurrent laryngeal nerve course. Data included demographics, symptoms, radiography, and interventions. Statistical analyses were performed via chi(2) analysis., RESULTS: Of 406 patients with VFMI, 47 (11%) patients had no apparent cause clinically. Routine CT revealed abnormalities in 10 (21%) patients, of which only 3 (6%) could account for VFMI: benign thyroid adenoma (1), papillary thyroid cancer (1), and an esophageal mass (1). The most common lesion detected involved the thyroid. Demographic data and symptom type were not significantly associated with detection of a VFMI-attributable lesion on CT. Overall, routine CT did not identify a focal etiology in 94% patients with VFMI without an apparent cause., CONCLUSION: Routine pan-CT evaluation failed to reveal an etiology in 94% of patients with VFMI without an apparent cause. Patients may be subjected to health risks associated with radiation exposure without significant diagnostic benefit. Further studies should consider more judicious use of CT in the context of risk factors and safer imaging modalities as the initial diagnostic step.

Method(s):This is a retrospective analysis of 54 NPC patients with local recurrence re-irradiated with IMRT. The re-staging for rT1, rT2, rT3, rT4 were 3 (5.6%), 8 (14.8%), 9 (16.7%), 34 (63%) respectively. The average dose to GTV was 69.95 Gy (49.8-76.58 Gy), the average BED3Gy was 116.8 Gy (83.5-127.9 Gy). V95 was 96%, and D95 was 65.75Gy. 33.3% of them received concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Result(s):Median overall survival (OS) was 21 months (1-93 mon). The 1-, 2-year local progression free survival (LPFS) rate was 84.5%, 64% and OS rate was 71.7%, 44.3%. Severe late adverse events (SLAE) occurred in 48.1% of patients, including 31.5% with ulcer or necrosis of the nasopharyngeal mucosa, 20.4% with difficulty in feeding, 18.5% with temporal lobe necrosis, 11.1% with massive hemorrhage. 15.4% died of local regional progression, 5.8% died of distant metastasis, 25% died of SLAE, 9.6% died of both local regional progression and SLAE that could not be differentiated, 5.8% died of other medical complications. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy was the independent negative prognostic factors for LPFS; PTV>100 ml was a predictive factor of poor OS; patients with invasion of post-styloid space were at higher risk of SLAE. Conclusion(s):The present study demonstrated that IMRT with 70Gy was efficient for local tumor control. However, we observed a high frequency of serious late complications. More optimized combination treatment and patient selection are required to achieve excellent local control without significant late morbidities in locally recurrent NPC. © 2013 Chen et al.",Excluded,0.17318474

Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a retrospective study of eight patients who had pathological humeral shaft fractures. All fractures were stabilized with ante-grade intramedullary nailing and wide resection of the tumor. Bone defects were filled with polymethylmethacrylate cement augmentation. Result(s): The mean operative time for the procedure was 160 min (range, 120-190 min), and the mean duration of hospitalization was 10.5 days (range, 5-15 days). Relief of pain was rated as good to excellent. There were no wound problems, deep infections, nerve palsies, or implant failures observed. X-ray studies demonstrated the improved stability of the humerus. Conclusion(s): Interlocking intramedullary nailing for pathological humeral shaft fractures provides immediate stability and can be accomplished with wide resection of tumor and bone defect augmentation with cement.

This study aimed to determine the accuracy and safety of the ""blunt end"" Kirschner wire (KW) technique for the minimally invasive treatment of unstable pelvic fractures with the assistance of a 3D printed external template. Methods. Clinical data of 28 patients with unstable pelvic fractures between January 2016 and January 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 6 cases of B1, 10 of B2, 8 of C1, and 4 of C2 fractures, all of which received surgical treatment. The ""blunt end"" KW technique with a 3D template was adopted for the minimally invasive placement of the iliosacral (IS) or superior ramus screws. The number of intraoperative fluoroscopies, surgical time, and complications were recorded. Postoperative reduction was assessed using the Matta criteria, and the Majeed score system was used to evaluate postoperative functional recovery. Results. The average number of fluoroscopies was 35 per patient, and the average surgical time was 85.2 min. A total of 19 S1 and 28 S2 IS screws were inserted. Eleven antegrade superior ramus screws and 4 retrograde screws were placed in 11 patients, and anterior subcutaneous internal fixation (INFIX) was used to fix the anterior pelvic ring in 17 patients. All patients were followed up for an average of 18 months. Postoperative reduction was evaluated by Matta's criteria: Excellent in 16 cases, good in 9 cases, and fair in 3 cases. The Majeed score was used in the last follow-up to evaluate functional recovery: Excellent in 13 cases, good in 10 cases, fair in 4 cases, and poor in 1 case. There were no cases of operative vascular injury. Conclusion. The ""blunt end"" KW technique with a 3D printed external template is a safe and effective method for the placement of IS and superior ramus screws in unstable pelvic fractures with minimized surgical duration and radiation exposure.Copyright © 2019 Kaifang Chen et al.",Excluded,0.17177604
319,1557,"Differences in acupuncture point SP-10 and non-acupuncture point following subcutaneous injection of Tc-99m pertechnetate A new method of radionuclide venography, namely SC-RNV, by subcutaneous injection of Tc-99m pertechnetate at acupuncture points was recently developed in our laboratory. The time-activity curve of SC-RNV can be divided into 3 phases as: the phase of diffusion of radioisotopes through the subcutaneous space, the phase of entrance of radioisotopes into intravascular space to reach a peak concentration and the phase of equilibrium state of radioisotopes in the intravascular space. In this study, we used the 3 phases of SC-RNV to evaluate the absorption of Tc-99m pertechnetate injected subcutaneously in the acupuncture point SP-10 (Xuehai) and in a non-acupuncture point near SP-10. The results revealed that the absorption of Tc-99m pertechnetate via SP-10 was significantly greater than that of non-acupuncture point, evidenced by shorter phase 1, higher peak activity and greater accelerating rate of phase 2. This suggests that the absorption of radioisotopes from acupuncture point is faster and greater than that of non-acupuncture point.",Excluded,0.17776941

And on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th day after radiation, SD rats were euthanatized to take brain tissue for the detection of calcium, redox status and cell apoptosis, as well as the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1., RESULTS: The results indicated that magnesium treatment may alleviate the elevation of calcium and enhance redox status through increasing the activities of superoxide dimutase (SOD) and myeloperodase (MPO), and decreasing the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). Tunnel and immunohistochemistry assay suggested that treatment with magnesium decreased the apoptosis rate of brain cells and the expressions of caspase-3, respectively. Decline of the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 protein was observed after the treatment of magnesium., CONCLUSION: All the results demonstrated that magnesium may elicit protective effect against radiationinduced brain injury by reducing calcium overload, improving redox and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Moreover, magnesium significantly down-regulated the protein or mRNA levels of NF-kappaB and ICAM- 1. The findings may provide references for the application of magnesium in clinic for brain injury induced by radiation.

322,1560,"Radiation-induced oscillopsia in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients PURPOSE: To apply a battery of audiovestibular function tests and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the causes of oscillopsia in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients after irradiation (RT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Of 300 NPC patients, 12 (4%) developed oscillopsia after RT. The mean accumulated radiation dose to the nasopharynx was 112 +/- 30 Gy. Each patient underwent a battery of audiovestibular function tests, including audiometry and the dynamic illegible E, caloric, and rotational tests., RESULTS: Excluding 3 patients with neck fibrosis who could not perform the head turning movement, the remaining 9 patients displayed 100% abnormal dynamic illegible E test results and 100% abnormal refixation saccades. All 12 patients presented with bilateral hearing loss, caloric reductions, and reduced gains of the vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) on the rotational test, indicating bilateral VOR loss. After excluding tumor relapse and radiation necrosis of the brain by MRI, the oscillopsia in these 12 irradiated NPC patients was attributed to bilateral VOR loss., CONCLUSION: Radiation-induced oscillopsia in our NPC patients was attributed to bilateral VOR loss, possibly as a result of higher radiation doses. Hence, the therapeutic benefits of a second course of RT are associated with the potential risk of oscillopsia after RT.",Excluded,0.3074258
324,1562,"Neuropsychological function in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy A neuropsychological test battery was administered to 27 adult patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who had received radiotherapy, 28 adult patients with NPC awaiting radiotherapy, and 35 normal adult controls. The 27 patients with radiotherapy had a conventional dosage, 220 cGy per fraction, or less. The median interval between the completion of radiotherapy and the evaluation of neuropsychological function was 1.7 years. Groups were matched for age and educational level. The results showed that our NPC group with radiotherapy had neuropsychological impairments in the areas of auditory attention/concentration, immediate and delayed verbal recall and immediate visual recall, and recent memory, higher-order visuospatial abilities, and bimanual dexterity. Thus neuropsychological dysfunction may occur in patients with NPC within the first 2 years after radiotherapy.",Included,0.92629665
325,1563,"Injectable bone graft for the repair of nonunion of midshaft clavicular fracture after internal fixation BACKGROUND: Treatment of nonunion of clavicular fractures usually requires the insertion of bone material to facilitate bone healing. Injectable bone grafts have been successfully used in the treatment of limb fractures and lumbar fusion. However, there are few studies on its use in the treatment of nonunion. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the clinical effect of injection bone graft in the treatment of nonunion of clavicle fracture after internal fixation. METHOD(S): Totally 13 patients (9 males and 4 females aged 19-54 years old) with nonunion after internal fixation of clavicular fractures in the middle segment of the clavicle, who were treated in the No. 908 Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of Chinese PLA from January 2015 to December 2016, were selected. All of them were treated with ALLOMATRIX injection bone graft. Postoperative follow-up was conducted for 12 months. The fracture healing quality was evaluated by Lane-Sandhu X-ray score, and the shoulder joint function was evaluated by Constant score. This experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of No. 908 Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of Chinese PLA. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): (1) All the 13 patients received osseous healing, which lasted 8-16 weeks, and no complications such as infection, dislocation, or fixator loosening occurred. (2) The total Lane-Sandhu X-ray score of 13 patients at 3 months and the last follow-up was higher than that before the operation (P < 0. 05). (3) The total Constant score of shoulder joint function in 13 patients was higher than that before surgery at 3 months after surgery and at the last follow-up (P < 0. 05). (4) The results showed that ALLOMATRIX injection bone graft could be used to treat clavicular nonunion.Copyright © 2020, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

327,1565,"BMI1-KLF4 axis deficiency improves responses to neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer Purpose: Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is a gold standard treatment for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI1) is a member of the polycomb group of proteins that are involved in regulating gene expression. High levels of BMI1 have been demonstrated to contribute to the malignant phenotypes of several cancers; however, its relevance in rectal cancer treated with CCRT is largely unknown. Methods and materials: We used two patient cohorts to address the clinical relevance of BMI1 in human cancers. In addition, HT-29 and HCT-116 cells were chosen as our in vitro models to verify the role of BMI1 in cell response to ionizing radiation. Stemness-related proteins were analyzed by western blotting and cell survival was determined using clonogenic assays. Result(s): BMI1 overexpression was found to significantly correlate with advanced pre-treatment nodal status (N1-N2; p < 0.001), post-treatment tumor stage (T1-T2; p = 0.015), inferior tumor regression grade (p = 0.001), and also an independent prognosis factor in 172 rectal cancer patients receiving CCRT. Serial cell-based functional examination indicated that BMI1 deficiency sensitized cells to radiation treatment by modulating the gene expression of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and enhanced radiosensitivity in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancers. Overexpression of KLF4 partially overcame BMI1-deficiency-mediated gamma-H2AX expression after ionizing radiation exposure. Consistent with in vitro data, an analysis of an additional 30 rectal cancer tissue specimens revealed a positive correlation between BMI1 and KLF4 (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Higher levels of BMI1 are associated with poor therapeutic response and adverse outcomes in rectal cancer patients receiving CCRT.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.9147723
329,1567,"Diffusion tensor imaging study on radiation-induced brain injury in nasopharyngeal carcinoma during and after radiotherapy AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to monitor the mircostructure change of temporal lobe during the acute and subacute stage of radiation-induced brain injury using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients., METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Eighty patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and treated with the first radiotherapy from July 2010 to May 2012 were enrolled. Routine brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DTI were conducted in all patients before and during radiotherapy (radiation dose was 20, 40, and 60 Gy, respectively). The MRI and DTI were also performed in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd month after radiotherapy in 47 cases of 80 patients. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of DTI during different stages were dynamically observed and analyzed., RESULTS: The ADC values were increased and the FA values were decreased with the increase of radiation dose (20, 40, and 60 Gy) during the radiotherapy, but there was no significant difference in ADC value or FA value between before and during radiotherapy (p>0.05). Compared with before radiotherapy, the ADC values were significantly increased and the FA values were significantly decreased at the 1st month, 2nd month, and 3rd month after radiotherapy (all p<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging reflects the microstructure change of radiation-induced brain injury in the acute and subacute stage, which provides an objective basis for early intervention of potential irreversible brain injury in the late delayed stage, and has important significance for improving the overall efficacy of radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.6112343
331,1569,"Early stage transplantation of bone marrow cells markedly ameliorates copper metabolism and restores liver function in a mouse model of Wilson disease Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that normal bone marrow (BM) cells transplantation can correct liver injury in a mouse model of Wilson disease (WD). However, it still remains unknown when BM cells transplantation should be administered. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential impact of normal BM cells transplantation at different stages of WD to correct liver injury in toxic milk (tx) mice. Method(s): Recipient tx mice were sublethally irradiated (5 Gy) prior to transplantation. The congenic wild-type (DL) BM cells labeled with CM-DiI were transplanted via caudal vein injection into tx mice at the early (2 months of age) or late stage (5 months of age) of WD. The same volume of saline or tx BM cells were injected as controls. The DL donor cell population, copper concentration, serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in the various groups were evaluated at 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-transplant, respectively. Result(s): The DL BM cells population was observed from 1 to 12 weeks and peaked by the 4th week in the recipient liver after transplantation. DL BM cells transplantation during the early stage significantly corrected copper accumulation, AST across the observed time points and serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity through 8 to 12 weeks in tx mice compared with those treated with saline or tx BM cells (all P < 0.05). In contrast, BM cells transplantation during the late stage only corrected AST levels from 4 to 12 weeks post-transplant and copper accumulation at 12 weeks post-transplant (all P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between the saline and tx BM cells transplantation groups across the observed time points (P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Early stage transplantation of normal BM cells is better than late stage transplantation in correcting liver function and copper metabolism in a mouse model of WD. © 2011 Chen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded,0.1843004
334,1572,"Treatment of posterolateral tibial plateau fractures with a rotational support plate and special pressurizer: technical note and retrospective case series BACKGROUND: In tibial plateau fractures, the posterolateral segment of the tibia plateau is frequently affected and challenging to treat. Although there are many surgical approaches and fixation methods for the treatment of these fractures, all of these methods have limitations. We designed a new rotational support plate (RSP) and a special pressurizer that can fix the fracture directly via the anterolateral approach. This method is advantageous because it leads to little trauma, involves a simple operation, and has a reliable fixation effect. This study details the technique of treating these fractures with the RSP and special pressurizer and provides the outcomes. METHOD(S): From May 2016 to January 2019, the data of 12 patients with posterolateral tibial plateau fractures treated with the RSP and special pressurizer in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Postoperative rehabilitation was advised, knee X-rays were taken at follow-ups, and fracture healing, complications, and knee range of motion were assessed. The Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee score and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were used to evaluate knee function at the last follow-up. RESULT(S): The average follow-up time of all patients was 16.5 months (range, 12-25 months). The average bony union time was 3.2 months (range, 3-4.5 months). At the last follow-up, the average knee range of motion was 138degree (range, 107-145degree). The average HSS score was 91 (range, 64-98). The average KOOS Symptoms score was 90 (range, 75-96). The average KOOS Pain score was 91 (range, 72-97). The average KOOS ADL score was 91 (range, 74-97). The average KOOS sport/recreation score was 83 (range, 70-90). The average KOOS QOL score was 88 (range, 69-93). Skin necrosis, incision infections, and fixation failure did not occur during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION(S): With our newly designed RSP and special pressurizer, posterolateral tibial plateau fractures can be easily and effectively reduced and fixed through the anterolateral approach, which serves as a novel treatment for posterolateral tibial plateau fractures.",Excluded,0.1720627
336,1574,"Intensity-modulated radiation therapy reduces radiation-induced trismus in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) provides better temporomandibular joint (TMJ) sparing and, thus, may reduce the incidence of radiation-induced trismus after radiotherapy. The objectives of this study were to evaluate radiation-induced trismus in patients with NPC who had received IMRT and to assess the pretreatment factors, relevant treatment factors, and dosimetry parameters associated with trismus. METHOD(S): A prospective, single-arm measurement study with more than 5 years of follow-up was designed. Patients with newly diagnosed stage I through IVB NPC who received treatment with IMRT were eligible. Patients received 66 to 70 grays (Gy) to the gross tumor volume. The maximal interincisal distance (MID) was measured at baseline and 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years after they completed IMRT. RESULT(S): The trial enrolled 211 consecutive patients from 2001 to 2004. The mean dose to the TMJ ranged from 6.18 Gy to 51.36 Gy (median dose, 29.88 Gy). Compared with baseline MID levels, normalized MID levels at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years after IMRT were 94.6% +/- 9.9%, 92.5% +/- 10.5%, 92% +/- 10.6%, 92.2% +/- 10.5%, 92.1% +/- 10.2%, and 90.3% +/- 11.4%, respectively (P <.001). According to a revised subjective-objective management-analytical (SOMA) scale, grade 1/2 trismus was identified in 12 of 211 patients (5.7%), and no grade 3/4 trismus was observed. There was an increasing risk of trismus after IMRT when the MID was <40.5 mm at baseline compared with an MID >40.5 mm (P =.007). No dosimetric parameter was associated with trismus. CONCLUSION(S): IMRT was able to reduce the radiation dose to the TMJ and likely reduced the incidence and severity of radiation-induced trismus after radiotherapy.

337,1575,"IL-6 promotes stemness of cancer stem cells and may contribute to radiation resistance of non-small cell lung cancer Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among both men and women. Long-term survival of lung cancer patients remains low despite aggressive therapies including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Ionizing radiation (IR) is the standard therapy for patients diagnosed with localized unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However local tumor control by standard fractionated radiotherapy (RT) remains poor due to tumor resistance to IR. Accumulating evidences have indicated that cancer stem cells (CSCs, also known as cancer initiating cells) exist as a very minor population in NSCLC tumors, which are composed of heterogeneous cell populations. Our laboratory and others found that CSC population increases upon irradiation, which may contribute to radiation resistance. The role of IL-6 in NSCLC progression has been suggested since high IL-6 levels were detected in sera of lung cancer patients, but not detectable in most patients with benign lung diseases. However, the exact mechanism by which IL-6 influences lung cancer progression and its role in CSCs mediated radioresistance remain unresolved. Method(s): We isolated CD133+ CSC population from 3 NSCLC cell lines (NSCLC-CSCs) and studied the role of IL-6 in CD133+ CSCs growth by treating cells with IL-6. In addition, we manipulated IL-6 expression levels in the IL-6 expressing A549 and H157 cells by the knockdown of IL-6 using lentiviral infection system carrying IL-6siRNA and isolated CD133+ cells for further analyses. The growth and stem cell marker expressions of these CSCs, IL-6 treated or non-treated, or IL-6 expressing or knocked down cells upon irradiation were then investigated. The differences in the activation of signaling pathways and neuroendocrine differentiation were also studied. Results and Conclusion(s): We found that IL-6 increased self-renewal of NSCLC-CSCs significantly and thereby increased NSCLC-CSC population. We also found that IL-6 increased stemness of the isolated CD133+ CSCs when CD133+ cells were treated with IL-6. More importantly, when we irradiated the CD133+ CSCs isolated from the IL-6 knocked down and scramble control A549 cells, we found that the CSCs isolated from the IL-6 knocked down cells exhibited lower survival than the CSCs of control cells. Therefore, we suggest that IL-6 may contribute to NSCLC-CSCs mediated-radioresistance via (i) direct triggering radioresistance, and (ii) increasing self-renewal and stemness of the survived CSCs. Mechanistic dissection studies revealed that the increased self-renewal of CSCs by IL-6 is due to the activation of the hedgehog signaling and the increased expression of bcl-2, while the IL-6 mediated increase of radioresistance is due to the activation of neuroendocrine differentiation, Stat 3 signaling pathway, and increased expression of bcl-2.",Excluded,0.9492871

Fifteen expeditioners and 10 Sherpas were assessed during a climbing expedition on the north side of Mt Everest (8848 m). UV exposure measurement and diffuse skin reflectance spectrophotometry were performed at the beginning and end of the expedition. Over the course of the expedition, the expeditioners and Sherpas received a median dose of 93.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 61.0-102.8) and 102.5 (IQR, 72.2-117.8) minimal erythemal doses (MEDs) of UV radiation. The maximum dosage exceeded 106 +/- 1.4 MEDs. Using reflectance spectrophotometry, expeditioner and Sherpa melanin-hemoglobin increased by 83.6% (IQR, -1.5 to 89.8%) and 24.7% (IQR, -22.4 to 61.5%) for exposed skin, respectively.

Patients were assigned to the LD-DLIR group (100kV and automatic mA modulation for noise index (NI) of 23) and C-ASIR-V group (100kV and NI of 10) according to the scan protocols in the excretory phase. Two radiologists independently assessed the overall image quality, artifacts, noise and sharpness of urinary tracts. Additionally, the mean CT attenuation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) in the urinary tracts were evaluated., RESULTS: 26 patients each were included in the LD-DLIR group (10 males and 16 females; mean age: 57.23 years, range: 33-76 years) and C-ASIR-V group (14 males and 12 females; mean age: 60 years, range: 33-77 years). LD-DLIR group used a significantly lower effective radiation dose compared with the C-ASIR-V group (2.01 +/- 0.44 mSv vs 6.9 +/- 1.46 mSv, p < 0.001).

351,1589,"Evaluation of acoustic radiation force impulse imaging for the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant liver tumors BACKGROUND & AIMS: Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging is a novel radiation force-based imaging modality for the evaluation of the tissue stiffness. It can provide measurement of tissue stiffness with shear wave velocity that depends on the tissue stiffness. It has been utilized for the evaluation of liver fibrosis of chronic liver diseases. However, it is still uncertain whether ARFI imaging can be applied for the differentiation of liver tumors. The aim of this study is to examine whether ARFI elastography can differentiate benign and malignant liver tumors. METHOD(S): Forty-four patients of liver tumors were enrolled. Eighteen cases (14 men, 4 women; mean age 61.4 years) were hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 20 cases (6 men, 14 women; mean age 57.0 years) were cavernous hemangioma, and 6 cases (;4men,2women,mean age 62.8years) were metastatic liver tumor. The underlying diagnosis of these liver tumors was established with CE-MDCT, CE-MRI, and/or US-guided tumor biopsy. All patients were underwent ARFI elastography using a Siemens Acuson S2000. The velocity of the shear wave from the liver tumors was calculated as the average value of six trials. RESULT(S): The average velocities of the shear wave of HCC, cavernous hemangioma, and metastatic liver tumor were 2.08 +/-0.62m/s, 1.56+/-0.64m/s, and 2.42+/-1.05m/s, respectively. The average velocities of the shear wave of HCC and metastatic liver tumor were significantly higher than that of cavernous hemangioma (p <0.05, Mann- Whitney test). But no significant difference was observed between those of HCC and metastatic liver tumor. It is noteworthy that although the primary tumors of the 6 cases of metastatic liver tumors were varied (2 pancreas cancers, urinary bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, and lung cancer), the average velocity of the metastatic liver tumors of these cancers was significantly higher than that of cavernous hemangioma. In addition, the average of velocity of the shear wave of the liver bearing HCC (1.68+/-0.42m/s) was significantly higher (p<0.05, Mann-Whitney test) than those of the livers bearing cavernous hemangioma (1.08+/-0.27m/s) and metastatic liver tumor (1.13+/-0.27m/s), consisting with that patients of HCC are accompanied with chronic hepatic diseases.

354,1592,"Hapten-specific IgE antibody responses in mice. VI. Selective enhancement of IgE antibody production by low doses of X-irradiation and by cyclophosphamide Exposure of BALB/c, A/J, and (BALB/c X A/J)F1 mice, which are IgE high responder animals, to total body x-irradiation ranging from 50 to 200 R resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of the hapten-specific IgE antibody level as compared to unirradiated control mice. In contrast, anti-hapten antibody responses of the IgG class in these same animals were rarely enhanced, and when so, were of a lesser degree. This relatively selective augmentation of the IgE vs IgG antibody responses was observed in both unprimed and primed mice. By utilizing adoptive transfer systems, it was demonstrated that the enhancing effects of x-irradiation resulted from its action on the carrier-primed cell population and not upon the responding B cells or upon macrophages. The data presented herein suggest that this enhancement phenomenon is the result of the elimination of T cells (or their products) with suppressive functions and that these cells are neither dependent upon nor specific for the carrier antigen employed in the immunization. This hypothesis is given indirect support by the observations that treatment of the same strains of mice with cyclophosphamide, in doses known to abrogate suppressive T cell functions, resulted in a similar enhancing effect to that observed after low doses of x-irradiation. In addition an interesting difference between IgE and IgG precursor B lymphocytes was observed by the ability of IgE B cells to differentiate to the secretory state at a strikingly more rapid rate than IgG B lymphocytes when exposed to comparable T cell helper influences. These observations may provide important clues to the cellular mechanisms of the immune regulation of the IgE response and its relationship to allergic diseases.",Excluded,0.9612327

Complete obliteration of the nidus is not always possible. We describe over 20 years of radiosurgical procedures for brainstem AVMs, focusing on clinical outcomes and radiosurgical techniques., METHODS: Between 1992 and 2011, the authors performed gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in 464 cerebral AVMs. Twenty-nine of the 464 patients (6.3%) reviewed had brainstem AVMs. This series included sixteen males and thirteen females with a mean age of 30.7 years (range : 5-71 years). The symptoms that led to diagnoses were as follows : an altered mentality (5 patients, 17.3%), motor weakness (10 patients, 34.5%), cranial nerve symptoms (3 patients, 10.3%), headache (6 patients, 20.7%), dizziness (3 patients, 10.3%), and seizures (2 patients, 6.9%). Two patients had undergone a previous nidus resection, and three patients had undergone a previous embolization. Twenty-four patients underwent only GKRS. With respect to the nidus type and blood flow, the ratio of compact type to diffuse type and high flow to low flow were 17 : 12 and 16 : 13, respectively. In this series, 24 patients (82.8%) had a prior hemorrhage. The mean target volume was 1.7 cm(3) (range 0.1-11.3 cm(3)). The mean maximal and marginal radiation doses were 38.5 Gy (range 28.6-43.6 Gy) and 23.4 Gy (range 18-27 Gy), and the mean isodose profile was 61.3% (range 50-70%)., RESULTS: Twenty-four patients had brainstem AVMs and were followed for more than 3 years. Obliteration of the AVMs was eventually documented in 17 patients (70.8%) over a mean follow-up period of 77.5 months (range 36-216 months). With respect to nidus type and blood flow, the obliteration rate of compact types (75%) was higher than that of diffuse types (66.7%), and the obliteration rate of low flow AVMs (76.9%) was higher than that of high flow AVMs (63.6%) (p<0.05). Two patients (6.9%) with three hemorrhagic events suffered a hemorrhage during the follow-up period. The annual bleeding rate of AVM after GKRS was 1.95% per year. No adverse radiation effects or delayed cystic formations were found., CONCLUSION: GKRS has an important clinical role in treatment of brainstem AVMs, which carry excessive surgical risks. Angiographic features and radiosurgical techniques using a lower maximal dose with higher isodose profiles are important for lesion obliteration and the avoidance of complications.",Excluded,0.17439476
370,1608,"Dual-source abdominopelvic computed tomography: Comparison of image quality and radiation dose of 80 kVp and 80/150 kVp with tin filter OBJECTIVE: To compare the radiation dose and the objective and subjective image quality of 80 kVp and 80/150 kVp with tin filter (80/Sn150 kVp) computed tomography (CT) in oncology patients., METHODS: One-hundred-and-forty-five consecutive oncology patients who underwent third-generation dual-source dual-energy CT of the abdomen for evaluation of malignant visceral, peritoneal, extraperitoneal, and bone tumor were retrospectively recruited. Two radiologists independently reviewed each observation in 80 kVp CT and 80/Sn150 kVp CT. Modified line-density profile of the tumor and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were measured. Diagnostic confidence, lesion conspicuity, and subjective image quality were calculated and compared between image sets. The effective dose and size-specific dose estimate (SSDE) were calculated in the image sets., RESULTS: Modified line-density profile analysis revealed higher attenuation differences between the tumor and normal tissue in 80 kVp CT than in 80/Sn150 kVp CT (127 vs. 107, P = 0.05). The 80 kVp CT showed increased CNR in the liver (8.0 vs. 7.6) and the aorta (18.9 vs. 16.3) than the 80/Sn150 kVp CT. The 80 kVp CT yielded higher enhancement of organs (4.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.7 +/- 0.4, P<0.001) and lesion conspicuity (4.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 4.8 +/- 0.5, P = 0.035) than the 80/Sn150 kVp CT; overall image quality and confidence index were comparable. The effective dose was reduced by 45.2% with 80 kVp CT (2.3 mSv +/- 0.9) compared to 80/Sn150 kVp CT (4.1 mSv +/- 1.5). The SSDE was 7.4 +/- 3.8 mGy on 80/Sn150 kVp CT and 4.1 +/- 2.2 mGy on 80 kVp CT., CONCLUSIONS: The 80 kVp CT reduced the radiation dose by 45.2% in oncology patients while showing comparable or superior image quality to that of 80/Sn150 kVp CT for abdominal tumor evaluation.",Excluded,0.17196593
371,1609,"Preoperative chemoradiotherapy for elderly patients with locally advanced rectal cancer-a real-world outcome study OBJECTIVE: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy has been established as a standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. It is unclear whether preoperative chemoradiotherapy is truly beneficial in the elderly patients. Our aim was to assess the impact of age on the treatment tolerance and clinical outcomes., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 160 consecutive patients with clinical stage T3-4, and/or lymph node positive tumors who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy from May 2003 to December 2010 at a single hospital. Treatment tolerance and outcomes were compared between patients >=70 years (N = 56) and <70 years (N = 104)., RESULTS: There was no disparity in the achievement of prescribed radiation dose and dose reduction of chemotherapy between two groups. Pathologic complete response rate (15.6% vs. 16.0%) and sphincter preservation rate (91.1% vs. 95.0%; P = 0.459) were not significantly different. The 3-year disease-free survival of older vs. younger patients was 77.8% vs. 92.3% and 5-year disease-free survival was 60.0% vs. 78.6%, respectively (P = 0.023). In multivariable analysis, age was significantly associated with disease-free survival (P = 0.033) but comorbidities were not (P = 0.092). However, both age (hazard ratio, 2.331; P = 0.028) and comorbidities (hazard ratio, 2.772; P = 0.031) were significantly associated with overall survival as well as clinical stage. Anemia was the only adverse effect more prominent in older patients., CONCLUSIONS: Older patients showed non-inferior compliance and equivalent pathologic complete response rates without an increased incidence of treatment complications with preoperative chemoradiotherapy. More comprehensive consideration than age alone is warranted in the decision of applying preoperative chemoradiotherapy to elderly patients with rectal cancer. Copyright © The Author 2016.

374,1612,"Gastroduodenal complications after concurrent chemoradiation therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: endoscopic findings and risk factors PURPOSE: Concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) is useful in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but little is known about radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications following therapy. To determine risk factors, we investigated the prevalence and patterns of gastroduodenal complications following CCRT using endoscopy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Enrolled in the study were 123 patients treated with CCRT for unresectable HCC between January 1998 and December 2005. Radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications were defined as radiation gastritis/duodenitis, radiation gastric/duodenal ulcer, or other gastroduodenal toxicity associated with radiation, based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 3.0). Serious gastroduodenal complications were defined as events occurring within 12 months from completion of CCRT, those requiring prompt therapeutic intervention, or symptoms equivalent to Grade 3 or 4 radiation-related gastroduodenal toxicity, including nausea or vomiting, based on CTCAE 3.0., RESULTS: A month after completion of CCRT, 65 (52.8%) patients displayed endoscopic evidence of radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications. Radiation gastric and duodenal ulcers were found in 32 (26.0%) and 20 (16.3%) patients, respectively; radiation gastritis and duodenitis were found in 50 (40.7%) and 42 (34.1%) patients, respectively. Radiation-related bleeding was observed in 13 patients (10.6%). Serious gastroduodenal complications occurred in 18 patients (14.6%) and were significantly more frequent in patients with liver cirrhosis than in those without cirrhosis (p=0.043). There were no radiation-related deaths., CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopically detectable radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications were common in HCC following CCRT. Although serious complications were uncommon, the frequency was higher in patients with liver cirrhosis; thus, these patients should be closely monitored when receiving CCRT.

376,1614,"Improvement in automated quantitation of myocardial perfusion abnormality by using iterative reconstruction image in combination with resolution recovery, attenuation and scatter corrections for the detection of coronary artery disease OBJECTIVE: An iterative reconstruction method in combination with resolution recovery, attenuation and scatter corrections (IR-RASC) can improve image quality. It, however, is undetermined whether this technique can improve the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) when automated quantitative analysis is used. This study evaluated diagnostic values of IR-RASC in combination with automated quantitative analysis in stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in the CAD detection., METHODS: This study enrolled consecutive 64 patients (mean age 66.2 +/- 17.3 years, 39 males) who had undergone both 99mTc-labeled tetrofosmin stress MPI and coronary angiography within 3 months. Stress MPI abnormalities quantified as summed stress score (SSS), summed rest score (SRS) and summed difference score (SDS) by Heart Risk View-S (HRV-S) and Quantitative Perfusion SPECT (QPS) softwares using IR-RASC images were compared with those by using conventional filtered back-projection method (FBP) images and angiographic findings., RESULTS: Based on expert visual assessment, SSS and SRS by HRV-S/QPS softwares with IR-RASC were significantly lower than those by HRV-S/QPS softwares with FBP at mid- and basal left ventricular segments. Receiver-operating characteristics analysis showed that areas under the curve assessed by HRV-S (0.687) and QPS (0.678) with IR-RASC were nearly identical to those (0.717-0.724) by expert assessment with FBP, and were significantly (P < 0.05) greater than those by HRV-S (0.505) and QPS (0.522) with FBP. When HRV-S was used, the specificity and diagnostic accuracy of IR-RASC in the CAD detection were significantly greater than those of FBP: 90.3 versus 51.6%, P < 0.0001 and 79.7 versus 54.7%, P = 0.0027, respectively. Likewise, when QPS was used, the specificity and diagnostic accuracy of IR-RASC in the CAD detection were significantly greater than those of FBP: 80.6 versus 41.9%, P < 0.0001, and 78.1 versus 51.6%, P = 0.0018, respectively. There, however, were no significant differences in sensitivity between IR-RASC and FBP images., CONCLUSIONS: IR-RASC can improve diagnostic accuracy of the CAD detection using an automated scoring system compared to FBP, by reducing false positivity due to artefactual appearance.",Excluded,0.17204742
378,1616,"The effects of stimulation frequency and fatigue on the force-intensity relationship for human skeletal muscle OBJECTIVE: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has not gained widespread application for a number of factors; two of which are rapid muscle fatigue and imprecise control in force. Stimulation intensity is adjusted during FES to overcome the decline in muscle force due to fatigue and precisely control muscle force output. The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between muscle force output and stimulation intensity and to see how this relationship changes with fatigue., METHODS: Quadriceps femoris muscles of 10 able-bodied adults were tested isometrically. Pre- and post-fatigue muscle force responses to stimulation trains with different intensities and frequencies were recorded and analyzed. In addition, a case study using a subject with spinal cord injury was presented to illustrate the use of the force-intensity relationship to reduce muscle fatigue and improve the control of muscle force during repetitive electrical stimulation., RESULTS: An exponential relationship between muscle force and stimulation intensity was observed; interestingly, the normalized force-intensity relationship did not change with stimulation frequency or fatigue., CONCLUSIONS: The observed consistencies in the force-intensity relationship should assist scientists and clinicians to more accurately predict the forces produced by a muscle with changes in pulse duration during repetitive electrical stimulation., SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of this study provide guidelines for clinicians and researchers to adjust the stimulation intensity to achieve precise control of force repetitively during the application of FES.",Excluded,0.17431515
380,1618,"Dexamethasone for the prophylaxis of radiation-induced pain flare after palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases: a pilot study PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of dexamethasone as a prophylactic adjuvant analgesic to decrease pain flare and to assess its safety and tolerance of dexamethasone., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients treated with a single 8 Gy for bone metastases took 8 mg dexamethasone before the radiation treatment. The Brief Pain Inventory was administered at baseline and then daily for 10 days after radiation. Pain flare was defined as a two-point increase in the worst pain or a 25% increase in the analgesic intake when compared with the baseline., RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (23 males, 10 females) had complete follow-up data. Their median age was 73 years old. Ten patients had progressive worsening pain during the entire 10-day follow-up. A total of eight patients (24%; 95% CI, 10-39%) experienced pain flare during the 10-day follow-up. Two patients had a 1-day pain flare on day 3. Three patients had a 1-day pain flare on day 7. Three other patients had a prolonged pain flare: one had a 3-day pain flare on days 2-4, one had a 3-day pain flare on days 4-6, and the other, a 6-day pain flare on days 3-8. The half-life of dexamethasone is 36-54 h. Only one patient (3%) experienced pain flare in the first 2 days of follow-up with the action of dexamethasone. Dexamethasone was well tolerated., CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone might be effective in the prophylaxis of radiation-induced pain flare after palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases. Randomized trials are required to confirm the finding.",Excluded,0.1733908
381,1619,"Radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy after definitive radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Clinical predictors and dose-toxicity relationship BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy is a debilitating and irreversible late complication after definitive radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and other skull base tumors. This study sets to evaluate its incidence and clinical predictive factors, and to propose relevant dosimetric constraints for this structure to guide radiotherapy planning., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook a retrospective review of 797 NPC patients who underwent definitive intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) between 2003 and 2011. Cumulative incidence and clinical predictors for radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy were evaluated. Archived radiotherapy plans were retrieved and 330 independent hypoglossal nerves were retrospectively contoured following standardized atlas. Optimal threshold analyses of dosimetric parameters (Dmax, D0.5cc, D1cc, D2cc, Dmean) were conducted using receiver operating characteristic curves. Normal tissue complication probability was generated with logistic regression modeling., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 8.1years, sixty-nine (8.7%) patients developed radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy. High radiotherapy dose, premorbid diabetes, advanced T-stage and radiological hypoglossal canal involvement were independent clinical risk factors. Maximum dose received by 1cc volume (D1cc) was the best predictor for the development of radiation-induced nerve palsy (AUC=0.826) at 8years after IMRT. Hypoglossal nerves with D1cc of 74Gy EQD2 had an estimated palsy risk of 4.7%. Nerves with D1cc <74Gy EQD2 had significantly lower risk of palsy than those >=74Gy EQD2 (2.4% vs 20.8%, p <0.001)., CONCLUSION: Incidence of radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy was high after definitive IMRT for NPC. D1cc <74Gy EQD2 can serve as a useful dose constraint to adopt during radiotherapy planning to limit palsy risk to <5% at 8years after IMRT. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Material(s) and Method(s): Between July 1996 and June 2010, 104 patients underwent surgery for rectal cancer after preoperative CRT. The median dose of radiotherapy was 50.4 Gy (range, 43.2 to 54.4 Gy) for 6 weeks. Chemotherapy was a bolus injection of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin for the first and last week of radiotherapy (n=84, 77.1%) or capecitabine administered daily during radiotherapy (n=17, 16.3%). Low anterior resection (n=86, 82.7%) or abdominoperineal resection (n=18, 17.3%) was performed at a median 47 days from the end of radiotherapy, and four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy was administered. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was checked at initial diagnosis and just before surgery. Result(s): After a median follow-up of 48 months (range, 9 to 174 months), 5-year disease free survival (DFS) was 74.5% and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 86.4%. Down staging of T diagnoses occurred in 32 patients (30.8%) and of N diagnoses in 40 patients (38.5%). The CEA change from initial diagnosis to pre-surgery (high-high vs. highnormal vs. normal-normal) was a statistically significant prognostic factor for DFS (p=0.012), OS (p=0.002), and distant metastasis free survival (p=0.018) in a multivariate analysis. Conclusion(s): Patients who achieve normal CEA level by the time of surgery have a more favorable outcome than those who retain a high CEA level after preoperative CRT. The normalization of CEA levels can provide important information about the prognosis in rectal cancer treatment. © 2013 by the Korean Cancer Association.",Excluded,0.17117488

391,1629,"Short-course preoperative radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy in resectable locally advanced rectal cancer: local control and quality of life The authors sought to evaluate the clinical outcome after preoperative short-course radiotherapy (SC-RT) for locally advanced resectable rectal cancer in terms of local control (LC) and quality of life (QoL). Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer enrolled between 1997 and 2008 in an observational study of preoperative SC-RT were analysed. The treatment algorithm was neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) administered for four cycles, followed by preoperative SC-RT administered 1 week after chemotherapy completion, delivering 20 Gy in five fractions over 1 week. Immediately in the following week surgery was performed. The adjuvant 5-FU-based CT was planned for pathological stage UICC>=II. LC, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), early and late complications (RTOG scale) were analysed. All patients completed the EORTC QoL (C-30 and C-38), Faecal Incontinence QoL, and International Index of Erectile Function questionnaires (IIEF). A total of 67 patients were analysed. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy were well tolerated. At the pathological analysis, stable disease was obtained in 24 patients (36%), reduction of disease stage in 34 patients (50.7%), and progression in nine cases (13.3%). Adjuvant chemotherapy was indicated in 21 patients. Two locoregional recurrences, both within the radiotherapy volume, were observed, resulting in a 5-year LC of 97%. The 5-year DFS was 84%, with mean time to systemic progression of 24 months. After a mean follow-up of 114 months, the 5-year OS rate was 67%. Late toxicity >grade II was observed in 9% of patients. High anterior resection (AR) patients had significantly better scores than low AR or abdomino-perineal resection (APR). A total of 89% of the patients treated with conservative surgery had regular anal sphincter function. In male patients undergoing AR or APR, erectile dysfunction was found in 47% and 75% of the cases, respectively. Preoperative SC-RT combined with chemotherapy for locally advanced resectable rectal cancers was well tolerated. This treatment resulted in favourable LC, OS, low rates of toxicity and satisfying QoL.",Excluded,0.17142707
394,1632,"Lung cancer detection with low-dose spiral computed tomography in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients PURPOSE: To determine whether low-dose spiral computed tomography (LDCT) can improve the lung cancer detection rate in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects., MATERIAL AND METHODS: From October 1999 to December 2003, 374 COPD patients underwent LDCT for lung carcinoma screening. All subjects with an abnormal baseline CT scan were followed with serial CT scans as part of our protocol. Follow-up was continued until the demonstration of no change over a minimum of 24 months, or resolution. Sputum samples were also obtained for cytological analysis., RESULTS: On the baseline spiral CT scan, 132 of 374 patients (35.2%) had at least one non-calcified nodule that required periodic follow-up with CT scans. The median follow-up time was 21 months (range 2-48 months). Of the 374 COPD subjects, nine patients with primary lung cancer (2.4%) were detected: six were squamous cell carcinomas, two were small-cell lung carcinomas (SCLC), and one was adenosquamous carcinoma. Three of the nine tumors were in stage IA, two in stage IIB, two in stage IIIA, and two were limited SCLC. Potentially curative pulmonary resection was performed in four patients, pulmonary lobectomy in three, and wedge excision in one. One subject with stage IA squamous cell carcinoma received radiotherapy, as pulmonary function was severely impaired. In addition, four patients underwent removal of benign lesions. Sputum was collected in 205 (54.8%) of 374 patients. There were 154 (75 %) metaplasia, 14 (6%) moderate dysplasia, and one (0.4%) malignant case., CONCLUSION: LDCT increases early lung carcinoma detection rate in COPD patients, but pulmonary function impairment may reduce its benefit.",Excluded,0.17300229

Twenty-one cases of base-of-skull meningioma (median planning target volume [PTV] = 21.3 cm3) previously treated with stereotactic radiotherapy were replanned with each technique. The plans were compared for Radiation Therapy Oncology Group conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI), and doses to normal structures at 6 dose values from 50.4 Gy to 5.6 Gy. The mean CI was 1.75 (CF), 1.75 (DA), and 1.66 (IMRT) (p < 0.05 when comparing IMRT to either CF or DA plans). The CI (IMRT) was inversely proportional to the size of the PTV (Spearman's rho = -0.53, p = 0.01) and at PTV sizes above 25 cm3, the CI (IMRT) was always superior to CI (DA) and CI (CF). At PTV sizes below 25 cm3, there was no significant difference in CI between each technique. There was no significant difference in HI between plans. The total volume of normal tissue receiving 50.4, 44.8, and 5.6 Gy was significantly lower when comparing IMRT to CF and DA plans (p < 0.05). There was significantly improved dose sparing for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe with IMRT but no significant difference for the optic chiasm or pituitary gland. These results demonstrate that stereotactic IMRT should be considered to treat base-of-skull meningiomas with a PTV larger than 25 cm3, due to improved conformity and normal tissue sparing, in particular for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe.",Excluded,0.17558794
397,1635,"Sargramostim accelerates leukocyte recovery and improves mortality rate at day 60 in a non-human primate model of hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome when administered 48 h after total body irradiation Background: Hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) occurs in individuals that are exposed to high levels of radiation over a short period of time. The destruction of bone marrow leads to pancytopenia, which increases the incidence of infections and accounts for the majority of morbidity and mortality. Sargramostim (yeast-derived rhGM-CSF) is a leukocyte growth factor that promotes differentiation, maturation and activation of granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages. Method(s): We evaluated the efficacy of repeat administrations of sargramostim (7 mug/kg/day) in a blinded, GLP study in total body irradiated non-human primates (NHPs) when administered 48 h postirradiation with minimal supportive care (e.g., no blood products or individualized antibiotics). The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of sargramostim versus vehicle on mortality rate at Day 60 in irradiated male and female NHPs at LD50-60/60 (n=36/group). Secondary objectives included the efficacy of sargramostim on overall survival and its effect on hematology parameters. The study included an exploratory arm of male and female NHPs that were irradiated at a LD70-80/60 (n= 18/group) and received the same treatments. Result(s): Sargramostim decreased the mortality rate at Day 60 by 36% in the LD50-60/60group (p=0.0018) and by 44% in the LD70-80/60group (p=0.0076). Additionally, neutrophil, platelet, lymphocyte, and white blood cell levels in survivors demonstrated accelerated recovery in the sargramostim-treated NHPs in the LD50-60/60and LD70-80/60groups. Conclusion(s): Treatment with sargramostim (7 mug/kg/day) beginning at 48 h, in the absence of blood products and individualized antibiotics, suggests that the use of sargramostim is a viable therapeutic strategy for H-ARS in a mass casualty event.",Excluded,0.1776889
398,1636,"Perception of longitudinal body axis in microgravity during parabolic flight It has been proposed that an internal representation of body vertical has a prominent role in spatial orientation. This investigation investigated the ability of human subjects to accurately locate their longitudinal body axis (an imaginary straight body midline running from head to toes) while free-floating in microgravity. Subjects were tested in-flight, as well as on ground in normal gravity in both the upright and supine orientations to provide baseline measurements. The subjects wore a goggle device and were in total darkness. They used knobs to rotate two luminous lines until they were parallel to the subjective direction of their longitudinal body axis, in the roll (right/left) and the pitch (forward/backward) planes. Results showed that the error between the perceived and the objective direction of the longitudinal body axis was significantly larger in microgravity than in normal gravity. This error in this egocentric frame of reference is presumably due to the absence of somatosensory cues when free-floating. Mechanical pressure on the chest using an airbag reduced the error in perception of the longitudinal body axis in microgravity, thus improving spatial orientation.",Excluded,0.17878807
399,1637,"Perception of Egocentric Distance during Gravitational Changes in Parabolic Flight We explored the effect of gravity on the perceived representation of the absolute distance of objects to the observers within the range from 1.5-6 m. Experiments were performed on board the CNES Airbus Zero-G during parabolic flights eliciting repeated exposures to short periods of microgravity (0 g), hypergravity (1.8 g), and normal gravity (1 g). Two methods for obtaining estimates of perceived egocentric distance were used: verbal reports and visually directed motion toward a memorized visual target. For the latter method, because normal walking is not possible in 0 g, blindfolded subjects translated toward the visual target by pulling on a rope with their arms. The results showed that distance estimates using both verbal reports and blind pulling were significantly different between normal gravity, microgravity, and hypergravity. Compared to the 1 g measurements, the estimates of perceived distance using blind pulling were shorter for all distances in 1.8 g, whereas in 0 g they were longer for distances up to 4 m and shorter for distances beyond. These findings suggest that gravity plays a role in both the sensorimotor system and the perceptual/cognitive system for estimating egocentric distance.",Excluded,0.18363531

The treatment for piriformis syndrome using fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), electromyography (EMG), and ultrasound (US) has become standard practice. The treatment of Piriformis Syndrome has evolved to include fluoroscopy and EMG with CT guidance. We present a case study of 5 successful piriformis injections using 3-D computer-assisted electromagnet needle tracking coupled with ultrasound. A 6-degree of freedom electromagnetic position tracker was attached to the ultrasound probe that allowed the system to detect the position and orientation of the probe in the magnetic field. The tracked ultrasound probe was used to find the posterior superior iliac spine. Subsequently, 3 points were captured to register the ultrasound image with the CT or magnetic resonance image scan. Moreover, after the registration was obtained, the navigation system visualized the tracked needle relative to the CT scan in real-time using 2 orthogonal multi-planar reconstructions centered at the tracked needle tip. Conversely, a recent study revealed that fluoroscopically guided injections had 30% accuracy compared to ultrasound guided injections, which tripled the accuracy percentage. This novel technique exhibited an accurate needle guidance injection precision of 98% while advancing to the piriformis muscle and avoiding the sciatic nerve.

403,1641,"Effects of non-covalent self-association on the subcutaneous absorption of a therapeutic peptide PURPOSE: To utilize an acylated peptide as a model system to investigate the relationships among solution peptide conformation, non-covalent self-association, subcutaneous absorption and bioavailability under pharmaceutically relevant solution formulation conditions., METHODS: CD spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, equilibrium sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and size exclusion chromatography were employed to characterize the effects of octanoylation on conformation and self-association of the 31 amino acid peptide derivative des-amino-histidine(7) arginine(26) human glucagon-like peptide (7-37)-OH (IP(7)R(26)GLP-1). Hyperglycemic clamp studies were performed to compare the bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of solution formulations of oct-IP(7)R(26)GLP-1 administered subcutaneously to normal dogs., RESULTS: Octanoylation of IP(7)R(26)GLP-1 was shown to confer the propensity for a major solvent-induced conformational transition with an accompanying solvent- and temperature-dependent self-association behavior. Formulations were characterized that give rise to remarkably different pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics that correlate with distinct peptide conformational and self-association states. These states correspond to: (i) a minimally associated alpha-helical form (apparent molecular weight = 14 kDa), (ii) a highly associated, predominantly beta-sheet form (effective molecular diameter 20 nm), and (iii) an unusually large, micelle-like soluble beta-sheet aggregate (effective molecular diameter 50 nm)., CONCLUSIONS: Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of a self-associating peptide can be influenced by aggregate size and the ease of disruption of the non-covalent intermolecular interactions at the subcutaneous site. Hydrophobic aggregation mediated by seemingly innocuous solution formulation conditions can have a dramatic effect on the subcutaneous bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of a therapeutic peptide and in the extreme, can totally preclude its absorption. A size exclusion chromatographic method is identified that distinguishes subcutaneously bioavailable aggregated oct-IP(7)R(26)GLP-1 from non-bioavailable aggregated oct-IP(7)R(26)GLP-1.",Excluded,0.1818707
405,1643,"Preoperative intensified radiochemotherapy for rectal cancer: Experience of a single institution Purpose: The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and the effectiveness of an intensified neoadjuvant protocol with the addition of weekly oxaliplatin in the preoperative strategy of rectal cancer treatment. Patients and Methods: Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer received continous infusion 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) 200 mg/m2/day in combination with weekly oxaliplatin at a dose of 50 mg/m2. Doses of radiotherapy were 45 Gy to the whole pelvis plus 5.4-9 Gy to the tumour mass. The primary end-points of the study were evaluation of toxicity, compliance with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, downstaging, pathological complete response (pCR) and the rate of sphincter preservation for distal cancers. Secondary end-points were relapse-free and overall survival. Result(s): From November 2006 to June 2009, 51 patients were enrolled into the study. Compliance with chemotherapy was 80%. The incidence of G3 diarrhoea and proctitis were 17.6% and 21.5%, respectively. Surgery was performed in 48 patients with 100% R0 resection. 76.4% of low-lying tumours underwent conservative treatment. Seventy-nine percent of patients were downstaged: T and N downstaging were observed in 71% and 75% of patients, respectively. A pCR was obtained in 11 (22.9%) patients. Conclusion(s): Intensification of neoadjuvant treatment for rectal cancer with the addition of weekly oxaliplatin is feasible, with remarkable rates of downstaging and pathological complete response. Data on sphincter preservation for distal cancers were excellent. Phase III trials with a longer follow-up will establish whether this good outcome in terms of surrogate end-points will translate into better rates of disease-free and overall survival. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded,0.17051147
406,1644,"Non-invasive diffuse reflectance measurements of cutaneous melanin content can predict human sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation The diversity of human skin phenotypes and the ubiquitous exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) underscore the need for a non-invasive tool to predict an individual's UVR sensitivity. We analysed correlations between UVR sensitivity, melanin content, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DR) and UVR-induced DNA damage in the skin of subjects from three racial/ethnic groups: Asian, Black or African American and White. UVR sensitivity was determined by evaluating each subject's response to one minimal erythemal dose (MED) of UVR one day after the exposure. Melanin content was measured using DR and by densitometric analysis of Fontana-Masson staining (FM) in skin biopsies taken from unexposed areas. An individual's UVR sensitivity based on MED was highly correlated with melanin content measured by DR and by FM. Therefore, a predictive model for the non-invasive determination of UVR sensitivity using DR was developed. The MED precision was further improved when we took race/ethnicity into consideration. The use of DR serves as a tool for predicting UVR sensitivity in humans that should be invaluable for determining appropriate UVR doses for therapeutic, diagnostic and/or cosmetic devices. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Excluded,0.17759776

The primary tumors included malignant melanoma (n = 10), non-small cell lung carcinoma (n = 6), renal cell carcinoma (n = 3), colorectal carcinoma (n = 1), oropharyngeal carcinoma (n = 1), and adenocarcinoma of unknown origin (n = 3). All tumors were less than or equal to 3.0 cm in greatest diameter. Twenty patients received a planned combination of 30-40 Gy whole brain fractionated irradiation and a radiosurgical ""boost"" of 16-20 Gy to the tumor margins; one patient refused conventional fractionated irradiation. Three patients with recurrent, persistent, or new non-small cell lung carcinomas had radiosurgical treatment 12-20 months after receiving 30-42.5 Gy whole-brain external beam irradiation. Stereotactic computed tomographic imaging was used for target coordinate determination and imaging-integrated dose planning. All tumors were enclosed by the 50-90% isodose shell using one (n = 22), two (n = 1), or three (n = 1) irradiation isocenters. During this 23-month period (median follow-up of 7 months) no patient died from progression of a radiosurgically-treated brain metastasis. Ten patients died of systemic disease (n = 8) or remote central nervous system metastasis (n = 2) between 1 week and 10 months after radiosurgery. One patient had tumor progression and underwent craniotomy and tumor excision 5 months after radiosurgery. To date, median survival after radiosurgery has been 10 months; 1-year survival was 33.3%. Stereotactic radiosurgery eliminated the surgical and anesthetic risks associated with craniotomy and resection of solitary brain metastases.

409,1647,"Lung tumour induction in mice after uniform and non-uniform external thoracic X-irradiation The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of the ICRP procedure of using average tissue/organ dose in estimating carcinogenic risk. It has been suggested that highly non-uniform exposure ('hot spots') is much more carcinogenic than an equivalent dose delivered uniformly. In a series of experiments, mice were irradiated with X-rays either uniformly to the thorax or non-uniformly with 72 1-mm microbeams which irradiated approximately 20 per cent of the total lung volume. Two experiments involving uniform irradiation showed a peaked tumour incidence curve with a maximum at 5 Gy. The first 'microbeam' study also produced a pronounced peak in the dose response with a maximum tumour incidence at 1 Gy average lung dose or 5 Gy to the irradiated lung tissue. This implied the use of average tissue dose might underestimate the carcinogenic hazard of non-uniform exposure. Later, more extensive, microbeam experiments failed to replicate this finding. The results were nearly similar to those for uniform irradiation, with a slight increase in tumour incidence from 2.5-5.0 Gy average lung dose. These results imply that for these irradiation conditions the ICRP dose averaging procedure remains valid.",Excluded,0.938269

To investigate the patterns of relapse following intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) given after radical surgery for oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer. Patients and methods. One hundred and two patients with oral or oropharyngeal cancer were treated with radical surgery followed by IMRT up to a mean total dose of 60 Gy between years 2001 and 2007. Thirty-nine of the patients (%) also received concomitant weekly cisplatin. Forty of the patients had oral and 62 had oropharyngeal cancer. Data on the tumour, patient and treatment factors were collected. Following therapy the patients were followed by clinical examination, endoscopy and MRI/CT at 2- to 3-months interval up to 2 years and thereafter at 6-month intervals. Results. The mean follow-up time of the patients was 55 months (range, 26-106 months). The rate for local tumour control for the whole cohort was 92.2%: 87.5% for oral cancer patients and 96.7% for oropharyngeal cancer patients. The 5-year disease specific survival was 90.2% and 5-year overall survival 84.3%. During the follow-up eight locoregional recurrences were observed, three at the primary tumour site and one at regional nodal site and four at both sites. The mean time to primary tumour recurrence was seven months (range, 2-10 months) and to nodal recurrence seven months (range, 2-12 months). Distant metastasis occurred in six (6%) patients. The factors associated with poor prognosis were the primary tumour size and tumour site with oral cancers having worse outcome. The treatment was well tolerated with no unexpected toxicities. The most frequent late toxicity was dysphagia necessitating permanent PEG in five patients. This was correlated with the advanced primary tumour size and resulting in wide tumour excision and reconstruction. Conclusions. Surgery combined with postoperative radiotherapy given as IMRT results in low level of tumour recurrence. © 2011 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded,0.17268506
416,1654,"Simulation of inflorescence dynamics in oil palm and estimation of environment-sensitive phenological phases: a model based analysis For oil palm, yield variation is in large part due to variation in the number of harvested bunches. Each successively-produced phytomer carries a female (productive), male or aborted inflorescence. Since phytomer development takes 3-4 years and nearly two phytomers are produced per month, many inflorescences develop in parallel but have different phenological stages. Environment-dependent developmental rate, sex and abortion probability determine bunch productivity, which, in turn, affects other phytomers via source-sink relationships. Water deficit, solar radiation, temperature and day length are considered key external factors driving variation. Their impact is difficult to predict because of system complexity. To address this question we built a simple model (ECOPALM) to simulate the variation in number of harvested bunches. In this model, trophic competition among organs, expressed through a plant-scale index (Ic), drives sex determination and inflorescence abortion during specific sensitive phases at phytomer level. As a supplemental hypothesis, we propose that flowering is affected by photoperiod at phytomer level during a sensitive phase, thus, contributing to seasonal production peaks. The model was used to determine by parameter optimisation the influence of Ic and day length on inflorescence development and the stages at which inflorescences are sensitive to these signals. Parameters were estimated against observation of number of harvested bunches in Ivory Coast using a genetic algorithm. The model was then validated with field observations in Benin and Indonesia. The sensitive phases determined by parameter optimisation agreed with independent experimental evidence, and variation of Ic explained both sex and abortion patterns. Sex determination seemed to coincide with floret meristem individualisation and occurred 29-32 months before bunch harvest. The main abortion stage occurred 10 months before harvest - at the beginning of rapid growth of the inflorescence. Simulation results suggest involvement of photoperiod in the determination of bunch growth dynamics. This study demonstrates that simple modelling approaches can help extracting ecophysiological information from simple field observations on complex systems.",Excluded,0.18604015
417,1655,"Prospective evaluation of early treatment outcome in patients with meningiomas treated with particle therapy based on target volume definition with MRI and 68Ga-DOTATOC-PET Purpose. To evaluate early treatment results and toxicity in patients with meningiomas treated with particle therapy. Material and methods. Seventy patients with meningiomas were treated with protons (n = 38) or carbon ion radiotherapy (n = 26). Median age was 49 years. Median age at treatment was 55 years, 24 were male (34%), and 46 were female (66%). Histology was benign meningioma in 26 patients (37%), atypical in 23 patients (33%) and anaplastic in four patients (6%). In 17 patients (24%) with skull base meningiomas diagnosis was based on the typical appearance of a meningioma. For benign meningiomas, total doses of 52.2-57.6 GyE were applied with protons. For high-grade lesions, the boost volume was 18 GyE carbon ions, with a median dose of 50 GyE applied as highly conformal radiation therapy. Nineteen patients were treated as re-irradiation. Treatment planning with MRI and 68-Ga-DOTATOC-PET was evaluated. Results. Very low rates of side effects developed, including headaches, nausea and dizziness. No severe treatment-related toxicity was observed. Local control for benign meningiomas was 100%. Five of 27 patients (19%) developed tumor recurrence during follow-up. Of these, four patients had been treated as re-irradiation for recurrent high-risk meningiomas. Actuarial local control after re-irradiation of high-risk meningiomas was therefore 67% at six and 12 months. In patients treated with primary radiotherapy, only one of 13 patients (8%) developed tumor recurrence 17 months after radiation therapy (photon and carbon ion boost). Conclusion. Continuous prospective follow-up and development of novel study concepts are required to fully exploit the long-term clinical data after particle therapy for meningiomas. To date, it may be concluded that when proton therapy is available, meningioma patients can be offered a treatment at least comparable to high-end photon therapy.Copyright © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded,0.22804362
419,1657,"Loss of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 causes increased tumour latency in p53-deficient mice PARP-1-deficient mice display a severe defect in the base excision repair pathway leading to radiosensitivity and genomic instability. They are protected against necrosis induced by massive oxidative stress in various inflammatory processes. Mice lacking p53 are highly predisposed to malignancy resulting from defective cell cycle checkpoints, resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis as well as from upregulation of the iNOS gene resulting in chronic oxidative stress. Here, we report the generation of doubly null mutant mice. We found that tumour-free survival of parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice increased by 50% compared with that of parp- 1(+/+)p53(-/-) mice. Tumour formation in nude mice injected with oncogenic parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) fibroblasts was significantly delayed compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) cells. Upon gamma-irradiation, a partial restoration of S-phase radiosensitivity was found in parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) primary fibroblasts compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) cells. In addition, iNOS expression and nitrite release were dramatically reduced in the parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) mice. The abrogation of the oxydated status of p53(-/-) cells, due to the absence of parp-1, may be the cause of the delay in the onset of tumorigenesis in parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice.",Excluded,0.951364

This study aimed to compare angular changes in tooth long axes using DDMs versus using CBCTs. Settings and sample population Secondary data analysis of DDMs and CBCTs, taken before and after orthodontic treatment with piezocision of 24 patients. METHOD(S): Angular changes in tooth long axes were evaluated using landmarks on first molars (center of the occlusal surface and center of the furcation), canines and incisors (cusp tip and center of the root at the cementoenamel junction). Wilcoxon test, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots were used to test intra- and inter-rater agreement and compare DDM and CBCT measurements. RESULT(S): The mesiodistal angulation and buccolingual inclination DDM measurements were reproducible. Overall mean differences between DDM and CBCT measurements of mesiodistal angulation, 1.9degree+/-1.5degree, and buccolingual inclination, 2.2+/-2.2degree, were not significant for all teeth. ICC between DDM and CBCT measurements ranged from good (0.85 molars) to excellent (0.94 canines; 0.96 incisors). The percentages of measurements outside the range of +/-5 were 17.4% for molars, 13.8% for canines, and 4.5% for incisors. CONCLUSION(S): DDM assessment of changes in tooth long axes has good reproducibility and yields comparable measurements to those obtained from CBCT within a 5degree range. These findings lay the groundwork for machine learning approaches that synthesize crown and root canal information towards planning tooth movement without the need for ionizing radiation scans.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

423,1661,"Radiotherapy for Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors Purpose: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNTs) are rare malignant neoplasms considered to be resistant to radiotherapy (RT), although data on efficacy are scarce. We reviewed our institutional experience to further delineate the role of RT for patients with PNTs. Methods and Materials: Between 1986 and 2006, 36 patients with PNTs were treated with RT to 49 sites. Of these 36 patients, 23 had radiographic follow-up data, which were used to determine the tumor response rate and freedom from local progression. Long-term toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Result(s): The overall response rate to RT was 39% (13% complete response, 26% partial response, 56% stable disease, and 4% progressive disease). A significant difference in the freedom from local progression between the groups receiving either greater than or less than the median 2 Gy/fraction biologically equivalent dose of 49.6 Gy was found, with all radiographic progression occurring in patients who had received <=32 Gy. The actuarial 3-year local freedom from progression rate was 49%. Palliation was achieved in 90% of patients, with either improvement or resolution of symptoms after RT. Of 35 patients, 33 had metastatic disease at their referral for RT, and the median overall survival for this patient population was 2 years. Three long-term Grade 3 or greater toxicities were recorded. Conclusion(s): RT is an effective modality for achieving local control in patients with PNTs. RT produces high rates of symptomatic palliation and freedom from local progression. Prospective trials of radiotherapy for PNTs are warranted. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In such patients, TN is difficult to manage either pharmacologically and surgically. Radiosurgical rhizotomy is an effective treatment option. The nonisocentric geometry of radiation beams of CyberKnife introduces new concepts in the treatment of TN. Its efficacy for MS-related TN has not yet been demonstrated. Methods Twenty-seven patients with refractory TN and MS were treated. A nonisocentric beams distribution was chosen; the maximal target dose was 72.5 Gy. The maximal dose to the brainstem was <12 Gy. Effects on pain, medications, sensory disturbance, rate, and time of pain recurrence were analyzed. Results Median follow-up was 37 (18-72) months. Barrow Neurological Institute pain scale score I-III was achieved in 23/27 patients (85%) within 45 days. Prescription isodose line (80%) accounting for a dose of 58 Gy incorporated an average of 4.85 mm (4-6 mm) of the nerve and mean nerve volume of 26.4 mm3 (range 20-38 mm3). Seven out of 27 patients (26%) had mild, not bothersome, facial numbness (Barrow Neurological Institute numbness score II). The rate of pain control decreased progressively after the first year, and only 44% of patients retained pain control 4 years later. Conclusions Frameless radiosurgery can be effectively used to perform retrogasserian rhizotomy. Pain relief was satisfactory and, with our dose/volume constraints, no sensory complications were recorded. Nonetheless, long-term pain control was possible in less than half of the patients.

In this retrospective study, we investigated the dose prescription pattern use in the United States for patients receiving SBRT. Method(s): Patients with stage I NSCLC treated with SBRT between 2004 and 2011 were identified within the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Trends in SBRT use and dose prescriptions were analyzed. Result(s): A total of 5246 patients met criteria as receiving SBRT. The overall mean and median BED 10 were 134.5 and 132 Gy, respectively. Of these patients, 94.5% were prescribed a regimen with a BED 10 >=100 Gy. The most common prescriptions overall were 60 Gy in 3 fractions (24.1%), 48 Gy in 4 fractions (17.8%), 50 Gy in 5 fractions (13.0%), and 54 Gy in 3 fractions (12.8%). Analysis of prescription trends revealed decreased utilization of 54 to 60 Gy in 3 fractions (47.9% in 2006 to 27.9% in 2011, combined) and increased utilization of 50 Gy in 5 fractions (3.1% in 2006 to 20.4% in 2011). Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest increasing use of SBRT over the last decade with a majority of patients being treated with regimens employing a BED 10 >=100 Gy. Since 2006, there has been a decline in the use of 54 to 60 Gy in 3 fractions, with an increase in the use of 50 Gy in 5 fractions. Possible explanations include concern for increased toxicity with higher BED regimens and increasing treatment of centrally located tumors.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded,0.17240407

The need for repeat PCI has been significantly reduced in patients since the advent of vascular brachytherapy. In-stent restenosis resulting in bifurcation presents even more of a challenge. The use of radiation therapy for the treatment of this kind of lesion has not yet been reported. The purpose of this paper is to present five cases of radiation therapy in bifurcation in-stent restenotic lesions using the intraluminal beta radiation catheter delivery system (Beta-Cath System, Novoste Corporation, Norcross, Georgia)., METHODS: We reviewed the database of patients enrolled in our Compassionate Use Registry between August 1999 and April 2002.

Following the radiation treatment, the animals were fed a 2% cholesterol diet until euthanasia at 2 (n=8) or 6 (n=16) weeks. Arteries were analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM); transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) 1, a promoter of connective tissue deposition, was also monitored., RESULTS: At 2 weeks, SEM analysis showed well-aligned endothelial cells in nonradiated segments, whereas irradiated arteries consistently contained adherent and subendothelial macrophages with focal areas of endothelial disruption. Further radiated segments at 2 weeks showed a 7-fold increase in active TGF beta-1 over nonradiated segments. At 6 weeks, there was a significant increase in plaque and vessel wall area relative to control arteries, however, no differences were noted in the density of actin-positive smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or macrophages. Similarly, no differences were noted in cell proliferation between groups as evidenced by the marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). In contrast, nonirradiated segments frequently contained cellular areas with extracellular lipid., CONCLUSION: Exposure of previously uninjured vessels to IR and hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased plaque burden and leads to more advanced plaque types. Special care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure in normal vascular segments in hypercholesterolemic patients undergoing radiation therapy.",Included,0.9625329

Romania is a region with high prevalence of HTLV-1 infection and ATLL and with low median age at diagnosis for aggressive types. We performed a retrospective analysis of post-transplant outcome in the first Romanian patients with ATLL receiving hematopoietic stem cell allotransplant. The study population included eight patients (three males, five females), with median age of 39.5 (range 26-57), with acute (one case) and lymphoma type (seven cases) that received peripheral stem cells (PBSC) from matched related (MRD) and unrelated donors (MUD) after reduced intensity conditioning. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) developed in six patients. Relapse occurred in four cases (50%) at a median time of 5-months post-transplant. Six patients died: four cases with disease-related deaths and two patients with GVHD-related deaths. The median survival post-transplant was 19.5 months (range 2.3-44.2 months). The post-transplant survival at 1-year was 62.5%, at 2-years 50%, and at 3-years 37.5%. In our opinion allogeneic transplant improves outcome in aggressive type ATLL.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie these features. We investigated the hypothesis that the mechanism of wrinkle formation may involve loss of anchoring fibrils, composed mainly of collagen VII, which are important in maintaining dermal-epidermal junction integrity. Ten volunteers with moderate to severe photodamage of dorsal forearm skin were recruited to the study. Using immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy and in situ hybridization, we compared collagen VII protein and mRNA content of photodamaged forearm skin with that of sun-protected hip and upper inner arm skin from the same subjects. Numbers of anchoring fibrils per linear microns of basement membrane (mean +/- SEM) were significantly lower in photodamaged skin (1.79 +/- 0.10) as compared with sun-protected hip (2.28 +/- 0.11) and upper inner arm skin (2.21 +/- 0.10) (P < 0.01), and similarly keratinocyte expression of collagen VII mRNA, quantitated as number of positively stained keratinocytes per high power field, was significantly reduced in photodamaged skin (6.3 +/- 2.5) as compared with sun-protected hip (20.0 +/- 5.6) and upper inner arm skin (17.7 +/- 4.9) (P < 0.001).

Using clinical observations, assessing the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level, hemoglobin concentration, platelet, white blood cell counts, proteins level, electrolytes, creatinine, urea and with the help of the endoscopy Results. Our study group includes 418 patients admitted in clinic with gastrointestinal bleeding. There is a higher prevalence of a upper gastrointestinal bleeding 80,14%(335) compared to lower gastrointestinal bleedings prevalence 19,86% (83). Etiology, for upper gastrointestinal bleeding includes: peptic ulcer 47,9%, esophageal and gastric varices 22,80%, Mallory- Weiss syndrome 4,65%, gastric cancer 2,32%, vascular ectasia 2,79%, Dieulafoy lesion 2,79%, esophageal ulcer 0,46%, jejunal bleeding 0,46%. For lower gastrointestinal bleeding etiology includes: diverticulum or diverticulosis 30,86%, hemorrhoids 18,51%, colonic polyps 14,81%, colonic cancer 7,41%, inflammatory bowel disease 4,93%,ischemic colitis 1,23%,irradiation colitis 3,70%. A 7,34% percentage of the GI bleeding didn't have an obvious cause.The mean age for UGIB was 58(+/-20) years and for LGIB 68(+/-5) years.Subjects with UGIB compared to LGIB had greater admission hemodynamic instability including tachycardia, lower blood pressure or shock. Severe anemia was present at 30% of patients with LGIB and at 52,13% of patients with UGIB. Creatinine, urea ratio was grown in UGIB. Generally a low level of protein is more common in LGIB group. For the other biological parameters evaluated there is no significant difference between UGIB group and LGIB group. Hematochezia and bloody diarrhea are most common in LGIB but they also appeared in 1,26% of UGIB. Melena appeared in 3, 57 % of LGIB (small bowel or cecal bleeding). Mortality was 11,94% in UGIB group and 6,02% in LGIC group. Resource utilization was similar in UGIB and LGIB including mean costs, length of stay and number of endoscopic procedures. Conclusions. This presentation could be useful for a rapid diagnostic and therapeutic orientation and and appreciation of the prognosis of bleeding. Is also useful for assessing the severity of the bleedingand choosing the optimal moment of endoscopy.",Excluded,0.17124037
448,1686,"An examination of radon awareness, risk communication, and radon risk reduction in a Hispanic community Purpose: Radiation risk communication is a critical component of radiation protection and the public's understanding of radiation risks and benefits. Risk communication becomes even more complicated when considering cultural and language differences. In the US, many diverse communities face risk communication challenges. We obtained radon testing data to evaluate patterns of radon testing in Allentown, the third largest city in Pennsylvania. Radon exposure is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking and is associated with over 21,000 lung cancer deaths in the US annually. It is estimated that 1 in every 15 homes in the US has elevated radon levels above the recommended action level set by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Allentown has some of the highest reported levels of indoor radon in the country, yet only a small portion of the population has tested their homes. This is true particularly among self-identified Hispanics, who make up nearly half of the city's population. This study seeks to (1) characterize the difference in testing rates between self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics in Allentown, (2) quantify the level of radon awareness and knowledge, (3) identify potential obstacles to radon testing among the Allentown population that self-identifies as Hispanic, and (4) determine whether more effective risk communication is needed. Method(s): Radon test results in Allentown were analyzed to better understand the nature of radon testing. To evaluate radon awareness and knowledge, a cross-sectional study was conducted using a face-to-face survey. This data was informative in assessing testing and mitigation practices, ethnicity, income level, age, education level, homeowner status, zip code and primary language. Result(s): Ethnicity was an independent predictor of radon awareness and knowledge. Statistically significant differences were found between the number of self-identified Hispanics (39%) and non-Hispanics (84%) who indicated that they had ever heard of radon; 13% of Hispanics and 49% of non-Hispanics knew that they lived in an area with typically high radon levels. There was a statistically significant association between self-reported ethnicity and radon testing with non-Hispanics (43%) more likely to test their homes for radon than Hispanics (32%). Conclusion(s): Individual and community understanding of the risks of exposure to radiation sources such as radon is dependent upon communication that informs and spurs appropriate action. This study demonstrates the need for culturally appropriate radon risk communication strategies targeted to a Hispanic population. Successful communication will raise awareness and knowledge that can lead to better public health protection.© 2020, Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded,0.17741808
450,1688,"Countermeasures-based Improvements in Stress, Immune System Dysregulation and Latent Herpesvirus Reactivation onboard the International Space Station - Relevance for Deep Space Missions and Terrestrial Medicine The International Space Station (ISS) has continued to evolve from an operational perspective and multiple studies have monitored both stress and the immune system of ISS astronauts. Alterations were ascribed to a potentially synergistic array of factors, including microgravity, radiation, psychological stress, and circadian misalignment. Comparing similar data across 12 years of ISS construction and operations, we report that immunity, stress, and the reactivation of latent herpesviruses have all improved in ISS astronauts. Major physiological improvements seem to have initiated approximately 2012, a period coinciding with improvements onboard ISS including cargo delivery and resupply frequency, personal communication, exercise equipment and protocols, food quality and variety, nutritional supplementation, and schedule management. We conclude that spaceflight associated immune dysregulation has been positively influenced by operational improvements and biomedical countermeasures onboard ISS. Although an operational challenge, agencies should therefore incorporate, within vehicle design limitations, these dietary, operational, and stress-relieving countermeasures into deep space mission planning. Specific countermeasures that have benefited astronauts could serve as a therapy augment for terrestrial acquired immunodeficiency patients.Copyright © 2020",Excluded,0.17885141
453,1691,"Capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment in six Chinese provinces: A cross-sectional survey Background Establishment of a hierarchical medical system is one of the major tasks outlined in China's ambitious health reform, and the ultimate success of this system depends on the treatment capacity of primary hospitals. Among the priorities of primary hospitals is the provision of quality services for chronic diseases, including diabetes, atypical and epidemic chronic disease in China. We aimed to estimate the capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment in six Chinese provinces. Methods We did a cross-sectional survey in China using qualitative and quantitative methods. First, we interviewed 24 related experts (five primary hospital principals, six general practitioner, five drug experts, five medical device experts, two clinical experts, and one health system expert) to establish the capacity standard of primary hospital for diabetes treatment in the hierarchical medical system. Next, we surveyed the treatment capacity with regards to human resources, drug supply, and medical equipment in 28 primary hospitals (17 urban and 11 rural) in six provinces in China (Shanghai, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Guizhou) between May 20 and July 12, 2016. Finally, we compared the survey results against the standard. We adopted purposive sampling, and used chi2 test and rank sum test for data analyses. Ethics approval was granted by Sichuan University, and all participants provided oral informed consent. Findings The primary hospitals surveyed had a mean of 1.76 general practitioners (SD 2.03) per million residents. The mean number of general practitioners per million residents was 1.48 (1.18) for rural hospitals and 1.92 (2.41) for urban hospitals, which were lower than the standard (2-3, based on the expert interviews and policy review). 11 (65%) urban primary hospitals provided three or more types of drugs, compared with four (36%) rural primary hospitals. Urban primary hospitals had a mean of 8.35 (SD 4.44) types of diabetes drugs and rural ones had 4.45 (3.33), although expert interviews and policy reviews indicated that primary hospitals need provide seven types of drugs that are often used in the clinic. 27 (96%) primary hospitals provided metformin, 26 (93%) sulfonylureas, 18 (64%) alphaglucosidase inhibitors, 16 (57%) insulin, 15 (54%) hypoglycaemic proprietary Chinese medicine, 11 (39%) glinides, and nine (32%) thiazolidinediones; newer antidiabetic drugs such as DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists were scarcely supplied. All 28 primary hospitals were equipped with blood glucose meters, blood pressure instruments, and electrocardiograph machines; 25 (89%) had biochemical analysers, 27 (96%) B ultrasound machines, 20 (71%) colour Doppler ultrasound machines and x-ray machines, and eight (29%) fundus mirrors, while expert interviews showed that primary hospitals should have with all of these equipment. No significant difference in availability of medical equipment was recorded between rural and urban primary hospitals (p>0.05). Interpretation Primary hospitals in China, especially those in rural areas, do not have sufficient human resources and drugs for diabetes treatment, although they generally have adequate medical equipment. Strategies to enhance the capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment need to increase the number of health-care workers and drug supply.",Excluded,0.18020296
455,1693,"Faecal microbiota transplantation protects against radiation-induced toxicity Severe radiation exposure may cause acute radiation syndrome, a possibly fatal condition requiring effective therapy. Gut microbiota can be manipulated to fight against many diseases. We explored whether intestinal microbe transplantation could alleviate radiation-induced toxicity. High-throughput sequencing showed that gastrointestinal bacterial community composition differed between male and female mice and was associated with susceptibility to radiation toxicity. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) increased the survival rate of irradiated animals, elevated peripheral white blood cell counts and improved gastrointestinal tract function and intestinal epithelial integrity in irradiated male and female mice. FMT preserved the intestinal bacterial composition and retained mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression profiles of host small intestines in a sex-specific fashion. Despite promoting angiogenesis, sex-matched FMT did not accelerate the proliferation of cancer cells in vivo. FMT might serve as a therapeutic to mitigate radiation-induced toxicity and improve the prognosis of tumour patients after radiotherapy.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

458,1696,"Therapeutic applications of PARP inhibitors: Anticancer therapy and beyond The aim of this article is to describe the current and potential clinical translation of pharmacological inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) for the therapy of various diseases. The first section of the present review summarizes the available preclinical and clinical data with PARP inhibitors in various forms of cancer. In this context, the role of PARP in single-strand DNA break repair is relevant, leading to replication-associated lesions that cannot be repaired if homologous recombination repair (HRR) is defective, and the synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors in HRR-defective cancer. HRR defects are classically associated with BRCA1 and 2 mutations associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer, but there may be many other causes of HRR defects. Thus, PARP inhibitors may be the drugs of choice for BRCA mutant breast and ovarian cancers, and extend beyond these tumors if appropriate biomarkers can be developed to identify HRR defects. Multiple lines of preclinical data demonstrate that PARP inhibition increases cytotoxicity and tumor growth delay in combination with temozolomide, topoisomerase inhibitors and ionizing radiation. Both single agent and combination clinical trials are underway. The final part of the first section of the present review summarizes the current status of the various PARP inhibitors that are in various stages of clinical development. The second section of the present review summarizes the role of PARP in selected non-oncologic indications. In a number of severe, acute diseases (such as stroke, neurotrauma, circulatory shock and acute myocardial infarction) the clinical translatability of PARP inhibition is supported by multiple lines of preclinical data, as well as observational data demonstrating PARP activation in human tissue samples. In these disease indications, PARP overactivation due to oxidative and nitrative stress drives cell necrosis and pro-inflammatory gene expression, which contributes to disease pathology. Accordingly, multiple lines of preclinical data indicate the efficacy of PARP inhibitors to preserve viable tissue and to down-regulate inflammatory responses. As the clinical trials with PARP inhibitors in various forms of cancer progress, it is hoped that a second line of clinical investigations, aimed at testing of PARP inhibitors for various non-oncologic indications, will be initiated, as well. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

459,1697,"The effect of body mass index on fluoroscopic time and radiation dose during lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections OBJECTIVE: Transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESIs) are a commonly used, effective treatment for radicular pain. Accurate delivery of the injected medication helps to ensure maximum therapeutic efficacy and to decrease possible adverse events, and fluoroscopy is the preferred and most common image-guidance modality used to ensure accurate needle placement during lumbar TFESIs. However, fluoroscopic-guided lumbar TFESIs put patients at risk because of radiation exposure. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and fluoroscopy time and radiation dose during lumbar TFESIs., DESIGN: A retrospective study design was used., SETTING: The study was conducted at an academic orthopedic center. All procedures were performed by physicians board-certified in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) and with subspecialty certification in sports medicine, or by a trainee under close supervision from an attending physician., PARTICIPANTS: Participants were patients who underwent fluoroscopic-guided lumbar TFESIs between February 2013 and March 2015 with a documented height/weight, fluoroscopy time, and radiation dose., INTERVENTIONS: All patients received unilateral or bilateral lumbar TFESIs with fluoroscopic guidance. Fluoroscopy time and dose were recorded., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were fluoroscopy time and radiation dose. A Bonferroni correction was implemented for multiple comparisons, defining statistical significance at p<.01., RESULTS: A total of 2,443 injections were performed on 1,548 patients. There were 419 normal, 572 overweight, and 557 obese patients, respectively. There were 1,426 first-time injections and 1,017 repeat injections. Sixty-nine percent (1,681) were unilateral injections, and 26.4% (645) were single level injections. A trainee was involved in 1,361 (55.7%) of the injections performed. The mean fluoroscopy time for all injections was 30.0+/-17.5 seconds, and the mean radiation dose was 2,164+/-1,484 mGy-cm(2). The mean fluoroscopy time was 27.7+/-15.2 seconds for normal weight patients, 30.0+/-21.0 seconds for overweight patients, and 32.2+/-15.1 seconds for obese patients, showing a significant difference between groups (p<.001). The mean radiation doses for each group were 1,376+/-450, 1,911+/-653, and 3,029+/-640 mGy-cm(2), respectively, with a significant increase in radiation dose with increasing BMI (p<.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study demonstrate that fluoroscopy radiation dose and fluoroscopy time during lumbar TFESIs are increased in patients with an elevated BMI, and in patients of greater age, but the presence of a trainee had no effect on fluoroscopy time.

460,1698,"Dynamic CT for Parathyroid Adenoma Detection: How Does Radiation Dose Compare With Nuclear Medicine? OBJECTIVE: Dynamic CT is increasingly used for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas, but concerns remain about the radiation effective dose of CT compared with that of 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation dose delivered by three-phase dynamic CT with that delivered by 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT performed in accordance with our current protocols and to assess the possible reduction in effective dose achieved by decreasing the scan length (i.e., z-axis) of two phases of the dynamic CT protocol., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effective dose of a 99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine parathyroid study performed with and without coregistration CT was calculated and compared with the effective dose of our current three-phase dynamic CT protocol as well as a proposed protocol involving CT with reduced scan length., RESULTS: The median effective dose for a 99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine study was 5.6 mSv. This increased to 12.4 mSv with the addition of coregistration CT, which is higher than the median effective dose of 9.3 mSv associated with the dynamic CT protocol. Reducing the scan length of two phases in the dynamic CT protocol could reduce the median effective dose to 6.1 mSv, which would be similar to that of the dose from the 99mTc-sestamibi study alone., CONCLUSION: Dynamic CT used for the detection of parathyroid adenoma can deliver a lower radiation dose than 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT. It may be possible to reduce the dose further by decreasing the scan length of two of the phases, although whether this has an impact on accuracy of the localization needs further investigation.",Excluded,0.17200594
462,1700,"Three phenotype profiles are revealed by cluster analysis in early inflammatory back pain suggestive of spondyloarthritis (SPA). Results from the devenir des spondyloarthropathies indifferenciEes rEcentes (DESIR) cohort Background Spondylarthritis (SPA) spectrum refers to a variety of skeletal and extra-articular inflammatory manifestations that may combine differently among patients. Objectives To examine whether SPA disease manifestations at baseline would combine according to an ordered or random pattern in patients with early inflammatory low back pain (IBP) and suggestive of SPA. Methods Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics, as well as imaging (i.e. pelvic X-rays, pelvic MRI and peripheral entheses ultrasound) and biological data (including HLA-B27) of patients included in the French multicenter DESIR cohort of early (<3 yrs duration) IBP suggestive of SPA were analysed by multiple correspondence analysis in order to graphically assess the association between the studied manifestations. Several methods of cluster analysis using those variables were then performed to identify subgroups of patients with similar characteristics. Results Seven hundred and eight patients were included into the Cohort. Among the 700 analysed patients cluster analysis allowed us to classify 688 patients in 3 major groups (table 1). Cluster A contained a majority of men, with predominant isolated axial manifestations, and higher frequency of uveitis and positivity of HLA-B27. Cluster B predominantly consisted of women, with higher frequency of peripheral signs (including vascularisation at entheses by power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS)), psoriasis and younger onset of disease symptoms. Cluster C was composed by patients with predominant axial symptoms, equal distribution of sex, highest presence of pelvic X-rays and MRI positivity, and higher prevalence of HLA-B27 positivity. (Table presented) Conclusions Cluster analysis of SPA manifestations among patients with early IBP allowed us to clearly identify at baseline 3 different groups of clinical phenotypes. Ongoing follow up will allow to determine whether these clusters may correspond to different severity patterns.",Excluded,0.17631474

467,1705,"A randomized double-blind controlled trial: Impact of probiotics on diarrhea in patients treated with pelvic radiation Background & aims: Radical radiation therapy is commonly used for treatment of pelvic cancer. Up to 80% of patients receiving radiotherapy will develop acute radiation induced diarrhea. The primary aim of this randomized double blind controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of the probiotic Bifilact on moderate and severe treatment-induced diarrhea during pelvic radiation. Method(s): Patients with pelvic cancers were treated between 2006 and 2010 at L'HOtel-Dieu de Quebec, University Health Center. Some patients had surgery before pelvic radiotherapy and some received chemotherapy. A total of 246 Patients were randomized between a placebo and either of two regiments of double strain Bifilact probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus LAC-361 and Bifidobacterium longum BB-536): a standard dose twice a day (1.3 billion CFU) or a high dose three times a day (10 billion CFU). Patients were trained to record their digestive symptoms daily with a standardized scale and they met a registered dietician and radiation oncologist every week during treatment. The main analysis compared time to first appearance of grade >=2-3-4 diarrhea using Kaplan-Meier curves as measured by proportion of patients without moderate and severe diarrhea. Result(s): 229 patients were analyzed. The difference between the groups for overall grade 2-3-4 diarrhea was not statistically significant (p=0.13). However at 60 days, the proportion of patients without moderate and severe diarrhea in the standard dose group (35%) was more than twice as high as that of the placebo group (17%) with a hazard ratio of 0.69 (p=0.04). In patients who had surgery, the standard probiotics dose group had a better proportion of patients without very severe diarrhea than the placebo group, respectively 97% and 74% (p=0.03). In all groups, the average number of bowel movements per day during treatment was less than 3 soft stools (p=0.80) and the median abdominal pain less than 1 based on the National Cancer Institute scale (p=0.23). Conclusion(s): Standard dose of Bifilact may reduce radiation induced grade 2-3-4 diarrhea at the end of the treatment of patients with pelvic cancer. In patients operated on before RT, a standard dose of probiotics may reduce radiation induced grade 4 diarrhea. Nutritional interventions by a registered dietician seemed to reduce global digestive symptoms. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov.

468,1706,"Conditional survival among patients with oropharyngeal cancer treated with radiation therapy and alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis Background: Risk of recurrence among patients with oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) who survive 5 years is low. The goal of this study was to assess long-term survival of patients with OPC alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis. Method(s): This study included newly diagnosed patients with OPC, who had been treated with radiation and were alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis. Overall survival (OS) probabilities beyond 5 years were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Factors associated with OS were determined using Bayesian piecewise exponential survival regression. Standardized mortality ratios for all-cause death were estimated controlling for study year, age, and sex in the US general population. Result(s): Among 1699 patients, the additional 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year OS probabilities were 94%, 83%, and 63%, respectively, and were lower than those in the general population. Patients who were older, were current or former smokers, had other than tonsil or base of tongue tumors, or had T4 tumors had a higher risk of death. Patients who had base of tongue tumors and had received intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or lower-radiation doses had a lower risk of death. Standardized mortality ratios were higher among current and heavy smokers and lower among recipients of IMRT and lower radiation doses. Conclusion(s): In this large cohort, long-term survival among patients with OPC was good but lower than predicted for the general population. Patients treated with IMRT and those with less tobacco exposure had better outcomes.Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society",Excluded,0.18215163

Additionally, cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell apoptosis were all analyzed in irradiated or sham-irradiated cells., RESULTS: Among the five antisense compounds (AS), AS3 was identified to efficiently inhibit p53 mRNA level and protein content. Interestingly, AS3 transfer has little effect on cell proliferation in DU-145 cells (mutant p53) after ionizing radiation (IR). In contrast, a marked increase of cell apoptosis and growth inhibition were observed in MCF-7 cells (wild-type p53), suggesting that AS3 can increase radiosensitivity of MCF-7 cells. Additionally, it was also observed that the transfection of AS3 decreased the fraction of G1 phase cells, and increased the proportion of S phase cells compared to untreated cells 24 h after IR in MCF-7 cell lines., CONCLUSION: AS3 transfection increases MCF-7 cell apoptosis induced by 5 Gy-radiation, and this mechanism may be closely associated with abrogation of G1 phase arrest.",Included,0.95459384
471,1709,"Surgical management of osteoradionecrosis of the jaws OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate our 10-year clinical experience in surgical management of patients with osteoradionecrosis (ORN) unresolved with conservative nonoperative treatment., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 120 patients who had been surgically treated for ORN during a 10-year period (January 2003 to January 2013) were retrospectively reviewed., RESULTS: The most predilection ORN site was mandible (82.5%), followed by the maxilla (11.7%). ORN developed within initial 12 months in 39.2% and within the first 3 years in 68.3%. The median radiation dose was 68.1 Gy (range, 35-148 Gy), but 51 patients (42.5%) experienced ORN even though radiation doses were controlled under 60 Gy. Surgical trauma, as we believed, was the most important factor leading to this result. Among all the patients, 12 (10.0%) patients were found ineligible for operative treatment due to comorbid systematic diseases whereas none healed or improved. In terms of surgical management of the rest of the 108 patients, 90 (75.0%) patients underwent radical resection (4 patients unhealed), and 18 (15.0%) patients underwent mild surgical procedures such as sequestrectomy or debridement (1 patient unhealed). Of the 90 radical resection patients, 58 patients underwent radical resections and immediate microvascular flap reconstruction (19 bone flaps and 39 soft flaps), and 32 patients only experience radical resection (5 patients received second-stage reconstruction). According to follow-up information, 55 patients were free of disease., CONCLUSION: Though priority should be given to surgical treatment for the patient whose ORN does not respond to conservative nonoperative treatment, we may as well take into account more individualized regimens based on ORN severity. A hard lesson learned from our article is that the oral maxillofacial surgeon should minimize the trauma for jaws as possible as he can, especially to patients who need to receive postoperative radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.17314516
472,1710,"Towards improved prognostic scores predicting survival in patients with brain metastases: A pilot study of serum lactate dehydrogenase levels Accurate prognostic information is desirable when counselling patients with brain metastases regarding their therapeutic options and life expectancy. Based on previous studies, we selected serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a promising factor on which we perform a pilot study investigating methodological aspects of biomarker studies in patients with brain metastases, before embarking on large-scale studies that will look at a larger number of candidate markers in an expanded patient cohort. For this retrospective analysis, 100 patients with available information on LDH treated with palliative whole-brain radiotherapy were selected. A comprehensive evaluation of different LDH-based variables was performed in uni- and multivariate tests. Probably, the most intriguing finding was that LDH kinetics might be more important, or at least complement, information obtained from a single measurement immediately before radiotherapy. LDH and performance status outperformed several other variables that are part of prognostic models such as recursive partitioning analyses classes and graded prognostic assessment score. LDH kinetics might reflect disease behaviour in extracranial metastatic and primary sites without need for comprehensive imaging studies and is a quite inexpensive diagnostic test. Based on these encouraging results, confirmatory studies in a larger cohort of patients are warranted. Copyright 2012 Carsten Nieder et al.",Excluded,0.17418806
473,1711,"CT-Urography In this paper we present an overview of CT-Urography. With the advent of multislice CT scanners and the evolution of image processing methods this technique now affords optimal urographic images comparable to those obtained with conventional techniques. We describe the acquisition techniques and protocols used by the various authors. Effective radiation dose has conditioned the use of CT-Urography so that the tendency today is to reduce the number of scans by performing, after the nonenhanced scan, a single contrast-enhanced scan comprising both the nephrographic and urographic phase. With the use of multislice CT the quality of the urogram improves with the number of slices. We illustrate a variety of processing techniques, multiplanar reconstruction (MPR), maximum (MIP) and average intensity projection (AIP) and volume rendering (VR) and present a series of upper urinary tract tumours testifying to the superiority of the AIP technique over MIP. We then review the results of comparative studies of CT-Urography with conventional urography in upper urinary tract diagnostics.

474,1712,"Patterns of diagnostic imaging and associated radiation exposure among long-term survivors of young adult cancer: a population-based cohort study BACKGROUND: Survivors of young adult malignancies are at risk of accumulated exposures to radiation from repetitive diagnostic imaging. We designed a population-based cohort study to describe patterns of diagnostic imaging and cumulative diagnostic radiation exposure among survivors of young adult cancer during a survivorship time period where surveillance imaging is not typically warranted., METHODS: Young adults aged 20-44 diagnosed with invasive malignancy in Ontario from 1992-1999 who lived at least 5 years from diagnosis were identified using the Ontario Cancer Registry and matched 5 to 1 to randomly selected cancer-free persons. We determined receipt of 5 modalities of diagnostic imaging and associated radiation dose received by survivors and controls from years 5-15 after diagnosis or matched referent date through administrative data. Matched pairs were censored six months prior to evidence of recurrence., RESULTS: 20,911 survivors and 104,524 controls had a median of 13.5 years observation. Survivors received all modalities of diagnostic imaging at significantly higher rates than controls. Survivors received CT at a 3.49-fold higher rate (95% Confidence Interval [CI]:3.37, 3.62) than controls in years 5 to 15 after diagnosis. Survivors received a mean radiation dose of 26 miliSieverts solely from diagnostic imaging in the same time period, a 4.57-fold higher dose than matched controls (95% CI: 4.39, 4.81)., CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survivors of young adult cancer have a markedly higher rate of diagnostic imaging over time than matched controls, imaging associated with substantial radiation exposure, during a time period when surveillance is not routinely recommended.",Excluded,0.81917137

Local control data were available for 27 patients: 22% had a complete response, 26% had a partial response, 15% showed progressive disease, and 37% showed static disease. Median overall survival for all 31 patients was 70 days (95% confidence interval, 40-99). There was no significant difference in median survival between patients younger (70 days) and older than 70 years (42 days), between men (70 days) and women (49 days), and between patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy (77 days) and radical radiotherapy alone (35 days). Grade III or higher skin erythema was seen in 56% patients; desquamation in 21%; dysphagia in 74%; and esophagitis in 79%., CONCLUSION: The current protocol failed to offer a significant survival benefit, was associated with severe toxicities, and thus was discontinued. There is a suggestion that younger patients with operable disease have longer survival, but this would require a larger study to confirm it.",Excluded,0.17376739
477,1715,"Flexible Modeling of the Association between Cumulative Exposure to Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation from Cardiac Procedures and Risk of Cancer in Adults with Congenital Heart Disease Adults with congenital heart disease are increasingly being exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) from cardiac procedures. In a recent study, Cohen et al. (Circulation. 2018;137(13):1334-1345) reported an association between increased LDIR exposure and cancer incidence but did not explore temporal relationships. Yet, the impact of past exposures probably accumulates over years, and its strength may depend on the amount of time elapsed since exposure. Furthermore, LDIR procedures performed shortly before a cancer diagnosis may have been ordered because of early symptoms of cancer, raising concerns about reversal causality bias. To address these challenges, we combined flexible modeling of cumulative exposures with competing-risks methodology to estimate separate associations of time-varying LDIR exposure with cancer incidence and all-cause mortality. Among 24,833 patients from the Quebec Congenital Heart Disease Database, 602 had incident cancer and 500 died during a follow-up period of up to 15 years (1995-2010). Initial results suggested a strong association of cancer incidence with very recent LDIR exposures, likely reflecting reverse causality bias. When exposure was lagged by 2 years, an increased cumulative LDIR dose from the previous 2-6 years was associated with increased cancer incidence, with a stronger association for women. These results illustrate the importance of accurate modeling of temporal relationships between time-varying exposures and health outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

480,1718,"Impact of VMAT-IMRT compared to 3D conformal radiotherapy on anal sphincter dose distribution in neoadjuvant chemoradiation of rectal cancer Background: Neoadjuvant radio- or chemoradiation (nIRT) therapy is the standard treatment for loco-regional advanced rectal cancer patients of the lower or middle third. Currently, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is not the recommended radiation technique even though IMRT has advantages compared to 3D-radiation regarding dose sparing to organs at risk like small bowel and urinary bladder. So far, the benefit of IMRT concerning the anal sphincter complex is not examined. With this study we intended to evaluate the dose distribution on the anal sphincters of rectal cancer patients treated with IMRT in comparison with 3D-techniques. Method(s): We selected 16 patients for the IMRT-group and 16 patients for the 3D-group with rectal cancer of the middle third who were treated in our institute. All patients received 45 Gy in a chemoradiation protocol. Patients in both groups were matched regarding stage, primary tumor distance to the anal verge and size of the tumor. We delineated the internal and external anal sphincters, the addition of both sphincters and the levator ani muscle in all patients. Subsequently, we evaluated and compared dose parameters of the different sphincters in both groups and analysed the configuration of the isodoses in the area of the caudal radiation field, respectively. Result(s): Most of the relevant dose parameters of the caudal sphincters (Dmean, Dmedian, V10-V40) were significantly reduced in the IMRT-group compared to the 3D-group. Accordingly, the isodoses at the caudal edge of the target volume in the IMRT group demonstrated a steep dose fall. The levator ani muscle always was included into the planned target volumes and received the full dose in both groups. Conclusion(s): The modern VMAT-IMRT can significantly reduce the dose to the anal sphincters for rectal cancer patients of the middle third who were treated with conventional chemoradiation therapy.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded,0.17176127

484,1722,"Vitamin D improves sunburns by increasing autophagy in M2 macrophages Cutaneous inflammation from UV radiation exposure causes epidermal damage, cellular infiltration, and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators that exacerbate tissue destruction. Recovery is mediated chiefly by anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages that suppress inflammation and augment epidermal regeneration. Vitamin D enables anti-inflammation to promote tissue repair in response to injury. Since vitamin D enhances cellular macroautophagy/autophagy, we investigated the role of autophagy in vitamin D protection of UV-mediated sunburn and inflammation. Using a UV-mediated acute skin injury mouse model, we demonstrate that a single dose of vitamin D resolves injury with sustained inhibition of inflammatory cytokines associated with enhanced autophagy in myeloid anti-inflammatory M2 macs. Increased MAP1LC3B/LC3 expression corroborated with complete autolysosome formation detected by electron microscopy and correlated with degradation of SQSTM1/p62 in the skin following vitamin D treatment. Specifically, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy increased UV-induced apoptosis, suppressed M2 macs recruitment, and prevented vitamin D downregulation of Tnf and Mmp9 in the skin. Furthermore, selective deletion of autophagy in myeloid cells of atg7 cKO mice abrogated vitamin D-mediated protection and recapitulated UV-induced inflammation. Mechanistically, vitamin D signaling activated M2-autophagy regulators Klf4, Pparg, and Arg1. Lastly, analysis of UV-exposed human skin biopsies detected a similar increase in macrophage autophagy following vitamin D intervention, identifying an essential role for autophagy in vitamin D-mediated protection of skin from UV damage.

489,1727,"Suppression of voluntary motor activity revealed using transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex in man 1. Suppression of voluntary muscle activity of hand and arm muscles in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex has been investigated in man. 2. Suppression could be elicited by low levels of TMS without any prior excitatory response. The latency of the suppression was 3-8 ms longer than the excitation observed at a higher stimulus intensity. The duration of the suppression ranged from 8 to 26 ms. 3. A circular stimulating coil was used to determine threshold intensity for excitation and suppression of contraction of thenar muscles in response to TMS at different locations over the motor cortex. The locations for lowest threshold excitation coincided with those for lowest threshold suppression. Suppression was elicited at a lower threshold than excitation at all locations. 4. A figure-of-eight stimulating coil was positioned over the left motor cortex at the lowest threshold point for excitation of the right thenar muscles. The orientation for the lowest threshold excitatory and inhibitory responses was the same for all subjects. That orientation induced a stimulating current travelling in an antero-medial direction. Suppression was invariably elicited at lower thresholds than excitation. 5. When antagonistic muscles (second and third dorsal interosseus) were co-contracted, TMS evoked coincident suppression of voluntary EMG in the two muscles without prior excitation of either muscle. This suggests that the suppression is not mediated via corticospinal activation of spinal interneurones. 6. Test responses to electrical stimulation of the cervical spinal cord were evoked in both relaxed and activated thenar muscles. In the relaxed muscle, prior TMS at an intensity that would suppress voluntary activity failed to influence the test responses, suggesting absence of inhibition at a spinal level. However, in the activated muscle, prior TMS could reduce the test response. This may be explained by disfacilitation of motoneurones due to inhibition of corticospinal output. 7. We propose that suppression of voluntary muscle activity by TMS is due in large part to activation of a mechanism within the motor cortex that reduces the corticospinal output to the muscle. It is concluded that TMS evokes excitation and inhibition via neuronal structures lying close to one another and having similar orientations.",Excluded,0.18050052
491,1729,"Medical diagnostic radiation exposures and risk of gliomas High-dose ionizing radiation is an established risk factor for glioma, but it remains unknown whether moderate- and low-dose radiation increase glioma risk. In this analysis, we assessed the evidence that self-reported exposures to diagnostic ionizing radiation, including computerized tomography (CT) scans, is associated with increased risk of adult glioma. While no independent association was observed for CT scans alone (3+ scans compared to none P = 0.08 and 1-2 scans compared to none P = 0.68), our findings suggest an increased risk of adult gliomas with cumulative exposure to three or more CT scans to the head and neck region (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 0.92-4.23) limited to those who reported a family history of cancer: the P value for the interaction between having three or more CT scans and family history of cancer was 0.08. The stratum-specific adjusted OR for those with family history of cancer was more than three times that for the sub-group without family history of cancer. While there is some potential for symptom-related bias, one might expect this to be present for all diagnostic procedures rather than specific to one procedure. The interaction between CT scans and glioma with family history of cancer supports the biological plausibility of our findings, because similar results have been found for breast cancer and radiation. This observational data will increase awareness about potential risks associated with CT scans and the need to minimize the use of unnecessary examinations.",Excluded,0.8420774

Carbon dioxide laser is an established procedure for the treatment of non-malignant cricopharyngeal disorders. We report our experience of laser cricopharyngeal myotomy with objective swallowing outcome measures, before and after treatment., METHODS: We identified 11 patients who had undergone carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy for dysphagia following radiotherapy, with or without chemotheraphy between January 2006 and July 2011. We analysed the swallowing outcomes following carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy by retrospective grading of pre- and post-procedure videofluoroscopic swallowing study of liquids, using the validated Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile., RESULTS: The median Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile score was 13 pre-myotomy and 10 post-myotomy. This difference between scores was non-significant (p = 0.41). The median, cricopharyngeal-specific Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile variables (14 and 17) improved from 3 to 2, but were similarly non-significant (p = 0.16).

496,1734,"Astronaut EVA exposure estimates from CAD model spacesuit geometry Ongoing assembly and maintenance activities at the International Space Station (ISS) require much more extravehicular activity (EVA) than did the earlier U.S. Space Shuttle missions. It is thus desirable to determine and analyze, and possibly foresee, as accurately as possible what radiation exposures crew members involved in EVAs will experience in order to minimize risks and to establish exposure limits that must not to be exceeded. A detailed CAD model of the U.S. Space Shuttle EVA Spacesuit, developed at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC), is used to represent the directional shielding of an astronaut; it has detailed helmet and backpack structures, hard upper torso, and multilayer space suit fabric material. The NASA Computerized Anatomical Male and Female (CAM and CAF) models are used in conjunction with the space suit CAD model for dose evaluation within the human body. The particle environments are taken from the orbit-averaged NASA AP8 and AE8 models at solar cycle maxima and minima. The transport of energetic particles through space suit materials and body tissue is calculated by using the NASA LaRC HZETRN code for hadrons and a recently developed deterministic transport code, ELTRN, for electrons. The doses within the CAM and CAF models are determined from energy deposition at given target points along 968 directional rays convergent on the points and are evaluated for several points on the skin and within the body. Dosimetric quantities include contributions from primary protons, light ions, and electrons, as well as from secondary brehmsstrahlung and target fragments.

These patients are often referred to Interventional Radiology for alternative percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement options. Purpose: To report our experience with CT fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous gastrostomy with a novel loop gastropexy and peel-away sheath trocar technique in ALS patients as an alternative to endoscopic techniques. Material and Methods: A consecutive series of 31 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients in whom endoscopic gastrostomy was considered too dangerous or impossible to perform underwent CT-guided percutaneous gastropexy and gastrostomy and prospective follow-up. All procedures were performed with a 15 FR Frekaw Pexact gastrostomy kit, a 16-row CT scanner (Aquilion 16) and single shot CT fluoroscopy mode. Results: The procedure was performed successfully in 30 of 31 patients (20 men, 11 women; median age 60 years, range 38-80 years). In the remaining case the stomach was punctured under CT fluoroscopy and CO2 insufflation was initiated thereafter, leading to successful gastrostomy without prior gastropexy and without further adverse events during follow-up. Two patients reported unproblematic exchange of a balloon tube due to skin irritations with no further adverse events. One patient reported accidental displacement of an exchanged new balloon tube in domestic environment due to balloon leakage: A new balloon tube was easily re-inserted in a hospital the same day. No serious adverse events such as peritonitis, persistent local bleeding, systemic blood loss, or any local infection requiring surgical intervention were observed. Until August 11, 2011 follow-up resulted in 7473 cumulative gastrostomy-days from the date of first placement.

Images were acquired with a maximum interval of 3 mo between them and were analyzed with masking by separate teams. Planar whole-body imaging and SPECT/CT were performed from thorax to pelvis using a double-head 16-slice SPECT/CT scanner 4 h after injection of 111-185 MBq of 99mTc-HYNIC-octreotide. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT was performed from head to feet using a 16-slice PET/CT scanner 45 min after injection of 185 MBq of tracer. WB DWI was performed in the coronal plane using a 1.5-T scanner and a body coil. The standard method of reference for evaluation of image performance was undertaken: consensus among investigators at the end of the study, clinical and imaging follow-up, and biopsy of suggestive lesions., There are different metabolic imaging methods, various tracers, and emerging anatomic modalities to stage neuroendocrine tumor (NET). We aimed to compare NET lesion detectability among 99mTc-hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC)-octreotide (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy [SSRS]) SPECT/CT, 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, and whole-body diffusion-weighted MR imaging (WB DWI)., Results: McNemar testing was applied to evaluate the detectability of lesions using 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT in comparison to SSRS SPECT/CT and WB DWI: a significant difference in detectability was noted for pancreas (P = 0.0455 and P = 0.0455, respectively), gastrointestinal tract (P = 0.0455 and P = 0.0455), and bones (P = 0.0082 and P = 0.0082). Two unknown primary lesions were identified solely by 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, SSRS SPECT/CT, and WB DWI demonstrated, respectively, sensitivities of 0.96, 0.60, and 0.72; specificities of 0.97, 0.99, and 1.00; positive predictive values of 0.94, 0.96, and 1.00; negative predictive values of 0.98, 0.83, and 0.88; and accuracies of 0.97, 0.86, and 0.91., Conclusion: 68Ga PET/CT seems to be more sensitive for detection of well-differentiated NET lesions, especially for bone and unknown primary lesions. NET can be staged with 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. WB DWI is an efficient new method with high accuracy and without ionizing radiation exposure.

502,1740,"Sunscreen protection against cis-urocanic acid production in human skin Commercial sunscreens may offer some protection from immunosuppression induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, but agreement concerning the degree of protection is lacking. Cis-urocanic acid, formed by the photoisomerization of transurocanic acid is considered an important mediator of the cutaneous immunomodulation resulting from exposure to UV radiation. We investigated the effect of sunscreens on the isomerization of urocanic acid in 17 human subjects. Two sunscreens containing chemical filters, sun protection factor (SPF) 4 and SPF 10, and a SPF 10 sunscreen with a physical filter were applied at a thickness of 2 mg/cm2. The effect of a thin layer (0.5 mg/cm2) of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was also evaluated, as the amount of sunscreen applied in practice may be considerably less than recommended. All areas were irradiated with a single UV dose of 3.6 SED (standard erythema doses). In irradiated unprotected skin the median net production of cis-urocanic acid was 52% (relative amount). In the sites treated with the chemical sunscreens, the production of cis-urocanic acid was 7.4% (SPF 4) and 3.5% (SPF 10), and isomerization was thus reduced more efficiently at a higher SPF (p<0.01). The physical sunscreen reduced the formation of cis-UCA to 15%, and was significantly less effective than both the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen (p<0.01) and the SPF 4 sunscreen (p<0.01). The production of cis-urocanic acid in the area treated with the thin layer of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was 22%.

We hypothesized that baseline quantifiable radiologic features and their short-term interval change may be predictive of underlying histologic diagnosis as well as long-term survival in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) presenting without honeycombing versus nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). Material(s) and Method(s): Forty biopsy-confirmed IPF and 20 biopsy-confirmed NSIP patients with available high-resolution chest computed tomography 4 to 24 months apart were studied. CALIPER software was used for the automated characterization and quantification of radiologic findings. Result(s): IPF subjects were older (66 vs. 48; P<0.0001) with lower diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and higher volumes of baseline reticulation (193 vs. 83 mL; P<0.0001). Over the interval period, compared with NSIP, IPF patients experienced greater functional decline (forced vital capacity, -6.3% vs. -1.7%; P=0.02) and radiologic progression, as noted by greater increase in reticulation volume (24 vs. 1.74 mL; P=0.048), and decrease in normal (-220 vs. -37.7 mL; P=0.045) and total lung volumes (-198 vs. 58.1 mL; P=0.03). Older age, male gender, higher reticulation volumes at baseline, and greater interval decrease in normal lung volumes were predictive of IPF. Both baseline and short-term changes in quantitative radiologic findings were predictive of mortality. Conclusion(s): Baseline quantitative radiologic findings and assessment of short-term disease progression may help characterize underlying IPF versus NSIP in those with difficult to differentiate clinicoradiologic presentations. Our study supports the possible utility of assessing serial quantifiable high-resolution chest computed tomographic findings for disease differentiation in these 2 entities.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Ninety-four patients (46 patients having abdominoperineal resections (APR), and 48 having anterior resections) did not receive radiation therapy. Sixty-one patients had preoperative radiation therapy followed by APR in 59 cases. Univariate analysis showed that the risk of local recurrence increased significantly with male sex (p less than 0.006), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), vascular invasion (p less than 0.02), and Astler-Coller classification (p less than 0.05).

Method(s): We reviewed the clinical data of 430 consecutive patients enrolled in a prospective nonrandomized study to evaluate FB-EVAR from 2013 to 2020. The outcomes were analyzed for patients with extent I to IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms who had undergone FB-EVAR with distal implantation in the native infrarenal aorta. The minimum anatomic criteria for the use of infrarenal aortic seal was a >3-cm length of parallel aorta with a diameter of 18 to 32 mm without excessive thrombus or calcification. A control group matched for the extent of aortic disease with an iliac artery seal was used to compare the following endpoints: 30-day mortality, major adverse events, freedom from type Ib endoleak (TIbE), freedom from secondary interventions, and changes in the infrarenal aortic diameter. Result(s): A total of 110 patients (55 men; mean age, 73 +/- 8 years) were included in the present study, 55 with an infrarenal aortic distal seal and 55 with the iliac arteries as the sealing zone. Both groups had similar clinical characteristics and aneurysm extent and diameter, except for a greater number of men and higher serum creatinine in the iliac seal group. Technical success was obtained in 106 patients (96%) and was greater for the iliac sealing zone group (100% vs 93%; P = .04).

Among the patients treated with infrarenal aortic sealing zones, the mean enlargement of the infrarenal aortic diameter was 5 +/- 3.2 mm at 3 years. No late TIbE due to disease progression had developed in the infrarenal aorta. Conclusion(s): Infrarenal aortic and iliac artery seal zones are safe and effective during FB-EVAR, provided the patients have suitable segments. The use of the infrarenal aortic sealing zone had modest procedural advantages such as shorter endovascular and fluoroscopy times and lower radiation exposure. No differences were found in the clinical outcomes or development of TIbEs.Copyright © 2021 Society for Vascular Surgery",Excluded,0.17326939
510,1748,"The association of residential altitude on the molecular profile and survival of melanoma: Results of an interreg study Cutaneous melanoma (CM) incidence is rising worldwide and is the primary cause of death from skin disease in the Western world. Personal risk factors linked to environmental ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are well-known etiological factors contributing to its development. Nevertheless, UVR can contribute to the development of CM in different patterns and to varying degrees. The present study aimed at investigating whether altitude of residence can contribute to the development of specific types of CM and/or influence its progression. To this aim, 306 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from primary CM diagnosed in different geographical areas were submitted to B-RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) and N-RAS proto-oncogene GTPase (NRAS) mutational status detection and mRNA and miRNA profiling by qPCR. Genes were chosen for their functions in specific processes, such as immune response (CD2, PDL1, or CD274) and pigmentation (MITF, TYRP1, and TRPM1). Furthermore, four microRNAs, namely miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-204-5p, and miR-211-5p, were included in the profiling. Our results highlight differences in the gene expression profile of primary CM with respect to the geographical area and the altitude of residence. Melanoma-specific survival was influenced by the gene expression of mRNA and miRNAs and varied with the altitude of patients' residence. In detail, TYRP1 and miR-204-5p were highly expressed in patients living at higher altitudes, unlike miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-211-5p. Since miRNAs are highly regulated by reactive oxygen species, it is possible that different regulatory mechanisms characterize CMs at different altitudes due to the different environment and UVR intensity.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

513,1751,"Tailoring the radiotherapy approach in patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma based on inguinal sentinel lymph node biopsy Background and Objectives: The aim of our study was to analyze the results of selective inguinal node irradiation in patients with anal cancer, based on the biopsy of the inguinal sentinel lymph node (SLN), in terms of local control and prognosis. Method(s): Records of patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma from January 2001 to December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Tc99 lymphoscintigraphy was performed in all the clinically inguinal negative patients, followed by radio-guided surgical removal of the inguinal SLN. All patients were treated with combined radiochemotherapy. In patients with negative sentinel nodes, the inguinal area was excluded in the radiotherapy field. Result(s): A total of 123 patients, 76 females (61.8%), mean age 60.1 +/- 12.19 years old, underwent intraoperative lymph node retrieval. The histological analysis showed metastasis in the SLN in 28 patients (22.8%). The mean follow-up was 43.44 +/- 31.86 months. No inguinal recurrence was observed in patients with negative inguinal sentinel node(s). A statistically significant difference was observed for overall and disease-free survivals in a patient with positive and negative inguinal sentinel nodes. Conclusion(s): In patients with anal canal cancer, the exclusion of the inguinal regions from the radiotherapy field, in patients with negative SLN, does not compromise locoregional control nor prognosis.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",Excluded,0.17274569
514,1752,"Radiation-induced oesophagitis in lung cancer patients. Is susceptibility for neutropenia a risk factor? BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced oesophagitis is a major side effect of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A strong association between neutropenia and oesophagitis was previously shown, but external validation and further elucidation of the possible mechanisms are lacking., METHODS AND PATIENTS: A total of 119 patients were included at two institutions. The concurrent group comprised 34 SCLC patients treated with concurrent carboplatin and etoposide, and concurrent chest irradiation, and 36 NSCLC patients with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide, and concurrent radiotherapy, while the sequential group comprised 49 NSCLC patients received sequential cisplatin and gemcitabine, and radiotherapy., RESULTS: Severe neutropenia was very frequent during concurrent chemoradiation (grade: 4 41.4%) and during induction chemotherapy in sequentially treated patients (grade 4: 30.6%), but not during radiotherapy (only 4% grade 1). In the concurrent group, the odds ratios of grade 3 oesophagitis vs. neutropenia were the following: grade 2 vs. grade 0/1: 5.60 (95% CI 1.55-20.26), p = 0.009; grade 3 vs. grade 0/1: 10.40 (95% CI 3.19-33.95); p = 0.0001; grade 4 vs. grade 0/1: 12.60 (95% CI 4.36-36.43); p < 0.00001. There was no correlation between the occurrence of neutropenia during induction chemotherapy and acute oesophagitis during or after radiotherapy alone. In the univariate analysis, total radiation dose (p < 0.001), overall treatment time of radiotherapy (p < 0.001), mean oesophageal dose (p = 0.038) and neutropenia (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with the development of oesophagitis. In a multivariate analysis, only neutropenia remained significant (p = 0.023)., CONCLUSION: We confirm that neutropenia is independently correlated with oesophagitis in concurrent chemoradiation, but that the susceptibility for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is not associated with radiation-induced oesophagitis. Further studies focusing on the underlying mechanisms are thus warranted.",Excluded,0.19765906
516,1754,"MRI of small hepatocellular carcinoma: comparison with US, CT, DSA, and Lipiodol-CT Thirteen cirrhotic patients with 27 nodules of hepatocellular carcinoma less than 3 cm (small HCC) were examined with ultrasonography (US), MR, pre- and postcontrast CT, digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and CT after injection of Lipiodol (Lipiodol-CT). The accuracy of MR was compared with other diagnostic modalities and MR morphologic and the signal intensity features of HCC were investigated. The detection rate by MR was 63%, by US 67%, by CT 50%, by DSA 74%, and by Lipiodol-CT 93%. The Mc Nemar test showed no difference between the detection rates of MR and CT, MR and DSA, MR and US, and Lipiodol-CT and DSA; however, the differences between the detection rates of MR and Lipiodol-CT and CT and Lipiodol-CT were statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05). The difference in sensitivity between the detection rates of Lipiodol-CT and US was just above the level considered significant (P less than or equal to 0.065). On T1- and T2-weighted spin echo images 83% of small HCC were hyperintense relative to the surrounding liver parenchyma. Pseudocapsule was observed in 58% of lesions on T1-weighted images in particular. We believe that US is still the best diagnostic technique for the screening of HCC. We prefer MR to CT as a second level examination to support US in noninvasive diagnosis of small HCC, since MR gives the same or slightly better results than CT without the need of ionizing radiation and large amounts of iodized contrast medium. In our opinion, more invasive examinations, such as DSA and Lipiodol-CT, cannot be avoided in cases where an exact knowledge of the number of lesions is essential for the choice of therapy.",Excluded,0.1728994
517,1755,"""Beach Lifeguards' Sun Exposure and Sun Protection in Spain"" Background: Sunburn is the main avoidable cause of skin cancer. Beach lifeguards spend many hours exposed to the effects of solar radiation during their work day, precisely at times of the year when levels of solar irradiation are highest. The aim of this study is to quantify the risk to beach lifeguards of sun exposure. Method(s): A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in the Western Costa del Sol, southern Spain, during the summer of 2018. The research subjects were recruited during a skin cancer prevention course for beach lifeguards. All participants were invited to complete a questionnaire on their habits, attitudes, and knowledge related to sun exposure. In addition, ten were specially monitored using personal dosimeters for three consecutive days, and the results were recorded in a photoprotection diary. A descriptive analysis (mean and standard deviation for the quantitative variables) was performed, and inter-group differences were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test. Result(s): Two hundred fifteen lifeguards completed the questionnaire, and 109 met the criteria for inclusion in this analysis. The mean age was 23.8 years (SD: 5.1), 78.0% were male, 71.5% were phototype III or IV (Fitzpatrick's phototype), and 77.1% had experienced at least one painful sunburn during the previous summer. The mean daily personal ultraviolet exposure per day, the minimal erythema dose, and the standard erythema dose, in J/m2, were 634.7 [standard deviation (SD): 356.2], 2.5 (SD: 1.4) and 6.35 (SD: 3.6), respectively. Conclusion(s): Beach lifeguards receive very high doses of solar radiation during the work day and experience correspondingly high rates of sunburn. Intervention strategies to modify their sun exposure behavior and working environment are necessary to reduce the risk of skin cancer for these workers and to promote early diagnosis of the disease.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",Excluded,0.17459881
520,1758,"Hypofractionated volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for fragile patients with oesophageal cancer Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and dosimetric results of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to deliver hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) in oesophageal cancer patients, unfit for a multimodality curative strategy. Patients/methods: From 2010 to 2017, 22 patients were treated with hypofractionated VMAT for palliative/symptomatic setting. The prescription dose was 40 Gy in 16 fractions (EQD2 41.7 Gy considering an alpha/beta ratio of 10 Gy, and 44 Gy considering an alpha/beta ratio of 3 Gy). Result(s): Eight patients (36%) were symptomatic for grade 3 baseline dysphagia. RT was generally well tolerated, and no patient interrupted the daily treatment. Acute toxicity was generally mild; no G3 acute toxicities were reported. At the end of treatment, 5 patients (22.7%) experienced a stable dysphagia and 14 (63.6%) an improvement of baseline dysphagia, while 3 patients (13.7%) reported a worsening of oesophagitis. At a mean follow-up of 8.7 months, 15 patients (79%) had a complete clinical recovery (G0-1) of the symptomatic moderate/severe dysphagia. At 3 months after the end of RT, seven patients (31.8%) achieved a partial or complete response. Two coplanar arcs were employed for VMAT delivery. Dosimetric results were consistent in terms of both target coverage and normal tissue sparing. Finally, 1-year progression-free and overall survival was 20% and 27.3%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Hypofractionated VMAT was feasible, safe, and effective to deliver symptomatic radiation in locally advanced oesophageal cancer patients, non-suitable for a standard curative treatment.Copyright © 2020, Federacion de Sociedades Espanolas de Oncologia (FESEO).",Excluded,0.17090875

522,1760,"Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and short infusional 5-FU in advanced head and neck malignancies Background: Combination of radical surgery and radiotherapy is the standard management of head and neck malignancies. But due to considerable morbidity of surgery and associated cosmetic and functional deficiencies, often aggravated by adjuvant radiotherapy, many patients prefer only radiotherapy with its' decreased chance of survival. Proper surgical facilities are also not accessible to most of our patients. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and loco-regional management by surgery and / or radiotherapy have emerged as a viable alternative. Aim(s): The purpose of this study is to find out the survival outcome as well as toxicity profile of Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and short infusional (3 hours) 5-FU followed by radiotherapy in advanced head and neck malignancies. Material(s) and Method(s): From June 2002 to December 2003, seventy four patients with advanced head and neck malignancies were planned to be treated with Cisplatin (50 mg / sq. meter) on Days 1 and 2 and 5 - FU (600 mg / sq. meter) on Days 1, 2 and 3 by 3 hour infusion on Day care basis. On completion of four cycles of chemotherapy at 21 days interval, all patients were destined to receive 6000 cGy of radiotherapy to the loco - regional site. Result(s): At one year follow up on completion of therapy, 57% patients were alive and 31% patients were disease free. These 31% patients enjoyed a good quality of life in terms of cosmetic and functional deficits. Toxicities were moderate and easily manageable. Conclusion(s): The study indicated that neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with Cisplatin and short infusional 5 - FU may be delivered on day care basis and results are comparable with Cisplatin and 96 hours continuous infusional 5 - FU. Thus avoiding the continuous infusional 5 - FU, 7 to 10 days in-patient hospitalization during each cycle may be avoided which is a constrain in developing countries like us.",Excluded,0.17130803
523,1761,"Molecular and cellular profiling of acute responses to total body radiation exposure in ovariectomized female cynomolgus macaques Purpose: The threat of radiation exposure requires a mechanistic understanding of radiation-induced immune injury and recovery. The study objective was to evaluate responses to ionizing radiation in ovariectomized (surgically post-menopausal) female cynomolgus macaques. Material(s) and Method(s): Animals received a single total-body irradiation (TBI) exposure at doses of 0, 2 or 5 Gy with scheduled necropsies at 5 days, 8 weeks and 24 weeks post-exposure. Blood and lymphoid tissues were evaluated for morphologic, cellular, and molecular responses. Result(s): Irradiated animals developed symptoms of acute hematopoietic syndrome, and reductions in thymus weight, thymopoiesis, and bone marrow cellularity. Acute, transient increases in plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) were observed in 5 Gy animals along with dose-dependent alterations in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) signatures in thymus, spleen, and lymph node. Expression of T cell markers was lower in thymus and spleen, while expression of macrophage marker CD68 (cluster of differentiation 68) was relatively elevated in lymphoid tissues from irradiated animals. Conclusion(s): Ovariectomized female macaques exposed to moderate doses of radiation experienced increased morbidity, including acute, dose-dependent alterations in systemic and tissue-specific biomarkers, and increased macrophage/T cell ratios. The effects on mortality exceeded expectations based on previous studies in males, warranting further investigation.Copyright © 2015 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded,0.9624578
524,1762,"Quantification of Acute Skin Toxicities in Patients With Breast Cancer Undergoing Adjuvant Proton versus Photon Radiation Therapy: A Single Institutional Experience Purpose: Acute skin toxicity in the form of radiation dermatitis (RD) or skin hyperpigmentation (SH) is a common problem experienced by patients undergoing breast irradiation. Proton radiation has been thought to deliver higher doses to skin compared with photon radiation because of differences in the physical properties between photons and protons; however, limited literature exists directly comparing toxicity outcomes. Methods and Materials: The highest recorded grades of acute RD and SH were analyzed in 86 patients undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy to the breast with or without regional lymph nodes after lumpectomy (breast-conserving surgery) or mastectomy with either proton pencil-beam scanning (n = 39) or photon (n = 47) radiation therapy within a single institution to analyze differences in severity of acute skin reactions. For 34 of 47 photon and 33 of 39 proton patients, a ""skin"" contour was retroactively created in our treatment planning systems, and multiple dosimetric parameters were calculated to quantify objective radiation doses received by skin. Result(s): On chi2 analysis, the highest reported grade of RD was significantly higher in women undergoing proton radiation compared with photon radiation; grade >=2 RD was present in 69.2% versus 29.8% of patients receiving proton and photon therapy, respectively (P =.002). Rates of grade 3 RD were 5.1% versus 4.3% for proton versus photon radiation, respectively (P =.848). Overall, there were no significant differences in rates of SH between modalities. There were no grade 4 to 5 toxicities in either cohort. Conclusion(s): In a comparison with patients receiving photon radiation, a significantly higher rate of grade >=2 RD was observed in patients undergoing proton radiation, with very low rates of grade 3 toxicity in both groups. Rates of SH did not differ significantly between modalities. Women should be counseled regarding the possibility of increased grade 2 toxicities, although this might present a dosimetric advantage for physicians when treating patients in the postmastectomy setting or when skin was involved on presentation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.1788673
527,1765,"[Dental care in patients undergoing radiotherapy of the head and neck] Radiotherapy involving the oral cavity and salivary glands induces a wide range of alterations in oral tissues and salivary gland functions which may result in oral side effects. Some of these are inevitable and transient such as radiation mucositis, some however may be permanent such as xerostomia. Others however are preventable, and are caused by poor radiation techniques, application of excessive radiation doses or lack of necessary preventive measures. Frequent complications in these patients are development of caries, dental hypersensitivity, rapidly progressive periodontal disease and loss of taste. Occasionally, trismus and osteoradionecrosis may develop. Careful treatment planning before start of radiotherapy with adequate dosimetry and careful shielding of the healthy tissues as well as close monitoring of the oral cavity with strict application of preventive measures (dental care protocol) can significantly reduce the incidence of these complications.

535,1773,"Occurrence of Phosphenes in Patients Undergoing Proton Beam Therapy for Ocular Tumor Purpose: Phosphenes are frequently reported by patients irradiated in the head and neck area. The aim of the present study was to characterize and investigate potential mechanisms of proton beam therapy (PBT)-induced phosphenes in a large population of patients undergoing PBT for ocular tumors. Design(s): Prospective cohort study. Method(s): Consecutive patients who underwent PBT in a single center were included. Immediately after the first session, all patients completed a questionnaire collecting information about the presence of phosphenes as well as their color, shape, and duration. Patient, tumor and treatment characteristics (dose volume histograms) were also collected. Result(s): Among the 474 patients included, 62.8% reported phosphenes during the first session of PBT. Reported colors were mainly blue-violet (70.5%) and white (14.1%). The prevalence of phosphenes was higher in younger patients (P =.003); other patient or ocular characteristics were not associated with the occurrence of phosphenes. Irradiation of the macula (P <.001) and/or optic disc (P <.001) were significantly associated with the presence of phosphenes, whereas blue-violet color was only associated with young age and irradiation of macular area (P =.04). Pupillary constriction was reported for 57.1% of patients with phosphenes vs 18.5% of patients without (P <.001). Blue-violet phosphenes (P <.001) and irradiation of macula (P =.001) were statistically associated with pupillary constriction. Conclusion(s): The present study reported a high rate of phosphenes in patients irradiated by PBT for ocular tumor. Their blue-violet color and their association with a pupillary constriction probably indicates the stimulation of S-cones and retinal ganglion cells that reflects the activation of the afferent visual pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.1773496

Patients with oligometastatic CRC disease were analyzed retrospectively. The SRT prescribed dose was dependent on the lesion volume and its location. 102 consecutive oligometastatic CRC patients (150 lesions) were included. They underwent SRT between 2012 and 2015. Median prescription dose was 45 Gy (median dose/fraction was 15 Gy/3 fractions biological equivalent dose (BED10) 112.5 Gy). Median follow-up was 11.4 months. No patients experienced G3 and G4 toxicity. No progression was found in 82% (radiological response at 3 months) and 85% (best radiological response) out of 150 evaluable lesions. At 1 and 2 years: LC was 70% and 55%; OS was 90% and 90%; PFS was 37% and 27%; out-field PFS was 37% and 23% respectively. Progressive disease was correlated with BED10 (better LC when BED10 was >= 75 Gy (p < 0.0001)). In multivariate analysis, LC was higher in lesions with a Plpnning target volume (PTV) volume < 42 cm3 and BED10 >= 75 Gy. Patients with Karnofsky performance status < 90 showed higher out-field progression. SRT is an effective treatment for patients with oligometastases from CRC. Its low treatment-associated morbidity and acceptable LC make of SRT an option not only in selected cases. Further studies should be focused to clarify which patient subgroup will benefit most from this treatment modality and to define the optimal dose to improve LC while maintaining low toxicity profile.Copyright © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Excluded,0.17164667

542,1780,"Combining paratransgenesis with SIT: impact of ionizing radiation on the DNA copy number of Sodalis glossinidius in tsetse flies BACKGROUND: Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are the cyclical vectors of the causative agents of African Trypanosomosis, which has been identified as a neglected tropical disease in both humans and animals in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa. The sterile insect technique (SIT) has shown to be a powerful method to manage tsetse fly populations when used in the frame of an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) program. To date, the release of sterile males to manage tsetse fly populations has only been implemented in areas to reduce transmission of animal African Trypanosomosis (AAT). The implementation of the SIT in areas with Human African Trypanosomosis (HAT) would require additional measures to eliminate the potential risk associated with the release of sterile males that require blood meals to survive and hence, might contribute to disease transmission. Paratransgenesis offers the potential to develop tsetse flies that are refractory to trypanosome infection by modifying their associated bacteria (Sodalis glossinidius) here after referred to as Sodalis. Here we assessed the feasibility of combining the paratransgenesis approach with SIT by analyzing the impact of ionizing radiation on the copy number of Sodalis and the vectorial capacity of sterilized tsetse males., RESULTS: Adult Glossina morsitans morsitans that emerged from puparia irradiated on day 22 post larviposition did not show a significant decline in Sodalis copy number as compared with non-irradiated flies. Conversely, the Sodalis copy number was significantly reduced in adults that emerged from puparia irradiated on day 29 post larviposition and in adults irradiated on day 7 post emergence. Moreover, irradiating 22-day old puparia reduced the copy number of Wolbachia and Wigglesworthia in emerged adults as compared with non-irradiated controls, but the radiation treatment had no significant impact on the vectorial competence of the flies., CONCLUSION: Although the radiation treatment significantly reduced the copy number of some tsetse fly symbionts, the copy number of Sodalis recovered with time in flies irradiated as 22-day old puparia. This recovery offers the opportunity to combine a paratransgenesis approach - using modified Sodalis to produce males refractory to trypanosome infection - with the release of sterile males to minimize the risk of disease transmission, especially in HAT endemic areas. Moreover, irradiation did not increase the vector competence of the flies for trypanosomes.",Excluded,0.95948493
543,1781,"Eos, o-arm and standard spine radiographs; What is the cumulative radiation exposure during current scoliosis management? Background/introduction: During the course of assessment and treatment for AIS, patients are subjected to repeated radiological exposure. Only a few studies have evaluated the total absorbed radiation dose from standard radiography and EOS during follow-up for scoliosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate and compare total radiation dose exposure from all modalities for a cohort of AIS patients. Purpose of the study: The primary aim of this study was to determine the radiation exposure of AIS patients during scoliosis management. Moreover, this study aimed to compare follow-up algorithms among international spine centers. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective review on radiation exposure of patients treated for AIS. Inclusions: patients followed for AIS from 2013 to 2016 without neuromuscular diseases. The O-arm conebeam CT scanner was used for 3D navigation in all surgically managed patients, low dose protocols were used (70 kVp, 80 mAs). A survey asking for information on radiological algorithms and imaging frequencies was sent to a number of international spine centers for comparison with in-house algorithm. Result(s): 61 patients were included, 19 were treated conservatively (M/F: 6/13) and 42 surgically (M/F: 11/31). Median follow up time for the conservative group was 8 (range 0-51) months and 37 (range 13-163) months for the surgical group. Median number of X-rays/EOS were; 2 (range 0-20)/2 (range 0-17) for the conservative group and 15 (range 2-57)/11(range 0-26) for the surgery group. Patients undergoing surgery received a median cumulative radiation dose of 10.31 mSv (range 3.79-20.43) vs. a median dose of 1.09 mSv (range 0.22-7.17) for those treated conservatively. Approximately 25% (39.04/161.82 mSv) of total intraoperative radiation dose for all patients was a result of O-arm 2D fluoroscopy. A mean of 11 levels of the spine were fused during correction surgeries. Median Cobb angle at the beginning/end of follow up were 19-(range 10--50-)/23- (range 12--65-) for the conservative group and 44- (range 10--80-)/15- (range 4--30-) for the surgery group. Median Cobb angle before the surgery was 52- (range 36--82-). The results of the questionnaire showed great variety of radiological follow-up algorithms among 8 spine centers without adherence to any of the published consensus statements. Conclusion(s): Surgically treated patients were, as anticipated, exposed to more, radiation dose than those treated conservatively, almost 10-fold more, owing mainly to intraoperative 3D scans and a larger numbers of radiological follow-up examinations. The use of conebeam CT-based 3D navigation elevates patient safety during deformity surgery. However, patients are potentially exposed to a significant amount of radiation depending on protocol and use of 2D fluoroscopy. Further awareness of ways to reduce radiation dose and optimize radiological protocols is warranted in order to decrease radiation-induced malignancy.",Excluded,0.17128089
544,1782,"Effect of radiation dose reduction and iterative reconstruction on computer-aided detection of pulmonary nodules: Intra-individual comparison OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of radiation dose reduction and iterative reconstruction (IR) on the performance of computer-aided detection (CAD) for pulmonary nodules., METHODS: In this prospective study twenty-five patients were included who were scanned for pulmonary nodule follow-up. Image acquisition was performed at routine dose and three reduced dose levels in a single session by decreasing mAs-values with 45%, 60% and 75%. Tube voltage was fixed at 120 kVp for patients >= 80 kg and 100 kVp for patients < 80 kg. Data were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), iDose(4) (levels 1,4,6) and IMR (levels 1-3). All noncalcified solid pulmonary nodules >= 4 mm identified by two radiologists in consensus served as the reference standard. Subsequently, nodule volume was measured with CAD software and compared to the reference consensus. The numbers of true-positives, false-positives and missed pulmonary nodules were evaluated as well as the sensitivity., RESULTS: Median effective radiation dose was 2.2 mSv at routine dose and 1.2, 0.9 and 0.6 mSv at respectively 45%, 60% and 75% reduced dose. A total of 28 pulmonary nodules were included. With FBP at routine dose, 89% (25/28) of the nodules were correctly identified by CAD. This was similar at reduced dose levels with FBP, iDose(4) and IMR. CAD resulted in a median number of false-positives findings of 11 per scan with FBP at routine dose (93% of the CAD marks) increasing to 15 per scan with iDose(4) (95% of the CAD marks) and 26 per scan (96% of the CAD marks) with IMR at the lowest dose level., CONCLUSION: CAD can identify pulmonary nodules at submillisievert dose levels with FBP, hybrid and model-based IR. However, the number of false-positive findings increased using hybrid and especially model-based IR at submillisievert dose while dose reduction did not affect the number of false-positives with FBP.

Twenty cats underwent surgery to place a balloon for compression effect and 20 cats in a sham operation group received microsurgery without any treatment. The effects of gamma knife irradiation at 10-13 Gy on normal (sham operation group) and compressed (optic nerve compression group) optic nerves were investigated by pattern visual evoked potential examination and histopathology., RESULTS: Gamma knife radiosurgery at 10 Gy had almost no effect. At 11 Gy, P100 latency was significantly prolonged and P100 amplitude was significantly decreased in compressed optic nerves, but there was little change in the normal optic nerves. Doses of 11 Gy and higher induced significant electrophysiological variations and degeneration of the myelin sheath and axons in both normal and compressed optic nerves., CONCLUSIONS: Compressed optic nerves are more sensitive to gamma knife radiosurgery than normal optic nerves. The minimum dose of gamma knife radiosurgery that causes radiation injury in normal optic nerves is 12 Gy; however, the minimum dose is 11 Gy in compressed optic nerves. Copyright © 2013 S.

547,1785,"Factors influencing the degree of erythematous skin reactions in humans Dose-response relationships have been studied using an ordinal visual scale and reflectance spectrophotometry data from 123 treatment sites on 110 patients treated with 10 dose fractions over 12-14 days. Dose rates varied between 3 and 240 Gy/h and total doses of between 25 and 41 Gy were given using teletherapy apparatus. We found qualitative scoring of erythematous skin reactions to be subject to considerable inter- and intra-observer variation. Reflectance spectrophotometry provided more reproducible information, some of which was undetectable by naked eye. Baseline erythema readings were significantly higher in male patients and at anatomical sites of previous heavy UV exposure. In addition, a pronounced decline in erythema readings during the second week of therapy and 'reciprocal vicinity' (abscopal) effects adjacent to the field, undetected by the eye, were observed in a subset of patients. Meaningful dose-response relationships could be derived only from reflectance data with peak change from the pretreatment baseline measure providing the best discrimination. Peak erythema measures following treatment were found to depend on the age and gender of the patient as well as the treatment site and its baseline erythema measurement. This was independent of the total dose administered or the instantaneous dose rate at which it was delivered. The rate of erythema development was also dose rate dependent but only weakly dependent on the biological dose intensity (Gy equiv./day) of the treatment course. The data raise the question of whether irradiation-induced erythema is exclusively a secondary phenomenon occurring as a result of basal cell killing. The short repair half time value of 0.06 h obtained by direct analysis is perplexing and may reflect a dose rate-dependent physiological vasodilatory response to irradiation and/or a multi-component cellular repair process.",Excluded,0.18311122

550,1788,"Extracranial radiosurgery with volumetric modulated arc therapy: Feasibility evaluation of a phase I trial The aim of this study was to report early clinical experience in stereotactic body radiosurgery (SBRS) delivered using volumetric intensity modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in patients with primary or metastatic tumors in various extra-cranial body sites. Each enrolled subject was included in a different phase I study arm, depending on the tumor site and the disease stage (lung, liver, bone, metastatic), and sequentially assigned to a particular dose level. Technical feasibility and dosimetric results were investigated. The acute toxicity, tumor response and early local control were also studied. In total, 25 lesions in 20 consecutive patients (male/female, 11/9; median age, 67 years; age range, 47-86 years) were treated. Of these 25 lesions, 4 were primary or metastatic lung tumors, 6 were liver metastases, 8 were bone metastases and 7 were nodal metastases. The dose-volume constraints for organs at risk (OARs) were observed in 19 patients using a single-arc technique. Only in one patient were two arcs required. The treatment was performed without interruption or any other technical issues. The prescribed dose ranged from 12-26 Gy to the planning target volume (PTV). Delivery time ranged from 4 min to 9 min and 13 sec (median, 6 min and 6 sec). No incidence of grade 2-4 acute toxicity was recorded. The overall response rate was 48% (95% confidence interval (CI), 24.2-70.2) based on computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 89% (95% CI, 58.6-98.7) based on the positron emission tomography (PET) scan.

553,1791,"[Can angiography system with large-area flat digital panel induce higher irradiation in a patient during coronary angiography] BACKGROUND: Nowadays, angiography systems with flat digital panel are used in cardiology and invasive radiology as the detector of irradiation. The so called universal systems with a magnified panel are becoming more common. In this study we tried to find out whether in practice the increased surface area of detectors may increase the absorption dose in a patient., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 486 patients who underwent coronary angiography carried out by the same physicians. In 268 subjects the procedure was performed in cathlab A equipped with a cardiac angiography system, whereas in 218 subjects in cathlab B using universal angiography system. In the study the absorbed dose of irradiation by the patient was determined and its ratio to body mass, body mass index (BMI) and body surface area (BSA) was evaluated., RESULTS: The mean dose absorbed by the person under study did not differ between both catheterization laboratories. Similarly, there were no differences in the ratio of the absorbed dose and BMI. But the comparison of the ratio of the absorbed dose and the body mass showed significantly higher values in cathlab A, where. higher values of the ratio of the absorbed dose and BSA were also found (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: In the present study it was found that the use of universal angiography systems with a larger surface area of the detecting panel is not connected with the increase in the irradiation dose absorbed by the patent during coronary angiography as compared with classical cardiac angiography systems.",Excluded,0.17253816
555,1793,"National prevalence, trends and outcomes of takotsubo syndrome in hospitalizations with prior history of mediastinal/intrathoracic cancer and radiation therapy Background: Radiation therapy (RT) for cancers in thoracic/mediastinal region has been linked with heart damage following years of radiation exposure. However, prevalence of takotsubo syndrome (TTS) in patients with prior intrathoracic/mediastinal malignancies treated with RT has never been analyzed on a large scale. Method(s): We identified adult hospitalizations with prior mediastinal/intrathoracic cancer and RT and TTS using ICD-9 CM codes and the National Inpatient Sample (2007-2014) after excluding current admissions for chemotherapy. We then assessed the prevalence, odds, trends and in-hospital outcomes of TTS-related admissions in patients with vs. without prior intrathoracic cancer and RT. Result(s): We identified a total of 5,991,314 hospitalizations with prior intrathoracic/mediastinal malignancies and RT (~73 yrs., 85.2% female), of which 7663 (0.13%, 128 per 100,000) were diagnosed with TTS (~74 yrs., 95.8% females, 88.1% white). Higher odds and rising trends in TTS per 100,000 hospitalizations (from 31 to 241) were seen among patients with prior intrathoracic malignancies and RT as compared to those without (from 19 to 104) (ptrend < 0.001). All-cause in-hospital mortality (4.6% vs 2.8%; OR 1.45; 95%CI 1.29-1.63, p < 0.001), cardiogenic shock (4.3% vs 0.2%), cardiac arrest (3.1% vs 0.9%), arrhythmia (34.3% vs 24.6%), stroke (3.6% vs 2.8%), respiratory failure (14.5% vs 4.6%), and median length of stay and hospital charges were significantly higher in the TTS cohort. Conclusion(s): This study showed higher odds and increasing trends in TTS-related admissions with worse in-hospital outcomes among patients with prior intrathoracic/mediastinal cancer and RT, irrespective of the time interval from cancer diagnosis or RT to TTS occurrence.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.17522784
556,1794,"Anatomy versus physiology-guided ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation Background: Pulmonary vein isolation remains the cornerstone of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. However, due to high recurrence rates, especially in patients with persistent AF, PV antral isolation, complemented by linear ablation, autonomic modulation, and ablation of complex fractionated electrograms, have been attempted to increase the odds of success. However, the optimum approach for a complementary strategy in addition to PVI for persistent AF is unknown. Method(s): We performed a prospective randomized trial by assigning 92 patients with persistent AF in 1:1 ratio to pulmonary-vein isolation plus ablation of electrograms showing complex fractionated activity (45 patients), or pulmonary-vein isolation plus additional linear ablation across the left atrial roof and mitral valve isthmus (47 patients). The duration of follow-up was five years. The primary endpoint was freedom from any documented recurrence of atrial fibrillation after a single ablation procedure. Result(s): At a 12-month follow-up, 9 (23%) patients had AF recurrence in the linear ablation and 8 (21%) patients in the CFAE groups. At a mean follow-up duration of 59+/-36 months, 48.3% of patients in the linear ablation group and 44.6% of patients in the CFAE group were free from AF (p=0.403). There were no significant differences between the two groups for independent predictors of freedom from AF. The overall procedure time and radiation exposure were higher in the PVI+linear ablation group. There were five adverse events noted, two in the linear group (pericardial effusion not requiring drain) and 3 in the CFAE group (1 pseudoaneurysm, one effusion requiring pericardiocentesis and one effusion nor requiring drain). Conclusion(s): Among patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, we found no difference in maintenance of sinus rhythm in either linear ablation or ablation of complex fractionated electrograms was performed in addition to pulmonary vein isolation in short- and long-term follow-up.Copyright © 2020 CardioFront LLC.

560,1798,"Detection of point mutations at codon 12 of KI-ras in ophthalmic pterygia AIMS: Ophthalmic pterygium is a potentially vision-threatening lesion of unknown etiology, related to an exposure to solar light. Mutations to the ras genes are frequently observed in lesions related to an exposure to solar light. The present study aims at screening pterygia for mutations at codons 12 and 13 of the ras genes., METHODS: In all, 50 pterygia were examined, together with respective blood samples and specimens of normal conjunctiva. A PCR reaction was performed to amplify sequences containing codons 12 and 13 of Ki-ras, H-ras, and N-ras. An RFLP analysis was then performed to detect point mutations at codon 12. The mutational status at codons 12 and 13 was further explored with sequencing of PCR products., RESULTS: RFLP analysis revealed Ki-ras mutations at codon 12 in five (10%) of pterygia, whereas H-ras or N-ras mutations were not observed. Sequencing confirmed Ki-ras mutations at codon 12 and revealed absence of mutations at codon 13. The presence of Ki-ras mutations was significantly correlated with postoperative recurrence (P=0.02) and young age (P=0.04). Mutations were not observed in specimens of blood or normal conjunctiva for any of the genes examined., CONCLUSIONS: The absence of N-ras mutations is in agreement with previous reports concerning mucosal lesions. The detection of Ki-ras mutations and the association with postoperative recurrence implies a possible role of Ki-ras in the clinical profile of pterygium. The mechanism of Ki-ras mutations is unclear and could be independent of the action of UV light.",Excluded,0.18389763
563,1801,"Diagnosing fish bone and chicken bone impactions in the emergency department setting: Measuring the system utility of the plain film screen Objectives: In the emergency department, fish and chicken bone impactions are typically evaluated with screening x-rays. We sought to determine whether this modality ultimately improves system outcomes, including length of stay (LOS), cost, and radiation dosage. Method(s): We reviewed patients >=18 years old presenting to an urban academic emergency department over a 4-year period who received a screening soft-tissue x-ray to determine the presence of a retained fish or chicken bone. We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of x-ray and computed tomography (CT) evaluations, respectively, in addition to system outcomes. Result(s): Twenty-seven of the 78 patients included for analysis were ultimately positive for bone impaction. Initial x-ray interpretations demonstrated a sensitivity of 24.0% (95% CI, 9.4%-45.1%) and a specificity of 90.0% (95% CI, 78.2%-96.7%). However, initial CT interpretation (ie, a preliminary read from on-call residents) demonstrated a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI, 19.4%-99.4%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 59.0%-100%). LOS, cost, and radiation dosage were not significantly different between patients who ultimately had true bone impactions and those who did not (P > .05). Conclusion(s): X-rays are poor screening tools in determining fish or chicken bone impactions with poor diagnostic and system utility. Further studies should be performed to evaluate the role of a low-radiation CT screen.Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.",Excluded,0.17176835

Purpose of this study was to assess if patients undergone medial displacement calcaneal osteotomy with flexor digitorum longus transfer can practice sports. Method(s): 48 patients (21 men, 43. 75%; 27 women, 56. 25%), mean age at time of surgery of 42. 3 years (range 19-74 years), were reviewed with a medium follow-up of 30 months (range, 27-34 months). Pre-and post-operatively, each patient was evaluated clinically and by standard weight-bearing X-rays (antero-posterior, lateral and Saltzman 20degree views). Moreover, everyone's sporting activities and Sports Athlete Foot and Ankle Score (SAFAS) were collected. Result(s): Before surgery, 29 of 48 (60. 4%) patients practiced sports, spending an average of 1. 4h/week (range, 0-6h/week); after surgery, 40/48 (83. 3%) practiced sports with an average of 3. 5h/week (range, 0-15h/week).

572,1810,"Proton pump inhibitor use and risk of community-acquired Clostridium difficile-associated disease defined by prescription for oral vancomycin therapy BACKGROUND: The association between the use of proton pump inhibitors and the risk of Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) is controversial. In this study we re-examined a previously reported association between the use of proton pump inhibitors and the development of community-acquired CDAD, this time using an alternative case definition of the disease., METHODS: We performed a case-control study of community-acquired CDAD using a United Kingdom clinical research database. Patients receiving oral vancomycin therapy were identified as having CDAD, the only indication for this drug. Each case subject was matched with up to 10 control subjects. Neither the cases nor the controls had been admitted to hospital in the year before the date of the vancomycin prescription (index date). Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for key covariates., RESULTS: We identified 317 cases of community-acquired CDAD treated with oral vancomycin therapy and 3167 matched control subjects. Exposure to a proton pump inhibitor in the 90 days before the index date was associated with an increased risk of CDAD (odds ratio [OR] 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-5.2). Antibiotic exposure in the 90 days before the index date was also a significant risk factor for community-acquired CDAD (OR 8.2, 95% CI 6.1- 11.0), even though 45% of the case subjects had not received a prescription for an antibiotic during that period. Certain comorbidities, in particular renal failure, inflammatory bowel disease and malignant disease, as well as prior methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, were also associated with an increased risk., INTERPRETATION: Proton pump inhibitor use was associated with an increased risk of community-acquired CDAD, when cases were defined by receipt of prescription for oral vancomycin therapy. Prior antibiotic exposure was also a significant risk factor, but a significant proportion of the patients with community-acquired CDAD had no such exposure.",Excluded,0.18169132

Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of IMRT plans were used to determine radiation dose to thyroid and were compared with DVHs using conventional three-dimensional radiotherapy (3D-RT) in 10 of these same patients randomly selected for replanning and with DVHs of 16 patients in whom the thyroid was intentionally avoided during IMRT. Weekly paclitaxel (30 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin area under the curve-1 were given concurrently with IMRT., RESULTS: Sixty-one of 128 evaluable patients (47.7%) developed hypothyroidism after a median of 1.08 years after IMRT (range, 2.4 months to 3.9 years). Age and volume of irradiated thyroid were associated with hypothyroidism development after IMRT. Compared with 3D-RT, IMRT with no thyroid dose constraints resulted in significantly higher minimum, maximum, and median dose (p < 0.0001) and percentage thyroid volume receiving 10, 20, and 60 Gy (p < 0.05). Compared with 3D-RT, IMRT with thyroid dose constraints resulted in lower median dose and percentage thyroid volume receiving 30, 40, and 50 Gy (p < 0.005) but higher minimum and maximum dose (p < 0.005)., CONCLUSIONS: If not protected, IMRT for LAHNC can result in higher radiation to the thyroid than with conventional 3D-RT.

575,1813,"Phase 2 study of preoperative image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy to reduce wound and combined modality morbidities in lower extremity soft tissue sarcoma BACKGROUND: This study sought to determine if preoperative image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) can reduce morbidity, including wound complications, by minimizing dose to uninvolved tissues in adults with lower extremity soft tissue sarcoma. METHOD(S): The primary endpoint was the development of an acute wound complication (WC). IG-IMRT was used to conform volumes to avoid normal tissues (skin flaps for wound closure, bone, or other uninvolved soft tissues). From July 2005 to June 2009, 70 adults were enrolled; 59 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Median tumor size was 9.5 cm; 55 tumors (93%) were high-grade and 58 (98%) were deep to fascia. RESULT(S): Eighteen (30.5%) patients developed WCs. This was not statistically significantly different from the result of the National Cancer Institute of Canada SR2 trial (P =.2); however, primary closure technique was possible more often (55 of 59 patients [93.2%] versus 50 of 70 patients [71.4%]; P =.002), and secondary operations for WCs were somewhat reduced (6 of 18 patients [33%] versus 13 of 30 patients [43%]; P =.55). Moderate edema, skin, subcutaneous, and joint toxicity was present in 6 (11.1%), 1 (1.9%), 5 (9.3%), and 3 (5.6%) patients, respectively, but there were no bone fractures. Four local recurrences (6.8%, none near the flaps) occurred with median follow-up of 49 months. CONCLUSION(S): The 30.5% incidence of WCs was numerically lower than the 43% risk derived from the National Cancer Institute of Canada SR2 trial, but did not reach statistical significance. Preoperative IG-IMRT significantly diminished the need for tissue transfer. RT chronic morbidities and the need for subsequent secondary operations for WCs were lowered, although not significantly, whereas good limb function was maintained.

We report on outcome after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) in correlation with patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We analyzed 69 patients treated between 2000 and 2019. FSRT was delivered with a median total dose of 54 Gy (single fraction: 1.8 Gy). PRO questionnaires were sent to 28 patients. Median overall survival was 17.2 years; mean local control was 15.6 years (median not reached). Median follow-up was 5.8 years. Twenty (71%) patients participated in the PRO assessment. Physicians reported symptoms grade >=3 in 6 cases (9%). Of all, 35 (51%) patients suffered from hypopituitarism at baseline, and during follow-up, new or progressive hypopituitarism was observed in 11 cases (16%). Patients reported 10 cases of severe side effects. Most of these symptoms were already graded as CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) grade 2 by a physician in a previous follow-up exam. PROs are an essential measure and only correlate to a certain extent with the physician-reported outcomes. For high-precision radiotherapy of pituitary adenomas, they confirm excellent overall outcomes and low toxicity. In the future, the integration of PROs paired with high-end treatment will further improve outcomes.Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded,0.17994612

The dogs that were exposed once received alveolar depositions (+/- standard deviation) of 3.9 +/- 1.9 kBq/kg body mass and accumulated doses of 23 +/- 8 Gy to the lung before death at 5.4 +/- 1.7 years after exposure. Dogs exposed repeatedly received a total alveolar deposition of 5.3 +/- 0.9 kBq/kg body mass during 7 to 10 semiannual exposures and accumulated doses of 22 +/- 5 Gy to the lung before death at 4.9 +/- 0.7 years after first exposure. Clearance of the plutonium from the lung in the dogs exposed repeatedly was slower than in the dogs exposed once. All dogs in the repeated-exposure study and all but one dog in the single-exposure study died from radiation effects. Pulmonary fibrosis accounted for 72% of the radiation-related deaths in the single-exposure study and 87% in the repeated-exposure study. The remaining dogs died with pulmonary cancer. Based on total cumulative radiation dose, the times after exposure to death from radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis were not significantly different for single and repeated exposures. Thus dose rate does not appear to be an important factor in predicting death from radiation pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis for dogs inhaling 239PuO2.",Included,0.9484602

585,1823,"[Value of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group guidelines based on MR imaging in diagnosing lymph node metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma] BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and other major cooperative groups endorse the consensus guidelines for the delineation of the node levels in stage N0 cases. But it is unclear if these guidelines can be extrapolated to N+ cases. This study was to explore the value of RTOG guidelines in delineating cervical target volumes for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with lymph node metastasis., METHODS: Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the nasopharynx, including plain and contrast enhanced sequences, was performed on 254 naive NPC patients. The lymph nodes were divided into six cervical levels plus retropharyngeal nodes (RN) according to RTOG guidelines proposed in 2003., RESULTS: Anatomic boundaries of node levels were observed clearly on MRI. Of the 254 patients, 107 (42.1%) had obvious lymph node necrosis, 78 (30.7%) had extracapsular nodal spread, four (1.6%) had skipped metastasis. The levels of lymph node metastases in 51 (20.1%) patients were beyond RTOG guidelines, 42 of which were above cranial level IIb, six were behind the anterior edge of the trapezius muscle, and 23 were below the caudal of level IV; 20 patients had two regions of lymph node metastases beyond RTOG guidelines. No patient only with lymph node metastasis beyond RTOG guidelines was found., CONCLUSIONS: MRI is feasible to diagnose cervical node metastasis with RTOG guidelines. The boundaries of node levels should be enlarged rationally when delineating target volumes for the N+ NPC patients according to RTOG guidelines.",Excluded,0.1717362
586,1824,"Re-irradiation plus bevacizumab treatment in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab (BEV) is increasingly utilized in the treatment of recurrent high-grade gliomas. However, the utility of BEV in the setting of re-irradiation has not been fully evaluated. We examined the timing of BEV treatment in relation to re-irradiation for recurrent high-grade gliomas. METHOD(S): We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas, treated between2007 and 2012, with a second course of radiation therapy. We compared overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) as calculated from the time recurrent highgrade glioma was diagnosed. RESULT(S): A total of 50 patients were identified with a median follow-up of 10 months (range 2.2 to 70). 12 patients received no BEV, 18 received concurrent BEV with re-irradiation, 16 BEV after re-irradiation, and 4 before re-irradiation. Median PFS was 14.4, 3.6, 5.8, and 3.5 months and median OS 25.2, 6.3, 9.9, and 5.7 months, respectively. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or number of surgical resections between groups. However, patients not receiving BEV were more likely to have received either concurrent or adjuvant temozolomide with re-irradiation (p = 0.002, Fisher's Exact Test) or to have been first diagnosed with low-grade tumors. No patients that received BEV prior to re-irradiation experienced overt radiation necrosis, whereas other groups experienced a 30-33% incidence of necrosis. CONCLUSION(S): In this small retrospective study, patients receiving no BEV had superior survival. However, selection bias, temozolomide use and histologymayaccount for this finding. Amongpatients receiving BEV, BEV administered following re-irradiation yielded the best PFS and OS. However, BEV with re-irradiation did not appear to improve PFS or OS compared with historical data with single agent BEV or re-irradiation alone.BEVdid not appear to lower incidence of radiation necrosis, except when given prior re-irradiation.",Excluded,0.1793753

588,1826,"Inter- and Intraobserver Agreement in Measuring Urolithiasis Density on Nonenhanced Computed Tomography Introduction: Treatment choice for urolithiasis is partially based on measuring stone density in HU on nonenhanced computed tomography (NECT). Interobserver variability in these measurements could have treatment consequences. This study aims to assess the observer agreement of measuring HU and whether the use of a protocol leads to a better agreement. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively included 155 consecutive NECTs of patients with stones >=4 mm. Five observers (two radiologists, one urologist, one urology resident, and one radiology resident) assessed all anonymized NECTs four times in randomized order. HU was measured without instruction (rounds 1 and 2) and subsequently using two protocols (A and B, rounds 3 and 4). Protocols comprised using bone setting, zoom, and measuring HU without the penumbra, in either three (A) or one (B) axial plane. The inter- and intraobserver agreement was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Result(s): Interobserver agreement on HU measurement without protocol was as follows: ICC = 0.84 (confidence interval [CI]: 0.79-0.87). Agreement diminished with protocol A, ICC = 0.62 (CI: 0.37-0.76), and improved with protocol B, ICC = 0.90 (CI: 0.86-0.92). Intraobserver agreement without protocol was ICC = 0.87, with protocol A, ICC = 0.87, and with protocol B, ICC = 0.93. The biggest improvement was seen for urologists' agreement from no protocol to protocol B, where ICC improved from 0.81 (CI: 0.70-0.87) to 0.91 (CI: 0.84-0.94). Conclusion(s): Observer agreement of HU measurement of urolithiasis without protocol is already good but using zoom, bone setting, and measuring in a representative plane is recommended. This protocol results in higher agreement, especially among urologists. Measuring in three axial planes does not increase agreement.Copyright © 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.",Excluded,0.17189601
589,1827,"Phase I clinical trial with fractionated radioimmunotherapy using 131I-labeled chimeric G250 in metastatic renal cancer UNLABELLED: This trial was performed to determine the maximum tolerated whole-body radiation-absorbed dose of fractionated (131)I-cG250., METHODS: This was a phase 1 dose escalation trial. Dose escalation refers here to the escalation of average whole-body absorbed dose. Fifteen patients with measurable metastatic renal cancer were studied. For each treatment cycle, patients initially received a ""scout"" administration consisting of 5 mg of cG250 antibody labeled with 185 MBq (5 mCi) of (131)I. Whole-body and serum activity was measured for 1 wk, and a simple pharmacokinetic model was fitted to the measured data. The pharmacokinetic model was used to calculate the required activities, administered in a fractionated pattern with 2-3 d between fractions, projected to deliver the prescribed whole-body absorbed dose. The initial cohort of 3 patients was prescribed an average whole-body absorbed dose of 0.50 Gy. In subsequent cohorts this was increased in 0.25-Gy increments. The first fraction in each cycle was 1,110 MBq (30 mCi) of (131)I conjugated to 5 mg of antibody. Subsequent fractions consisted of variable activities depending on the patient-specific whole-body clearance rates and the times between fractions. Patients without evidence of disease progression were retreated after recovery from toxicity if there was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetics or serum human antichimeric antibody titers, for a total of no more than 3 treatments., RESULTS: For the initial treatment course, the pharmacokinetics of the scout dose accurately predicted the pharmacokinetics of fractionated (131)I-cG250 therapy. In 2 patients, altered clearance accurately predicted development of human antichimeric antibody. Targeting to known disease >or= 2 cm in diameter was noted in all patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was hematopoietic, and the maximum tolerated dose per cycle was 0.75 Gy., CONCLUSION: Measurements of whole-body and serum clearance of cG250 antibody can be used to accurately predict the clearance of subsequent administrations, thus enabling rational treatment planning. An additional practical benefit of real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring is that therapy can be altered dynamically to reduce toxic side effects. However, there was no evidence for fractionation-induced sparing of the hematopoietic system in this study.",Excluded,0.17117593
592,1830,"The possible benefit from total tumour resection in primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of central nervous system-a one-decade single-centre experience Background and methods. The aim of the study was to evaluate retrospectively clinical course of 27 patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) diagnosed and treated by different surgical approaches. Initial therapy-diagnostic approach included surgery with total tumour reduction (TTR) performed in 12 patients (44.4%), while partial reduction and biopsy were performed in 8 (29.7%) and 7 (25.9%) patients, respectively. All patients were treated with chemotherapy based on high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) with/without whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Results. The median overall survival (OS) and event-free survival were 37 and 31 months, respectively, with overall response rate of 74%. The patients who underwent an open surgery with TTR had significantly longer OS (median not reached), comparing with partial tumour reduction or biopsy only (Log-Rank chi2 6.08, p = 0.014) when median OS was 23 months. In patients with performance status according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG PS) >= 3, OS was 23 months, contrary to ECOG PS 1-2 when median was not reached. The International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group score (low, intermediate and high) also influenced OS between three risk groups (Log-Rank chi2 12.5, p = 0.002). Conclusion. The treatment of PCNSL still remains doubtful, however possible benefit from the TTR followed with HD-MTX with/without WBRT should be reconsidered.Copyright © 2015 The Neurosurgical Foundation.",Excluded,0.17186394
593,1831,"Gamma Knife radiosurgery for the treatment of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas Background: Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulae (DAVF) may present a treatment challenge. Endovascular embolization is in most cases the first line of treatment but does not always achieve cure. Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery represents an alternative treatment option, and the purpose of this study was to further evaluate its utility. Method(s): We reviewed all cases of DAVF treated between 2009 and 2016 at our institution with GK radiosurgery independently, or following failed/refused endovascular or surgical management. Patients' clinical files, radiological images, catheter angiograms, and surgical DAVF disconnection reports were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): Sixteen DAVF (14 patients) treated by GK radiosurgery were identified. Eleven fistulae were aggressive and five were benign. Marginal doses ranged from 15 to 25 Gy. Target volumes ranged from 0.04 to 4.47 cm3. In all symptomatic patients, GK treatment resulted in symptom palliation. In 13/15 lesions, cure of symptoms (86.0%) was reported. One lesion was asymptomatic. Angiographic cure was achieved in eight cases (50%), small residual DAVF occurred in four, and four were unchanged. One patient developed headache that resolved at one year. No hemorrhage occurred during the follow-up period. There was no significant association between Borden type and cure rate. Prior failed endovascular treatment and small target volume were associated with lower rates of cure. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery is viable treatment for DAVF. It is very effective in palliating symptoms as a de novo approach or adjunctive to endovascular therapy. In our experience it is only somewhat effective in achieving complete angiographic cure.Copyright © The Author(s) 2016.",Excluded,0.17194451
595,1833,"Association of pretreatment serum albumin with reduction in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma tumor volume during curative external beam radiation therapy Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have been shown to lose more weight compared to patients with tumors at other sub-sites during external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Furthermore, severe malnutrition before EBRT initiation may affect treatment outcome. This study investigated the association of factors, including nutritional status before treatment initiation, with gross tumor volume shrinkage rates (GTVSRs) during EBRT in OSCC patients. Materials/Methods: This retrospective study included 65 consecutive OSCC patients [55 males, 10 females, median age 65 years (38e82)] with no prior OSCC surgery. They were treated with definitive EBRT between November 2006 and December 2014. Tumors were staged as T1 (n = 7, 11%), T2 (n = 21, 32%), T3 (n = 18, 28%), T4a (n = 15, 23%), or T4b (n=4, 6%); N0 (n=9, 14%), N1 (n=3, 5%), N2a (n=3, 5%), N2b (n Z 26, 40%), N2c (n = 18, 27%), or N3 (n = 6, 9%); and as M0 (n = 64, 98%) or M1 (n = 1, 2%). Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was performed in 48 patients (74%) before EBRT initiation. Total radiation doses were as follows: 70 Gy, n = 62 (94%) and 71, 66, and 64 Gy, n = 1 each (2%). Computed tomography (CT) images were acquired prior to EBRT initiation and at 3e5 weeks after EBRT initiation for re-planning. Cervical body volume (CBV) was evaluated before EBRT initiation using initial CT images. GTVSRs were calculated based on initial and re-planning CT images. Four patients (6%) received induction chemotherapy (IC). Fifty-seven patients (88%) received concurrent chemotherapy (CC) using following regimen: TPF [docetaxel (DTX), cisplatin (CDDP), and 5-fluorouracil] (n = 29, 44%); another CDDP-based menu (n = 22, 34%); the other DTX-based menu (n = 3, 5%); and cetuximab (n = 3, 5%). Univariate analyses (UA) and multivariate analyses (MA) were performed to identify baseline factors related to the GTVSR. Potential variables include age, gender, T and N stage, use of IC, use of CC, CC menu, use of PEG, serum albumin (Alb), Alb globulin ratio (AGR), C-reactive protein (CRP), CBV, body weight (BW), and body mass index (BMI) before treatment initiation. Variables with UAvalues of P < 0.10 were included in MAs. Result(s): The median GTVSR was 51.1% (range, -9.8e86.8%). The median pretreatment Alb, AGR, CRP, CBV, BWand BMI were as follows: 3.7 g/dl (range, 2.5e4.7 g/dl), 1.2 (range, 0.5e1.7), 0.5 mg/dl (range, 0.1e10.4 mg/dl), 1552.3 cc (range, 962.8e2229.5 cc), 58.3 kg (range, 35.0e80.9 kg), and 20.7 kg/m2 (range, 12.9e28.8 kg/m2). In UAs, N0 stage (P = 0.032), N1>= stage (P = 0.036), Alb (P = 0.006), CBV (P = 0.007), and BW (PZ0.041) were significant. N2a>= stage (PZ0.05), use of PEG (PZ 0.052), DTX-based menu (P = 0.058), and BMI (P =0.05) were marginally significant. MAs revealed an association of higher pretreatment Alb with GTVSR (P = 0.02; 95% confidence interval, 2.94e32.47). Conclusion(s): Higher pretreatment Alb was associated with greater GTVSR during curative EBRT.

601,1839,"Use of unstable chromosome aberrations for biological dosimetry after the first postirradiation mitosis The loss of unstable chromosome aberrations after the first postirradiation mitosis makes their use difficult in radiation dosimetry. We describe here a method which, in a cell population observed at this stage, allows retrospective estimation of the frequencies of the unstable aberrations induced at the time of irradiation, and their use as a dosimeter. The laws controlling the behavior of unstable aberrations during mitosis were defined from a large-scale experiment on irradiated human lymphocytes. For cells undergoing the first, second, or third mitosis after irradiation, relationships were determined between the frequency, at irradiation time, of acentric fragments not arising from formation of dicentrics or rings, and the ratio of dicentrics and centric rings appearing without acentric fragments to the total number of dicentrics plus rings. On the basis of this ratio, the method described here provides an assessment of the postirradiation mitotic activity in a cell population. This assessment permitted estimation of the cell distribution and frequency of dicentrics plus centric rings, and of the frequency of acentric fragments at the time of irradiation. The use of this method for retrospective dosimetry after whole-body irradiation under various conditions of exposure is illustrated.",Excluded,0.8692558

Background(s): Rate of progression of XRT-associated moderate AS and its impact on outcomes is not well-described. Method(s): We included 81 patients (age 61 +/- 13 years; 57% female) with at least XRT-associated moderate AS (aortic valve area [AVA] 1.05 +/- 0.3 cm2; mean gradient 24 +/- 10 mm Hg) who had >=2 transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) 1 year apart and matched them in a 1:2 fashion on the basis of age, sex, and AVA with those without prior XRT. Serial aortic valve gradients and AVA were recorded. AVR and longer-term all-cause mortality during follow-up were recorded. Result(s): A total of 100% of patients had 1, a total of 71% had 2, and 39% had 3 follow-up TTEs. Before AVR, mean AVG and AVA were not significantly different between XRT and comparison groups. At 3.6 +/- 2.0 years from baseline TTE, 146 (60%) underwent AVR (16% transcatheter), with significantly more patients in the XRT group undergoing AVR (80% vs. 50%; p < 0.01), at a much shorter time (2.9 +/- 1.6 years vs. 4.1 +/- 2.4 years; p < 0.01). At 6.6 +/- 4.0 years from the initial TTE, 49 (20%) patients died, with a significantly higher mortality in the XRT group (40% vs. 11%; p < 0.01), with prior XRT associated with increased longer-term mortality, whereas AVR was associated with improved longer-term survival. Conclusion(s): In patients with moderate AS, those with prior XRT have a similar rate of progression of AS versus a comparison group. A higher proportion of patients in the XRT group were referred for AVR at a shorter time from baseline TTE. Despite that, the XRT patients had significantly higher longer-term mortality, and prior exposure to XRT was associated with significantly increased longer-term mortality.Copyright © 2018 American College of Cardiology Foundation",Excluded,0.4819874

The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of cancer in NM technologists in relation to work history, procedures performed and radioprotection practices. Methods From the US Radiologic Technologists cohort study, 72 755 radiologic technologists who completed a 2003-2005 questionnaire were followed for cancer mortality through 31 December 2012 and for cancer incidence through completion of a questionnaire in 2012-2013. Multivariable-adjusted models were used to estimate HRs for total cancer incidence and mortality by history of ever performing NM procedures and frequency of performing specific diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and associated radiation protection measures by decade. Results During follow-up (mean=7.5 years), 960 incident cancers and 425 cancer deaths were reported among the 22 360 technologists who worked with NM procedures. We observed no increased risk of cancer incidence (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04) or death (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.19) among workers who ever performed NM procedures. HRs for cancer incidence but not mortality were higher for technologists who began performing therapeutic procedures in 1960 and later compared with the 1950s. Frequency of performing diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and use of radioprotection measures were not consistently associated with cancer risk. No clear associations were observed for specific cancers, but results were based on small numbers. Conclusion Cancer incidence and mortality were not associated with NM work history practices, including greater frequency of procedures performed.Copyright © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of atypical manifestations in patients with acid reflux disease and the effect of PPI treatment. Patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of reflux were enrolled. Erosive esophagitis was stratified using the Los Angeles classification. Demographic data and symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire and included typical symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, odynophagia), and atypical symptoms (e.g., chest pain, sialorrhea, hoarseness, globus sensation, chronic coughing, episodic bronchospasm, hiccup, eructations, laryngitis, and pharyngitis). Symptoms were reassessed after a 3-month course of b.i.d. PPI therapy. A total of 266 patients with a first diagnosis of GERD (erosive, 166; non-erosive, 100) were entered in the study. Presentation with atypical symptoms was approximately equal in those with erosive GERD and with non-erosive GERD, 72% vs 79% (P = 0.18). None of the study variables showed a significant association with the body mass index. PPI therapy resulted in complete symptom resolution in 69% (162/237) of the participants, 12% (28) had improved symptoms, and 20% (47) had minimal or no improvement.

To improve outcome without significant increase in acute and late morbidity, we began a moderately accelerated hyperfractionation radiation therapy protocol without breaks for treatment of unresectable/advanced head and neck malignancies. From August 1984 to June 1995, 48 patients with unresectable or advanced carcinoma of the head and neck were treated using a protocol of accelerated hyperfractionation radiation therapy at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Los Angeles. Patients were treated twice a day using 150 cGy per fraction, 4 days per week, to a final dose of 60 Gy. Two patients were excluded from this analysis because they did not complete treatment. With a median follow-up of 33 months, 31 (67%) patients have had disease recurrence, 30 (65%) of whom had a locoregional component to their failures. At the last follow-up, 12 patients (26%) were alive with no evidence of disease, 30 patients had died of disease, and 4 had died of intercurrent disease without recurrence. Nine (19%) patients required treatment interruptions averaging 8 days in duration. This accelerated regimen resulted in outcomes similar to those with conventional radiotherapy, most likely because of a conservative total dose.

Methods For a cohort of 26 846 aircrew personnel, standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated. Dose-response analyses were carried out using Poisson regression to assess dose-related cancer risks for the period 1960-2014. Exposure assessment comprises recently available dose register data for all cohort members and newly estimated retrospective cabin crew doses for 1960-2003. Results SMR for all-cause, specific cancer groups and most individual cancers were reduced in all aircrew groups. The only increases were seen for brain cancer in pilots (n=23, SMR 2.01, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.28) and for malignant melanoma (n=10, SMR 1.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.85). Breast cancer mortality among female cabin crew was similar to the general population (n=71, SMR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.44). Overall median cumulative effective dose was 34.2 mSv (max: 116 mSv) for 1960-2014. No dose-response associations were seen in any of the models. For brain cancer, relative risks were elevated across dose categories. An indicative negative trend with increasing dose category was seen for large intestine cancer in female cabin crew (n=23). Conclusions There was no evidence for significant dose-response patterns for the considered cancer types. Interpretation of results remains difficult as cumulative dose is closely related to age. Future work should focus on investigating radiation jointly with other risk factors that may contribute to risks for specific cancers among aircrew.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

621,1859,"Lifelong hematopoiesis in both reconstituted and sublethally irradiated mice is provided by multiple sequentially recruited stem cells Objective. To evaluate the dynamics of stem cell production to hematopoiesis, the number of active stem cell clones and the lifespan of individual clones were studied. Materials and Methods. The clonal contribution of primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) responsible for long-term hematopoiesis was determined using two approaches. In one model, irradiated female mice were reconstituted with retrovirally marked male hematopoietic cells. In the second model, mice were irradiated sublethally without hematopoietic cell transplantation. In both models, bone marrow cells were serially sampled from the same mouse throughout a 12- to 20-month period and injected into irradiated recipients for analysis of day 10 colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S). The donor origin of CFU-S was determined by the presence of retrovirally marked cells or cells with chromosomal aberrations. Results. The results of the two essentially different models show that 1) hematopoiesis is mainly the product of small clones of hematopoietic cells; 2) the lifespan of the majority of clones is only 1 to 2 months; 3) the clones usually function locally; and 4) the vast majority of the clones replace one another sequentially. Primitive HSCs capable of producing long-lived clones (about 10% among all clones), which exist during the entire life of a mouse, were detected by the radiation-marker technique only. Conclusion. Multiple short-living clones (at least on the level of CFU-S production) comprise the vast majority of the active stem cells in transplanted recipients or after endogenous recovery from sublethal irradiation. © 2001 International Society for Experimental Hematology.",Excluded,0.86978936

The occurrence of IPE in young immunosuppressed C58 mice was systematically analyzed. When mice less than 2 weeks old were x-irradiated with 600 R, IPE could not be induced. The incidence in 1-month-old mice was approximately 50% and increased progressively with the age except for a drop in incidence at 3 months. An analysis of the dose effects of x-irradiation on the occurrence of IPE in mice of different ages revealed a marked increase in the incidence in 3- and 5-month-old mice beginning at dose levels of 450 R and 300 R, respectively. Considered together, these data indicated that two subpopulations of immunocytes differing in x-ray sensitivity interacted to protect mice from IPE. It appears that under natural conditions an x-ray sensitive cell population, possibly having suppressor function, decreased with age and made mice susceptible ot induction of IPE. Five-month-old mice were immunosuppressed with an LD10 of cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, or methotrexate to determine whether mice immunosuppressed with drugs also were susceptible to the induction of IPE. The incidence was 89%, 13%, and 5%, respectively. The mouse strain specificity of IPE induction also was studied. In 6- to 8-month-old mice suppressed with 600 R, IPE could not be induced in non-H-2k strains: BALB, C57BL/6, NZB. Of the H-2K strains tested (CBA/J, C3H/He, AKR/J, C58), the disease could be induced only in the C58 and AKR/J strains. Histopathologic studies showed that CNS lesions in immunosuppressed C58 and AKR/J mice did not differ significantly from those in old C58 mice with IPE. Taken together, the results of these studies indicate that IPE can be used as a model for analyzing age-dependent diseases of suspected immunopathologic etiology.",Excluded,0.9578811
629,1867,"Long-haul flights, edema, and thrombotic events: Prevention with stockings and Pycnogenol supplementation (LONFLIT Registry Study) BACKGROUND: This registry study evaluated the effects of Pycnogenol on edema and thrombotic complications in long-haul flights; jet lag was also evaluated. METHOD(S): Four hundred and fifty subjects at different risk levels for thrombosis, flying in economy class twice in less than a week for more than 8 hours, were included; 295 completed the registry study and were subdivided in 3 groups according to their risk level - low, moderate, or high. The high-risk group also received Aspirin. Astandard management (SM) was used in all groups. In each risk category, three groups were made according to patient management: A Pycnogenol group, a SM group (control), and a stockings group. The groups were comparable at inclusion. No side effects were observed. RESULT(S): In the low risk group edema were reduced more (P<0.05) with Pycnogenol and stockings compared to control. Ankle circumference was smaller with Pycnogenol (P<0.05). No thrombosis was detected. D-dimer was negative in Pycnogenol subjects; one subject in the control group had increased values, as did two of the 36 subjects in the stockings group. In the group with moderate risk, edema and ankle circumference were lower in the Pycnogenol group (P<0.05). One deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and one minimal superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) was seen in controls. D-dimer was normal in the Pycnogenol group. In high-risk subjects, edema, and ankle circumference were significantly reduced in the Pycnogenol group (P<0.05). There were no SVT or DVT in the Pycnogenol group. One minimal DVT and one SVT were observed in controls. D-dimer was negative in all Pycnogenol subjects (P<0.05); three post-flight values increased in controls and in four of the 32 subjects in the stockings group. The jet lag score was lower in low-, medium-, and high-risk Pycnogenol subjects (P<0.05). CONCLUSION(S): This registry study indicates that Pycnogenol supplementation reduces edema and may control some thrombotic events.Copyright © 2017 Edizioni Minerva Medica.",Excluded,0.18103357

Design(s): Prospective, multicenter, interventional, noncontrolled clinical trial. Participant(s): Fifty-three eyes of 53 participants with neovascular AMD requiring frequent anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) retreatment. Method(s): Participants underwent pars plana vitrectomy with a single 24-Gy dose of EMB delivered using an intraocular, handheld cannula containing a strontium 90/yttrium 90 source positioned over the active lesion. Participants were retreated with ranibizumab administered monthly as needed, using predefined retreatment criteria. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was undertaken monthly, with images assessed by an independent reading center. Main Outcome Measure(s): Coprimary outcomes at 12 months were proportion of participants with stable vision (losing <15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] letters) and mean number of anti-VEGF retreatments. Result(s): Before enrollment, participants had received an average of 12.5 anti-VEGF injections. After a single treatment with EMB, 81% maintained stable vision, with a mean of 3.49 anti-VEGF retreatments in 12 months. Mean +/- standard deviation change in visual acuity was -4.0+/-15.1 ETDRS letters. Mean +/- standard deviation OCT central retinal thickness increased by 50+/-179 mum. Common adverse events included conjunctival hemorrhage (n = 38), cataract (n = 16), resolving vitreous hemorrhage (n = 6), and eye pain (n = 5). Conclusion(s): Epimacular brachytherapy produces stable visual acuity in most participants with previously treated, active disease.

632,1870,"The treatment of movement disorders using gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery GK radiosurgical thalamotomy is an effective and useful alternative to invasive radiofrequency techniques for patients at high surgical risk. The mechanical accuracy of the gamma unit combined with the anatomical accuracy of high-resolution MR imaging makes radiosurgical lesioning safe and precise. Higher radiosurgical doses are more effective than lower ones at eliminating or reducing tremor and are without complications. The results from radiosurgical pallidotomy have been disappointing compared to those of gamma thalamotomy. A 50% complication rate in the former (homonymous field cuts, hemipareses, and dysphagias) combined with a poor success rate has led us to re-evaluate the indications for this procedure in the face of the excellent results obtained from radiofrequency pallidotomy with physiological monitoring. Perhaps lowered radiosurgical prescription doses can improve the complication rate. Anatomically, there appears to be a different sensitivity of the pallidum to radiation than that of the thalamus. Age-related or anatomy-related susceptible blood supply to the area may lead to hypoxia after single-fraction radiosurgery in a nuclear complex known to be especially susceptible to hypoxia. In addition, varying levels of iron deposition within the pallidum may catalyze free radical formation in the elderly only to be further exacerbated by tissue hypoxia. Future experience with radiosurgical treatment of essential tremor, dystonias, and other movement disorders should parallel that of radiofrequency techniques.",Excluded,0.30681172
633,1871,"Pathologic response prediction and neoadjuvant rectal score evaluation in patients with rectal cancer Aim: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the factors of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) affecting the pathologic response in locally advanced rectal cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 80 rectal cancer patients undergoing nCRT were included in the study to investigate clinical and pathological factors associated with tumor regression grade. Neoadjuvant rectal scoring (NAR) was calculated to predict overall survival. Result(s): Thirteen patients (16%) were detected to have pathologic complete response (pCR) and 24 patients (30%) as pathologic poor response (pPR). Tumor size in pCR group was smaller than the in other groups (p=0.003). Distal tumor localization and clinical complete response (cCR) were associated with pCR (p=0.007, p<0.005 respectively). Higher rates of pPR were observed in patients with residual tumours (cPR) (p=0.007). The factors correlated to low NAR were distal tumor localization, pathologically negative lymph nodes, cCR, and pCR (p=0.003, p=0.017, p<0.005, p<0.005 respectively). Statistically significant correlations were identified between high NAR and PET-CT stage III disease (p=0.03), pathologic lymph node metastasis (p<0.005) and cPR (p=0.007). Discussion(s): Clinical and pathologic factors are correlated with tumour regression grade and 5-year overall survival expectancy.

The volumes of the optic nerve receiving doses of more than 7.5 or 12 Gy, respectively, were defined. Optic nerve circumference included in the 30%, 40%, 50%, or 80% isodose (ON%) and retina included in 30% or 40% were determined as quantal effects. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for clinical variables as well as probit analysis to define EDx (doses where a positive response is expected in x% of the cases)., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 90.0 (interquartile range 69.0-98.0) months. Fifty-two (71%) and 49 (67%) patients developed radiation retinopathy and optic neuropathy (any grade). Age, length of follow-up and diabetes were significant parameters regarding retinopathy. Optic neuropathy was significantly influenced by age, length of follow-up, and ON30. The probability of optic neuropathy (any grade and grade >= 2) significantly increases with the dose (p ranges from 0.0126 to 0.0211)., CONCLUSION: Treatment planning should aim at minimizing encompassing isodoses particularly in the low dose region, without compromising PTV coverage.

Salisbury Eye Evaluation Project Team We have developed an empirical model with which to estimate the ocular exposure in the UVB wavelength band. This model incorporates aspects of personal behavior, geographic location, season and wavelength that have been developed from population-based data. This model, in conjunction with job history interviews, allows the estimate of cumulative exposures from age 30 in our population-based study. We present data on average annual exposure by age, gender, race, education and reported photophobia. The exposures in the general population are considerably lower than exposures reported in previous works based on occupational groups. There is a statistically significant difference between males and females, with females having lower exposures. African-Americans have median exposures similar to whites. Exposures decrease with education and with reported photophobia. These data provide the basis for characterizing lifetime exposure for the general population. The variability of exposure is much greater than found in occupational groups and includes numbers in the lowest exposure. The model should permit determination of a dose-response relationship with eye disease, even to the lower dose ranges.",Excluded,0.17965558
638,1876,"Significant Correlation Between Overall Survival and Mean Lung Dose in Lung Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) Background: After stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for medically inoperable stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), more patients die of comorbidities, particularly severe pulmonary insufficiency, than of tumor progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate correlation between lung biologically effective dose (BED) with an alpha/beta ratio of 3 Gy (BED3) and overall survival (OS) for these patients. Method(s): From 2012 to 2017, we have developed a prospectively updated institutional database for all first 100 consecutively treated patients with inoperable Stage 1 (T1T2N0M0) NSCLC. All SBRT were conducted on a Novalis Tx LINAC with two coplanar dynamic conformal arcs (84%) or with coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) (16%). Mean GTV and PTV were 8.6 cc and 50.8 cc, respectively. The marginal dose prescribed to the PTV was the 80% isodose line (IDL), i.e., 54 Gy in 3 fractions for 76 patients (BED10 = 126 Gy) and 50 Gy in 5 fractions for 24 patients (BED10 = 83.3 Gy). Pulmonary heterogeneity has been taken into account by using Monte Carlo or AAA algorithms. Median follow-up was 25 months. Result(s): At 1, 2, 3 and 5 years, local control (LC) was respectively 100, 98.2, 98.2, and 77.7%, and OS was respectively 83, 71.2, 58.1, and 33.2% (median OS was 49 months). Significant OS prognostic factors in univariate and multivariate analysis were mean lung BED3 (HR = 1.14, p = 0.01) and PTV volume (HR = 1.01, p = 0.004). A mean lung BED3 <= 5 Gy was significantly associated with a doubling of median OS from 29 months to more than 60 months (not achieved, p = 0.0068). For patients with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <= 40%, a mean lung BED3 <= 4 Gy was significantly associated with a doubling of median OS from 23 to 46 months (p = 0.019). Conclusion(s): Mean lung BED3 is strongly and significantly associated with OS in SBRT for inoperable Stage I NSCLC. For all treated patients, a mean lung BED3 <= 5 Gy lead to a doubling of median OS. This threshold value should be reduced to 4 Gy for patients with FEV1 <= 40%.© Copyright © 2020 Dupic, Biau, Molnar, Chassin, Dedieu, Lapeyre and Belliere-Calandry.",Excluded,0.17105111
639,1877,"Prevalence and expectations of ""alternative and complementary medicine"" use during radiotherapy in 2016: A prospective study Purpose: Alternative and complementary medicine is defined as any substance or technique of non-allopathic medicine used to improve health and quality of life. The purpose of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the use of alternative and complementary medicine during radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): A questionnaire was given the last week of treatment to all patients treated for breast cancer, prostate cancer or head and neck cancer in our centre in 2016. Result(s): In 2016, 132 patients were included. Fifty-seven patients (43%) used alternative and complementary medicine during radiotherapy, more women (61%) than men (35%) (P = 0.005). The use of alternative and complementary medicine varied according to locations: 44% of head and neck cancers, 57% of breast cancers and 24% of prostate cancers, but sex was the confounding factor. If alternative and complementary medicine was used before radiotherapy, 82% of patients used it during treatment, compared to 30% if they were naive (P < 10-7). Healing touch (68%), homeopathy (26%) and magnetisers (21%) were the most used alternative and complementary medicines. Sixty-one percent of patients used alternative and complementary medicine to reduce skin and mucosal side effects of treatments, 28% to improve well-being, and 9% to treat cancer. Seventy-two percent of all patients would advise their loved one to use an alternative and complementary medicine and 87% would like information about them in the hospital. Conclusion(s): Alternative and complementary medicines are used more by women, and by patients who used them before radiotherapy. The desired effects are mainly to reduce the side effects of the treatments. More than 80% of patients, whether or not they use alternative and complementary medicine, demand medical information.Copyright © 2018",Excluded,0.17908764

645,1883,"Radioprotective effect of the Barbados Cherry (Malpighia glabra L.) against radiopharmaceutical Iodine-131 in Wistar rats in vivo Background: The increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables has contributed to the improvement of populational health, due in part, to the abundance of antioxidants in these foods. Antioxidants reduce the level of oxidative damage to DNA caused by free radicals and ionizing radiation, including the radioisotope iodine-131 (131I). This isotope is used for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid injuries, such as hyperthyroidism and cancer. Method(s): This study aimed to evaluate the radioprotective and cytotoxic activity of acute and subchronic treatments with Barbados Cherry (BC) (Malpighia glabra L.) fruit juice (5 mg), which is rich in potent antioxidants such as vitamin C, phenols, carotenoids, anthocyanins and yellow flavonoids and its activity against the mutagenic activity of the therapeutic dose of 25 muCi of radioiodine for hyperthyroidism. The test system used was the bone marrow cells of Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) that were treated in vivo by gavage. Result(s): BC showed radioprotective activity in acute treatments, which is most likely due to the joint action of its antioxidant components. In subchronic treatments, the continuous treatment presented an effective radioprotective activity, which was significantly different from treatment with the radiopharmaceutical only. Treatment with BC prior to (PRE) and simultaneous with (SIM) ionizing radiation decreased the number of induced chromosomal alterations, while post-treatment produced no protective effect. In addition, BC exhibited no cytotoxic activity. Conclusion(s): These data serve as evidence that BC can be used as a preventive health measure to improve public health quality by countering the action of inevitable exposure to mutagens, such as 131I. © 2014 Dusman et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded,0.9325298

647,1885,"A hypothetical protocol for the provisional use of perfusion imaging with exercise stress testing Background: Previous literature suggests that the results of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) add little to the prognosis of patients who exercise >10 metabolic equivalents (METS) during stress testing. With this in mind, we attempted to determine if a provisional injection protocol could be developed in which a patient would not receive an injection of radioisotope if adequate exercise was achieved without symptoms and a negative ECG response. This protocol would save a substantial amount of time, radiation exposure, and cost. Method(s): All patients who underwent a stress SPECT MPI over a 6.5-year period from 2004 to 2010 were included. Patients who would have been considered for a standby injection protocol were: exercise stress, age < 65, no known coronary artery disease (CAD), and an interpretable ECG. Patients were retrospectively divided into two groups based on whether they would have received radioisotope or not. Criteria for not injecting included a maximal predicted heart rate >= 85%, >=10 METS of exercise, no symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath, and no ECG changes (ST depression or arrhythmia). The two groups were then compared based on MPI results and all-cause mortality derived from the Social Security Death Index. Result(s): A total of 24,689 patients underwent SPECT MPI during this period, and 5,352 would have been eligible for a provisional injection protocol. There were 3,791 (70.8%), who would have been injected and 1,561 (29.2%), who would not have been. Perfusion results were abnormal in 5.9% of non-injected group compared to 14.4% in those who would have been injected. After a mean follow-up of 60.6 +/- 21.4 months, 1.1% had died in the non-injected cohort compared to 2.2% in the injected group. Conclusion(s): A provisional injection protocol defined as age < 65, normal rest ECG, no history of CAD, and high level exercise with a negative ECG response and no symptoms has a very low 5-year all-cause mortality and low yield of MPI. If adopted it would decrease radiation exposure and save time and health care costs without jeopardizing prognosis. © 2013 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.",Excluded,0.17217463

Purpose(s): To report the preoperative scintigraphic imaging findings in 79 patients with MRI documented medial meniscus tears and normal radiographs. Material(s) and Method(s): 79 adults (66 males and 13 females) without a history of prior injury or surgery between the ages of 27 and 61 (mean age 41) were included in the study. All patients had a normal preoperative Rosenberg x-ray (weight bearing PA radiograph) an MRI diagnostic of a structurally damaged medial meniscus, and a standard three-hour delayed technetium 99m-MDP bone scan of the knees.

Discussion(s): Loss of osseous homeostasis of the medial compartment of knees with documented medial meniscus tears was present at a time when the radiographic findings were normal. The conceptualization of the extent of the pathology in such patients needs to include loss of osseous homeostasis. Future studies documenting the post-operative history of surgically treated patients with medial meniscus tears may yield information of interest regarding the development of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. It is postulated that the persistent post-operative loss of osseous homeostasis may identify those knees as ones at risk of the early development of OA, whereas the restoration of osseous homeostasis may be an important marker that such knees are not at risk for the development of OA.",Excluded,0.17194213

Both gender and age at the time of exposure have been established as key determinants of cataractogenesis induced by sparsely ionizing (low-LET) and densely ionizing (high-LET) radiation. However, animal data from several older studies are often conflicting and somewhat difficult to interpret, in that the experiments suffered from small group sizes, limited dose ranges or short periods of observation, and human data are sparse or statistical significance is sometimes limited.

658,1896,"Effect of intraoperative three-dimensional imaging during the reduction and fixation of displaced calcaneal fractures on articular congruence and implant fixation Background: Operative treatment of displaced calcaneal fractures should restore joint congruence, but conventional fluoroscopy is unable to fully visualize the subtalar joint. We questioned whether intraoperative 3-dimensional (3D) imaging would aid in the reduction of calcaneal fractures, resulting in improved articular congruence and implant positioning. Method(s): Sixty-two displaced calcaneal fractures were operated on using standard fluoroscopic views. When the surgeon had achieved a satisfactory reduction, an intraoperative 3D scan was conducted, malreductions or implant imperfections were revised, the calcaneus was rescanned, and this sequence was repeated until the optimal operative result was achieved. Result(s): Five fractures underwent 1 intraoperative scan, 39 fractures underwent 2 scans, 13 fractures underwent 3 scans, and 5 fractures underwent 4 scans. The average number of scans was 2.3. Intraoperative scanning led to re-reduction and improvement of reduction in 13 fractures, change of plate position in 1 patient, optimizing of the screw directions in 5 fractures, and shortening of screws that were intra-articular or protruding medially in 6 fractures. The postoperative articular displacement was 0 mm in 69% of the Sanders type 2 fractures and 57% of the Sanders type 3 fractures. Operation duration averaged 118 minutes, and there were no reoperations due to misplaced screws or plates. The average absorbed radiation dose per patient was 288 mGy*cm.

Mediastinal nodal sterilization (MNS) after induction chemoradiotherapy (CRT) can serve as an intermediate marker for efficacy. NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0229 demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of combining full-dose radiation (61.2 Gy) with chemotherapy followed by resection and chemotherapy. On the basis of that experience and evidence that EGFR antibodies are radiosensitizing, we explored adding panitumumab to CRT followed by resection and consolidation chemotherapy in locally advanced NSCLC with a primary end point of MNS. Methods Patients with resectable locally advanced NSCLC were eligible if deemed suitable for trimodality therapy before treatment. Surgeons were required to demonstrate expertise after CRT and adhere to specific management guidelines. Concurrent CRT consisted of weekly carboplatin (area under the curve = 2.0), paclitaxel (50 mg/m2), and 60 Gy of radiation therapy delivered in 30 fractions. There was a 2:1 randomization in favor of panitumumab at 2.5 mg/kg weekly for 6 weeks. The mediastinum was pathologically reassessed before or at the time of resection. Consolidation chemotherapy was weekly carboplatin (area under the curve = 6) and paclitaxel, 200 mg/m2 every 21 days for two courses. The study was designed to detect an improvement in MNS from 52% to 72%. With use of a 0.15 one-sided type 1 error and 80% power, 97 patients were needed. Results The study was opened in November 2010 and closed in August 2015 by the Data Monitoring Committee after 71 patients had been accrued for futility and excessive toxicity in the experimental arm. A total of 60 patients were eligible: 19 patients (86%) who received CRT and 29 (76%) who received CRT plus panitumumab and underwent an operation. With regard to postoperative toxicity, there were three grade 4 adverse events (13.6%) and no grade 5 adverse events (0%) among those who received CRT versus six grade 4 (15.8%) and four grade 5 adverse events (10.5%) among those who received CRT plus panitumumab. The MNS rates were 68.2% (95% confidence interval: 45.1-86.1) and 50.0% (95% confidence interval: 33.4-66.6) for CRT and CRT plus panitumumab, respectively (p = 0.95). Conclusion The addition of panitumumab to CRT did not improve MNS. There was an unexpectedly high mortality rate in the panitumumab arm, although the relationship to panitumumab is unclear.

661,1899,"Baseline MAPK signaling activity confers intrinsic radioresistance to KRAS-mutant colorectal carcinoma cells by rapid upregulation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) is overexpressed in malignant tumors and involved in DNA damage response upon ionizing radiation (IR). Here, we investigate its role in radioresistance of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and evaluate a pharmacological approach to enhance CRC radiosensitivity via downregulation of hnRNP K. We show that hnRNP K is overexpressed in CRC tissue specimens and upregulated in response to IR in vitro, which occurs faster in KRAS-mutant CRC cells. HnRNP K knockdown impairs cell survival, cell cycle progression and KRAS-dependent radioresistance and increases apoptosis. Using the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay, a decrease in xenograft tumor growth and radioresistance upon hnRNP K depletion could be verified in vivo, and comparable effects were achieved by suppression of hnRNP K expression using the MEK inhibitor MEK162 (Binimetinib). In summary, KRAS-mutant CRC shows intrinsic radioresistance along with rapid upregulation of hnRNP K in response to IR that can effectively be targeted by MEK inhibition. Our results point towards a possible use of MAPK pathway inhibitors to decrease radioresistance of KRAS-mutant CRC via downregulation of hnRNP K.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded,0.91188926
662,1900,"Human fiber size and enzymatic properties after 5 and 11 days of spaceflight Biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were obtained from three astronauts before and after two 5-day flights and from five astronauts before and after one 11-day flight (space shuttle flights: STS-32, -33, and -34). Muscle fibers from two separate samples from each biopsy were classified as type I and II or as type I, IIA, and IIB by using qualitative myofibrillar adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) staining. Cross-sectional area (CSA), number of capillaries per fiber, and the activities of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD), and myofibrillar ATPase were determined from one sample of fibers of each myofibrillar ATPase type. Postflight biopsies had 6-8% fewer type I fibers than preflight. Mean fiber CSAs were 16-36% smaller after the 11-day flight with the relative effect being type IIB > IIA > I. Mean fiber CSAs were 11 and 24% smaller in type I and II fibers after 5 days of flight. Myofibrillar ATPase activities increased in type II but not in type I fibers after flight, whereas SDH activity was unaffected in either fast or slow fibers. GPD activity in type I fibers was approximately 80% higher (P > 0.05) postflight compared with preflight. Myofibrillar ATPase/SDH ratios in type II fibers were higher after than before flight, suggesting that some fast fibers were more susceptible to fatigue after flight. The GPD/SDH ratios were elevated in some type I fibers after spaceflight. The number of capillaries per fiber was 24% lower after than before flight, whereas the number of capillaries per unit CSA of muscle tissue was unchanged. These data suggest that adaptations in the size, metabolic properties, and vascularity of muscle fibers can occur rapidly in the space environment. These adaptations were qualitatively similar to those observed in animals after actual or simulated spaceflight conditions for short periods.",Excluded,0.20129928
663,1901,"Validation of a New Method for 2D Fusion Imaging Registration in a System Prepared Only for 3D Purpose: To validate a new 2D-3D registration method of fusion imaging during aortic repair in a system prepared only for 3D-3D registration and to compare radiation doses and accuracy. Materials and Methods: The study involved 189 patients, including 94 patients (median age 70 years; 85 men) who underwent abdominal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with 2D-3D fusion on an Artis zee imaging system and 95 EVAR patients (median age 70 years; 81 men) from a prior study who had 3D-3D registration done using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). For the 2D-3D registration, an offline CBCT of the empty operating table was imported into the intraoperative dataset and superimposed on the preoperative computed tomography angiogram (CTA). Then 2 intraoperative single-frame 2D images of the skeleton were aligned with the patient's skeleton on the preoperative CTA to complete the registration process. A digital subtraction angiogram was done to correct any misalignment of the aortic CTA volume. Values are given as the median [interquartile range (IQR) Q1, Q3]. Results: The 2D-3D registration had an accuracy of 4.0 mm (IQR 3.0, 5.0) after bone matching compared with the final correction with DSA (78% within 5 mm). By applying the 2D-3D protocol the radiation exposure (dose area product) from the registration of the fusion image was significantly reduced compared with the 3D-3D registration [1.12 Gy.cm2 (IQR 0.41, 2.14) vs 43.4 Gy.cm2 (IQR 37.1, 49.0), respectively; p<0.001). Conclusion: The new 2D-3D registration protocol based on 2 single-frame images avoids an intraoperative CBCT and can be used for fusion imaging registration in a system originally designed for 3D-3D only. This 2D-3D registration protocol is accurate and leads to a significant reduction in radiation exposure.",Excluded,0.17082645

665,1903,"Patient radiation exposure measurements during interventional procedures: a prospective study This is a prospective study with the purpose of assessing patient radiation dose and stochastic risk (risk for fatal cancer) in a patient population undergoing interventional radiological (IR) procedures. Measurements were performed on 36 consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA, n=18), transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS, n=3), diagnostic angiography (DA, n=6), arterial embolization (AE, n=3), and hepatic neoplasm chemoembolization (HCE, n=6). Kerma area product (KAP) was used as a measure of x-ray exposure to the patient. Mean KAP value per procedure was 79+/-50 Gy cm for PTA, 139+/-55 Gy cm for TIPS, 110+/-44 Gy cm for DA, 325+/-145 Gy cm for AE, and 150+/-76 Gy cm for HCE. Forty-six percent of total KAP value was attributed to fluoroscopy. In conclusion, we showed that a linear correlation between effective dose and KAP was found (r=0.84), which could be used for estimating patient effective dose using KAP measurements. Small changes to the number of digital frames acquired result in substantial change of the total KAP in interventional radiological procedures. Stochastic risk from IR procedures is quite low for the patient. Measuring KAP is a simple and accurate method, which provides the interventional radiologist with a good estimation of the patient's relative risk for stochastic effects.",Excluded,0.17278454
667,1905,"Clinical characteristics of patients with intradialytic hypertension Introduction and Aims: Intradialytic hypertension with a prevalence of 15% among hemodialysis patients is with unknown pathophysiology, demographic, laboratory and clinical characteristic of patients, and it's influence on long - lasting clinical effects (cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, rate of hospitalization). So, the aim of the study is to present the clinical, laboratory and demographic characteristics of patients with intradialytic hypertension in our dialysis center. Method(s): Of total 110 hemodialysis patients, 17 patients (15,45%) were intradialytic hypertensive - started at a systolic pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or had an increase in systolic pressure more than 10 mm Hg during the session, and 17 patients were normotensive or had a drop in blood pressure during the dialysis. HD were performed 3 times per week with a duration of 4-5 hours, on machines with controlled ultrafiltration and high flux syntetic membrane ( polyetersulfon) sterilized with gamma rays. It was used dialysate with standard electrolytes content (Na+ 138 mmol/L, K+ 2,0 mmol/L, Ca++ 1,5 mmol/L, Mg +1,0 mmol/L, CH3COO- 3,0 mmol/L, Cl -110 mmol/l, HCO3- 35 mmol/L). Analysed demographic and clinical characteristics were: gender, age, BMI, dialysis vintage, vascular acces, cardiovascular comorbidity (cardiomyopathy, ischemic cardiac disease, peripheral artery disease, heart valve disease), number and type of antihypertensive drugs, a weekly dose of erythropoesis - stimulating agent, standard monthly, three and six months laboratory analyzes, and sp Kt/V and PCR. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 17.0. Result(s): In the both groups were more men (IDH group 88,23%, control group 64,07%). IDH group was older (59,00+/- 7,64 versus 49.00+/- 13,91, p= 0,314) and with lower BMI (p = 0,246) compared to control group. Significantly lower serum sodium and higher sodium gradient had IDH patients (135,75+/-2,03 versus 137,33 +/-1,97, p= 0,042; 2,25+/-1,98 versus 0,66+/-1,44, p=0,0267, respestively). In other laboratory analysis there was no statistically significant differences between two groups. IDH group had significantly higher interdialysis weight gain and less effective ultrafiltration individually at each dialysis session compared to the control group (2,23 +/-0,866 versus 2,37+/-0,69, p=0,011; 3,87+/-1,26 versus 3,56+/-1.18, p=0,025, respectively). The systolic and mean arterial pressure after the HD were statistically higher in IDH group, receiving multiple antihypertensive drugs and have more cardiovascular diseases compared to patients without intradialytic hypertension.

669,1907,"Development and validation of a nomogram for prediction of survival and local control in laryngeal carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy alone: A cohort study based on 994 patients Introduction: To advise laryngeal carcinoma patients on the most appropriate form of treatment, a tool to predict survival and local control is needed. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a population-based cohort study on 994 laryngeal carcinoma patients, treated with RT from 1977 until 2008. Two nomograms were developed and validated. Performance of the models is expressed as the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Result(s): Unfavorable prognostic factors for overall survival were low hemoglobin level, male sex, high T-status, nodal involvement, older age, lower EQD2T (total radiation dose corrected for fraction dose and overall treatment time), and non-glottic tumor. All factors except tumor location were prognostic for local control. The AUCs were 0.73 for overall survival and 0.67 for local control. External validation of the survival model yielded AUCs of 0.68, 0.74, 0.76 and 0.71 for the Leuven (n = 109), the VU Amsterdam (n = 178), the Manchester (n = 403) and the NKI cohort (n = 205), respectively, while the validation procedure for the local control model resulted in AUCs of 0.70, 0.71, 0.72 and 0.62. The resulting nomograms were made available on the website www.predictcancer.org. Conclusion(s): For patients with a laryngeal carcinoma treated with RT alone, we have developed visual, easy-to-use nomograms for the prediction of overall survival and primary local control.

672,1910,"3D mapping for the identification of the fossa ovalis in left atrial ablation procedures: A pilot study of a first step towards an electroanatomic-guided transseptal puncture Aims Transseptal puncture (TP) for left atrial (LA) catheter ablation procedures is routinely performed under fluoroscopic guidance. To decrease radiation exposure and increase safety alternative techniques are desirable. The aim of this study was to assess whether right atrial (RA) electroanatomic 3D mapping can reliably identify the fossa ovalis (FO) in preparation of TP. Methods Between May 2019 and August 2019, electroanatomic RA mapping was performed before TP in 61 patients with and results paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. Three electroanatomic methods for FO identification, mapping catheter-induced FO protrusion, electroanatomic-guided analysis, and voltage mapping, were evaluated and compared with transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE). Mapping catheter-induced FO protrusion was feasible in 60 patients (98%) with a mean displacement of 6.8 +/- 2.5 mm, confirmed by TOE, and proofed to be the most valuable and easiest marker for FO identification. Electroanatomic-guided analysis localized the FO midpoint consistently in the lower half (43 +/- 7%) and posterior (18.2 +/- 4.4 mm) to a line between coronary sinus and vena cava superior. Analysis of RA voltage maps during sinus rhythm (n = 40, low-voltage cut-off value 1.0 and 1.5 mV) allowed secure FO recognition in 33% and 18%, only. A step-by-step approach, combining FO protrusion (first step) with anatomy criteria in case of protrusion failure (second step) would have allowed for the correct localization of a TP site within the FO in all patients. Conclusion Right atrial electroanatomic 3D mapping prior to TP proofed to be a simple tool for FO identification and may potentially be of use in the safe and radiation-free performance of TP prior to LA ablation procedures.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded,0.17144075
673,1911,"A simplified approach to pulmonary vein visualization in cryo-balloon ablation of atrial fibrillation Background: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) by cryo balloon (CB) ablation is an effective and effcient alternative to radio frequency ablation in patients with atrial fbrillation (AF). It requires less technical infrastructure (e.g. 3D mapping systems) and typically has a steeper learning curve. Selective, multiplanar pulmonary vein (PV) angiography (PVA) has been established as the gold standard for PV visualization in CB PVI. Objective(s): We aimed to simplify this approach to achieve a reduction of procedural complexity and radiation exposure Methods: Patients with paroxysmal or early persistent AF undergoing CB based PVI from Jan. 2015 to Dec. 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients received conventional (PVA) or unselective left atrial angiography (LAA) for PV visualization. LAA was acquired by contrast injection in the AP projection. Also, in the LAA group the AP plane was maintained during the CB procedure, unless satisfactory PV occlusion could not be achieved. Result(s): 336 patients were analyzed (female n=127, 38%; age 62+/-0.6 years; BMI 27+/-0.2 kg/m2; LA volume 66+/-2.4 ml; EHRA 2.3+/-0.04; CHA2DS2-VASc 2.0+/-0.1). 87 patients (26%) received PVA and 249 (74%) LAA. No signifcant differences in clinical characteristics were observed. LAA required fewer PV visualization sequences (2.0+/-0.05 vs 2.0+/-0.05; p<0.0001), resulting in reduced procedure (93+/-1.79 vs 110.8+/-3.18 min; p<0.0001), as well as lower fuoroscopy time (14.2+/-0.43 vs 19+/-0.78 min; p<0.0001) and radiation dose (634.6+/-69.58 vs 1574+/-190.8 cGcm2; p<0.0001). There was a trend to lower contrast use (78.7+/-2.8 vs. 91.3+/-5.99 ml; p=0.0573). Markers of procedural quality (PV occlusion, CB temperature, time to isolation) showed no signifcant differences. Number of CB applications (1.4+/-0.02 vs. 1.6+/-0.05; p<0.0001) and total application time per vein (297.9+/-4.62 vs. 348.9+/-11.03 seconds; p<0.0001) were slightly but signifcantly higher in the PVA group. Minor complications were equally distributed between both groups. Only one major complication (stroke) was observed in the PVA group.

675,1913,"Dynamic CT for parathyroid adenoma detection: How does radiation dose compare with nuclear medicine? OBJECTIVE. Dynamic CT is increasingly used for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas, but concerns remain about the radiation effective dose of CT compared with that of99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation dose delivered by three-phase dynamic CT with that delivered by99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT performed in accordance with our current protocols and to assess the possible reduction in effective dose achieved by decreasing the scan length (i.e., z-axis) of two phases of the dynamic CT protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The effective dose of a99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine parathyroid study performed with and without coregistration CT was calculated and compared with the effective dose of our current three-phase dynamic CT protocol as well as a proposed protocol involving CT with reduced scan length. RESULTS. The median effective dose for a99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine study was 5.6 mSv. This increased to 12.4 mSv with the addition of coregistration CT, which is higher than the median effective dose of 9.3 mSv associated with the dynamic CT protocol. Reducing the scan length of two phases in the dynamic CT protocol could reduce the median effective dose to 6.1 mSv, which would be similar to that of the dose from the99mTc-sestamibi study alone. CONCLUSION. Dynamic CT used for the detection of parathyroid adenoma can deliver a lower radiation dose than99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT. It may be possible to reduce the dose further by decreasing the scan length of two of the phases, although whether this has an impact on accuracy of the localization needs further investigation.Copyright © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded,0.17176747

The mean dose and the partial volumes receiving specified doses were determined for each gland from dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Nonstimulated and stimulated saliva flow rates were selectively measured from each parotid gland before RT and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the completion of RT. The data were fit using a generalized linear model and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model of Lyman-Kutcher. In the latter model, a ""severe complication"" was defined as salivary flow rate reduced to < or =25% pre-RT flow at 12 months., RESULTS: Saliva flow rates data were available for 152 parotid glands. Glands receiving a mean dose below or equal to a threshold (24 Gy for the unstimulated and 26 Gy for the stimulated saliva) showed substantial preservation of the flow rates following RT and continued to improve over time (to median 76% and 114% of pre-RT for the unstimulated and stimulated flow rates, respectively, at 12 months). In contrast, most glands receiving a mean dose higher than the threshold produced little saliva with no recovery over time. The output was not found to decrease as mean dose increased, as long as the threshold dose was not reached. Similarly, partial volume thresholds were found: 67%, 45%, and 24% gland volumes receiving more than 15 Gy, 30 Gy, and 45 Gy, respectively. The partial volume thresholds correlated highly with the mean dose and did not add significantly to a model predicting the saliva flow rate from the mean dose and the time since RT. The NTCP model parameters were found to be TD50 (the tolerance dose for 50% complications rate for whole organ irradiated uniformly) = 28.4 Gy, n (volume dependence parameter) = 1, and m (the slope of the dose/response relationship) = 0.18. Clinical factors including age, gender, pre-RT surgery, chemotherapy, and certain medical conditions were not found to be significantly associated with the salivary flow rates. Medications (diuretics, antidepressants, and narcotics) were found to adversely affect the unstimulated but not the stimulated flow rates., CONCLUSIONS: Dose/volume/function relationships in the parotid glands are characterized by dose and volume thresholds, steep dose/response relationships when the thresholds are reached, and a maximal volume dependence parameter in the NTCP model. A parotid gland mean dose of < or =26 Gy should be a planning goal if substantial sparing of the gland function is desired.",Excluded,0.19804135

It minimizes uncertainties regarding delineation and safety margins and could reduce dose exposure of the healthy brain (HB). Method(s): We performed a systematic treatment plan comparison on 24 patients who received post-operative radiosurgery of the resection cavity at our institution. Comparative treatment plans were calculated for hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (7 x 5 Gray (Gy)) in a hypothetical pre-operative (pre-op) and two post-operative scenarios, either with (extended field, post-op-E) or without the surgical tract (involved field, post-op-I). Detailed volumetric comparison of the resulting target volumes was performed, as well as dosimetric comparison focusing on targets and the HB. Result(s): The resection cavity was significantly smaller and different in morphology from the pre-operative lesion, yielding a low Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 53% (p = 0.019). Post-op-I and post-op-E targets showed high similarity (DSC = 93%), and including the surgical tract moderately enlarged resulting median target size (18.58 ccm vs. 22.89 ccm, p < 0.001). Dosimetric analysis favored the pre-operative treatment setting since it significantly decreased relevant dose exposure of the HB (Median volume receiving 28 Gy: 6.79 vs. 10.79 for pre-op vs. post-op-E, p < 0.001). Dosimetrically, pre-operative SRS is a promising alternative to post-operative cavity irradiation that could furthermore offer practical benefits regarding delineation and treatment planning. Comparative trials are required to evaluate potential clinical advantages of this approach.Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded,0.17183544

There are few studies to clarify neuroendocrine and inflammatory status and the possible consequences particularly in occupational exposure. Aim of the study. Our aim was to associate the redox and inflammatory biomarkers with either nightshift working or occupational radiation exposure, and to compare their levels between the two groups at Alexandria University Hospitals, Alexandria, Egypt. Method(s): We included 150 female nurses at Alexandria University Hospitals: 50 nightshift workers, 50 radiation workers, and 50 dayshift workers as a control group (neither work nightly nor radiation workers).

682,1920,"Time trend of patient setup deviations during pelvic irradiation using electronic portal imaging An electronic portal imaging device (EPID) was used to detect patient setup displacement during the course of a 3-field pelvic irradiation of two groups of patients: 10 rectal and 10 prostate carcinomas. These patients were irradiated with conventional treatment techniques in routine clinical practice. A total of 469 portal images and 60 simulator films were used to determine the values of setup deviations in the X- Y- and Z-directions of a fixed coordinate system, corresponding to the medio-lateral, cranio-caudal and antero-posterior direction, respectively. The absolute displacement averaged over all setups and patients ranged between 0.4 mm and 1.4 mm with a standard deviation (S.D.) of 1.6-3.9 mm. The overall distribution along each direction could be separated into a distribution of random deviations (S.D.s ranging from 1.2 to 2.8 mm) around the mean deviation of each patient and a distribution of the means themselves: the distribution of systematic deviations (S.D.s ranging from 1.0 to 2.6 mm). Significant gradual displacement as a function of time was detected in 5 out of the 20 patients, 2 in the rectum and 3 in the prostate group. This ""time trend"" was found along each of the 3 directions specified. The magnitude of the time-dependent displacement throughout the course of treatment ranged between 4 and 11 mm.

In all patients, dose-volumetric parameters were analyzed according to their relation to development of HT, and thyroid volumes spared from doses >=10, 20, 30, 40 and 50Gy (V10, V20, V30, V40 and V50) were analyzed from the dose volume histograms (DVHs)., RESULTS: Median follow-up duration was 31months. At the end of study, 33 patients (42.3%) developed HT and the cumulative incidence of HT was 24.6%, 36.5% and 42.3% at one, two and three years, respectively. V30 of 42.1% (P=0.005) was defined as dose-volumetric threshold of radiation-induced HT in HNSCC patients. Our analysis showed that V30 separates patients into low- and high-risk groups; the incidence of radiation-induced HT in the group with V30<42.1% and V30>=42.1% was 29.4% and 71.4%, respectively (P=0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: The V30 may predict risk of developing HT after RT for HNSCC patients.

This study aimed to determine the age-, gender- and body mass index (BMI)-related changes in the femoral neck, especially on the neck-shaft angle, by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements. Method s Retrospective analyses of DXA images of the proximal femur from 18,943 individuals aged 20-108 years were performed. The age, gender, weight and height of each individual were obtained at the time of bone measurement. Data on theta angle were obtained from DXA measurements. Simple linear regression analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to investigate the relationships between theta and age, gender and BMI. Results There was a significant correlation between theta and age (p < 0.001). We also found a significant difference between the various age groups using analysis of variance (p < 0.001), but there was no meaningful correlation between theta and BMI (p = 0.377) and the BMI groups (p = 0.180). There were small but statistically significant differences in the neck-shaft angle between males and females (p < 0.05). Conclusion In this study, DXA-based measurements were used and many parameters of proximal femur geometry were calculated with limited radiation exposure. We have demonstrated that the mean neck-shaft angle is greater in males than in females, and that theta increases with age.

689,1927,"A regenerative role for bone marrow following experimental colitis: Contribution to neovasculogenesis and myofibroblasts Background & Aims: Bone marrow (BM) cells form differentiated adult lineages within nonhematopoietic tissues, with a heightened propensity with increasing regenerative pressure dictated by disease. We have previously shown that BM cells engraft into the gut and contribute substantially to the subepithelial intestinal myofibroblast population in the lamina propria. To investigate the reparative capacity of BM in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a well-established model of experimental colitis was used. Method(s): Lethally irradiated female mice were rescued by a BM transplant from male donors. Colitis was induced 6 weeks posttransplantation by injection of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), and tissues were analyzed 1-14 days later. Donor-derived cells were detected by in situ hybridization using a Y chromosome-specific probe, and their phenotype was determined by immunohistochemistry. Result(s): TNBS-induced colitis was manifest as patchy lesions that increased in severity between days 1 and 8, and the mucosa gradually regenerated between days 8 and 14. The contribution of BM to intestinal myofibroblasts was significantly increased in regions of colitis compared with noninflamed regions. Furthermore, BM-derived endothelial cells, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells were frequently interspersed throughout blood vessels, suggesting that these cells facilitate angiogenesis in tissue repair, substantiated by a significant increase in the incidence of BM-derived vascular smooth muscle cells in colitic compared with noninflamed regions. Blood vessels formed entirely from BM-derived cells were also seen, suggesting a role for BM in neovasculogenesis. Conclusion(s): Our data show that BM contributes to multiple intestinal cell lineages in colitis, with an important function in tissue regeneration and vasculogenesis after injury. © 2005 by the American Gastroenterological Association.",Excluded,0.18982413

Doses of 20 and 45 Gy were delivered to the area of the AVM in 10 and 15 fractions with a 6-MV linear accelerator in case 1 and in cases 2 and 3, respectively. A blinded histopathological comparison was made of the latter cases and three AVMs removed at surgery that were not previously irradiated and that were comparable in size, number of arterial feeders, and location within the brain. Segmental hyalinization of some blood vessels was seen in both irradiated and nonirradiated cases. The single postmortem specimen showed extensive thrombosis but a patent nidus. The findings are in keeping with the clinical impression that conventional fractionated radiation therapy fails to alter the natural history of cerebral AVMs. The favorable outcome of radiosurgery on small- to medium-sized AVMs appears attributable to the shorter duration of therapy using relatively high-dose prescriptions to the nidus.",Excluded,0.92667884
691,1929,"The complex case of MACS J0717.5+3745 and its extended filament: Intra-cluster light, galaxy luminosity function, and galaxy orientations Context. The properties of galaxies are known to be affected by their environment, but although galaxies in clusters and groups have been quite thoroughly investigated, little is known about galaxies belonging to filaments of the cosmic web, or about the properties of the filaments themselves. Aims. Here we investigate the properties of the rich cluster MACS J0717.5+3745 and its extended filament by analyzing the distribution and fractions of intra-cluster light (ICL) in its core and by trying to detect intra-filament light (IFL) in the filament. We analyze the galaxy luminosity function (GLF) of the cluster core and of the filament. We also study the orientations of galaxies in the filament to better constrain the filament properties. Methods. This work is based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive data, both from the Hubble Frontier Fields in the F435W, F606W, F814W, and F105W bands, and from a mosaic of images in the F606W and F814W bands. The spatial distribution of the ICL was determined with our new wavelet-based software, DAWIS. The GLFs were extracted in the F606W and F814W bands, with a statistical subtraction of the background, and fit with Schechter functions. The galaxy orientations in the filaments were estimated with SExtractor after correction for the point spread function. Results. We detect a large amount of ICL in the cluster core, but no IFL in the cosmic filament. The fraction of ICL in the core peaks in the F606W filter before decreasing with wavelength. Though relatively noisy, the GLFs in the filament are notably different from those of field galaxies, with a flatter faint end slope and an excess of bright galaxies. We do not detect a significant alignment of the galaxies in the filament region analyzed. 2019 A. Ellien et al.",Excluded,0.18265721
692,1930,"Hearing preservation in vestibular schwannoma management Objective To compare hearing preservation between stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) and conservative treatment of patients with unilateral vestibular schwannoma. Data sources Retrospective case series comparing hearing outcomes of patients with a unilateral vestibular schwannoma managed conservatively or with stereotactic radiotherapy in a tertiary care academic centre. Review methods Patients: Tumor database patients with American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Class A or B hearing at the onset of study. Stereotactic radiotherapy patients were predominantly those who failed conservative management. Intervention(s): Audiometric pure tone averages and speech discrimination scores as well as patient demographics, tumor location, size and growth were extracted. Main Outcome Measure(s): Hearing outcome measures were: 1) Hearing Preservation, i.e. no drop from Class A/B to Class C/D hearing, 2) Hearing Survival of Class A/B hearing in months, 3) Audiometric Pure Tone Averages, Difference between post-treatment and pre-treatment, and 4) Speech Discrimination Score Difference (pre-treatment - post treatment). Survival analysis and non-parametric tests were used for hearing outcome measures, with multiple covariates tested. Results Overall, serviceable hearing preservation among the 123 patients was 51%. The median hearing survival time was 46 months (mean 59 months). The Pure Tone averages and Speech Discrimination score differences were 16 dB and 82% respectively over a median follow-up time of 43 months. No significant difference was found between the conservative and SRT groups in any hearing outcome. Class A patients showed far better hearing survival than Class B patients. Conclusions No significant difference was demonstrated as to measures of hearing outcomes between stereotactic radiotherapy and conservative management. Excellent existing hearing appears to be the best predictor of long term hearing survival in the cohort studied.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.58357155
694,1932,"Cumulative ionizing radiation to image the small bowel: Are we really exceeding the safety limits? Introduction: Radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging of the small bowel is common in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. Increased risk of malignancy has been associated with radiation exposure. For solid cancers this follows a linear-no-threshold model. Current data (BEIR VII) demonstrates that exposure to 100mGY to population of mixed ages, the life time attributable risk (LAR) of solid organ malignancy is 8 per 1000 of exposed persons for males and 13.1 per 1000 for females. This varies according to age of exposure exposure to 100mGY at age 10 confers a risk of 1.33% for males (2.53% for females); at age 30 this is 0.6% for males (1% for females) and at age 50 it is 0.51% for males (0.68% for females). 100mGY exposure confers a LAR (in a linear-quadratic model) for leukaemia of 1 per 1000 for males and 0.72 per 1000 for females. This varies from 1.2 per 1000 exposed males at age 10 (0.86 for females) to 0.84 per 1000 males exposed at age 30 (0.49 for females). The risk remains the same for males aged 50 and decreases to 0.30 per 1000 females exposed aged 50. Aim and Method: Aim: To determine the cumulative ionizing radiation exposure in mGY secondary to non-acute small bowel (SB) imaging in CD patients. Method(s): Patients were identified from our database. Their SB investigations were extracted. Radiation exposure for the procedures was obtained from the Physics division of the radiology department. Result(s): 80 CD patients (males 42 patient) were identified. The time since the diagnosis of CD varied from 41 years to 5 months (mean 8.6 years). 56 patients (30 males) were exposed to ionizing radiation to image the SB. Table 1 denotes the total number of exposures per age group and gender. 15 male and 5 female patients had SB stricturing disease. 2 female patients had fistulising SB disease. Table 2 demonstrates cumulative ionizing radiation secondary to non-acute small bowel imaging. Conclusion(s): 70% of the CD patients were exposed to diagnostic ionizing radiation as to image the small bowel. This radiation exposure reached more than 50mGY in 15% of patients and more than 100mGY in 8.75% our Study group. These results demonstrate the high ionizing radiation with the possible consequences that CD patients are exposed to throughout their lifetime. Thus we suggest that efforts should be done to image the small bowel by non-ionizing radiation such as MRI. In places where this is not available the request for ionizing radiation should only be done by specialists in close liason with the radiologists. (Table presented).",Excluded,0.17700824

This system is an ergometer to be flown and installed in the International Space Station in the year 2004. The system consists of a control electronics that controls a motor, to which a subject is connected by means of a restraining system named HRS (Human Restraint System). This ergometer can be used for 11 movements (wrist flexion/extension, wrist pronation/supination, and wrist radial/ulnar deviation; trunk flexion/extension; arm pull/press, leg pull/press; elbow flexion/extension; Shoulder flexion/extension; hip flexion/extension; knee flexion/extension; and ankle dorsal/plantar flexion). The HRS must meet the following anthropometric range: from 5 percentile Japanese female to 95 percentile American male. The complete MARES system follow the verification of the specifications set at the start of the project. As part of this verification, it was necessary to perform what we have called a ""Population Testing"", that is a test verifying those specifications where the interaction with a human being is unavoidable to check the compliance: Anthropometric range Supported movements Nominal position Impairment Body position reproducibility Electrodes compatibility Joint alignment stability Comfort These verification tests included a population sample of six people per movement covering from 5 percentile Japanese female to 95 percentile American.

698,1936,"New strategy for lower advanced rectal cancer : Preoperative chemoradiotherapy with uft/leucovorin/ irinotecan regimen BACKGROUND: We previously reported that UFT/leucovorin/ irinotecan (TEGAFIRI) is a feasible chemotherapy regimen for preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for lower advanced rectal cancer (LARC) in a phase I/II trial. Here we report the short-term outcomes for further accumulated LARC cases treated with this regimen. METHOD(S): A total of 41 LARC patients were treated with preoperative CRT with TEGAFIRI regimen (irinotecan 80 mg/m2 on day 1, 15, 29, 43, UFT 300 mg/m2 and leucovorin 75 mg/ body with irradiation 50.4 Gy/28Fr) followed by curative intent surgery. The relative dose intensity (RDI), adverse events (AEs), surgical findings, and pathological regression grade and complete response (pCR) rate were examined. RESULT(S): The mean RDI was 0.86 for irinotecan, 0.97 for UFT, and 0.998 for irradiation. Grade 3 AEs were diarrhea in 5 patients (12.1%), anemia in 4 (9.8%), and leukopenia and neutropenia in 3 (7.3%) respectively, and no grade 4 or 5 AEs were observed. The circumferential resection margin was negative in all cases. The pathological regression grade 1a/1b/ 2/3 was observed in 4/10/20/7 cases, and the pCR rate was 17.1%. In 26 patients treated with irinotecan at 80 mg/m2, the pCR rate was 19.2% and the grade 2/3 regression was observed in 73.1% of the patients.

700,1938,"Phase II study of preoperative helical tomotherapy with a simultaneous integrated boost for rectal cancer PURPOSE: The addition of concomitant chemotherapy to preoperative radiotherapy is considered the standard of care for patients with cT3-4 rectal cancer. The combined treatment modality increases the complete response rate and local control (LC), but has no impact on survival or the incidence of distant metastases. In addition, it is associated with considerable toxicity. As an alternative strategy, we explored prospectively, preoperative helical tomotherapy with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 108 patients were treated with intensity-modulated and image-guided radiotherapy using the Tomotherapy Hi-Art II system. A dose of 46 Gy, in daily fractions of 2 Gy, was delivered to the mesorectum and draining lymph nodes, without concomitant chemotherapy. Patients with an anticipated circumferential resection margin (CRM) of less than 2 mm, based on magnetic resonance imaging, received a SIB to the tumor up to a total dose of 55.2 Gy. Acute and late side effects were scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0., RESULTS: A total of 102 patients presented with cT3-4 tumors; 57 patients entered the boost group and 51 the no-boost group. One patient in the no-boost group developed a radio-hypersensitivity reaction, resulting in a complete tumor remission, a Grade 3 acute and Grade 5 late enteritis. No other Grade >=3 acute toxicities occurred. With a median follow-up of 32 months, Grade >=3 late gastrointestinal and urinary toxicity were observed in 6% and 4% of the patients, respectively. The actuarial 2-year LC, progression-free survival and overall survival were 98%, 79%, and 93%., CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative helical tomotherapy displays a favorable acute toxicity profile in patients with cT3-4 rectal cancer.

All patients were assessed for resectability after 6 weeks by clinical examination and by CT scan and those deemed resectable underwent surgery., RESULTS: A total of 90 patients were randomized, 46 to Arm 1 and 44 to Arm 2. Eighty seven patients (44 in Arm 1 and 41 in Arm 2) completed the prescribed treatment protocol. Overall resectability rate was low in both the groups; R0 resection was achieved in 20 (43 %) patients in Arm 1 vs. 15 (34 %) in Arm 2. Adverse factors that significantly affected the resectability rate in both the groups were extension of tumor to pelvic bones and signet ring cell pathology. Complete pathological response was seen in 7 and 11 %, respectively. There was greater morbidity such as wound infection and delayed wound healing in Arm 2 (16 vs. 40 %; p = 0.03)., CONCLUSION: Escalated radiation dose without chemotherapy does not achieve higher complete (R0) tumor resectability in locally advanced inoperable rectal cancers, compared to concurrent chemoradiation.",Excluded,0.17574418
703,1941,"Epidemiology of lung cancer in women: A hospital-based descriptive study Objective: Lung cancer required much greater attention as it is the most common cause of death. According to statistics in 2010, 85% of lung cancer in men and 57% in women are attributed to tobacco smoking. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical and pathologic characteristics of the female patients who visited the Department of Medical Oncology of Acibadem Maslak Hospital between 2009 and 2017. Material(s) and Method(s): Clinicopathologic data collected for analyses included age at diagnosis, history of cigarette use, comorbid conditions, family history, tumor-node-metastasis stage, pathologic subtypes of lung carcinoma, and the given therapy. From July 2017 to February 2018, we collected data of 540 female patients with lung cancer at the Department of Medical Oncology of Acibadem Maslak Hospital. Result(s): Among 540 patients, 185 patients (34.3%) were nonsmokers, 106 (19.6%) were current smokers, and 210 (38.9%) were former smokers. Data on common comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease were collected, and the conditions were classified according to the smoking status of the patients. Among current and former smokers, 36.7% were diagnosed with hypertension, 18.3% with diabetes mellitus, and 11% with coronary artery diseases. Moreover, 75% of all patients were diagnosed with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whereas 16% were diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type of cancer seen in patients with NSCLC (77%), followed by patients with squamous cell carcinoma (15%). Conclusion(s): Factors other than tobacco use, such as radon exposure, air pollution, radiation exposure, and an unbalanced diet are responsible for the increasing incidence of lung cancer. However, further studies are warranted to investigate the cause of the epidemic differences in women, particularly the gender bias in nonsmoker patients with lung cancer.Copyright © 2020 by Turkish Society of Medical Oncology.",Excluded,0.17432904
706,1944,"Hand osteoid osteoma: Evaluation of diagnosis and treatment Background: OO (osteoid osteoma) is a common, osteoblastic, benign bone tumor but rarely seen in the hand region. There is still some debate about the diagnosis and treatment of hand OOs. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the epidemiology, radiologic features, surgical treatment options and functional outcomes. Method(s): Between January 2003 and December 2014, surgically treated and pathologically verified 9 hand OO cases were investigated retrospectively. The preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were calculated using the M2-DASH (Manchester-Modified Disabilities of Arm Shoulder and Hand) Score. Result(s): Lesion locations were as follows: middle phalanx in 2/9 (22%) patients (2nd and 4th digit), proximal phalanx in 6/9 (67%) patients (one 4th, two 2nd and three 5th digits) and metacarpal (2nd) in 1/9 (11%) patient. Incidence of nidus formation was 6/9 (67%) on X-ray, 7/9 (78%) on CT imaging and 2/9 (22%) on MR imaging. The mean time to diagnosis was 13.22 +/- 5.44 months. Preoperative mean M2-DASH score was 41 +/- 6 and postoperative was 7.4 +/- 8.6. Conclusion(s): Osteoid osteoma is usually seen below 25 years, and rarely found over 40 years of age. There is male dominance with a male to female ratio of 3:1. Delay of diagnosis may be encountered because of many differential diagnoses. When OO is suspected, CT imaging should be taken before the MR imaging.

707,1945,"Left ventricular noncompaction diagnosed by cardiac computed tomography Introduction: Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is characterized by a 2-layered myocardium composed of a noncompacted (NC) and a compacted (C) layer. The endsystolic NC:C ratio measured by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) has been established as a major diagnostic criterion; however, it is not easy to apply in all patients. Cardiac computed tomography (CCT) might provide an added value, but limited diagnostic criteria are available. Method(s): TTE and prospective ECG-triggered CCT were performed in 17 patients with previously diagnosed LVNC and in 19 healthy controls (Fig 1) and segmental analysis was performed. In TTE, each segment was analysed in parasternal short axis view and maximal thickness of NC and C was measured in the segment with most prominent recesses/trabeculations during enddiastole and endsystole. In CCT maximal thickness of NC and C was measured in each segment during enddiastole (75% of R-R interval). Segmental CCT NC:C ratio was calculated and compared between LVNC and control. Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated between TTE and CCT segmental ratios. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to validate cut-off values for distinguishing LVNC from control on a per-segment and a per-patient basis. Result(s): The median [IQR] radiation dose for CCT was 1.3 [1.2-1.5]mSv. The CCT segmental median [IQR] thickness of the C layer was significantly lower in patients with LVNC compared to controls: inferolateral-midventricular (7.8 [6.8-9.8] vs 8.8 [7.8-9.5]mm), lateral- (6.2 [5.9-8.0] vs 8.3 [7.5-9.3] mm), inferior- (6.3 [5.7-6.7] vs 7.8 [6.9-8.4]mm), and septal-apical (6.9 [6.0-7.5] vs 7.9 [7.2-8.8] mm). The median CCT NC:C ratio differed between control and LVNC in the inferior-midventricular and in all apical segments (p< 0.05; Fig 2A). The infero-apical segment was that with most prominent recesses/trabeculations in both TTE (72%) and CCT (44%) (Fig 2B). NC:C ratio correlated significantly between CCT and TTE (both at enddiastole (=0.8) and endsystole (=0.9)). A CCT NC:C ratio of >1.7 distinguished LVNC with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 96, 99, 95, and 100% on segmental analysis (Fig 2C). Using this cut-off value, all LVNC patients could be identified (Fig 2D). Conclusion(s): LVNC can be diagnosed with ECG-triggered low-dose CCT using a NC:C ratio of 1.7 in enddiastole with an excellent accuracy. There is an excellent correlation between TTE and CCT NC:C ratio. (Figure Presented) .",Excluded,0.17032619

711,1949,"Iodine-131 treatment and chromosomal damage: in vivo dose-effect relationship Although it is well known that radiation induces chromosomal aberrations, there is a lack of information on the in vivo dose-effect relationship in patients receiving iodine-131 treatment, and the results of previous studies are controversial. In this study, the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) method was employed to investigate acute and late chromosomal damage (CD) in the peripheral lymphocytes of 15 patients who received various doses of (131)I (259-3,700 MBq), either for thyrotoxicosis (TTX) or for ablation treatment in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). The SCE frequencies in cultured peripheral lymphocytes were determined before treatment (to assess basal SCE frequencies), on the 3rd day (to assess acute SCE frequencies) and 6 months later (to assess late SCE frequencies). The basal, acute and late SCE frequencies (mean+/-SD) were 3.19+/-0.93, 10.83+/-1.72 and 5.75+/-2.06, respectively, in the whole group, and these values differed significantly from each other ( P<0.001). In order to perform a quantitative evaluation of the present data and a comparative analysis with the results of previous studies reported in the literature, we defined acute and late effects using a ""damage ratio"" (DR) and a ""recovery ratio"" (RR), based on the basal, acute and late data for individual patients. No statistically significant difference was found in the DR between DTC and TTX patients (76.4%+/-11.5% vs 67.6%+/-9.0%), while the mean RR was higher in TTX patients than in the DTC group (75.2%+/-24.4% vs 36.8%+/-13.7%). The DR on the 3rd day was not related to the administered (131)I dose in the whole group, but a negative correlation was found between the (131)I dose and the RR at the 6th month (r=-0.60, P=0.04). The best fit for this relationship was obtained by a linear-quadratic model, as y=104.89x-28.4x(2)+38.1 ( R(2)=0.51, P=0.04). On the other hand, comparative analysis with the results of previous studies with comparable sampling times revealed that the best fit for the relationships between the administered dose of (131)I and DR and RR were obtained with a linear-quadratic model (Y=alpha D+beta D(2)) rather than a linear one. However, there was an interesting difference in comparison with in vitro studies, in that we found the coefficient beta to have a negative value, suggesting the disappearance of damaged lymphocytes from the peripheral circulation in a dose-dependent manner following (131)I treatment. Further studies are therefore needed to clarify the effect of the negative beta value on the biological dosimetry approach in continuous internal low LET radiation, as in the case of (131)I treatment.",Excluded,0.4761552

Patients and Methods: A total of 26 patients were included in this study. The study was designed as a ""split-mouth"" experiment. We performed scaling and root planing in the right maxillary quadrant, scaling and root planning + Er,Cr:YSGG laser in the left maxillary quadrant, scaling and root planning + 940 +/- 15-nm diode laser in the left mandibular quadrant, and only scaling and root planing in the right mandibular quadrant. The presence of human beta-defensin-1 and IL-1beta was analyzed with an ELISA. Result(s): When the baseline and post-treatment human beta-defensin-1 levels and IL-1beta levels of the study groups were evaluated, a decrease in human beta-defensin-1 and IL-1beta were observed in the quadrant where the Er,Cr:YSGG laser was applied in both the generalized aggressive periodontitis group and the chronic periodontitis group. Conclusion(s): The use of the Er,Cr:YSGG laser at non-surgical periodontal treatment decreased both IL-1beta and human beta-defensin-1 levels.

Nine patients required hospitalization, and 1 patient died., METHODS: To investigate the outbreak, pneumonia case patients were matched to control participants on the basis of age, sex, and community of residence. Participants in the investigation and their household contacts were interviewed, and serum samples and respiratory tract specimens were collected. Risk factors were evaluated by means of conditional logistic regression., RESULTS: Among 32 pneumonia case patients, 21 (65%) had confirmed or probable HAdV-14 infection. None of 32 matched control participants had evidence of HAdV-14 infection (P<.001 for the difference). Factors independently associated with pneumonia included contact with a known HAdV-14-infected case patient (odds ratio [OR], 18.3 [95% confidence interval {CI}, >or=2.0]), current smoking (OR, 6.7 [95% CI, >or=0.9]), and having neither traveled off the island nor attended a large public gathering (OR, 14.7 [95% CI, >or=2.0]). Fourteen (67%) of 21 HAdV-14-positive case patients belonged to a single network of people who socialized and often smoked together and infrequently traveled off the island. HAdV-14 infection occurred in 43% of case-patient household contacts, compared with 5% of control-participant household contacts (P = .005)., CONCLUSIONS: During a community outbreak in Alaska, HAdV-14 appeared to have spread mostly among close contacts and not widely in the community.

718,1956,"Electrical isolation of pulmonary veins in patients with atrial fibrillation: Reduction of fluoroscopy exposure and procedure duration by the use of a non-fluoroscopic navigation system (NavX) Aims: The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of performing segmental pulmonary vein (PV) isolation guided by the NavX (Endocardial Solutions, St Jude Medical, Inc., St Paul, MN, USA) system without the three-dimensional (3D) geometric reconstruction option and whether the use of NavX system will reduce the radiation exposure and procedure duration. Methods and Results: The study included 64 patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or permanent atrial fibrillation, in whom PV isolation was performed using fluoroscopic guidance (n=32) or the NavX system (n=32). Pulmonary vein mapping with a circular mapping catheter allowed the identification and localization of myocardial connections between the PV and the left atrium. PV isolation was performed by radiofrequency ablation of these connections at the atrial aspect of the PV ostium. Primary success rate for isolated PVs did not differ significantly in patients ablated under fluoroscopic guidance vs. those ablated under guidance of NavX system [100/107 PVs (93.5%) vs. 120/124 PV (96.8%; P=n.s.)]. Compared with fluoroscopy guided procedures, NavX-guided procedures showed a significant reduction in the fluoroscopy time (75.8+/-24.5 vs. 38.9+/-19.3 min, P<0.05), total X-ray exposure (93.2+/-51.6 vs. 56.6+/-37.9 Gy cm2, P=0.03), and total procedural time (237.7+/-65.4 vs. 188.6+/-62.7, P=0.01). The mean follow-up was 9.5+/-3.0 months. One patient in each group was lost to follow-up. Seven-day Holter monitoring showed that 23 of 31 patients (74.2%) in the NavX-guided group and 21 of 31 patients (67.7%) in the fluoroscopy-guided group were in sinus rhythm (P=0.57). Conclusion(s): The 3D visualization of the catheters by NavX system allows a rapid and precise visualization of the mapping and ablation catheters at the PV ostia and markedly reduces fluoroscopy time, total X-ray exposure, and procedural duration during PV isolation compared with ablation performed under fluoroscopy guidance. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",Excluded,0.17326438

Treatment was delivered with the CyberknifeTM or TrilogyTM radiosurgical systems. The median age of patients was 62 (range: 28-89). Primary pathologies included 14 lung, 7 breast, 4 colon and 11 others. Sixteen patients (44%) had received whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) prior to SRT/SRS; ten had received prior SRT/SRS at a different site (28%). The median tumor volume was 0.94 cm3 (range: 0.01-4.2) with a median prescription dose of 17 Gy (range: 12-24) delivered in 1-5 fractions. Result(s): Median follow-up for the cohort was 3.2 months (range: 0.4-20.6). Nineteen patients (52%) had an MRI follow-up available for review. Of these, one patient experienced local failure corresponding to an actuarial 6-month local control of 93%. Fifteen of the patients with available follow-up imaging (79%) experienced intracranial failure outside of the treatment volume. The median time to distant intracranial failure was 2.1 months. Six of the 15 patients with distant intracranial failure (40%) had received previous WBRT. The actuarial overall survival rates at 6- and 12-months were 27% and 8%, respectively. Predictors of survival included Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) score, greater number of treatment fractions, and higher prescription dose. Three patients experienced acute treatment-related toxicity consisting of nausea (n = 1) and headaches (n = 2) that resolved with a short-course of dexamethasone. Conclusion(s): SRT/SRS for brainstem metastases is safe and achieves a high rate of local control. We found higher GPA as well as greater number of treatment fractions and higher prescription dose to be correlated with improved overall survival. Despite this approach, prognosis remains poor and distant intracranial control remains an issue, even in patients previously treated with WBRT. © 2012 Leeman et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded,0.17157297
724,1962,"Comparison of phototherapy two times and four times a week with low doses of narrow-band ultraviolet B in Asian patients with psoriasis Background/Aims: The optimum narrow-band (TL-01) ultraviolet (UV) B weekly treatment frequency for psoriasis has yet to be defined, especially in Asian patients with TL-01. Our purpose was to compare 2x weekly and 4x weekly therapy with narrow-band UVB at low doses for psoriasis vulgaris. Method(s): Sixty-nine patients with moderately severe psoriasis were recruited and allocated to the 2x weekly or 4x weekly treatment group. The patients were treated with a new protocol using low doses of narrow-band UVB with varied exposure increments. Outcomes were evaluated by means of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores, time (weeks), cumulative UVB dose and number of treatments to clearance. Result(s): No significant difference was found between the two regimens in the PASI score at the end of treatment, in the proportion of patients whose skin cleared during treatment and in the time to clearance (8 weeks). Those who completed treatment achieved clearance after a median of 16 exposures with 2x weekly treatment compared with 32 exposures with 4x weekly treatment (P=0.0304), and 12.5 minimal erythema dose multiples (MEDs) compared with 39.7 MEDs (P=0.0470). Acute side effects of the treatment were similar for the two groups (P=0.8462). Conclusion(s): For skin phototype III-V populations, a greater long-term risk is expected, connected with the higher cumulative UVB dose and number of exposures required in the 4x weekly group. Therefore, 4x weekly phototherapy will no longer be used for psoriasis.",Excluded,0.17203003

728,1966,"Should hospitals protect from geopathogenic zones? The belief that geopathogenic zones exist and could cause morbidity is widespread. It is increasing even among physicians. Presently, in health care it is going to even gain an economical dimension by causing investment costs for claimed protective means and by influencing hospital planning, design and management. Therefore, this issue is no longer just a private borderline issue but has become publicly relevant. In view of the fact that relevant studies are lacking, it deserves scientific clarification. In a double-blind study this hypothesis was tested by two different approaches: First, it was investigated whether location-bound biologic effects could be identified at all. To remain independent from dowsers, an investigation area of 35 m(2) was chosen which was large enough to ensure the presence of at least one postulated adverse zone. This area was scanned in 0.5 m intervals by monitoring bioparameters such as skin resistance, reaction time and heart rate variability in 43 volunteers. Skeptics were excluded. Location-dependent changes were investigated by point-by point analysis of local data distributions and by analysing the two-dimensional spatial distributions of the measured bioparameters by cross-correlation analysis. In a second approach, 5 independent experienced dowsers were asked to locate geopathogenic zones within the area both to verify the adequate choice of the area and to correlate the pattern of dowser's scorings with the patterns of biosignal distributions. Neither of these approaches showed statistical significant differences. The investigation did not confirm the hypothesis that local geopathogenic zones existed and, hence, would need protective actions.",Excluded,0.18124731
729,1967,"Determination of solar ultraviolet dose in the Dead Sea treatment of psoriasis BACKGROUND: An increased risk of developing cancer of the skin is the only potentially serious (albeit unproven) long-term side effect of heliotherapy and it is therefore prudent to avoid unnecessary exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation. Traditional heliotherapy for psoriasis at the Dead Sea calls for a sun exposure of 5-6 hours daily for 28 days. Studies have determined that mid-summer exposure for 3 hours is equally effective., OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of 3 hours sun exposure daily in the heliotherapy of psoriasis at the Dead Sea during the months March to December; and to monitor the associated ambient doses of solar UVB radiation., METHODS: A total of 194 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis was treated in the months of March to December by 3 hours of sun exposure each day. The dose of ambient solar UVB was monitored by a Solar Model 501A UVB-Biometer., RESULTS: Three hours of sun exposure daily was therapeutically efficacious in all months from March to November, but not in December. The lowest effective cumulative UVB dose was 170 SED (standard erythema dose), recorded in March and November., CONCLUSIONS: Daily sun exposure for the heliotherapy of psoriasis at the Dead Sea can be reduced to at least 3 hours daily, about half the time originally recommended.",Excluded,0.17137954

735,1973,"Independent roles of calcium and voltage-dependent potassium currents in controlling spike frequency adaptation in lateral amygdala pyramidal neurons The calcium-dependent afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that follows trains of action potentials is responsible for controlling action potential firing patterns in many neuronal cell types. We have previously shown that the slow AHP contributes to spike frequency adaptation in pyramidal neurons in the rat lateral amygdala. In addition, a dendritic voltage-gated potassium current mediated by Kv1.2-containing channels also suppresses action potential firing in these neurons. In this paper we show that this voltage-gated potassium current and the slow AHP act together to control spike frequency adaptation in lateral amygdala pyramidal neurons. The two currents have similar effects on action potential number when firing is evoked either by depolarizing current injections or by synaptic stimulation. However, they differ in their control of firing frequency, with the voltage-gated potassium current but not the slow AHP determining the initial frequency of action potential firing. This dual mechanism of controlling firing patterns is unique to lateral amygdala neurons and is likely to contribute to the very low levels of firing seen in lateral amygdala neurons in vivo.",Excluded,0.20377216

CTPA was performed with vendor-predefined second-generation (group A, 100-kV single-energy computed tomography (SECT); group B, 80/Sn140-kV dual-energy computed tomography (DECT)) or third-generation DSCT (group C, 100-kV SECT; group D, 90/Sn150-kV DECT) devices. Radiation metrics were assessed using a normalized scan range of 27.5 cm. For objective image quality evaluation, dose-independent figure-of-merit (FOM) contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated. Subjective image analysis included ratings for overall image quality, reader confidence, and image artifacts using five-point Likert scales., RESULTS: Calculations of the effective dose (ED) of radiation for a normalized scan range of 27.5 cm showed nonsignificant differences between SECT and DECT acquisitions for each scanner generation (p >= 0.253). The mean effective radiation dose was lower for third-generation groups C (1.5 mSv +/- 0.8 mSv) and D (1.4 mSv +/- 0.7 mSv) compared to second-generation groups A (2.5 mSv +/- 0.9 mSv) and B (2.3 mSv +/- 0.6 mSv) (both p <= 0.013). FOM-CNR measurements were highest for group D. Qualitative image parameters of overall image quality, reader confidence, and image artifacts showed nonsignificant differences among the four groups (p >= 0.162)., CONCLUSIONS: Third-generation DSCT systems show lower radiation dose parameters for CTPA compared to second-generation DSCT. DECT can be performed with both scanner generations without radiation dose penalty or detrimental effects on image quality compared to SECT., KEY POINTS: * Radiation exposure showed nonsignificant differences between SECT and DECT for both DSCT scanner devices. * Dual-energy CTPA provides equivalent image quality compared to standard image acquisition. * Subjective image quality assessment was similar among the four study groups.",Excluded,0.17105378

Available treatments, among others, include pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, and injections of different substances into the muscle. Various methods have been used to confirm correct needle placement during these procedures, including electromyography (EMG), fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasonography (US) has now become a widely used technique and therefore may be an attractive alternative for needle guidance when injecting this muscle., OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the reliability of US in piriformis injection of patients with piriformis syndrome., STUDY DESIGN: Feasibility study; 10 patients with piriformis muscle syndrome were injected with botulinum toxin A using a US-guided procedure. Then patients were administered 2 mL iodinated contrast and were then transferred to the CT scanner, where they underwent pelvic and hip imaging to assess intramuscular distribution of the iodinated contrast., SETTING: Multidisciplinary Pain Management Department in Spain., RESULTS: Of all 10 study patients (8 women, 2 men), 9 had intramuscular or intrafascial contrast distribution. Distribution did not go deeper than the piriformis muscle in any of the patients. The absence of contrast (intravascular injection) was not observed in any case., LIMITATIONS: The main limitation of our study is the use of ionizing radiation as confirmation technique., CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided puncture may be a reliable and simple procedure for injection of the piriformis muscle, as long as good education and training are provided to the operator.

742,1980,"Diagnostic medical imaging radiation exposure and risk of development of solid and hematologic malignancy Limiting patients' exposure to ionizing radiation during diagnostic imaging is of concern to patients and clinicians. Large single-dose exposures and cumulative exposures to ionizing radiation have been associated with solid tumors and hematologic malignancy. Although these associations have been a driving force in minimizing patients' exposure, significant risks are found when diagnoses are missed and subsequent treatment is withheld. Therefore, based on epidemiologic data obtained after nuclear and occupational exposures, dose exposure limits have been estimated. A recent collaborative effort between the US Food and Drug Administration and the American College of Radiology has provided information and tools that patients and imaging professionals can use to avoid unnecessary ionizing radiation scans and ensure use of the lowest feasible radiation dose necessary for studies. Further collaboration, research, and development should focus on producing technological advances that minimize individual study exposures and duplicate studies.

Background(s): Nuclear medicine techniques have demonstrated global and focal cerebral perfusion abnormalities in patients with HIV dementia. Ultrafast pMRI enables the measurement of rCBF throughout the brain without the need to apply radioactive tracers or ionizing radiation. Method(s): pMRI was used to measure the rCBF in 19 patients with early stages of HIV-CMC and 15 healthy seronegative control subjects. The rCBF maps were registered to high-resolution anatomic MRI scans and transformed into Talairach space. Statistical analysis of the rCBF maps was performed with SPM96. Result(s): Compared with the control subjects, the patients with HIV had statistically significantly decreased rCBF bilaterally in the inferior lateral frontal cortices (right: -15%, p < 0.002; left: -12%, p < 0.005) and in the inferior medial parietal brain region (-15%, p < 0.0009). In contrast, rCBF was increased bilaterally in the posterior inferior parietal white matter (right: +19%, p < 0.0001; left: +17%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, rCBF abnormalities correlated significantly with clinical disease severity as measured by CD4 count, plasma viral load, Karnofsky score, and HIV dementia scale. Discussion(s): Our results are consistent with previous findings from PET and SPECT studies. Furthermore, pMRI can detect rCBF abnormalities that correlate with disease severity in HIV-CMC. Because pMRI is more cost-effective, faster, and safer than nuclear medicine techniques for monitoring rCBF changes, pMRI may be more feasible for monitoring the effects of therapy for HIV-CMC.",Excluded,0.17367147

(2) Methods: Bioptic and ablative procedures on bone lesions were retrospectively analyzed. All procedures were divided into SIRIO and Non-SIRIO groups and in <2 cm and >2 cm groups. Number of CT-scans, procedural time and patient's radiation dose were reported for each group. Diagnostic accuracy was obtained for bioptic procedures. (3) Results: One-hundred-ninety-three procedures were evaluated: 142 biopsies and 51 ablations. Seventy-four biopsy procedures were performed using SIRIO and 68 under standard CT-guidance; 27 ablative procedures were performed using SIRIO and 24 under standard CT-guidance. A statistically significant reduction in the number of CT-scans, procedural time and radiation dose was observed for percutaneous procedures performed using SIRIO, in both <2 cm and >2 cm groups. The greatest difference in all variables examined was found for procedures performed on lesions <2 cm. Higher diagnostic accuracy was found for all SIRIO-assisted biopsies. No major or minor complications occurred in any procedures. (4) Conclusion(s): The use of SIRIO significantly reduces the number of CT-scans, procedural time and patient's radiation dose in CT-guided percutaneous bone procedures, particularly for lesions <2 cm. An improvement in diagnostic accuracy was also achieved in SIRIO-assisted biopsies.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded,0.17253418

747,1985,"Optimized radioiodine therapy of Graves' disease: Analysis of the delivered dose and of other possible factors affecting outcome The best approach to radioiodine dose selection in the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism remains highly controversial. The formula to calculate the individual dose of 131I to be delivered has been used for half a century and takes into account the thyroid mass, the effective half- life and the maximum uptake of 131I. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of this formula by determining the relationship between the administered dose of 131I calculated to deliver a target dose of 50 Gy to the thyroid and the actual exact organ dose. We further analyzed if therapeutic success, defined by euthyroidism following the individually calculated dose, can be predicted by different pretreatment parameters and particularly by organ dose. One hundred patients with a first episode of Graves' disease and who had received optimal thyroid irradiation after precise dosimetry were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were categorized according to their thyroid function (plasma free thyroxine (T4) serum concentration) as eu-, hyper- or hypothyroid during and 1 year after treatment. The relationship between the administered dose and organ dose was assessed by simple regression. We compared free T4, free tri-iodothyronine, thyroid weight, the number of patients with antithyroperoxidase antibodies and TSH receptor autoantibodies. 24 h urinary iodine excretion, 131I uptake, and the exact dose of 131I delivered to the thyroid as pretreatment variables. Although we found a correlation between administered dose (mCi) and organ dose (Gy) (r = 0.3, P = 0.003), the mean coefficient of variation for organ dose was 45%. Individualized radioiodine therapy enabled euthyroidism in 26% of patients and failed in 74% of patients (33% had persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism and 41% permanent hypothyroidism). 131I uptake was significantly higher in the hyperthyroidism group in comparison with the euthyroid group. However, organ dose and other pretreatment variables did not differ among the three groups. In conclusion, these results confirm the low performance of individual dosimetry using what are established ratios, since the delivered dose to the gland, although correlated to the intended dose, is highly variable. The finding that other usual pretreatment variables are not different between groups, gives little hope for improving the way of calculating the ideal dose of radioiodine. We suggest to those not yet ready to give a standard or an ablative dose for Graves' hyperthyroidism that they abandon this way to calculate the 131I dose.",Excluded,0.17262053

749,1987,"Acute vasculitis after endovascular brachytherapy PURPOSE: Angioplasty effectively relieves coronary artery stenosis but is often followed by restenosis. Endovascular radiation (beta or gamma) at the time of angioplasty prevents restenosis in a large proportion of vessels in swine (short term) and humans (short and long term). Little information is available about the effects of this radiation exposure beyond the wall of the coronary arteries., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Samples were obtained from 76 minipigs in the course of several experiments designed to evaluate endovascular brachytherapy: 76 of 114 coronary arteries and 6 of 12 iliac arteries were exposed to endovascular radiation from 32P sources (35 Gy at 0.5 mm from the intima). Two-thirds of the vessels had angioplasty or stenting. The vessels were systematically examined either at 28 days or at 6 months after radiation., RESULTS: We found an unexpected lesion: acute necrotizing vasculitis in arterioles located < or =2.05 mm from the target artery. It was characterized by fibrinoid necrosis of the wall, often associated with lymphocytic exudates or thrombosis. Based on the review of perpendicular sections of tissue samples, the arterioles had received between 6 and 40 Gy. This arteriolar vasculitis occurred at 28 days in samples from 51% of irradiated coronary arteries and 100% of irradiated iliac arteries. By 6 months, the incidence of acute vasculitis decreased to 24% around the coronary arteries. However, at that time, healing vasculitis was evident, often with luminal narrowing, in 46% of samples. Vasculitis was not seen in any of 44 samples from unirradiated vessels (0%) and had no relation to angioplasty, stenting, or their sequelae. This radiation-associated vasculitis in the swine resembles the localized lymphocytic vasculitis that we have reported in tissues of humans exposed to external radiation. On the other hand, it is quite different from the various types of systemic vasculitis that occur in nonirradiated humans., CONCLUSION: Endoarterial brachytherapy using 32P results in vascular effects beyond the adventitia of the target vessel. This necrotizing vasculitis is causally related to radiation, but its mechanism is unclear and a dose effect is not evident. Quite possibly, local upregulation of inflammatory cytokines contributes to this radiation-associated vasculitis, which only involved some of the arterioles in each sample. It is likely that radiation-associated vasculitis also occurs around human coronary arteries and may result in foci of ischemia. To our knowledge, this lesion has not been previously recognized, either in experimental models or in human specimens examined after angioplasty/brachytherapy.",Excluded,0.96072096

No other predisposing factors for developing BCC were identified, such as immune suppression or a history of other malignancies. Histologic subtypes of all tumors were considered less aggressive, and only one tumor recurred., CONCLUSIONS: Axillary BCC is rare. Factors other than ultraviolet radiation likely contribute to the development of BCC, especially at sun-protected sites.

To the authors' knowledge, the question of whether RTOG-0129 overall survival (OS) estimates for low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups are similar in other data sets or applicable to progression-free survival (PFS) is unknown. Therefore, the authors evaluated whether survival differences between RTOG-0129 risk groups persist at 5 years, are reproducible in an independent clinical trial, and are applicable to PFS, and whether toxicities differ across risk groups. Method(s): Prospective randomized clinical trials were analyzed retrospectively. RTOG-0129 evaluated standard versus accelerated fractionation radiotherapy concurrent with cisplatin. RTOG-0522 compared the combination of cisplatin and accelerated fractionation with or without cetuximab. Patients with OPC with available p16 status and tobacco history were eligible. Result(s): There was a total of 260 patients and 287 patients, respectively, from RTOG-0129 and RTOG-0522, with median follow-ups for surviving patients of 7.9 years (range, 1.7-9.9 years) and 4.7 years (range, 0.1-7.0 years), respectively. Previous OS differences in RTOG-0129 persisted at 5 years. In RTOG-0522, the 5-year OS rates for the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups were 88.1%, 69.9%, and 45.1%, respectively (P for trend, <.001). The 5-year PFS rates for the same 3 groups were 72.9%, 56.1%, and 42.2%, respectively. In RTOG-0522 among a subgroup of patients considered to be at very good risk (p16-positive disease, smoking history of <=10 pack-years, and classified with T1-T2 disease with ipsilateral lymph nodes measuring <=6 cm or T3 disease without contralateral or >6 cm lymph nodes), the 5-year OS and PFS rates were 93.8% and 82.2%, respectively. Overall rates of acute and late toxicities were similar by risk group. Conclusion(s): RTOG-0129 risk groups persisted at 5 years and were reproducible in RTOG-0522. However, there was variability in the estimates.

Herein, the authors have reported to their knowledge the largest series to date using intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) in the treatment of these patients., METHODS: Between 2013 and 2018, a total of 86 consecutive patients (68 of whom were radiation-naive and 18 of whom were reirradiated) received PT to median doses of 70 grays and 67 grays relative biological effectiveness, respectively. Approximately 53% received IMPT., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 23.4 months (range, 1.7-69.3 months) for all patients and 28.1 months (range, 2.3-69.3 months) for surviving patients. The 2-year local control (LC), distant control, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 83%, 84%, 74%, and 81%, respectively, for radiation-naive patients and 77%, 80%, 54%, and 66%, respectively for reirradiated patients. Among radiation-naive patients, when compared with 3-dimensional conformal proton technique, IMPT significantly improved LC (91% vs 72%; P < .01) and independently predicted LC (hazard ratio, 0.14; P = .01). Sixteen radiation-naive patients (24%) experienced acute grade 3 toxicities; 4 (6%) experienced late grade 3 toxicities (osteoradionecrosis, vision loss, soft-tissue necrosis, and soft tissue fibrosis) (grading was performed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 5.0]). Slightly inferior LC was noted for patients undergoing reirradiation with higher complications: 11% experienced late grade 3 toxicities (facial pain and brain necrosis). Patients treated with reirradiation had more grade 1 to 2 radionecrosis than radiation-naive patients (brain: 33% vs 7% and osteoradionecrosis: 17% vs 3%)., CONCLUSIONS: PT achieved remarkable LC for patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancers with lower grade 3 toxicities relative to historical reports. IMPT has the potential to improve the therapeutic ratio in these malignancies and is worthy of further investigation. Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society.",Excluded,0.17367497

Most were married(62%)and 30% non-Caucasians.48% had ECOG PS 0-1,whereas it was 2, 3 and 4 in 24%,9% and 3%.Primary cancer diagnoses were lung (28%),breast(13%),prostate(10%),melanoma(10%),sarcoma(7%) and other diagnoses in 32%.Pain was predominant reason for consult(57%)followed by brain metastases(29%),spinal cord/cauda compression (13%),dyspnea (10%),bleeding (8%),bone fracture(4%)and dysphagia(2%).Clinicians managed pain (69%),neurologic symptoms(51%),fatigue (49%),intestinal(21%),respiratory (19%) symptoms,bleeding (14%),insomnia (13%),nausea/vomiting(12%)and dysphagia(6%).Patients presented at all stages 79% at the time of their diagnosis of metastatic cancer,63% with an established (> 1 month) metastatic cancer diagnosis and continuing to further cancer therapies and 17% proceeding to hospice care without further anti-cancer therapy after PRT. Conclusion(s): Radiation oncologists care for patients across time course of metastatic cancer diagnosis managing variety of urgent oncologic issues,most commonly metastases causing pain followed by brain metastases and cord compression.They also manage cancer-related symptoms,mostly pain,neurological symptoms and fatigue.These findings point to need for palliative care to be well integrated into radiation oncology practice including education and systems of care.",Excluded,0.17058288
767,2005,"Smoking, chromosomal aberrations, and cancer incidence in healthy subjects Chromosomal aberrations (CAs) in peripheral blood lymphocytes can be used as biomarkers of cancer risk. Cytogenetic tests were conducted on 2396 healthy Hungarian individuals and cancer incidence was followed up from 1989 to 2018. Venous blood samples were obtained from the subjects and metaphases from lymphocyte cultures were prepared. We compared the CA frequencies of the various smoking (1-5; 6-10; 11-19; or 20-40 cigarettes/day) and exposure (irradiation; chemical industry; chemical research laboratory) groups. Chromatid break (p = 0.0002), total aberration (p = 0.002), and aberrant cell (p = 0.001) frequencies were higher in smokers than in non-smokers. For very heavy smokers, total CAs were significantly higher than for non-smokers (<0.001) or less intensive smokers (p = 0.003-0.0006). Intensity of smoking was a predictor of chromosomal aberrations, while duration was not. During follow-up, 177 (7.3 %) cancer cases were found. A Cox-regression model showed that subjects with cell values >=2 CAs developed cancer more frequently (hazard ratio = 1.39; 95 % CI, 1.02-1.90). The relative risks of cancer were 1.06 (95 % CI 0.53-2.06) for light smokers and 1.74 (95 % CI 1.08-2.77) for very heavy smokers. The distributions of cancer sites showed differences between smoker and non-smoker groups: in male smokers, lung cancer, in non-smokers, prostate, and in females (both groups) breast cancer were most common. Cancer incidence correlated with chromosome aberrations; smoking was not a confounder in this relationship.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.783587

We postulated that irradiation and bone marrow transplantation might impact the development and progression of lung remodeling resulting from asbestos inhalation. Our objective was to determine whether irradiation and bone marrow transplantation affected inflammation and fibrosis associated with inhaled asbestos exposure. Inflammation, cytokine production, and fibrosis were assessed in lungs of naive and sex-mismatched chimeric mice exposed to asbestos for 3, 9, or 40 days. Potential engraftment of donor-derived cells in recipient lungs was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Compared with asbestos-exposed naive (nonchimeric) mice, chimeric mice exposed to asbestos for 3, 9, or 40 days demonstrated significant abrogation of acute increases in asbestos-associated inflammatory mediators and fibrosis. Donor-derived cells trafficked to lung but did not significantly engraft as phenotypic lung cells.

We postulated that this approach, for the same planned tissue dose of 120 Gy, would increase the embolic load, improve distribution, and result in enhanced tumor response without causing additional adverse events., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 2007 and September 2008, 50 patients with extensive tumor burden and/or markedly hypervascular tumors (13 hepatocellular carcinomas, and 37 liver metastases) underwent radioembolization with extended-shelf-life microspheres at a planned dose of 120 Gy. Baseline and follow-up imaging and laboratory data were obtained. Response in the target lesion was assessed with cross-sectional imaging by using World Health Organization (WHO) and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines., RESULTS: The mean delivered radiation dose was 126 Gy. The mean increase in embolic load with this approach was 111%, corresponding to an increase from 3.6 to 7.3 million microspheres. Clinical toxicities included fatigue (28 patients, 56%), abdominal pain (19 patients, 38%), and nausea/vomiting (six patients, 12%). Grade 3-4 bilirubin toxicity was seen in one patient. Two gastroduodenal ulcers were observed. With cross-sectional imaging, response rates according to WHO and EASL guidelines were 51% and 69%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of extended-shelf-life (90)Y glass microspheres. The increased embolic load and lowered activity per microsphere theoretically resulted in better tumor coverage and, hence, improved response rates.

778,2016,"Experience with wound complications after surgery for sacral tumors Purpose: The aim of this article is to summarize our experience in treating sacral wound complications after sacrectomy. We focus, in particular, on factors associated with wound complications, including surgical site infection (SSI) and wound dehiscence. Method(s): The definition of SSI devised by Horgan et al. was applied. Wound dehiscence was defined as a wound showing breakdown in the absence of clinical signs meeting the diagnostic standard for SSI. Between September 1997 and August 2009, 387 patients with a sacral tumor underwent sacrectomy performed by the same team of surgeons and were followed up for >=12 months. Potential risk factors were evaluated for univariate associations with SSI and wound complications. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to identify the combined effects of several risk factors. Result(s): Of the 387 wounds studied, 274 healed uneventfully, and 113 (29.2 %) broke down because of infection or dehiscence. Fifty-one (13.2 %) patients developed a postoperative SSI, and 62 (16.0 %) patients developed wound dehiscence. Gram-negative bacteria grew in 45 cultures (91.8 %) and included 38 cases of Escherichia coli. Previous radiation, rectum rupture, longer duration of surgery, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage were significantly associated with increased likelihood of developing an SSI. Previous radiation, rectum rupture, age <40 years, history of diabetes mellitus, maximum tumor diameter >=10 cm, and instrumentation used were risk factors for wound complications. Conclusion(s): The incidence of wound complications is not so high at a musculoskeletal tumor center with surgeons experienced in treating sacral tumors. Controlling for these risk factors when possible may improve clinical outcomes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded,0.172481

780,2018,"Identification of a novel three-column classification for double-column die-punch fractures of the distal radius The present study aimed to classify double-column die-punch fractures of the distal radius according to imaging data, and to evaluate their clinical features. A retrospective analysis of imaging data derived from 498 patients diagnosed with a double-column die-punch fracture of the distal radius was performed. The fractures were divided into those with middle-column avulsion with fracture of the radial-column articular surface (type I), those with middle-column collapse with fracture of the radial-column articular surface (type II), those with middle-column collapse with fracture of epiphysis of the radial column (type III) or mixed-type fractures (type IV). The intra- and inter-observer consistency between assessors was analyzed with kappa statistics. The patients with double-column die-punch fractures of the distal radius were followed up. There were 21 cases of type I fracture, 135 cases of type II fracture, 130 cases of type III fracture and 212 cases of type IV fracture. The intra-observer kappa coefficient ranged from 0.810-0.861, whereas the inter-observer kappa coefficient range was 0.830-0.876, with high consistency. Following 13 months of follow-up, the patients were assessed for functional recovery of the wrist and hand using the Gartland-Werley scoring system. The analysis indicated that in 95.78% of the patients, wrist function was rated as excellent or good (n=477), while in 4.22% of patients it was rated as fair (n=21), mainly due to the development of post-traumatic arthritis of the wrist following inappropriate therapy. All of the cases were type IV and type III fractures. These data demonstrated the application of a novel classification system named the Three-Column Classification, used to classify double-column die-punch fractures of the distal radius. This method reflected the mechanisms and severity of the fractures, conforming to the principle of AO fracture classification. Furthermore, it exhibited high consistency and may provide reference values for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognostic evaluation.Copyright © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

A three-dimensional model of thoracolumbar spine and simulative PVP models (via double transpedicular approach) were built in the Mimics software. With the help of a preoperative transparent marker located at the back midline skin and preoperative digital design by Mimics software, the needle insert point and needle direction in every patient were established. The surgical time, the number of intraoperative radiation perspective, bone cement filling condition in fracture vertebra, intraoperative complications and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores before and after surgery were recorded to evaluate the preliminary clinical results after modified PVP., RESULTS: The puncture process during PVP was in high accordance with the preoperative digital design by Mimics software in seven cases of single OVCF with the average age of 78 years old. The operation time was only 16.57+/-2.07 minutes and the intraoperative radiation perspective numbers were less than ten (7.86+/-1.68) times. The bone cement filling in all fracture vertebras were good and no surgical complications such as spine cord injury and cement leakage were founded. The VAS scores before and after surgery were 8.57+/-0.53 points and 1.43+/-0.53 point (P=0.000), respectively., CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) assisted by preoperative CT-based digital design has high accuracy, which is expected to reduce operation time, intraoperative radiation exposure and the surgical complications related to puncture failure.",Excluded,0.17314106
785,2023,"Assessment of real-world data surrogate for the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) OBJECTIVES: The 21stCentury Cures Act calls for the incorporation of real-world evidence (RWE) into the drug labeling process. Critics cite deficiencies of RWE as compared to randomized controlled trials (RCT). We aimed to assess whether subjectively reported best response to treatment differed from responses based on radiographic measurements of target lesions. METHOD(S): Electronic case report forms (eCRF) were fielded to assess clinical response to systemic therapy in a rare malignancy. A comparison of subjectively reported best response with radio-graphic measurements of target lesions was performed to assess responses. RESULT(S): Fifteen physicians with experience treating this malignancy participated in a CRF-based analysis of patterns of care. Treatment response for each line of therapy was collected for each of the 59 patients via CRF. For 9 patients (15%) with reported partial remission (PR), CRFs were augmented with bi-dimensional measurements of sentinel tumors from pre-treatment and best response radiographs (reports). Treatment response was calculated using sum of diameters according to RECIST and compared to the corresponding physician-reported response. Measurement-based response revealed 4 PR, 2 stable disease, and 3 progressive disease, and a concordance of 44.4% (95% CI: 15.3%, 77.4%) between response assessment methods. Reasons cited for variance include availability of previous scans for comparison, inconsistency in target lesions imaged, bone metastases difficult to follow, and use of diameter vs SUV (standardized uptake value) on positron emission topography (PET) scans. CONCLUSION(S): Subjective assessments of response collected via manual chart extraction, electronic medical record (EMR) review via natural language processing, or CRF may be problematic and limit the potential role of RWE in drug label expansion. The collection of target lesion measurements by CRF presents an attractive alternative to elevate the quality and accuracy of clinical response assessment in oncologic patients, but limitations exist.",Excluded,0.17154106
786,2024,"New recommendation and coverage of low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening: uptake has increased but is still low BACKGROUND: In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued recommendations for low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening (LDCT-LCS), but there continues to be a dearth of information on the adoption of LDCT-LCS in healthcare systems. Using a multilevel perspective, our study aims to assess referrals for LDCT-LCS and identify facilitators and barriers to adoption following recent policy changes. METHOD(S): A retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data from patients aged 55-80 years with no history of lung cancer who visited a primary care provider in a large healthcare system in California during 2010-2016 (1,572,538 patient years). Trends in documentation of smoking history, number of eligible patients, and lung cancer screening orders were assessed. Using Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models, we also evaluated provider-level and patient-level factors associated with lung cancer screening orders among 970 primary care providers and 12,801 eligible patients according to USPSTF guidelines between January 1st, 2014 and December 31st, 2016. RESULT(S): Documentation of smoking history to determine eligibility (59.2% in 2010 to 77.8% in 2016) and LDCT-LCS orders (0% in 2010 to 7.3% in 2016) have increased since USPSTF guidelines. Patient factors associated with increased likelihood of lung cancer screening orders include: younger patient age (78-80 vs. 55-64 years old: OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7), Asian race (vs. Non-Hispanic White: OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4), reported current smoking (vs. former smoker: OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.4-2.0), no severe comorbidity (severe vs. no major comorbidity: OR=0.2, 95% CI=0.1-0.3; moderate vs. no major comorbidity: OR=0.5; 95% CI=0.4-0.7), and making a visit to own primary care provider (vs. other primary care providers: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7-3.4). Appropriate referral for lung cancer screening varies considerably across primary care providers. Provider factors include being a female physician (vs. male: OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3) and receiving medical training in the US (foreign vs. US medical school graduates: OR=0.4, 95% CI=0.3-0.7).

792,2030,"Application of CareDose 4D combined with Karl 3D technology in the low dose computed tomography for the follow-up of COVID-19 BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus. Previous studies have shown that the chest CT examination plays an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19. However, some patients with COVID-19 had low white blood cell counts and reduced lymphocyte ratios. Multiple CT examinations may cause radiation damages as well as increase the apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. A new low-dose CT method should be developed because the regular CT may aggravate the disease. METHOD(S): Sixty cases were randomly divided into the study group (n=30) and control group (n=30). The lung window was reconstructed by Karl 3D iterative technique in the study group. The image quality was subjectively evaluated by two senior chest group diagnostic physicians using a 5-point double-blind method. The value of CT measurement and its standard deviation (SD) was used as an objective evaluation criteria. The volume of CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP) and effective dose (ED) from the two groups were compared and analyzed statistically. RESULT(S): There was no significant difference in the occurrence rates of ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, fiber cable shadow and axial interstitial thickening between the study group and control group (p >0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found for the subjective score of overall image quality and image noise level (SD) between the two groups (p > 0.05). However, significant differences was found in CTDIvol, DLP, and ED between the study group and the control group (p<0.05). The effective dose of the study group was reduced by 76% compared to the control group. CONCLUSION(S): CareDose 4D low-dose scanning combined with Karl 3D iterative reconstruction technology can not only greatly reduce the radiation dose, but also provide images that meet the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19, which can be used as a routine method for the follow-up of COVID-19 patients.",Excluded,0.17453907

799,2037,"GUCY2C signaling opposes the acute radiation-induced GI syndrome High doses of ionizing radiation induce acute damage to epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, mediating toxicities restricting the therapeutic efficacy of radiation in cancer and morbidity and mortality in nuclear disasters. No approved prophylaxis or therapy exists for these toxicities, in part reflecting an incomplete understanding of mechanisms contributing to the acute radiation-induced GI syndrome (RIGS). Guanylate cyclase C (GUCY2C) and its hormones guanylin and uroguanylin have recently emerged as one paracrine axis defending intestinal mucosal integrity against mutational, chemical, and inflammatory injury. Here, we reveal a role for the GUCY2C paracrine axis in compensatory mechanisms opposing RIGS. Eliminating GUCY2C signaling exacerbated RIGS, amplifying radiation-induced mortality, weight loss, mucosal bleeding, debilitation, and intestinal dysfunction. Durable expression of GUCY2C, guanylin, and uroguanylin mRNA and protein by intestinal epithelial cells was preserved following lethal irradiation inducing RIGS. Oral delivery of the heat-stable enterotoxin (ST), an exogenous GUCY2C ligand, opposed RIGS, a process requiring p53 activation mediated by dissociation from MDM2. In turn, p53 activation prevented cell death by selectively limiting mitotic catastrophe, but not apoptosis. These studies reveal a role for the GUCY2C paracrine hormone axis as a novel compensatory mechanism opposing RIGS, and they highlight the potential of oral GUCY2C agonists (Linzess; Trulance) to prevent and treat RIGS in cancer therapy and nuclear disasters.Copyright ©2017 AACR.",Excluded,0.43482906

803,2041,"Real-time optical image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of breast/chest wall cancer Purpose/Objective(s):We are developing real-time 3D/4D video guidance to reduce breast and chest wall setup errors and track target motion during post-mastectomy chest wall/nodal irradiation, breast only irradiation, and breast nodal irradiation in a clinical trial. We have also compared the reliability, accuracy, and precision of camera-based IGRT with results of weekly portal image verification and weekly CBCT volumetric matching. Materials/Methods: One-hundred forty patients, 102 breast only, 23 breast + nodal, and 15 chest wall + nodal, were accrued in an IRB-approved clinical trial of IGRT using 3D/4D optical images at daily setup and beamon time. Breast board and vacuum bag were used for all patients. Eleven patients with left-side diseases were treated under deep inspiration breath hold using ABC device and twenty-two patient using IMRT. Target shifts and rotations relating to CT-based planned reference surface were determined with real-time optical surface images using modified iterativeclosest-point alignment. A selected light ray intersecting the middle-upper abdominal surface and the anterior surface of the target projected onto the principal components were used as the real-time point/marker-based and surface/volume-based motion tracking, respectively. The optical guidance and real-time respiratory motion tracking were completely performed by therapists and results were semi-automatically saved in the camera-control computer. The target displacements (shifts and rotations) were compared with results of the weekly CBCT and portal images from EPID. Motion curves of surface Intersection point and surface principal components were also compared with breathing volume curves from the ABC system. Result(s): Daily target setup errors were reduced from 0.9 cm to <0.4 cm by using the 3D/4D video surface-guidance that was always consistent with results of portal images and CBCT if there were no big body motion during CBCT scanning. Higher accuracy and precision of 0.2 cm and longer stability without hardware change for clinical usage in four years were achieved for the video camera operated at the imaging speed and tracking rate of 15 frames per second. The novel intersection point and surface motion trackings were also more sensitive and accurate than that of commercial RPM and ABC systems. UP to 2 cm body sag on the slant breast board during longer IMRT treatments and surface deformation for five large breasts and some patients undertaken deep breath hold irradiation were detected. Conclusion(s): Accurate and precise optical image-guided setup of breast and chest wall targets was clinically validated with thousands of portal images and CBCT scans on 140 patients. More importantly, one can reliably track irregular target motion during daily dose delivery and detect gross target deformation during the entire course of treatment. The video guidance provides us all-time IGRT of breast and chest wall cancer without large volume low dose irradiation in taking daily CBCT and/or portal images.",Excluded,0.171303
805,2043,"Effects of dual-energy CT with non-linear blending on abdominal CT angiography Objective: To determine whether non-linear blending technique for arterial-phase dual-energy abdominal CT angiography (CTA) could improve image quality compared to the linear blending technique and conventional 120 kVp imaging. Material(s) and Method(s): This study included 118 patients who had accepted dual-energy abdominal CTA in the arterial phase. They were assigned to Sn140/80 kVp protocol (protocol A, n = 40) if body mass index (BMI) < 25 or Sn140/100 kVp protocol (protocol B, n = 41) if BMI >= 25. Non-linear blending images and linear blending images with a weighting factor of 0.5 in each protocol were generated and compared with the conventional 120 kVp images (protocol C, n = 37). The abdominal vascular enhancements, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and radiation dose were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance test, independent t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis test. Result(s): Mean vascular attenuation, CNR, SNR and subjective image quality score for the non-linear blending images in each protocol were all higher compared to the corresponding linear blending images and 120 kVp images (p values ranging from < 0.001 to 0.007) except for when compared to non-linear blending images for protocol B and 120 kVp images in CNR and SNR. No significant differences were found in image noise among the three kinds of images and the same kind of images in different protocols, but the lowest radiation dose was shown in protocol A. Conclusion(s): Non-linear blending technique of dual-energy CT can improve the image quality of arterial-phase abdominal CTA, especially with the Sn140/80 kVp scanning.",Excluded,0.17223191
806,2044,"Use of radiomics combined with machine learning method in the recurrence patterns after intensity-modulated radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A preliminary study Objective: To analyze the recurrence patterns and reasons in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and to investigate the feasibility of radiomics for analysis of radioresistance. Method(s): We analyzed 306 NPC patients treated with IMRT from Jul-2009 to Aug-2016, 20 of whom developed with recurrence. For the NPCs with recurrence, CT, MR, or PET/CT images of recurrent disease were registered with the primary planning CT for dosimetry analysis. The recurrences were defined as in-field, marginal or out-of-field, according to dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the recurrence volume. To explore the predictive power of radiomics for NPCs with in-field recurrences (NPC-IFR), 16 NPCs with non-progression disease (NPC-NPD) were used for comparison. For these NPC-IFRs and NPC-NPDs, 1117 radiomic features were quantified from the tumor region using pretreatment spectral attenuated inversion-recovery T2-weighted (SPAIR T2W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was calculated to identify influential feature subset. Kruskal-Wallis test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were employed to assess the capability of each feature on NPC-IFR prediction. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for feature reduction. Artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) models were trained and validated by using stratified 10-fold cross validation. Result(s): The median follow up was 26.5 (range 8-65) months. 9/20 (45%) occurred in the primary tumor, 8/20 (40%) occurred in regional lymph nodes, and 3/20 (15%) patients developed a primary and regional failure. Dosimetric and target volume analysis of the recurrence indicated that there were 18 in-field, and 1 marginal as well as 1 out-of-field recurrence. With pre-therapeutic SPAIR T2W MRI images available, 11 NPC-IFRs (11 of 18 NPC-IFRs who had available pre-therapeutic MRI) and 16 NPC-NPDs were subsequently employed for radiomic analysis. Results showed that NPC-IFRs vs. NPC-NPDs could be differentiated by 8 features (AUCs: 0.727-0.835). The classification models showed potential in prediction of NPC-IFR with higher accuracies (ANN: 0.812, KNN: 0.775, SVM: 0.732). Conclusion(s): In-field and high-dose region relapse were the main recurrence patterns which may be due to the radioresistance. After integration in the clinical workflow, radiomic analysis can be served as imaging biomarkers to facilitate early salvage for NPC patients who are at risk of in-field recurrence.Copyright © 2018 Li, Wang, Hou, Yang, Ren, Gao, Meng, Wu, Liu, Liu and Yan.

Purpose(s): To assess the feasibility and reproducibility of 18F-FDG PET/MRI to characterize plaque burden, composition and inflammation in subclinical atherosclerosis. Method(s): A total of 938 asymptomatic participants with extensive atherosclerosis (age 48.0+/-4.3 years, 84% men) from the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study underwent 18F-FDG PET/MRI of the carotid arteries, aorta, and ilio-femoral arteries 30 min after 18F-FDG injection (FDG dose 293+/-10.5 MBq, radiation dose 5.6+/-0.2 mSv). Arterial FDG uptake was evaluated on co-registered PET/MRI images using target-to-background ratios (TBR). Atherosclerotic burden was evaluated on T1-weighted MR images (indexed wall volume) and plaque characterization on T1- and T2- weighted MR images (lipidic, fibrous, mixed). Reproducibilities of FDG uptake and atherosclerotic burden/ composition were quantified in 15 PESA participants using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), kappa and Bland & Altman analysis. Result(s): A total of 842 (89.7%) 18F-FDG PET/MRI studies were available for final analysis (5.9% of which were incomplete, mainly lacking carotid imaging). FDG circulation time was 106.0+/-14.9 min for the ilio-femoral PET and 133.0+/-19.5 min for the carotid-aortic PET. Plaque composition analysis showed a Kappa value of 0.57. ICC of multi-territorial TBR was excellent (0.98; 95% CI of 0.97-0.98). ICC of multi-territorial indexed wall volume was good (0.89; 95% CI of 0.84-0.93). Bland & Altman plots showed good agreement for all explored territories, with mostly narrow confidence intervals (Figure). Conclusion(s): Hybrid 18F-FDG PET/MRI of multi-territory subclinical atherosclerosis in a single setting is feasible and highly reproducible, as demonstrated in the largest cohort ever reported for vascular PET/MRI, allowing multiparametric characterization of plaque burden, composition and inflammation.

808,2046,"Preservation of laryngeal functions in surgical treatment of pyriform sinus carcinoma Conclusion: The tumor's grade, rather than the tumor's location, was related to the opportunity of preserving laryngeal functions in patients with pyriform sinus cancer. The survival rate decreased significantly with the increase of tumor grade or node grade. Preservation of laryngeal functions is a safe and promising method without compromising the survival rate of patients with pyriform sinus cancer. Objective(s): Surgical resection of pyriform sinus carcinoma has a profound influence on the preservation of laryngeal functions. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the surgical treatment of pyriform sinus carcinoma in the preservation of laryngeal functions without compromising the survival rate. Method(s): Two hundred and thirty patients with pyriform sinus cancer had been operated from March 1978 to December 2002. Of them, 158 cases had been operated with the preservation of laryngeal functions and 72 cases had been undergone total laryngectomy. In addition, 216 cases had received adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy. All cases were followed up for 6-12 months (mean 51 +/- 26) after surgery. The survival rate was calculated on the basis of Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the factors that influenced the survival rate of patients with and without preservation of laryngeal functions were analyzed with the log-rank test. Result(s): Laryngeal functions were preserved completely (speech, respiration, and deglutition) in 70.9% (112/158) cases, and partially (speech and deglutition) in 29.1% (46/158) cases. The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 75.4% and 59.0%, respectively, for the group with laryngeal function preservation, and 58.6% and 41.5%, respectively, for the group without preservation. There was no statistically significant difference in the survival rate between the two groups within the follow-up period (p > 0.05). Increase in the tumor grade resulted in a proportional decrease of patients with preservation of laryngeal function (p < 0.05). Increase in the tumor grade (p < 0.05) or node grade (p < 0.05) also led to significant decrease in the survival rate. The location of the primary lesions (the lateral wall or medial wall of the pyriform sinus) showed no significant influence on either the opportunity for preserving laryngeal functions (p > 0.05) or survival rate of patients (p > 0.05). © 2011 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded,0.17868407

811,2049,"Geometrical changes of parotid, submandibular, and thyroid glands during intensity modulated radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): Both the tumor and organs at risk (OARs) occurred considerable changes during the intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) course for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aims to analyze quantitatively the geometrical variations of the parotid, submandibular gland (SMG) and thyroid as three independent OARs throughout IMRT course. Materials/Methods: Twenty NPC patients received the definitive chemo-IMRT in 33 fractions within 6.5 week-long course. Each patient had a planning CT (pCT) and six weekly repeat CT (rCT) without enhanced contrast. Each rCT was rigidly registered to its pCT. The parotid, SMG and thyroid were manually delineated in the axial pCT and rCT imaging by a single radiation oncologist. When compared a contour in pCT with rCT, it was calculated the volume of each contour (V-pCT, V-rCT), the common volume (V-com) and the shortest perpendicular distance (SPD) between two contours. Each surface voxel of a contour in rCT has a SPD and the standard deviation (SD) of all the SPDs was calculated. Both the SPD and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) calculated as 2*V-com / (V-pCT + V-rCT) were used as the surrogate of the shape variations. The displacement of center of mass as the positional shift was calculated and the mean displacement, system and random error were statistically calculated. The difference of geometrical changes among six week, the left- and right- sided OAR was compared using one-way analysis of variance or Mann-Whitney U test. Result(s): The mean radiation dose of the parotid, SMG, thyroid gland were 32.12 >= 11.2 Gy, 25.46 >= 8.62 Gy, 18.89 >= 10.24 Gy, (mean >= standard deviation) respectively. And their mean and maximal volume reduction were 28.6% >= 14.6%, 26.6% >= 17.1%, 12.3% >= 11.3% and 40.6% >= 12.4%, 38.9%>=14.9%, 16.3%>=14.3%, respectively. For the parotid and SMG, the volume loss per treatment day decreased from 1.7%, 1.6% in the first week to 0.5%, 0.6% in the last week, and that of thyroid was of 0.4% - 0.5% after the 2nd week. The center of mass displacement of parotid gland shifted medially 2.0 mm - 2.6 mm, SMG and thyroid did medially 0.1 mm - 0.5 mm. In addition, the displacement in anterior-posterior and cranial-caudal direction were < 0.6 mm. The 3-demensional vector displacements of the parotid and SMG were 2.2mme 2.9mmand that of thyroid were 4.0mm- 4.3 mm. The DSCs of parotid, SMGand thyroid showed the decreased time-trend. For the parotid, SMG, thyroid, the SD of SPDs increased from 1.5 mm e 1.8 mm in the first week to 2.1mme2.5 mm. The variations among the different weeks were statistically different (P < 0.05) and there was no difference between the left- and right-sided OARs (P> 0.05). Conclusion(s): For NPC, the volume, position and shape of parotid, SMG, thyroid occurred in quantifiable variations and these geometrical changes have their time-trend, which suggests the necessity of re-planning for the further sparing of OAR further during IMRT.",Excluded,0.17267974
814,2052,"Resource use in intensive care unit: A cost analysis in surgical intensive care medicine Background: Since 2004 surgical procedures done in German hospitals have been paid for by a flat-rate reimbursement scheme based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). The aim of the present detailed cost analysis study was to identify the major factors that determine the costs of intensive care medicine. Method(s): In a patient-based investigation lasting 6 months, 104 patients (mean age 64.6 years) on an interdisciplinary surgical intensive care unit were analyzed over 309 hospital occupancy days. Demographic data, drugs administered, infusions, nutrition, blood and coagulation products, invasive measures and monitoring, artificial respiration parameters, other measures and diagnostic services (laboratory, microbiology, x-ray, etc.), as well as four intensive scores (SAPS II, APACHE II, SOFA, TISS 28) were recorded daily. Result(s): The overall cost of 309 occupancy days (n=104) amounted to 457,564.11 euros, the average cost per day being 1,480.78 euros, and the mean case-specific cost 4,747.48 euros. 49 % of the overall cost was generated by medical staff, with medication and material each accounting for 18 %. Of the personnel costs, 70 % were caused by the nursing staff, 22 % by the medical staff and 8 % by cleaning and other personnel. During the course of hospitalisation, an non-significant increase in the costs generated by personnel was observed. A linear correlation was found between cumulated TISS 28 and the mean case costs. While there was no significant relationship between patient-specific score levels and individual case cost, the correlation between length of stay (LOS) and case cost was highly significant. Conclusion(s): The determining factor in the cost calculation of intensive care medicine are personnel costs. Overall cost is determined largely by the LOS, with such additional factors as age, diagnosis, comorbidity, etc. playing only an insignificant role. © Anasth Intensivmed 2010.",Excluded,0.17285268
816,2054,"Clinical outcomes of graves' ophthalmopathy treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy BACKGROUND: Radiation for Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) has traditionally utilized lateral opposing fields (LOF) or three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) technique. The current study was conducted to report clinical outcomes and therapeutic effects of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in treating GO patients., METHODS: One hundred sixteen patients with GO were treated with IMRT as initial local therapy between July 2010 and August 2013, with a median follow-up of 62 months (range 45-81 months). Radiotherapy dose was 20 Gy in 10 fractions within two to three weeks. The immediate and long-term response to IMRT was evaluated in GO severity score and in each category of symptoms. Acute and long-term complications were recorded to assess its safety., RESULTS: Symptom severity score significantly fell from the start of treatment to 4- or 6- month post-IMRT (P < 0.01). In total, 85 patients (73.3%) experienced improvement of GO symptoms in the first half-year, and only 4 of them (4.7%) suffered recurrence of the GO symptoms during the subsequent follow-ups. Orbital pain, tearing and extraocular muscle dysfunction had the best treatment reaction to IMRT, while proptosis and blurred vision were the most refractory symptoms. Acute complications were slight and self-limited, mainly including intermittent eye redness in 9 patients (7.8%), sideburns hair loss in 19 patients (16.4%), increased milphosis or madarosis in 23 patients (19.8%) and pseudo-progression of GO symptoms in 15 patients (12.9%). For long-term complications, chronic xerophthalmias occurred in 7 patients (6.03%), cataract developed in 2 patients (1.72%), and all were well-managed by medical interventions. Radiation retinopathy and secondary malignancy was not presented in the cohort., CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that IMRT could serve as a viable option in treating GO patients, with a satisfactory symptom control ability, and relatively slight and acceptable post-radiotherapeutic complications.",Excluded,0.17795958

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the correlation between insertion torque (IT) and resonance frequency analysis (RFA) of implants placed in mandibles and maxillas of different bone densities. Eighty dental implants were placed in maxillas and mandibles, and IT and the implant stability quotient (ISQ) were measured at the time of implant insertion. Bone density was assessed subjectively by the Lekholm and Zarb index. The type I and II densities were grouped together (group A)as were the type III and IV densities (group B). The IT in group A was higher (Student t test, P = .0013) than in group B (46.27 +/- 18.51 Ncm, 33.62 +/- 14.74 Ncm, respectively). The implants placed in group A showed higher ISQ (Student t test, P = .0004) than those placed in group B (70.09 +/- 7.50, 63.66 +/- 8.00, respectively). A significant correlation between IT and the ISQ value was observed for group A (Pearson correlation test; r = 0.35; P = .0213) and for group B (r = 0.37; P = .0224).

827,2065,"Correlation between hallux valgus angle and hallucal sesamoid position on meary radiographic incide Background: Hallux valgus (HV) and sesamoid misalignment are usually linked. Some studies found no correlation between the stage of hallucal sesamoid subluxation and standard radiographic data usually used for quantifying the severity of the HV. Aim(s): This study evaluate the correlation between the apparent lateral deviation of the sesamoids on anteroposterior X-rays and their rotation on axial X-rays, then evaluates their relations with the severity of hallux valgus. Method(s): This monocentric retrospective study included feet of adult men and women with a HV angle (HVA) superior to 15 degrees. Two independent doctors made the measurement of the relative displacement of the sesamoids on anteroposterior radiographies by using the 7 grades Clapham-and-Hardy classification and compared it with their rotation in axial radiographies, defined by the sesamoid rotation angle and the tibia sesamoid grade on modified Meary incidence with radio-transparent heelpiece. Correlation with the HV severity was analyzed based on measure of HVA and first intermetatarsal angle. Result(s): 303 feet were included (201 patients). All parameters shown significant correlations between each other. SRA appeared to be the most reliable criteria on Me ary radiography to evaluate the relative lateral displacement of sesamoids and it was the most strongly correlated to the HVA (0.658). Conclusion(s): An anteroposterior radiographic incidence is not sufficient to evaluate sesamoids subluxation. To approach at best the triplanar deformity of the metatarso-sesamoid complex, an evaluation in frontal and axial incidence is necessary.

We evaluated the QoL in these groups of patients. Patients and Methods: Forty-eight patients were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal cohort single-center trial to undergo SEMS positioning. Twenty-five patients had a CC and 23 RC. Karnofsky performance scale, Visual Analogue Scale and the EQ-5D- 5LTM questionnaire were administered before treatment and at 1, 3 and 6 months. Result(s): Harmonized to the Italian population, the index values showed a statistically significant deterioration of the QoL in patients with RC when compared to those with CC at 1-, 3- and 6-months (1 month: p=0.001; 3- month: p=0.001; 6-month: p=0.045). Similarly, Visual Analogue Scale showed variations at 1- (p=0.008), 3- (p=0.001) and 6-months (p=0.020). Rectal stent deployment was the only independent predictor for a worse QoL in all domains (p<0.017; OR=0.196; 95%CI=0.51- 0.749). Conclusion(s): Patients affected with stage IV CC had a better QoL after SEMS placement when compared to those affected with RC.

831,2069,"Treatment of symptomatic atrial tachycardia in complex anatomic conditions: Use and outcome of ablation in patients after damus-kaye-stansel surgery Background: Atrial tachycardias (AT) are amongst the most frequent complications in adult patients with congenital heart disease (ACHD). Their incidence mainly depends on age and complexity of underlying defect. AT has a marked impact on morbidity and mortality and is associated with sudden cardiac death particularly in complex ACHD patients. The arrhythmic substrate can be variable from re-entry to multifocal resulting in demanding requirements for electrophysiologic ablation procedures (EP) and thus, relatively high rates of recurrence. Methods and Results: Retrospective analysis of ACHD patients with prior Damus-Kaye-Stansel (DKS) surgery treated at one of the largest specialized tertiary centers for ACHD patients worldwide. Analysis focussed on occurrence of AT, respective treatment and outcome of EP. Over a median observation time of 15 years, 13 patients with prior DKS surgery and complex congenital heart defects of different types but uniformly Fontan circulation, were identified (median age 22.0 years (IQR 20.5 - 25.5), 76.9% male, 92.3% NYHA Class I, median systemic ventricular ejection fraction 58.5%, 69.2% extracardiac tunnel). Seven patients (53.8%) presented with symptomatic AT (median cyclic length 440 ms (IQR 360.0 - 517.5)). Of these, six patients underwent EP. Median procedure time was 180.5 min (IQR 160.8 - 274.5), median fluoroscopy time 1.56 min (IQR 0.51 - 4.73) and radiofrequency time 851 sec (265.0 -2005.0). Remote magnetic navigation was used to access ablation site through a retrograde access via the aortic as well as the neo-aortic valve. Three-dimensional image integration aided in mapping and ablation. Throughout the procedure as well as in follow-up visits, no reportable complications were observed. After a mean of 1.5 procedures, all analysed patients stayed complaint-free throughout a median time-interval of 13 months. Conclusion(s): AT are frequent in complex univentricular situations after Damus-Kaye-Stansel surgery (53.8%). Although more than one procedure (mean 1.5) was necessary to achieve satisfactory results even in experienced hands, EP appears to be an appropriate treatment strategy in this young and otherwise healthy patient cohort. According to our analysis, EP is feasible and safe in centers with knowledge of specific anatomic characteristics of congenital heart disease and when the appropriate technical infrastructure is present. Access to ablation site was performed by remote magnetic navigation in the majority of procedures. The floppy catheter was navigated through the neo-aortic as well as through the aortic valve without observable peri- or postinterventional complications. Mapping with three-dimensional image integration facilitated EP and led to a relatively low radiation exposure with the known benefits for the patient as well as for the healthcare professionals involved in the procedure.",Excluded,0.17099528
832,2070,"Dysfunctional Lens Index Serves as a Novel Surgery Decision-Maker for Age-Related Nuclear Cataracts Purpose: To study the correlations between subjective and objective cataract metrics with dysfunctional lens index. To investigate the potential of the DLI as a novel surgery decision-maker. Methods: In this prospective, cross-sectional study, we measured the dysfunctional lens index (DLI), Lens Opacities Classification System III nuclear opalescence (LOCS III NO) grading, preoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), objective scatter index (OSI) and Scheimpflug-based average lens density (ALD) in eyes with nuclear cataract. Eyes were classified as Surgical and Non-Surgical groups. Correlations among the DLI, OSI, ALD, LOCS III NO grading, and preoperative CDVA were analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for DLI, OSI, and CDVA to determine optimal cut-off values to separate between surgical and non-surgical cataracts. Results: The DLI showed the strongest correlation with the OSI (r= -0.712, P< .001), followed by LOCS III NO score (r= -0.661, P< .001), ALD (r= -0.596, P< .001) and preoperative CDVA (r= 0.563, P< .001). The area under ROC curves (AUCs) of the DLI, OSI and preoperative CDVA curve were 0.972, 0.912 and 0.844 (All P< .001), respectively. The DLI cut-off value of 5.7 implied higher levels of sensitivity (91.67%) and specificity (91.84%) than the OSI cut-off value of 2.9 and the CDVA cut-off value of 0.55 (sensitivity of 89.58% and 71.92%; specificity of 81.63% and 85.71%, respectively). Conclusion: The surgery criterion of DLI <= 5.7 behaved better than the surgery criterions of OSI >= 2.9 and preoperative CDVA <= 0.55 in discrimination between surgical and non-surgical nuclear cataracts.",Excluded,0.1733247
833,2071,"Assessment of successful incorporation of cages after cervical or lumbar intercorporal fusion with [(18)F]fluoride positron-emission tomography/computed tomography The purpose of this study is to assess the successful incorporation of cages in patients after cervical or lumbar intercorporal fusion with positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Twenty patients (14 female and 6 male; mean age 58 years, age range 38-73 years) with 30 cervical (n = 13) or lumbar (n = 17) intercorporal fusions were prospectively enrolled in this study. Time interval between last intercorporal intervention and PET/CT ranged from 2 to 116 months (mean 63; median 77 months). IRB approval was obtained for all patients, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. About 30 min prior to PET/CT scanning, 97-217 MBq (mean 161 MBq) 18F-fluoride were administered intravenously. Patients were imaged in supine position on a combined PET/CT system (Discovery RX/STE, 16/64 slice CT, GE Healthcare). 3D-PET emission data were acquired for 1.5 and 2 min/bed position, respectively, and reconstructed by a fully 3D iterative algorithm (VUE Point HD) using low-dose CT data for attenuation correction. A dedicated diagnostic thin-slice CT was optionally acquired covering the fused region. Areas of increased 18F-fluoride uptake around cages were determined by one double-board certified radiologist/nuclear physician and one board certified radiologist in consensus. In 12/20 (60%) patients, increased 18F-fluoride uptake around cages was observed. Of the 30 intercorporal fusions, 15 (50%) showed increased 18F-fluoride uptake. Median time between intervention and PET/CT examination in cages with increased uptake was 37 months (2-116 months), median time between intervention and PET/CT examination in those cages without increased uptake was 91 months (19-112 months), p (Wilcoxon) = 0.01 (one-sided). 14/29 (48%) cages with a time interval > 1 year between intervention and PET/CT scan showed an increased uptake. In conclusion, PET/CT frequently shows increased 18F-fluoride uptake in cervical and lumbar cages older than 1 year (up to almost 8 years in cervical cages and 10 years in lumbar cages) possibly indicating unsuccessful fusion due to increased stress/microinstability. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",Excluded,0.1715826
835,2073,"Neoadjuvant radiotherapy for rectal cancer: adherence to evidence-based guidelines in clinical practice Implementation of evidence-based standards is problematic. Level 1 evidence, largely predicated on the German Rectal Cancer Study, supports neoadjuvant treatment for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent this evidence has affected clinical practice. Stage II/III rectal cancer patients undergoing surgery from 1998 to 2007 were identified in the SEER tumor registry. Variables were analyzed with SPSS software. Trends were evaluated with regression models. Survivals were compared with the log-rank test. A total of 22,136 patients were identified and 15,021 (67.8%) were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy. A large percentage were >60 years old (64.4%), white (83.0%), male (58.8%), at stage III (55.1%), and treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy (35.5%). A significant increase in the use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy occurred: from 17% in 1998 to 51% in 2007 (p < 0.001). Scatter-plot best-fit lines for neoadjuvant and adjuvant radiotherapy intersected at approximately year 2002. Significant increases in preoperative radiotherapy were observed for all races and cancer stages (p < 0.001). On unadjusted analysis, race (p = 0.018), sex (p < 0.001), year of diagnosis (p < 0.001), age (p < 0.001), and stage (p < 0.001) were associated with increased likelihood of neoadjuvant radiotherapy. On logistic regression analysis, male sex [odds ratio (OR) 1.14, p < 0.001), year (OR 1.223, p < 0.001), and stage II (OR 1.39, p < 0.001) were predictors of neoadjuvant therapy. When adjuvant radiotherapy was utilized, there was rapid adoption of a neoadjuvant approach. This trend predated publication of prospective randomized data.",Excluded,0.18067959
836,2074,"The risk of cataractogenesis after gamma knife radiosurgery: a nationwide population based case-control study BACKGROUND: Medical radiation is considered a factor responsible for cataractogenesis. However, the incidence of this ophthalmologic complication resulting from gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has not yet been reported. The present study aimed to determine the risk of cataractogenesis associated with radiation exposure from GKRS., METHODS: This study used information from a random sample of one million persons enrolled in the nationally representative Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The GK group consisted of patients who underwent GKRS between 2000 and 2009. The non-GK group was composed of subjects who had never undergone GKRS, but who were matched with the case group for time of enrollment, age, sex, history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes., RESULTS: There were 277 patients in the GK group and 2770 matched subjects in the non-GK group. The GK group had a higher overall incidence of cataracts (10.11% vs. 7.26%; crude hazard ratio [cHR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.07-2.36; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.25; 95% CI, 0.82-1.90) than the non-GK group. Patients who had undergone computed tomography and/or cerebral angiography (CT/angio) studies had a higher risk of developing cataracts than those who did not (10.82% vs. 6.64%; cHR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.31-2.30; aHR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.22-2.23). The age group between 30 and 50 years had the highest risk of cataractogenesis in both the GK and CT/angio groups (cHR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.58-7.72; aHR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.02-5.81; cHR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.47-5.99; aHR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.05-4.93, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation exposure due to GKRS and CT/angio study may be independently associated with increased risk of cataractogenesis. We suggest routine dosimetry measurement of eye lens and proper protection for patients with benign lesions during GKRS. Regular follow-up imaging studies should avoid the use of CT/angio, and particular care should be taken in the 30-50-year-old age group, due to their significantly increased risk of cataract formation.",Included,0.73296356
837,2075,"Using remote sensing to predict outbreaks of Oestrus ovis in Namibia The Directorate of Veterinary Services of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Rural Development of Namibia issues warnings to farmers in the south of the country about the likelihood of infestation of small-stock by the nasal bot fly, Oestrus ovis. Farmers can then treat their stock at the most appropriate time. The O. ovis puparia develop at shallow depths in the soil and the timing of emergence is directly dependent on climate conditions, specifically the number of degree-days above a particular threshold soil temperature. Based on temperature measurements from only a few stations scattered throughout the country, the veterinary department warnings lack precision in space and time. This paper presents an attempt to support the programme of warnings with accumulated temperature information from Meteosat satellite images, in order to strengthen predictions of the time of emergence in specific places, and to improve the precision and reliability of warnings given to farmers.",Excluded,0.18278484
838,2076,"The lack of cytotoxic effect and radioadaptive response in splenocytes of mice exposed to low level internal beta-particle irradiation through tritiated drinking water in vivo Health effects of tritium, a beta-emitter and a by-product of the nuclear industry, is a subject of significant controversy. This mouse in vivo study was undertaken to monitor biological effects of low level tritium exposure. Mice were exposed to tritiated drinking water (HTO) at 10 KBq/L, 1 MBq/L and 20 MBq/L concentrations for one month. The treatment did not result in a significant increase of apoptosis in splenocytes. To examine if this low level tritium exposure alters radiosensitivity, the extracted splenocytes were challenged in vitro with 2 Gy gamma-radiation, and apoptotic responses at 1 and 24 h were measured. No alterations in the radiosensitivity were detected in cells from mice exposed to tritium compared to sham-treated mice. In contrast, low dose gamma-irradiation at 20 or 100 mGy, resulted in a significant increase in resistance to apoptotic cell death after 2 Gy irradiation; an indication of the radioadaptive response. Overall, our data suggest that low concentrations of tritium given to mice as HTO in drinking water do not exert cytotoxic effect in splenocytes, nor do they change cellular sensitivity to additional high dose gamma-radiation. The latter may be considered as the lack of a radioadaptive response, typically observed after low dose gamma-irradiation. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Included,0.95907223
839,2077,"[The impact of proton pump inhibitors on esophageal acid exposure in gastroesophageal reflux disease] OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) therapy on esophageal acid exposure of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and the correlation of anxiety and depression with recurrence of acid-related symptoms after discontinuation of PPIs., METHODS: From February 2010 to June 2011, 28 patients with GERD diagnosed by ambulatory 24 h esophageal pH monitoring admitted to Beijing Jishuitan Hospital were treated with esomeprazole 20 mg 2 times/d for 8 weeks (male 16, female 12). Symptoms after drug discontinuation were monitored. Ambulatory 24 h esophageal pH monitoring was performed on patients, whose symptom recurred within 8 weeks after treatment. BMI, Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were detected., RESULTS: Among the 28 patients with GERD, 15 (53.6%) recurred symptoms after withdraw of PPIs. Compared with the asymptomatic group after withdraw of PPIs, the pretreatment duration of pH 4 (supine), 24 h total acid reflux time, number of time periods with acid reflux > 5 minutes, the maximal acid reflux time and 24 h total number of acid reflux in the symptomatic recurrence group were statistically significantly increased (11.7% vs 4.5%, 138.8 minutes vs 62.1 minutes, 6.0 vs 2.0, 27.0 minutes vs 12.4 minutes, 74.0 times vs 43.0 times, respectively, all P values < 0.05). There were no significant differences in BMI, SAS and SDS between the two groups., CONCLUSIONS: The basic level of esophageal acid exposure of patients with GERD before PPIs therapy may influence the esophageal acid exposure after PPIs therapy and then may affect the recurrence of symptoms. Although anxiety and depression is common in patients with GERD, it is not found that the recurrence of acid-related symptoms after the discontinuation of PPIs therapy is related to the anxiety and depression.",Excluded,0.17720795

Method(s): A total of 82 patients (58 males and 24 females) with large hepatocellular carcinoma aged over 70 years (70 to 85 years, (75+/-4) years) with a median tumor diameter of 6.7 cm (5.0~10.0 cm) were retrospectively collected. All patients were diagnosed by pathology or radiography in the Cancer Radiotherapy Center of the Fifth Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital from March 2014 to December 2018, and treated with cyberknife stereotactic radiotherapy. Progression free survival rate (PFS), local control rate (LC), overall survival rate (OS) and adverse reactions were observed at 1, 2 and 3 years. Kaplan-Meier was used for survival analysis, and Cox regression model was used to analyze survival-related factors. Result(s): All 82 patients successfully completed radiation therapy with a median survival time of 20 months, a median PFS of 10 months, an objective response rate of 64.63% (53/82), and a disease control rate of 85.37% (70/82). After treatment, the PFS at 1, 2, and 3 years were 39.0% (32/82), 22.1% (18/82), and 17.1% (14/82), respectively; the LC at 1, 2, and 3 years were 95.1% (78/82), 92.3% (76/82), and 92.3% (76/82), respectively; and the OS at 1, 2, and 3 years were 68.3% (56/82), 48.8% (40/82) and 31.7% (26/82), respectively. Nine patients suffered from radiation-induced liver disease (RILD), and there were no deaths due to RILD. Cox regression analysis showed that alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was an independent risk factor for OS (HR=2.304, 95%CI 1.118-4.747;P<0.05).

Morphea is the most important differential diagnosis. This study was intended to identify clinical and pathologic features that can be used to distinguish FIRU from morphea., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on 25 specimens from 15 patients with FIRU and 21 specimens from 21 patients with morphea. Clinical findings and pathological features were analyzed., RESULTS: Thirteen of 15 patients (86.7 %) with FIRU underwent angioplasty for coronary artery disease, and eleven patients had lesions in the right subscapular area. Compared with morphea, FIRU patients were more likely to display non-inflammatory infiltrates (28 %), bizarre fibroblasts (100 %), sclerosis (48 %), telangiectasia (96 %), vascular damage (64 %), and loss of skin appendages (100 %). In morphea, bizarre fibroblasts were rare (14 %), while telangiectasia (62 %) and loss of skin appendages (62 %) were variable. Loss of CD34+ cells and compression of elastic fibers could not be used to distinguish between FIRU and morphea., CONCLUSIONS: Skin lesion in the right subscapular area with presence of bizarre fibroblasts, sclerosis, telangiectasia, and loss of cutaneous appendages as seen with histology are highly characteristic of the radiation damage associated with fluoroscopic angiography.

We assessed the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the anti-programmed cell death 1 fusion protein AMP-224 in combination with low-dose cyclophosphamide and stereotactic body radiation (SBRT) treatment in patients with mCRC refractory to standard chemotherapy. Patients and Methods: Fifteen patients were enrolled. Six received SBRT 8 Gy on day 0 (dose level 1), whereas 9 received 8 Gy on days -2 to day 0. All received cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 intravenously (I.V.) on day 0. On day 1, both groups received AMP-224 10 mg/kg I.V., repeated every 2 weeks for a total of 6 doses. Primary end points were feasibility and safety. Result(s): Ten (67%) patients completed 6 doses of AMP-224; 5 patients (33%) discontinued treatment because of disease progression. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed; 9 patients (60%) experienced treatment-related adverse events, all Grade 1 or 2. No objective response was noted; 3 patients (20%) had stable disease. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 2.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.8 months) and 6.0 months (95% CI, 2.8-9.6 months), respectively.

846,2084,"Management and long-term outcomes of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma: Twenty-year experience at a single institution Purpose/Objective(s): Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is a rare malignancy of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses generally associated with an aggressive clinical course and poor long-term survival. Optimal management is not well-defined, and varying combinations of surgery (S), radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy (CT) have been reported. There have been substantial advances in surgery as well as radiation therapy, which may offer improved outcomes. We review the management approaches, long-term outcomes, and patterns of failure of patients treated at our institution to help define the optimal management for this rare malignancy. Materials/Methods: Fifteen patients with SNUC were treated from 1992- 2012 at our institution, with pathology reviewed and confirmed. Demographic, treatment, and clinical data were collected from medical records. Patients underwent imaging evaluation with CT and/or MRI. Event outcomes were calculated from date of surgery to time of recurrence, death, or last follow-up. Survival statistics were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox Regression methods. Result(s): There were 10 male and 5 female patients with median age 49 years (range 22-82). Most patients had locally advanced T stage: T2 (n = 2), T3 (n = 5), and T4 (n = 8). At diagnosis, 1 patient was clinically node positive and none had distant metastases. Treatment was as follows: 4 S + postoperative RT +/- chemotherapy (CT); 3 preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) + S; 7 primary CRT; 1 RT alone. Nine had RT to primary site alone, and 6 had elective neck RT. Median dose was 69.5 Gy (range 50.4-70.2). Most received concurrent CT (n = 12). Median follow up was 39 months (range 3-206). At time of analysis, 8 patients are alive, 6 have died and 1 is lost to follow up. KM projected 5-year OS and RFS-rates were 70% and 53%, respectively. Five patients recurred: 1 local, 1 local/neck, 1 neck, 1 distant, 1 local/neck/distant. Median time to recurrence was 7 months. On univariate analysis, there was no statistically significant impact of stage, use of surgery, use of chemotherapy, radiation dose, gender, or age on survival. A trend for improved survival with concurrent CRT was seen (p = 0.097). Conclusion(s): SNUC is a highly aggressive malignancy associated with a high risk of disease recurrence, consistent with other series reported in the literature. There are some long term survivors who were treated with primary CRT or preoperative CRT followed by surgery. Early multimodality therapy is necessary for improved outcomes. The optimal timing and sequence of S, RT and CT should be further investigated.",Excluded,0.17167982
847,2085,"Changes in performance and bio-mathematical model performance predictions during 45 days of sleep restriction in a simulated space mission Lunar habitation and exploration of space beyond low-Earth orbit will require small crews to live in isolation and confinement while maintaining a high level of performance with limited support from mission control. Astronauts only achieve approximately 6 h of sleep per night, but few studies have linked sleep deficiency in space to performance impairment. We studied crewmembers over 45 days during a simulated space mission that included 5 h of sleep opportunity on weekdays and 8 h of sleep on weekends to characterize changes in performance on the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and subjective fatigue ratings. We further evaluated how well bio-mathematical models designed to predict performance changes due to sleep loss compared to objective performance. We studied 20 individuals during five missions and found that objective performance, but not subjective fatigue, declined from the beginning to the end of the mission. We found that bio-mathematical models were able to predict average changes across the mission but were less sensitive at predicting individual-level performance. Our findings suggest that sleep should be prioritized in lunar crews to minimize the potential for performance errors. Bio-mathematical models may be useful for aiding crews in schedule design but not for individual-level fitness-for-duty decisions.",Excluded,0.17608935

Thirty-one patients were treated with 188Re-HEDP (3194 +/- 387 MBq), 15 patients with 186Re-HEDP (1358 +/- 158 MBq), and 18 patients with 89Sr (152 +/- 19 MBq). The 188Re-HEDP group included six breast cancer patients and 25 prostate cancer patients; the 186Re-HEDP group included three breast cancer patients and 12 prostate cancer patients; and the 89Sr group included three breast cancer patients and 15 prostate cancer patients. All subjects participated in an interview using a standardized sets of questions before and after the 12-week term of therapy. Blood counts were taken weekly for six weeks and after 12 weeks. Results showed that 77 percent of patients reported pain relief after treatment with 188Re-HEDP, 67 percent after treatment with 186Re-HEDP, and 72 percent after treatment with 89Sr. Sixteen percent of patients treated with 188Re-HEDP, 13 percent treated with 186Re-HEDP, and 17 percent treated with 89Sr were able to discontinue their analgesics and were pain-free. Patients described an improvement on Karnofsky performance status (KPS) from 73 +/- 7 percent to 85 +/- 8 percent 12 weeks after 188Re-HEDP (p < 0. 05), from 72 +/- 13 percent to 79 +/- 12 percent after 186Re-HEDP (p = 0.251), and from 62 +/- 14 percent to 69 +/- 16 percent after 89Sr (p = 0.415). Only three patients undergoing 188Re-HEDP therapy, one undergoing 186Re-HEDP therapy, and three undergoing 89Sr therapy had thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 100 x 10(3)/microl) following treatment. The maximum nadir of platelet and leukocyte counts was observed between the second and fifth week after treatment for all radionuclides and was reversible within 12 weeks. The nadir was earlier for 188Re-HEDP with a shorter physical half-life compared with 89Sr. There were no significant differences in bone marrow toxicity (p = 0.123-0.421). Results of this study indicate that all evaluated radiopharmaceuticals were effective in pain palliation without induction of severe side effects. The increase in KPS after 188Re-HEDP was the only statistically significant finding (p = 0.001).",Excluded,0.17671773

854,2092,"Measuring femoral and rotational alignment: EOS system versus computed tomography Introduction: Computed tomography (CT) is currently the reference standard for measuring femoral and tibial rotational alignment. The EOS System is a new biplanar low-dose radiographic device that allows 3-dimensional lower-limb modelling with automated measurements of femoral and tibial rotational alignment (torsion). Hypothesis: Femoral and tibial torsion measurements provided by the EOS System are equivalent to those obtained using CT. Material(s) and Method(s): In a retrospective analysis of 43 lower limbs in 30 patients, three senior radiologists measured femoral and tibial torsion on both CT and EOS images. Agreement between CT and EOS values was assessed by computing Pearson's correlation coefficient and interobserver reproducibility by computing the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Result(s): Femoral torsion was 13.4degree by EOS vs. 13.7degree by CT ( P= 0.5) and tibial torsion was 30.8degree by EOS vs. 30.3degree by CT ( P= 0.4). Strong associations were found between EOS and CT values for both femoral torsion ( P= 0.93) and tibial torsion ( P= 0.89). With EOS, the ICC was 0.93 for femoral torsion and 0.86 for tibial torsion; corresponding values with CT were 0.90 and 0.92. Discussion(s): The EOS system is a valid alternative to CT for lower-limb torsion measurement. EOS imaging allows a comprehensive evaluation in all three planes while substantially decreasing patient radiation exposure. Level of Evidence: Level III, case-control. © 2013 .",Excluded,0.17157654
855,2093,"Simple quantification of paracardial and epicardial fat dimensions at low-dose chest CT: correlation with metabolic risk factors and usefulness in predicting metabolic syndrome Purpose: To assess the usefulness of simple axial bi-dimensional diameters of pericardial fat tissues at low-dose chest CT, in correlation with metabolic parameters in predicting metabolic syndrome. Material(s) and Method(s): Subjects were 373 asymptomatic individuals who performed both low-dose chest CT and abdominal fat CT for medical check-up. Maximum bi-dimensional axial diameters of paracardial fats at right (RPF) and left (LPF) cardiophrenic angle portions, and epicardial fats around right (REF) and left (LEF) coronary arteries, and coronary sinus (SEF) were measured. Correlation between pericardial fat diameters and metabolic parameters were statistically analyzed. Result(s): RPF, LPF, REF, LEF, and SEF diameters were moderately correlated with abdominal visceral fat (AVF) area (R = 0.74, 0.70, 0.48, 0.41, and 0.53, respectively, p < 0.01) in Pearson's correlation analysis. In multiple linear regression analysis, coefficient of RPF for AVF showed highest value. Means of each PF and EF diameters in subjects with metabolic syndrome were significantly larger than those without metabolic syndrome (p < 0.001). All PF and EF diameters were well-discriminated for prediction of metabolic syndrome in ROC analysis (AUC values, from 0.696 to 0.795). Conclusion(s): RPF diameter at low-dose chest CT would be a simple method for prediction of metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2018, Japan Radiological Society.",Excluded,0.17248619
858,2096,"Preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer causes prolonged pudendal nerve terminal motor latency PURPOSE: A worsened anorectal function after chemoradiation for high-risk rectal cancer is often attributed to radiation damage of the anorectum and pelvic floor. Its impact on pudendal nerve function is unclear. This prospective study evaluated the short-term effect of preoperative combined chemoradiation on anorectal physiologic and pudendal nerve function. METHOD(S): Sixty-six patients (39 men, 27 women) with localized resectable (T3, T4, or N1) rectal cancer were included in the study. All patients received 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/day in 25 fractions) over five weeks, plus 5-fluorouracil (350 mg/m2/day) and leucovorin (20 mg/m2/day) concurrently on days 1 to 5 and 29 to 33. Patients who had rectal cancer with a distal margin within 6 cm of the anal verge had the anus included in the field of radiotherapy (Group A, n = 26). Patients who had rectal cancer with a distal margin 6 to 12 cm from the anal verge had shielding of the anus during radiotherapy (Group B, n = 40). The Wexner continence score, anorectal manometry and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency were assessed at baseline and four weeks after completion of chemoradiation. RESULT(S): The median Wexner score deteriorated significantly (P < 0.0001) from 0 to 2.5 for both Groups A (range, 0-8) and B (range, 0-14). The maximum resting anal pressures were unchanged after chemoradiation. The maximum squeeze anal pressures were reduced (mean = 166.5-157.5 mmHg) after chemoradiation. This change was similar in both Groups A and B. Eighteen patients (Group A = 7, Group B = 11) developed prolonged pudendal nerve terminal motor latency after chemoradiation. These 18 patients similarly had a worsened median Wexner continence score (range, 0-3) and maximum squeeze anal pressures (mean = 165.5-144 mmHg). The results obtained were independent of tumor response to chemoradiation. CONCLUSION(S): Preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer carries a significant risk of pudendal neuropathy, which might contribute to the incidence of fecal incontinence after restorative proctectomy for rectal cancer. © The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons 2005.",Excluded,0.17396058
863,2101,"Assessment of inflammatory back pain and axial spondyloarthritis in Brazil Background/Purpose: The concept of inflammatory back pain (IBP) was proposed in association with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), one prototype of Spondyloarthritis (SpA), more than 60 years ago. Spondyloarthritis (SpA) comprises several rheumatic diseases. Although several criteria sets have been developed, the diagnosis of SpA remains challenging. This study aims to evaluate the frequency of inflammatory back pain (IBP) among Brazilian subjects with chronic back pain (CBP), and to describe the results of rheumatologic evaluation based on the axial SpA classification criteria from the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS). Method(s): This was an observational study with retrospective (phase 1) and one-month prospective (phase 2) data collection. Medical records of subjects 18-60 years old, with onset of back pain at age <40 years, and with CBP (pain almost daily >=3 months), were included in phase 1. Subjects with at least one ASAS screening parameter for IBP were contacted by phone, and confirmed IBP cases were invited to phase 2. At phase 2 visit 1, HLA-B27 and C-reactive protein (CRP) were requested. At phase 2 visit 2, the fulfilment of the ASAS classification criteria for axial SpA was verified. Frequency of IBP among subjects with CBP starting before the age of 40 years was estimated. For subjects included in phase 2, the proportions of positive HLA-B27, AS and non-radiographic axial SpA (nrAxSpA) were calculated. Result(s): A total of 363 records of subjects with CBP were reviewed from five sites. Based on medical records and phone contact, 130 subjects had IBP confirmed (35.8%, 95%CI: 30.9-40.7%). From IBP population, only 52 subjects accepted to participate in phase 2. Mean age was 38.8+/-11.43 years, 64% were female, 85% professionally active, and 14% had family history of IBP related conditions. Time since CBP onset was 12.3+/-10.09 years and no subject had a prior diagnosis of SpA. Among the 50 patients that completed visit 2, 14% had positive HLA-B27, 82% had lesions of the sacroiliac joint assessed by MRI, 16% had abnormal clinically significant CRP results, and 10% had grade 3-4 lesions assessed by X-ray. The proportions of AS and nrAxSpA cases were 46% and 26%, respectively by ASAS classification criteria. Conclusion(s): More than one third of the CBP subjects with onset <40 years had IBP by ASAS criteria. Of notice, subjects with a positive HLA-B27 test did not have prior diagnosis of axial SpA. The results in this Brazilian population suggest that patients with IBP may be under diagnosed, delaying their treatment, and that women may seek more for medical care than men. An eventual selection bias cannot be excluded.",Excluded,0.17237076
865,2103,"Evaluation of PRRT after selective catheterization of the hepatic artery as established technique ('Aretaieion' Protocol) using 111In-DTPA-Phe1 octreotide in inoperable liver metastases due to neuroendocrine tumors Aim/Introduction: To evaluate the efficacy of Auger and Internal Conversion Electron Emission of 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide and their tumoricidal effectiveness due to their high LET, in inoperable liver metastases, positive for sst2 receptor over-expression (verified by Octreoscan and confirmed by biopsy) due to neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). Material(s) and Method(s): In 86 patients 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide was implemented after selective catheterization of the hepatic artery, in an average activity of 6.3+/-1.3 GBq per patient/ per session, consecutively, with a time interval between sessions of 6-8 weeks. Infusion repetition did not exceed the 12 sessions. Patients, being under repeated Sandostatin-LAR treatment (30 mg per 20 days) did not discontinued the dosage but they were intramuscularly injected 15-20 days prior to the radioactive session. To reduce myelotoxicity, 75 mg of DTPA in trip-trop diluted in about 200 ml normal saline water was infused 30 min before the initialization of the radiopeptide therapy, lasting for about 4 hrs. For the assessment of response, RECIST 1.1 standards were used. CT/MRI scans before, during and after the end of the whole procedure, as well as U/S images at monthly basis were performed. Absorbed doses delivered to metastases, kidneys and red marrow were calculated according to OLINDA/EXM 1.1 program. Toxicity (World Health Organization criteria) was measured using blood and urine tests of renal, hepatic and bone marrow function. Result(s): Three patients resulted in complete response (3.5%); partial response was assessed in 46 (53.5 %), disease stabilization in 21 (24.4 %) and progressive disease in 16 (18.6%). The median PFS and OS were estimated to be 32 and 47.5 months, respectively. The organ average radiation dose was estimated as follows: (a) Liver Tumor 15.2 mGy/MBq, (b) Liver 0.14 mGy/MBq, (c) Kidneys 0.41 mGy/ MBq, (d) Spleen 1.4 mGy/MBq and (f ) Bone marrow 0.0032 mGy/MBq. The average absorbed dose per session to a tumour for a spherical mass of 10 gr was estimated to be 10.8 mGy/MBq, depending on the histotype of the tumour. WHO toxicity grade 2 to 3 erythro-, leuko-and thrombocytopenia occurred in 9 (10.5%) cases observed about after the 3rd session. Conclusion(s): In unresectable metastatic liver lesions, positive for somatostatin receptors, repeated, transhepatic high doses of 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide resulted in an optimal therapeutic outcome with a disease control (CR+PR+SD) in an about 82 % of the treated patients. Thus, 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide, intra-arterially applied, can be considered as a potent candidate in the therapeutic pharetra against NETs.",Excluded,0.17108846

868,2106,"Abdominal circumference but not the degree of lumbar flexion affects the accuracy of lumbar interspace identification by Tuffier's line palpation method: An observational study Background: Lumbar puncture for spinal or epidural anesthesia is commonly performed by palpating bony landmarks, but identification of the desired intervertebral level is often inaccurate. It is unclear whether such inaccuracy is related to patient factors, such as body mass index and degree of lumbar flexion. We hypothesized that overweight patients and patients with less of an ability to hyperflex their lumbar spines are prone to inaccurate lumbar spinous intervertebral level identification. Method(s): 52 adult volunteers were included in this study. 7 anesthesiologists with different years of experience identified and marked subjects' levels of the iliac crests, then marked the presumed interspaces. Lumbar X-ray was then performed with metal markers, and actual radiographic findings were identified and compared to the initial markings. Result(s): Patients with larger abdominal circumferences (mean (SD), 94.0(12.1) cm), higher body mass indices (25.9(3.9) kg/m), and aged between 50 and 70 years old had lumbar interspaces that were higher than the presumed level; patients with smaller abdominal circumferences (82.8(13.5) cm) and lower body mass indices (21.6(4.1) kg/m) had intervertebral levels that were lower than the presumed level. Cobb's angle, indicating the degree of lumbar flexion, did not affect the accuracy obtained. Conclusion(s): Patients' abdominal circumference, body mass index, and age are factors that may impact the accuracy of lumbar level identification. Tuffier's line, as identified by palpation, does not seem to be a reliable landmark for proper lumbar interspace identification in all cases.Copyright © Lin et al.",Excluded,0.17247821
869,2107,"Biodistribution and Radiation Dosimetry of 124I-DPA-713, a PET Radiotracer for Macrophage-Associated Inflammation Whole-body PET/CT was performed using 124I-DPA-713, a radioligand for the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), to determine biodistribution and radiation dosimetry. Methods: Healthy subjects aged 18-65 y underwent whole-body PET/CT either at 4, 24, and 48 h or at 24, 48, and 72 h after intravenous injection of 124I-DPA-713. Time-activity curves were generated and used to calculate organ time-integrated activity coefficients for each subject. The resulting time-integrated activity coefficients provided input data for calculation of organ absorbed doses and effective dose for each subject using OLINDA. Subjects were genotyped for the TSPO polymorphism rs6971, and plasma protein binding of 124I-DPA-713 was measured. Results: Three male and 3 female adults with a mean age of 40 +/- 19 y were imaged. The mean administered activity and mass were 70.5 +/- 5.1 MBq (range, 62.4-78.1 MBq) and 469 +/- 34 ng (range, 416-520 ng), respectively. There were no adverse or clinically detectable pharmacologic effects in any of the 6 subjects. No changes in vital signs, laboratory values, or electrocardiograms were observed. 124I-DPA-713 cleared rapidly (4 h after injection) from the lungs, with hepatic elimination and localization to the gastrointestinal tract. The mean effective dose over the 6 subjects was 0.459 +/- 0.127 mSv/MBq, with the liver being the dose-limiting organ (0.924 +/- 0.501 mGy/MBq). The percentage of free radiotracer in blood was approximately 30% at 30 and 60 min after injection. Conclusion: 124I-DPA-713 clears rapidly from the lungs, with predominantly hepatic elimination, and is safe and well tolerated in healthy adults.

870,2108,"Propensity score-based comparison of long-term outcomes with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy vs intensity-modulated radiotherapy for esophageal cancer PURPOSE: Although 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) is the worldwide standard for the treatment of esophageal cancer, intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) improves dose conformality and reduces the radiation exposure to normal tissues. We hypothesized that the dosimetric advantages of IMRT should translate to substantive benefits in clinical outcomes compared with 3D-CRT., METHODS AND MATERIALS: An analysis was performed of 676 nonrandomized patients (3D-CRT, n=413; IMRT, n=263) with stage Ib-IVa (American Joint Committee on Cancer 2002) esophageal cancers treated with chemoradiotherapy at a single institution from 1998-2008. An inverse probability of treatment weighting and inclusion of propensity score (treatment probability) as a covariate were used to compare overall survival time, interval to local failure, and interval to distant metastasis, while accounting for the effects of other clinically relevant covariates. The propensity scores were estimated using logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: A fitted multivariate inverse probability weighted-adjusted Cox model showed that the overall survival time was significantly associated with several well-known prognostic factors, along with the treatment modality (IMRT vs 3D-CRT, hazard ratio 0.72, P<.001). Compared with IMRT, 3D-CRT patients had a significantly greater risk of dying (72.6% vs 52.9%, inverse probability of treatment weighting, log-rank test, P<.0001) and of locoregional recurrence (P=.0038). No difference was seen in cancer-specific mortality (Gray's test, P=.86) or distant metastasis (P=.99) between the 2 groups. An increased cumulative incidence of cardiac death was seen in the 3D-CRT group (P=.049), but most deaths were undocumented (5-year estimate, 11.7% in 3D-CRT vs 5.4% in IMRT group, Gray's test, P=.0029)., CONCLUSIONS: Overall survival, locoregional control, and noncancer-related death were significantly better after IMRT than after 3D-CRT. Although these results need confirmation, IMRT should be considered for the treatment of esophageal cancer. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.22257611
875,2113,"Radiation-related cranial nerve palsy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND: Cranial nerve palsy is a rare complication after patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) receive radiotherapy using a technique that delivers 180-200 centigrays (cGy) per day. Cranial neuropathy is of particular clinical interest in terms of making a differential diagnosis, because it is also a common presenting manifestation in patients with NPC. Cranial neuropathy may lead to distressing signs and symptoms in these patients, and their treatment has not been addressed in previous reports. This article presents the authors' experience with radiotherapy-related cranial nerve palsy in patients with NPC., METHODS: Nineteen patients were diagnosed with radiation-related neuropathy. Patients with recurrent tumors or with a suspicion of persistent or recurrent tumors were excluded. Most patients were treated using 180 cGy or 200 cGy per fraction per day. The total dose was 7000-13,000 cGy to the nasopharynx and 5000-9000 cGy to the neck. Unilateral vocal cord paralysis alone and hearing loss were not included in the analysis., RESULTS: There were 15 male patients and 4 female patients. The latency before palsy occurred was 12-240 months. Single nerve palsy developed in four patients, including two patients with hypoglossal palsy and two patients with recurrent laryngeal palsy. Two patients had three nerve palsies each. The other 13 patients presented with 2 nerve palsies each. Vagus and hypoglossal palsy appeared to be a frequent combination and occurred in 11 patients. Overall, there were 17 patients with hypoglossal palsy (7 bilateral, 8 left-sided, and 2 right-sided), 11 patients with vagus palsy (2 bilateral, 7 left-sided, and 2 right-sided), 6 patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (5 bilateral), and 2 patients with accessory palsies (all bilateral). Marked neck fibrosis was present in 12 patients. Patients who had vocal cord paralysis suffered from easy choking and hoarseness. Severe respiratory difficulty occurred in two patients who had bilateral vocal cord palsy. Surgical procedures included laryngoplasty, tracheostomy, and gastrostomy. Quality of life improved considerably after patients underwent surgery., CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy-related cranial nerve palsy may occur in patients with NPC after they receive conventional radiotherapy. Hypoglossal nerve palsy was found the most frequently in this series, followed by vagus nerve palsy and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Neck fibrosis and the course of the three nerves through the neck may be important risk factors for the development of palsy. The diagnosis must be made only after the possibilities of tumor-induced palsy and idiopathic palsy are excluded. Surgery is helpful in improving the quality of life in many patients.

879,2117,"Treatment of idiopathic hemifacial spasm with radiosurgery or hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy: Preliminary results Introduction: Microvascular decompression in the posterior cranial fossa is the first treatment option for hemifacial spasm. For patients not suitable for surgery because of advanced age, poor general conditions or patients who refuse surgery, radiotherapeutic treatment could be an alternative. Only one case of resolution of hemifacial spasm in a patient undergoing radiosurgery for an intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma has been described in the literature. In this article we present three patients affected by idiopathic hemifacial spasm, refractory to medical therapy and botulinum toxin injections, who were treated by radiosurgery in one case and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy in the other two. Method(s): Radiosurgery, with a single dose of 8Gy, was used in the first patient affected by idiopathic hemifacial spasm and autoimmune polyneuropathy with severe hypoacusia; hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, with 15Gy in 5 fractions of 3Gy each, was preferred in the other 2 cases. In all patients, the target consisted of the vestibulocochlear-facial bundle immediately before its entry into the internal acoustic foramen. Result(s): A marked improvement of symptoms was observed in 2 patients, and almost complete disappearance in the other case, with no complications, particularly, auditory. Conclusion(s): The mean follow-up time of 24 months reported here could be judged too short, and our series too small, but the good results observed so far lead us to underline that, as in trigeminal neuralgia, radiosurgery or hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy could represent a therapeutic alternative to microvascular decompression for idiopathic hemifacial spasm for patients not suitable for surgery. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

880,2118,"Impact of proton pump inhibitor treatment on gastrointestinal bleeding associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use among post-myocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics: Nationwide study Study question What is the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in post-myocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics and treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)? Methods This was a nationwide cohort study based on linked administrative registry data from all hospitals in Denmark between 1997 and 2011. The study included patients aged 30 years and over admitted with a first myocardial infarction who survived at least 30 days after discharge. The association between PPIs and risk of gastrointestinal bleeding according to NSAID plus antithrombotic therapy was estimated using adjusted time dependent Cox regression models. Study answer and limitations The use of PPIs was independently associated with decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in postmyocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics and treated with NSAIDs. Of 82 955 post-myocardial infarction patients (mean age 67.4 years, 64% (n=53 070) men), all of whom were taking single or dual antithrombotic therapy, 42.5% (n=35 233) filled at least one prescription for NSAIDs and 45.5% (n=37 771) received PPIs. Over a mean follow-up of 5.1 years, 3229 gastrointestinal bleeds occurred. The crude incidence rates of bleeding (events/100 person years) on NSAID plus antithrombotic therapy were 1.8 for patients taking PPIs and 2.1 for those not taking PPIs. The adjusted risk of bleeding was lower with PPI use (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.95) regardless of antithrombotic treatment regimen, type of NSAID, and type of PPI used. The main limitation of the study is its observational nonrandomised design. The results suggest that PPI treatment probably has a beneficial effect regardless of underlying gastrointestinal risk and that when NSAIDs cannot be avoided in post-myocardial infarction patients, physicians might prescribe a PPI as well. The study does not clarify whether PPIs might be safely omitted in specific subgroups of patients with a low risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. What this study adds In post-myocardial infarction patients, bleeding complications have been associated with both antithrombotic and NSAID treatment. Concurrent use of PPIs was independently associated with a decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in postmyocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics and NSAID, regardless of antithrombotic treatment regimen, type of NSAID, and type of PPI used.

882,2120,"Potential risk factors and outcomes of fistulas between the upper intestinal tract and the airway following Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy Fistulas between the upper intestinal tract and the airway following esophagectomy are a rare and severe complication with significant mortality. Treatment and therapy are difficult and require a multidisciplinary approach. The objective of this retrospective study was to identify risk factors for these fistulas following esophagetcomy, and to assess their impact on the further clinical course and outcome. 211 patients undergoing Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy for esophageal cancer between 2005 and 2012 were included. The preoperative risk factors including the risk score according to Schroder et al. and theO-Physiological and Operative Severity Score (POSSUM) score, operative and postoperative parameters and the outcome were evaluated. 65% of all patients developed postoperative complications, including 12 patients that developed fistulas between the upper intestinal tract and the airway (airway fistulas [AF]; 5.6%). Neither patient related risk factors nor esophagus-specific risk scores correlated with occurrence of AF. Furthermore, surgical treatment and neoadjuvant treatment did not show any effect on development of AF in our patients. However, we could demonstrate that AF significantly impacted on length of hospital stay (AF 52 days vs. No-AF group 16 days, P < 0.001), incidence of major pulmonary complications (83.3% vs. 17.1%, P < 0.001), 90-day mortality (42% vs. 7.5%, P=0.002) and overall survival (133 days vs. 636 days, P=0.029).With the current study, we could not identify any patient related risk factors, esophagus-specific risk scores or treatment related details that might be useful as predictors of AF after Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy. However, we confirmed that AF significantly impacted on outcomes. This highlights the urgent need for further studies on this rare but devastating complication after esophagectomy.Copyright © 2016 International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus.",Excluded,0.17270605

Result(s): On multivariate analysis, pre-treatment Hb level had a significant correlation to OS (HR:0.53;95% CI:0.33-0.87; p = 0.001), but not to PFS (HR:0.78;95% CI:0.53-1.15; p = 0.12) Patients with pre-treatment Hb >= 12 g/dl had 5-year PFS and OS of 82.2%, compared to 29.3% and 32.8% for those below the threshold. The likelihood to achieve a complete remission increased by 5.6% for every single-unit (g/dl) increase in baseline Hb level over 11 g/dl. On multivariate analysis, response to treatment had a significant correlation to PFS (incomplete vs complete response - HR:5.43;95% CI:2.75-10.7; p < 0.0001) and OS (HR: 6.96;95% CI:2.96-16.5; p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): We showed that baseline Hb level is a strong indicator for poor response to RT-CT in anal cancer patients. A close clinical monitoring for incomplete response to treatment should be advised in patients with low pre-treatment Hb. The hypothesis that the preservation of adequate Hb level during treatment may lead to a better outcome needs prospective evaluation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded,0.17198196
888,2126,"PET quantification of brain O-GlcNAcase with [18F]LSN3316612 in healthy human volunteers Background: Previous studies found that [18F]LSN3316612 was a promising positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in nonhuman primates and human volunteers. This study sought to further evaluate the suitability of [18F]LSN3316612 for human clinical research. Method(s): Kinetic evaluation of [18F]LSN3316612 was conducted in a combined set of baseline brain scans from 17 healthy human volunteers and test-retest imaging was conducted in 10 of these volunteers; another 6 volunteers had whole-body scans to measure radiation exposure to body organs. Total distribution volume (VT) estimates were compared for the one- and two-tissue compartment models with the arterial input function. Test-retest variability and reliability were evaluated via mean difference and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The time stability of VT was assessed down to a 30-min scan time. An alternative quantification method for [18F]LSN3316612 binding without blood was also investigated to assess the possibility of eliminating arterial sampling. Result(s): Brain uptake was generally high and could be quantified as VT with excellent identifiability using the two-tissue compartment model. [18F]LSN3316612 exhibited good absolute test-retest variability (12.5%), but the arithmetic test-retest variability was far from 0 (11.3%), reflecting a near-uniform increase of VT on the retest scan in nine of 10 volunteers. VT values were stable after 110 min in all brain regions, suggesting that no radiometabolites accumulated in the brain. Measurements obtained using only brain activity (i.e., area under the curve (AUC) from 150-180 min) correlated strongly with regional VT values during test-retest conditions (R2 = 0.84), exhibiting similar reliability to VT (ICC = 0.68 vs. 0.64). Estimated radiation exposure for [18F]LSN3316612 PET was 20.5 +/- 2.1 muSv/MBq, comparable to other 18F-labeled radioligands for brain imaging. Conclusion(s): [18F]LSN3316612 is an excellent PET radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in the human brain. Alternative quantification without blood is possible, at least for within-subject repeat studies. However, the unexplained increase of VT under retest conditions requires further investigation.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.17680703
889,2127,"Abnormal bone mineralization after fluoride treatment in osteoporosis: a small-angle x-ray-scattering study Sodium fluoride treatment of osteoporosis is known to stimulate bone formation and to increase bone mass, but recent clinical trials failed to prove its antifracture effectiveness. The formation of bone with abnormal structure and, therefore, increased fragility is discussed as a possible explanation. Until now, however, exact information on the mineral structure of osteoporotic bone after fluoride treatment has been lacking. Bone biopsies were taken from three patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis before and after fluoride treatment (60 mg NaF/day for 1-2 years), from one patient with iatrogenic fluorosis, as well as from three normal controls. The mineral in these samples was investigated by a combination of backscattered electron imaging and small-angle x-ray scattering. Depending on the total dose of fluoride, an increasing amount of new bone is laid down on the surface of preexisting trabeculae. Its mineral structure is identical to that of heavy fluorosis and is characterized by the presence of additional large crystals, presumably located outside the collagen fibrils. These large crystals, which are not present in the controls or in osteoporotic bone before fluoride treatment, contribute to increase the mineral density without significantly improving the biomechanical properties of the bone. The possible success of fluoride treatment depends not only on the amount of newly formed bone but also on the rate of bone turnover. Indeed, as soon as significant amounts of fluoride are present, bone turnover leads to the replacement of old (normal) bone by new (pathologically mineralized) bone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded,0.19037431
895,2133,"Curvature in the cancer mortality dose response in Japanese atomic bomb survivors: absence of evidence of threshold PURPOSES: To investigate the evidence for a threshold in the cancer dose-response curve., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese atomic bomb survivor cancer mortality data, based on follow-up to 1990, was used, taking account of random errors in DS86 dose estimates., RESULTS: For all solid cancers analysed together, there is a significant positive dose response (two-sided p<0.05) if all survivors who received <0.5 Sv are considered, but the significance vanishes if doses of <0.2 Sv are considered; the same is also true for leukaemia. For solid cancer mortality there is no indication of curvilinearity in the dose response: no statistically significant improvement in fit to a linear relative risk model is provided by addition of quadratic or threshold dose terms. If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to solid cancer mortality data, the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.13). If a linear-quadratic-threshold model is used the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI < 0.00-0.15). For leukaemia mortality there is highly statistically significant upward curvature in the dose response. In particular, if a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to the leukaemia data, the best estimate of the threshold is 0.16 Sv (95% CI 0.05-0.40) (two-sided p=0.001 for test of departure of threshold from 0). However, there is no evidence for a threshold effect (two-sided p = 0.16) when a quadratic term is included in the dose response: the best estimate of threshold in this case is 0.09Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.29). Moreover, addition of a quadratic term improves the fit of a linear-threshold model at borderline levels of statistical significance (two-sided p = 0.07). Therefore, the most parsimonious description of the leukaemia dose response is provided by a linear-quadratic function of dose., CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of threshold-type departures from the linear-quadratic dose response either for solid tumours or for leukaemia in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor mortality data.",Included,0.40842515

Fifty-four qualified subjects were enrolled. In the natural state, thermal tomography (TTM) was adopted to shoot the thermograms on the face. After the thermograms collection, the thermo-sensitive detection with moxibustion was applied. The suspending moxibustion with moxa stick was used at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side) for 10 mm. The cases with heat extension and transmission at the acupoint were recorded at the end of moxibustion. In following, the second infrared radiation detection was done so as to record the changes in the infrared images on the face before and after moxibustion and compare the difference in the heat-sensitive state at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side) in the subjects between two detection methods. Before moxibustion, the infrared radiation intensity at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side) in the patients displayed mostly low temperature feature and its sensibility (true positive rate) was 65.6%, the specificity (true negative rate) was 68.2% and the accuracy was 66.7%. After moxibustion at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side), there was an obvious block-diffused increment area of infrared radation along the cheek and its sensitivity (true positive rate) was 81.8%, the specificity (true negative rate) was 81.0% and the accuracy was 81.5% as compared with the moxibustion detection.

899,2137,"Different patterns of allelic imbalance in sporadic tumors and tumors associated with long-term exposure to gamma-radiation The study aimed to reveal cancer related mutations in DNA repair and cell cycle genes associated with chronic occupational exposure to gamma-radiation in personnel of the Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (SGCE). Mutations were analyzed by comparing genotypes of malignant tumors and matched normal tissues of 255 cancer patients including 98 exposed to external gamma-radiation (mean dose 128.1+/-150.5mSv). Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2+/-204.6mSv and 150.5+/-211.2mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133, rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) . Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs. This suggests different mechanisms of inactivation of heterozygous genotypes in sporadic and radiation-induced tumors. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Included,0.96156913

A mouse model of gamma-ray induced leukemia was produced, and by means of quantitative real-time PCR, immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), the expression of mRNA and protein, phosphorylation level, and protein activity of ERK1/2, STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells were investigated in these mice. The results indicated that mRNA and protein expressions of ERK1/2 were upregulated, with significant increase of phosphorylation level and protein activity, but with insignificant differences in mRNA and protein expressions, phosphorylation level and protein activity of STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice compared to the radiation/tumor-free or control mice. It is concluded that in the pathogenesis of gamma-ray induced leukemia in Balb/C mice, activated ERK1/2 pathway may play a role, without involving STAT3 pathway; meanwhile, SHP-2 exerts no regulative effect on pathways of Ras-ERK1/2 and JAK-STAT.",Included,0.96045357
903,2141,"The feasibility of evaluating radiation dose to the heart by integrating kilovoltage-cone beam computed tomography in stereotactic body radiotherapy of early non-small-cell lung cancer patients BACKGROUND: To investigate the feasibility of contouring the planning risk organ volume (PRV) for the heart, and to determine the probability of evaluating radiation dose to the heart using kilovoltage-cone beam computed tomography (kV-CBCT) in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, who received stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen NSCLC patients who received SBRT (5Gy/f x 10f dose) were enrolled and subjected to CBCT and CT imaging analyses to plan treatment. Sequential planning CBCT images of individual patient's hearts were analyzed for reproducibility of heart contouring and volume. Comparative analyses were made between the planning CT- and CBCT-detected heart margins and dose-volume indices for treatment., RESULTS: The heart volume from planning CT images was significantly smaller than that from CBCT scans (p < 0.05), and the volumes based on the different series of CBCT images were similar (p > 0.05). The overlap of the heart region on the same anatomical section between the first series of CBCT scans and other scans reached 0.985 +/- 0.020 without statistically significant differences (p > 0.05). The mean margins of the heart from planning CT and CBCT scans were 10.5 +/- 2.8 mm in the left direction, 5.9 +/- 2.8 mm in the right direction, 2.2 +/- 1.6 mm in the direction of the head, 3.3 +/- 2.2 mm in the direction of the foot, 6.7 +/- 1.1 mm in the anterior direction, and 4.5 mm +/- 2.5 mm in the posterior direction. All relative and absolute dose-volume indices obtained from CBCT images were significantly larger than those from planning CT scans (p < 0.05), with the exception of the volume in the 5Gy region., CONCLUSION: The PRV of heart contouring based on kV-CBCT is feasible with good reproducibility.

In twenty-five stents of 14 patients, undergoing contrast-enhanced CCTA both on 64-slice SDCT (LightSpeedVCT, GE Healthcare) and HDCT (Discovery HD750, GE Healthcare), radiation dose, contrast, noise and stent characteristics were assessed. Two blinded observers graded stent image quality (score 1 = no, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe artefacts). All scans were reconstructed with increasing contributions of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) blending (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 %). Image quality was significantly superior in HDCT versus SDCT (score 1.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.7; p < 0.05). Image noise was significantly higher in HDCT compared to SDCT irrespective of ASIR contributions (p < 0.05). Addition of 40 % ASIR or more reduced image noise significantly in both HDCT and SDCT. In HDCT in-stent luminal attenuation was significantly lower and mean measured in-stent luminal diameter was significantly larger (1.2 +/- 0.4 mm vs. 0.8 +/- 0.4 mm; p < 0.05) compared to SDCT. Radiation dose from HDCT was comparable to SDCT (1.8 +/- 0.7 mSv vs. 1.7 +/- 0.7 mSv; p = ns).

907,2145,"New and evolving concepts in CT for abdominal vascular imaging Computed tomographic (CT) angiography has become the standard of care, supplanting invasive angiography for comprehensive initial evaluation of acute and chronic conditions affecting the vascular system in the abdomen and elsewhere. Over the past decade, the capabilities of CT have improved substantially; simultaneously, the expectations of the referring physician and vascular surgeons have also evolved. Increasingly, CT angiography is used as an imaging biomarker for treatment selection and assessment of effectiveness. However, the growing use of CT angiography has also introduced some challenges, as potential radiation-associated and contrast media-induced risks need to be addressed. These concerns can be partly confronted by modifying scanning parameters (applying a low tube voltage) with or without using software-based solutions. Most recently, multienergy technology has endowed CT with new capabilities offering improved CT angiographic image quality and novel plaque characterization while decreasing radiation and iodine dose. In this article, we discuss current and new approaches using both conventional and multienergy CT for studying vascular disease in the abdomen. We propose various approaches to overcoming commonly encountered image quality challenges in CT angiography. In addition, we describe supplemental strategies for improving patient safety that leverage the available technology.Copyright ©RSNA, 2014.",Excluded,0.17194012
908,2146,"The age-dependent effect of high-dose X-ray radiation on NFkappaB signaling, structure, and mechanical behavior of the intervertebral disc Purpose: Ionizing radiation damages tissue and provokes inflammatory responses in multiple organ systems. We investigated the effects of high-dose X-ray radiation on the molecular inflammation and mechanical function of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Methods: Functional spine units (FSUs) containing the vertebrae-IVDs-vertebrae structure extracted from 1-month, 6-month, and 16-month-old NFkappaB-luciferase reporter mice and from 6-month-old myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-null mice. After a preconditioning period in culture, the FSUs were subjected a single dose of ionizing X-ray radiation at 20 Gys, and then NFkappaB expression was monitored. The IVDs were then subjected to mechanical testing using dynamic compression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, and histological analyses. Results: In the 1-month-old FSUs, the NFkappaB-driven luciferase activity was significantly elevated for 1 day following the exposure to radiation. The 6-month-old FSUs showed increased NFkappaB activity for 3 days, while the 16-month-old FSUs sustained elevated levels of NFkappaB activity throughout the 10-day culture period. All irradiated groups showed significant loss of disc height, GAG content, mechanical function and changes in structure. Ablation of MyD88 blunted the radiation-mediated NFkappaB signaling, and preserved GAG content, and the IVDs' structure and mechanical performance. Conclusions: These results suggest that high-dose radiation affects the IVDs' NFkappaB-dependent inflammatory processes that subsequently lead to functional deterioration. Blocking the transactivation potential of NFkappaB via MyD88 ablation preserved the structure and mechanical function of the FSUs. The long-term effects of radiation on IVD homeostasis should be considered in individuals susceptible to occupational and medical exposure.",Included,0.96217936

The aim of this study was to identify serum metabolite biomarkers that might be used to predict the side-effects of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Patients and Methods: Metabolomic analysis of serum samples from 26 patients with ESCC that were collected before neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was performed. The metabolites associated with hematological toxicity or nephrotoxicity were evaluated. Result(s): Serum levels of glutaric acid, glucuronic acid, and cystine were significantly higher in hematological toxicity, and phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines exhibited a tendency to be higher in those with hematological toxicity. The serum level of pyruvic acid was significantly lower in nephrotoxicity, and lysophosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylethanolamines tended to be lower in those with nephrotoxicity. Conclusion(s): Our study found that serum levels of some metabolites differed significantly between patients with and without hematological or renal side-effects.

The lesions included 14 intrahepatic, 1 hilar, and 2 distal bile duct tumors. Three patients were classified as medically inoperable because of old age or multiple comorbidities. Tumors measured 0.8-13 cm (median, 3.6 cm). The median prescribed dose was 45 Gy delivered in 5 fractions over 5 consecutive days. Result(s): The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 29.9 months. Objective responses were observed for 10 of 17 tumors (58.8%), including 3 complete responses (17.6%). The median survival duration was 12.6 months, and the 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 50.3% and 14.4%, respectively. The 1- and 2-year in-field failure-free rates were 61.5% and 30.8%, respectively. For patients with biologically effective doses (BEDs) exceeding 75 Gy10, the 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 58.3% and 33.3%, respectively, compared to 20.0% and 0%, respectively for those with BEDs lower than 75 Gy10. Radiation-induced liver disease did not develop in any patient. Acute toxicities were generally mild and tolerable.

Methods and Materials: From 2011 to 2013, 105 patients after esophagectomy were treated with postoperative radiotherapy. The intrathoracic stomach was outlined with the calculation of a dose-volume histogram (DVH) for the initial intended treatment of 6020 cGy or 6300 cGy. The volume of the intrathoracic stomach receiving each dose was recorded at 10-Gy intervals between 10 and 40 Gy and at 5-Gy intervals between 40 and 60 Gy. The grade of toxicities was defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0. Result(s): The mean and maximum doses of the intrathoracic stomach were 2449 +/- 986 cGy and 6519 +/- 406 cGy, respectively. Sixteen (15.2%) and three (2.9%) experienced Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 2 and Grade 3 acute gastric toxicity. There were no Grade 4 toxicities. Fourteen patients (13.3%) exhibited late gastric complications possibly related to radiation. The volume percent of the intrathoracic stomach receiving at least 50 Gy (V50) was strongly associated with the degree of toxicity (p = 0.024, respectively). Multivariate analysis of patient and treatmentrelated factors revealed no other significant predictors of severe toxicities.

Method(s): Established acute GVHD model of C57BL/6 -> BALB/c mice. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were dynamically performed in recipient mice after transplant. Lung histopathology and cytokine levels (including TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) were examined in three experimental groups: mice receiving simple irradiation, syngeneic transplants, and allogeneic transplants. Result(s): All allogeneic transplant mice developed aGVHD. On CT, most aGVHD mice had bilateral diffuse lung infiltrates, while syngeneic transplant mice had normal lungs. On histopathology, aGVHD mice had acute pneumonitis. On immunohistochemistry, the infiltrates were mainly CD4+ T cells during aGVHD onset, but CD8+ T cells predominated during aGVHD progression. Lung TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma levels were higher in the three experimental groups than in normal controls on days + 3 and + 7 post-transplant. On day + 7, TNF-alpha levels were higher in allogeneic than in syngeneic transplant mice; IFN-gamma levels were not different. On days + 12 and + 16, TNF-alpha levels were higher but IFN-gamma levels were lower in allogeneic mice than in syngeneic transplant mice. Conclusion(s): The underlying cause of IPS is aGVHD.

Following transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), 35 and 6 patients received intravesical instillations of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and anthracycline-derivants, respectively, whereas 15 received no adjuvant therapy. Five and 2 patients received systemic and local chemotherapy with irradiation, respectively, and six underwent radical cystectomy for invasive potential. The 5-year non-recurrence, progression-free, and overall (cancer-specific) survival rates were 66, 82%, and 76 (88) %, respectively, after a median follow-up of 52 months. The 5-year non-recurrence rates were 24% in non-adjuvant, 85% in BCG, 0% in anthracycline-derivants, 65% in systemic and local chemoradiation therapy, and 68% in cystectomy.

It is considered that antigen-specific T cells are involved in the pathogenesis. However, the role of drug-specific T cells in the skin lesions is not fully investigated. We expanded skin-infiltrating T cells from 4-mm biopsied lesional skin samples of TEN, SJS, DIHS, and erythema multiforme (EM) using anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and IL-2. We obtained >107 cells/specimen by this method. For the drug reactivity, T cells labeled with CFSE were cultured with X-ray-irradiated PBMCs from the same patients and causative drugs, and the proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry. The cytokine profiles of responding T cells were also examined by intracellular staining for interferon (IFN)-gamma;, IL-4, and IL-17, or by cytokine quantification of the supernatants. Both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells proliferated to the causative drugs in all cases. Notably, 80% of expanded CD8+ T cells with the causative drugs expressed high levels of IFN-gamma. The expanded CD4+ T cells bore IFN-gamma, IL-4 or IL-17A at various frequencies. The culture supernatants contained IL-17A at various concentrations. The ability of T cells to produce IL-17A did not correlate with their ability to produce the other cytokines. In DIHS, however, the IL-17A production levels appeared to fluctuate in parallel with the clinical courses. Our results demonstrate that drug-specific T cells are definitely present in the skin infiltrate of severe drug eruptions. It is suggested that drug-reactive, IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells infiltrate at a high frequency and Th17 cells also participate in the formation of lesional skin depending on cases.",Excluded,0.18503244

Result(s): Thirty-six patients (50%) were treated with IMRT alone, while the other 36 patients (50%) were treated by IMRT combined with chemotherapy containing liposomal paclitaxel and cisplatin. Patients treated with chemoradiotherapy showed significantly superior overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to patients treated with IMRT alone (median OS: respectively, 29.7 vs. 12.9 months, P=0.0287; median PFS: respectively, 14.0 vs. 6.5 months, P=0.0186). Multivariate Cox analysis confirmed the inclusion of chemotherapy as an independent predictor of favorable OS and PFS. Both chemoradiotherapy and IMRT were well-tolerated in our cohort. Conclusion(s): Chemotherapy improved the prognosis of locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with IMRT. Large prospective studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic value of IMRT combined with chemotherapy in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine.

920,2158,"Evaluate of the effect of low tube voltage on the radiation dosage using 640-slice coronary CT angiography BACKGROUND: 640-slice coronary CT angiography is becoming an accurate and reliable method of diagnosing coronary heart disease. However, how to reduce the radiation dosage while ensuring the clinically acceptable image quality remains a quite challenging issue., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of low tube voltage on radiation dosage under 640-slice coronary CT angiography (CCTA)., METHODS: Four hundred patients (236 males, 164 females) with coronary heart disease and underwent CCTA using DCVT were classified into A1 (tube voltage: 120 kV; exposure phase window: 30-80%), B1 (120 kV; 70-80%), A2 (100 kV; 30-80%) and B2 group (100 kV; 70-80%), respectively. Image qualities and effective dose (ED) were assessed and compared., RESULTS: No significant differences were observed among the groups in terms of age, height, weight and body mass index (BMI) (P > 0.05). ED were significantly lower in 100 kV group (P < 0.05). CT values of coronary artery in 100 kV groups were 13.5% and 17.3% higher than 120 kV group. ED in B1 group were 64.5% and 67.0% lower than A1 group. ED in B2 group were 65.4% and 65.2% lower than A2 group., CONCLUSION: When using a 640-slice CCTA prospective ECG-gating scanning mode, it is preferable to use a 100 kV tube voltage setting because compared to 120 kV tube voltage protocol, it seems to significantly decrease the mean effective radiation dose, without significantly lowering both the subjective and objective image quality.",Excluded,0.17198128

Patients and Methods: The survival, local control, and toxicities in 22 RCC patients treated between 2001 and 2016 at 6 Japanese PBT institutes were analyzed. Result(s): The 22 patients comprised 20 men and had a median age of 67 (range=42-88) years. The total irradiation dose was 60- 79.6 Gy (relative biological effectiveness). Over a median follow-up of 37 months, the 3-year overall and diseasespecific survival rates were 95% and 100%, respectively, and no recurrence occurred. No patient experienced grade 3 or higher adverse events. The serum blood urea nitrogen (p=0.25) and creatinine levels (p=0.95) were not significantly affected, although the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was reduced by 7.1+/-11.2 ml/min/1.73 m2. Conclusion(s): Despite the small number of patients, high-dose PBT can control RCC while maintaining their renal function with high probability, and could be and alternative curative therapy especially for inoperable patients.Copyright © 2020 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

However, posterior fixation has not yet been decided. We compared the radiographic and clinical outcomes of unilateral versus bilateral instrumented one-level LLIF for degenerative lumbar disease. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 100 patients, who underwent unilateral (group U) or bilateral (group B) instrumented one-level LLIF for degenerative lumbar disease. Forty-one patients in group U were undergoing unilateral pedicle screw instrumentation, and 59 patients in group B were undergoing bilateral pedicle screw instrumentation. Clinical characteristic and demographic data before surgery were compared. The intraoperative data, including operative time with changes in positions, intraoperative blood loss, and X-ray exposure time, as well as the perioperative data, including postoperative hospital stay and clinical and radiographic data were compared. As a result, Group U required a significantly shorter operating time than group B. The subsidence grade and fusion rates exhibited no significant differences in the postoperative radiographic evaluation. Group U had better results in clinical assessments than group B. However, group U required more additional surgeries owing to complications.",Excluded,0.17353044
926,2164,"Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 and age effects on florbetapir positron emission tomography in healthy aging and Alzheimer disease Objectives: Investigate apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE4) gene and aging effects on florbetapir F18 positron emission tomography (PET) in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Method(s): Florbetapir F18 PET images were analyzed from 245 participants, 18-92 years of age, from Avid Radiopharmaceutical's multicenter registered trials, including 86 younger healthy control volunteers (yHC), 61 older healthy control volunteers (oHC), 53 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 45 AD dementia patients (DAT). Mean florbetapir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were used to evaluate the effects of APOE4 carrier status, older age, and their interaction in each of these groups. Result(s): In comparison with non-carriers, the APOE4 carriers in each of the oHC, MCI, and DAT groups had higher mean cortical-to-cerebellar florbetapir SUVRs, patterns of florbetapir PET elevations characteristic of DAT, and a higher proportion meeting florbetapir PET positivity criteria. Only the oHC group had a significant association between mean cortical florbetapir SUVRs and age. In cognitively normal adults, without regards to APOE4 genotype, amyloid began to increase at age 58 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 52.3-63.7), with a predicted typical age of florbetapir positivity occurring around age 71 years. Presence of the APOE4 gene reduced the age of predicted florbetapir positivity in normal aging to around age 56 years, approximately 20 years younger than non-carriers. Interpretation(s): Cerebral amyloid deposition is associated with APOE4 carrier status in older healthy control subjects and symptomatic AD patients, and increases with age in older cognitively normal individuals. Amyloid imaging positivity appears to begin near age 56 years in cognitively intact APOE4 carriers and age 76 years in APOE4 non-carriers. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.17755315
927,2165,"Characteristic imaging findings predicting the risk of conservative treatment resistance in fresh osteoporotic vertebral fractures with poor prognostic features on magnetic resonance imaging Background: Recent studies have reported that confined high-intensity and diffuse low-intensity on sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are distinctive features that are highly predictive of delayed union or nonunion on osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF). The objective of this study was to identify the characteristics of imaging findings predicting the risk for requiring surgical treatment in fresh OVF with poor prognostic features on MRI. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective study of 74 patients (17 men and 57 women with a mean age of 81.1 years) of OVF with the poor prognostic MRI findings. We compared the imaging findings between the surgery group (16 patients) and the conservative group (58 patients): vertebral instability defined as the difference between the vertebral collapse ratio in dynamic X-rays, and the grade of posterior wall injury (Grade I, no spinal canal encroachment; Grade II, <2 mm; Grade III, >=2 mm) as well as the presence or absence of pedicle fracture (Grade I, none; Grade II, unilateral; Grade III, bilateral) on computed tomography. Result(s): The mean vertebral instability was 24.0% +/- 10.1% in the surgery group and 13.0% +/- 7.8% in the conservative group, which was significantly different. Posterior wall injury in the surgery and conservative groups was Grade I in 0 and 29 cases, Grade II in 5 and 21 cases, and Grade III in 11 and 8 cases, respectively, constituting a significant difference. Pedicle fracture in the surgery and conservative groups was Grade I in 5 and 55 cases, Grade II in 6 and 2 cases, and Grade III in 5 and 1 case, respectively, also constituting a significant difference. Conclusion(s): The most high-risk OVF patients with poor prognostic MRI findings who required surgical treatment were those who exhibited greater vertebral instability as well as either more severe posterior wall injury or pedicle fracture.

928,2166,"Coloproctologic disorders of the pelvic floor Purpose. The aim of this review is to describe the most frequent and important coloproctologic pelvic floor disorders. Relevant diagnostic procedures of the pelvic floor will be presented. Material and methods. A host of diagnoses and symptoms such as the descending perineum syndrome, rectocele, cystocele, enterocele, uterine and vaginal descensus, anal and rectal prolaps, outlet obstruction, anismus, inertia recti and intussusception are included under the heading 'pelvic floor disorders'. Although symptoms are often varied, problems concerning urinary and/or faecal continence commonly lead to primary consultation of a physician. Results. Quite often, apparently divergent symptoms such as constipation and incontinence are simultaneously mentioned. A clear gender disposition is observed with female patients inflicted nine-fold in comparison to male patients. The primary consultant may belong to a variety of specialities such as urology, proctology, gynaecology or dermatology, depending upon the predominant symptom. A feeling of trust is essential for the treatment of a disorder involving highly intimate regions of the body. Discussion. An exact medical history and standardized proctologic evaluation consisting of inspection, palpation, rectoscopy and proctoscopy may be augmented by investigations such as anorectal manometry or endosonography. Conventional defecography has been replaced more and more by dynamic MRI of the pelvic floor in specialized institutions, enabling additional gynaecologic and urologic investigations avoiding ionizing radiation.",Excluded,0.1724266
931,2169,"Gamma-radiation sensitivity and polymorphisms in RAD51L1 modulate glioma risk BACKGROUND: DNA strand breaks pose the greatest threat to genomic stability. Genetically determined mutagen sensitivity predisposes individuals to a variety of cancers, including glioma. However, polymorphisms in DNA strand break repair genes that may determine mutagen sensitivity are not well studied in cancer risk, especially in gliomas., METHODS: We correlated genotype data for tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of DNA strand break repair genes with a gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity phenotype [expressed as mean breaks per cell (B/C)] in samples from 426 glioma patients. We also conducted analysis to assess joint and haplotype effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on mutagen sensitivity. We further validate our results in an independent external control group totaling 662 subjects., RESULTS: Of the 392 tSNPs examined, we found that mutagen sensitivity was modified by one tSNP in the EME2 gene and six tSNPs in the RAD51L1 gene (P < 0.01). Among the six RAD51L1 SNPs tested in the validation set, one (RAD51L1 rs2180611) was significantly associated with mutagen sensitivity (P = 0.025). Moreover, we found a significant dose-response relationship between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse tSNP genotypes. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that RAD51L1 haplotypes F-A (zero adverse allele) and F-E (six adverse alleles) exhibited the lowest (0.42) and highest (0.93) mean B/C values, respectively. A similar dose-response relationship also existed between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse haplotypes., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that polymorphisms in and haplotypes of the RAD51L1 gene, which is involved in the double-strand break repair pathway, modulate gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity.",Included,0.95677716
932,2170,"Prognosis of severe lymphopenia after postoperative radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer: Results of a long-term follow up study Purpose: To investigate the incidence and prognosis of severe radiation-induced lymphopenia (sRIL) after postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) for resected NSCLC. Patients and Methods: Between 1998 and 2017, 170 patients treated with PORT for NSCLC were retrospectively reviewed. Lymphopenia was divided into tertiles with severe lymphopenia defined as absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) < 0.37 x 103/ul. Result(s): sRIL was observed in 32.3% of patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated sRIL was associated with planning target volume radiation fraction numbers (OR 1.09, p = 0.005) and total lung mean dose (OR 1.12, p = 0.006). With a median follow-up time of 12.2 years, the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 14.8 months and 28.4 months respectively in patients with sRIL, vs. 21.7 months (p = 0.008) and 48.3 months (p = 0.01) respectively in patients without sRIL. Multivariable analyses indicated sRIL significantly decreased OS (HR 1.95, p < 0.01). Since PORT for stage I-II NSCLC was done largely for positive margins, which may confound the contribution of severe RIL, we analyzed stage III separately and found that sRIL also significantly decreased OS (HR 1.88, p = 0.004) in multivariable analysis. Conclusion(s): For this long-term outcome study, severe RIL correlated with total lung mean dose and radiation fractionation numbers, and was a strong prognostic factor for poor survival in PORT patients, particularly in patients with stage III NSCLC, highlighting the importance of an intact immune system for post-radiation immunologic disease surveillance.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Excluded,0.51560533
934,2172,"DART-bid: dose-differentiated accelerated radiation therapy, 1.8 Gy twice daily: High local control in early stage (I/II) non-small-cell lung cancer Background: While surgery is considered standard of care for early stage (I/II), non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), radiotherapy is a widely accepted alternative for medically unfit patients or those who refuse surgery. International guidelines recommend several treatment options, comprising stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for small tumors, conventional radiotherapy >= 60 Gy for larger sized especially centrally located lesions or continuous hyperfractionated accelerated RT (CHART). This study presents clinical outcome and toxicity for patients treated with a dose-differentiated accelerated schedule using 1.8 Gy bid (DART-bid). Patients and Methods: Between April 2002 and December 2010, 54 patients (median age 71 years, median Karnofsky performance score 70 %) were treated for early stage NSCLC. Total doses were applied according to tumor diameter: 73.8 Gy for < 2.5 cm, 79.2 Gy for 2.5-4.5 cm, 84.6 Gy for 4.5-6 cm, 90 Gy for > 6 cm. Result(s): The median follow-up was 28.5 months (range 2-108 months); actuarial local control (LC) at 2 and 3 years was 88 %, while regional control was 100 %. There were 10 patients (19 %) who died of the tumor, and 18 patients (33 %) died due to cardiovascular or pulmonary causes. A total of 11 patients (20 %) died intercurrently without evidence of progression or treatment-related toxicity at the last follow-up, while 15 patients (28 %) are alive. Acute esophagitis <= grade 2 occurred in 7 cases, 2 patients developed grade 2 chronic pulmonary fibrosis. Conclusion(s): DART-bid yields high LC without significant toxicity. For centrally located and/or large (> 5 cm) early stage tumors, where SBRT is not feasible, this method might serve as radiotherapeutic alternative to present treatment recommendations, with the need of confirmation in larger cohorts.Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded,0.17097037

Methods and Materials Patients with inoperable (due to medical comorbid conditions or patient's refusal to undergo surgery) or unresectable gastric cancer received up to 2 21-day cycles of preradiation and postradiation chemotherapy (docetaxel 37.5 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1-3, and a continuous infusion of fluorouracil [FU] 750 mg/m2 on days 1-5), respectively. CCRT between preradiation and postradiation chemotherapy was initiated on day 43 and consisted of intensity modulated radiation therapy (50.4 Gy) plus concurrent docetaxel 20 mg/m2 weekly for 6 weeks. Results 36 patients were evaluable; 21 patients with comorbid conditions were unsuitable for surgery (group 1), 8 had unresectable disease (group 2), and 7 refused surgery (group 3). The clinical complete response (cCR) rate for the 36 evaluable patients was 36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19%-53%) and the overall response rate was 83% (95% CI, 75%-97%). The median survival time and estimated 2-year survival rate were 25.8 months (95% CI, 7.1-44.5 months) and 52% (95% CI, 38%-67%), respectively. The estimated median OS and 2-year OS rates for groups 1, 2, and 3 were 37.0 months (95% CI, 7.9-66.1 months) and 52% (95% CI, 31%-73%), 17.7 months (95% CI, 7.8-27.6 months) and 20% (95% CI, 0%-49%), and 38.9 months (95% CI, 16.6-58.3 months) and 67% (95% CI, 30%-100%), respectively. Achieving a cCR was associated with significantly better overall survival (P=.004) and progression-free survival (P=.003). The most common grade 3 or greater toxicity during the chemotherapy phase was neutropenia. Common grade 3/4 toxicities during CCRT were nausea and vomiting.

Postoperative relapse (POR) occurs with high incidence even if a radical resection is performed. The current investigation was designed to identify prognostic factors for POR and to establish a nomogram model to estimate the risk for the onset of POR of ORNM. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective study was conducted in ORNM patients during the period from 2003 to 2016. Predictive factors for POR were preliminarily filtered by Kaplan-Meier analysis and were further confirmed by Cox regression model. A nomogram model was established to predict the risk for the onset of POR, and the performance was estimated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and calibration curve. POR was defined as the primary outcome variable and was measured using univariate and multivariate analyses. Result(s): A total of 213 patients were analyzed, and the total incidence of POR was 24.4% (52/213). In the Cox regression analysis, radiation doses >=80 Gy (versus80 Gy, OR = 3.528, P0.001, 95% CI: 1.759-7.076), location of ORNM (lesion only in mandibular body versus that involving mandibular body, angulus and ramus versus, OR = 2.900, P = 0.007, 95% CI: 1.345-6.253), S classification (S2 versus S0, OR = 8.926, P = 0.001, 95% CI: 2.487-32.036), and surgical treatment (sequestretomy versus ER + reconstruction, OR = 3.299, P = 0.012, 95% CI: 1.294-8.411) were significantly associated with POR. The current nomogram model can effectively evaluate the hazard risk and survival rate of POR. The discrimination capability was tested by the ROC curve with an area under the curve of 0.813, revealing highly predictive abilities. The calibration curve showed sufficient fitness.

939,2177,"Hyperthermia and radiation therapy for inoperable or recurrent parotid carcinoma. A phase I/II study BACKGROUND: The treatment of advanced, inoperable, or recurrent parotid tumors represents a clinical challenge. The results obtained with conventional radiotherapy are disappointing. To improve the early response and local control of parotid tumors, local microwave hyperthermia was used in combination with ionizing radiation in a biinstitutional Phase I/II study., METHODS: From 1984 to 1991, 13 patients (20 lesions) with advanced (10 lesions) or recurrent (10 lesions) parotid tumors (15 primaries and the remaining 5 nodal metastases), were treated with 300-915 MHz of external hyperthermia after external irradiation. Heat was applied twice weekly at a minimum desired temperature of 42.0 degrees C for 30 minutes at steady state. Ionizing radiation was delivered using photon, electron, or mixed electron-photon beams; the prescribed total dose was 70 Gy and 30 Gy for untreated and previously treated lesions, respectively; the median computed total dose was 66 Gy for previously untreated patients (range, 56-70 Gy) and 30 Gy for previously irradiated patients (range, 28-32 Gy)., RESULTS: Acute side effects were limited. Major acute toxicities included three patients (15%) with superficial necrosis, two of three who healed spontaneously in 4 and 6 months. Clinical response evaluated during the third month after the completion of therapy found that 16/20 patients (80%) had a complete response (CR), and 4 (20%) had a partial response. Four out of 16 patients who had CRs (20%) had a local recurrence, resulting in an actuarial local control at 5 years of 62.3 +/- 13.2%., CONCLUSIONS: The combined treatment of local microwave hyperthermia and ionizing radiation proved to be feasible and moderately toxic for patients with advanced, inoperable, or recurrent parotid tumors. Even if clinical result evaluation was not the study endpoint, early response, and 5-year local control rates were encouraging.",Excluded,0.17789167

The Spanish translation was carried out following international guidelines for the process of cross-cultural adaptation of self-report measures. A cross-sectional design study was carried out. One hundred and thirty-eight nurses from four different hospitals in Barcelona (Spain) completed the Spanish version of the scale. The total score of the scale was calculated. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was used to evaluate a possible correlation between score and years of experience. A t-test for independent samples was used to evaluate significant differences between different groups. Cronbach's alpha, the corrected item-total correlation coefficient and the test-retest coefficient were used to determine internal consistency. The exploratory factor and parallel analysis were also calculated. All statistical tests were carried out with a level of significance alpha = 0.05. The mean scale score was poor among Spanish nurses. The PCC between total score and years of experience showed a non-significant correlation (p > 0.05). No differences were found between nurses who worked in radiation-exposed units and those who worked in units without radiation exposure (p > 0.05). A Cronbach alpha of 0.98 was obtained for the items of the scale. The corrected item-total correlation range was 0.5-0.8. The test-retest correlation coefficient was 0.9.

A dose of 7 mL was used for each of 3 acquisitions: images were obtained of each foot in the sagittal plane, and then both feet were imaged simultaneously in the transverse plane. The following parameters were used for acquisition: (TR/TE 4.7 milliseconds/ 1.3 milliseconds, field of view = 28 cm, Flip angle = 30 degrees, 384 x 256 matrix, section thickness = 1.6 mm, Bandwidth = 19.23). The dorsalis pedis, plantar arch, distal posterior tibial, lateral tarsal, and medial plantar arteries were graded for visualization, artifact, and overall image quality on a 4-point scale (1 = worst; 4 = best)., RESULTS: Superior visualization trended towards separate sagittal acquisitions when compared with that of bilateral transverse acquisitions for most of the individual vessels of the foot. Overall, separate sagittal acquisitions (average score = 2.9) were superior to bilateral transverse acquisitions (average score = 2.6). The average image quality score reflecting the amount of artifact was 2.6 for studies obtained using bilateral transverse acquisitions and 3.1 for studies obtained using separate sagittal acquisitions., CONCLUSION: Low-dose gadolinium multi-injection TRICKS and bolus-chase MR angiography at 3.0 T provides an effective and easily reproducible technique for imaging of the pedal vasculature in volunteers and has great potential for clinical application.",Excluded,0.17082158

Corticosteroids are first-line therapy, but relapses are frequent leading to therapeutic escalation. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor with rapid effect on monoclonal component. However, its use in non-IgM type I CV has been barely reported. Objective(s): To assess the efficacy of bortezomib in non-IgM type I CV. Method(s): Single-centre case series of four patients with non-IgM type I CV treated with bortezomib monotherapy. Result(s): Two men and two women, 60-84 years old, received bortezomib monotherapy. Monoclonal component was IgG-lambda (n = 2), IgA-lambda and IgG-kappa. Clinical features were necrotic rash (n = 3), synovitis (n = 3) and sensitive neuropathy (n = 2). CV was refractory to corticosteroids (n = 4), cyclophosphamide (n = 3) and rituximab (n = 2). Three patients experienced dramatic clinical improvement with undetectable cryoglobulin after three cycles (bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 weekly). Each patient relapsed 4-18 months after treatment discontinuation. Bortezomib was unsuccessful after four cycles in one patient. Bortezomib toxicity included one pneumonia and 1 case of worsening neuropathic pain. Conclusion(s): Bortezomib in monotherapy should be considered as a valuable option in refractory non-IgM type I CV because of its swift efficacy and acceptable tolerance profile.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

959,2197,"Electrical exposure analysis of galvanic-coupled intra-body communication based on the empirical arm models Background: Intra-body communication (IBC) is one of the highlights in studies of body area networks. The existing IBC studies mainly focus on human channel characteristics of the physical layer, transceiver design for the application, and the protocol design for the networks. However, there are few safety analysis studies of the IBC electrical signals, especially for the galvanic-coupled type. Besides, the human channel model used in most of the studies is just a multi-layer homocentric cylinder model, which cannot accurately approximate the real human tissue layer. Method(s): In this paper, the empirical arm models were established based on the geometrical information of six subjects. The thickness of each tissue layer and the anisotropy of muscle were also taken into account. Considering the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines, the restrictions taken as the evaluation criteria were the electric field intensity lower than 1.35 x 104 f V/m and the specific absorption rate (SAR) lower than 4 W/kg. The physiological electrode LT-1 was adopted in experiments whose size was 4 x 4 cm and the distance between each center of adjoining electrodes was 6 cm. The electric field intensity and localized SAR were all computed by the finite element method (FEM). The electric field intensity was set as average value of all tissues, while SAR was averaged over 10 g contiguous tissue. The computed data were compared with the 2010 ICNIRP guidelines restrictions in order to address the exposure restrictions of galvanic-coupled IBC electrical signals injected into the body with different amplitudes and frequencies. Result(s): The input alternating signal was 1 mA current or 1 V voltage with the frequency range from 10 kHz to 1 MHz. When the subject was stimulated by a 1 mA alternating current, the average electric field intensity of all subjects exceeded restrictions when the frequency was lower than 20 kHz. The maximum difference among six subjects was 1.06 V/m at 10 kHz, and the minimum difference was 0.025 V/m at 400 kHz. While the excitation signal was a 1 V alternating voltage, the electric field intensity fell within the exposure restrictions gradually as the frequency increased beyond 50 kHz. The maximum difference among the six subjects was 2.55 V/m at 20 kHz, and the minimum difference was 0.54 V/m at 1 MHz. In addition, differences between the maximum and the minimum values at each frequency also decreased gradually with the frequency increased in both situations of alternating current and voltage. When SAR was introduced as the criteria, none of the subjects exceeded the restrictions with current injected. However, subjects 2, 4, and 6 did not satisfy the restrictions with voltage applied when the signal amplitude was >= 3, 6, and 10 V, respectively. The SAR differences for subjects with different frequencies were 0.062-1.3 W/kg of current input, and 0.648-6.096 W/kg of voltage input. Conclusion(s): Based on the empirical arm models established in this paper, we came to conclusion that the frequency of 100-300 kHz which belong to LF (30-300 kHz) according to the ICNIRP guidelines can be considered as the frequency restrictions of the galvanic-coupled IBC signal. This provided more choices for both intensities of current and voltage signals as well. On the other hand, it also makes great convenience for the design of transceiver hardware and artificial intelligence application. With the frequency restrictions settled, the intensity restrictions that the current signal of 1-10 mA and the voltage signal of 1-2 V were accessible. Particularly, in practical application we recommended the use of the current signals for its broad application and lower impact on the human tissue. In addition, it is noteworthy that the coupling structure design of the electrode interface should attract attention.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded,0.17538448

METHOD(S): Twelve histologically confirmed patients with metastatic MTC were included. All patients underwent both 111In-DTPA-octreotide imaging and 131I/ 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging. According to the results of the combined imaging, positive patients were selected to be treated with 90Y-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC) or 131I-MIBG, respectively. The therapeutic procedures of targeted internal radiation were performed with 3.33 GBq 90Y-DOTATOC at 6-week intervals, or 11.1 GBq 131I-MIBG with a minimum interval of three months. RESULT(S): The imaging procedure was positive in all 12 patients: 111In-DTPA-octreotide imaging in eight patients, 131I/ 123I-MIBG imaging in six patients. According to the results of combined imaging, we identified four patients to be treated with 90Y-DOTATOC, and five patients with 131 I-MIBG. After three to five sessions of treatment, three patients with partial remission and six with stable disease were observed. The effective rate was 3/9 (33.3%) and the overall tumor response rate was 9/9 (100%). No relevant toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION(S): The combined imaging technique can be used to identify patients for effective radionuclide treatment. The treatment with 90Y-DOTATOC or 131I-MIBG is well tolerated and may improve the fate of patients with metastatic MTC.",Excluded,0.17247385
962,2200,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase, a therapeutic target in chordoma: Analysis in 3d cellular models Chordomas are rare, slow-growing tumors of the axial skeleton. These tumors are locally aggressive and refractory to conventional therapies. Radical surgery and radiation remain the first-line treatments. Despite these aggressive treatments, chordomas often recur and second-line treatment options are limited. The mechanisms underlying chordoma radioresistance remain unknown, although several radioresistant cancer cells have been shown to respond favorably to aldehyde de-hydrogenase (ALDH) inhibition. The study of chordoma has been delayed by small patient cohorts and few available models due to the scarcity of these tumors. We thus created cellular 3D models of chordoma by using low-adherence culture systems. Then, we evaluated their radiosensitivity using colony-forming and spheroid size assays. Finally, we determined whether pharmacologically inhibiting ALDH increased their radiosensitivity. We found that 3D cellular models of chordoma (derived from primary, relapse, and metastatic tumors) reproduce the histological and gene expression features of the disease. The metastatic, relapse, and primary spheroids displayed high, me-dium, and low radioresistance, respectively. Moreover, inhibiting ALDH decreased the radiore-sistance in all three models.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded,0.71133655
964,2202,"Impact of concurrent chemoradiation on quality of life in Indian patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers Background: Concurrent chemo radiation remains the standard of care, in the management of patients with loco-regionally advanced head and neck cancers. Conventionally, the endpoints for head and neck cancer patients focused on objective tumor response, local control and overall survival. These endpoints are assessed from the physician's point of view.and in view of increased number of longtime survivors, the need for understanding patients experience, their perceptions of treatment effects and their priorities have to be well recognized, Hence a prospective study was conducted to evaluate the quality of life in Indian patients of locally advanced head and neck cancer patients undergoing concurrent chemo radiation. Method(s): Single arm prospective observational study of 53 patients receiving concurrent chemo-radiation were assessed for changes in quality of life using EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC -H&N35 questionnaires at baseline before treatment , 4th week during treatment,on completion of treatment,4weeks and 12 weeks after treatment.Data analysis was done using paired t test for each variable comparing each of the assessments done during treatment, on completion of treatment, 1 month post completion of treatment and 3months post completion of treatment comparing with baseline values . Result(s): Mean age of the study population was 52.48 +/- 11.6 years (Age range 28-72 years). There were 33.3% females and 66.7% males.There was a significant decrease in Global health related quality of life during treatment(P < 0.001) and on completion of treatment(p < 0.001) when compared to baseline scores but showing upward trends in scores post 1month and 3 month of treatment compared to baseline scores. Conclusion(s): There was significant deterioration in Quality of life during and after curative intent concurrent chemo-radiotherapy in Indian patients that gradually but definitely improves over time.

965,2203,"Dose-painting intensity-modulated proton therapy for intermediate- and high-risk meningioma Background: Newly diagnosed WHO grade II-III or any WHO grade recurrent meningioma exhibit an aggressive behavior and thus are considered as high- or intermediate risk tumors. Given the unsatisfactory rates of disease control and survival after primary or adjuvant radiation therapy, optimization of treatment strategies is needed. We investigated the potential of dose-painting intensity-modulated proton beam-therapy (IMPT) for intermediate- and high-risk meningioma. Material(s) and Method(s): Imaging data from five patients undergoing proton beam-therapy were used. The dose-painting target was defined using [68]Ga-[1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid]- d-Phe1,Tyr3-octreotate ([68]Ga-DOTATATE)-positron emission tomography (PET) in target delineation. IMPT and photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment plans were generated for each patient using an in-house developed treatment planning system (TPS) supporting spot-scanning technology and a commercial TPS, respectively. Doses of 66 Gy (2.2 Gy/fraction) and 54 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) were prescribed to the PET-based planning target volume (PTVPET) and the union of PET- and anatomical imaging-based PTV, respectively, in 30 fractions, using simultaneous integrated boost. Result(s): Dose coverage of the PTVsPET was equally good or slightly better in IMPT plans: dose inhomogeneity was 10 +/- 3% in the IMPT plans vs. 13 +/- 1% in the IMRT plans (p = 0.33). The brain Dmean and brainstem D50 were small in the IMPT plans: 26.5 +/- 1.5 Gy(RBE) and 0.002 +/- 0.0 Gy(RBE), respectively, vs. 29.5 +/- 1.5 Gy (p = 0.001) and 7.5 +/- 11.1 Gy (p = 0.02) for the IMRT plans, respectively. The doses delivered to the optic structures were also decreased with IMPT. Conclusion(s): Dose-painting IMPT is technically feasible using currently available planning tools and resulted in dose conformity of the dose-painted target comparable to IMRT with a significant reduction of radiation dose delivered to the brain, brainstem and optic apparatus. Dose escalation with IMPT may improve tumor control and decrease radiation-induced toxicity.Copyright © 2015 Madani et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",Excluded,0.17212488

This retrospective study evaluates the long-term results and side effects of GKR in the treatment of TN focusing on potentially predictive factors. METHOD(S): One hundred sixty patients with TN were included in this study (minimum follow-up, >6 mo; mean, 37.4 mo; range, 6-144 mo). In 92 patients, GKR represented the first nonmedical option (""primary GKR""). In 68 patients, invasive treatments had been previously attempted. All patients were treated using a single 4-mm collimator shot targeting the pontine trigeminal root entry zone with a maximal dose of 75 to 95 Gy. Brainstem dose exposure never exceeded 15 Gy. Treatment outcome results were classified as Grade I (pain-free with no pharmacological treatment), Grade II (pain-free with pharmacological treatment), and Grade III (no result). Data were analyzed using the log-rank test for univariate analysis and the ordered logit model for multivariate analysis. RESULT(S): In the overall series, 98 (61%) out of 160 patients reached a Grade I outcome, 45 (29%) reached a Grade II outcome, and 17 (10%) patients had no results from GKR. These results were encouraging for patients with typical facial pain features and for patients treated by a ""primary"" gamma knife. Considering the global outcome, the most effective and safest dose was found to be in the 80 to 90 Gy range. CONCLUSION(S): According to our experience, GKR represents a reliable second-line therapeutic approach for TN after pharmacological failure. Favorable prognostic factors include ""primary GKR"" and maximal GKR dose ranging between 80 and 90 Gy. Copyright © by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",Excluded,0.17143415
975,2213,"Ocular Radiation Threshold Projection Based off of Fluoroscopy Time During ERCP Objectives: Current international guidelines for ocular radiation exposure suggest a threshold of 20 millisieverts (mSv)/year. Although endoscopists wear lead aprons, use of protective eye wear is optional. This study was conducted to analyze the lens radiation exposure during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for endoscopists to determine the time of fluoroscopy needed to warrant using lens protection during ERCP. Method(s): ERCP patients were prospectively enrolled. Indications, interventions, fluoroscopy time, dose, and attending +/- fellow involvement were recorded. Radiation exposure was collected from body dosimeters and dosimeters placed between the eyes. Cumulative radiation doses were obtained at study completion and averaged over the total fluoroscopy time to determine the mSv/hour exposure. Result(s): A total of 187 cases were included. Attendings and fellows wore lens dosimeters in 178 and 126 cases, respectively, and body dosimeters in 174 and 128 cases, respectively. Attendings and fellows wore lens dosimeters throughout 15.89 and 11.24 h of fluoroscopy, respectively. The cumulative radiation dose absorbed per lens dosimeters was 5.35 mSv for attendings and 2.55 mSv for fellows. The projected lens absorption by the body dosimeters was 19.03 mSv for attendings and 5.21 mSv for fellows. The hourly fluoroscopy lens exposure was 0.34 mSv/hour for attendings and 0.23 mSv/hour for fellows. Conclusion(s): The amount of fluoroscopy hours needed to reach the currently suggested lens threshold limit (20 mSv/year) was 59.41 h for attendings and 88.17 h for fellows. Radioprotective eye wear should be worn by physicians with yearly fluoroscopy times in similarly structured practices that meet or exceed these thresholds.Copyright © 2017 by the American College of Gastroenterology.",Excluded,0.17061327
977,2215,"Is it necessary to perform X-ray absorptiometry in young IBD patients to predict the risk of fracture? BACKGROUND:Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients have an increased risk of osteoporosis related fractures. Necessity of bone density measurement in IBD patients is not clearly defined, however, the risk of fracture increases among them. Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) score computes the 10-years probability of the major osteoporotic fractures and particularly hip fracture. Clinical FRAX (c-FRAX) does not include the bone mineral density (BMD) measurement. We aimed to compare the value the c-FRAX to FRAX enhanced with dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) (bmd-FRAX) in IBD patients. METHOD(S):169 consecutive IBD patients (128 Crohn's disease (CD) and 41 ulcerative colitis (UC); female/male: 88/81) were included into the study. Mean age of the patients was 35.9+/-11.7 years, 7.6% of them was postmenopausal women. FRAX-scores were calculated with the online tool using a Hungarian algorithm. Bone mineral density measurements were performed by DEXA. Calculations were performed using SPSS statistics 15.0 software. RESULT(S):In patients under 40 the c-FRAX score regarding major osteoporotic fracture risk was significantly higher compared to bmd-FRAX (1,9+/-1,1 vs. 1,4+/-0,8, p<0,01). The same difference was observed computing the probability of hip fractures (c-FRAX: 0,4+/-0,7 vs. bmd-FRAX: 0,3+/-0,5; p <0,05). In a subgroup analysis the fracture risks have not differed in CD vs. UC patients. Major fracture risk c-FRAX and bmd-FRAX were 3,0+/-3,4% es 2,4+/-2,7% in CD and 3.4+/-3.4% and 2.5+/-2.4% in UC patients (non-significant (NS)). Clinical FRAX and bmd-FRAX showing hip fracture risk were 0.8+/-1.5% and 0.6+/-1.4% in CD and 0.8+/-1.3% and 0.4+/-0.7% in UC, respectively (NS). We did not observe any correlation between FRAX scores and calcium intake, physical activity, severity, extent- and duration of the disease. Subgroup analysis regarding steroid use and body mass index has not been performed due to the FRAX system included in these parameters. CONCLUSION(S):Guidelines regarding IBD associated osteoporosis advise to perform the DEXA measurements in patients with some special risk factors for bone loss. In our study the fracture risk according to FRAX scores completed with DEXA were lower than clinical FRAX - especially in patients younger than 40 years. Our results suggest that DEXA enhanced FRAX may have an advantageous role in preventing over medicating young IBD patients.",Excluded,0.17170551

METHOD(S): A retrospective chart review of 43 patients with PFF seen over a 4 year period in a community based outpatient fracture clinic was conducted. A complete history and physical, review of medical records and x-rays, CBC, chemistry profile, TSH, urinalysis, vitamin B12, 25-OH vitamin D, PTH, and immunofixation(IMF) was done in all patients. Antiparietal cell(APA) and intrinsic factor(IF) antibody and SPE was done in select cases. Comorbidity including history of solid tumor, diabetes, COPD, cardiac and neurologic disorder were tabulated. RESULT(S): There were 38 females and 5 males ranging in age 55-95 years(mean 82.3). 23 patients had a previous major osteoporotic fracture and 8 a total hip replacement. 17 had received previous osteoporosis treatment. 40 patients were living at home and 22 were still driving within 3 months prior to the fall causing the PFF. 13 were using ambulatory aids. Patients had 0-3(mean 0.93) comorbid conditions: COPD-11, cardiac-11, cancer-7, neurologic-6, and diabetes-5. 2 patients had previous radiation therapy to the pelvic area. The BMI was 20< in 9 patients and 19 had peripheral neuropathy(PN). CT or MRI confirmed the PFF in 37 patients and showed fractures of the sacrum-17, acetabulum-7, and both sacrum and acetabulum-5 in addition to the pelvic rami. Monoclonal protein was found with IMF in 17(42%) patients: IgG-7, IgG-6, and light chains-4. M-spike was found in 8. 5(14%) patients had low vitamin B12 and either APA or IF. 3 patients had vitamin D levels 20<ng/ml and 7 had hyponatremia. Alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 12 patients. 29 patients required rehabilitation in a nursing home. During follow up (mean 20.7 months) 12(31%) patients died,10 within 1 year after PFF from causes unrelated to the fracture. CONCLUSION(S): PFF occurs predominantly in female, elderly, independent and active patients with few comorbid conditions and is associated with significant morbidity. PFF may be a prelude to mortality within 1 year of occurrence. CT or MRI scans are necessary to define the full extent of injury to the pelvis. Although the clinical characteristics may differ between PFF, hip, and vertebral fracture patients, they all share age related conditions such as low BMI, PN, MGUS, pernicious anemia and hyponatremia that predispose to falling and bone fragility.",Excluded,0.17121714

METHOD(S): From January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2012, 192 consecutive locally advanced ESCC patients who had undergone trimodality therapy successfully were included. Grouping was based on the degree of myelosuppression occurred during preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Of the 192 patients, 120 patients underwent trimodality therapy only (group A), while 72 patients received postoperative chemotherapy additionally after trimodality therapy (group B). Preoperative chemoradiotherapy included two cycles of chemotherapy concurrently with radiotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen consisted of cisplatin 20 mg/(m2.d) and fluorouracil 400 mg/(m2.d) administered intravenously on days 1-5 of a 21-days cycle. Concurrent radiotherapy was delivered in a total of 40 Gy in 20 fractions. All patients underwent surgery successfully. For 72 patients in group B, additional 1 to 4 cycles of postoperative chemotherapy were administered and chemotherapy regimen was as before. RESULT(S): The 1, 3 and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 87.4%, 51.9% and 43.5% in group A, as compared with 93.0%, 58.5% and 48.8% in the group B (chi2=1.390, P=0.238). The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 34.0% in group A and 38.8% in group B (chi2 =3.883, P=0.049). Outcome of Cox proportional-hazard regression model showed that complete pathological response(P=0.014, HR=1.420, 95%CI: 1.074~1.878) and negative lymph node (P=0.006, HR=1.979, 95%CI: 1.221~3.209)were associated with significantly improved OS. Likely, complete pathological response(P=0.056, HR=1.273, 95%CI: 0.994~1.631) and negative lymph node(P=0.004, HR=1.753, 95%CI: 1.121~2.742) were associated with improved PFS. Risk reduction in PFS was remarkable for males and those who did not achieve pathologic complete response (pCR). CONCLUSION(S): The addition of postoperative chemotherapy demonstrates no overall survival benefit for patients with locally advanced ESCC, but PFS is significantly improved, especially for males and those who did not achieve pCR.Copyright ©, 2015, The Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

We have compared three schedules of non-platinum-based CT plus either radiotherapy or chemoradiation. From May 2001 to June 2006, 158 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC were enrolled in a randomized phase II trial with overall response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint. The initial design included three arms: sequential CT followed by thoracic radiation (TRT); concurrent CT/TRT followed by consolidation CT; and induction CT followed by concurrent CT/TRT. However, based on the preliminary results of the RTOG 9410 trial, the sequential arm was closed when 19 patients had been enrolled. All patients received two cycles of docetaxel 40mg/m2 days 1 and 8 plus gemcitabine 1200mg/m2 days 1 and 8, as either induction or consolidation therapy. Concurrent CT/TRT consisted of docetaxel 20mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 2 weekly plus 60Gy TRT. No differences were found in ORR between the two arms (56% and 57%). Hematological toxicity was mild but significantly superior with consolidation CT; the esophagitis rate was similar in both arms (16% and 15%).

991,2229,"Gender-related significance of time interval between radiotherapy and surgery in hypofractionated preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer patients' survival Aim and background: An optimal break between radiotherapy (RT) and surgery in short-course of RT (SCRT) for locally advanced rectal cancer is not clearly established.The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the break in the preoperative SCRT and overall treatment time (OTT) for locally advanced rectal cancer patients (whole group and male/female subgroups) on patients overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS). Material(s) and Method(s): 131 patients were treated with SCRT (5 Gy/5 days), followed by surgery 3-53 days later. Break was calculated as the time interval between the end of irradiation to surgery and OTT as time interval from the beginning of RT to surgery. Result(s): Mean break was 21.5 (range 3-53.0) days and mean OTT was 26.5 (range 7-58.0) days. In univariate analysis, a break longer than 15 days and OTT >23 days were negative prognostic factors for OS for all patients, and particularly for the male patients' subgroup. RFS was non-significantly higher (P = 0.066) for patients treated with a break <=15 days and OTT <=23 days (P = 0.099), irrespectively of patients' sex. Patients treated with a break longer than 15 days and OTT >23 days had non-significantly lower level of MFS than those treated with a shorter break (P = 0.269) and OTT <=23 days (P = 0.498). Conclusion(s): In SCRT, a break in the treatment longer than 15 days, especially in the male patients subgroup, should be avoided, because it negatively affects patients' survival.Copyright © 2016 Greater Poland Cancer Centre.",Excluded,0.17234972
997,2235,"The use of an air bubble curtain to reduce the received sound levels for harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) In December 2005 construction work was started to replace a harbor wall in Kerteminde harbor, Denmark. A total of 175 wooden piles were piled into the ground at the waters edge over a period of 3 months. During the same period three harbor porpoises were housed in a marine mammal facility on the opposite side of the harbor. All animals showed strong avoidance reactions after the start of the piling activities. As a measure to reduce the sound exposure for the animals an air bubble curtain was constructed and operated in a direct path between the piling site and the opening of the animals' semi-natural pool. The sound attenuation effect achieved with this system was determined by quantitative comparison of pile driving impulses simultaneously measured in front of and behind the active air bubble curtain. Mean levels of sound attenuation over a sequence of 95 consecutive pile strikes were 14 dB (standard deviation (s.d.) 3.4 dB) for peak to peak values and 13 dB (s.d. 2.5 dB) for SEL values. As soon as the air bubble curtain was installed and operated, no further avoidance reactions of the animals to the piling activities were apparent.",Excluded,0.17636178

The study of radiosensitivity based on LD50 value showed that the highest radiosensitivity differences were related to the cyst selection technique and not to the age. Furthermore, the three cyst populations showed that radio-induced lethal effects were enhanced, or appeared with time, namely following the delay between irradiation and the cyst development study.

1001,2239,"The diagnosis of acute urethral trauma Background: During trauma resuscitation, blind catheterization of an injured urethra may aggravate the injury by disrupting a partially torn urethra. In busy trauma centers, retrograde urethrograms (RUG) prior to catheterisation for all patients with unstable pelvic fractures presents a challenge during trauma resuscitation, and the procedure is not commonly practiced despite Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) and World Health Organisation recommendations. The aim of this study was to determine the presenting clinical features of patients with urethral injuries and to predict major trauma patients needing further investigation to exclude this injury. Method(s): A retrospective review of adult major trauma patients diagnosed with urethral injuries during an 8-year period at a major trauma centre, was conducted. Result(s): There were 998 major trauma patients with fractures of the pelvis over the study period, of whom 223 had pubic symphysis disruption. There were 29 patients with urethral injuries. The sensitivity of any one of the traditional signs of urethral trauma was 66.7% (95% CI: 46.0-82.8). After exclusion of patients with penetrating trauma and iatrogenic injuries, pubic symphysis disruption on initial pelvis AP X-ray and/or the clinical signs of urethral injury had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 84.4-100.0) for urethral trauma. Discussion(s): Reliance on clinical features alone to predict urethral injury results in a substantial proportion of missed injuries in major trauma patients. RUGs did not appear to be needed in patients with no disruption of the pubic symphysis on initial pelvis X-ray or where no signs of urethral injury are present. In the absence of clinical signs and pubic symphysis disruption, blind urethral catheterisation may be attempted. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded,0.1711683
1005,2243,"Concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer - A pilot study by using daily low-dose cisplatin and continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil Background: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) has recently become a promising treatment for esophageal cancer. However, most investigators have adopted the conventional or modified Wayne-State PF (cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil) regimen, which is inevitably associated with moderate to severe treatment-related toxicities. In this pilot study, we incorporated a daily low-dose regimen of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil into CCRT in order to improve the compliance of the patients. Patients and Methods: Between July 1993 and Dec. 1997, 25 patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer (T3, or N1 disease), received CCRT which consisted of daily low-dose cisplatin (6 mg/m2/day) and continuous infusion of 5-FU (225 mg/m2/day) with radiotherapy (fraction size = 200-250 cGy/day). Except for the initial 9 patients, for whom post-CCRT esophagectomy was compulsory, all subsequent patients underwent esophagectomy only when inadequate response to CCRT was noted. The scheduled radiation dose was 50 Gy for the first 9 patients, and 60 Gy for the rest of the patients. Result(s): Eighteen patients (72%) completed the CCRT without interruption. Clinically, there were 8 CR and 9 PR, with a total response rate of 68% (47-87%, 95% C.I.). All patients were evaluable for toxicity. Grade 3/4 leukopenia and thrombocytopenia developed in 14 (56%) and 7 (28%) patients, respectively. Grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity was seen in 4 (16%) patients. The median survival of the whole group was 8 months (range: 2-59+). The projected 3-year overall survival was 24%. Conclusion(s): We suggest that for locally advanced esophageal cancer CCRT with the aforementioned daily low-dose regimen, is a treatment with good patient compliance.",Excluded,0.17222416

1008,2246,"Review: Mucosal melanoma of the head and neck Head and neck mucosal melanoma (MM) is a rare and aggressive neoplasm, with high rates of local, regional, and distant failure. Owing to the small size of most reported series and their retrospective nature, and the lack of uniform comprehensive staging system, the effect of various treatment strategies on disease control and survival has been difficult to assess. The optimal management of head and neck MM is not well defined. Surgical treatment has being advocated as the primary treatment modality, with growing consideration for postoperative radiotherapy, as wide surgical resection in the head and neck region is often difficult. Radiotherapy is recently reported as a beneficial management modality, regardless of the fact that MM has been considered to be radioresistant. As significant morbidity is expected in high doses of radiotherapy to the head and neck region, new radiographic modalities with better precision are required. Furthermore, high-energy radiotherapy was suggested as a better therapy to mucosal MM due to the suggested biology of the tumor. The high rates of locoregional recurrence and distant metastasis also suggest that a systemic treatment is needed. Currently, there is no role for adjuvant systemic therapy for patients who have been successfully resected, but recent developments in the understanding of the biology of melanoma and, in particular, specific growth pathways holds promise for the future. We strongly recommend further evaluation of the role of chemotherapy and immunotherapy to decrease the rates of distant metastasis and improve survival. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded,0.176406
1009,2247,"Increased risk for vertebral fractures with long-term observation in mild primary hyperparathyroidism: Five year data from the scandinavian investigation of primary hyperparathyroidism (SIPH) Introduction Cohort studies using surrogate endpoints suggest decreased fracture risk after parathyroidectomy in patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), but long-term prospective studies are lacking. Here we report 5 year data on bone mineral density (BMD) and vertebral fracture (VF) incidence from the SIPH study1, where patients with PHPT were randomized to either parathyroidectomy (PTX) or observation (OBS). Methods Data were available from 130 patients (OBS n= 67, PTX n= 63) 5 years after randomization (mean age at inclusion 62 years, 9 men in each group). Baseline biochemistry (total Calcium (Ca), Parathyroid hormone (PTH), Creatinine) and BMD Z-scores by DXA (Z) for lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) were similar in the two groups. Lateral radiographs of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained at baseline, and after 2 and 5 years. Two radiologists, blinded to randomization and clinical data, evaluated the radiographs in consensus, using the semiquantitative method of Genant2 (including also L5). Results Basic biochemistry was stable in the OBS group, and normalized after parathyroidectomy (P< 0.001 for Ca and PTH). For the OBS group, baseline BMD Z in LS was -0.3 (IQR: -1.25 to +1.0) and in FN-0.2 (IQR: -0.9 to +0.5). After 5 years BMD Z in LS was-0.2 (IQR: -1.2 to +0.6) and in FN -0.6 (IQR: -1.0 to +0.1); not significant for both sites. For the PTX group, baseline BMD Z in LS was -0.2 (IQR: -1.0 to +1.0) and in FN -0.3 (IQR: 1.0 to +0.3). After 5 years BMD Z in LS increased to +0.4 (IQR: -0.7 to +1.2) and in FN to -0.2 (IQR: -0.7 to +0.4); P< 0.01 for both sites. The change in Z-scores (LS; FN) was different between OBS and PTX (P=0.04; P=0.013). At 5 years, X-rays were available for 110 patients (15 men) with baseline radiographs and at least one follow-up radiograph. Fifty-six patients were randomized to OBS (6 men) and 54 to PTX (9 men). Total follow-up time was 267.9 years (mean 4.8 years) in the OBS group and 271.5 years (mean 5.0 years) in the PTX group. There were 12 VFs in 10 patients (all women; 9.1% of all patients) at baseline (4 OBS patients with 6 VFs, 6 PTX patients with 6 VFs). During follow-up, 5 new VFs occurred in 5 patients (women), exclusively in the OBS group. Thus, 8.9% of the patients randomized to OBS, and none in the PTX group (P= 0.029), developed a new VF. Four of the new VFs occurred in patients with no VFs at baseline. All new VFs were of mild to moderate degree, and none had symptoms that could be related to the VF. Conclusion Five years after randomization, biochemistry and BMD Z-scores were stable with observation. Following parathyroidectomy biochemistry normalized and BMD Z-scores increased. New nonsymptomatic vertebral fractures developed in 5 females in the observation group, a significantly higher risk for fractures than following surgery.",Excluded,0.1812602
1015,2253,"The epicondylar ratio can be reliably used on X-ray of the knee to determine the joint line Purpose: The epicondylar ratio (ER) is used to restore the individual joint line (JL), especially in revision total knee arthroplasty. It was first described in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but is usually applied to a.p. radiographs of the knee for preoperative planning. The objective of the current study was to define reliable landmarks in MRI and X-ray images of the knee, which allow comparison of the image modalities. Furthermore, the correlation of the measured ER in MRI and X-rays of the knee was calculated. Method(s): A consecutive series of 87 patients who underwent an arthroscopical intervention of the knee were included into the present study. The lateral epicondyle was defined as the most lateral and distal prominence. On the medial side, the measurement was aligned to the epicondylar sulcus. The medial and lateral ER were calculated by dividing the perpendicular distance from the JL to the epicondyle by the transepicondylar distance. One observer determined the ER twice to calculate the intramethod intraobserver agreement, and a second observer obtained the intramethod interobserer agreement. The ER obtained from X-ray and MRI was compared to calculate the intermethod correlation. Result(s): The average lateral ER was 0.29 on X-ray versus 0.28 on MRI. The average medial ER was 0.33 and 0.33, respectively. Intramethod agreement ranged from 0.66 to 0.88 and intermethod correlation from 0.49 to 0.57. Conclusion(s): The ER can be determined reliably on MRI and X-ray images of the knee.

Concerns exist regarding the risk of contralateral nodal failure, particularly in patients with ipsilateral nodal involvement at presentation. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of patients treated with ipsilateral radiotherapy aiming to identify factors that predispose to a higher risk of contralateral nodal recurrence. Method(s): Retrospective case note review of all patients with tonsillar cancer who were treated using ipsilateral radiotherapy between September 1995 and September 2011 was performed. Demographics, T and N stage, involvement of soft palate and/or tongue base, presence of extra-capsular spread (ECS) and treatment details were recorded. Kaplan-Meier curves for treatment outcomes were generated. Result(s): A total of 136 patients were identified. Median follow-up was 4.2 years. Twelve (9%) patients had loco-regional recurrence. Eight patients (6%) had contralateral recurrence. N2b disease, ECS and number of pack-years of smoking were associated with contralateral nodal recurrence. Five-year overall survival was 89%, loco-regional disease-free survival 90%, disease-free survival 86% and distal recurrence-free survival 96%. Conclusion(s): N2b disease, ECS and a greater than 10 pack-year smoking history are risk factors for contralateral nodal recurrence in well-lateralised tonsillar cancers.

Focusing on the feasibility and prognosis of radiotherapy as an adjuvant or palliative treatment for osseous CE, this study investigated the outcome of Meriones meridianus with osseous CE after radiotherapy., Methods: The study utilized a comparison control group design with three groups of gerbils, and 240 osseous CE gerbils were randomly divided into control, 40Gy/5times, and 50Gy/5times groups. Different doses of radiotherapy were given to the gerbils, and then, the effects of radiotherapy on gerbils and lesions were observed at 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy. Statistical analysis was done using chi 2 test, unpaired t-test, and one-way ANOVA., Results: Significant changes (P < 0.05) were achieved between the three groups in terms of seven parameters at 3 and 6 months, including the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, number of dead scolices, protein content, Ca2+ concentration, the maximum diameter of lesion site, and wet weight of cysts. Except for the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, all other parameters were observed a big difference between 3 months and 6 months in the 50Gy/5times group., Conclusion: Radiotherapy at a dose of 50 Gy has inhibitory and therapeutic effects on osseous CE in gerbils, and radiotherapy could probably be a treatment option for persistent or recurrent osseous CE.

1039,2277,"Radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal melanoma metastases BACKGROUND: The role of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating metastatic melanoma involving the spine has previously been limited. Conventional external beam radiotherapy lacks the precision to allow delivery of large single-fraction doses of radiation and simultaneously to limit the dose delivered to radiosensitive structures such as the spinal cord. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of radiosurgery for the treatment of melanoma spinal metastases in 28 patients., METHODS: Thirty-six melanoma spine metastases were treated with a single-session radiosurgery technique (1 cervical, 11 thoracic, 13 lumbar, and 11 sacral) with a follow-up period of 3-43 months (median 13 months). Tumor volume ranged from 4.1 to 153 cm3 (mean 47.6 cm3). Twenty-three of the 36 lesions had received prior external beam irradiation., RESULTS: Maximum tumor dose was maintained at 17.5-25 Gy (mean 21.7 Gy). Spinal cord volume receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 0.7 cm3 (mean 0.26 cm3); spinal canal volume at the cauda equina level receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 3.5 cm3 (mean 0.98 cm3). No radiation-induced toxicity occurred during the follow-up period. Axial and radicular pain improved in 27 of 28 patients (96%) who were treated primarily for pain. Long-term tumor control was seen in 3 of 4 cases treated primarily for radiographic tumor progression. Two patients went on to require open surgical intervention for tumor progression resulting in neurological deficit., CONCLUSIONS: Spinal radiosurgery offers a therapeutic modality for the safe delivery of large dose fractions of radiation therapy in a single fraction for the management of spinal metastases in patients with advanced melanoma that are often poorly controlled with alternative conventional external beam radiation therapy, and is successful even in patients with previously irradiated lesions.

1040,2278,"Prospective evaluation of a dedicated spine radiosurgery program using the Elekta Synergy S system Cone beam CT (CBCT) image guidance has recently been adopted for the delivery of spine radiosurgery. In 2007, the authors' institution began a dedicated spine radiosurgery program using the Elekta Synergy S system, which incorporates CBCT technology. In this study, the authors prospectively evaluated the Synergy S platform as a dedicated spine radiosurgery delivery system, including an evaluation of the accuracy of patient positioning using this technology, as part of a quality assurance program. One hundred sixty-six spine and paraspinal lesions were treated using the Elekta Synergy S 6-MV LINAC with a beam modulator and CBCT image guidance combined with a HexaPOD couch that allows correction of patient positioning in 3 translational and 3 rotational directions. Stratifying the lesion by location, there were 28 cervical, 69 thoracic, 48 lumbar, and 21 sacral lesions. The most common histological types for the metastatic lesions (136 cases total) were breast, lung, sarcomas, and renal cells. The most common benign tumors (30 cases total) included 10 schwannomas, 5 neurofibromas, and 5 meningiomas. Twenty-eight lesions (17%) were intradural. To measure intratreatment patient movement, 3 quality assurance CBCTs were performed and recorded at separate times: immediately before treatment started; at the first third of the procedure; and at the second third of the procedure. The positioning data and fused images of the planning CT and CBCT were analyzed to determine intrafraction patient movements. From each of 3 quality assurance CBCT images, 3 translational and 3 rotational coordinates were obtained. The prescribed dose to the gross tumor volume, delivered in a single fraction, ranged from 12 to 20 Gy (mean 16 Gy) in this cohort. This dose was delivered by between 7 and 14 coplanar intensity-modulated radiation therapy beams (mean 9 beams). The gross tumor volumes ranged from 1.2 to 491.7 cm(3) (mean 39.2 cm(3)). Mean treatment time including setup was 64 minutes. At the first third of the treatment, the magnitude of the 3D translational vector (X, Y, Z) was 1.1 +/- 0.7 mm. Similarly, the 3D translational vector at the second third of the treatment was 1.0 +/- 0.6 mm. The means +/- SDs of the rotational angles were 0.2degree +/- 0.4degree, 0.4degree +/- 0.5degree, and 0.3degree +/- 0.5degree along yaw, roll, and pitch, respectively, at the first third of the treatment, and 0.2degree +/- 0.3degree, 0.4degree +/- 0.5degree, and 0.4degree +/- 0.5degree, respectively, at the second third of the treatment.

The aim of this first study on patients was to determine the radiation exposure of organs at risk and assess the risk for late effects including secondary tumors and/or hereditary disorders after stereotactic Linac radiosurgery., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) measurements were done on 21 consecutively admitted patients with various intracranial lesions scheduled for Linac radiosurgery. The TLD chips were placed on the eyelid, thyroid, breast and the regions of the ovary or testes., RESULTS: The mean doses in organs at risk were 276 +/- 200 mGy (eye lens), 155 +/- 83 mGy (thyroid), 47 +/- 22 mGy (breast), 20 +/- 12 mGy (ovary), and 9 +/- 3 mGy (testes). The doses decreased significantly with a larger distance from the isocenter., CONCLUSION: The absorbed doses to the extracranial organs at risk in patients undergoing Linac radiosurgery were very low, ranging from 0.025% (testes) to 0.76% (eye lens) of the mean maximum target dose (36 Gy). Nevertheless, while the majority of radiosurgery patients have benign tumors or arteriovenous malformations and their life expectancy is long, all doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable.

The objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of body mass index (BMI) on dose, diagnostic performance, and image quality of a low-dose CT examination for renal colic. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included all patients who underwent a low-dose CT examination for renal colic performed during the year 2012 with automatic tube current modulation, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction, and a low tube voltage (kV). Three readers independently reviewed all images for the presence of renal colic and evaluated diagnostic confidence and image quality. The results and doses were compared among patients grouped by body mass index (BMI) and between patients with a BMI < 25 and those with a BMI >= 25. RESULTS. Eighty-six patients were included in the study: 39 patients had a BMI < 25 and 47 had a BMI >= 25. No statistically significant difference was found between the accuracy rates for the diagnosis of renal colic when the rates of the three independent readers were averaged for both BMI groups (95.7% vs 96.4%, respectively; p = 0.83). Image quality and diagnostic confidence scores were significantly better for patients with a BMI >= 25 than for patients with a BMI < 25 (mean image quality score, 3.7 vs 3.4, p < 0.001; mean diagnostic confidence score, 2.8 vs 2.5, p < 0.001). The mean radiation dose for patients with a BMI < 25 was 2.4 mGy compared with 3.7 mGy for patients with a BMI >= 25 ( p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. The diagnostic performance of our low-dose CT protocol for renal colic was excellent for all patients, and image quality and diagnostic confidence were significantly better for patients with a BMI >= 25.

MRI workers are occupationally exposed to static and time-varying gradient magnetic fields. While the 24-hour time-averaged exposure to static magnetic fields is about a few mT, the maximum static field strength can be as high as 500 mT during patient setup. Over the past several years, our laboratory has performed extensive experiments on the health effects of exposure of animal models and humans to different sources of electromagnetic fields such as cellular phones, mobile base stations, mobile phone jammers, laptop computers, radars, dentistry cavitrons and MRI. This study is to investigate the adverse health effects in MRI workers and also to assess the effect of exposure of MRI workers to static magnetic fields on their cognitive functions. In the first phase of this study a questionnaire was designed to collect information from 120 MRI personnel. The collection of data about the adverse health effects was based on self-reporting by the participants. In the second phase, 47 volunteer university students were asked to continuously move around a 1.5 T MRI scanner. Visual reaction time and working memory tests were performed on all participants before and after the experiment. Forward digit span and backward digit span were used for assessing the working memory. Furthermore, participants were asked to report the symptoms they had experienced during the movement. The first phase of our study showed increased frequencies of adverse health effects in MRI workers. In this study the rates of self-reported symptoms such as a headache, sleep problems, myalgia, palpitation, fatigue, concentration problems, attention problems, nervousness and backpain were possibly affected by static magnetic field. Furthermore we found that reaction time and working memory could be influenced by the movements of the body around a MRI scanner. It can be concluded that movement through a high magnetic field can also lead to some adverse cognitive effects in MRI staff.Copyright © 2018, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

1049,2287,"Congenital coronary anomalies detected by coronary computed tomography compared to invasive coronary angiography BACKGROUND: As coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has emerged as a non-invasive alternative for evaluation of coronary anatomy with a lower referral threshold than invasive coronary angiography (ICA), the prevalence of coronary anomalies in CCTA may more closely reflect the true prevalence in the general population. Morphological features of coronary anomalies can be evaluated more precisely by CCTA than by ICA, which might lead to a higher identification of congenital coronary anomalies in CCTA compared to ICA.To evaluate the incidence, clinical and morphological features of the anatomy of patients with coronary anomalies detected either by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with prospective ECG-triggering or invasive coronary angiography (ICA)., METHODS: Consecutive patients underwent 64-slice CCTA (n = 1'759) with prospective ECG-triggering or ICA (n = 9'782) and coronary anatomy was evaluated for identification of coronary anomalies to predefined criteria (origin, course and termination) according to international recommendations., RESULTS: The prevalence of coronary anomalies was 7.9% (n = 138) in CCTA and 2.1% in ICA (n = 203; p < 0.01). The most commonly coronary anomaly detected by CCTA was myocardial bridging 42.8% (n = 59) vs. 21.2% (n = 43); p < 0.01, while with ICA an absent left main trunk was the most observed anomaly 36.0% (n = 73; p < 0.01). In 9.4% (n = 13) of identified coronary anomalies in CCTA 9.4% were potentially serious coronary anaomalies, defined as a course of the coronary artery between aorta and pulmonary artery were identified., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of coronary anomalies is substantially higher with CCTA than ICA even after exclusion of patients with myocardial bridging which is more frequently found with CCTA. This suggests that the true prevalence of coronary anomalies in the general population may have been underestimated based on ICA.",Excluded,0.17313053
1051,2289,"Lower body negative pressure counters posture induced increases of intraocular pressure and intracranial pressure Purpose: Recent ophthalmic evaluations of seven astronauts after six-month missions to International Space Station show unexpected vision impairment. In addition, lumbar punctures in four astronauts with optic disc edema showed moderate elevations of cerebral spinal fluid pressure after returning to Earth. This Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) syndrome is likely related to a headward body fluid shift that elevates intracranial pressure (ICP). We hypothesized that a moderate level of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) would counteract head down, body-tilt, induced elevations in IOP and ICP. Method(s): Twenty-five normal healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in this study (mean age: 31 years). Right and left IOP, ICP (non-invasive ultrasound pulsed phase locked loop), arm blood pressure, and heart rate were measured during the last minute of each testing condition. Subjects were positioned supine (5 mins), sitting (5 mins), 15-degrees head-down tilt (HDT) (5 mins) and ten minutes of HDT with LBNP (25 mmHg). The order of HDT and HDT+LBNP tests were balanced. The right and left IOP values were averaged and used for statistical analysis (significance accepted at p<0.05). Data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation. The change from supine was calculated for IOP values. Result(s): IOP significantly decreased from supine to sitting posture by 3.2 +/- 1.4 mmHg, and increased by 0.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg from supine to the HDT position. LBNP during head-down-tilt significantly lowered IOP to supine levels (difference from supine, 0.3 +/- 1.1 mmHg). In addition, added LBNP during HDT significantly decreased ICP-related pulse amplitudes of transcranial ultrasound waveforms by 2.1+/-3.4 microns (n=9). Mean blood pressure and heart rate did not change significantly across all conditions. Conclusion(s): These data demonstrate that short duration exposures to HDT increase IOP and ICP significantly and further, that LBNP counteracts these elevations of IOP and ICP. Therefore, spaceflight countermeasures that shift fluid to lower body may mitigate vision problems.",Excluded,0.17284833
1052,2290,"Palliation of dysphagia in advanced, metastatic or recurrent carcinoma oesophagus with high dose rate intraluminal brachytherapy - An eastern Indian experience of 35 cases Oesophageal cancer, a disease with high morbidity and mortality, has a relatively high incidence in eastern India, usually presenting at advanced stage. The main aim of treatment for majority of patients remains palliation of dysphagia, which can be effectively done by intraluminal brachytherapy with or without external radiotherapy. Between January 2006 to January 2010 a total of 35 patients with advanced/metastatic (24/35) or recurrent (11/35) oesophageal carcinoma were treated with intraluminalhigh dose rate (HDR) iridium192 source brachytherapy at Medical College Hospitals, Kolkata. Selection for palliative brachytherapy includes one or more of the following criteria: Lesion more than 5 cm long on imaging studies or upper GI endoscopy, Karnofsky performance status <50%, Locoregional recurrence. Palliative external radiotherapy (20Gy/5# or 30 Gy/10#) was given to 11 patients (31.42%) before brachytherapy. All patients treated with 2 fractions of high dose rate-intraluminal brachytherapy (HDRILRT) one week apart with 600 cGy per fraction at 1 cm off axis. Thirty-five patients were treated with palliative HDR-ILRT. Significant improvement in swallowing status was seen in 20 patients (57.14%) since just after treatment up to 7.5 months. However, 9 patients (25.71%) showed no improvement, and 6 patients (17.14%) showed no changes in dysphagia scoring. Only 3 patients developed ulceration and 2 developed fistula immediately after treatment and 5 patients developed stricture. Median dysphagiafree survival was 6 months. Median overall survival was 8 months. It is concluded that intraluminal brachytherapy is an effective method for palliation of dysphagia for reasonably prolonged period.",Excluded,0.17304434
1054,2292,"Evolution of coronary computed tomography radiation dose reduction at a tertiary referral center Purpose: We aimed to assess the temporal change in radiation doses from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) during a 6-year period. High CCTA radiation doses have been reduced by multiple technologies that, if used appropriately, can decrease exposures significantly. Method(s): A total of 1277 examinations performed from 2005 to 2010 were included. Univariate and multivariable regression analysis of patient- and scan-related variables was performed with estimated radiation dose as the main outcome measure. Result(s): Median doses decreased by 74.8% (P <.001), from 13.1 millisieverts (mSv) (interquartile range 9.3-14.7) in period 1 to 3.3 mSv (1.8-6.7) in period 4. Factors associated with greatest dose reductions (P <.001) were all most frequently applied in period 4: axial-sequential acquisition (univariate: -8.0 mSv [-9.7 to -7.9]), high-pitch helical acquisition (univariate: -8.8 mSv [-9.3 to -7.9]), reduced tube voltage (100 vs 120 kV) (univariate: -6.4 mSv [-7.4 to -5.4]), and use of automatic exposure control (univariate: -5.3 mSv [-6.2 to -4.4]). Conclusion(s): CCTA radiation doses were reduced 74.8% through increasing use of dose-saving measures and evolving scanner technology. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.17242184
1056,2294,"Clinical implementation of an emergency department coronary computed tomographic angiography protocol for triage of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome Objectives: To evaluate the efficiency and safety of emergency department (ED) coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) during a 3-year clinical experience. Method(s): Single-center registry of coronary CTA in consecutive ED patients with suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The primary outcome was efficiency of coronary CTA defined as the length of hospitalization. Secondary endpoints of safety were defined as the rate of downstream testing, normalcy rates of invasive coronary angiography (ICA), absence of missed ACS, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during follow-up, and index radiation exposure. Result(s): One thousand twenty two consecutive patients were referred for clinical coronary CTA with suspicion of ACS. Overall, median time to discharge home was 10.5 (5.7-24.1) hours. Patient disposition was 42.7 % direct discharge from the ED, 43.2 % discharge from emergency unit, and 14.1 % hospital admission. ACS rate during index hospitalization was 9.1 %. One hundred ninety two patients underwent additional diagnostic imaging and 77 underwent ICA. The positive predictive value of CTA compared to ICA was 78.9 % (95 %-CI 68.1-87.5 %). Median CT radiation exposure was 4.0 (2.5-5.8) mSv. No ACS was missed; MACE at follow-up after negative CTA was 0.2 %. Conclusion(s): Coronary CTA in an experienced tertiary care setting allows for efficient and safe management of patients with suspicion for ACS. Key points: * ED Coronary CTA using advanced systems is associated with low radiation exposure. * Negative coronary CTA is associated with low rates of MACE. * CTA in ED patients enables short median time to discharge home. * CTA strategy is characterized by few downstream tests including unnecessary ICA.Copyright © 2016, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded,0.17104606
1058,2296,"Atypical radiation toxicity in patients with classical Kaposi's sarcoma The classical (non-AIDS-related) form of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) typically affects older patients of Eastern European or Mediterranean ethnic background. Although radiotherapy is a standard part of the treatment armamentarium for KS patients, a high incidence of radiotoxicity has been reported in epidemic AIDS-related cases. In order to determine whether this radiotoxicity is observed only in patients with the epidemic form of the disease, we have conducted a retrospective chart review of 30 patients with classical KS treated with radiation for whom follow-up information was available. Seven out of 30 (23%) were found to have unexpectedly high levels of radiotoxicity after tumor doses of 22-42 Gy. This toxicity consisted either of significantly increased edema or chronic skin breakdown and severe radiodermatitis, in some cases requiring multiple surgical corrective procedures. We suggest that the abnormal lymphaticovenous development and chronic lymphokine stimulation associated with KS of both epidemic and classical forms may be responsible in part for the observed radiotoxicity.",Excluded,0.8655211
1059,2297,"Pulmonary nodules detected at lung cancer screening: Interobserver variability of semiautomated volume measurements Purpose: To retrospectively determine interobserver variability of semiautomated volume measurements of pulmonary nodules and the potential reasons for variability. Material(s) and Method(s): The Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening trial (NELSON) is a lung cancer screening study that includes men between the ages of 50 and 75 years who are current or former heavy smokers. The NELSON project was approved by the Dutch Ministry of Health and the ethics committee of each participating hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. For this study, the authors evaluated 1200 consecutive low-dose computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest obtained during the NELSON project and identified subjects who had at least one 50-500-mm3 nodule. One local and one central observer independently evaluated the scans and measured the volume of any detected nodule by using semiautomated software. Noncalcified solid nodules with volumes of 15-500 mm3 were included in this study if they were fully surrounded by air (intraparenchymal) and were detected by both observers. The mean volume and the difference between both measurements were calculated for all nodules. Intermeasurement agreement was assessed with the Spearman correlation coefficient. Potential reasons for discrepancies were assessed. Result(s): There were 232 men (mean age, 60 years; age range, 52-73 years) with 430 eligible nodules (mean volume, 77.8 mm3; range, 15.3-499.5 mm3). Interobserver correlation was high (r = 0.99). No difference in volume was seen for 383 nodules (89.1%). Discrepant results were obtained for 47 nodules (10.9%); in 16 cases (3.7%), the discrepancy was larger than 10%. The most frequent cause of variability was incomplete segmentation due to an irregular shape or irregular margins. Conclusion(s): In a minority (approximately 11%) of small solid intraparenchymal nodules, semiautomated measurements are not completely reproducible and, thus, may cause errors in the assessment of nodule growth. For small or irregularly shaped nodules, an observer should check the segmentation shown by the program. © RSNA, 2006.",Excluded,0.17446646
1062,2300,"Pulmonary emphysema: radiation dose and section thickness at multidetector CT quantification--comparison with macroscopic and microscopic morphometry PURPOSE: To prospectively investigate the effects of radiation dose and section thickness on quantitative multidetector computed tomographic (CT) indexes of pulmonary emphysema., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Seventy patients (49 men, 21 women; age range, 38-79 years) referred for surgical resection of a lung tumor underwent multidetector CT with 4 x 1-mm collimation, 120 kVp, and 20 and 120 effective mAs. At each radiation dose, 1.25-, 5.0-, and 10.0-mm-thick sections were reconstructed at 10-mm intervals. From scans of the lobe or whole lung to be resected, relative areas (RAs) of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than nine thresholds and eight percentiles of the distribution of attenuation coefficients were compared with the histopathologic extent of emphysema, which was measured microscopically--by using the corrected mean interwall distance (MIWD) and the corrected mean perimeter (MP)--and macroscopically. Correlations between the data obtained by using attenuation thresholds and percentiles and the parameters macroscopic extent of emphysema, MIWD, and MP were investigated by using Spearman coefficients., RESULTS: The 1st percentile (r range, -0.394 to -0.675; P < .001) and attenuation coefficients of -980, -970, and -960 HU (r range, 0.478-0.664; P < .001) yielded the strongest correlations with macroscopic extent, MIWD, and MP, regardless of radiation dose or section thickness. The effects of radiation dose and section thickness on RAs of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than -960 HU (P = .007 and P < .001, respectively) and lower than -970 HU (P = .001 and P < .001, respectively) were significant. The effect of section thickness on the 1st percentile was significant (P < .001), whereas the effect of dose was not (P = .910)., CONCLUSION: At CT quantification of pulmonary emphysema, the tube current-time product can be reduced to 20 mAs, but both tube current-time product and section thickness should be kept constant in follow-up examinations.",Excluded,0.17512372
1063,2301,"Statistical modeling of carcinogenic risks in dogs that inhaled 238PuO2 Combined analyses of data on 260 life-span beagle dogs that inhaled 238PuO2 at the Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute (ITRI) and at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) were conducted. The hazard functions (age-specific risks) for incidence of lung, bone and liver tumors were modeled as a function of cumulative radiation dose, and estimates of lifetime risks based on the combined data were developed. For lung tumors, linear-quadratic functions provided an adequate fit to the data from both laboratories, and linear functions provided an adequate fit when analyses were restricted to doses less than 20 Gy. The estimated risk coefficients for these functions were significantly larger when based on ITRI data compared to PNNL data, and dosimetry biases are a possible explanation for this difference. There was also evidence that the bone tumor response functions differed for the two laboratories, although these differences occurred primarily at high doses. These functions were clearly nonlinear (even when restricted to average skeletal doses less than 1 Gy), and evidence of radiation-induced bone tumors was found for doses less than 0.5 Gy in both laboratories. Liver tumor risks were similar for the two laboratories, and linear functions provided an adequate fit to these data. Lifetime risk estimates for lung and bone tumors derived from these data had wide confidence intervals, but were consistent with estimates currently used in radiation protection. The dog-based lifetime liver tumor risk estimate was an order of magnitude larger than that used in radiation protection, but the latter also carries large uncertainties. The application of common statistical methodology to data from two studies has allowed the identification of differences in these studies and has provided a basis for common risk estimates based on both data sets.",Excluded,0.9234288
1067,2305,"Radiation-associated changes in the length of telomeres in peripheral leukocytes from inpatients with cancer Purpose: The telomere length of somatic cells shortens with age and with other endogenous and exogenous pathogenic factors. However, the effects of radiation therapy on telomere DNA of non-cancer tissue have not been thoroughly investigated. This study analyzed the telomere length of inpatients with cancer treated with radiation therapy to see whether the telomere lengths change in response to therapeutic radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-five patients were enrolled in the study. The patients had lung cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatoma, or rectal cancer. They received radiation therapy with a dose range of 15-74 Gy. The telomere lengths and telomere length distribution in peripheral leukocytes were analyzed by using a Southern blot-based method. Result(s): The telomere length and the telomere length distribution of the peripheral leukocytes did not change after radiation therapy. However, there was a significant proportional decrease in the short telomere fraction (< 4.4 kb) per day and per Gy. Conclusion(s): This observation suggested that the telomere length distribution of peripheral leukocytes could be affected by radiation therapy, and that the effect of radiation tends to appear in cells with short telomeres. Radiation therapy-associated somatic telomere length change within a short range of time, about three months or shorter, can be detected by analyzing the mean telomere length and telomere length distribution. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded,0.95694375

Method(s): In this study we evaluated 21 patients (8 female and 13 male) clinically and radiologically 10 years postoperative and compared them with the same group of 28 patients we operated between August 2002 and August 2003 for traumatic vertebral fractures type A with balloon kyphoplasty and CPC. Over the 10 years 7 patients were untraceable. 3 of them were not clinically impaired but didn't want to participate in the study and 4 patients we didn't found. All 21 patients underwent standard X-ray (standing) and a CT. We measured the volume of the cement, the resorption the last 10 years and the disc height in the CT and the segmental and vertebral kyphosis angle in the X ray and compared them with the X-ray (standing) and CT done directly postoperatively. To assess the pain level we used the VAS, ODI score, Roland Morris score and the Denis work scale and compared them with the same scores we recorded in the past. Result(s): The VAS score demonstrated an increase over time from a mean of 1 (0-5) at the 2 year follow up to 2.3 (0-8) at the 10 years follow up. The Roland Morris disability score also increased over time from 2 (0-8) 2 years postoperative to a mean of 3.6 (0-18) at the 10 years follow up. We recognized no complications and no reoperations were necessary. We recognized an increase of the median value for the vertebral kyphosis angle about 1degree (0degree - 4degree). The median value of the disc height diminution over the 10 years was 0.7 mm (0 - 3.9). For the anterior wall of the fractured VB the decrease of the median value was about 1 mm (0-3) and for the posterior wall it was 0 mm (0-2). So the Beck Index decreased from 0.80 (0.65 - 0.97) to 0.77 (0.62 - 0.97) at the 10 year follow up which means a decrease of the median value of 0.03 (0 - 0.07). We noticed a median value for the cement volume of 4.2 cc (2.0-8.6) postoperative and at the 10 year follow up of 3.2 cc (1.3-7.8) which means a resorption of the cement volume about 22.9 % (0.8 % - 55.5 %). Conclusion(s): In our 10 year follow up we didn't recognize any significant loss of correction of the vertebral and segmental kyphosis angle. We also didn't recognized a significant diminution of the disc height without degeneration of the disc over the last 10 years. There was a partial resorption of the cement but not as much as we expected with variable bone formation. In summary the long follow up about 10 years of kyphoplasty show us very good clinical and radiological results and in our opinion we consider this to be a treatment option for traumatic selected vertebral type A fractures also in young patients.",Excluded,0.17239928

Information on LA volume is available on contrast-enhanced electrocardiogram (EGC)-gated multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scans., OBJECTIVE: To assess interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility of 3-dimensional threshold-based volume (3DTV) and 2-dimensional (2D) measurements for the assessment of LA volumes with contrast-enhanced cardiac 64-slice MDCT., METHODS: Contrast-enhanced 64-slice MDCT (0.6-mm slice thickness, 120 kVp, 850 mAseff) was performed in 96 consecutive subjects (mean age 52 years; 48% women) as a subset of the Rule Out Myocardial Infarction using Computer Assisted Tomography trial. Two observers independently measured maximal (LAV(max)) and minimal (LAV(min)) LA volumes with (1) a modified Simpson's method (3DTV) based on delineation of LA areas in axial slices and (2) estimated LA volumes typically used in 2D echocardiography (area length and prolate ellipse). Interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility for each method as well as correlations between the methods were calculated., RESULTS: Interobserver (n = 96) and intraobserver (n = 20) variability was significantly lower for 3DTV (8%) than for area length (13%; P < 0.001) or prolate ellipse (16%; P < 0.001). 2D-based measurements rendered significantly lower LA volumes than did 3DTV (area length: -17% and -22%; prolate ellipse: -43% and -46% for LAV(max) and LAV(min), respectively; P < 0.001 for all). By 3DTV, mean LA volume was 90.4 +/- 24.5 mL for LAV(max) and 52.5 +/- 17.6 mL for LAV(min)., CONCLUSION: ECG-gated contrast-enhanced cardiac MDCT offers volumetric assessment of LA volume with excellent reproducibility without additional contrast administration or radiation exposure. 3D measures of LA volume are more reproducible and render larger volumes than 2D-derived estimates, typically used in echocardiography.",Excluded,0.17092636

The fistula rate for patients who underwent immediate PMMC flap was 28.6%, intermediate to primary closure and PMMF flap. Several factors were evaluated for relationship to fistula, but no significant associations were identified. However, patients with fistula tended to have longer inpatient stays and may have been more likely to have a history of cardiovascular or hypoxic disease., Conclusion: Pharyngocutaneous fistula is a well-established complication of total laryngectomy and is especially a concern in patients with a previous history of radiation. Our retrospective review demonstrates that PMMF onlay flap appears to be more effective in reducing the rate of fistula compared to primary closure in these patients. Myocutaneous augmentation flaps, in contrast, have a fairly high fistula rate and may be better replaced with alternative closures such as free flaps.Copyright © 2013 The American Laryngological.",Excluded,0.17574924

1073,2311,"Radiotherapy for benign head and neck paragangliomas: A 45-year experience BACKGROUND: Paragangliomas of the head and neck are rare, slow-growing, generally benign tumors of neuroendocrine cells associated with the peripheral nervous system that commonly involve the carotid body, jugular bulb, vagal ganglia, and temporal bone. Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy (RT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and observation. This article briefly reviews our 45-year institutional experience treating this neoplasm with RT., METHODS: From January 1968 through March 2011, 131 patients with 156 benign paragangliomas of the temporal bone, carotid body, jugular bulb, or glomus vagale were treated with RT at a median dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions. The mean and median follow-up times were 11.5 years and 8.7 years, respectively., RESULTS: Five tumors (3.2%) recurred locally after RT, all within 10 years of treatment. The overall local control rates at 5 and 10 years were 99% and 96%, respectively. The cause-specific survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 98% and 97%, respectively. The distant-metastasis free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 99% and 99%, respectively. The overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 91% and 72%, respectively. There were no severe complications., CONCLUSION: RT for benign head and neck paragangliomas is a safe and efficacious treatment associated with minimal morbidity. Surgery is reserved for patients in good health whose risk of associated morbidity is low. SRS may be suitable for patients with skull base tumors <3 cm where RT is logistically unsuitable. Observation is a reasonable option for asymptomatic patients with a limited life expectancy.Copyright © 2014 American Cancer Society.",Excluded,0.18205658
1080,2318,"The epidemiology of vitamin D and colorectal cancer: recent findings PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight the human studies published over the past year examining the influence of vitamin D on risk of colorectal cancer., RECENT FINDINGS: Studies over the past year have added more support to the idea that higher levels of vitamin D may decrease risk of colorectal cancer. Further, typical dietary intakes such as 200-400 IU/day may be too low to exert appreciable benefits, and protection may occur with higher levels of vitamin D associated with exposure to sunshine. Recent studies also suggest a potential benefit of vitamin D on other digestive-tract cancers, and that vitamin D status at the time of diagnosis and treatment may influence survival of cancer. However, the evidence for these latter findings is based on limited data and needs to be confirmed. Higher vitamin D levels may also be associated with a higher rate of apoptosis in colorectal mucosa., SUMMARY: Recent studies add more support to a potential role of vitamin D on risk of colorectal cancer, but suggest that intakes higher than customary are required if solar ultraviolet-B exposure is low. More studies are required to determine the optimal levels and intakes of this vitamin to reduce cancer risk. Potential benefits of vitamin D on other digestive-tract cancers and on survival in patients with colorectal cancer have been suggested by recent studies, but require confirmation.",Excluded,0.1811501

Nowadays, little is known about the influence of different screw types and amount of cement applied. This single-center retrospective observational study has the aim of evaluating the middle- to long-term mechanical performances of different types of screws in elderly patients with thoracolumbar fractures. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 91 patients (37 males and 54 females), treated between 2011 and 2016, affected by somatic osteoporotic fractures aged over 65 years were treated. We divided patients into three different populations: solid screws, cannulated screws and cannulated screws augmented with poly methyl methacrylate cement (PMMA). Patients were radiologically evaluated with X-rays in pre- and post-surgery and at the follow-up (FU). Clinical evaluations were made with VAS and Oswestry Disability Index. Result(s): A total of 636 screws were implanted (222 pedicle screws, 190 cannulated and 224 cannulated screws with PMMA augmentation). At FU, we found significative differences between populations in terms of mechanical performances. We founded five cases of loosening; these were reported in solid screws group and in cannulated screws one. No mechanical failures were reported in cannulated screws with augmentation of PMMA. No rods breakage cases were reported. Conclusion(s): All stabilization methods showed good clinical results, but cannulated screws augmented with PMMA seem to provide better implant stability with the lowest rate of loosening.

1084,2322,"Evaluation and management of pericardial effusion in patients with neoplastic disease The incidence and extent of pericardial involvement in neoplastic disease varies. In a considerable number of patients with breast or lung cancer or with mediastinal lymphoma, in addition to direct involvement by the tumor, radiation therapy as well as systemic tumor treatment can also lead to pericardial effusion. In addition, in immunosuppressed tumor patients, pericardial effusion can also arise from viral, bacterial, and autoimmune causes. To distinguish between these 3 different conditions leading to pericardial effusion, the diagnosis should be based on pericardiocentesis followed by fluid analysis for cytology and biomarkers, on epicardial and pericardial biopsy facilitated by flexible pericardioscopy with analysis of specimens by conventional histology and molecular biology techniques for viral and microbial aetiology. We collected prospectively but analyzed retrospectively 357 patients undergoing pericardiocentesis from 1988 to 2008 and identified 68 patients who had cancer-related pericardial effusion. With these methods, 42 patients demonstrated malignant effusion, 15 patients had radiation-induced pericardial, effusion, and in 11 patients without radiation therapy, the effusion could be attributed to either viral infection in 5 cases or to an autoimmune process in the remaining 6 patients. Consequently, intrapericardial treatment could be tailored for each cohort: neoplastic effusion was treated with intrapericardial cisplatin (single instillation of 30 mg/m(2) per 24 hours); in addition to the tumor-specific systemic chemotherapy, intrapericardial triamcinolone acetate (Volon A) was given in a dose of 500 mg/m(2) in the patients with autoimmune and radiation-induced effusion. Saline rinsing and intrapericardial sclerosing treatment were the treatment of choice in viral pericardial effusion. Oral colchicine treatment (2-3 x 0.5 mg) was given in all patients for at least 3 months. Recurrence of pericardial effusion was prevented for at least 3 months in more than 85% of patients. This differential diagnostic approach and the results of treatment were compared with published series. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.17196724
1085,2323,"Increased incidence of haematological cancer among physicians in a University Hospital OBJECTIVES: The oral report of eight cases of cancer over a period of 3 years among physicians working in a French University Hospital led us to conduct a retrospective cohort study to compare the incidence of cancer in these physicians with that of the general population living in the same area., METHOD: The cohort consisted of 940 physicians (72% male, 28% female) who had worked for at least 1 year in this hospital between 1945 and 1994 (a total of 10,693 person-years). The incidence of cancer among physicians was compared with that of the general population using a local cancer registry which has recorded all cancer cases occurring in the Department between 1979 and 1994. Standardised incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated for all causes of cancer and site by site., RESULTS: Although the global incidence of cancer did not differ from that of the general population (SIR=0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59-1.5), a significantly increased incidence of haematological malignancy was found among physicians (SIR=5.45; 95% CI 2-11.9)., CONCLUSIONS: These findings pointed out the risk of lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer among physicians who started working after 1945 when the first rules pertaining to protection from ionising radiation came into effect. However, limitations of this study such as limited statistical power and lack of individual exposure data should be considered in the interpretation of these findings. Possible aetiological factors responsible for these risks are discussed. Education about general safety protection programmes against carcinogenic risk factors including physical, biological and chemical agents still remains a priority among physicians.",Excluded,0.72997123

1087,2325,"A randomized trial comparing dual axis rotational versus conventional coronary angiography in a population with a high prevalence of coronary artery disease OBJECTIVES: To compare the safety, radiation dose, and contrast volume between dual axis rotational coronary angiography (DARCA) and conventional coronary angiography (CCA)., BACKGROUND: CCA is performed in multiple, predefined stationary views, at different angulations around the patient, for both the left and right coronary arteries. DARCA (AlluraXperSwing TM, Philips, the Netherlands) involves a pre-set rotation of the C-arm around the patient and allows for the visualization of each coronary artery in different views, using a single automatic pump contrast injection., METHODS: From November 2012 to February 2013, 201 patients were randomly assigned to either CCA (n = 100) or DARCA (n = 101). Exclusion criteria included acute coronary syndrome (ACS), prior PCI or CABG. CCAs were performed in 4 acquisition runs for the left coronary artery and 2 to 3 acquisition runs for the right coronary artery, whereas DARCAs were performed in a single run for each coronary artery., RESULTS: Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar for both groups. The overall prevalence of CAD was 77.6%. The DARCA group had a significant reduction in the amount of contrast, 60 ml (IQR: 52.5-71.5 ml) versus 76 ml (IQR: 68-87 ml), P < 0.0001; and radiation dose by Air Kerma, 269.5 mGy (IQR: 176-450.5) versus 542.1 mGy (IQR: 370.7-720.8), P < 0.0001. There were fewer patients requiring additional projections in the DARCA group: 54.0% versus 75.0%; P = 0.002., CONCLUSIONS: In a population with a high prevalence of CAD, DARCA was safe and resulted in a significant decrease in contrast volume and radiation dose.

1091,2329,"Combined use of TUR and laser ablation in the treatment of bladder cancer Introduction: Superficial bladder cancer (SBC) tends to recur (30 80%) after transurethral resection (TUR) of the bladder wall. The aim of the study was a comparative analysis of efficacy of standard TUR and combined use of TUR and laser ablation in the treatment of patients with SBC. Material(s) and Method(s): 60 patients (male 41, female 19) with SBC were treated in the urological clinic of Saratov State Medical University. The age of the patients varied between 43 and 80 years (mean 60.7+/-0.5). The primary bladder tumor was registered in 47 patients, 13 patients were hospitalized due to relapse of a disease. In clinical and morphological investigations transitional cell carcinoma in the stage Ta T1N0M0G1 2 was diagnosed. All patients were divided into two groups. In 23 patients of the first group, standard TUR was applied with use of KARL STORZ Endoscope. In the second group, TUR was combined with consecutive noncontact irradiation of the tumor bed and adjacent area (1 cm2) by the light of Nd:YAG laser (""Sharplan"", lambda 1,064 nm, power 65W, total energy 20-40 kJ). Result(s): In the first group, 6 patients had relapse of the bladder cancer during the first year, and total number of patients with relapse was 7 (30.4% cases). Accordingly three years recurrence free survival rate was 69.6% in the first group. In the second group, relapse rate was only 10.8% and three years recurrence free period was 89.2%. Difference between the groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05).

1092,2330,"A pilot study of continuous, hyperfractionated, accelerated radiotherapy in rectal adenocarcinoma This pilot study investigated the feasibility, toxicity and effect of continuous, hyperfractionated, accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) in 19 patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum who were treated at Mount Vernon Hospital between April 1992 and April 1994. A total dose of 54 Gy was given in 36 fractions over 12 consecutive days; three fractions of 1.5 Gy were employed each day with an interfraction interval of 6 hours. Of these 19 patients, 13 had local pelvic recurrence from rectal carcinoma, four had a primary rectal carcinoma (which was unsuitable for abdominoperineal resection because of patient frailty), and two had large, fixed, unresectable tumours and were given radiotherapy preoperatively to a lower dose of 42 Gy in 28 fractions over 10 days to facilitate surgery. However, none of the 19 patients subsequently underwent surgical resection. Treatment compliance with radiotherapy was 95%. Acute bowel toxicity was assessed by means of a daily bowel chart for 6 weeks and then at 8, 12 and 26 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy. Patients were subsequently scored using the World Health Organization (WHO) grading system. No toxic deaths were observed in this study. There were five grade 3 and one grade 4 toxicities (WHO scale) observed in six patients. There has been minimal acute bladder toxicity in two patients and skin reactions have been surprisingly minimal in all but three patients. Small bowel obstruction and late bowel damage, possibly attributable to radiotherapy, occurred in three patients. Complete pain relief was achieved in recurrent rectal cancer in 100% of patients, at a median of 15 days since commencing radiotherapy (range 7-63 days), and has been maintained for mean and median durations of 19 and 18 months respectively (range 1.5-45 months). Five patients have had a recurrence of pain at 3, 4, 8, 9 and 18 months respectively. All four patients with primary rectal adenocarcinoma achieved a complete response, which has been sustained for 4 months (until death), 54 and 57 months, although one patient relapsed locally at 8 months. In summary, CHART appears to be a feasible treatment for pelvic tumours with regard to toxicity. Patients with pain from a locoregional recurrence achieved rapid complete pain relief, which was sustained for many months.",Excluded,0.17268288

Aim/Introduction: To determine the value of systematically performing whole-body (head-to-toe) PET/CT images (WBPET) in the evaluation of patients with malignant melanoma and propose a criteria of when standard imaging can be performed. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective study of all WB-PET scans performed in patients with malignant melanoma in our hospital, either for staging, restaging, recurrence or post-treatment follow-up, between January 2011 and January 2020. We looked for any FDG avid foci in the lower extremities. The findings were considered as true positives if histopathological findings were confirmed, if the lesion was treated as melanoma because of other complementary findings (physical exploration, ultrasound, etc) or if during follow-up it was determined as malignant in nature. We also analyzed if the true positive findings had any change in patients management. Result(s): We analyzed 367 WB-PET studies belonging to 169 patients, 93 male (55%) and 76 female (45%), with a mean age of 56.4 years (range 19-90 years). Of the 367 studies performed 170 (46,3%) where for staging (all at least stage IIIB), and 197 (53,7%) for suspected recurrence or post treatment follow-up. From all the WB-PET scans we observed that 19 (5 %) had positive findings in the lower extremities, 11 (3%) of which were true-positive findings (all with histopathological confirmation), 8 (2%) scans were false positive (5 inflammatory foci demonstrated by clinical follow-up and 3 benign lesions (dermatophibroma, nevus and encondroma). From the 11 true-positive findings, 8 (2%) had the primary lesion in an infra-umbilical location; 1 (0.2%) was an extracutaneous melanoma (paranasal) but the finding could be included on a standard study, and the other 2(0,4%), had disseminated disease so the findings did not change clinical management. Also, none of these findings generated a change in management. Conclusion(s): In our cohort, we found that WB-PET in patients with melanoma had no additional value to standard (head-tomid-thigh) PET/CT images. We propose to perform WB-PET only in patients with the primary melanoma lesion located below the umbilical line. PET/CT acquisition of the lower extremities results in increased scan time and unnecessary radiation dose without generated therapeutic impact.",Excluded,0.17150551
1104,2342,"ARFI cut-off values and significance of standard deviation for liver fibrosis staging in patients with chronic liver disease Background. Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastometry quantifies hepatic stiffness, and thus degree of fibrosis, non-invasively. Our aim was to analyse the diagnostic accuracy of ARFI cut-off values, and the significance of a defined limit of standard deviation (SD) as a potential quality parameter for liver fibrosis staging in patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD). Material and methods. 153 patients with CLD (various aetiologies) undergoing liver biopsy, and an additional 25 patients with known liver cirrhosis, were investigated. ARFI measurements were performed in the right hepatic lobe, and correlated with the histopathological Ludwig fibrosis score (inclusion criteria: at least 6 portal tracts). The diagnostic accuracy of cut-off values was analysed with respect to an SD limit of 30% of the mean ARFI value. Results. The mean ARFI elastometry showed 1.95 +/- 0.87 m/s (range 0.79-4.40) in 178 patients (80 female, 98 male, mean age: 52 years). The cut-offs were 1.25 m/s for F >= 2, 1.72 m/s for F >= 3 and 1.75 m/s for F = 4, and the corresponding AUROC 80.7%, 86.2% and 88.7%, respectively. Exclusion of 31 patients (17.4%) with an SD higher than 30% of the mean ARFI improved the diagnostic accuracy: The AUROC for F >= 2, F >= 3 and F = 4 were 86.1%, 91.2% and 91.5%, respectively. Conclusion. The diagnostic accuracy of ARFI can be improved by applying a maximum SD of 30% of the mean ARFI as a quality parameter - which however leads to an exclusion of a relevant number of patients. ARFI results with a high SD should be interpreted with caution.",Excluded,0.17389005
1105,2343,"Effective time window in reducing pituitary adenoma size by gamma knife radiosurgery Objectives: Although the effectiveness of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in controlling the size of pituitary adenomas has been well demonstrated in many studies, the time period in which significant changes in tumor size occurs has been investigated in a limited fashion. It is important to determine the therapeutic window of GKRS in treating pituitary adenomas, i.e., the effective timeframe during which significant size reduction of these tumors occurs, so that alternative treatments such as further GKRS or microsurgery might be prescribed in a timely manner if clinically indicated. Method(s): This was a nested sample of an ongoing local cohort study on GKRS for pituitary adenomas at the University of Virginia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using dedicated sequences was employed. Only patients with a baseline MRI (TP0) and at least 1 follow-up study performed in the University Hospital after GKRS were included. The follow-up scans were performed at five time-points (TP1-TP5) which were 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months after GKRS. The dimensional indices of the tumors were measured in three orthogonal planes, i.e., transverse (TR), antero-posterior (AP) and cranio-caudal (CC). The volumes of the tumors were estimated by using the following formula: $${\text{V}} = \pi\,({\text{TR}} \times {\text{AP}} \times {\text{CC}})/6$$V=pi(TRxAPxCC)/6. Tumor volume decrease by more than 25 % from baseline was considered as 'shrinkage', <25 % tumor size increase or decrease was considered 'static', and more than 25 % increase as 'increment'. Our cohort consisted of 21 patients, with functioning adenomas in 13 subjects i.e. six adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-secreting and seven growth hormone (GH)-secreting, and non-functioning (NF) adenomas in eight subjects. Result(s): In 26 adenomas (8 ACTH, 9 GH and 9 NF), tumor control (tumor shrinkage or static) were achieved in 21 tumors (80.8 %); 89, 75, and 78 % for GH-secreting, ACTH-secreting and NF adenomas respectively, at the end of the 4-year follow-up period. Analysis of variance showed significant differences of GKRS margin dose among different types of tumors (p = 0.013), but not of baseline tumor volumes (p = 0.240). Logistic regression analysis showed no significant association of margin dose, baseline volume or tumor type with the tumor control outcome. Comparison of tumor change using dimensional indices relative to the base time point (TP0) showed that in the sample there was an average reduction of 1.290 mm at TP1 (6 months) with p values 0.155 (parametric t test) and 0.098 (non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-ranked test) respectively, showing a moderate reduction in tumor dimensional indices. The change in dimensional indices at later time points (TP2-TP5) showed an average reduction ranging from 1.930 to 2.471 mm. Significant reduction in the mean dimensional indices was firstly observed at TP2 (1 year) with p values 0.013 (t test) and 0.018 (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Such scale of reduction in the dimensional indices appeared to be maintained along the time axis (from TP2 to TP5). Conclusion(s): Significant decrease in tumor dimensional indices tended to occur at 1 year post-GKRS. Although to a lesser extent, such decrease in dimensional indices continued up to the end of our follow-up period.Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded,0.1749663
1106,2344,"High-pitch dual-source CT angiography of the thoracic and abdominal aorta: is simultaneous coronary artery assessment possible? OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the average heart rate and heart rate variability required for diagnostic imaging of the coronary arteries with high-pitch dual-source CT angiography of the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutively registered patients (82 men, 18 women; mean age, 68 +/- 13 years) underwent clinically indicated CT angiography of the thoracic (n = 33) and thoracoabdominal (n = 67) aorta with a dual-source 128-MDCT scanner in ECG-synchronized high-pitch (pitch, 3.2) data acquisition mode. No beta-blockers were administered. The image quality of the coronary arteries was graded on a 3-point scale by two independent blinded readers. The average heart rate and heart rate variability before data acquisition were noted. Effective radiation doses were calculated., RESULTS: Interobserver agreement on grade of image quality for the 1,414 coronary segments evaluated by both observers was good (kappa = 0.68). Diagnostic image quality was found for 1,375 of the 1,414 segments (97.2%) in 83 of 100 patients (83%). In 17% of the patients, image quality was nondiagnostic for at least one coronary artery segment. Average heart rate and heart rate variability (each p < 0.05) were significantly higher in patients with at least one nondiagnostic coronary segment compared with those without. All patients with an average heart rate less than 63 beats/min and heart rate variability less than 1.2 beats/min had diagnostic image quality in all coronary segments. Effective radiation doses were 2.3 +/- 0.3 mSv for thoracic and 4.4 +/- 0.5 mSv for thoracoabdominal CT angiography. The average scan times were 0.88 +/- 0.06 second for thoracic and 1.67 +/- 0.15 seconds for thoracoabdominal CT angiography., CONCLUSION: For patients with an average heart rate less than 63 beats/min and heart rate variability less than 1.2 beats/min, dual-source CT angiography of the thoracoabdominal aorta at a high pitch of 3.2 delivers diagnostic depiction of the coronary arteries at a low radiation dose.",Excluded,0.1716031

We aim to determine the ureteral length of the Malaysian population using CT measurement and to derive an ideal stent length guide based on body height. Materials and methods Phase-1 enrolled 118 patients. Bilateral ureteral lengths were measured by CT scan from the level of the renal vein to VUJ. They were grouped according to body height and median length for each were obtained. Phase-2 was a prospective randomisedtrial involving 60 patients undergoing ureteral stenting. 6F Double-J stents were used and choice of length in Group A was based on the devised guide; and using intraoperative ureteral length measurement with 5F catheter in Group B. Fluoroscopy time was recorded. Intravesical position of stent was determined by postoperative X-ray. USSQ score, were analysed two-weeks postoperatively. Results The median right and left ureteral length for male patients were 20.9 cm (18-27) and 21.3 cm (17-27); for female patients they were 20.7 cm (16-24) and 22.0 (17-25) respectively. Phase one concluded that double-J stents of 22 cm in length were suitable for all but men >=170 cm and women >=160 cm where a 24 cm stent is more appropriate. In Phase-2, median age was 49 (17-71) and median height of male and female patients were 165 cm (152-175) and 149 cm (140- 172) respectively. Fluoroscopy time is significantly shorter in Group A (3.03 vs 6.43 s, P = 0.001) and incidence of the distal loop crossing the midline was lower (0 vs 11, P < 0.001). Total USSQ score was better in Group A (60 vs 83, P = 0.001) particularly in urinary symptoms (P = 0.004) and pain (P < 0.001) subdomains. Stent migration was not encountered in both groups. Conclusion The devised ideal ureteral stent length guide for Malaysian adults is reliable, reduces procedural fluoroscopy time and curtails the incidence of post-procedural stent-related symptoms.",Excluded,0.17188124

Afterwards, SRP quadrants were randomly assigned for 10 sessions of LLLT., RESULTS: Results showed that when compared to sites treated with SRP alone, those treated with SRP+LLLT (10 sessions, 830 nm, 100 mW, 3 J per point, 3 J/cm(2)) exhibited greater reductions in PPD at 5 weeks and 3 months but not at 6 months. Further, SRP+LLLT-treated sites had a statistically significant increase in mean radiographic bone density when comparing 6- and 12-month data and overall from baseline to 12 months. There was a trend to reduce interleukin (IL)-1beta but the difference between control and laser sites was not statistically significant., CONCLUSIONS: SRP combined with LLLT improved radiographic bone density and short-term PPD reduction in patients with chronic periodontitis, but did not significantly affect either the gingival crevicular fluid of IL-1beta or the gingival or plaque index.",Excluded,0.18865432
1111,2349,"Development and evaluation of solid lipid nanoparticles of n-6-furfuryl adenine for prevention of photoaging N-6-furfuryl adenine (N6FA) also known as ""kinetin"" is a biologically active natural phytochemical. It belongs to the category of cytokinins, the natural plant growth hormones that promote cell division and play role in cell differentiation. Overall, N6FA aids in increasing the plant's life span. Human cells also contain small quantities of N6FA. Scientists are trying to understand its function in humans. N6FA is being investigated for its properties such as antiplatelet, antioxidant, antiproliferative and anti-aging effects on human cells. The aim of the present investigation was to prepare solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) based topical formulations of N6FA and to evaluate its efficacy against ultraviolet (UV) radiation induced skin photodamage. SLNs were prepared by hot microemulsion technique and optimized for the type and concentration of lipid and surfactant(s). The optimized SLN formulation was characterized in terms of particle size, drug entrapment efficiency, zeta potential and pH; evaluated for stability, spreadability, ex-vivo skin permeation and photoprotective effects against UV induced skin damage. The cumulative amount of drug permeated through mice skin using SLNs was 3 folds higher than from conventional cream base. The results of biochemical and histopathological investigations of skin treated with N6FA loaded SLNs clearly demonstrated the efficacy of optimized formulation in preventing photodamage (lesions, ulcers and changes in skin integrity) due to chronic UV exposure. The effects were comparable with widely used marketed formulation, Garnier wrinkle lift anti-aging cream. Results suggested that N6FA incorporated into SLNs may provide therapeutic as well as cosmeceutical benefits.Copyright © 2015 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.17924026

The purpose of this study was to assess the associations of biomechanical properties of the cornea with metabolic and environmental factors in an elderly population. METHODS. The ALIENOR (Antioxydants, Lipides Essentiels, Nutrition, and Maladies OculaiRes) study is a population-based study. In 2009-2010, 624 subjects, aged 74 years or more, underwent an eye examination, including intraocular pressure (IOP), central corneal thickness (CCT), and biomechanical properties of the cornea measurements using the Ocular Response Analyzer. Socio-demographic, lifestyle, and medical history data were collected using standardized questionnaires. Mean lifetime ambient ultraviolet (UV) exposure was estimated using residential history and statistics of UV radiation at each location using the Eurosun UV database. RESULTS. Mean age was 82.2 +/- 4.3 years. Mean corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal resistance factor (CRF), and CCT were 9.4 +/- 1.9, 9.8 +/- 1.9 mm Hg, and 551.6 +/- 36.8 mum, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, CH and CRF values were significantly lower in subjects older than 80 years (-0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.89;-0.24); P < 0.001 and -0.48; 95% CI: -0.75;-0.20; P < 0.001, respectively), in subjects having higher ambient UV exposure (-0.50; 95% CI: -0.88;-0.12; P < 0.01; and -0.46; 95% CI: -0.78;-0.13); P < 0.05, respectively), and in subjects with high plasma LDL cholesterol (CH: -0.46; 95% CI: -0.86;-0.03; P < 0.05; and CRF: -0.37; 95% CI: -0.72;-0.008; P < 0.05). Central corneal thickness was significantly higher in former smokers than in never smokers (+11.01; 95% CI: 0.48;21.55; P < 0.05) and was not significantly associated with age, ambient UV exposure, diabetes, or LDL cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS. Biomechanical properties of the cornea are modified by metabolic and lifetime environmental factors, especially UV exposure. The manner these factors may influence onset and progression of ocular diseases or IOP measurements need further investigation.Copyright © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

The aim of the study is to assess recently released web based software, ""Click2correct"" during preoperative planning of patients with lower extremity trauma. The angular deformity and length measurements of fractured bones is highly dependent to taken reference points. The new proposed system offer easy tools for standardization in determination of reference points, which were aimed to tested in the present study. Material(s) and Method(s): Twentyfour patients (eight females and sixteen males) with lower extremity fracture were admitted sequentially to orthopaedics and traumatology department of the same university. All patients were examined with direct x rays. The from fracture distorted and deformed bones were assessed with measurement tools of the PACS system of the Hospital. The radiographs were also uploaded to the click2correct web site. The angular deormity and leg length changes were also assessed by two researchers. The accuracy, and reliability were tested statistically between researchers and their measurements. Result(s): There were found positive correlations interobservers and intraoberver measurements in terms of assesment of angular deformity and shortening of fractured bones. Before decision of treatment modality the positional analysis of fractured bone parts of tibia and femurs has to be evaluated. The preoperative planning softwares aims to ease these procedure. The recently released software announced web based working solution as an advantage. Also new tools were offered during determination of reference points during measurement for standardization. The present study has found consistency between measurements. Furthermore virtual fracture reduction facility, which also guides in proper implant selection and placement was found useful.

1119,2357,"Esthesioneuroblastoma - Clinical experience from a regional cancer centre in North India Background: This study is aimed to assess the clinical management and outcome in patients of esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB). Methods and Materials: A retrospective review of medical records of patients of ENB (2009-10) was conducted. Primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method (SPSS version 17). Result(s): We identified 22 patients of ENB diagnosed at our centre from 2009-10. Altogether 4 patients were excluded due to attrition & 18 patients were evaluable. Median age at diagnosis was 29 years (Range 3-67 years). A male preponderance was noted (male:female = 2:1). Tumour stage was Kadish B in 7 & Kadish C in 11 patients. Cervical lymphadenopathy was noted in 4 patients at presentation. Common symptoms included epistaxis in 50%; nasal obstruction, proptosis & visual dimness in 27.77% each & nasal mass in 16.66% patients. 11/18 patients underwent surgery. Radiotherapy was used in all patients-16 with radical intent (median dose 60 Gy; range45-70 Gy) & 2 with palliative intent (range 8-30 Gy/1-10fractions). Radiation plan was 2 dimensional using telecobalt in 2 patients & 3 dimensional using megavoltage X-rays in 16 patients. Treatment volume encompassed the gross tumour with a safety margin of 1-2 cm. Neck was addressed in patients with involved nodes. Common field arrangement included 2 anterior oblique or anterolateral or superior & inferior vetex beams. Chemotherapy was used in the following setting: neoadjuvant in 10 patients (common regimens CAPcyclophosphamide, adriamycin & cisplatin; EP-etoposide & cisplatin; VACvincristine, actinomycinD, cyclophosphamide), concurrent in 3 patients with weekly cisplatin & adjuvant in 5 patients with EP regimen. 7 patients had died at last follow-up with causes being local recurrence in 2, nodal recurrence in 2, distant dissemination in 3 (metastases in bone, brain & chest wall respectively), disease persistence in1 & unknown in 1. After a median follow-up of 14.43 months, 2 year overall survival & progressionfree survival were respectively 62%+/-13% & 49.7+/-14%. Conclusion(s): Management of esthesioneuroblastoma poses clinical challenge due to rarity, complex topography of disease, morbidity of extensive surgery and absence of well defined treatment protocols.

1120,2358,"Creating percutaneous radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas at the wrist Background: The first arteriovenous fistulas were created at the wrist more than 60 years ago. Basic surgical construction techniques remain unchanged with mobilization and repositioning of the vessels followed by a sutured anastomosis. We used the Ellipsys device to construct percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas at the wrist and report the results. Method(s): Data were reviewed retrospectively for all patients who had a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula created during a 6-month period. Each individual underwent ultrasound vessel mapping in addition to physical examination. When a radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula was feasible and a communicating vein 2 mm in diameter was noted in the distal forearm along with a radial artery 2 mm, a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula was considered and reviewed with the patient. Result(s): Four individuals met the criteria to consider a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula and all elected to have the procedure performed. Ages were 54-85 years. Three were diabetic and one was female. All percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas were technically successful. Two individuals had not yet started dialysis therapy. Successful and repetitive cannulation for the two individuals with catheters was initiated at 4 and 8 weeks post procedure. The two pre-dialysis patients had physiologic arteriovenous fistula maturation (6 mm vein diameter and >500 mL/min flow) at 4 and 12 weeks. There were no procedural or late complications and none required intervention. Follow-up was 8-23 months (mean 16 months). Conclusion(s): The success of these percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas suggests that use of the Ellipsys device will be applicable at the wrist in selected patients where appropriate vessel sizes and configurations are found.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded,0.17098264
1122,2360,"Cohort profile: four early uranium processing facilities in the US and Canada PURPOSE: Pooling of individual-level data for workers involved in uranium refining and processing (excluding enrichment) may provide valuable insights into risks from occupational uranium and external ionizing radiation exposures., METHODS: Data were pooled for workers from four uranium processing facilities (Fernald, Mallinckrodt and Middlesex from the U.S.; and Port Hope, Canada). Employment began as early as the 1930s and follow-up was as late as 2017. Workers were exposed to high concentrations of uranium, radium, and their decay products, as well as gamma radiation and ambient radon decay products. Exposure and outcome data were harmonized using similar definitions and dose reconstruction methods. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were estimated., RESULTS: In total, 560 deaths from lung cancer, 503 non-malignant respiratory diseases, 67 renal diseases, 1,596 ischemic heart diseases, and 101 dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) were detected in the pooled cohort of over 12,400 workers (~1,300 females). Mean cumulative doses were 45 millisievert for whole-body external ionizing radiation exposure and 172 milligray for lung dose from radon decay products. Only SMR for dementia and AD among males was statistically significant (SMR=1.29; 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.54)., CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study to date to examine long-term health risks of uranium processing workers.",Included,0.9577001

Patients received either cream 1 (the natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin) or cream 2 (aqueous cream). Skin toxicity, pain, itching, and skin-related quality of life scores were collected for up to 4 weeks after radiation treatment., Results: Patients who received cream 1 had a significantly lower average level of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events at week 3 (P<.05) but had statistically higher average levels of skin toxicity at weeks 7, 8, and 9 (all P<.001). Similar results were observed when skin toxicity was analyzed by grades. With regards to pain, patients in the cream 2 group had a significantly higher average level of worst pain (P<.05) and itching (P=.046) compared with the cream 1 group at week 3; however, these differences were not observed at other weeks. In addition, there was a strong trend for cream 2 to reduce the incidence of grade 2 or more skin toxicity in comparison with cream 1 (P=.056). Overall, more participants in the cream 1 group were required to use another topical treatment at weeks 8 (P=.049) and 9 (P=.01)., Conclusion: The natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin seems to have similar effects for managing skin toxicity compared with aqueous cream up to week 5; however, it becomes significantly less effective at later weeks into the radiation treatment and beyond treatment completion (week 6 and beyond). There were no major differences in pain, itching, and skin-related quality of life. In light of these results, clinicians and patients can base their decision on costs and preferences. Overall, aqueous cream seems to be a more preferred option.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.17940457
1133,2371,"Patient Knowledge Regarding Radiation Exposure From Foot and Ankle Imaging Foot and ankle surgeons routinely prescribe diagnostic imaging that exposes patients to potentially harmful ionizing radiation. It is unclear how well patients understand the radiation to which they are exposed. In this study, 946 consecutive new patients were surveyed regarding medical imaging and radiation exposure prior to their first appointment. Respondents compared the amount of radiation associated with chest X-rays (CXRs) with various types of foot and ankle imaging. Results were compared with actual values of radiation exposure from the published literature. Of 946 patients surveyed, 841 (88.9%) participated. Most had private insurance (82.8%) and a bachelor's degree or higher (60.6%). Most believed that foot X-ray, ankle X-ray, ""low dose"" foot and ankle computed tomography (CT) scan (alluding to cone-beam CT), and traditional foot and ankle CT scan contain similar amounts of ionizing radiation to CXR. This contradicts the published literature that suggests that the actual exposure to patients is 0.006, 0.006, 0.127, and 0.833 CXR equivalents of radiation, respectively. Of patients who had undergone an X-ray, 55.9% thought about the issue of radiation prior to the study, whereas 46.1% of those undergoing a CT scan considered radiation prior to the exam. Similarly, 35.2% and 27.6% reported their doctor having discussed radiation with them prior to obtaining an X-ray and CT scan, respectively. Patients greatly overestimate the radiation exposure associated with plain film X-rays and cone-beam CT scans of the foot and ankle, and may benefit from increased counseling regarding the relatively low radiation exposure associated with these imaging modalities.

1134,2372,"Long-term survival and symptom palliation in small primary bronchial carcinomas following treatment with intraluminal radiotherapy alone Between April 1988 and December 1992, 37 patients with small, previously unirradiated, primary non-small cell carcinomas of the bronchus causing symptoms due to endobronchial disease were treated at the Christie Hospital, Manchester, with a single fraction of high dose rate intraluminal radiotherapy (ILT) using the microSelectron-HDR machine. Small primary (SP) lesions were defined as being less than 2 cm in diameter in a direction perpendicular to the central axis of the iridium-192 treatment source. Fifteen patients (41%) were treated to a dose of 15 Gy and 22 patients (59%) to 20 Gy at a distance of 1 cm from the central axis of the source. At 6 weeks following ILT, improvement in symptoms was seen in the following percentages of patients: haemoptysis 96%, pulmonary collapse 69%, cough 55% and dyspnoea 52%. The magnitude of improvement in these symptoms was largely maintained in patients surviving to 4 months and then 12 months post-ILT. Median actuarial survival was 709 days, 2-year survival 49.4% and 5-year survival 14.1%. Overall, there was no significant difference in survival after treatment with 20 Gy compared with 15 Gy at 1 cm. At the close of study, there were four patients still alive without disease recurrence with survivals of 38, 48, 49 and 63 months. All had had biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinomas and all had been treated with 20 Gy at 1 cm. Five patients died from massive haemoptysis as a terminal event at 4, 9, 9, 10 and 11 months post-ILT, well below the median survival for this group of patients. Again, all had been treated with 20 Gy as opposed to 15 Gy at 1 cm. Over the same time period, 287 patients with non-small cell carcinomas of more than 2 cm in diameter (large primary lesions, LP), were treated with a single fraction of ILT only, as their initial treatment. A consistently greater percentage of patients with SP lesions showed an improvement in the symptoms of haemoptysis and pulmonary collapse when compared with patients with LP lesions. Patients with LP lesions demonstrated a decreased actuarial survival when compared with SP lesions, with median survival being 156 days, 2-year survival 3.1% and no survivors beyond 39 months. This study demonstrates that, in patients with small endobronchial carcinomas a single fraction of ILT can give efficient palliation of symptoms and lead to long term disease-free survival, but that a dose of 20 Gy may be at the limit of bronchial radiation tolerance for a single dose technique employing a high dose rate source.",Excluded,0.18446262
1135,2373,"Normalized Dual-Energy Iodine Ratio Best Differentiates Renal Cell Carcinoma Subtypes among Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers from Perfusion CT and Dual-Energy CT OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to assess and compare the diagnostic accuracy of perfusion CT (PCT) and dual-energy CT (DECT) in differentiating clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) from non-ccRCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included 51 patients with 52 renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) (36 ccRCCs and 16 non-ccRCCs) who underwent both PCT and DECT before surgery or biopsy between January 2014 and December 2018. Three independent readers measured blood flow, blood volume (BV), and permeability using PCT and iodine concentration (IC) and iodine ratio using DECT. Interreader agreement was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess PCT and DECT models. Size-specific dose estimates of the two methods were compared. RESULTS. BV (ICC, 0.93) and iodine ratio (ICC, 0.85) were the most reproducible parameters. Both PCT and DECT were significant models (p < 0.05, all readers) for differentiating ccRCC from non-ccRCC. There was no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between PCT and DECT (p > 0.05). BV and iodine ratio were independent predictors of non-ccRCC (p < 0.05). However, the mean size-specific dose estimate was 16 times lower with DECT than with PCT (p < 0.001). The AUC of iodine ratio was 0.95, and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy with an iodine ratio cutoff of 63.72% was 0.90, 0.86, and 0.87, respectively. CONCLUSION. PCT and DECT had comparable and high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating RCC subtypes; however, because of the significantly lower radiation dose of DECT, iodine ratio may be used as the best independent predictor.Copyright © American Roentgen Ray Society",Excluded,0.17192148
1137,2375,"Effects of Probiotics with or without Honey on Radiation-induced Diarrhea Background: Diarrhea is a well-recognized side effect associated with pelvic radiation; however, there is not any effective common treatment for radiation-induced diarrhea. A popular alternative is probiotics, which have been used in several gastrointestinal disorders. Probiotics are live microbial food supplements. Furthermore, honey is a putative nutritional with a variety of health effects, including antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and prebiotic. The present study evaluated the effects of probiotic with or without honey on radiation-induced diarrhea. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty-seven adult patients with pelvic cancer underwent radiotherapy for four weeks. They randomized to receive probiotic (n = 22), probiotic plus honey (n = 21) or placebo (n = 24) from one week before radiotherapy for five weeks. Diarrhea grade and stool consistency score were recorded weekly according to the Common Toxicity Criteria system and the Bristol scales, respectively. Result(s): The results showed a decrease in the daily number of bowel movements (p = 0.003 and 0.006), diarrhea grade (p = 0.001 and 0.001) and the need for antidiarrheal medication (p = 0.021 and 0.041) also an increase in the stool consistency (p = 0.004 and 0.005) in patients who either used probiotic or probiotic plus honey (respectively), these were significant in weeks 4 and 5 of treatment.

Frequently, patients with osteoarthritis (OA) are misdiagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in primary care centers, leading to wrong treatment and consequent clinical and pharmacoeconomic impact Objectives The objective of this study was to describe demographic and clinical characteristics of a cohort of patients derived to a specialized RA center with presumptive RA diagnosis and finally diagnosed as osteoarthritis Methods A descriptive, cross sectional study. Patients were referred and assisted to a specialized RA center in a 24 month period with presumptive diagnosis of this disease. A complete medical record was fulfilled by a rheumatologist; it was measured rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated antibodies, and other laboratories depending on each case. Also were made x-rays of hands, and in some cases of persistent doubt about the diagnosis was requested comparative MRI of hands. Frequencies and Percentages were calculated for the demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort of patients Results From a total of 3665 Patients derived to specialized in RA center with presumptive RA diagnosis, after medical and laboratory evaluation 1451 (39.6%) had a wrong RA diagnosis; of them 1116 patients (76.9%) had finally osteoarthritis diagnosis. Of these patients 790 (70.7%) were women and 326 (29.2%) men, with an average age of 59.7 (+/-12 years).

However, the prognostic value of PET/CT metrics in LS-SCLC is not clear. Method(s): Subjects in this retrospective study were 50 patients with LS-SCLC who had had PET/CT before definitive chemoradiation therapy in January 2003 to August 2009; 15 (29%) had also had induction chemotherapy. Median radiation dose was 45 Gy (range, 40.5 to 61.8 Gy). All scans were read and scored by 1 radiologist. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival outcomes, and Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the prognostic value of pretreatment standardized uptake values (SUVs) with regard to locoregional control (LRC) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): At a median follow-up time of 18.2 months (range, 2.1 to 78 mo), LRC rates were 64% at 2 and 3 years; OS rates were 81% at 2 years and 61% at 3 years. None of the metrics assessed (receipt of induction chemotherapy, pretreatment SUV primary, SUVnodal, meanSUVmax) was associated with LRC or OS, but patients with residual SUV<=5.5 after treatment had a 3-year OS rate of 69% versus 34% for those with SUV>5.5. Conclusion(s): Pretreatment PET/CT metrics had no prognostic significance for patients with LS-SCLC, perhaps because of the rapid proliferation of SCLC or other confounding factors affecting survival.

1144,2382,"Incidence of pain flare following palliative radiation therapy for symptomatic bone metastases: Multicenter prospective observational study Purpose/Objective(s): Palliative radiation therapy (RT) is a wellestablished treatment option for symptomatic bone metastases, with few treatment-related side effects. However, pain flare, a temporary worsening of bone pain in the irradiated metastatic site, has been recognized following RT. The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of pain flare following RT for painful bone metastases. Materials/Methods: Patients with bone metastases treated with RT were eligible. Worst pain scores and analgesic consumption were collected before, daily during, and for 10 days after treatment. Pain flare was defined as a 2-point increase in the worst pain score (0-10) compared to baseline with no decrease in analgesic intake, or a 25% increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in worst pain score. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was administered to measure the ""sensory"" dimension of pain (intensity, or severity) and its ""reactive"" dimension (interference with daily function) before the RT treatment and at the 4-weeks follow-up evaluation. Descriptive statistics were reported. Response rate and 95% confidence intervals were calculated at 4 weeks after RT. A comparison of patients with pain flare vs those without was performed. The relationships between the occurrence of pain flare and collected demographic variables were investigated. Result(s): From June 2010 to December 2013, 160 patients were enrolled in this study. From this cohort, 94 patients with complete data were evaluable for pain flare. There were 61 (65%) men and 33 (35%) women. Median age was 66 years. The majority of patients had primary breast (12%), lung (31%), or prostate (22%) carcinoma and were treated with 8 Gy in a single fraction (28%) or 20 Gy in five fractions (65%). The overall pain flare incidence across all centers was 42/94 (44.7%). The majority of pain flares occurred on Days 1-5 (88%) as opposed to Days 6-10 (12%). The median duration of the pain flare was 2 days. There was no significant difference between patients who experienced a pain flare vs those who did not in terms of sex, age, primary cancer site, radiation dose, previous systemic therapy, location or area of RT, or on any of the BPI items (p > 0.05). BPI scores showed a significant improvement at 4 weeks on all functional interference items (p < 0.05). The main differences were seen in the ""worst pain"" and ""sleep"" domains, both decreased from 7/10 at baseline to 4/10 at the 4-week follow-up. Conclusion(s): Pain flare is a common event, occurring in nearly half of the patients that receive palliative RT for symptomatic bone metastases. Furthermore, RT for symptomatic bone metastases is a very effective palliative treatment, in terms of both pain control and functional interference.",Excluded,0.17539392
1146,2384,"Nail dystrophy and periungual discoloration in sarcoidosis Background : Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that can affect all organs of the body. The disease course can vary from a self-limiting illness to a chronic disease with flares and relapses. Nail changes are rare in sarcoidosis, but can include clubbing, discolouration, dystrophy, subungual hyperkeratosis, splinter haemorrhages and longitudinal ridges. Such changes are frequently an indication of systemic disease, We report a rare case of systemic sarcoidosis presenting as nail dystrophy with painful phalanges and underlying bony cysts. Observation: A 57 year old moroccan woman, with a 2-year history of periungual redpurplish discoloration associated with nail dystrophy of 4 of his toes, presented to the dermatology department. Examination of his toes showed evidence of red to purple discoloration in the nail folds with associated nail dystrophy and subungual hyperkeratosis. Examination of his entire skin showed a symetric ulcerated dactilitis of 2 fingers. Nail clippings were obtained for mycological examination, with negative results. A Hand and toes X-ray demonstrated bony cysts, trabecular pattern and osteolysis in distal phalanx. CT showed multiples lymphadenopaty above and under diaphragmatic. A punch biopsy taken from the nail bed, the lymphadenopathy and salivary gland showed sarcoid granulomas in the dermis and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate. With all this finding, the diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis was making, and the patient receive a systemic treatment with corticosteroid: 0.5 mg/kg/day. After 1 week of treatment, the patient had a good response. Key message: Although nail changes are rare in sarcoidosis, they are often associated with systemic involvement (commonly pulmonary involvement, dactylitis and lymphadenopathy) and underlying bony changes. Thus, in patients presenting with nail involvement, a search for possible systemic involvement should take place, and this should include radiological imaging of hands and feet alongside chest imaging.",Excluded,0.17287223

Materials and methods Data from 37 patients with cervical lymph node involvement were used. All patients originally received chemotherapy followed by 3DCRT-INRT (30.6 Gy). A VMAT-INRT, PT-INRT (both 30.6 Gy), and a MF plan (36 Gy) were simulated. Doses to head and neck OARs were compared with cumulative DVHs and repeated measures ANOVA. Results The estimated median mean doses were 15.3, 19.3, 15.4, and 37.3 Gy (thyroid), 10.9, 12.0, 7.9, and 34.5 Gy (neck muscles), 2.3, 11.1, 1.8, and 37.1 Gy (larynx), 1.7, 5.1, 1.3, and 23.8 Gy (pharynx), 0.5, 0.8, 0.01, and 32.3 Gy (ipsilateral parotid), and 2.4, 3.8, 0.7, and 34.7 Gy (ipsilateral submandibular) with 3DCRT, VMAT, PT, and MF (all p < 0.0001), respectively. Conclusion The use of INRT significantly lowered the estimated radiation dose to the head and neck OARs.

This phase III trial was planned to determine whether in the same category of patients 8 Gy single-dose is as effective as 8 Gy x 2. Material(s) and Method(s): Three hundred and twenty-seven patients with MSCC and short life expectancy were randomly assigned to a short-course of 8 Gy x 2 or to 8 Gy single-dose RT.

1153,2391,"Innate immune responses of Drosophila melanogaster are altered by spaceflight Alterations and impairment of immune responses in humans present a health risk for space exploration missions. The molecular mechanisms underpinning innate immune defense can be confounded by the complexity of the acquired immune system of humans. Drosophila (fruit fly) innate immunity is simpler, and shares many similarities with human innate immunity at the level of molecular and genetic pathways. The goals of this study were to elucidate fundamental immune processes in Drosophila affected by spaceflight and to measure host-pathogen responses post-flight. Five containers, each containing ten female and five male fruit flies, were housed and bred on the space shuttle (average orbit altitude of 330.35 km) for 12 days and 18.5 hours. A new generation of flies was reared in microgravity. In larvae, the immune system was examined by analyzing plasmatocyte number and activity in culture. In adults, the induced immune responses were analyzed by bacterial clearance and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of selected genes following infection with E. coli. The RNA levels of relevant immune pathway genes were determined in both larvae and adults by microarray analysis. The ability of larval plasmatocytes to phagocytose E. coli in culture was attenuated following spaceflight, and in parallel, the expression of genes involved in cell maturation was downregulated. In addition, the level of constitutive expression of pattern recognition receptors and opsonins that specifically recognize bacteria, and of lysozymes, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) pathway and immune stress genes, hallmarks of humoral immunity, were also reduced in larvae. In adults, the efficiency of bacterial clearance measured in vivo following a systemic infection with E. coli post-flight, remained robust. We show that spaceflight altered both cellular and humoral immune responses in Drosophila and that the disruption occurs at multiple interacting pathways.",Excluded,0.20848045
1155,2393,"Is it possible to avoid hypopituitarism after the irradiation of pituitary adenomas by the Leksell gamma-knife? Radiation therapy is used in the treatment of pituitary adenomas, especially in failures of neurosurgery and pharmacotherapy to reduce the size of adenomas and normalize their hypersecretion. Conventional fractionated radiotherapy has achieved good results, but only after a long latency, with considerable postradiation morbidity and with very frequent appearance of hypopituitarism. The focal stereotactic targeting allowed by Leksell gamma-knife (LGK) was supposed to decrease the incidence of hypopituitarism, however our first patients treated by LGK developed hypopituitarism in 38.2%. Consequently, we have analyzed factors leading to this unfavorable outcome and suggested that the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary tissue is the most important cause of hypopituitarism. Result(s): Seventy-five patients (47 women and 28 men) with pituitary adenomas (39 with acromegaly, 17 prolactinomas, 8 with Cushing's disease, 1 with Nelson's syndrome and 9 functionless adenomas), where the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary tissue was measured, were followed 60-180 (mean 91.1) months. In 41 patients, the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary was more than 15 Gy. The hypopituitarism at least in one axis developed in 29 (70.7%) patients during 10-126 months after the irradiation. In 34 patients, the mean dose on pituitary was less than 15 Gy. Only one patient (1.2%) developed hypopituitarism 12 months after the irradiation. This patient had undergone two previous pituitary surgeries and had already central hypothyreosis when irradiated. Conclusion(s): To avoid hypopituitarism the radiation dose of 15 Gy is the maximum safe limit of the mean dose of radiation to the pituitary tissue surrounding the adenoma. This cut off should become a rule when irradiating pituitary adenomas - just like the dose rules of 7 Gy on the optical tract or 14 Gy on the brainstem.",Excluded,0.20812681

The effect of radiotherapy (RT) on the expression of these proteins in patients is unknown. We assessed the influence of RT on the expression of p53 and p21(waf1) in normal mucosa and rectal carcinomas in vivo., METHODS: Tumor and normal tissue samples were derived from rectal cancer patients randomized in a clinical trial in which the value of preoperative RT was evaluated. p53 and p21(waf1) expression was determined in 51 irradiated and 52 nonirradiated patients using immunohistochemistry., RESULTS: In normal mucosa, both p53 and p21(waf1) were strongly upregulated after RT compared with the expression in unirradiated normal tissue (p <0.001). In tumor cells, no significant difference in the expression of p53 or p21(waf1) was found in the irradiated vs. nonirradiated group. In the few rectal tumors with wild-type p53, induction of p53 after RT did not necessarily lead to upregulation of p21(waf1)., CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that in normal mucosa, a functional p53-p21(waf1) pathway is present, whereas in tumor cells it is defective in almost all cases because of either p53 mutation or down- or upstream disruption in tumors with wild-type p53. Therefore, we believe that the role of p53 expression as a single prognostic marker in rectal cancer needs reconsideration.",Included,0.9558381

1164,2402,"Age effects in identifying and localising dichotic stimuli: a corpus callosum deficit? In the present study, dichotic listening performance of 31 older adults was compared with performance of 25 younger adults under free and focused attention conditions. In addition to an age-related general decrease in performance, we observed in the focused attention condition increased asymmetry in the elderly group: the decrease of recall performance was stronger for the left ear (LE) then for the right ear (RE), while the increase of localisation errors were greater for the RE than for LE. Identifying and localising digits appear to be different process mediated predominantly by the left and right hemisphere, respectively. Since age-related reduced performance is strongest for the ear ipsilateral to the hemisphere dominant to that particular function, these finding may be ascribed to decline of corpus callosum functioning resulting in decrease interhemispheric interaction rather than to a selective decline of right hemisphere functions.",Excluded,0.19821778
1167,2405,"Acute Erythemal Ultraviolet Radiation Causes Systemic Immunosuppression in the Absence of Increased 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 Levels in Male Mice Vitamin D is synthesised by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of skin and is hypothesized to be a direct mediator of the immunosuppression that occurs following UV radiation (UVR) exposure. Both UVR and vitamin D drive immune responses towards tolerance by ultimately increasing the suppressive activities of regulatory T cells. To examine a role for UVR-induced vitamin D, vitamin D3-deficient mice were established by dietary vitamin D3 restriction. In comparison to vitamin D3-replete mice, vitamin D3-deficient mice had significantly reduced serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3, <20 nmol.L-1) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3, <20 pmol.L-1). Following either acute erythemal UVR, or chronic sub-erythemal UVR (8 exposures over 4 weeks) treatment, serum 25(OH)D3 levels significantly increased in vitamin D3-deficient female but not male mice. To determine if UVR-induced vitamin D was a mediator of UVR-induced systemic immunosuppression, responses were measured in mice that were able (female) or unable (male) to increase systemic levels of 25(OH)D3 after UVR. Erythemal UVR (>=4 kJ/m2) suppressed contact hypersensitivity responses (T helper type-1 or -17), aspects of allergic airway disease (T helper type-2) and also the in vivo priming capacity of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells to a similar degree in female and male vitamin D3-deficient mice. Thus, in male mice, UVR-induced 25(OH)D3 is not essential for mediating the immunosuppressive effects of erythemal UVR. © 2012 Gorman et al.",Excluded,0.1939989

1171,2409,"Lower body negative pressure: Physiological effects, applications, and implementation This review presents lower body negative pressure (LBNP) as a unique tool to investigate the physiology of integrated systemic compensatory responses to altered hemodynamic patterns during conditions of central hypovolemia in humans. An early review published in Physiological Reviews over 40 yr ago (Wolthuis et al. Physiol Rev 54: 566-595, 1974) focused on the use of LBNP as a tool to study effects of central hypovolemia, while more than a decade ago a review appeared that focused on LBNP as a model of hemorrhagic shock (Cooke et al. J Appl Physiol (1985) 96: 1249-1261, 2004). Since then there has been a great deal of new research that has applied LBNP to investigate complex physiological responses to a variety of challenges including orthostasis, hemorrhage, and other important stressors seen in humans such as microgravity encountered during spaceflight. The LBNP stimulus has provided novel insights into the physiology underlying areas such as intolerance to reduced central blood volume, sex differences concerning blood pressure regulation, autonomic dysfunctions, adaptations to exercise training, and effects of space flight. Furthermore, approaching cardiovascular assessment using prediction models for orthostatic capacity in healthy populations, derived from LBNP tolerance protocols, has provided important insights into the mechanisms of orthostatic hypotension and central hypovolemia, especially in some patient populations as well as in healthy subjects. This review also presents a concise discussion of mathematical modeling regarding compensatory responses induced by LBNP. Given the diverse applications of LBNP, it is to be expected that new and innovative applications of LBNP will be developed to explore the complex physiological mechanisms that underline health and disease.Copyright © 2019 the American Physiological Society.",Excluded,0.17794637

Patients and methods. - A retrospective study of 68 patients (30 in stage T1 and 38 in stage T2). Results. - The median treatment duration was 6 weeks. Three months after the end of TSEB, a complete clinical response occurred in 66 patients (97%). The most marked effects of acute toxicity included localized ulcerations in 13 patients (13.2%) not requiring hospitalization. Mean follow-up was 6.5 years (1.6 to 28.7). The overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 86% and 71%, respectively. Thirty-nine patients (57.4%) experienced relapse with a mean diseasefree interval of 1.8 years. The disease-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 41% and 31%, respectively. This rate was higher when TSEB was performed early (p = 0.031). Twenty-one years after TSEB, only one case of cutaneous malignancy (basal cell carcinoma) was noted. Discussion. - Because of its high response rates and rapidity of action, TSEB should be considered as first-line therapy in the management of early-stage mycosis fungoides. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We standardized clinical investigation to test its added value to MRI response evaluation and investigated the benefit of FDG-PET/CT. Materials and methods Radiological response evaluation using Ojiri-score was done for 234 patients with OPC, using MRI 12 weeks after (chemo) radiotherapy between 2010 and 2014. The presence of mucosal lesions and/or major complaints (still completely tube feeding-dependent and/or opiate-dependent because of swallowing problems) was scored as clinical suspicion (CS). Retrospectively, the performance of Ojiri to predict RD was compared to CS and both combined using Pearson Chi-squared. Of the whole group, FDG-PET/CT metabolic response (MR) was available in 50 patients. Results Twelve out of 234 patients (5.1%) had RD. Ojiri and CS had excellent negative predictive value (NPV) (98% and 100% respectively). The combination of CS and Ojiri reduced false positives by 32% (38-26 patients) without lowering NPV (98%). No patients with complete MR (n = 39) at the FDG-PET/CT had RD compared to 5 (45%) with partial MR. Conclusion For response evaluation in OPC, the combination of CS and Ojiri-score improved the predictive accuracy by reducing false positives compared to them individually. FDG-PET/CT is promising to further reduce false positives.Copyright © 2017 The Authors",Excluded,0.17167805
1179,2417,"Five-year outcome of stand-alone fusion using carbon cages in cervical disc arthrosis From January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2003, in the Neurosurgery Department of Rome University o ""Sapienza,"" 167 patients underwent anterior surgery for cervical spondylodiscoarthrosis. The levels treated by the anterior stand-alone technique were: C3-C4 (11%), C4-C5 (19%), C5-C6 (40%), and C6-C7 (30%). All patients underwent left anterior presternocleidomastoid-precarotid approach, microdiscectomy, and interbody fusion using a carbon fiber cage filled with hydroxyapatite. All patients were discharged within 48 h after surgery with cervical orthosis. In one case, a hematoma of the surgical site occurred within 12 h of surgery; for this reason the patient underwent surgical revision and was discharged 4 days later. All patients have worn cervical orthosis for a mean period of 7 weeks and underwent radiological follow-up with cervical RX at 1 and 3 months after surgery. All patients underwent follow-up from 54 to 90 months after surgery, and all of them underwent cervical RX, cervical CT scans for the estimate of fusion, and evaluation of neurological status using VAS and NDI. Of 167 patients, 132 were cooperative for this study, 18 were non-cooperative, and 17 died. The estimation of fusion made by cervical CT scans with sagittal reconstruction showed complete osteointegration of the cage in 115 patients (87.1%), while it showed pseudoarthrosis in 17 patients (12.9%). In 24 patients, we observed adjacent segment degeneration, and 13 of these underwent new surgical procedures in this institute or in another hospital. Clinical evaluation with VAS and NDI showed a good outcome, with poorest benefit in patients over 60 years. The clinical analysis showed a good fusion rate in according with literature, 13% of non-fusion rate without clinical evidence and 20% of ASDegeneration but only 10% had required new surgery. We also observed that patients over 60 years of age had less satisfactory outcome, probably related with the evolution of pathophysiological degeneration of the cervical spine. In the opinion, pseudoarthrosis is caused by malpositioning of the carbon fiber cage. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded,0.17178622
1180,2418,"Cardiac computed tomography previous to atrial fibrillation ablation - effects of technological improvements and protocol optimization BACKGROUND: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) can provide a precise tridimentional anatomic map and exclude intra-cardiac thrombus. We aimed to access the impact of CT protocol optimization and technological evolution on the contrast and radiation dose as well as on image quality previous to atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation., METHODS: From a prospective registry of consecutive patients who underwent cardiac CT in a single center, we selected 270 patients in whom the CT was done for evaluation prior to AF ablation and they were distributed in 3 groups: Group1: the first 150 patients included; Group2: the last 60 patients performed with the same CT scanner; Group3: the first 60 exams performed with the new CT scanner. Quality of the protocol was access based on radiation dose, contrast volume used, the use of a second (delayed) acquisition, and on quantitative image quality analisis (signal to noise and contrast to noise ratios; density homogeneity racio between LA and LAA)., RESULTS: We found a significant radiation dose as well as contrast dose reduction between the first and last subgroups (G1: 5,6mSv and 100ml; G2: 1,3mSv and 90ml; G3: 0,6mSv and 65ml). Even though group 3 had less radiation and contrast used it still had better quantitative image quality (signal/noise of 13,5; contrast/noise 14,8; density homogeneity racio of 0,92)., CONCLUSION: Protocol optimization and technology both contributed to significant lower radiation dose and contrast volume used on cardiac CTs prior to AF ablation, without compromising image quality.

1184,2422,"Assessment of Jugular Venous Blood Flow Stasis and Thrombosis during Spaceflight Importance: Exposure to a weightless environment during spaceflight results in a chronic headward blood and tissue fluid shift compared with the upright posture on Earth, with unknown consequences to cerebral venous outflow. Objective(s): To assess internal jugular vein (IJV) flow and morphology during spaceflight and to investigate if lower body negative pressure is associated with reversing the headward fluid shift experienced during spaceflight. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This prospective cohort study included 11 International Space Station crew members participating in long-duration spaceflight missions. Internal jugular vein measurements from before launch and approximately 40 days after landing were acquired in 3 positions: seated, supine, and 15degree head-down tilt. In-flight IJV measurements were acquired at approximately 50 days and 150 days into spaceflight during normal spaceflight conditions as well as during use of lower body negative pressure. Data were analyzed in June 2019. Exposures: Posture changes on Earth, spaceflight, and lower body negative pressure. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ultrasonographic assessments of IJV cross-sectional area, pressure, blood flow, and thrombus formation. Result(s): The 11 healthy crew members included in the study (mean [SD] age, 46.9 [6.3] years, 9 [82%] men) spent a mean (SD) of 210 (76) days in space. Mean IJV area increased from 9.8 (95% CI,-1.2 to 20.7) mm2 in the preflight seated position to 70.3 (95% CI, 59.3-81.2) mm2 during spaceflight (P <.001). Mean IJV pressure increased from the preflight seated position measurement of 5.1 (95% CI, 2.5-7.8) mm Hg to 21.1 (95% CI, 18.5-23.7) mm Hg during spaceflight (P <.001). Furthermore, stagnant or reverse flow in the IJV was observed in 6 crew members (55%) on approximate flight day 50. Notably, 1 crew member was found to have an occlusive IJV thrombus, and a potential partial IJV thrombus was identified in another crew member retrospectively. Lower body negative pressure was associated with improved blood flow in 10 of 17 sessions (59%) during spaceflight. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found stagnant and retrograde blood flow associated with spaceflight in the IJVs of astronauts and IJV thrombosis in at least 1 astronaut, a newly discovered risk associated with spaceflight. Lower body negative pressure may be a promising countermeasure to enhance venous blood flow in the upper body during spaceflight.Copyright © 2019 JAMA Network Open.",Excluded,0.17483157
1186,2424,"Elevated Radiation Exposure Associated With Above Surface Flat Detector Mini C-Arm Use Background: This study aims to test the hypothesis that: (1) radiation exposure is increased with the intended use of Flat Surface Image Intensifier (FSII) units above the operative surface compared with the traditional below-table configuration; (2) this differential increases in a dose-dependent manner; and (3) radiation exposure varies with body part and proximity to the radiation source. Methods: A surgeon mannequin was seated at a radiolucent hand table, positioned for volar distal radius plating. Thermoluminescent dosimeters measured exposure to the eyes, thyroid, chest, hand, and groin, for 1- and 15-minute trials from a mini C-arm FSII unit positioned above and below the operating surface. Background radiation was measured by control dosimeters placed within the operating theater. Results: At 1-minute of exposure, hand and eye dosages were significantly greater with the flat detector positioned above the table. At 15-minutes of exposure, hand radiation dosage exceeded that of all other anatomic sites with the FSII in both positions. Hand exposure was increased in a dose-dependent manner with the flat detector in either position, whereas groin exposure saw a dose-dependent only with the flat detector beneath the operating table. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the surgeon's hands and eyes may incur greater radiation exposure compared with other body parts, during routine mini C-arm FSII utilization in its intended position above the operating table. The clinical impact of these findings remains unclear, and future long-term radiation safety investigation is warranted. Surgeons should take precautions to protect critical body parts, particularly when using FSII technology above the operating with prolonged exposure time.",Excluded,0.17303966
1187,2425,"Analysis of Patients Unable to Undergo Adjuvant Chemotherapy after Surgery in Stage IIIA/B Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Will They Benefit from Mediastinal Radiotherapy? Objectives The role of postoperative mediastinal radiotherapy in completely resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pathological N2 disease is controversial. In clinical practice, not all lung cancer patients with histologically confirmed N2 disease and a high risk for local recurrence are able to undergo postoperative concurrent radio/chemotherapy due to their physical condition or postoperative morbidities. Mediastinal radiotherapy is less compromising than a combination of radio/chemotherapy and seems likely to be tolerable for limited patients to achieve better local tumor control. Materials and Methods All patients included in this retrospective analysis were excluded from postoperative adjuvant combination chemo/radiotherapy due to their comorbidity, advanced age, or a complicated postoperative course. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy of the mediastinal lymph node stations (mean dose: 50 Gy; range: 50-54 Gy) in patients with R0 resection, additional boost of 10 Gy in patients with R1 or R2 resection, was performed postoperatively. Results A total of 110 patients were included in this analysis. Mean survival was 25.5 +/- 19.2 months. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival was 75.4, 38.7, and 26.2%, respectively. Postoperative complications and the development of distant metastases did not correlate (p = 0.7). Distant metastases proved to be a significant prognostic factor of survival (p < 0.0001). Local recurrence was seen in a total of three patients (2.7%). Five-year survival of patients developing major postoperative complications was significantly inferior (p = 0.04) to those without postoperative complications. The extent of surgery had a significant impact on survival-5-year survival after lobectomy was significantly longer than after pneumonectomy (p = 0.029). R1 resection had no significant impact on the survival rates (p = 0.67). Discussion Stage III-N2 NSCLC patients with multiple comorbidities or a complicated postoperative course after surgery may benefit from modern mediastinal radiotherapy. Surgery and postoperative mediastinal radiotherapy can achieve local tumor control. Distant metastases have the highest impact on the prognosis. Pneumonectomy, however, should be avoided in stage III NSCLC, when possible. Copyright Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York.",Excluded,0.29988486

1190,2428,"Safety of deferred CT imaging of intoxicated patients presenting with possible traumatic brain injury BACKGROUND: Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with altered mental status and alcohol intoxication can clinically resemble patients with an intracranial hemorrhage. Although intracranial hemorrhage is quickly excluded with a head computed tomographic (CT) scan, it is common practice to defer imaging and allow the patient to metabolize to spare ED resources and minimize radiation exposure to the patient. Although this reduces unnecessary scans, it may delay treatment in patients with occult intracranial hemorrhage, which some fear may increase morbidity and mortality. We sought to evaluate the safety of deferred CT imaging in these patients by evaluating whether time to scan significantly affects the rate of neurosurgical intervention., METHODS: In this retrospective medical record review, all clinically alcohol-intoxicated patients presenting to 2 university EDs were included. Time to order CT imaging, findings on imaging, and outcomes of these patients were determined. Patients were assessed in 3 groups: CT ordered within 1 hour of triage, CT ordered 1-3 hours from triage, and CT ordered 3 or more hours from triage., RESULTS: During the study period, 5943 patients were included in the study. Of these, 0 patients scanned in less than 3 hours had intracranial findings on imaging requiring neurosurgery, whereas 1 patient with a deferred CT scan required a neurosurgical intervention; however, it was not emergently performed., CONCLUSION: Routine CT scanning of alcohol-intoxicated patients with altered mental status is of low clinical value.

For that purpose, rats were divided into 4 groups. JNJ7777120 and JNJ7777120-irradiated groups received a daily subcutaneous JNJ7777120 injection (10 mg/kg) starting 24 h before irradiation. Irradiated groups received a single dose of 5 Gy on whole-body using Cesium-137 source and were sacrificed 3 or 30 days after irradiation. Tissues were removed, fixed, stained with hematoxylin and eosin or PAS staining and histological characteristics were evaluated. Proliferative and apoptotic markers were studied by immunohistochemistry, while micronucleus assay was performed to evaluate DNA damage. Submandibular gland (SMG) function was evaluated by methacholine-induced salivation. Results indicate that JNJ7777120 treatment diminished mucosal atrophy and preserved villi and the number of crypts after radiation exposure (240+/-8 vs. 165+/-10, P<0.01). This effect was associated to a reduced apoptosis and DNA damage in intestinal crypts. JNJ7777120 reduced radiation-induced aplasia, preserving medullar components and reducing formation of micronucleus and also it accelerated bone marrow repopulation. Furthermore, it reduced micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood (27+/-8 vs. 149+/-22, in 1,000 erythrocytes, P<0.01). JNJ7777120 completely reversed radiation-induced reduced salivation, conserving glandular mass with normal histological appearance and reducing apoptosis and atrophy of SMG.

The aim is to study the sun-protective behavior of Danish outdoor workers at work, at leisure, and on sun holiday and compare it to that of indoor workers. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional study, based on a 53-item survey completed by Danish outdoor (n = 380) and indoor workers (n = 119) in 2016-2017. Status as outdoor or indoor worker was decided based on self-report and behavioral differences were tested using (paired) t tests and multiple regression adjusted for age, sex, educational level, history of smoking, and skin type. Result(s): Danish outdoor workers at work use sun protection less than they do at leisure and on sun holiday (alpha <.05) where their sun protection behavior is similar to that of indoor workers. The proportion of Danish outdoor workers that always/often use sun protection at work is for shade seeking around noon 4.2%, sunscreen 34.5%, wide-brimmed hat 25.3%, and long trousers and shirt with sleeves 42.4%. Of Danish outdoor workers, 49.5% do not think about the risk of occupational skin cancer and 11.8% think the risk is insignificant, 32.4% think that the use of sun protection is of low or no importance, 84.2% consider sunburn important as skin cancer risk factor still 88.9% have a history of sunburn at work, > 80.0% agree that risk of skin cancer is reduced by the use of sun protection, and only 4.0% dismiss the possibility of sun protection use at work.

1197,2435,"Falling back to earth: Altered splanchnic vasoreactivity may contribute to microgravity-induced orthostatic intolerance The adaptations of the human cardiovascular system to microgravity, which are well tolerated while in space, can lead to dizziness, blurred vision, and fainting upon reentry. Specifically, orthostatic hypotension, a fall in blood pressure upon standing, poses a major problem for astronauts returning to Earth, and presents a hazard should an emergency ever arise during landing. Female astronauts are affected more frequently than males, suggesting underlying gender-related differences in cardiovascular regulation. One such difference has already been demonstrated: in response to an orthostatic challenge, males experience blood pooling primarily in the legs, while females show much more blood pooling in the abdominal region. Normally, the splanchnic blood vessels should reflexively constrict, initiating mobilization of the blood to supply the brain. In order to determine whether attenuation of this reflex is responsible for post-flight orthostatic intolerance (particularly in females), we examined in vitro vascular reactivity in male and female rats subjected to simulated microgravity (hind-limb unloading; HLU). The constrictor response of third-order mesenteric blood vessels to phenylephrine was measured by wire myograph. The sensitivity of female arteries to phenylephrine was attenuated following HLU. Maximal tensile response to phenylephrine was unchanged in these vessels, while maximal tensile response to high KCI increased. In male arteries, HLU did not significantly change any of these parameters. These results indicate that, after HLU, the mesenteric arteries of females (but not males) can be expected to show reduced sensitivity to noradrenergic sympathetic outflow. This may partially underlie the gender disparity in post-flight orthostatic hypotension.",Excluded,0.19009517
1198,2436,"Impact of Vessel Suppressed-CT on Diagnostic Accuracy in Detection of Pulmonary Metastasis and Reading Time Rationale and Objectives: To assess if vessel suppression (VS) improves nodule detection rate, interreader agreement, and reduces reading time in oncologic chest computed tomography (CT). Material(s) and Method(s): One-hundred consecutive oncologic patients (65 male; median age 60y) who underwent contrast-enhanced chest CT were retrospectively included. For all exams, additional VS series (ClearRead CT, Riverrain Technologies, Miamisburg) were reconstructed. Two groups of three radiologists each with matched experience were defined. Each group evaluated the SD-CT as well as VS-CT. Each reader marked the presence, size, and position of pulmonary nodules and documented reading time. In addition, for the VS-CT the presence of false positive nodules had to be stated. Cohen's Kappa (k) was used to calculate the interreader-agreement between groups. Reading time was compared using paired t test. Result(s): Nodule detection rate was significantly higher in VS-CT compared to the SD-CT (+21%; p <0.001). Interreader-agreement was higher in the VS-CT (k = 0.431, moderate agreement) compared to SD-CT (k = 0.209, fair agreement). Almost all VS-CT series had false positive findings (97-99 out of 100). Average reading time was significantly shorter in the VS-CT compared to the SD-CT (154 +/- 134vs. 194 +/- 126; 21%, p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Vessel suppression increases nodule detection rate, improves interreader agreement, and reduces reading time in chest CT of oncologic patients. Due to false positive results a consensus reading with the SD-CT is essential.Copyright © 2020 The Association of University Radiologists",Excluded,0.17124157

A 16-MDCT scanner (Somatom Sensation 16) was used. Forty patients were examined at 120 kVp and 120 effective mAs (supine) and 40 effective mAs (prone) using online x- and y-axis tube current modulation. Another 40 patients were scanned using combined x-, y-, and z-axis tube current modulation. Individual patient radiation exposure was determined using the dose-length product. Image noise was determined by Hounsfield unit measurements in the colonic lumen at four anatomic levels. Image quality was rated on a 5-point confidence scale by two independent reviewers. The unpaired Student's t test (for radiation dose, image noise) and Wilcoxon's test (for image quality) were used to test for statistically significant differences between these values., RESULTS: Radiation dose was significantly lower in the patient group scanned with x-, y-, and z-axis tube current modulation than in the group scanned with x- and y-axis tube current modulation (supine: 4.24 vs 6.50 mSv, p < 0.0001; prone: 1.61 vs 2.38 mSv, p < 0.0001).

Histology: adenocarcinoma (49%), squamous cell carcinoma (32%), other (19%). Patients were mostly stage IIIB (50.4%), T3/T4 (53.7%), N2 (64%) and N3 (28%), and were ECOG 0 (33%), 1 (56%), and 2 (11%) at diagnosis. CT included platinum doublets (94%), weekly (52%), induction (12%) and consolidative (22%) therapy. Median OS was 26 months and 2-yr survival was 58.1%. The 2-yr OS for IIIA and IIIB patients was 61.8% and 42.4%, respectively. The overall 2-yr LF, RF, and DF rates were 30.4%, 32.9% and 54.9%, respectively. 2-yr DFS was 28.8%. In UVA, ECOG predicted for LF (PZ0.004) and RF (PZ0.006). DF was associated with N stage (N0/1/2 vs. N3; P = 0.013), ECOG (P = 0.03) and IIIA vs. IIIB (P = 0.011). N stage (P = 0.041), ECOG (PZ0.0001) and overall stage (PZ0.007) were predictive of DFS. Stage (P = 0.003) and ECOG (P = 0.002) predicted for improved OS. ECOG was significant on MVA for LF, RF, DF, DFS and OS, while N stage was predictive for RF, DF, DFS and OS. Toxicity was manageable: 10.6% had Grade 3 esophagitis and 15.7% and 1.9% had Grade 2 or 3 pneumonitis with no Grade 4/5 events. Esophageal ulceration and dilation rates were 16.2% and 10.6%, respectively. Esophagitis grade was predictive of ulceration (P = 0.0001) or dilation (P = 0.0001). N stage (P = 0.008) and overall stage (P = 0.022) were predictive of pneumonitis grade. Conclusion(s): Patients in our cohort were frailer and had more advanced disease than the 0617 patients. Despite this, we demonstrate that CT with an intermediate RT dose of 70 Gy leads to better outcomes than the 74 Gy arm in RTOG 0617 with less esophageal toxicity. Preliminary analysis suggests that omission of ECOG-2 patients leads to superior outcomes for 70 Gy compared with the 60 Gy patients in 0617; analysis is ongoing. ECOG was a major determinant of survival outcomes.",Excluded,0.17145579
1201,2439,"Risk of isolated nodal failure for stage III NSCLC treated with selective nodal irradiation using IMRT Purpose/Objective: PET-CT based selective nodal irradiation in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients using 3D conformal radiotherapy (RT) results in less than 5% of isolated nodal failures (INF), possibly due to a significant incidental nodal dose. Intensity modulated RT (IMRT) is increasingly used, but decreases the dose to adjacent lymph nodes significantly. This may lead to a higher incidence of INF. We therefore investigated the INF rate in IMRT-treated patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients charts from the prospective MAASTRO database were reviewed. Stage III NSCLC patients treated with radical IMRT based RT alone or in combination with sequential (seqCRT) or concurrent (conCRT) chemotherapy were included. An individualized accelerated isotoxic radiotherapy (INDAR) as previously published (JCO 2010; Eur J Cancer 2012) was applied. The primary tumour and FDG-PETpositive and/or cytologically proven lymph nodes were delineated on a 3D-PET-CT fused with a 4D-CT. Follow up (FU) consisted of regular imaging (X-ray and CT) and if clinically indicated. In case of a recurrence, the diagnostic image was compared with the radiation plan. Local tumour and nodal recurrences were scored as follows: in field: at least a part of the recurrence inside the original CTV and out of field: recurrence completely outside the original CTV. Out of field nodal recurrences were classified as recurrences in adjacent or non-adjacent lymph node stations. Overall Survival (OS) and Progression Free Survival (PFS) were calculated from date of pathological diagnosis (Kaplan- Meier). Result(s): From January 2010 until March 2012, 183 patients were included: 119 males, 64 females, median age 68.0 years (Stage IIIA 51.9%, IIIB 48.1%). Median total tumour dose was 69.0 +/- 5.1 Gy (50.4- 73.8 Gy) in a median overall treatment time of 35.0 days. Most patient received chemo-radiation (n=116 conCRT, n=45 seqCRT), while 22 received RT alone. With a median FU of 17.5 months (26.7 months for patients alive) the median OS was 19.0 months (95% CI 16.6-21.4 months) with a 2-year OS of 40.2% (actuarial 2-year OS 38%) for the entire group, 20.2 months for conCRT and 16.0 months for seqCRT (p=0.45). Median PFS was 15.1 months (95% CI 11.3-18.8 months) with a 2-year PFS of 35.3% (actuarial 2-year PFS 34%) for the entire group, 14.1 months for conCRT and 15.7 months for seqCRT (p=0.84). Ninety-nine patients (54.1%) showed recurrent disease: 9.3% (n=17) local recurrence, 1.6% (n=3) isolated nodal recurrence, 2.2% (n=4) loco-regional recurrence, 26.8% (n=49) distant metastases only and 14.2% (n=26) a combination of local/loco-regional and distant metastases. The distribution of all recurrences is depicted in table 1. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): Selective PET-based mediastinal nodal irradiation using IMRT in patients with stage III NSCLC seems to result in a low percentage of isolated nodal failure (1.6%), although FU is still limited. These results are in line with earlier published 3D conformal RT data.",Excluded,0.17252229
1206,2444,"Evaluation of the reticulocyte micronucleus assay in patients treated with radioiodine for thyroid cancer In the case of accidental radiation exposure, biological dosimetry has an important role. Previous studies have indicated that the flow cytometric micronucleus (MN) assay in human transferrin receptor positive reticulocytes (Tf-Ret) in blood could be a sensitive biomarker for chromosome damage. In the present investigation, the utility and sensitivity of this method was studied in 44 young patients from Belarus, who were treated with 131I for thyroid cancer. Red marrow (RM) is the critical organ in radioiodine therapy (RIT). In our patients, it was exposed to 100-700 mSv low-dose rate irradiation within 2-4 days. About 3 days after 131I administration, the frequency of micronucleated-Tf-Ret (f(MN-Tf-Ret)) increases within 1 day to a maximum and declines in the following 2-5 days to its value before treatment. A total dose of 100 mSv was easily detectable. The sensitivity of the assay after acute irradiation may be 50 mSv. The method should be useful for monitoring individuals after a radiation accident, provided blood samples can be obtained within a few days after exposure. The time-course of f(MN-Tf-Ret) is interpreted using a model, which considers the exponential exposure of red marrow in RIT as well as the kinetics of erythroblast maturation and reticulocyte migration into the peripheral circulation. Similar modelling was done on published data of MN in immature mouse erythrocytes. Striking similarities in the kinetic and in the yield of MN-induction were found between these two species. This lends support for the use of the mouse as a model for the MN-induction in humans.",Excluded,0.7799665
1207,2445,"In-vivo longitudinal imaging of microvascular changes in irradiated oral mucosa of radiotherapy cancer patients using optical coherence tomography Mucositis is the limiting toxicity of radio(chemo)therapy of head and neck cancer. Diagnostics, prophylaxis and correction of this condition demand new accurate and objective approaches. Here we report on an in vivo longitudinal monitoring of the oral mucosa dynamics in 25 patients during the course of radiotherapy of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal cancer using multifunctional optical coherence tomography (OCT). A spectral domain OCT system with a specially-designed oral imaging probe was used. Microvasculature visualization was based on temporal speckle variations of the full complex signal evaluated by high-pass filtering of 3D data along the slow scan axis. Angiographic image quantification demonstrated an increase of the vascular density and total length of capillary-like-vessels before visual signs or clinical symptoms of mucositis occur. Especially significant microvascular changes compared to their initial levels occurred when grade two and three mucositis developed. Further, microvascular reaction was seen to be dose-level dependent. OCT monitoring in radiotherapy offers a non-invasive, convenient, label-free quantifiable structural and functional volumetric imaging method suitable for longitudinal human patient studies, furnishing fundamental radiobiological insights and potentially providing useful feedback data to enable adaptive radiotherapy (ART).",Excluded,0.7710706

1213,2452,"Comparison of a reduced radiation fluoroscopy protocol to conventional fluoroscopy during uncomplicated ureteroscopy Objectives: Although the long-term effects of radiation exposure are not completely predictable, the principle of keeping radiation exposure ""as low as reasonably achievable"" should be used. The purpose of this study was to compare fluoroscopy times before and after the implementation of a protocol designed to reduce fluoroscopy usage during ureteroscopy. Method(s): A retrospective review was conducted of 300 consecutive ureteroscopy patients at a single institution. Patients undergoing simple ureteroscopy without ancillary procedures or balloon dilation were further evaluated to determine the effect of a reduced fluoroscopy protocol. The protocol included several measures, including use of a laser-guided C-arm, use of a designated fluoroscopy technician and substitution of visual for fluoroscopic cues during ureteroscopy. Fluoroscopy times were compared between groups using a paired t test with P <.05 considered significant. Result(s): Ureteroscopy cases before protocol implementation (n = 30) were compared with procedures after implementation (n = 30). Stone size and location were similar between groups. Protocol implementation significantly reduced the mean fluoroscopy exposure from 86.1 seconds (range 30-300) to 15.5 seconds (range 0-54; P <.001). There was no difference in mean operative time (74.2 vs 65.1 minutes; P =.14), or complications (2 patients vs 2 patients; P = 1) between groups. No complication in either group could be ascribed to the fluoroscopic technique. Conclusion(s): The reduced fluoroscopy protocol resulted in an 82% reduction in fluoroscopy time without altering patient outcomes. These simple radiation-reducing techniques add no technical difficulty and improve safety for the patient, surgeon, and operating room staff by lowering radiation exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.17187615
1214,2453,"A functional evaluation of pincer femoroacetabular impingement in asymptomatic adults Introduction: Pincer femoroacetabular impingement, defined as acetabular overcoverage of the femoral head, is a frequent anomaly of the hip in young adults, which has recently been incriminated in the development of early-onset hip osteoarthritis [1]. While most studies have only explored this phenomenon in a static position [2], it is still not known how the overcoverage of the femoral head by the acetabulum relates to gait. The aim was to examine whether acetabular parameters implicated in the development of femoroacetabular impingement correlate to self-selected and fast speed gait in asymptomatic adults. Research question: Is pincer femoroacetabular impingement related to self-selected and/or fast speed gait in asymptomatic adults? Methods: 28 asymptomatic adult subjects (age = 21.2 +/- 1.7, 19M & 9F) with no prior orthopaedic treatment underwent full body EOS biplanar X-rays with 3D reconstruction of the pelvis and lower limbs. The following acetabular parameters were subsequently generated: coverage of the femoral head by the acetabulum (CovFH in %), acetabular anterior coverage angle (ACov), acetabular anteversion (AAnt) and abduction (AAb). The gait of all subjects was assessed using 3D gait analysis during self-selected and fast speed gait in order to determine lower limb kinematic and spatio-temporal parameters of gait. In order to understand which acetabular parameters most relate to gait kinematics and spatio-temporel parameters, stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) was applied during both self-selected and fast gait. Result(s): Walking speed significantly differed (p < 0.001) between self-selected (1.2 +/- 0.2 m/s) and fast speed gait (2.1 +/- 0.3 m/s). SMLR revealed that walking speed was determined (Adj. R2 = 0.25; p < 0.001) by both CovFH (beta = -0.53) and height (beta = 0.29) during fast speed gait. Walking speed was independent of all skeletal parameters during self-selected speed gait. Step length was determined (Adj. R2 = 0.51; p < 0.001) by both height (beta = 0.76) and CovFH (beta = -0.22) during fast speed gait but only by height (b = 0.34) during self-selected speed gait. Moreover, maximal hip extension during stance was solely determined by Acov during both self-selected and fast speed gait (b = 0.45 and 0.51 respectively). Discussion(s): This is the first study to show that hip morphology affects spatio-temporal characteristics of gait during fast but not self-selected speed gait in asymptomatic adults. Walking speed and step length decreased with increased acetabular coverage of the femoral head during fast but not self-selected speed gait. Moreover, maximal hip extension during stance was diminished with decreasing anterior coverage. These findings suggest that relative acetabular overcoverage of the femoral head limits maximal hip extension during gait, probably through posterior femoroacetabular impingement, but that this only limits walking speed during fast and not self-selected speed gait.

Method(s): 5 polymorphic gene variants (rs1048943, rs4646421, rs2070676, rs3813867, rs1695) were studied in 399 people living in the East Kazakhstan region in this research. 248 people of the 2nd-3rd generation lived in the territory with radiation exposure in Abai, Borodulikha areas, and 151 people the comparison group lived in Kurchum district without radiation exposure comparable in sex and age with control group. Result(s): The results show that there is a significant association of rs1048943 in exposed and unexposed groups (p < 0.003), and the absence of association of rs4646421, rs2070676, rs3813867, rs1695 in the studied groups. The mean value of thyroxine in carriers of the AG + GG genotype of rs4646421 is significantly lower than in AA genotype carriers (p = 0.04); no significant changes were found in genotypes' distribution with thyroid-stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid peroxidase indicators. Significant changes were in levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase between exposed and unexposed groups (p = 0.007). The thyroxine-thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were not significantly different in exposed and unexposed groups (p > 0.3).

Thyroxine levels decrease was identified in the 2nd and 3rd generation residents of the exposed area, as well as a significant increase of anti-thyroid peroxidase occurs in individuals of the 2nd and 3rd generation living in areas with radiation exposure.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded,0.95312375
1219,2458,"Retrograde nailing arthrodesis in distal leg deformities Introduction Distal leg and ankle deformities lead to progressive degeneration of the distal tibia and astragalic articular surfaces. When the cartilagineous degeneration is severe, or it is not possible to surgically correct the bone deformity, arthrodesis is the only surgical operation that is able to restore functionality. Retrograde nailing is a stable synthesis that leads to rapid healing of the bone surfaces, and precocious recovery. We assessed its application in articular distal tibia and ankle axial deviations. Methods Between 2007 and 2012 we studied a group of 25 patients, 14 women and 11 men, mean age 43 years (min 31, max 74), affected by distal leg and ankle deformities.We divided them in 2 groups depending on the deformity site (tibia 11 patients, talus bone 14 patients). We assessed the surgical access, the corrective osteotomy site, the cancellous bone graft, the healing time through a modified AOFAS score and X-rays, with a 3 years follow-up. Weight bearing was allowed 35 days post-operatively. The bone graft was harvested through peroneal malleolus resection, with the same lateral surgical access. Results In all patients we achieved deformity correction. Bone consolidation occurred in 90 days. Nailing and preparation of the articular surfaces was associated to subtractive osteotomies in 9 cases. Five tibial osteotomies were performed mostly in post-traumatic deformities, 4 talus osteotomies mostly in degenerative deformities. A thin layer of cancellous bone graft was used 18 patients. Mean preoperative AOFAS score was 37. At the 12-month follow-up, the score increased to 80, and it was maintained in the following examinations. Discussion Retrograde nailing tibiotarsic arthrodesis with osteotomies is able to correct complex deformities with severe articular damage. Nailing makes this treatment more tolerable for patients comparing to techniques such as external fixation. Subtractive osteotomies or subtalar joint re-alignment are necessary in cases of severe rear foot deformities that prevent nail insertion. Conclusions Retrograde nailing arthrodesis allows a complete correction of distal tibia and ankle articular deformities, a rapid consolidation and a precocious functional recovery.",Excluded,0.17181103

1221,2461,"[Topical application of vitamins, phytosterols and ceramides. Protection against increased expression of interstital collagenase and reduced collagen-I expression after single exposure to UVA irradiation] Photoaged skin is characterized by a decrease of dermal collagen fibers, resulting from an increased breakdown and a diminished de novo synthesis. The increased breakdown results from an increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The main building blocks involved in de novo synthesis of collagen fibers are collagen 1A1 and 1A2, the expression of which is reduced in photoaged skin. We studied the effect of topical application of vitamins, phytosterols and ceramides on UV-induced up-regulation of the expression of MMP-1 and on UV-induced down-regulation of COL1A1 and COL1A2. The study was conducted with 10 subjects with healthy skin who were comparatively treated for 10 days with (i) a basic preparation containing jojoba oil, (ii) the basic preparation supplemented with vitamins, (iii) the basic preparation supplemented with phytosterols and ceramides, and (iv) the basic preparation supplemented with vitamins, phytosterols and ceramides. All four preparations inhibited the UV induced up-regulation of MMP-1. Neither the basic product nor that supplemented with vitamins inhibited down-regulation of COL1A1 and COL1A2, but addition of phytosterols and ceramides caused a decreased down-regulation of the expression of these genes. Our results indicate that phytosterols and ceramides are effective in blocking the reduced collagen synthesis after UV irradiation and even stimulating synthesis.

The primary aim of this study was to show that joint preparation for DIP fusion is not necessary in cases of stage IV chondropathy. The secondary aim was to show that use of buried compression screws decreases the complication rate. This continuous retrospective study included two groups of DIP percutaneous arthrodesis procedures carried out with 1.8. mm break-away compression screws: group 1 underwent joint preparation through a dorsal approach and group 2 underwent a percutaneous procedure without joint preparation. Group 1 included 15 patients (18 fingers) with a mean age of 65.3 years, representing nine cases of osteoarthritis, four cases of open trauma, one of gout, and one of rheumatoid arthritis. Group 2 included 18 patients (21 fingers) with a mean age of 58.9 years, representing 16 cases of osteoarthritis, one of rheumatoid arthritis and one of swan-neck deformity. Tourniquet time was longer in group 1 (61. min) than in group 2 (24. min). The amount of emitted ionizing radiation was not different between groups. Pain and QuickDASH scores were not improved in group 1 but they were in group 2. There was no difference in the fusion time. One non-union was observed in group 1.

The analysis of cosmonauts' response times showed that the mental rotation task is not greatly impaired in weightlessness. On the contrary, there are indications of a facilitation as: (1) the average rotation time per degree was shorter inflight than on the ground; (2) this difference seemed to be particularly marked for stimuli calling for roll axis rotations. However several factors may be responsible for this difference which was not obvious in one subject.

The aim of this study is to compare prospectively in a single, high-volume center the outcome of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ablation performed specifically by second-generation cryoballoon or contact force radiofrequency ablation., METHODS: Consecutive patients scheduled for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation have been included and prospectively followed up. Aiming to reduce potential bias deriving from baseline characteristics, a propensity score matching analysis has been performed to analyze safety and efficacy outcomes., RESULTS: Out of consecutive patients undergoing atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation between January 2015 and December 2016, 46 patients approached by cryoablation were matched 1 : 1 by propensity score to a similar population treated by last-generation radiofrequency ablation. Freedom from atrial fibrillation after 12 months (76 vs. 78%, P = 0.804) and incidence of complications (4 vs. 6%, P = 0.168) did not differ between the two groups. Radiological exposure was higher for the cryoballoon group (11 vs. 4 min, P < 0.001), whereas procedural duration did not differ (P = 0.174). Aiming to assess the potential impact of a learning curve in patients undergoing cryoablation, the first-third of patients (n = 15) were compared with the remaining, reporting longer radiological exposure (P < 0.001), but similar safety and efficacy., CONCLUSION: In this propensity score analysis, last-generation cryoballoon and radiofrequency catheters for atrial fibrillation ablation present similar efficacy and safety.

1237,2480,"Reducing intraoperative duration and ionising radiation exposure during the insertion of distal locking screws of intramedullary nails: a small-scale study comparing the current fluoroscopic method against radiation-free, electromagnetic navigation BACKGROUND: Intramedullary nailing is the standard surgical treatment for mid-diaphyseal fractures of long bones; however, it is also a high radiation dose procedure. Distal locking is regularly cited as a demanding element of the procedure, and there remains a reliance on X-ray fluoroscopy to locate the distal holes. A recently developed electromagnetic navigation (EMN) system allows radiation-free distal locking, with a virtual on-screen image., OBJECTIVE: To compare operative duration, fluoroscopy time and radiation dose when using EMN over fluoroscopy, for the distal locking of intramedullary nails., METHOD: Consecutive patients with mid-diaphyseal fractures of the tibia and femur, treatable with intramedullary nails, were prospectively enrolled during a 9-month period. The sample consisted of 29 individuals, 19 under fluoroscopic guidance and 10 utilising EMN. Participants were allocated depending on the type of intramedullary nail used and surgeon's preference. These were further divided into tibial and femoral subcategories, relative to the fracture site., RESULTS: EMN reduced fluoroscopy time by 49 (p = 0.038) and 28 s during tibial and femoral nailings, respectively. Radiation dose was reduced by 18 cGy/cm2 (p = 0.046) during tibial and 181 cGy/cm2 during femoral nailings when utilising EMN. Operative duration was 11 min slower during tibial nailings using EMN, but 38 min faster in respect of femoral nailings., CONCLUSIONS: This study has evidenced statistically significant reductions in both fluoroscopy time and radiation dose when using EMN for the distal locking of intramedullary nails. It is expected that overall operative duration would also decrease in line with similar studies, with increased usage and a larger sample.",Excluded,0.17217846
