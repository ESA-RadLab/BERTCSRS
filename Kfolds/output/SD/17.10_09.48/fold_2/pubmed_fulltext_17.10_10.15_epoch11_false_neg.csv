The fraction of cancer attributable to lifestyle and environmental factors in the UK in 2010 This chapter summarises the results of the preceding sections, which estimate the fraction of cancers occurring in the UK in 2010 that can be attributed to sub-optimal, past exposures of 14 lifestyle and environmental risk factors. For each of 18 cancer types, we present the percentage of cases attributable to one or all of the risk factors considered (tobacco, alcohol, four elements of diet (consumption of meat, fruit and vegetables, fibre, and salt), overweight, lack of physical exercise, occupation, infections, radiation (ionising and solar), use of hormones, and reproductive history (breast feeding)).Exposure to less than optimum levels of the 14 factors was responsible for 42.7% of cancers in the UK in 2010 (45.3% in men, 40.1% in women)-a total of about 134 000 cases.Tobacco smoking is by far the most important risk factor for cancer in the UK, responsible for 60 000 cases (19.4% of all new cancer cases) in 2010. The relative importance of other exposures differs by sex. In men, deficient intake of fruits and vegetables (6.1%), occupational exposures (4.9%) and alcohol consumption (4.6%) are next in importance, while in women, it is overweight and obesity (because of the effect on breast cancer)-responsible for 6.9% of cancers, followed by infectious agents (3.7%).Population- attributable fractions provide a valuable quantitative appraisal of the impact of different factors in cancer causation, and are thus helpful in prioritising cancer control strategies. However, quantifying the likely impact of preventive interventions requires rather complex scenario modelling, including specification of realistically achievable population distributions of risk factors, and the timescale of change, as well as the latent periods between exposure and outcome, and the rate of change following modification in exposure level. © 2011 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.",Included,0.12262766
26,"The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in the local management of desmoplastic melanoma BACKGROUND In the current study, the authors sought to evaluate outcomes, specifically with respect to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), for patients with desmoplastic melanoma. METHODS The records of 130 consecutive patients who presented between 1985 and 2009 with nonmetastatic desmoplastic melanoma and were treated curatively with either surgery alone (59 patients; 45%) or surgery and postoperative RT (71 patients; 55%) were retrospectively reviewed. Ages ranged from 21 years to 97 years (median age, 66 years). The location of the primary tumor was in the head and neck region in 62% of patients. Only 5 patients (4%) had lymph node involvement at the time of presentation. RESULTS The median follow-up was 6.6 years (range, 11 months-24 years). Overall survival rates at 5 years and 10 years were 69% and 53%, respectively. Disease-specific survival rates were 84% and 80%, respectively, at 5 years and 10 years. The actuarial rate of local recurrence was 17% at 5 years and beyond. Of the patients who underwent surgery without receiving postoperative RT, 14 (24%) experienced local recurrence. Of the 71 patients treated with surgery and postoperative RT, 5 (7%) experienced local recurrence. In a Cox multivariate regression model, improved local control was significantly associated with the receipt of postoperative RT (P = .009). CONCLUSIONS Surgery followed by postoperative RT appears to provide superior local control compared with surgery alone for patients with desmoplastic melanoma.

977,"Three-dimensional conformal versus non-graphic radiation treatment planning for apocrine gland adenocarcinoma of the anal sac in 18 dogs (2002-2007) Differences in dose homogeneity and irradiated volumes of target and surrounding normal tissues between 3D conformal radiation treatment planning and simulated non-graphic manual treatment planning were evaluated in 18 dogs with apocrine gland adenocarcinoma of the anal sac. Overall, 3D conformal treatment planning resulted in more homogenous dose distribution to target tissues with lower hot spots and dose ranges. Dose homogeneity and guarantee of not under-dosing target tissues with 3D conformal planning came at the cost, however, of delivering greater mean doses of radiation and of irradiating greater volumes of surrounding normal tissue structures.

557,"Effects of NKG2D haplotypes on the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on natural killer and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among atomic-bomb survivors NKG2D is a primary activating receptor that triggers cell-mediated cytotoxicity in NK cells against tumor and virus-infected cells. We previously identified the NKG2D haplotypes in the natural killer gene complex region on chromosome 12p. Two major haplotype alleles, LNK1 and HNK1, were closely related to low and high natural cytotoxic activity phenotypes, respectively. Furthermore, the haplotype of HNK1/HNK1 has revealed a decreased risk of cancer compared with LNK1/LNK1. In the present study, using flow cytometry, we evaluated the functional effects of NKG2D haplotypes and five htSNPs in terms of the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among 732 atomic-bomb survivors. NKG2D expression on NK cells showed significant increases, in the order of LNK1/LNK1, LNK1/HNK1 and HNK1/HNK1 haplotypes (p for trend = 0.003), or with major homozygous, heterozygous, and minor homozygous genotypes for individual htSNPs (p for trend = 0.02-0.003). The same trend was observed for NKG2D expression on CD8 T cells. Our findings indicate that the NKG2D haplotypes are associated with the expression levels of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells, resulting in inter-individual variations in human cytotoxic response. © 2012 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.",Included,0.12884115
174,"Transcriptional corepressor MTG16 regulates small intestinal crypt proliferation and crypt regeneration after radiation-induced injury Myeloidtranslocation genes (MTGs) are transcriptional corepressorsimplicated in development, malignancy, differentiation, and stem cellfunction. While MTG16 loss renders mice sensitive to chemicalcolitis, the role of MTG16 in the small intestine is unknown. Histologicalexamination revealed that Mtg16-/- mice have increasedenterocyte proliferation and goblet cell deficiency. After exposure toradiation, Mtg16-/- mice exhibited increased crypt viability anddecreased apoptosis compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Flow cytometricand immunofluorescence analysis of intestinal epithelial cellsfor phospho-histone H2A.X also indicated decreased DNA damageand apoptosis in Mtg16-/- intestines. To determine if Mtg16 deletionaffected epithelial cells in a cell-autonomous fashion, intestinal cryptswere isolated from Mtg16-/- mice. Mtg16-/-and WT intestinalcrypts showed similar enterosphere forming efficiencies when culturedin the presence of EGF, Noggin, and R-spondin. However, whenMtg16-/- crypts were cultured in the presence of Wnt3a, theydemonstrated higher enterosphere forming efficiencies and delayedprogression to mature enteroids. Mtg16-/- intestinal crypts isolatedfrom irradiated mice exhibited increased survival compared with WTintestinal crypts. Interestingly, Mtg16 expression was reduced in astem cell-enriched population at the time of crypt regeneration. Thisis consistent with MTG16 negatively regulating regeneration in vivo.Taken together, our data demonstrate that MTG16 loss promotesradioresistance and impacts intestinal stem cell function, possibly dueto shifting cellular response away from DNA damage-induced apoptosisand towards DNA repair after injury.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.",Included,0.20184144
183,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the p53 pathway A cell culture assay has been developed that detects and validates single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that populate the p53 pathway. One hundred thirteen EBV-transformed human B-lymphocyte cell lines obtained from a diverse population were employed to measure the apoptotic response to gamma radiation. Each cell line undergoes a reproducible, characteristic frequency of apoptosis, and the response of the population forms a normal distribution around a median of 35.5% apoptosis with a range from 12% to 58% apoptosis. Polymorphisms in the AKT1 and Perp genes significantly affect the frequency of apoptosis. The assay can detect both racial and sexual dimorphisms in these genes and has the ability to demonstrate epistatic relationships within the p53 pathway. The cell lines used in this assay provide biological materials to explore the molecular basis of the polymorphisms.Copyright © 2005 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",Included,0.24646397
1149,"The characteristics of the cerebral asthenia syndrome in persons who were victims of the accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Station A total of 107 patients (81 males, 26 females), their age ranging between 34 to 45 years, diagnosed as having discirculatory encephalopathy with underlying cerebrasthenic syndrome, were examined. All the examinees took part in the elimination of the Chernobyl accident effects in 1986. It was found out, that cerebrasthenia which is present in the structure of all clinical variants of organic affection of the brain is the most mobile (functional) link of the morbid process when a disorder sets in rather than the failure of the organ to perform its function. It ranks among other asthenic syndromes reflecting a specific character of exogenous radiation effect on the organism, being a result of a characteristic interaction between the organism and a health hazard. Measures to dispel the asthenic component at the initial stages of development of the disorder will make for reduction or arrest of progression of organic symptomatology.",Included,0.2644831
413,"Low dose radiotherapy is associated with local complications but not disease control in sacral chordoma BACKGROUND: We reviewed the disease control and complications of the treatment of sacrococcygeal chordoma from four tertiary cancer centers with emphasis on the effects of radiotherapy in surgically treated patients., METHODS: A total of 193 patients with primary sacrococcygeal chordoma from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed. There were 124 males, with a mean age of 59 +/- 15 years and a mean follow-up of 7 +/- 4 years. Eighty-nine patients received radiotherapy with a mean total dose of 61.8 +/- 10.9 Gy., RESULTS: The 10-year disease-free and disease-specific survival was 58% and 72%, respectively. Radiation was not associated with local recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-2.17; P = 0.71), metastases (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.45-1.91; P = 0.85) or disease-specific survival (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.46-2.00; P = 0.91). Higher doses (>=70 Gy; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.20-1.32; P = 0.17) may be associated with reduced local recurrence. Radiotherapy was associated with wound complications (HR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.64-4.82;, P < 0.001) and sacral stress fractures (HR, 4.73; 95% CI, 1.88-14.38; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter review, radiotherapy was not associated with tumor outcome but associated with complications. The routine use of radiotherapy with en-bloc resection of sacrococcygeal chordomas should be reconsidered in favor of a selective, individualized approach with a radiation dose of >=70 Gy.

1071,"Protein expression of nucleophosmin, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 correlates with human nasopharyngeal carcinoma radioresistance in vivo Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in the treatment of endemic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The present study aimed to identify proteins associated with radioresistance in NPC in vitro and in vivo. Proteomics analyses were conducted to screen for differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs) in parental CNE-2 cells and CNE-2R cells. Using proteomics approaches, 16 DEPs were identified. Of these DEPs, nucleophosmin (NPM1), annexin A3 and nm23-H1, were verified using western blot analyses. The tumorigenicity was investigated using mouse xenograft tumorigenicity assays, and tumor growth curves were generated. The protein expression of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 was examined by immunohistochemically staining tumor tissues. NPM1 and annexin A3 protein levels were downregulated in the CNE-2R cells, whereas nm23-H1 expression was upregulated. In vivo tests showed that compared with the CNE-2 tumors, CNE-2R tumor growth was significantly retarded (P<0.05). CNE-2 tumor progression was inhibited by irradiation, but CNE-2R tumor progression was not, indicating that the CNE-2R cells were also radioresistant in vivo. NPM1 and annexin A3 expression was significantly lower in non-irradiated (NIR)-CNE-2R tumors compared with NIR-CNE-2 tumors (P<0.01). However, Nm23-H1 protein levels were significantly higher (P<0.05). Overall, the present study established comparable radioresistant and radiosensitive tumor models of human NPC, and identified candidate biomarkers that may correlate with radioresistance. The data showed that dysregulation of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 expression correlated with the cellular and tumor radioresponse. These proteins are involved in the regulation of intracellular functions, including stress responses, cell proliferation and DNA repair. However, further clinical evaluations are required.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included,0.31231073
1155,"NOS1-, NOS3-, PIK3CA-, and MAPK pathways in skin following radiation therapy Background: Essential molecular pathways such as the MAPK pathway, NO system, or the influence of PIK3CA as an oncogene are known to regulate fundamental signalling networks. However, few knowledge about their role in the occurrence of wound healing disorders (WHD) following radiation therapy (RT) exists. This study aims to evaluate the expression profiles of specific molecular pathway marker genes. Method(s): Expression profiles of the genes encoding MAPK, NOS1, NOS3, and PIK3CA were analyzed, by RT-PCR, in specimens from patients with and without a history of RT to the head and neck. Clinical data on the occurrence of cervical WHDs were analyzed. Result(s): Expression analysis of patients with postoperative WHDs revealed a significant increase in MAPK expression compared to the control group without occurrence of postoperative WHDs. PIK3CA showed a significantly increased expression in patients with a history of RT. Expression analysis of all other investigated genes did not reveal significant differences. Conclusion(s): This current study is able to show the influence of RT on different molecular pathways. This underlines the crucial role of specific molecular networks, responsible for the occurrence of long-term radiation toxicity such as WHDs. Additional studies should be carried out to identify possible starting points for therapeutic interventions.Copyright © The Author(s). 2017.",Included,0.39199066
