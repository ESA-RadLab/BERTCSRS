605,"Effects on female fertility and germinal cells in prepubertal and adult rats (Rattus norvegicus) after X-ray irradiation In this work we analyse the effects of ionizing radiation in prepubertal and adult female rats, using as parameters, implantation sites, embryonic loss, and synaptonemal complex (SC) analysis of the female F1 of the pregnant rats. Our preliminary results show a decrease statistically significant in fertility of irradiated groups, but cytogenetic analysis did not shown any inherited damage attributed to radiation. At the same time, our results seem to indicate a higher resistance of oocytes from prepubertal rats and support the possible use of GnRH agonists as oestrus cycle suppressors to turn adult rats into gonadal quiescence.",Excluded,0.93804634

334,"Immediate mechanical reactions of isolated human detrusor muscle on x-irradiation The mechanical activity (isotonic registration) of isolated detrusor (smooth) muscle preparations from the human urinary bladder (surgical material) is investigated. The preparations reacted on X-irradiation (50 kV) with an immediate dose-dependent tonic contraction at threshold-doses of 100 to 1000 R (1 to 3 kR/min). The contraction was either reversible, semireversible or persistent, and the basal muscle tone was elevated. A tachyphylactic reaction was observed. The phasic activity of the preparations was temporarily increased, then inhibited after irradiation. The radiation-induced changes of the human and guinea-pig detrusor muscle are compared and their possible relation to the functional disturbances of the urinary bladder after radiotherapy is discussed.",Excluded,0.9378588
116,"Dose Estimation Curves Following In Vitro X-ray Irradiation Using Blood From Four Healthy Korean Individuals Cytogenetic dosimetry is useful for evaluating the absorbed dose of ionizing radiation based on analysis of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations. We created two types of in vitro dose-response calibration curves for dicentric chromosomes (DC) and translocations (TR) induced by X-ray irradiation, using an electron linear accelerator, which is the most frequently used medical device in radiotherapy. We irradiated samples from four healthy Korean individuals and compared the resultant curves between individuals. Aberration yields were studied in a total of 31,800 and 31,725 metaphases for DC and TR, respectively, obtained from 11 X-ray irradiation dose-points (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Gy). The dose-response relationship followed a linear-quadratic equation, Y=C+alphaD+betaD2, with the coefficients C=0.0011 for DC and 0.0015 for TR, alpha=0.0119 for DC and 0.0048 for TR, and beta=0.0617 for DC and 0.0237 for TR. Correlation coefficients between irradiation doses and chromosomal aberrations were 0.971 for DC and 0.6 for TR, indicating a very strong and a moderate correlation, respectively. This is the first study implementing cytogenetic dosimetry following exposure to ionizing X-radiation. Copyright © The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine.",Excluded,0.9378361
133,"[Adaptive response of blood lymphocytes as a marker of hemopoiesis status in exposed persons] An obvious correlation between the type of reaction manifested by peripheral blood lymphocytes to low dose irradiation in vitro (adaptive potential), the RBM cell composition (during the period of the major exposure), and the peripheral blood cell composition (at a late time period coincident with the studies of induced radioresistance) has been found in the Techa riverside residents in the later periods after the onset of a long-term low-dose rate radiation exposure (55-60 years later) within a range of individual red bone marrow doses from 0.01 to 1.79 Gy. The nature of these dependences observed in chronically exposed individuals differs from that revealed in the controls. It can be suggested based on the results of the study that the capacity for the adaptive response shown by peripheral blood lymphocytes donated by exposed persons in the remote period after exposure can be regarded as a biological marker of the functional state of the hemopoietic stem cell pool.",Excluded,0.93777853
351,"Radiation dose response estimation with emphasis on low dose range using restricted cubic splines: application to all solid cancer mortality data, 1950-2003, in atomic bomb survivors Using the all solid cancer mortality data set of the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort from 1950 to 2003 (LSS Report 14) data among atomic bomb survivors, excess relative risk (ERR) statistical analyses were performed using the second degree polynomial and the threshold and restricted cubic spline (RCS) dose response models. For the RCS models with 3 to 7 knots of equally spaced percentiles with margins in the dose range greater than 50 mGy, the dose response was assumed to be linear at less than 70 to 90 mGy. Due to the skewed dose distribution of atomic bomb survivors, the current knot system for the RCS analysis results in a detailed depiction of the dose response as less than approximately 0.5 Gy. The 6 knot RCS models for the all-solid cancer mortality dose response of the whole dose or less than 2 Gy were selected with the AIC model selection criterion and fit significantly better (p < 0.05) than the linear (L) model. The usual RCS includes the L-global model but not the quadratic (Q) nor linear-quadratic (LQ) global models. The authors extended the RCS to include L or LQ global models by putting L or LQ constraints on the cubic spline in the lower and upper tails, and the best RCS model selected with AIC criterion was the usual RCS with L-constraints in both the lower and upper tails. The selected RCS had a linear dose-response model in the lower dose range (i.e., < 0.2-0.3 Gy) and was compatible with the linear no-threshold (LNT) model in this dose range. The proposed method is also useful in describing the dose response of a specific cancer or non-cancer disease incidence/mortality.",Excluded,0.937778
177,"Effect of irradiation, asbestos and chemical cocarcinogens on incidence of sarcoma on implants An implant can act as a physical carcinogen. Chemicals applied to its surface can augment that. To explore if cocarcinogenesis would affect the incidence of tumour on implants, we tested several physical (asbestos, beta irradiation) and chemical (acridine orange, phorbol methyl ester, cigarette smoke tar, extract of Agaricus bisporus mushroom) carcinogens on 25 mm diameter nitrocellulose filters implanted in groups of BALB/c mice in 9 experiments. Saline was applied in 287 concurrent controls. Irradiation by 540 kBq I-125 fibrinogen on foreign bodies of surface area 20sq cm induced tumour in 6/6 pilot animals (expected 2/6) and in 25/36 animals (controls 13/29; p < 0.04). The mean dose (beta and gamma) to cells within 20 mum of the filter surface was estimated to be 782 mGy. Exposures to 270kBq or less were not significantly cocarcinogenic with single implants. Radiation from the paired implants was detectible up to 80 weeks. Asbestos, however, 2.3 or 4.6 mgm on implants did not in 3 trials increase sarcoma yield significantly, but did induce mesothelial-type growths in the peritoneum. Asbestos (2.3 mg) injected without an implant provoked no tumour at the site. The chemical carcinogen acridine orange gave ambiguous results, and the others reduced tumour incidence insignificantly. The irradiation history may be germane in the human cases that arise.",Excluded,0.9377321

Postirradiation use of hyperbaric oxygen treatment at 2.8 ATA (2-hour daily treatments for 21 days) increased the biomechanical force necessary to unscrew the titanium implants by 44% in irradiated bone and by 22% in nonirradiated bone.,Excluded,0.93772674
31,"Chromosome aberrations induced by tritiated water or 60Co gamma-rays at early pronuclear stage in mouse eggs The induction of chromosome aberrations in mouse eggs by exposure to HTO beta-particles and 60Co gamma-rays at the early pronuclear stage was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase by using an in vitro fertilization technique. Eggs at the pronuclear stage were exposed to beta-particles in a chemically defined medium containing tritiated water (HTO) for 2 h at 3-5 h after insemination. Other eggs at the same stage were exposed to gamma-rays from 60Co during the same period. The dose-response relationships for frequencies of chromosome aberrations per egg were fitted to a linear-quadratic model for HTO beta-particles, and to a linear model for 60Co gamma-rays. The chromosome aberrations were mainly chromosome-type, and the majority of all aberrations were fragments. RBE values of HTO beta-particles relative to 60Co gamma-rays and acute X-rays, which were estimated from the ratio of the linear regression coefficients over 0.05-Gy range, were 2.0 and 1.6, respectively.",Excluded,0.9377005

1123,"Correlation between normal tissue complications and in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts derived from radiotherapy patients treated for variety of tumors PURPOSE: To assess the relationship between fibroblast intrinsic radiosensitivity in vitro and late reactions of normal tissues in patients treated by definitive radiotherapy for variety of tumors., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients were selected for this study. They were treated by radical radiotherapy for variety of tumors, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate, glottic larynx, anal canal, cervix, bladder, thyroid gland, and tonsil pillar. Five patients did not develop any significant late reactions (normally sensitive group, NS). The other five developed late complications in different normal tissues and organs that proved to be fatal in one patient (clinically hyper-sensitive group, HS). Fibroblast cultures were established from punch skin biopsy and radiosensitivity in vitro was measured. The survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) was calculated and compared between the two groups., RESULTS: SF2 ranged between 0.10 and 0.38 with a mean of 0.24. The mean SF2 for each of the NS and the HS groups were 0.31 and 0.17, respectively. The non-parametric rank test of Mann-Whitney shows that the difference between the two groups is statistically significant (p = 0.01)., CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts is correlated with late complications in different organs and normal tissues following radiotherapy for variety of tumors. It also lends support to the existence of a common genetic component determining the radiosensitivity of cells targeted by the late effects of ionizing radiation.",Excluded,0.93760914
350,"Translocation analysis by the FISH-painting method for retrospective dose reconstruction in individuals exposed to ionizing radiation 10 years after exposure Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful method largely used for detecting chromosomal rearrangements, translocations in particular, which are important biomarkers for dose assessment in case of human exposure to ionizing radiation. To test the possibility of using the translocation analysis by FISH-painting method in retrospective dose assessment, we carried out in vitro experiments in irradiated human lymphocytes, in parallel with the analysis of translocations in lymphocytes from 10 individuals, who were exposed to 137cesium in the Goiania (Brazil) accident (samples collected 10 years after exposure). The in vitro dose-response curve for the genomic translocation frequencies (FGs) fits a linear quadratic model, according to the equation: Y=0.0243X2+0.0556X. The FG values were also calculated for the individuals exposed to 137cesium, ranging from 0.58 to 5.91 per 100 cells, and the doses were estimated and compared with the results obtained by dicentric analysis soon after the accident, taking the opportunity to test the validity of translocation analysis in retrospective biodosimetry. A tentative of retrospective dosimetry was performed, indicating that the method is feasible only for low level exposure (below 0.5Gy), while for higher doses there is a need to apply appropriate correction factors, which take into consideration mainly the persistence of chromosomal translocations along with time, and the influence of endogenous and exogenous factors determining the inter-individual variability in the cellular responses to radiation. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

143,"Telomere stability correlates with longevity of human beings exposed to ionizing radiations Normal somatic cells have a finite number of divisions, a limited capacity to proliferate. Human telomeres contain TTAGGG repeats which are considered a molecular clock marker. The gradual and progressive telomere shortening at each replicative cycle is associated, through the activation of pRB and p53 pathways and genomic instability, to the replicative senescence, a non-dividing state and widespread cell death. There is no information available about telomere status in individuals who live long and have been exposed to ionizing radiations (IR). To determine the telomere stability, we examined telomeres at metaphase, G2-type chromosome aberrations after IR treatment and karyotypic analysis of 15 individuals. Three individuals were above the age of 80 years and 1 among the 3 was estimated to have received more than 10 Gy of occupational exposure about 30 years back. The other 12 were cancer patients that had received more than 50 Gy of gamma-radiation for therapeutic purposes. No telomere instability or defective G2 chromosome repair was found in 3 individuals above the age of 80 years. Whereas, 3 out of 7 prostate and 1 out of 5 breast cancer patients showed higher G2-type chromosome damage as well as a high frequency of telomeric association (also known as chromosome end associations) along with frequent loss of telomeres. Present studies demonstrate that telomere stability along with normal G2 chromosome repair correlates with the longevity of human beings, whereas defective G2 chromosome repair and telomere instability correlate with the radiotherapy related late toxicity.",Excluded,0.93757254

There was revealed a linear dependence of the number of the 8-9-day colonies grown in the bone marrow of the femur on the amount of the administered cells, and an exponential dependence on the irradiation dose. Regularity of the stem cell cloning in the bone marrow was analogous to such in the spleen. Radiosensitivity of the colony-forming units (CFU) differed depending on the site (the spleen, the bone marrow) of their colony formation. The CFU settling in the marrow proved to be more radioresistant (D(0) equalled 160-200 P) in comparison with the CFU settling in the spleen (D(0) constituted 80-100 P). It is supposed that a different radiosensitivity of the CFU was caused by the presence of heterogenic population of the stem cells and also by specific peculiarities of the organ (the spleen, the bone marrow) in which the colonies formed.",Excluded,0.937493
828,"Gamma-H2AX-based dose estimation for whole and partial body radiation exposure Most human exposures to ionising radiation are partial body exposures. However, to date only limited tools are available for rapid and accurate estimation of the dose distribution and the extent of the body spared from the exposure. These parameters are of great importance for emergency triage and clinical management of exposed individuals. Here, measurements of gamma-H2AX immunofluorescence by microscopy and flow cytometry were compared as rapid biodosimetric tools for whole and partial body exposures. Ex vivo uniformly X-irradiated blood lymphocytes from one donor were used to generate a universal biexponential calibration function for gamma-H2AX foci/intensity yields per unit dose for time points up to 96 hours post exposure. Foci--but not intensity--levels remained significantly above background for 96 hours for doses of 0.5 Gy or more. Foci-based dose estimates for ex vivo X-irradiated blood samples from 13 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered to the targeted samples. Flow cytometric dose estimates for X-irradiated blood samples from 8 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered at 1 hour post exposure but less so at 24 hours post exposure. In partial body exposures, simulated by mixing ex vivo irradiated and unirradiated lymphocytes, foci/intensity distributions were significantly over-dispersed compared to uniformly irradiated lymphocytes. For both methods and in all cases the estimated fraction of irradiated lymphocytes and dose to that fraction, calculated using the zero contaminated Poisson test and gamma-H2AX calibration function, were in good agreement with the actual mixing ratios and doses delivered to the samples. In conclusion, gamma-H2AX analysis of irradiated lymphocytes enables rapid and accurate assessment of whole body doses while dispersion analysis of foci or intensity distributions helps determine partial body doses and the irradiated fraction size in cases of partial body exposures.",Excluded,0.93746233

1213,"Chronic bronchitis in the cohort of Mayak workers first employed 1948-1958 Incidence of chronic bronchitis has been studied in a cohort of 12,210 workers first employed at one of the main plants of the Mayak nuclear facility during 1948-1958 and followed up to 31 December 2005. Information on external gamma doses is available for virtually all of these workers; in contrast, plutonium body burden was measured only for 30% of workers. During the follow-up period in the study cohort 1,175 incident cases of chronic bronchitis were verified. The analyses of nonradiation factors revealed that the underlying risk of chronic bronchitis incidence increased with increasing attained age and was higher among smokers compared with never-smokers as would be expected. The most interesting finding in relationship to nonradiation factors was a sharp increase in the baseline chronic bronchitis risk before 1960. The cause of this is not clear but a number of factors may play a role. Based on the follow-up data after 1960, the analysis showed a statistically significant linear dose response relationship with cumulative external gamma-ray dose (ERR/Gy = 0.14, 95% CI 0.01, 0.32). Based on the same subset but with an additional restriction to members with cumulative internal lung dose below 1 Gy, a statistically significant linear dose response relationship with internal alpha-radiation lung dose from incorporated plutonium was found (ERR/Gy = 2.70, 95% CI 1.20, 4.87). In both cases, adjustment was made for nonradiation factors, including smoking and either internal or external dose as appropriate. At present there are no similar incidence studies with which to compare results. However, the most recent data from the atomic bomb survivor cohort (the Life Span Study) showed statistically significant excess mortality risk for respiratory diseases of 22% per Gy and this value is within the confidence bounds of the point estimate of the risk from this study in relation to external dose.",Excluded,0.93740994

A dose of 3000 rads of betatron X-rays produced a mutation rate of 4.36 X 10(-8) per rad/locus. Among the mutations observed, 66% were recessive lethals and 34% viable when homozygous. Only one of the 24 viable mutations was associated with a chromosome aberration. Among the 47 recessive lethals, no two-break aberrations were detected in 48.9% of the lethals, deletions were associated with 42.2%, inversions with 6.7% and translocations with 2.2%.-When these genetic results are compared to those for 250 KV X-rays, the mutation rate for betatron treatments was slightly lower (.76), the recessive lethal rate among induced mutations was higher, and the chromosome aberrations among lethal mutations were slightly lower than with 250 KV X-rays.

432,"DNA alterations detected in the progeny of paternally irradiated Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) A nonmammalian test system for germ-cell mutagenesis has been developed by using the Japanese medaka fish. We describe a system for detecting DNA alterations in F1 progeny descended from the gamma-irradiated male medaka that uses an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction and fingerprinting. A combination of these two methods has some advantages for screening changes in genomic DNA of individual progeny because this detection system can (i) screen for mutational events before embryos with dominant lethal mutations are eliminated during development and (ii) detect DNA changes in the progeny of irradiated males without functional selection and bias, such as resistance to chemicals. DNA alterations are detected as changes in patterns (i.e., band loss and/or band gain) of DNA fingerprints of progeny descended from males whose spermatozoa or spermatids were gamma-irradiated (4.75 or 9.50 Gy). We determined the frequency of gamma-irradiation-induced band loss in arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction fingerprints of DNA from severely malformed embryos with dominant lethal mutations and hatched viable embryos. The frequency of band loss in both dominant lethal embryos and hatched viable embryos increased with increasing gamma-ray dose, although more so in the former. We detected a new band in the fingerprints as a heritable DNA alteration but not a viability- or phenotype-affecting DNA alteration in two viable mutants recovered after gamma-irradiation experiments.

431,"Studies on mutagen-sensitive strains of Drosophila melanogaster, VIII. Further data on differences between Canton-S and ebony strains with respect to maternal effects for the X-ray induction of autosomal translocations and ring-X chromosome losses in mature spermatozoa The influence of the maternal genotype (Canton-S, proficient in the repair of X-ray-induced chromosome breaks and ebony, less proficient in this regard) on the recovery of X-ray-induced autosomal (II-III) translocations and ring-X chromosome losses in mature spermatozoa was studied. In the first series of experiments, males carrying appropriate markers on their second and third chromosomes were irradiated and mated to Canton-S or ebony females and the frequencies of II-III translocations were determined. In the second series of experiments, males carrying ring-X chromosomes were irradiated in N2 or in O2, mated to Canton-S or ebony females and the frequencies of XO males were determined; additionally, under similar gas-treatment and radiation conditions, the pattern of egg-mortality was also assessed. The data on translocations show that the yields are higher with ebony than with Canton-S females; these and earlier results on dominant lethals and sex-linked recessive lethals support the interpretation that the maternal repair system in the ebony strain is less proficient and more error-prone than that of the Canton-S strain. Those on the losses of ring-X chromosomes demonstrate that (i) the absolute yields of XO males are lower with ebony than with Canton-S females irrespective of whether the parental males are irradiated in N2 or in O2; (ii) the exposure-frequency relationships are all linear, but the slopes are higher when the males are irradiated in O2 and are consistent with an oxygen-enhancement-ratio of about 1.5 and (iii) the relationships between the logarithm of egg-survival and XO male frequency are also linear, but the slopes for the O2 groups are lower than those for the N2 groups (slope ratios of 0.86-0.87). The finding that at given survival levels, the XO frequencies are lower in the O2 than in the N2 groups of both the Canton-S and ebony series viewed in the context of the mechanisms that have been postulated to explain the loss of ring-X chromosomes in irradiated mature spermatozoa permits the following interpretation for the observed results: (i) a higher proportion of potential XO zygotes is lost through dominant lethality in the O2 groups than in the N2 ones presumably because the chromosome breaks induced in O2 are qualitatively different in the sense that they have a higher probability to undergo reunions relative to restitution, compared with breaks induced under anoxia and (ii) this leads to lower than expected oxygen-enhancement ratios (i.e., expected on the basis of published data on sex-linked recessive lethals, another kind of genetic damage which shows a linear exposure-frequency relationship.",Excluded,0.93713874

The rate of recovery in tumours (t1/2 = 0.31 +/- 0.15 h for local control) was significantly faster than in skin (t1/2 = 0.96 +/- 0.10 h). By contrast, the fractionation sensitivity of CaNT tumours was less than that of skin (alpha/beta = 43.3 +/- 8.5 Gy vs. alpha/beta = 7.9 +/- 0.2 Gy). Tissues with recovery half-times similar to or longer than that determined for skin would be at risk if interfraction intervals less than 6 h are used in regimes which involve the use of two or more fractions per day.

802,"Sex-specific differences in fetal germ cell apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that male human fetal germ cells are highly radiosensitive and that their death depends on p53 activation. Male germ cell apoptosis was initiated with doses as low as 0.1 Gy and was prevented by pifithrin alpha, a p53 inhibitor. In this study, we investigated the radiosensitivity of early female and male fetal proliferating germ cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Both male and female fetal germ cells displayed a similar number of gamma H2AX foci in response to ionizing radiation (IR). In organ culture of human fetal ovaries, the germ cells underwent apoptosis only when exposed to high doses of IR (1.5 Gy and above). Accumulation of p53 was detected in irradiated male human fetal germ cells but not in female ones. Inhibition of p53 with pifithrin alpha did not affect oogonia apoptosis following irradiation. IR induced apoptosis similarly in mouse fetal ovaries in organ culture and in vivo during oogonial proliferation. Germ cell survival in testes from p53 knockout or p63 knockout mice exposed to IR was better than wild-type, whereas female germ cell survival was unaffected by p53 or p63 knockout.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that pre-meiotic male and female fetal germ cells behave differently in response to a genotoxic stress--irradiation--with oogonia being less sensitive and undergoing p53-independent apoptosis.",Excluded,0.93709505
225,"Changes in X-ray sensitivity of mouse eggs from fertilization to the early pronuclear stage, and their repair capacity To study the changes in radiosensitivity of male and female genomes from fertilization to the pronuclear stage, the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase in eggs fertilized with X-irradiated sperm, in eggs X-irradiated at the mature oocyte stage immediately before fertilization, and in fertilized eggs exposed to X-rays at various stages before DNA synthesis (1-5 h after insemination). Gametic treatment, fertilization and embryo culture were carried out in vitro. Most of the induced chromosome aberrations were chromosome-type aberrations, the frequency of chromosome fragments being the highest, followed by chromosome exchanges in both sperm and oocytes. The induction of chromosome-type aberrations was much higher in oocytes than in sperm. Chromosome-type aberrations were the main type also in fertilized eggs irradiated at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. The radiosensitivity increased gradually with pronuclear formation (1-4h after insemination), but little difference in radiosensitivity was observed between eggs irradiated at 4 h and 5 h, corresponding to the stage when pronuclear formation was complete. The drastic change with pronuclear formation was found not only in radiosensitivity but also in the frequency of chromosome aberrations. The frequency of chromosome-type exchanges decreased drastically 2 h after insemination, and exchanges were barely observed at 5 h. The difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes also markedly changed with pronuclear formation, the chromosome aberration induction in the female genome being much higher than that in the male genome before accomplishment of pronuclear formation. The analysis of potentiation effects of 3-aminobenzamide and caffeine on the yield of X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations demonstrated that the increase of radiosensitivity and the decrease of chromosome-type exchange induction with pronuclear formation, may be closely correlated with alterations in chromatin configuration in the pronuclei and in repair capacity of fertilized eggs at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. No evidence based on repair efficiency was found for the marked difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes during pronuclear formation.",Excluded,0.9370874
170,"The genome-wide effects of ionizing radiation on mutation induction in the mammalian germline The ability to predict the genetic consequences of human exposure to ionizing radiation has been a long-standing goal of human genetics in the past 50 years. Here we present the results of an unbiased, comprehensive genome-wide survey of the range of germline mutations induced in laboratory mice after parental exposure to ionizing radiation and show irradiation markedly alters the frequency and spectrum of de novo mutations. Here we show that the frequency of de novo copy number variants (CNVs) and insertion/deletion events (indels) is significantly elevated in offspring of exposed fathers. We also show that the spectrum of induced de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) is strikingly different; with clustered mutations being significantly over-represented in the offspring of irradiated males.

1232,"Biodosimetry for high dose accidental exposures by drug induced premature chromosome condensation (PCC) assay The conventional dicentric assay does not provide an accurate dose estimate in the case of accidental exposure to ionizing radiation above 6 Gy due to mitotic delay and poor mitotic index. The present study aims to establish a simple and rapid dose assessment technique based on scoring of rings and fragments in PCC spreads of stimulated lymphocytes. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were gamma irradiated to different doses (6.2-24.5 Gy), cultured for two days with PHA and were forced to condense prematurely using 500 nM Okadaic acid (OA). The chromosome spreads were prepared, stained with Giemsa and observed under a microscope. The PCC index, PCC rings, and PCC fragments were scored for each dose point to arrive at the dose effect curve for various end points such as induction of rings and fragments and dicentrics. The PCC index varied from 12-18% up to 18 Gy and thereafter dropped to 6-8% at higher doses. The dose dependent increase in rings and fragments was found to be linear with a slope of 0.054+/-0.001 Gy(-1) for rings and 0.45+/-0.03 Gy(-1) for PCC fragments. An experiment was carried out to simulate partial-body exposure by mixing 10 Gy in vitro irradiated blood with un-irradiated blood in different proportions. The ratio of frequency of damaged cells among the total number of cells analyzed was found to be a good index of partial-body exposure. The culture duration was extended to 72 h to overcome the cell cycle delay induced by high doses of radiation. The conventional dicentrics rings and fragments also showed a dose response at high doses. The response can be best fitted to a linear model with a slope of 0.28+/-0.0007 Gy(-1) for the induction of dicentrics. However, long culture duration, technical skill and time required to analyse multi-aberrant cells makes the dicentric assay less suitable for high dose exposures requiring a rapid dose estimate. The PCC assay can be performed in 50 h with biodosimetric information about the irradiated fraction in cases of acute radiation exposures. The automated finding of PCC spreads significantly increased the speed of scoring PCC fragments. Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.93707854

Also, sex ratios of adults treated as protonymphs were recorded as were sex ratios of embryos and F1 adults produced by these adults. Doses up to 1.0 krad did not prevent development of treated protonymphs to the adult stage or stop mating. Three krad reduced the number of treated protonymphs attaining adulthood and 6.0-krad treatment prevented all mites from developing to the adult stage. Egg (embryo) production was normal for mites treated with 0.50 krad, but significantly curtailed by doses of 0.75 krad and greater.

Like the results obtained with preimplantation stages, we observed a statistically significant increase in the number of malformed fetuses (exclusively gastroschises) on day 19 of gestation, when oocytes within 1-4 weeks before ovulation were exposed to 2 or 3 Gy. Less mature oocytes were killed by radiation doses of 0.5 Gy and higher. In addition to the increased frequency of malformations, we found a dose-dependent increase of lethal effects (affecting either oocytes or specific gestational stages) and of runts ('dwarfs').",Excluded,0.9369542

884,"Chromosome anomalies in mouse oocytes after irradiation We investigated the cytogenetic effects of X-rays on unfertilized mouse oocytes. NMRI females received an irradiation with 0,22.2,66.6,200, and 600 R during the preovulatory phase 3 hrs after HCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin). This is a stage during oogenesis in which the oocytes pass from late dictyotene to diakinesis. Chromosome analysis was performed after ovulation at metaphase II. From these experiments we can draw the following conclusions: 1) X-rays induced during the preovulatory phase a high number of chromosome anomalies. Among these, structural anomalies prevail. 7 out of 144 ovulated oocytes in matched controls carried such an abnormality, whereas after irradiation we observed with 22.2, 66.6, 200, and 600 R, 11 out of 72, 34 out of 108, 89 out of 102, and 122 out of 124, respectively. 2) Irradiation seems also to affect the chromosome segregation during the 1. meiotic division, as we observed after 22.2, 66.6, and 200 R a total of 6 oocytes out of 204 with a supernummary chromosome. In controls, however, no hyperploidy was found in 143 ova. This increase, however, was not significant. 3) Chromosome anomalies, e.g. breaks and deletions that go back to a one-break event increased linearly with increasing dose. Exchanges, however, going back to two-break events fittest best to the linear-quadratic dose-response model. 4) The dose of 600 R seems to represents a kind of borderline in this experiment, because nearly all (122 out 124) carried at least one structural chromosome anomaly. It is also this dose after which the highest frequency of reciprocal translocations was observed in a hump-shaped slope in spermatocytes after irradiation of spermatogonia (Preston and Brewen, 1973). With an increasing dosage up to 1200 R the frequency of translocations decrease again. The elimination of cells, crossing this borderline, might be due to genetic or non-genetic effects. 5) The frequency of radiation-induced translocations per oocyte agrees with the frequency of translocations in human lymphocytes (Dolphin and Lloyd, 1974) after in vitro irradiation. 6) Significant, lower frequencies of structural chromosome anomalies were observed irradiating earlier stages of mouse oogenesis. These stages are dictyotene from females at the age of 3, or 6 weeks and prophase I-stages in female embryos on the 17th day of gestation. This result may be due to a lower sensitivity of these stages or to modifying events during the interval between irradiation and preparations.",Excluded,0.93687665

Full grown pupae of the wax moth, Galleria mellonella were irradiated with 80 and 160 Gy of gamma irradiation. The size of the testes was decreased by increasing of gamma irradiation dose. Also, the size of the testes was decreased in F 1 males comparing with the size of the testes of both the parents and the untreated control. The effects of gamma rays on the DNA patterns of adult male parents and F 1 males showed alterations among the controls, the treated parents and F 1 individuals.

200,"X-ray induced sex-chromosome loss, when ring-X chromosome males are irradiated and mated to females carrying mei-9, mei-41 or mei-218 Radiation damage induced in the sperm nucleus is repaired after this nucleus has entered the oocyte. The yield of induced genetic damage is known to be dependent on maternal genotype and can also be modified by treatment of the females with metabolic inhibitors. The experiments reported here were designed to find out whether a more specific analysis of the interaction between male gamete and oocyte cytoplasm can be carried out using mutants that are known to affect repair processes. Males carrying ring-X chromosomes were exposed to X-ray doses up to 1000 R and mated to females homozygous for a repair-deficient mutant. The mutants used were mei-9a, mei-9L1, mei-41A10, and mei-41D5. In addition a yellow (y) X chromosome was used as a control and an attempt was made to obtain data using mei-21815, a mutant at a locus not thought to affect repair. With mei-9 mutants there is an enhancement of the spontaneous and induced rates of paternal sex-chromosome loss. The mei-41 mutants did not affect the rates of paternal sex-chromosome loss. Mei-218 females were difficult to work with because they gave very few progeny.

1122,"In vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts can identify a group of radiotherapy patients having developed complications in a variety of normal tissues Purpose. - A retrospective study of the in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts derived from two groups of patients treated by definitive radiotherapy for a variety of tumors who either displayed or did not display severe complications. Patients and methods. - Seven radiotherapy patients were selected: three were treated for head and neck, prostate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma tumors, and did not develop any significant complications (control group); four patients were treated for bladder, thyroid, head and neck and anal canal tumors and developed serious acute and especially late reactions (hypersensitive group). Primary cell cultures of skin fibroblasts were established and their radiosensitivity studied by the clonogenic assay after exposing to single radiation doses ranging between 1 and 8 Gy. Results. - The survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) ranged from 0.27 to 0.38, with a mean of 0.33 for the control group, and from 0.10 to 0.20 with a mean of 0.17 for the hypersensitive group. The Mann-Whitney non-parametric test showed that the difference between the two means was statistically significant (p = 0.03). Conclusion. - The data are in favor of a correlation between the radiosensitivity of patients' fibroblasts and the reactions of different normal tissues to radiotherapy. This association supports the use of the clonogenic survival, or a surrogate test, as a predictive assay. The multiplicity of normal tissues and organs implicated in this association suggests the existence of genetic factors that determine, at least in part, the radiosensitivity of target cells involved in the expression of normal tissues complications following radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.9367729
1140,"Irradiated laboratory animal diets: dominant lethal studies in the mouse In 4 separate dominant lethal experiments groups of mice of either Charles River CD1 or Alderley Park strains were fed laboratory diets (Oakes, 41B, PRD, BP nutrition rat and mouse maintenance diet No. 1). The diets were either untreated (negative control diets) or irradiated at 1, 2.5 and 5 megarad and were freshly irradiated, or stored. The animals were fed their test diets for a period of 3 weeks prior to mating. Groups of mice given a single intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg cyclophosphamide per kg body weight served as the positive controls. Freshly irradiated PRD diet fed to male mice of both strains caused an increase in early deaths in females mated to the males in week 7 and to a lesser extent in week 4. The increase due to irradiation was small by comparison with that produced by the positive control compound. The responses for the other irradiated diets showed no significant increases in early deaths although some values for Oakes diet were high. The effect of storage was examined with PRD and BPN diet on one occasion and produced conflicting results. Thus there was some evidence that irradiated PRD diet has weak mutagenic activity in the meiotic and/or pre-meiotic phase of the spermatogenic cycle which appeared to be lessened on storage; the inclusion of such a diet in toxicological studies would therefore need to be carefully considered.",Excluded,0.9366436
846,"31P NMR spectroscopy can predict the optimum interval between fractionated irradiation doses This study was performed to clarify whether changes in the metabolites observed by phosphorous-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) could indicate an optimum interval between two doses of radiation in a murine tumor model. Murine mammary carcinoma cells, FM3A, were irradiated 7 days after transplantation with a single 5 Gy dose without anesthesia. 31P spectra were measured with a spectrometer up to 30 days. The beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi values were calculated from the peak area of each spectrum. In a fractionation experiment, two fractions of irradiation at a 5 Gy per fraction were given at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 6 day intervals. Tumor growth delay was also scored to determine the fractionated radiation effect. In the control group, beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi decreased with tumor growth. In the single irradiation group, the tumor did not grow up to day 6, and an initial rise and subsequent decrease in beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed. Maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed on day 2 after irradiation. In a fractionation experiment, the greatest growth delay was observed in the two day interval group, in which maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were demonstrated in 31P-MRS.

The experimental group showed significant reduction in GSI (0.47 +/- 0.01) & ESI (1.22 +/- 0.08) after exposure to 60Co gamma radiation. Egg Count (3713 +/- 21) and Egg hatching rates (3798 +/- 11) were significantly reduced in all irradiated groups. The number of dead larva increased with the increasing level of doses. With the increase in dosage level, the gonad and egg clutch weight were decreased which likely lead to reduced number of eggs.

51,"Effects of different gamma exposure regimes on reproduction in the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Oligochaeta) Ecological risk assessment of ionising radiation requires knowledge about the responses of individuals and populations to chronic exposures, including situations when exposure levels change over time. The present study investigated processes such as recovery and the adaptive response with respect to reproduction endpoints in the earthworm Eisenia fetida exposed to (60)Co gamma-radiation. Furthermore, a crossed experiment was performed to investigate the influence of F0 parental and F1 embryonic irradiation history on the response of irradiated or non-irradiated F1 offspring. Recovery: The sterility induced by sub-chronic exposure at 17 m Gy/h (accumulated dose: 25 Gy) was temporary, and 8 weeks after irradiation the worms had regained their reproductive capacity (number of viable offspring produced per adult per week). Adaptive response: Adult worms were continuously exposed at a low priming dose rate of 0.14 mGy/h for 12 weeks (accumulated dose: 0.24 Gy), followed by 14 weeks exposure at a challenge dose rate of 11 mGy/h. The results suggest a lack of adaptive response, since there were no significant differences in the effects on reproduction capacity between the primed and the unprimed groups after challenge doses ranging from 7.6 to 27 Gy. Crossed experiment: The effects of exposure at 11 mGy/h for 21 weeks on growth, sexual maturation and reproduction of offspring, derived either from parent worms and cocoons both exposed at 11 mGy/h, or from non-irradiated parents and cocoons (total accumulated dose 44 and 38 Gy, respectively) were compared. There were no significant differences between the two exposed offspring groups for any of the endpoints. The reproduction capacity was very low for both groups compared to the controls, but the reproduction seemed to be maintained at the reduced level, which could indicate acclimatisation or stabilisation. Finally, parental and embryonic exposures at 11 mGy/h did not affect reproduction in the F1 offspring as adults. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.93660486

By a conservative estimate, about three per cent of the pre-1987 cancer deaths of Hanford workers had occupational exposures to external radiation as the critical (induction) event. These radiogenic cancers were evenly distributed between five diagnostic groups, but as a result of there being much greater sensitivity to cancer induction by radiation"" after, rather than before, 50 years of age, they were concentrated among the cancers which proved fatal after 70 years of age. The reanalysis provides no support for the idea that radiation is more likely to cause leukemia than solid tumors, or the idea that there is reduced cancer effectiveness of radiation at low dose levels (dose rate effectiveness factor or DREF hypothesis), but the estimated proportion of radiogenic cancers was much higher for the 175 nonfatal cancers (which had other certified causes of death) than for the 1,732 fatal cases. Finally, according to the latest publication of the US Committee on Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR V), dose rate is more important than exposure age, and even a single exposure to 10 rem would only increase the normal cancer risk by four percent. Nevertheless, for all recorded exposures of Hanford workers, the estimated doubling dose was close to 26 rem; for exposures after 58 years, it was close to 5 rem, and for exposures after 62 years, it was less than 1 rem.""",Excluded,0.93659127

We show that cytotoxicity dose-response relationships for bone marrow cells and splenocytes are complex, involving negative curvature (decreasing slope as dose increases), presumably implicating a mixed cell population comprised of large numbers of hypersensitive, modestly radiosensitive, and resistant cells. The radiosensitive cells appear to respond with 50% being killed by a dose < 0.5 Gy. The X-ray relative biological effectiveness (RBE), relative to gamma rays, for destroying bone marrow cells in vivo is > 1, while for destroying splenocytes it is < 1. In contrast, dose-response relationships for reconstitution deficits in the bone marrow and spleen of C.B-17 mice at 6 weeks after radiation exposure were of the threshold type with gamma rays being more effective in causing reconstitution deficit. © 2013 University of Massachusetts.",Excluded,0.9365588
174,"Profiles of non-cancer diseases in atomic bomb survivors This article summarizes the results of a recent study of atomic bomb radiation and non-cancer diseases in the AHS (Adult Health Study) population by the RERF (Radiation Effects Research Foundation) along with a general discussion of previous studies. The association of atomic bomb radiation and CVD was examined by incidence studies and prevalence studies of various endpoints of atherosclerosis, such as MI, stroke, aortic arch calcification, isolated systolic hypertension, and pulse wave velocity, and, although the excess was small, all endpoints indicated an increase of CVD in the heavily exposed group. Because of the consistency of the results, it is almost certain that CVD is higher among atomic bomb survivors. However, all CVD risk factors associated with lifestyle had not necessarily been adjusted for in studies to date, and it is difficult at present to conclude that the increase in CVD among survivors was a direct effect of radiation. Recent studies have demonstrated almost certainly that uterine myoma is more frequent among atomic bomb survivors. It cannot, at present, be concluded that uterine myoma is caused by radiation, because there are no reported studies of other exposed populations. Further analyses including the role of confounding factors as well as molecular approaches are needed to verify this radiation effect. The relationship between atomic bomb radiation exposure and hyperparathyroidism can now be said to have been established in view of the strong dose response, the agreement with results of studies of other populations, the high risk in the younger survivors, and the biological plausibility. Future studies by molecular approaches, etc., are needed to determine the pathogenic mechanism. Among other benign tumours, a dose response has been demonstrated for tumours of the thyroid, stomach and ovary. Although fewer studies have been conducted than for cancer, a clear association between radiation and various benign tumours is emerging. Concerning the association between atomic bomb radiation exposure and chronic liver diseases, the recent incidence study of members of the AHS population demonstrated a significant dose response. Both chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis were suggested as being associated with exposure. The possibility that the increased occurrence of chronic liver diseases among the survivors may be due to hepatitis virus infection cannot be excluded, and the results of the ongoing hepatitis C virus antibody titre studies are awaited.",Excluded,0.9364653

The aims of this study were to: 1) determine whether specific cytokine gene expression profiles can be delineated in individuals exposed to chronic, low-dose radiation; and 2) compare analyses from three multivariate analytic methodologies, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), and projection pursuit (PP), in evaluating transcriptional responses in human mononuclear cells to low doses of ionizing radiation (IR), as determined by cDNA microarrays., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total RNA isolated from mononuclear cells of 19 apparently healthy adult individuals exposed to low doses of IR ranging from 0.18 mSv to 49 mSv over a period of 11 to 13 years, as a result of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant catastrophe, was reverse transcribed in the presence of radioactive dATP to generate radiolabeled complementary cDNA. Target cDNA was hybridized to human cytokine and receptor arrays and mRNA transcriptional patterns were evaluated using HCA, PCA, and PP., RESULTS: Statistical analyses of the data generated from 19 microarrays revealed distinct gene expression patterns in mononuclear cells of individuals exposed to radiation doses of greater than 10 mSv or less than 10 mSv. Genes encompassed within clusters discerned by HCA, PCA, and PP varied depending on the methodology used to analyze the microarray data. The most frequently expressed genes across all radiation doses were serine/threonine protein kinase receptor (11/19), transforming growth factor (TGF) receptor (11/19), EB13 (10/19), and CD40 ligand., CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings suggest that it may be possible to assign gene expression profiles to low-dose-irradiated individuals, we show that gene expression profiles vary, depending on the statistical method used to analyze the data. Since there is, as of yet, no consensus regarding the best method to analyze a multivariate dataset, and since discarding the raw data and repeating the experiment at a later date constitutes an unwarranted expenditure, it is important to submit microarray data to public databases where these data can be reevaluated and interpreted by investigators holding expertise in various fields within the scientific community, including radiation biology, statistics, and bioinformatics.",Excluded,0.9362826

Following larval exposure One and seven days old larvae of the flesh fly, Parasarcophaga argyrostoma were exposed to doses ranging from 1-90 Gy. Lower doses ranging from 1-9 Gy applied to young larvae accelerate larval development whereas old larvae responded to doses from 10-90 Gy by a remarkable retardation of the larval and pupal development. Reduction in percentage pupation and adult emergence were noticed with increment in the radiation doses applied. This reduction was higher for irradiated seven days old larvae than the one day old larvae at all doses applied, indicating that young larvae were more susceptible to gamma radiation than the older one. At higher doses (30-70 Gy) the pupae could not continue their development and died within 17 days after pupation. The longevity of adults resulted from irradiated larvae was decreased by increasing the radiation dosage and it was found that adults emerging from irradiated young larvae lived shorter than those from irradiated young ones, the fecundity of adults resulted from irradiated larvae was also decreased by gamma irradiation exposures.

However, despite the benefits of medical radiation exposures, adverse long-term health effects are cause for concern. Protein and gene biomarkers are early indicators of cellular response after low-dose exposure. We examined DNA damage by quantifying gamma-H2AX foci and expression of twelve candidate genes in the blood lymphocytes of patients exposed to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional procedures. Entrance surface dose (ESD; 10.92-1062.55 mGy) was measured by thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD). Absorbed dose was estimated using gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression, with in vitro dose-response curves generated for the same biomarkers. gamma-H2AX foci in post-exposure samples were significantly higher than in pre-exposure samples. Among the genes analysed, FDXR, ATM, BCL2, MDM2, TNFSF9, and PCNA showed increased expression; CDKN1A, DDB2, SESN1, BAX, and TNFRSF10B showed unchanged or decreased expression. Absorbed dose, estimated based on gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression changes, did not show any correlation with measured ESD.

Incidence ratios were standardized to the general population and computed for different cancer sites., RESULTS: The cumulative risk for cancer at all sites (excluding brain tumors where the standardized incidence ratio [SIR] was 28) reached 86% 50 years after Thorotrast injection. SIR was greatly elevated at all sites except the brain and CNS (3.3, 95% confidence interval = 3.0-3.7), mainly because of liver cancers (SIR = 126) as well as leukemia (SIR = 10) for which a relationship was found between the time since injection and the estimated dose (but not the age at injection). Other sites with significantly increased risks of cancer included the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts (SIR = 14), peritoneum (SIR = 8.6), sites of multiple myeloma (SIR = 4.6), metastatic sites (SIR = 12), and unspecified sites (SIR = 11). Cancers of the lung and breast also occurred in significant excess, but no relationship between SIR and volume of injected Thorotrast or time since injection was observed.

The goals of this study were to determine the effect of hypoxia on the cell survival responses of different cell models (H460, DU145, A549, MDA231 and FADU) to modulated fields and to characterize the time dependency of signaling under oxic conditions, following reoxygenation and after prolonged hypoxia. Hypoxia was induced by incubating cells at 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide for 4 h prior to irradiation. The out-of-field response in MDA231 cells was oxygen dependent and therefore selected for co-culture studies to determine the signaling kinetics at different time intervals after irradiation under oxic and hypoxic conditions. Under both oxic and hypoxic conditions, significant increases in cell survival were observed in-field with significant decreases in survival observed out-of-field (P < 0.05), which were dependent on intercellular communication. The in-field response of MDA231 cells showed no significant time dependency up to 24 h postirradiation, while out-of-field survival decreased significantly during the first 6 h postirradiation (P < 0.05). While in-field responses were oxygen dependent, out-of-field effects were observed to be independent of oxygen, with similar or greater cell killing under hypoxic conditions.

Here, we performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to detect chromosomal copy number changes in a series of 16 rat osteosarcomas induced by injection of plutonium-238. Recurrent gains/amplifications were observed at chromosomal regions 3p12-q12, 3q41-qter, 4q41-qter, 6q12-q16, 7q22-q34, 8q11-q23, 9q11-q22, 10q32.1-qter, and 12q, whereas recurrent losses were observed at 1p, 1q, 3q23-q35, 5q21-q33, 8q24-q31, 10q22-q25, 15p, 15q, and 18q. The gained region at 7q22-q34 was homologous to human chromosome bands 12q13-q15/8q24/22q11-q13, including the loci of Mdm2, Cdk4, c-Myc and Pdgf-b genes. The lost regions at 5q21-q33, 10q22-q25 and 15q contained tumor suppressor genes such as p16INK4a/p19ARF, Tp53 and Rb1. To identify potential target gene(s) for the chromosomal aberrations, we compared the expression levels of several candidate genes, located within the regions of frequent chromosomal aberrations, between the tumors and normal osteoblasts by using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The Cdk4, c-Myc, Pdgf-b and p57KIP2 genes were thought to be possible target genes for the frequent chromosomal gain at 7q22-34 and loss at 1q in the tumors, respectively. In addition, mutations of the Tp53 gene were found in 27% (4 of 15) osteosarcomas. Our data may contribute to further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying osteosarcomas induced by ionizing radiation in human.",Excluded,0.9359997
608,"Telomere length in human adults and high level natural background radiation BACKGROUND: Telomere length is considered as a biomarker of aging, stress, cancer. It has been associated with many chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Although, telomere shortening due to ionizing radiation has been reported in vitro, no in vivo data is available on natural background radiation and its effect on telomere length. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The present investigation is an attempt to determine the telomere length among human adults residing in high level natural radiation areas (HLNRA) and the adjacent normal level radiation areas (NLNRA) of Kerala coast in Southwest India. Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 310 individuals (HLNRA: N = 233 and NLNRA: N = 77). Telomere length was determined using real time q-PCR. Both telomere (T) and single copy gene (S) specific primers were used to calculate the relative T/S and expressed as the relative telomere length. The telomere length was determined to be 1.22+/-0.15, 1.12+/-0.15, 1.08+/-0.08, 1.12+/-0.11, respectively, among the four dose groups (</=1.50, 1.51-3.00, 3.01-5.00 and >5.00 mGy per year), which did not show any dose response. The results suggested that the high level natural chronic radiation did not have significant effect on telomere length among young adult population living in HLNRA, which is indicative of better repair of telomeric ends. No significant difference in telomere length was observed between male and female individuals. In the present investigation, although the determination of telomere length was studied among the adults with an age group between 18 to 40 years (mean maternal age: 26.10+/-4.49), a negative correlation was observed with respect to age. However, inter-individual variation was (0.81-1.68) was clearly observed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In this preliminary investigation, we conclude that elevated level of natural background radiation has no significant effect on telomere length among the adult population residing in HLNRAs of Kerala coast. To our knowledge, this is the first report from HLNRAs of the world where telomere length was determined on human adults. However, more samples from each background dose group and samples from older population need to be studied to derive firm conclusions.",Excluded,0.93598473

The conditions of such hazards are investigated in theory and practice making allowance for the different susceptibility to trouble of various models of permanent pacemakers. It appears that no extension of long-term follow-up of the cardiac pacemaker's function is needed with regard to possible late effects of ionizing radiation, but that the follow-up of pacemaker-patients during their first period of treatment should not be neglected, since other sources of electronic interference may be present. Routine checks as radiotherapy installations should also include possible sources of disturbance to electronic pacemakers.",Excluded,0.9359486
644,"Background radiation impacts human longevity and cancer mortality: reconsidering the linear no-threshold paradigm The current linear no-threshold paradigm assumes that any exposure to ionizing radiation carries some risk, thus every effort should be made to maintain the exposures as low as possible. We examined whether background radiation impacts human longevity and cancer mortality. Our data covered the entire US population of the 3139 US counties, encompassing over 320 million people. This is the first large-scale study which takes into account the two major sources of background radiation (terrestrial radiation and cosmic radiation), covering the entire US population. Here, we show that life expectancy, the most integrative index of population health, was approximately 2.5 years longer in people living in areas with a relatively high vs. low background radiation. (>= 180 mrem/year and <= 100 mrem/year, respectively; p < 0.005; 95% confidence interval [CI]). This radiation-induced lifespan extension could to a great extent be associated with the decrease in cancer mortality rate observed for several common cancers (lung, pancreas and colon cancers for both genders, and brain and bladder cancers for males only; p < 0.05; 95% CI). Exposure to a high background radiation displays clear beneficial health effects in humans. These hormetic effects provide clear indications for re-considering the linear no-threshold paradigm, at least within the natural range of low-dose radiation.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",Excluded,0.9358897

403,"Pregnancy X-rays and childhood cancers: effec of exposure age and radiation dose Using data from the Oxford Survey of Childhood Cancers this paper examines the effect of foetal age and number of films used on the subsequent risk of childhood cancer associated with prenatal x-rays. X-rays early in pregnancy were taken for different reasons and required more films when compared with those taken in late pregnancy. Therefore, Mantel-Haenszel techniques were used to estimate the independent effects of (a) exposure age and (b) number of films. Age at exposure had a clearly significant effect; x-rays taken in the first trimester of pregnancy were 2.69 times as effective as x-rays taken in the third trimester. First trimester exposure were often the result of maternal illnesses so these maternal illnesses were then included among the controlling factors. When this was done the first trimester x-rays were 2.73 times as effective as later exposures. First trimester x-rays were most strongly associated with the cancers which were diagnosed between 4 and 5 years of age. Although the number of films had no detectable effect upon relative risk calculated over all ages, multiple exposures were demonstrably associated with early age at diagnosis.",Excluded,0.9357796
960,"RadRAT: a radiation risk assessment tool for lifetime cancer risk projection Risk projection methods allow for timely assessment of the potential magnitude of radiation-related cancer risks following low-dose radiation exposures. The estimation of such risks directly through observational studies would generally require infeasibly large studies and long-term follow-up to achieve reasonable statistical power. We developed an online radiation risk assessment tool (RadRAT) which can be used to estimate the lifetime risk of radiation-related cancer with uncertainty intervals following a user-specified exposure history (https://irep.nci.nih.gov/radrat). The uncertainty intervals constitute a key component of the program because of the various assumptions that are involved in such calculations. The risk models used in RadRAT are broadly based on those developed by the BEIR VII committee for estimating lifetime risk following low-dose radiation exposure of the US population for eleven site-specific cancers. We developed new risk models for seven additional cancer sites, oral, oesophagus, gallbladder, pancreas, rectum, kidney and brain/central nervous system (CNS) cancers, using data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The lifetime risk estimates are slightly higher for RadRAT than for BEIR VII across all exposure ages mostly because the weighting of the excess relative risk and excess absolute risk models was conducted on an arithmetic rather than a logarithmic scale. The calculator can be used to estimate lifetime cancer risk from both uniform and non-uniform doses that are acute or chronic. It is most appropriate for low-LET radiation doses < 1 Gy, and for individuals with life-expectancy and cancer rates similar to the general population in the US.",Excluded,0.9357059
963,"High incidence of mosaic mutations induced by irradiating paternal germ cells of the medaka fish, Oryzias latipes Delayed-type mutations induced by radiation have recently been demonstrated in various somatic-cell systems. Such mutations are thought to result from the transmission of genetic instability through many cell divisions subsequent to a single exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, we have examined whether 'transgenerational' delayed-type mutations can arise during embryonic development of the medaka fish as a result of exposing the sperm and spermatids of live fish to 137 Cs gamma-radiation. To do this, we made use of a sensitive specific-locus test (SLT) for the medaka that we have recently developed. Because the medaka has a transparent egg membrane and embryo body, both visible mosaics and whole-body mutations can be detected during development at an early-expressed pigmentation locus. When wild-type +/+ males were gamma-irradiated and then mated with wl/wl females, the frequency of F1 embryos with both wild-type orange leucophores (wl/+) and mutant-type white leucophores (wl/wl*) (mosaic mutants) was about 5.7 x 10-3/Gy. The frequency of embryos with only white leucophores (whole-body mutants) was about 1.3 x 10-3/Gy. These results suggest that delayed mutations frequently arise in medaka fish embryos that have been fertilized with irradiated sperm. Some possible mechanisms involved in the generation of these delayed mutational events (including genomic instability in the early embryos) are discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded,0.9355768
241,"Towards the control of chikungunya vector in la Reunion using the sterile insect technique: Sexual competitiveness and mating success of sterilized males Aedes albopictus The sterile insect technique (SIT) is widely used as part of area-wide integrated pest management programs for insects such as fruit fies, screw-worm fies and tsetse fies. It is based on the releases of large numbers of sterile males, which transfer their sterile sperm to wild females for the fertilization of the eggs, resulting in embryonic death. The lack of offspring could then lead to a decrease of the wild population density. The SIT is currently being developed at the FAO/IAEA in Vienna and on La Reunion, France, for the potential control of Aedes albopictus, vector of Chikungunya and secondary vector of Dengue viruses. In this context, we investigated the impact of the sterilisation process on male mating success and sexual competitiveness in the laboratory and under semi-feld conditions. Males from a young laboratory colony (F4) were irradiated as pupae (>20h old) with gamma-rays at 35 or 40 Gy. In the laboratory, the time for male sexual maturation was not affected by the irradiation, neither was the insemination rate of 4 days old males as compared to un-irradiated ones. The daily individual mating success of sterile males during 15 days was reduced as compared to un-irradiated males; however the differences were signifcant only during the second week. Sterility was maintained over successive matings and after a resting period. Under semi-feld conditions, sterile males competed well against wild males, though a resting period of 5 days in the laboratory before release greatly improved their effciency. A ratio of fve sterile to one wild male resulted in a two-fold reduction of the wild females' mean fertility. Valuable information on the effects of the sterilization process was collected and it is suggested that an effcient reduction of a wild population might be achieved by releasing sterile males as adults. Moreover, the results indicate that a resting period allows a recovery from radiation-induced somatic damages which improved the biological quality of the males.",Excluded,0.93555236

To determine the susceptibility of DS lymphocytes at G<inf>2</inf> phase, bleomycin, a radiomimetic agent, was used to induce DNA breaks in blood cultures from 24 Down syndrome patients. All the patients with DS showed free trisomy 21 (47,XX + 21 or 47,XY + 21). Individuals that showed an average number of chromatid breaks per cell higher than 0.8 were considered sensitive to the drug. No control child showed susceptibility to bleomycin, and among the 24 patients with DS, only one was sensitive to the drug. No significant difference was observed between the two groups, regarding chromatid break frequencies in treated G<inf>2</inf> lymphocytes. The distribution of bleomycin-induced breaks in each group of chromosomes was similar for DS and controls. No significant difference was found in the response to bleomycin between male and female subjects. Probably, the main factor involved in chromosome sensitivity of lymphocytes from patients with DS is the phase of the cell cycle in which the cell is treated.",Excluded,0.93554693
413,"Soft-tissue allografts terminally sterilized with an electron beam are biomechanically equivalent to aseptic, nonsterilized tendons BACKGROUND: Allograft safety is contingent on effective sterilization. However, current sterilization methods have been associated with decreased biomechanical strength and higher failure rates of soft-tissue allografts. In this study, electron beam (e-beam) sterilization was explored as an alternative sterilization method to preserve biomechanical integrity. We hypothesized that e-beam sterilization would not significantly alter the biomechanical properties of tendon allograft compared with aseptic, nonsterilized controls and gamma-irradiated grafts., METHODS: Separate sets of forty fresh-frozen tibialis tendon allografts (four from each of ten donors) and forty bisected bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) allografts (four from each of ten donors) were randomly assigned to four study groups. One group received a 17.1 to 21.0-kGy gamma radiation dose; two other groups were sterilized with an e-beam at either a high (17.1 to 21.0-kGy) or low (9.2 to 12.2-kGy) dose. A fourth group served as nonsterilized controls. Each graft was cyclically loaded to 200 N of tension for 2000 cycles at a frequency of 2 Hz, allowed to relax for five minutes, and then tested in tension until failure at a 100%/sec strain rate. One-way analysis of variance testing was used to identify significant differences., RESULTS: Tibialis tendons sterilized with both e-beam treatments and with gamma irradiation exhibited values for cyclic tendon elongation, maximum load, maximum displacement, stiffness, maximum stress, maximum strain, and elastic modulus that were not significantly different from those of nonsterilized controls. BTB allografts sterilized with the high e-beam dose and with gamma irradiation were not significantly different in cyclic tendon elongation, maximum load, maximum displacement, stiffness, maximum stress, maximum strain, and elastic modulus from nonsterilized controls. BTB allografts sterilized with the e-beam at the lower dose were significantly less stiff than nonsterilized controls (p = 0.014) but did not differ from controls in any other properties. The difference in stiffness likely resulted from variations in tendon size rather than the treatments, as the elastic moduli of the groups were similar., CONCLUSIONS: The biomechanical properties of tibialis and BTB allografts sterilized with use of an e-beam at a dose range of 17.1 to 21.0 kGy were not different from those of aseptic, nonsterilized controls or gamma-irradiated allografts., CLINICAL RELEVANCE: E-beam sterilization can be a viable method to produce safe and biomechanically uncompromised soft-tissue allografts.

1053,"Variant Splicing and Influence of Ionizing Radiation on Human Endogenous Retrovirus K (HERV-K) Transcripts in Cancer Cell Lines Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) is the most intact retrovirus in the human genome. There are multiple full-length or near full-length HERV-K proviruses in it. To analyze which HERV-K proviruses give rise to viral transcripts in cancer cell lines and to test whether ionizing radiation can alter the levels of HERV-K transcripts, RT-PCR studies were undertaken using multiple human cancer cell lines. Primers from several positions in the viral genome were used and included pairs designed to cross splice junctions in viral RNAs. In the absence of ionizing radiation, transcripts were detected from multiple HERV-K proviruses in cell lines from human prostate, cervical, head and neck, or breast cancers, and the proviruses from which the transcripts originated varied among the different lines. Only one of 13 cell lines tested (cervical cancer line C33A) failed to show HERV-K transcripts. Spliced RNAs detected included viral RNAs spliced as expected at the conventional viral splice sites, plus several alternatively spliced RNAs. Alternatively spliced transcripts arose from specific proviruses, and were detected in most of the cell lines used. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to assess the effects of ionizing radiation. These analyses showed that HERV-K transcripts were elevated in four of twelve lines tested, specifically all three prostate cancer lines used and one breast cancer line. The increases were transient, peaking at 24 hours following a single dose of gamma-irradiation that ranged from 2.5 to 20 Gy, and returning to baseline levels by 72 hours. In summary, these studies showed that ionizing radiation can affect the levels of HERV-K transcripts in cells, and these effects vary among different cells. The changes in HERV-K transcript levels might affect multiple biological processes in cells, and future studies of the effects of ionizing radiation on HERV-K are worth pursuing. © 2013 Agoni et al.",Excluded,0.93503934

The patients received radiation therapy for head and neck cancer at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. For each patient the 3D dose distribution delivered to the upper 5 cm of the oesophagus was analysed. The analysis was conducted for two periods, 1992-2000 and 2001-2005, due to the different irradiation techniques used. The fitting has been done using the relative seriality model., RESULTS: For the treatment period 1992-2005, the mean doses were 49.8 and 33.4 Gy, respectively, for the cases and the controls. For the period 1992-2000, the mean doses for the cases and the controls were 49.9 and 45.9 Gy and for the period 2001-2005 were 49.8 and 21.4 Gy. For the period 2001-2005 the best estimates of the dose-response parameters are D(50)=61.5 Gy (52.9-84.9 Gy), gamma=1.4 (0.8-2.6) and s=0.1 (0.01-0.3)., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced strictures were found to have a dose response relation and volume dependence (low relative seriality) for the treatment period 2001-2005.

301,"Somatic-cell mutations as a possible predictor of cancer risk The somatic-mutation theory of carcinogenesis has received strong scientific support from results of recent studies on tumor-suppressor genes. We anticipated that people among the high risk for cancer group, either through exposure to various ionizing radiations or by virtue of unique genotypes, would also manifest increased frequencies of somatic mutation. This report presents the results of two somatic-mutation assays--at the erythrocyte glycophorin A (GPA) and lymphocyte T-cell receptor (TCR) genes--in various groups at high risk for cancer development, including atomic-bomb survivors, patients with various cancers, patients administered Thorotrast, and patients with genetic disorders that make them cancer prone. Although neither the GPA-mutation nor the TCR-mutation assay detects gene mutations directly related to carcinogenesis, increased mutation frequencies were detected by both assays in many individuals among the high-risk groups and among cancer patients. We have continued to follow up those individuals who show values of about three times higher than those of the control group. Thus, these assays may prove useful for identifying high-risk cancer groups and for estimating the effects of mutagens.

The main limitation of the assay is the large variability observed in the baseline values of micronuclei (MNi) and other nuclear anomalies mainly related to different scoring criteria. The aim of this international collaborative study, involving laboratories with different level of experience, was to evaluate the inter- and intra-laboratory variations in the BMNcyt parameters, using recently implemented guidelines, in scoring cells from the same pooled samples obtained from healthy subjects (control group) and from cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (treated group). The results indicate that all laboratories correctly discriminated samples from the two groups by a significant increase of micronucleus (MN) and nuclear bud (NBUD) frequencies and differentiated binucleated (BN) cells, associated with the exposure to ionizing radiation. The experience of the laboratories was shown to play an important role in the identification of the different cell types and nuclear anomalies. MN frequency in differentiated mononucleated (MONO) and BN cells showed the greatest consistency among the laboratories and low variability was also detected in the frequencies of MONO and BN cells. A larger variability was observed in classifying the different cell types, indicating the subjectivity in the interpretation of some of the scoring criteria while reproducibility of the results between scoring sessions was very good. An inter-laboratory calibration exercise is strongly recommended before starting studies with BMNcyt assay involving multiple research centers. Copyright © The Author 2016.

A matched case-control study was conducted using those who died of NPC during the period 1987-1995. Two controls were randomly selected for each case from those who died from causes other than malignancies and external causes. Cases and their controls were matched with respect to sex and the years of birth and death (+/- 5 years). Study subjects' next-of-kin were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire to collect information on socioeconomic status, dietary habits, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption, disease history, pesticide use, medical X-ray exposure, the family history of NPC and so on. We succeeded in interviewing 97 cases and 192 controls. Univariate conditional logistic regression analysis showed that NPC risk was associated with the consumption of salted fish, homemade pickles, and fermented soy beans, education levels, the history of chronic rhinitis, and the family history of NPC. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that education levels (Odds ratio (OR) for middle school or higher levels vs. no school education = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.2 to 11.8), salted fish intake (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.7 to 6.1), the history of chronic rhinitis (OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.3 to 10.1), and the family history of NPC (OR = 14.2, 95% CI = 2.7 to 73.4) were independent risk factors of NPC. Tobacco smoking (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.7 to 2.1), and alcohol consumption (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.5 to 1.9) were not significantly related to NPC risk.

Then the thymus were taken out after the mice were decapitated. Thymus index, morphological characteristics of thymus were examined. The changes of thymus T-cell subgroups, cell cycle progression in thymocytes and cellular apoptosis were detected with flow cytometry (FCM). RESULT(S): The body weights of animals in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups [(28.10 +/- 1.46), (27.50 +/- 2.52) g] were lower than that of the control [(31.95 +/- 2.51) g] (P < 0.05). Pathological observation showed dark red piece of nucleus, some nuclei inclined to one side, slight increase in hassall body.

Carcinogenic estimates were calculated with and without a correction factor accounting for cancer patients' advanced age and reduced longevity., RESULTS: For the model assuming a plateau in risk above 2-Gy single-fraction-equivalent (SFE), IMRT and 3D-CRT produced risks of 1.7% and 2.1%, respectively, for prostate; 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively, for nasopharynx; 1% each for tonsil; and 1.4-2.2% and 1.5-1.6%, respectively, depending on technique, for breast. Assuming a reduction in risk above 2-Gy SFE, risks for IMRT and 3D-CRT were 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively, for prostate; 1.4% and 1.2%, respectively, for nasopharynx; 1% each for tonsil; and 1.3-1.8% vs. 1.3-1.6%, respectively, for breast. Applying a correction factor of 0.5 for cancer patients halved these risks and their relative differences., CONCLUSIONS: Carcinogenic risks were comparable in absolute terms between modalities. Risks are dependant on technique used. Risks with IMRT are influenced by monitor unit demand and are therefore software/hardware dependant. The dose-response model accounting for cell killing at higher doses fitted best with actual observed risks.",Excluded,0.93434656
804,"Cause-of-death registers in radiation-contaminated areas of the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan Since the early 1990s, information on radiation-exposed populations other than those exposed from the Chernobyl accident in 1986 has become increasingly available for international scientific research. It is essential to understand how the cohorts of exposed populations have been defined and what mechanisms can be used to study their health outcomes. Different international scientific research collaborations currently investigate four population groups chronically exposed to ionizing radiation during the late 1940s and early 1950s in the Russian Federation and in Kazakhstan. In this framework, collaborations have been established to develop cause-of-death registers in each of these four areas for future mortality follow-up purposes with the aim of studying the health effects of ionizing radiation. The emphasis of this effort is on assessing the information sources available, the mechanisms of data collection and coding, and the data quality and completeness of the information collected. One of the major challenges is the harmonization of all these aspects between the four different centers to the extent possible, taking into account that much of the actual data has been collected over many decades.",Excluded,0.93411773

The tests such as 9-day bone marrow cellularity (BMC) and endogenous CFUs, the neutrophile number restoration, the 30-day survival index have shown that all three preparations have an approximately equal effectiveness relating to acute radiation disease treatment and granulopoiesis stimulation after a 5-10 day consecutive administration following irradiation of mice at lethal and sublethal doses.

962,"The impact of lymphocyte isolation on induced DNA damage in human blood samples measured by the comet assay The comet assay is frequently used in human biomonitoring for the detection of exposure to genotoxic agents. Peripheral blood samples are most frequently used and tested either as whole blood or after isolation of lymphocytes (i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMC). To investigate a potential impact of lymphocyte isolation on induced DNA damage in human blood samples, we exposed blood ex vivo to mutagens with different modes of genotoxic action. The comet assay was performed either directly with whole blood at the end of the exposure period or with lymphocytes isolated directly after exposure. In addition to the recommended standard protocol for lymphocyte isolation, a shortened protocol was established to optimise the isolation procedure. The results indicate that the effects of induced DNA strand breaks and alkali-labile sites induced by ionising radiation and alkylants, respectively, are significantly reduced in isolated lymphocytes. In contrast, oxidative DNA base damage (induced by potassium bromate) and stable bulky adducts (induced by benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide; BPDE) seem to be less affected. Our findings suggest that in vivo-induced DNA damage might also be reduced in isolated lymphocytes in comparison with the whole blood depending of the types of DNA damage induced. Because only small genotoxic effects can generally be expected in human biomonitoring studies with the comet assay after occupational and environmental exposure to genotoxic agents, any loss might be relevant and should be avoided. The possibility of such effects and their potential impact on variability of comet assay results in human biomonitoring should be considered when performing or evaluating such kind of studies.

Because irradiation is not always readily available, 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine (IUDR) treatment of cells was investigated as a substitute procedure. IUDR-treated cells were found to be as sensitive to C. trachomatis infection as were irradiated McCoy cells. Stock chlamydial strains gave similar titers of iodine-stained inclusions in either system. When cells treated with IUDR were compared with irradiated cells for the isolation of C. trachomatis from clinical specimens, 5 of 138 specimens yielded isolates in IUDR-treated cells not found in irradiated ones, and one isolate was obtained from irradiated but not from IUDR-treated cells. In those 56 cases where inclusions were seen in both systems, there were significantly more inclusions in IUDR-treated than in irradiated cells. Although this series of cultures is too small to determine whether IUDR-treated cells are superior to irradiated ones for the isolation of C. trachomatis, the data indicate that IUDR treatment is at least equally effective.",Excluded,0.9332226

374,"Risk assessment for developing gliomas: A comparison of two cytogenetic approaches Chromosome instability (CIN) measured as chromosome aberrations has long been suggested as a cancer susceptibility biomarker. Conventional cytogenetic end-points are now being improved by combining molecular methods, which increases the sensitivity, specificity, and precision of the assay. In this study we examined both spontaneous and gamma-ray induced CIN in lymphocyte cultures from 51 previously untreated glioma patients and 51 age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched controls. CIN was assessed using two parallel methods: (1) the mutagen sensitivity (MS) assay and (2) the multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. The frequency of spontaneous breaks was significantly higher in glioma patients (mean +/- S.D., 2.12 +/- 1.07) than in controls (1.24 +/- 0.86, P < 0.001) when using the FISH assay but not the MS assay (0.019 +/- 0.02 and 0.019 +/- 0.01, respectively; P = 0.915). Similarly, the frequency of induced chromatid breaks was significantly higher using the FISH assay (3.39 +/- 1.72) but not the MS assay (0.42 +/- 0.16) in the patients versus controls (2.08 +/- 1.18 and 0.37 +/- 0.15, respectively; P < 0.001 and P = 0.10, respectively). By using the median number of breaks in the controls as the cutoff value, we observed an odds ratio (ORs) of 5.13 (95% CI = 2.23-12.1) for spontaneous and 4.86 (95% CI = 2.08-11.4) for induced CIN using the FISH assay, whereas the ORs were 1.32 (95% CI = 0.49-3.58) and 1.28 (95% CI = 0.59-2.80) for spontaneous and induced CIN using the MS assay. There was also a significant increase in the frequency of hyperdiploid cells in the glioma cases which could only be detected using the FISH assay (OR = 4.0, 95% CL = 0.9-17.0). By combining both methods an estimated risk of 7.0 (95% CI = 1.7-25.6) was observed. There was no correlation between the breaks detected by the two methods suggesting that each method is a measure of a different event. The results indicate that using the multicolor FISH assay for detection of CIN in peripheral blood lymphocytes in glioma patients is a more useful marker for risk assessment. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded,0.9330504
1077,"Consequences of the radiation accident at the Mayak production association in 1957 (the 'Kyshtym Accident') This paper presents an overview of the nuclear accident that occurred at the Mayak Production Association (PA) in the Russian Federation on 29 September 1957, often referred to as 'Kyshtym Accident', when 20 MCi (740 PBq) of radionuclides were released by a chemical explosion in a radioactive waste storage tank. 2 MCi (74 PBq) spread beyond the Mayak PA site to form the East Urals Radioactive Trace (EURT). The paper describes the accident and gives brief characteristics of the efficacy of the implemented protective measures that made it possible to considerably reduce doses to the exposed population. The paper also provides retrospective dosimetry estimates for the members of the EURT Cohort (EURTC) which comprises approximately 21 400 people. During the first two years after the accident a decrease in the group average leukocyte (mainly due to neutrophils and lymphocytes) and thrombocyte count was observed in the population.

1033,"Platelet-rich plasma as a potential therapeutic approach against lead nitrate- and/or gamma radiation-induced hepatotoxicity Because of the potential regenerative and cytoprotective effects of its content of numerous bioactive growth factors and cytokines, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) became an attractive biomaterial for therapeutic purposes. Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity. To do so, hepatotoxicity was induced in rats by intraperitoneal administration of lead nitrate (7.5 mg/kg) thrice weekly for two consecutive weeks and/or a whole-body gamma-irradiation at a single dose of 6 Gy. Activated PRP (0.5 ml/kg) was injected subcutaneously 24 h after the last dose of lead nitrate and/or gamma-irradiation and continued twice weekly for three successive weeks. Lead nitrate intoxication and/or gamma-irradiation resulted in a significant elevation of serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities accompanied with a significant decrease in serum levels of total protein and albumin. Further, a significant increase in malondialdehyde level and nitric oxide content accompanied with a significant decrease in the reduced glutathione content and the enzyme activities of glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were observed. Additionally, hepatic extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling pathways were stimulated. PRP treatment notably ameliorated the induced cell injury, reduced the intracellular oxidative and interestingly increased the upregulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Akt. Moreover, PRP treatment relieved lead nitrate and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatic histological damages. In conclusion, this study sheds the light on a probable therapeutic role of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity which might attribute to its ability to activate ERK and Akt signaling pathways.",Excluded,0.9321857
832,"Production of androgenetic diploid loach by cold-shock of eggs fertilized with diploid sperm Diploid androgenotes were produced without egg irradiation in the loach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus. Eggs of wild-type diploid females were fertilized with diploid sperm of a neo-tetraploid male and then cold-shock treated at 3 degreeC (range, +/-0.5 degreeC) for 30 minutes just after fertilization to eliminate the female nucleus. After hatching, ploidy status of the hatched larvae was analyzed by flow cytometry, which revealed putative diploid androgenotes as well as larvae possessing other ploidies. Five independent microsatellite DNA markers were genotyped to confirm all-male inheritance of the resultant diploid larvae. The mean +/- SD yield rate of diploid androgenetic larvae to total eggs used was 12.29 +/- 3.25% in the cold-shock group and 22.23 +/- 13.42% in the UV-irradiated group (P > 0.05).

487,"Radioprotection of hematopoietic stem cells by interleukin-1 Radioprotective agents such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), when given prior to irradiation, protect animals from radiation damage. However, in vivo administration of these cytokines does not allow one to determine whether the protective effects act directly on the hematopoietic system. In the present study, we subjected male bone marrow cells to in vitro treatment with IL-1 prior to irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. We found that male bone marrow cells pretreated with IL-1 prior to irradiation increased the survival of irradiated female recipient mice when compared with nontreated irradiated marrow cells. In addition, irradiated female recipients that received IL-1-pretreated male donor bone marrow cells displayed an increased presence of male donor cells in their bone marrow, spleen, and thymus for up to 3 months posttransplant. Furthermore, serial transplantation studies revealed that male cells could only be detected in tertiary female recipients who received bone marrow from mice transplanted with IL-1-treated cells. These results indicate that IL-1 pretreatment protects both short-term and long-term repopulating stem cells from an irradiation insult and that these cells are capable of reconstituting the myeloid and lymphoid organs of recipient mice.",Excluded,0.93163466

Tumor volume and tumor growth delay (GD(V2)) were determined in tumors growing in NMRI (nu/nu) nude mice, treated with (a) BIBW 2992 (20 mg kg(-1) body weight orally), BIBW 2669 (3-4 mg kg(-1) body weight orally) or carrier until a final tumor diameter of 15 mm, or, (b) 3 days before a 20-Gy single-dose irradiation or, (c) after a 20-Gy single-dose irradiation until reaching the final tumor diameter., RESULTS: BIBW 2992 and BIBW 2669 significantly increased the doubling time of FaDu cells in vitro. A marked dose-dependent antiproliferative effect with blockade of the cells in G0/G1-phase of the cell cycle was found. Incubation with BIBW 2669 or BIBW 2992 for 3 days marginally increased radiosensitivity of FaDu cells in vitro. For BIBW 2992, this effect was statistically significant (p = 0.006). Daily oral application of BIBW 2669 or BIBW 2992 in mice bearing unirradiated FaDu tumors showed a marked antiproliferative effect with a significant prolongation of tumor growth delay (p < 0.0001). After drug application for 3 days, followed by 20-Gy single-dose irradiation, a slight effect of both drugs on tumor growth delay was seen. For BIBW 2669, this effect was statistically significant (p = 0.007). However, this effect disappeared when tumor volumes were normalized to the time point of irradiation suggesting that both drugs showed no or only a slight radiosensitizing effect in vivo. Daily application of BIBW 2669 or BIBW 2992 after a single-dose irradiation showed a clear inhibition of tumor growth with a significantly longer tumor growth delay after drug treatment compared to control tumors (p < 0.002). Enhancement ratios were smaller for irradiated than for unirradiated tumors, suggesting an additive effect for combinations with radiotherapy. In all treatment arms, the effects of BIBW 2669 were not significantly different from BIBW 2992., CONCLUSION: BIBW 2669 and BIBW 2992 showed a clear antiproliferative effect in vitro, whereas radiosensitization was only marginal.

480,"Evaluation of cancer tests of 1,3-butadiene using internal dose, genotoxic potency, and a multiplicative risk model In cancer tests with 1,3-butadiene (BD), the mouse is much more sensitive than the rat. This is considered to be related to the metabolism of BD to the epoxide metabolites, 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (EB), 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane, and 1,2-epoxy-3,4-butanediol. This study evaluates whether the large difference in outcome in cancer tests with BD could be predicted quantitatively on the basis of the concentration over time in blood (AUC) of the epoxide metabolites, their mutagenic potency, and a multiplicative cancer risk model, which has earlier been used for ionizing radiation. Published data on hemoglobin adduct levels from inhalation experiments with BD were used for the estimation of the AUC of the epoxide metabolites in the cancer tests. The estimated AUC of the epoxides were then weighed together to a total genotoxic dose, by using the relative genotoxic potency of the respective epoxide inferred from in vitro hprt mutation assays using EB as standard. The tumor incidences predicted with the risk model on the basis of the total genotoxic dose correlated well with the earlier observed tumor incidences in the cancer tests. The total genotoxic dose that leads to a doubling of the tumor incidences was estimated to be the same in both species, 9 to 10 mmol/Lxh EB-equivalents. The study validates the applicability of the multiplicative cancer risk model to genotoxic chemicals. Furthermore, according to this evaluation, different epoxide metabolites are predominating cancer-initiating agents in the cancer tests with BD, the diepoxide in the mouse, and the monoepoxides in the rat.",Excluded,0.9312677

Nitrosative stress occurs when the generations of highly Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS) such as nitric oxide (NO) exceed the ability of the human body to neutralize and eliminate them. It may lead to nitrosylation reactions that can alter protein structure by inhibiting normal body functions. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether RF Fields at non - thermal level can affect total NO (NOx) and antioxidant levels in plasma thus cause nitrosative stress. Twenty-four male and female Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Group I and Group II: male (n=6) and female (n=6) control groups, Group III and Group IV: male (n=6) and female (n=6) RF radiation exposed groups. The exposed groups of rats were exposed to non - thermal RF radiation 20 min/day for a month. NOx (nitrite/nitrate) levels were measured by Griess assay using Elisa reader. The total sulfhydryl (RSH) levels were determined spectrophotometrically by Kurtel method. The exposure to RF Radiation for a month caused significant increase in NOx plasma levels in male and female rats (p < 0.05). Conversely RSH levels were significantly lower in exposed rats compared to control rats (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in the rectal temperature between control and RF - irradiated rats (p > 0.05). In the present study, we showed that plasma NOx level may be increased in both male and female rats due to RF radiation exposure.

Chemoradiotherapy gives better results than radiotherapy or chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. To enhance radiosensitivity of tumor cells for chemoradiotherapy, targeted therapy drugs that act as radiosensitizers can be used. In the present study, we provide a scientific rationale for the clinical application of sorafenib as a radiosensitizer in colorectal cancer, without causing significant adverse effects on normal intestinal tissue., METHODS: Three human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCT116, HT-29, and SW480) were treated with sorafenib alone, or radiation followed by sorafenib. In vitro tests were performed using colony forming assays, cell cycle analysis, and comet assays. In addition, the effects of sorafenib and radiation therapy on the inhibition HT-29 tumor growth and survival of intestinal jejunum crypts were examined in vivo., RESULTS: Sorafenib increased the radiosensitivity of tumor cells in human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCT116, HT-29, and SW480), as well as in HT-29 xenograft animal models. Sorafenib, in combination with ionizing radiation, induced the accumulation of tumor cells in the G2-M phase and delayed the repair of DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation.

751,"Lifetime attributable risk of cancer from CT among patients surviving severe traumatic brain injury OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the lifetime attributable risk of cancer from CT among patients surviving severe traumatic brain injury., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted with prospectively collected data on patients 16 years old and older admitted with a Glasgow coma scale score of 8 or less to a single level 1 trauma center from 2007 to 2010. The effective dose of each CT examination the patients underwent was predicted with literature-accepted effective dose values of standard helical CT protocols. The lifetime attributable risk of cancer and related mortality incurred as a result of CT were estimated with the cumulative effective dose incurred from the time of injury to a 1-year follow-up evaluation and with the approach established by the Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII report., RESULTS: The average patient was a 34-year-old man. The median number of CT examinations received during the first 12 months after injury was 20, and the average cumulative effective dose was 87 +/- 45 mSv. This resulted in increases in the lifetime incidence of all cancer types from 45.5% to 46.3% and in the lifetime incidence of cancer-related mortality from 22.1% to 22.5%., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure from the use of CT in the evaluation and management of severe traumatic brain injury causes negligible increases in lifetime attributable risk of cancer and cancer-related mortality.

Three weeks post-inoculation, the right leg of 12 rats bearing the tumor nodule was treated with BPA-BNCT (BPA-Boronophenylalanine) at the RA-3 nuclear reactor located in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at an absorbed dose of 7.5 Gy to skin as the dose-limiting tissue. The remaining group of 14 tumor-bearing rats were left untreated and used as control. Two weeks post-BNCT, 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb cells were injected subcutaneously in the contralateral left hind flank of each of the 26 BDIX rats. Tumor volume in both legs was measured weekly for 7 weeks to determine response to BNCT in the right leg and to assess a potential influence of BNCT in the right leg on tumor development in the left leg.

In addition, a statistically significant reduction in contralateral left leg tumor volume was observed in BNCT-responsive animals (post/pre <1) vs untreated animals, i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 254 +/- 251 mm3.

860,"[Death inducing ligands in combination with ionizing radiation: objective and current knowledge] BACKGROUND: Apart from optimization of the radiation technology, future new strategies in radiation oncology will focus on the biological optimisation leading to improved adaptation of the tumor therapy on each tumor entity. In this regard, different areas of biological research may be distinguished: prediction, development of new cytotoxic agents, improvement of the tolerance of normal tissue and the optimisation of radiochemotherapy., MATERIAL AND METHOD: For the development of new strategies the knowledge of molecular mechanisms of radiation induced cell death is essential. In the present article a novel biological strategy for optimisation of radiotherapy is introduced., RESULTS: Distinct pathways mediate apoptosis in response to death receptor stimulation and ionizing radiation although an overlapping set of molecules is involved. TRAIL (TNF alpha-related apoptosis inducing ligand) is a type-II membrane protein belonging to the TNF family, which preferentially induces apoptotic cell death in a wide variety of tumor cells but not in normal cells. Based on the assumption of distinct signalling pathways, combination of TRAIL and ionizing radiation seems ideal to increase the therapeutic efficacy. Our study presents the rationale, own data, data of other groups as well as the current status of the latest findings regarding the function and physiological role of the TRAIL death ligand., CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis resistance towards ionising radiation is not associated with a general apoptosis resistance. Death ligands, for example TRAIL trigger apoptosis even in cells not undergoing apoptosis in response to radiation. A combination of both modalities induces additive or synergistic effects in regard to apoptosis induction and eradication of clonogenic tumor cells. Thus, the combination of TRAIL with radiation proofs that novel treatment strategies may be developed on the basis of molecular or cell biological research.",Excluded,0.926755
885,"Lung dosimetry of inhaled radon progeny in mice Biological response of exposure to radon progeny has long been investigated, but there are only few studies in which absorbed doses in lungs of laboratory animals were estimated. The present study is the first attempt to calculate the doses of inhaled radon progeny for mice. For reference, the doses for rats and humans were also computed with the corresponding models. Lung deposition of particles, their clearance, and energy deposition of alpha particles to sensitive tissues were systematically simulated. Absorbed doses to trachea and bronchi, bronchioles and terminal bronchioles, alveolar-interstitial regions, and whole lung were first provided as a function of monodisperse radon progeny particles with an equilibrium equivalent radon concentration of 1 Bq m(-3) (equilibrium factor, 0.4 and unattached fraction, 0.01). Based on the results, absorbed doses were then calculated for (1) a reference mine condition and (2) a condition previously used for animal experiments. It was found that the whole lung doses for mice, rats, and humans were 34.8, 20.7, and 10.7 nGy (Bq m(-3))(-1) h(-1) for the mine condition, respectively, while they were 16.9, 9.9, and 6.5 nGy (Bq m(-3))(-1) h(-1) for the animal experimental condition. In both cases, the values for mice are about 2 times higher than those for rats, and about 3 times higher than those for humans. Comparison of our data on rats and humans with those published in the literature shows an acceptable agreement, suggesting the validity of the present modeling for mice. In the future, a more sophisticated dosimetric study of inhaled radon progeny in mice would be desirable to demonstrate how anatomical, physiological, and environmental parameters can influence absorbed doses.",Excluded,0.92569566

Thirty-one dogs qualified for the study. Twenty dogs received curative radiotherapy (median total dose: 52.5 Gy) and eleven dogs were treated palliatively (3 x 8 Gy or 5 x 6 Gy). The time-to-progression for the curatively-treated dogs was 333 days versus 180 days for the palliatively-treated dogs (p=0.134). The overall survival was 331 days for the curative group and 310 days for the palliative group (p=0.2292).

994,"Dose conversion coefficients for neutron external exposures with five postures: walking, sitting, bending, kneeling, and squatting In a previous study, posture-dependent dose coefficients (DCs) for photon external exposures were calculated using the adult male and female mesh-type reference computational phantoms (MRCPs) of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) that had been transformed into five non-standing postures (i.e. walking, sitting, bending, kneeling, and squatting). As an extension, the present study was conducted to establish another DC dataset for external exposures to neutrons by performing Monte Carlo radiation transport simulations with the adult male and female MRCPs in the five non-standing postures. The resulting dataset included the DCs for absorbed doses (i.e., organ/tissue-averaged absorbed doses) delivered to 29 individual organs/tissues, and for effective doses for neutron energies ranging from 10-9 to 104 MeV in six irradiation geometries: antero-posterior (AP), posteroanterior (PA), left-lateral (LLAT), right-lateral (RLAT), rotational (ROT), and isotropic (ISO) geometries. The comparison of DCs for the non-standing MRCPs with those of the standing MRCPs showed significant differences. In the lateral irradiation geometries, for example, the standing MRCPs overestimate the breast DCs of the squatting MRCPs by up to a factor of 4 due to the different arm positions but underestimate the gonad DCs by up to about 17 times due to the different leg positions. The impact of different postures on effective doses was generally less than that on organ doses but still significant; for example, the standing MRCPs overestimate the effective doses of the bending MRCPs only by 20% in the AP geometry at neutron energies less than 50 MeV, but underestimate those of the kneeling MRCPs by up to 40% in the lateral geometries at energies less than 0.1 MeV.",Excluded,0.9233998
646,"Ex vivo radiosensitivity is increased in non-cancer patients taking valproate BACKGROUND: Valproate (VPA) is a commonly prescribed antiepileptic drug for patients experiencing epileptic seizures due to brain tumors. VPA increases radiation sensitivity in various tumor cells in vitro due to complex mechanisms. This could make tumors more vulnerable to ionizing radiation or overcome radioresistance. Yet, clinical data on possible improvement of tumor control by adding VPA to tumor therapy is controversial. Potentially radiosensitizing effects of VPA on healthy tissue remain unclear. To determine individual radiosensitivity, we analyzed blood samples of individuals taking VPA., METHODS: Ex vivo irradiated blood samples of 31 adult individuals with epilepsy were studied using 3-color fluorescence in situ hybridization. Aberrations in chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 were analyzed. Radiosensitivity was determined by the mean breaks per metaphase (B/M) and compared to age-matched (2:1) healthy donors., RESULTS: The patient cohort (n = 31; female: 38.7%) showed an increase of their average B/M value compared to healthy individuals (n = 61; female: 56.9%; B/M: 0.480 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.415 +/- 0.07; p = .001). The portion of radiosensitive (B/M > 0.500) and distinctly radiosensitive individuals (B/M > 0.600) was increased in the VPA group (54.9% vs. 11.3 and 9.7% vs. 0.0%; p < .001). In 3/31 patients, radiosensitivity was determined prior to and after VPA treatment and radiosensitivity was increased by VPA-treatment., CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we confirmed that patients treated with VPA had an increased radiosensitivity compared to the control group. This could be considered in patients taking VPA prior to the beginning of radiotherapy to avoid toxic side effects of VPA-treatment.",Excluded,0.9230327
243,"Hepatic irradiation augments engraftment of donor cells following hepatocyte transplantation Engraftment of donor hepatocytes is a critical step that determines the success of hepatocyte transplantation. Rapid and efficient integration of donor cells would enable prompt liver repopulation of these cells in response to selective proliferative stimuli offered by a preparative regimen. We have earlier demonstrated that hepatic irradiation (HIR) in combination with a variety of hepatotrophic growth signals, such as partial hepatectomy and hepatocyte growth factor, can be used as a preparative regimen for liver repopulation of transplanted hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated the effects of HIR on engraftment of transplanted dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV)-positive hepatocytes in congeneic DPPIV-deficient rats. HIR-induced apoptosis of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC) within 6 hours of HIR resulted in dehiscence of the SEC lining in 24 hours. Although there was no change of the number of Kupffer cells after HIR, colloidal carbon clearance decreased 24 hours post HIR, indicating a suppression of phagocytic function. DPPIV + donor cells were transplanted 24 hours after HIR (0-50 Gy). There was an HIR dose-dependent increase in the donor hepatocyte mass engrafted in the liver parenchyma. The number of viable transplanted hepatocytes present in hepatic sinusoids or integrated in the parenchyma was greater in the HIR-treated group at 3 and 7 days after transplantation compared with the sham controls. Finally, we validated these rodent studies in cynomolgus monkeys, demonstrating that a single 10-Gy dose of HIR was sufficient to enhance engraftment of donor porcine hepatocytes. These data indicate that transient disruption of the SEC barrier and inhibition of the phagocytic function of Kupffer cells by HIR enhances hepatocyte engraftment and the integrated donor cell mass. Thus, preparative HIR could be potentially useful to augment hepatocyte transplantation. Copyright © 2008 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded,0.92213583
1064,"The outcome of percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with in-stent restenosis who failed intracoronary radiation therapy OBJECTIVES: This study reports the outcome of patients who failed intracoronary radiation therapy (IRT) for the treatment of in-stent restenosis (ISR)., BACKGROUND: Intracoronary radiation therapy has demonstrated a reduction in the recurrence rate of restenosis for patients with ISR. However, 10% to 30% of these patients require repeat intervention to the irradiated site., METHODS: Of 961 patients who were assigned to gamma or beta radiation for the treatment of diffuse ISR, we evaluated the outcome of 282 (29%) consecutive patients who failed IRT and compared them with the 679 (71%) patients who had successful IRT. For patients who failed radiation, the mean time to the first target vessel revascularization (TVR) was 173 +/- 127 days after the index procedure and the total duration of follow-up was 494 +/- 304 days., RESULTS: Patients who failed IRT were younger (60 +/- 10 vs. 63 +/- 11 years, p = 0.002) and had a higher incidence of restenting (51% vs. 41%, p = 0.003). The majority (55%) of the restenotic lesions after IRT failure were focal (< or =10 mm), with a mean lesion length of 11.9 +/- 1.9 mm. Of the 257 patients who had subsequent TVR after failed IRT, 68 (26%) underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and 189 (74%) underwent percutaneous coronary intervention using balloon in 61%, restenting in 26%, atheroablation in 11%, and the cutting balloon in 2% of cases. At six months, 6% of patients died, 1% had Q-wave MI, 17% had repeat TVR, and the overall rate of major adverse cardiac events was 21%., CONCLUSIONS: The predominant angiographic pattern of lesions in patients who failed IRT is focal restenosis, with these lesions responding well to conventional revascularization methods.",Excluded,0.92101
402,"Underprediction of visibly complex chromosome aberrations by a recombinational-repair ('one-hit') model Purpose: Published low-LET FISH data were used to test two models of chromosome aberration production based on breakage-and-reunion or recombinational repair. Material(s) and Method(s): Randomness of DNA double strand break induction and misrejoining is analyzed comprehensively and adopted as a working hypothesis. Proximity effects are approximated by using interaction sites. Model results are calculated using CAS (chromosome aberration simulator) Monte Carlo computer software with two adjustable parameters. CAS can emulate the specifics of any experimental painting protocol, allowing very detailed tests of the models. Result(s): To reasonable approximation, breakage-and-reunion model predictions are consistent with low-LET FISH results, including two large, elaborate, one-paint data sets. An explicitly specified version of the recombinational-repair model severely underpredicts the frequency of the visibly complex aberration patterns most commonly observed with one-paint FISH, and is inconsistent with some observed multi-paint patterns. When high-dose effects (distortion and saturation) are taken into account quantitatively, a dose-response relation for apparently simple interchanges slightly favours the breakage-and-reunion model over the recombinational-repair model, despite being approximately linear over the dose range 2-6 Gy. Conclusion(s): The random breakage-and-reunion model gives comprehensive baseline predictions that are sufficiently accurate for the organization of experimental results. The data speak against complex aberrations being formed by the random recombinational repair pathway discussed here.",Excluded,0.9200988

In C57BL/6J beige (bg/bg) mice, with low NK activity, metastasis to the lungs was increased and survival time decreased. In C57BL/6J normal (+/+) mice treatment with PK136, a highly specific monoclonal anti-NK antibody (Ab), caused a depletion of NK cytotoxic activity, as demonstrated using a standard 51Cr release assay. In animals bearing ocular tumors, treatment with PK136 Ab resulted in significantly increased pulmonary metastasis and an altered pattern of metastasis. The effect of combined treatment protocols using LS2616 (linomide) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) was examined in enucleated and unenucleated animals. Treatment with LS2616 and Cy resulted in a significant decrease in mean pulmonary metastases (MPM), a decreased frequency of metastasis to the submandibular lymph nodes and an increase in mean survival time. In enucleated mice this combined treatment protocol resulted in apparent cures, the lowest MPM and the longest survival time observed. When tumor-bearing mice were treated with either silica, carrageenan or sublethal gamma irradiation, no effect on metastasis or survival was observed.

1177,"A review of the effects of uranium and depleted uranium exposure on reproduction and fetal development Depleted uranium (DU) is used in armor-penetrating munitions, military vehicle armor, and aircraft, ship and missile counterweighting/ballasting, as well as in a number of other military and commercial applications. Recent combat applications of DU alloy [i.e., Persian Gulf War (PGW) and Kosovo peacekeeping objective] resulted in human acute exposure to DU dust, vapor or aerosol, as well as chronic exposure from tissue embedding of DU shrapnel fragments. DU alloy is 99.8% 238Uranium, and emits approximately 60% of the alpha, beta, and gamma radiation found in natural uranium (4.05 x 10(-7) Ci/g DU alloy). DU is a heavy metal that is 160% more dense than lead and can remain within the body for many years and slowly solubilize. High levels of urinary uranium have been measured in PGW veterans 10 years after exposure to DU fragments and vapors. In rats, there is strong evidence of DU accumulation in tissues including testes, bone, kidneys, and brain. In vitro tests indicate that DU alloy may be both genotoxic and mutagenic, whereas a recent in vivo study suggests that tissue-embedded DU alloy may be carcinogenic in rats. There is limited available data for reproductive and teratological deficits from exposure to uranium per se, typically from oral, respiratory, or dermal exposure routes. Alternatively, there is no data available on the reproductive effects of DU embedded. This paper reviews published studies of reproductive toxicity in humans and animals from uranium or DU exposure, and discusses ongoing animal research to evaluate reproductive effects in male and female rats embedded with DU fragments, and possible consequences in F1 and F2 generations.",Excluded,0.91965973

Contemporary cancer treatment often includes a combination of radiation therapy with chemotherapy. This may influence the pattern of second cancer in long term survivors. We performed an audit of radiation induced sarcoma seen in the Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma Clinic at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Method(s): Patients were identified through the Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma Clinic at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Patients with a sarcoma diagnosis between June 2005 and June 2010 were identified. Fourteen patients were identified to have radiation induced sarcoma. Result(s): Seven of the patients were female and seven were male. The median age was 54. Of the initial diagnoses, four were sarcoma, five adenocarcinoma. two squamous cell carcinoma, one ependymoma, one melanoma and one lymphoma. The median radiation dose was 50Gy. Five patients received chemotherapy at the time of the initial radiotherapy. The median latency interval for patients who received chemotherapy was 5.1 years, and mean latency interval 5 years. Patients who did not receive chemotherapy had a longer median latency interval of 13.6 years and significantly longer mean latency interval of 13.5 years (p = 0.02).

The authors identified, through the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority medical records, a cohort of 16,329 flight crew and 3,165 air traffic control officers (ATCOs) and assembled data on their occupational and lifestyle exposures. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated to compare cancer incidence in each occupation to that of the general population; internal analyses were conducted by fitting Cox regression models. All-cancer incidence was 20-29% lower in each occupation than in the general population, mainly due to a lower incidence of smoking-related cancers [SIR (95% CI) = 0.33 (0.27-0.38) and 0.42 (0.28-0.60) for flight crew and ATCOs, respectively], consistent with their much lower prevalence of smoking. Skin melanoma rates were increased in both flight crew (SIR = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.45-2.38) and ATCOs (2.66; 1.55-4.25), with rates among the former increasing with increasing number of flight hours (p-trend = 0.02). However, internal analyses revealed no differences in skin melanoma rates between flight crew and ATCOs (hazard ratio: 0.78, 95% CI = 0.37-1.66) and identified skin that burns easily when exposed to sunlight (p = 0.001) and sunbathing to get a tan (p = 0.07) as the strongest risk predictors of skin melanoma in both occupations. The similar site-specific cancer risks between the two occupational groups argue against risks among flight crew being driven by occupation-specific exposures.

572,"Pten regulates Aurora-A and cooperates with Fbxw7 in modulating radiation-induced tumor development The Aurora-A kinase gene is frequently amplified and/or overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, leading to major efforts to develop therapeutic agents targeting this pathway. Here, we show that Aurora-A is targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the F-box protein FBXW7 in a process that is regulated by GSK3beta. Using a series of truncated Aurora-A proteins and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified distinct FBXW7 and GSK3beta-binding sites in Aurora-A. Mutation of critical residues in either site substantially disrupts degradation of Aurora-A. Furthermore, we show that loss of Pten results in the stabilization of Aurora-A by attenuating FBXW7-dependent degradation of Aurora-A through the AKT/GSK3beta pathway. Moreover, radiation-induced tumor latency is significantly shortened in Fbxw7(+/-)Pten(+/-) mice as compared with either Fbxw7(+/-) or Pten(+/-) mice, indicating that Fbxw7 and Pten appear to cooperate in suppressing tumorigenesis.

We wished to ascertain whether a correlation existed between the expression of EGFR, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFalpha) and platelet-derived growth factors A and B (PDGF-A and PDGF-B) and treatment outcome in a group of patients with oropharyngeal cancer who had undergone curative radiation therapy. We also assessed the relationship existing between each of the aforementioned proteins and intratumoral microvessel densities (IMD) which have been previously reported (Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2000;48:17-25. Material(s) and Method(s): Pretherapeutic tumor biopsies from 95 patients were immunohistochemically stained and their immunoreactivities evaluated semi-quantitatively. The statistical analyses included Cox regression for calculating risk ratios of survival endpoints and logistic regression for determining odds ratios for the development of distant metastasis. Result(s): Local tumor control as well as disease-free and overall survival were independent of protein expression levels, whereas combined TGFalpha and EGFR immunoreactivities were closely related to IMD (P=0.003). The expression levels of these two proteins were also correlated to each other (P=0.015). Expression of PDGF-B occurred in 54% of cases and was associated with an increase in the risk of developing distant metastasis (P=0.011). Conclusion(s): Tumoral levels of TGFalpha, EGFR and PDGF-A/B are not predictive of radioresponsiveness in oropharyngeal cancers. The association between IMD and immunoreactivity for TGFalpha and EGFR indicates the involvement of these proteins in the promotion of angiogenesis in these tumors. PDGF-B should be further evaluated as a prognostic marker for squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.89938164

The analysis of uterine content revealed a significant increase in the number of dead implants/female compared with the vehicle control in only those females which were mated with male mice after six weeks of treatment of highest dose level of imidacloprid. The dominant lethal mutations were observed only at spermatogonial stage. Conclusion(s): Long-term exposure of pesticide generated SHAs even at lowest dose level (5.5 mg/kg/day for 14 days) and mutagenic effects at spermatogonial stage at highest dose level (22 mg/kg/day for 28 days).

373,"Proton therapy for atypical meningiomas We report clinical outcomes of proton therapy in patients with World Health Organization grade 2 (atypical) meningiomas. Between 2005 and 2013, 22 patients with atypical meningiomas were treated to a median dose of 63 Gy (RBE) using proton therapy, as an adjuvant therapy after surgery (n = 12) or for recurrence or progression of residual tumor (n = 10). Six patients had presumed radiation-induced meningiomas, but none had received prior radiotherapy for their meningioma. The median follow-up time after radiation was 39 months (range 7-104) and all patients remain alive at last follow-up. The 5-year estimate of local control was 71.1 % (95 % CI 49.3-92.9 %). The 5-year estimate of local control was 87.5 % following a radiation dose >60 Gy (RBE), compared to 50.0 % for <=60 Gy (RBE) (p = 0.038). The 5-year estimate of neuraxis dissemination was 5 % (95 % CI 0-14.6 %) and 6.2 % (95 % CI 0-18.2 %) for metastases outside of the central nervous system. Radiation necrosis was observed in one patient with a history of prior cranial irradiation. Fractionated proton therapy was associated with favorable tumor control rates for grade 2 meningiomas. Prospective studies are needed to define the optimal radiation dose for high-grade meningiomas.Copyright © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded,0.8965066
1224,"Ultrasmall WS2 Quantum Dots with Visible Fluorescence for Protection of Cells and Animal Models from Radiation-Induced Damages Two-dimensional WS2 materials have attracted wide attention in condensed physics and materials science due to its unique geometric and electronic structures. Particularly, WS2 shows extraordinary catalytic activities when its size decreases to ultrasmall, which provides potential opportunities for medical applications. In this work, WS2 quantum dots with strong catalytic properties were used for in vitro and in vivo protection from ionizing radiation induced cell damages. WS2 quantum dots possess unique optical properties of blue photoluminescence emission and excitation-wavelength dependent emission profiles. In vitro studies showed that cell viability can be considerably improved and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be removed by WS2 quantum dots. In vivo studies showed WS2 quantum dots can effectively protect the hematopoietic system and DNA from damages caused by high-energy radiation through removing whole-body excessive ROS. Furthermore, WS2 quantum dots showed nearly 80% renal clearance within 24 h post injection and did not cause any obvious toxicities in up to 30 days after treatment.Copyright © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Excluded,0.8937898
645,"Dna damage and repair: Fruit and vegetable effects in a feeding trial Epidemiologic studies have examined the association between fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption and the risk of cancer. Several cancer-preventive mechanisms have been proposed, such as antioxidant properties and modulation of biotransformation enzyme activities; both may be associated with reducing DNA damage and hence the mutation rate. We investigated, in a randomized, controlled, crossover feeding trial, the effect of 10 servings/day of botanically defined F&V for 2 wk on endogenous DNA damage; resistance to gamma-irradiation damage; and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes, measured by the Comet assay. We also explored the association between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and serum bilirubin concentrations and DNA damage and repair measures. Healthy men (n = 11) and women (n = 17), age 20 to 40 yr, provided blood samples at the end of each feeding period. Overall, F&V did not affect DNA damage and repair measures in lymphocytes. The number of UGT1A1*28 alleles was inversely associated with sensitivity to gamma-irradiation exposure and DNA repair capacity, but a biological mechanism to explain this association is unclear. A larger sample size is needed to investigate the association between bilirubin concentrations and endogenous DNA damage. With inconsistent findings in the literature, additional dietary intervention studies on the effect of F&V on DNA damage and repair are needed.

618,[Stimulation of the suppressor activity in relation to hematopoietic cells in the mouse thymus as affected by pertussis vaccine] After a single intraperitoneal injection of formalinized whole-cell pertussis vaccine 5374 into CBA mice a drastic depletion of cells in the thymus accompanied by the enhancement of suppressor T-cells production is observed. T-cells inhibit the endogenous and exogenous colony-formation in the spleen by hematopoietic stem cells (CFUs). Treatment of thymus cells with the anti-I-Jk alloantiserum against a specific marker of suppressor T-cells in the presence of complement removes the inhibitory effect on CFUs proliferation and has a stimulatory action on the capacity of the marrow CFUs to form macroscopic hematopoietic colonies in the spleen compared with control ones. These results suggest probable involvement of I-J-bearing suppressor T-cells in the hematopoietic disorders induced by pertussis vaccine.,Excluded,0.8715061
279,"Role for the mammalian Swi5-Sfr1 complex in DNA strand break repair through homologous recombination In fission yeast, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays an important role in homologous recombination (HR), a pathway crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Here we identify and characterize mammalian Swi5 and Sfr1 homologues. Mouse Swi5 and Sfr1 are nuclear proteins that form a complex in vivo and in vitro. Swi5 interacts in vitro with Rad51, the DNA strand-exchange protein which functions during HR. By generating Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) embryonic stem cell lines, we found that both proteins are mutually interdependent for their stability. Importantly, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays a role in HR when Rad51 function is perturbed in vivo by expression of a BRC peptide from BRCA2. Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) cells are selectively sensitive to agents that cause DNA strand breaks, in particular ionizing radiation, camptothecin, and the Parp inhibitor olaparib. Consistent with a role in HR, sister chromatid exchange induced by Parp inhibition is attenuated in Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) cells, and chromosome aberrations are increased. Thus, Swi5-Sfr1 is a newly identified complex required for genomic integrity in mammalian cells with a specific role in the repair of DNA strand breaks.",Excluded,0.87127215

Collected data included device model, anatomic location, and treatment beam energies, treatment type, and estimated dose to the device. Patients were treated with either high-energy (16-MV) and/or low-energy (6 MV) photon beams with or without electron beams (6-16 MeV). The devices were interrogated with pre- and post-RT and/or weekly with either in-treatment or home interrogation, depending on the patient's dependence on the device and the estimated or measured delivered dose. Outcomes analyzed were inappropriate ICD therapies, device malfunctions, or device-related clinical events., RESULTS: The PMs were exposed to 84.4 +/- 99.7 cGy of radiation, and the ICDs were exposed to 92.1 +/- 72.6 cGy of radiation. Two patients with ICDs experienced a partial reset of the ICD with the loss of historic diagnostic data after receiving 123 and 4 cGy, respectively. No device malfunction or premature battery depletion was observed at 6-month follow-up from RT completion., CONCLUSIONS: CIED malfunction due to indirect RT exposure is uncommon. Regular in-treatment or home interrogation should be done to detect and treat these events and to ensure that diagnostic data are preserved. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Twelve of 23 patients had surgery as definitive treatment and the tumor recurred locally in all; seven of these 12 patients were subsequently salvaged by further surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy or by radiotherapy alone, with 58% ultimate local control. The remaining three patients had unresectable tumors at diagnosis and received radiation alone, with a local tumor control rate of 33%. Patients were also analyzed according to the extent of surgical resection prior to radiation therapy and according to radiation dose. Eighty-eight percent of completely resected, 50% of partially resected, and 44% of unresected tumors were locally controlled for an overall local control rate of 61%.

742,"Mating competitiveness of sterile male anopheles coluzzii in semi-field cages The renewed interest in the development of control strategies using sterile insects raises hopes of being able to control the disease by cutting down the high reproductive rate of mosquitoes. Specifically, investigations into factors that account for male mating competitiveness are critical to the development of genetic control strategies. In this study, we assessed the effects of partial irradiation with 75 Gy on Anopheles coluzzii sexual competitiveness when allowed to mate in different ratios of sterile/ fertile males for 2 nights in field cages. Moreover, to determine the dynamics of this competition, competitiveness was compared between males allowed 1 night vs 2 nights of contact with females. Sterilized (S) and fertile (U) males between 4 and 6 days of age were released in field cages (1.70mx1.70mx1.70m) with females (F) of similar age and left for 2 nights at the following ratios (S:U:F): (100:0:100) (100:100:100) (300:100:100) (500:100:100) (0:100:100). Each treatment was replicated 3 times. Competitiveness was determined by assessing the hatching rate of eggs laid en masse and the insemination rate, determined by dissecting recaptured females. An additional experiment with a ratio of (500:100:100) has been done with a mating period of either 1 or 2 nights. For the first experiment, the egg hatching rate was significantly affected by the release ratio and we thus observed that the Fried competitiveness index of sterile males was between 0.29 and 0.55. A similar insemination rate was recorded after 2 nights of contact in experiment 1, while significant difference was observed in the (S:U:F) (100:0:100) ratio between the males left to mate for 1 and 2 nights. However, a similar hatching rate was observed when mating occurred for 1 or 2 nights. The results suggest a release ratio of at least 2 sterile males for 1 fertile male and that An. coluzzii mating competitiveness experiments in field cages should be run for 1 instead of 2 nights.",Excluded,0.8461147

Forty million bone marrow cells from male donors were given to female recipients on each of 5 consecutive days, 5 to 10 times the number customarily used in the past. When the recipients were examined 2-13 weeks after the last transfusion, donor cells were found to average 16-25% of total marrow cells. Similar percentages of donor cells were found when variants of the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase determined electrophoretically were used for identification of donor and recipient cells. Evidence is presented that the proportion of donor cells is compatible with a linear dependence on the number of cells transfused over the range tested--i.e., 20-200 million bone marrow cells injected intravenously.

This study examined the incidence rates of cancer cases (averages for 2006-2010) and relationships with environmental radioactivity levels. Soil and water samples were collected from provincial and district centers of Van city and the outdoor gamma doses were determined using a portable gamma scintillation detector. Gross alpha and beta, (226)Ra, (232)Th, and (40)K activities were measured in both tap water and soil samples. Although high rates of stomach and esophagus cancers have been reported previously in Van the underlying reasons have not hitherto been defined. Incidences of cancers were highest in the Gurpinar (326.0) and Ozalp (377.1) counties (p<0.001). As to the results of the gross alpha and gross beta radioactivity measurements in the drinking water, these two counties also had high beta radionuclide levels: Gurpinar (140 mBq/dm3) and Ozalp (206 mBq/dm3). Even if within the normal range, a relation between the higher rate of the incidence of stomach and esophagus cancers with that of the higher rate of beta radionuclide activity was clear. On Spearman correlation analysis, the relation between higher beta radionuclide levels and cancer incidence was found to be statistically significant (p<0.01). According to the results of the analysis, Van residents receive an average 1.86 mSv/y annual dose from outdoor gamma radiation, ingestion of radionuclides in the drinking water, and indoor 222Rn activity.

RP events were retrospectively scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to identify clinical variables and genotypes associated with risk of RP of grades >=2 and >=3 on univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively. P values were corrected for multiple hypothesis esting., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 21.4 months, the incidence of grade >=2 RP was 29% and grade >=3 RP was 14%. On multivariate analysis, after adjusting for clinical factors such as concurrent chemotherapy and consolidation docetaxel, and lung dosimetric parameters such as volume receiving greater than 20 Gy and mean lung dose, MTHFR genotype (rs1801131; AA versus AC/CC) was significantly associated with risk of grade >=2 RP (hazard ratio: 0.37; 95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.76; P = .006, corrected P = .018) and grade >=3 RP (hazard ratio: 0.21; 95% confidence interval: 0.06-0.70; P = .01; corrected P = .03).

The association between indoor radon exposure and lung cancer was studied in 427 municipalities. NRPB detectors were sent to 10,000 households, and 7,500 of the detectors were returned. Data from a nation-wide survey of smoking habits in 1964-1965 were available. Data on asbestos exposure were also used in a regression analysis. The reporting to the Cancer Registry of all new cases of cancer is fairly complete, as hospital departments and institutes of pathology are obliged to report all cancer cases. The histologically confirmed lung cancer cases were grouped into squamous-cell carcinoma, small-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and other or non-specified histological types. The age-adjusted rate of lung cancer by histological type was the dependent variable in the regression analysis. A consistent increase in incidence of lung cancer was seen with increasing tobacco consumption, but no positive trend could be shown with increasing radon exposure in the descriptive presentation of the data. In the regression analysis, however, the incidence of small-cell anaplastic lung tumors in females increased significantly with increasing radon exposure.

The current standard or RT among HIV-positive cancer patients who are immuno-compromised does not differ from that of HIV-negative ones., OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of radiation therapy on immunological and virological status among HIV-infected cancer patients., MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective observational study was conducted of HIV-infected cancer patients who received definitive RT in seven hospitals in Thailand. Blood samples were taken to determine immune status using CD4%, and virological status was identified using plasma HIV-RNA viral load (HIV-VL) assay: at baseline before RT at the last week of RT completion; and at the 6-month follow-up visit. Additional CD4% test was performed at the 3-month follow-up visit., RESULTS: Ninety HIV-infected cancer patients from seven hospitals in Thailand were included in the analysis. The median age was 40 years old (range 19-61). Seventy-six patients (84.4%) were female and 65 (72.2%) were cases of invasive cervical cancers. Eighty-seven percent of patients had been receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) before RT The mean CD4% at baseline, RT completion, 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits, were 18.7%, 20.1%, 16.8% and 17.1%, respectively.

Exclusion criteria included doses of radiotherapy <30 or >80 Gy, or dose per fraction >200 or <180 cGy. Recursive partitioning analysis and spline models were used to select dose thresholds. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to validate thresholds with respect to overall survival., RESULTS: Recursive partitioning analysis models defined a threshold of 57 Gy for stage I/II Merkel cell carcinoma, above which 3-year overall survival rate was decreased (P < 0.0001). The 3-year overall survival rate for patients receiving 50.0-57.0 Gy (81.2%) was greater compared to doses of 30.0-49.9 Gy (75.3%) or >57.0 Gy (70%, P < 0.0001). Doses > 57.0 Gy were associated with an increased hazard of death (1.31, confidence interval 1.07-1.60) with respect to doses of 50.0-57.0 Gy.

As of 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified 415 known or suspected carcinogens. Cancer arises through an extremely complicated web of multiple causes, and we will likely never know the full range of agents or combinations of agents. We do know that preventing exposure to individual carcinogens prevents the disease. Declines in cancer rates-such as the drop in male lung cancer cases from the reduction in tobacco smoking or the drop in bladder cancer among cohorts of dye workers from the elimination of exposure to specific aromatic amines-provides evidence that preventing cancer is possible when we act on what we know. Although the overall age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in the United States among both men and women have declined in the last decade, the rates of several types of cancers are on the rise; some of which are linked to environmental and occupational exposures. This report chronicles the most recent epidemiologic evidence linking occupational and environmental exposures with cancer. Peer-reviewed scientific studies published from January 2005 to June 2007 were reviewed, supplementing our state-of-the-evidence report published in September 2005. Despite weaknesses in certain individual studies, we consider the evidence linking the increased risk of several types of cancer with specific exposures somewhat strengthened by recent publications, among them brain cancer from exposure to non-ionizing radiation, particularly radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile telephones; breast cancer from exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) before puberty; leukemia from exposure to 1,3-butadiene; lung cancer from exposure to air pollution; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) from exposure to pesticides and solvents; and prostate cancer from exposure to pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metal working fluids or mineral oils. In addition to NHL and prostate cancer, early findings from the National Institutes of Health Agricultural Health Study suggest that several additional cancers may be linked to a variety of pesticides. Our report also briefly describes the toxicological evidence related to the carcinogenic effect of specific chemicals and mechanisms that are difficult to study in humans, namely exposures to bis-phenol A and epigenetic, trans-generational effects. To underscore the multi-factorial, multi-stage nature of cancer, we also present a technical description of cancer causation summarizing current knowledge in molecular biology. We argue for a new cancer prevention paradigm, one based on an understanding that cancer is ultimately caused by multiple interacting factors rather than a paradigm based on dubious attributable fractions. This new cancer prevention paradigm demands that we limit exposure to avoidable environmental and occupational carcinogens, in combination with additional important risk factors like diet and lifestyle. The research literature related to environmental and occupational causes of cancer is constantly growing, and future updates will be carried out in light of new biological understanding of the mechanisms and new methods for studying exposures in human populations. The current state of knowledge is sufficient to compel us to act on what we know.

39,"A comparison of normal tissue complication probability of brain for proton and photon therapy of canine nasal tumors This study compared the calculated normal tissue complication probability of brain in dogs with a nasal tumor, which had both photon and proton treatment planning. Nine dogs diagnosed with a variety of histologies, but all with large, caudally located nasal tumors were studied. Three-dimensional (3-D) photon dose distribution, and a proton dose distribution was calculated for each dog. To calculate the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for brain, the partial brain volume irradiated with the prescribed dose was determined, then a mathematic model relating complications to partial volume and radiation dose was used. The NTCP was always smaller for proton plans as compared to photon plans, indicating conformation of the dose to the target allows a higher dose to be given. If a 5% NTCP were accepted, the mean applicable dose for this group of dogs was 50.2 Gy for photons, but 58.3 Gy for protons. Not all dogs would benefit the same from proton irradiation. If a large partial brain volume has to be irradiated, the advantage becomes minimal. There is also a minimal advantage if the planning target volume (PTV) includes a small, superficial brain volume. However, for a complex PTV shape the degree of conformation is clearly superior for protons and results in smaller calculated NTCPs.",Excluded,0.70102173

Although a significant difference between mean tritiated thymidine uptake was observed in the lymphocyte response to phytohaemagglutinin (cancer patients 1859 cpm, control 2502 cpm), this could be explained by an unexpectedly prolonged effect of radiotherapy. Mean counts for those twenty-six cancer patients receiving radiotherapy within the period 18 months to 4 years were low (1257 cpm), but were normal (2366 cpm) for the remainder. A significant negative correlation of lymphocyte transformation with age was confirmed in both groups. There was no significant difference in cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity response to commonly encountered antigens. Whilst recognising that these tests do not comprehensively assess immune function, the present results provide no support for the theory that an age-related decline in immune function contributes to the heightened incidence of cancer in the elderly.",Excluded,0.6918833
226,"In vitro activation of the in vivo colony-forming units of the mouse yolk sac Experiments were performed to investigate the presence of colony-forming units (CFU) in the mouse embryonic yolk sac during the developmental period in which the yolk sac is the sole hemopoietic organ. Injection of yolk sac cell suspensions from normal embryos into syngeneic, lethally irradiated adult recipients evoked a very low number of spleen colonies. However, prior cultivation of yolk sacs in vitro caused a dramatic increase in the spleen colony-forming capacity--as high as 84-fold--following 48 hours in culture. The yolk sac origin of the spleen colonies was confirmed by: (a) Chromosomal marker analysis; (b) dose-response analysis; (c) demonstrating that the above colonies were not of endogenous origin induced by the mere injection of grafted cells. We conclude that the yolk sac contains many precursors of colony-forming cells which though undetectable by immediate grafting apparently become activated in culture by an as yet unknown induction process.",Excluded,0.6870496
1194,"The treatment of recurrence following fast neutron therapy for head and neck malignancy Twenty-eight patients received fast neutron therapy for head and neck malignancy. Of these, seven had no recurrence, 13 had a recurrence at the primary site, five had a recurrence in the neck and three had a recurrence in the neck and at the primary site. Treatment of a primary site recurrence was difficult with seven of the eight patients submitted for major surgical resection developing serious complications. Of the six patients developing a fistula four required flap repair. The tumour specific 5-year survival for the whole group of 28 patients was 29%. The surgical treatment of locoregional recurrence following fast neutron therapy is fraught with problems and some type of flap repair is usually necessary.",Excluded,0.68465793
866,"Bone Marrow Transplantation Induces Normoglycemia in a Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Murine Model Objective: To study the cellular mechanisms involved in the regression of diabetic nephropathy, bone marrow-derived cells must be identified. The aim of this study was to obtain a diabetic chimeric model with bone marrow cells expressing enhanced green fluorecence protein (EGFP), without modifying the course of diabetic nephropathy. Material(s) and Method(s): Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed in an obese type 2 diabetic murine model (db/db) owing to a mutation in the leptin receptor gene. Whole bone marrow from female donor C57BL/6 EGFP+ mice was transplanted into 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice and into 8- and 24-week-old female C57BLKS (db/db) EGFP- mice. Recipient mice received total body irradiation (TBI) followed by bone marrow (BM) cell infusion. We tested various irradiation doses (Gy) and numbers of BM cells. Result(s): When a low TBI dose and a small number of BM cells were administered, only syngeneic C57BL/6 mice became chimeric, whereas allogeneic db/db mice showed rejection. When Gy dose and BM cells were increased, db/db mice became chimeric. However, 8-week-old db/db mice lost the obese phenotype and became normoglycemic, probably due to peripheral BM cell infiltration. Conversely, 24-week-old db/db mice remained obese showing similar blood glucose values, body weights, albuminuria, and glomerular lesions at nontransplanted db/db mice. Conclusion(s): Recipient age greatly influenced the peripheral repopulation after BMT in db/db mice. Only the adult chimeric db/db mice seemed to be a good model to study the cellular mechanisms involved in the regression of diabetic nephropathy. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

1037,"An essential role for Drosophila hus1 in somatic and meiotic DNA damage responses The checkpoint proteins Rad9, Rad1 and Hus1 form a clamp-like complex which plays a central role in the DNA-damage-induced checkpoint response. Here we address the function of the 9-1-1 complex in Drosophila. We decided to focus our analysis on the meiotic and somatic requirements of hus1. For that purpose, we created a null allele of hus1 by imprecise excision of a P element found 2 kb from the 3' of the hus1 gene. We found that hus1 mutant flies are viable, but the females are sterile. We determined that hus1 mutant flies are sensitive to hydroxyurea and methyl methanesulfonate but not to X-rays, suggesting that hus1 is required for the activation of an S-phase checkpoint. We also found that hus1 is not required for the G2-M checkpoint and for post-irradiation induction of apoptosis. We subsequently studied the role of hus1 in activation of the meiotic checkpoint and found that the hus1 mutation suppresses the dorsal-ventral pattering defects caused by mutants in DNA repair enzymes. Interestingly, we found that the hus1 mutant exhibits similar oocyte nuclear defects as those produced by mutations in DNA repair enzymes. These results demonstrate that hus1 is essential for the activation of the meiotic checkpoint and that hus1 is also required for the organization of the oocyte DNA, a function that might be independent of the meiotic checkpoint.",Excluded,0.6472954
265,"Diagnostic Radiation Exposure in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Background: Because of the chronic and relapsing nature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which often requires characterization with CT scan, IBD patients might be exposed to a large amount of radiation. As a cumulative effective dose (CED) >= 100 mSv is considered significant for stochastic risks of cancer, it is important to monitor and control the radiation exposure of the IBD patients. In the present work, we aimed to quantify the mean CED in IBD patients to assess any harmful effects of radiation., Methods: This study includes 200 IBD patients, identified retrospectively, from the outpatient clinics of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal between January 1, 2010, and February 15, 2017, from the gastroenterologists' patients lists. The number and type of each radiology test performed were listed for each patient during the study period and the CED was calculated using our institution's dose index when available and standardized tables., Results: Among the 200 IBD patients, 157 patients had Crohn's disease (CD), 41 had ulcerative colitis (UC), and 2 had indeterminate colitis. The mean CED for IBD patients was 23.1 +/- 45.2 mSv during a mean follow-up duration of 4.3 years. CED was higher among patients with CD than with UC (27.5 +/- 49.5 versus 6.8 +/- 14.8 mSv; p<0.01). Six patients were exposed to a high CED (>100 mSv) and all had CD., Conclusion: While potentially harmful levels of radiation exposure are of concern in only a small number of patients, strategies to limit such exposure are encouraged when clinically appropriate.",Excluded,0.6416119
940,"Ionising radiation and cabin crew concerns The trend in flying at higher altitudes and latitudes results in increased exposure to cosmic radiation. The biological incidence of highest energy particles and heavy ions is not well documented. Crew members flying transpolar routes are already exposed to levels of about 6 mSv.y<sup>-1</sup>, and are expected to exceed this level in a number of cases. Epidemiological studies are important in risk assessment. Organisation of monitoring campaigns, aircrew information, solar flares and related high levels of exposures, pregnancy related issues, medical control, recognition of occupational exposure during illness, including cancer cases, and social protection, are also major concerns.",Excluded,0.6086389
543,"In vivo UHMWPE biodegradation of retrieved prosthesis Sixty-two ultra high molecular weight polyethylene prosthetic components (PEs) (31 tibial plateaux and 31 cups), sterilised by gamma rays or ethylene oxide (EtO), were retrieved after 1-12 years depending on different medical reasons and were studied by FTIR spectroscopy with derivatisation of oxidised species. Esters, acids and hydroperoxides were found under the surface of the EtO sterilised PEs up to 2 mm depth. The behaviour of gamma ray sterilised PEs is more complex due to the oxidation following the sterilisation process. Ester and acid formation might arise from the diffusion of components of synovial liquid or from the oxidation process, whereas hydroperoxide formation is thought to be due to the oxidation. Abrasion and delamination process is discussed considering the topological distribution of degradation products.",Excluded,0.607177
594,"Myocardial infarction mortality risk after treatment for hodgkin disease: A collaborative British cohort study Background Myocardial infarction is a major cause of excess long-term mortality in survivors of Hodgkin disease, but limited information exists on the effects of specific chemotherapy regimens used to treat these patients on their risk of death from myocardial infarction. Methods We followed a cohort of 7033 Hodgkin disease patients who were treated in Britain from November 1, 1967, through September 30, 2000, and compared their risk of myocardial infarction mortality with that in the general population of England and Wales. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results A total of 166 deaths from myocardial infarction occurred in the cohort, statistically significantly more than expected(standardized mortality ratio[SMR] = 2.5, 95% confidence interval[CI] = 2.1 to 2.9), with an absolute excess risk of 125.8 per 100000 person-years. Standardized mortality ratios decreased sharply with older age at first treatment, but absolute excess risks of death from myocardial infarction increased with older age up to age 65 years at first treatment. The statistically significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction mortality persisted through to 25 years after first treatment. Risks were increased statistically significantly and independently for patients who had been treated with supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy, anthracyclines, or vincristine. Risk was particularly high for patients treated with the doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine regimen(SMR = 9.5, 95% CI = 3.5 to 20.6). Risk at 20 or more years after first treatment was particularly great for patients who had received supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy and vincristine without anthracylines(SMR = 14.8, 95% CI = 4.8 to 34.5). Conclusions The risk of death from myocardial infarction after treatment for Hodgkin disease remains high for at least 25 years. The increased risks are related to supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy but may also be related to anthracycline and vincristine treatment.",Excluded,0.6041239

In multivariate analysis, significant factors for recurrence were age (p = 0.0197), tumour size 2 cm or greater (p = 0.0095), immunosuppression (p = 0.0082), and treatment modality (p = 0.0009). © 2014 Multimed Inc.",Excluded,0.60089713
64,"Radon, smoking and HPV as lung cancer risk factors in ecological studies OBJECTIVES: Cohen's ecological analyses revealed negative correlation between the lung cancer mortality and average indoor radon concentration in the US counties, that contradicts to linear non-threshold (LNT) model and is inconsistent with results of case-control studies. The aim of this study was to analyze dependence between radon exposure and lung cancer mortality rate taking into account more complete data on smoking and new findings on association of the lung cancer with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on the cancer rates in the US counties and Russian oblasts, smoking prevalence and indoor radon concentration was found in literature. The cervix cancer incidence rate was used as surrogate of the HPV infection prevalence. The analysis included calculation of the coefficients of linear dependence between radon exposure and lung cancer mortality rate with adjustment to smoking and HPV infection prevalence., RESULTS: After adjustment for the most relevant data on smoking and HPV infection, correlation between the lung cancer mortality and indoor radon was found to be consistent with results of the case control studies., CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of geographically aggregated data on the lung cancer mortality and radon concentration in dwellings with adjustment to the significant risk factors confirms both the linear non-threshold dependency and results obtained in studies with individual accounting for the smoking and radon.",Excluded,0.5880314
