2463,"Rapid detection of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes and hematopoietic progenitor cells by mFISH. Structural chromosome aberrations (SCAs) are sensitive indicators of a preceding exposure of the hematopoietic system to ionizing radiation. Cytogenetic investigations have therefore become routine tools for an assessment of absorbed radiation doses and their biological effects after occupational exposure or radiation accidents.Due to its speed and ease of use, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole chromosome painting (WCP) probes has become a method of choice to visualize SCAs. Until recently, this technique was limited to a rather small number of chromosomes, which could be tested simultaneously. As a result, only a fraction of the structural aberrations present in a sample could be detected and the overall dose effect had to be calculated by extrapolation. The recent introduction of two genome-wide screening techniques in tumor research, i.e., Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) and multicolor FISH (mFISH) now allows the detection of translocations involving any two non-homologous chromosomes.The present study was prompted by our desire to bring the power of mFISH to bear for the rapid identification of radiation-induced SCAs. We chose two model systems to investigate the utility of mFISH: lymphocytes that were exposed in vitro to 3 Gy photons and single hematopoietic progenitor cell colonies isolated from a Chernobyl victim 9 years after in vivo exposure to 5.4 Sv.In lymphocytes, we found up to 15 different chromosomes involved in rearrangements indicating complex radiation effects. Stable aberrations detected in hematopoietic cell colonies, on the other hand, showed involvement of up to three different chromosomes. These results demonstrated that mFISH is a rapid and powerful approach to detect and characterize radiation-induced SCAs in the hemopoietic system. The application of mFISH is expected to result in a more detailed and, thus, more informative picture of radiation effects. Eventually, this technique will allow researchers to rapidly delineate chromosomal breakpoints and facilitate the identification of the genes involved in radiation tumorigenesis.

2481,"INTRAOPERATIVE CHOLANGIOGRAPHY DURING CHOLECYSTECTOMY RESULTS IN LOW EXPOSURE TO RADIATION: A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. This study aimed to determine the exposure to radiation delivered to the patient during routine intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) in cholecystectomy and examine the factors affecting radiation dose and fluoroscopy time (FT). From January 2016 to December 2017, 598 IOC examinations were performed. This study included 324 intraoperative cholangiographies performed with c-arm equipment not exceeding 10 years of age. When residents performed the procedures, the mean kerma area product (KAP) was 0.36 (standard deviation [SD] 0.70) Gycm 2 and in specialist surgeons group 0.36 (SD 0.47) Gycm2, P = 0.47. In residents group, the mean FT was 11.4 (SD 10.1) seconds and in specialist surgeons group, 9.2 (SD 11.9) seconds, P < 0.01. Linear regression analysis showed association between increased KAP-values and the presence of common bile duct (CBD) stones and body mass index (BMI). Age, BMI, laparoscopic surgery, acute cholecystitis, presence of CBD stones, resident surgeon performing IOC and ASA III-IV were associated with higher FT. National diagnostic reference level for IOC has not been introduced in Finland so far. Our mean KAP values (0.36 Gycm2) were 3-4 times lower and FT (10.1 seconds) were 3-5 times lower than the few reported in the literature. Routine use of IOC during cholecystectomy results in relatively low-radiation dose performed either by residents or specialist surgeons, irrespective of whether CBD stones were visualized or not.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

The purpose this study was to assess survival rates, clinical outcomes, and radiographic outcomes of total hip arthroplasty in Down syndrome patients. We reviewed 26 total hip arthroplasties (21 patients) performed by four experienced hip surgeons. These patients had a mean age of 35 years and a mean follow-up of 106. months. Clinical outcomes were assessed using Harris Hip scores, and radiographic evaluation for component fixation and migration was performed. The overall survival with aseptic failure as an endpoint was 85%. The mean Harris Hip score improved to 84 points at final follow-up.

2484,"Individual 3D-printed fixation masks for radiotherapy: first clinical experiences. Purpose: To show the feasibility of 3D-printed fixation masks for whole brain radiation therapy in a clinical setting and perform a first comparison to an established thermoplastic mask system. Method(s): Six patients were irradiated with whole brain radiotherapy using individually 3D-printed masks. Daily image guidance and position correction were performed prior to each irradiation fraction. The vectors of the daily position correction were compared to two collectives of patients, who were irradiated using the standard thermoplastic mask system (one cohort with head masks; one cohort with head and neck masks). Result(s): The mean systematic errors in the experimental cohort ranged between 0.59 and 2.10 mm which is in a comparable range to the control groups (0.18 mm-0.68 mm and 0.34 mm-2.96 mm, respectively). The 3D-printed masks seem to be an alternative to the established thermoplastic mask systems. Nevertheless, further investigation will need to be performed. Conclusion(s): The prevailing study showed a reliable and reproducible interfractional positioning accuracy using individually 3D-printed masks for whole brain irradiation in a clinical routine. Further investigations, especially concerning smaller target volumes or other areas of the body, need to be performed before using the system on a larger basis.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.039206672
2485,"Real-time cerebral angiography: Sensitivity of a new contrast-specific ultrasound technique. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To test a new contrast-specific sonography imaging method that offers visualization of the intracranial vasculature in a manner similar to that seen on angiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients (35 sonography studies total) were included in the study after they provided written informed consent. The patients were scanned through the temporal bone window from both sides after intravenous injection of an ultrasound contrast agent (UCA; perflexane lipid microspheres [Imagent]). The goal was to visualize the intracranial arteries, including the middle (M1-M3), anterior (A1 and A2), and posterior (P1-P3) cerebral arteries, using an axial scanning plane. The studies were performed using a contrast-specific imaging mode, based on a phase inversion technique (transcranial ultrasound angiography [tUSA]). For sensitivity, the results were compared with x-ray angiography as the ""gold standard."" For interobserver reliability, 24 of 35 sonography studies were evaluated by 2 physicians with little training in transcranial sonography and by a seasoned sonographer. RESULT(S): The sensitivity of tUSA ranged between 0.778 (95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.577-0.914) and 0.963 (95% CI of 0.810-0.999). The sensitivities were similar among physicians with little training in transcranial sonography and the seasoned sonographer, indicating high inter-rater reliability. Overall, tUSA provided high anatomic resolution and vascular delineation even of small vessels in the millimeter range. At peak intensity, no UCA-related artifacts were observed. CONCLUSION(S): tUSA provides images of the intracranial arteries similar to those obtained at angiography with high anatomic resolution, reasonable sensitivity, and interobserver reliability.",Excluded,0.038336094
2486,"Incidence and nature of tumors induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by gamma-irradiation. In our previous studies carried out on inbred rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain (L. Gross and Y. Dreyfuss, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76: 5910-5913, 1979), the tumor incidence was increased following irradiation (150 rads, 5 times, at weekly intervals), from 22 to 93% in females and from 5 to 59% in males. Experiments here reported suggest that 2 consecutive total-body gamma-irradiations of 150 rads each are sufficient to induce in rats the development of tumors, some malignant; 18 of 19 females (94.7%) developed tumors at an average age of 11.4 mo, and seven of the 14 males in this group (50%) developed tumors at an average age of 10.4 mo. In the second group, which received 3 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 20 of 23 females (86.9%) and 5 of 13 males (38.4%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.1 and 7.5 mo, respectively. In the third group, among rats which received 4 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 17 of 19 females (89.4%) and 4 of 12 males (33.3%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.4 and 10.5 mo, respectively. The etiology of tumors either developing spontaneously or induced by irradiation in rats remains to be clarified. Our attempts to detect virus particles by electron microscopy in such tumors or lymphomas have not been successful. As a working hypothesis, we are tempted to theorize that tumors or lymphomas developing spontaneously or induced by gamma irradiation in rats are caused by latent viral agents which are integrated into the cell genome and are cell associated, i.e., not separable from the rat tumor cells by conventional methods thus far used.",Included,0.970754
2487,"Carcinogenic Interactions between a Single Inhalation of 239PuO2 and Chronic Exposure to Cigarette Smoke in Rats. Rats were exposed once by inhalation to plutonium-239 dioxide ( 239PuO22), resulting in chronic alpha-particle irradiation of the lung, and exposed chronically to cigarette smoke to examine carcinogenic interactions between the two exposures. F344 rats were exposed to 239PuO22 to achieve an initial lung burden of 0.5 kBq and then exposed 6 h/day, 5 days/week to cigarette smoke at 100 or 250 mg particulate matter/m3 for up to 30 months. Exposure to cigarette smoke increased the cumulative radiation dose to lung by slowing the clearance of 239PuO2. 239PuO2 alone did not affect survival, but the higher cigarette smoke exposure shortened survival in females. Combined exposure to 239PuO2 and cigarette smoke acted synergistically to shorten survival in both genders. The combined effects of cigarette smoke and 239PuO2 were approximately additive for lung hyperplasia and adenomas but were strongly synergistic for carcinomas. Differences between observed incidences and incidences predicted by survival-adjusted models accounting for increased radiation dose revealed a substantial component of synergy for carcinomas above that attributable to the radiation dose effect. The synergy for malignant lung tumors is consistent with findings from uranium miners and nuclear weapons production workers. These results bolster confidence in the epidemiological findings and have implications for risk assessment. © 2010 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.9678517
2488,"p53 expression, Ki-67 status, and cell density have no prognostic significance in glioblastomas treated with radio-chemotherapy. Purpose: To identify subgroups in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with different susceptibilities to radio-chemotherapy by p53 protein and Ki-67 expression. Patients and Methods: Thirty-one patients with primary GBM underwent a combined radio-chemotherapy with topotecan. Percentage of cells expressing p53 protein and Ki-67 antigen was determined immunohistochemically. Additionally, the cell density within the tumour tissue was measured. Result(s): Median percentages of p53 and Ki-67 expressing cells were 4.3% (range = 0-28%) and 12.0% (range = 0-28%), respectively. Dividing the cases into two groups by high or low p53 protein 1-year disease-free survival rates were 13.3% and 23.6%. High or low Ki-67 expression showed one-year disease-free survival rates of 18.8% and 17.1%. Neither p53 nor Ki-67 expression showed a significant correlation with disease-free survival or overall survival. Median cell density was 252 cell/field (range = 42-595). 1-year disease-free survival rates were 14.5% and 21.7% in high and low cell density group, respectively. A significant correlation with progression-free survival was observed, whereas the stratification into two groups revealed no significance. Cell density showed a significant inverse correlation with p53 and Ki-67 immunopositivity.

2490,"Assessment of glenoid inclination on routine clinical radiographs and computed tomography examinations of the shoulder. Background: Accurate assessment of glenoid inclination is of interest for a variety of conditions and procedures. The purpose of this study was to develop an accurate and reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on standardized anterior-posterior (AP) radiographs and on computed tomography (CT) images. Material(s) and Method(s): Three consistently identifiable angles were defined: Angle alpha by line AB connecting the superior and inferior glenoid tubercle (glenoid fossa) and the line identifying the scapular spine; angle beta by line AB and the floor of the supraspinatus fossa; angle gamma by line AB and the lateral margin of the scapula. Experimental study: these 3 angles were measured in function of the scapular position to test their resistance to rotation. Conventional AP radiographs and CT scans were acquired in extension/flexion and internal/external rotation in a range up to +/-40degree. Clinical study: the inter-rater reliability of all angles was assessed on AP radiographs and CT scans of 60 patients (30 with proximal humeral fractures, 30 with osteoarthritis) by 2 independent observers. Result(s): The experimental study showed that angle alpha and beta have a resistance to rotation of up to +/-20degree. The deviation from neutral position was not more than +/-10degree. The results for the inter-rater reliability analyzed by Bland-Altman plots for the angle beta fracture group were (mean +/- standard deviation) -0.1 +/- 4.2 for radiographs and -0.3 +/- 3.3 for CT scans; and for the osteoarthritis group were -1.2 +/- 3.8 for radiographs and -3.0 +/- 3.6 for CT scans. Conclusion(s): Angle beta is the most reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on conventional AP radiographs, providing a resistance to positional variability of the scapula and a good inter-rater reliability. © 2012 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.",Excluded,0.03851006
2491,"Effectiveness of marine protected areas for top predators along the central West African and US west coasts. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a popular tool to manage marine resources, but determining the effectiveness of boundaries and management strategies is critical for effective conservation, particularly as MPAs are increasingly being used in ecosystem-based management and marine spatial planning processes. Similarly, satellite telemetry has been heralded as a powerful tool in marine conservation and I apply satellite telemetry to determine MPA effectiveness using two case studies. In the first chapter, I use telemetry to determine the nesting ecology of olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) in Gabon, Africa. Applying a state-space model to filter and determine animal behavior (n = 18), I found that olive ridleys distributions were confined to a small area; renesting events often occurred within 10 km of the original nest, and they were most frequently found within 30 km of the original nesting site between nests. The findings of this study are in keeping with those of olive ridleys studied in other parts of the world, but represent the first comprehensive study of this species in the Eastern Atlantic. Additionally, movements of this species during the internesting period suggest that because of their limited internesting movements, relatively small marine protected areas can be effectively used to protect this species during a critical life stage. In the second chapter, I examine how olive ridleys (n = 18) use the boundaries of Mayumba National Park (MNP) in Gabon, which was created in part to protect them during the interesting period. By applying home range analyses and a predictive habitat model, I found that the boundaries of MNP incorporate only between 55.6 and 81.4 percent of high-use areas, but that if the park was expanded to include the proposed Transboundary Park (TBP) between Gabon and the Republic of Congo, between 97.3 and 100.0 percent of high-use areas would be protected. We found that the driving factors for habitat preference during the interesting period include sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentrations, depth, distance to coast and distance to nesting site. This model can be applied to other nesting sites along the African coast. Overall we found that satellite telemetry was an effective tool for delineating effective boundaries and management strategies of an MPA, and we support the designation of the TBP. In the third chapter, I shift focus to the West Coast of the US and the distribution of top predators in relation to the National Marine Sanctuaries which are among the largest MPAs in the US. By examining home ranges of individual species (blue whales (Balaenoptero musculus) (n = 51), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (n = 15), California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) (n = 111), Laysan albatrosses (Phoebastria immutabilis) (n = 33), black-footed albatrosses (Phoebastria nigripes) (n = 72), and sooty shearwaters ( Puffinus griseus) (n = 25)), I determine that the Sanctuaries incorporate significant levels of high-use areas for humpback whales, blue whales and male California sea lions, but less so for female California sea lions, black-footed albatrosses and sooty shearwaters. No high-use areas for Laysan albatrosses were found within the Sanctuaries. Top predator distribution changed considerably between years and biological seasons, with animals using the Sanctuaries in greater abundance during foraging seasons, and during cooler or more 'normal' oceanographic years. During warmer oceanographic years, animals distributed further offshore, as well as further north as foraging effort likely increased during these years. The Sanctuaries did not encompass these wider ranges during anomalously warm years, indicating a need for wider boundaries if animals are to be protected from interannual and global scale oceanographic variability. In the fourth chapter, I examine the distribution of these same top predators in relation to the entire West Coast of the US as it relates to the California Current System. Again applying home range analyses, I determined high-den ity and high-use multi-species areas across years and oceanographic seasons. The upwelling and Davidson seasons had the largest density of top predators and the National Marine Sanctuaries encompassed a number of high-use and high-density areas, but we also identified under-protected areas. These areas include south of Cape Blanco and Cape Mendocino, between the Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries and offshore of Central California. These regions are unique oceanographic regions that result in increased productivity that is persistent across years, making them prime candidates for additional protected areas or areas that should receive special consideration in the marine spatial planning process. Overall, I was able to show that satellite telemetry can be an effective tool in determining both effectiveness of current MPA boundaries, and in helping to determine where additional protected areas should be considered. Though an expensive conservation tool compared to other types of behavioral studies, when used appropriately, it can help to significantly guide and streamline marine resource management.

2492,"[Prospective double-blind study of prophylaxis of radioxerostomia with Coumarin/Troxerutine in patients with head and neck cancer]. AIM: Prospective, randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study to prove the efficacy of Coumarin/Troxerutine (Venalot Depot) for protection of salivary glands during a head and neck irradiation., PATIENTS AND METHOD: Forty-eight radiotherapy patients (60 Gy) with head and neck cancer were included in this trial. During radiotherapy the salivary glands were located in the core irradiation field. Primary efficacy parameters were sialometry, quantitative salivary gland scintigraphy and clinical evaluation of early effects of radiotherapy (RTOG-score, Table 1). All data were collected at 6 assessments: 1 week pre-radiation (U1), at start (U2), half time (U3) and end (U4) of irradiation, 8 days (U5) and 28 days (U6) after the end of irradiation (Figure 1)., RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (11 verum, 12 placebo) completed the study with all assessments. Sialometrically, all patients were severely (half of radiotherapy) or completely (end of radiotherapy) xerostomatic (Figure 2). In a global efficacy measure according to O'Brien combining scintigraphy and RTOG there was a tendency for a higher efficacy of verum compared to placebo (p = 0.068). After start of irradiation therapy, the RTOG-score showed continuously and significantly lower early radiation effects under verum than under placebo (U3 vs U6: p < 0.05, area under curve: p = 0.032; Table 2, Figure 3). The scintigraphically determined excretion fraction was slightly less impaired in the verum group compared to the placebo treatment (p = 0.12. Figure 4). There was no difference in drug safety between placebo and verum for adverse events, changes in the activity of liver enzymes and for global impression of tolerability., CONCLUSIONS: The results give support for an advantageous effect of Venalot Depot in the treatment of radiogenic sialadenitis and mucositis. In even a small number of evaluable patients, early clinical effects of irradiation (RTOG-score) were less pronounced in the active treatment group than in the placebo group, but the sample size was too low to prove statistically also the benefit of coumarin/troxerutine with the scintigraphic method.

BACKGROUND: The use of cardiac computed tomography (CT) in the evaluation of adult congenital heart disease patients is limited due to concerns of high radiation doses. The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess whether low radiation dose cardiac CT is feasible to evaluate ventricular systolic function in adults with congenital heart disease., METHODS: The study group included 30 consecutive patients with significant congenital heart disease who underwent a total of 35 ECG-gated cardiac CT scans utilizing a 320-detector row CT scanner. Each study included a non-contrast scan and subsequent contrast-enhanced retrospectively-gated acquisition. Effective radiation dose was estimated by multiplying the dose length product by a k-factor of 0.014mSv/mGycm., RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 34.4+/-8.9years, 60% were men, and mean body mass index was 24.2+/-4.3kg/m2. A majority of patients (n=28, 93.3%) had contraindications to cardiac MRI. A tube potential of 80kV was used in 27 (77.1%) of the contrast-enhanced scans.

2498,"Effect of a proton pump inhibitor on postprandial gastric volume, emptying and symptoms in healthy human subjects: A pilot study. Background: In consensus guidelines, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are recommended for the treatment of functional dyspepsia. It is unclear whether PPIs change gastric volume or emptying. Aim(s): To assess the effect of a PPI, rabeprazole, on gastric volume and emptying and postprandial symptoms. Method(s): In a double-blind, parallel-group placebo-controlled trial, 13 healthy participants were randomized to rabeprazole, 20 mg b.d., or placebo. On day 3, fasting gastric volume was measured using intravenous 99mTc- pertechnate and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). After the last dose of study medication, an 111In-chloride egg meal (300 kcal) was ingested, and postprandial gastric volume and emptying were measured by SPECT. Symptom ratings using a visual analogue scale (fullness, nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, aggregate score) were obtained at baseline and 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 min postprandially. Group comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Result(s): There were no statistically significant differences in gastric volume or emptying in the two groups. However, there was a borderline increase in gastric volume with rabeprazole compared with placebo.

Conclusion(s): In healthy participants, rabeprazole, 20 mg b.d., did not significantly change gastric emptying, but reduced symptoms and had a borderline effect on gastric volume postprandially. The mechanism of reduced postprandial symptoms with a PPI requires further study. © 2006 The Authors.",Excluded,0.03838573
2499,"Benefit of surgery after chemoradiotherapy in stage IIIB (T4 and/or N3) non-small cell lung cancer. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate postchemoradiotherapy surgery in stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. Method(s): Forty patients with stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer were included in this phase II study. A preoperative diagnosis of stage IIIB cancer was based on mediastinoscopy or a thoracotomy in all patients. Induction treatment included two cycles of cisplatin (100 mg/m2, day 1), 5-fluorouracil (1 g/m2, days 1-3), and vinblastine (4 mg/m2, day 1) combined with 42 Gy of hyperfractionated radiotherapy delivering 21 Gy in two sessions. Patients with a clinical response were offered surgery. Result(s): The minimum follow-up for survivors was 48 months. Thirty patients had a T4 lesion and 18 had N3 disease. Twenty-nine patients (73%) had a clinical objective tumor response after induction treatment. These 29 patients underwent thoracotomy, and a complete resection was performed in 23 (58%). Two postoperative deaths occurred (7%). Four patients had a pathologic complete response at the time of surgery (10%). The 5-year survival is 19% for the overall population. When only patients who had persistent viable tumor cells at surgery are considered (n = 25), the 5-year survival is 28%. The 5-year survival is 42% for patients having no mediastinal lymph node involvement at the time of surgery and being treated with complete resection. Conclusion(s): This study shows that surgery, when feasible, is associated with a 28% long-term survival for patients in whom chemoradiotherapy alone fails to control disease.",Excluded,0.03856218

2501,"The features of bone metabolism in patients with periodontal diseases. Background The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between bone metabolic disturbances and periodontal diseases Objectives Several studies discuss the relationship between systemic bone mineral density (BMD) and periodontal diseases. Osteoporosis or low systemic BMD should be considered as the risk factor for periodontal disease progression. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of bone metabolism on the periodontal status in the patients. Methods The study included 89 patients (38 men and 51 women, mean age - 43.5+/-5.1 years) with the healthy periodontal status (HPS) and 231 patients (108 men and 123 women, mean age - 45.6+/-5.2 years) with generalized periodontitis (GP). Clinical conditions of periodontal tissue and radiographic determinations (panoramic X-Ray) were evaluated. Skeletal systemic BMD was measured by DXA. Metabolic processes of bone tissue were evaluated by bone turnover markers: bone tissue formation - osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) in serum and bone tissue resorption marker - deoxypiridinoline (DPD) in urine. Results Comparative analysis of structural and functional state of bone tissue in patients showed a mineral density reduction in GP group compared to HPS, but these changes were not statistically significant. Disorders of bone tissue metabolism and dissociation in the processes of bone tissue remodeling were determined in patients with GP. The OC level in the patients with GP (18.89+/-0.87 ng/ml in men and 20.39+/-1.14 ng/ml in women) was statistically significantly (p<0.01) lower compared to the HPS group (24.14+/-1.04 ng/ml in men and 27.56+/-1.12 ng/ml in women). BAP show significant differences between groups. The level of DPD in the GP group (5.78+/-0.79 mmol in men, 8.34+/-0.56 mmol in women) was significantly higher (p<0.01) compared to HPS group (3.57+/-1.12 mmol in men, 4.47+/-0.76 mmol in women). Conclusions These results suggest that periodontitis associations with bone metabolic disturbances. In patients with periodontitis unbalanced bone remodeling was found: decreased bone formation and increased resorption.",Excluded,0.040560476
2502,"The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in the local management of desmoplastic melanoma. BACKGROUND In the current study, the authors sought to evaluate outcomes, specifically with respect to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), for patients with desmoplastic melanoma. METHODS The records of 130 consecutive patients who presented between 1985 and 2009 with nonmetastatic desmoplastic melanoma and were treated curatively with either surgery alone (59 patients; 45%) or surgery and postoperative RT (71 patients; 55%) were retrospectively reviewed. Ages ranged from 21 years to 97 years (median age, 66 years). The location of the primary tumor was in the head and neck region in 62% of patients. Only 5 patients (4%) had lymph node involvement at the time of presentation. RESULTS The median follow-up was 6.6 years (range, 11 months-24 years). Overall survival rates at 5 years and 10 years were 69% and 53%, respectively. Disease-specific survival rates were 84% and 80%, respectively, at 5 years and 10 years. The actuarial rate of local recurrence was 17% at 5 years and beyond. Of the patients who underwent surgery without receiving postoperative RT, 14 (24%) experienced local recurrence. Of the 71 patients treated with surgery and postoperative RT, 5 (7%) experienced local recurrence. In a Cox multivariate regression model, improved local control was significantly associated with the receipt of postoperative RT (P = .009).

2503,"An analysis of the factors influencing radiation dose and fluoroscopic time during renal artery stent placement. Purpose: To determine the factors that affect mean absorbed dose and fluoroscopic times during renal artery stent placement. Material(s) and Method(s): After institutional review board approval, the HI-IQ database was queried for patients undergoing renal artery stent placement only from January 2007 to June 2010. Procedures that were performed as part of other procedures such as iliac artery stents were excluded. The HI-IQ data included fluoroscopy time (f) and radiation dose (mGy). Demographic, medical history, procedural details, and advanced preprocedural renal artery stent imaging were obtained. Variables (number of stents, average body mass index , number of stents placed per year and number of years service of an interventional physician, pre-procedural imaging, and use of embolic protection device) were analyzed using a t test after log transformation and testing for variance with an F test. Result(s): A total of 134 patients (75 males, 70.6 +/- 10.5 years old) underwent the placement of 177 renal artery stents (unilateral [n =95], average stent per patient =1.3). Mean fluoroscopy time was 15.6 minutes and mean absorbed dose to the patient was 1729 mGy. The average fluoroscopic time and absorbed dose was significantly higher with bilateral stent placement compared to unilateral placement (13.8 vs 19.7 minutes, P =.002; 1803 vs 2380 mGy, P =.03). The average fluoroscopic time was significantly higher in patients undergoing abdominal aortogram prior to renal artery selection and stent placement. Conclusion(s): The placement of more than 1 stent with an abdominal angiogram prior to renal artery stent placement results in increased fluoroscopic time and mean absorbed dose.",Excluded,0.038475912

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of risedronate (RIS) on bone loss and bone turnover markers after liver transplantation (LT). Patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis within the first month after LT were randomized to receive RIS 35 mg/week plus calcium 1000 mg/day and vitamin D3 800 IU/day (n = 45) or calcium and vitamin D3 at same dosages (n = 44). Primary endpoint was change in bone mineral density (BMD) 6 and 12 months after LT. Secondary endpoints included changes in serum beta-CrossLaps (beta-CTX) and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal peptide (P1NP) and fracture rate. Spine X-rays were obtained at baseline and after 12 months. There was no significant difference in BMD changes between both treatment groups at any sites; either at 6 or 12 months. Spine BMD increased in both groups at 12 months vs. baseline (P = 0.001). RIS patients had a significant increase in intertrochanteric BMD at 12 months (P < 0.05 vs. baseline). Serum beta-CTX decreased in both groups (P < 0.01), with significant differences between groups at 3 months. No significant difference in vertebral fracture incidence was found. After 12 months, BMD improved at lumbar spine and did not change at hip in both groups. Significant differences between both groups were not found.

2505,"A clinical and proteomics approach to predict the presence of obstructive peripheral arterial disease: From the Catheter Sampled Blood Archive in Cardiovascular Diseases (CASABLANCA) Study. BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a global health problem that is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated. Noninvasive tools to predict the presence and severity of PAD have limitations including inaccuracy, cost, or need for intravenous contrast and ionizing radiation., HYPOTHESIS: A clinical/biomarker score may offer an attractive alternative diagnostic method for PAD., METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 354 patients referred for diagnostic peripheral and/or coronary angiography, predictors of >=50% stenosis in >=1 peripheral vessel (carotid/subclavian, renal, or lower extremity arteries) were identified from >50 clinical variables and 109 biomarkers. Machine learning identified variables predictive of obstructive PAD; a score derived from the final model was developed., RESULTS: The score consisted of 1 clinical variable (history of hypertension) and 6 biomarkers (midkine, kidney injury molecule-1, interleukin-23, follicle-stimulating hormone, angiopoietin-1, and eotaxin-1). The model had an in-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 for obstructive PAD and a cross-validated area under the curve of 0.84; higher scores were associated with greater severity of angiographic stenosis. At optimal cutoff, the score had 65% sensitivity, 88% specificity, 76% positive predictive value (PPV), and 81% negative predictive value (NPV) for obstructive PAD and performed consistently across vascular territories. Partitioning the score into 5 levels resulted in a PPV of 86% and NPV of 98% in the highest and lowest levels, respectively. Elevated score was associated with shorter time to revascularization during 4.3 years of follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: A clinical/biomarker score demonstrates high accuracy for predicting the presence of PAD.

2506,"Long-term outcomes of a phase II randomized controlled trial comparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy with or without weekly cisplatin for the treatment of locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Salvage treatment for locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is complicated and relatively limited. Radiotherapy, combined with effective concomitant chemotherapy, may improve clinical treatment outcomes. We conducted a phase II randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of intensity-modulated radiotherapy with concomitant weekly cisplatin on locally recurrent NPC., METHODS: Between April 2002 and January 2008, 69 patients diagnosed with non-metastatic locally recurrent NPC were randomly assigned to either concomitant chemoradiotherapy group (n = 34) or radiotherapy alone group (n = 35). All patients received intensity-modulated radiotherapy. The radiotherapy dose for both groups was 60 Gy in 27 fractions for 37 days (range 23-53 days). The concomitant chemotherapy schedule was cisplatin 30 mg/m(2) by intravenous infusion weekly during radiotherapy., RESULTS: The median follow-up period of all patients was 35 months (range 2-112 months). Between concomitant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups, there was only significant difference in the 3-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates (68.7% vs. 42.2%, P = 0.016 and 41.8% vs. 27.5%, P = 0.049, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed that concomitant chemoradiotherapy significantly improved the 5-year OS rate especially for patients in stage rT3-4 (33.0% vs. 13.2%, P = 0.009), stages III-IV (34.3% vs. 13.2%, P = 0.006), recurrence interval >30 months (49.0% vs. 20.6%, P = 0.017), and tumor volume >26 cm(3) (37.6% vs. 0%, P = 0.006)., CONCLUSION: Compared with radiotherapy alone, concomitant chemoradiotherapy can improve OS of the patients with locally recurrent NPC, especially those with advanced T category (rT3-4) and stage (III-IV) diseases, recurrence intervals >30 months, and tumor volume >26 cm(3).",Excluded,0.03818165
2507,"The complex relationship between lung tumor volume and survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated by definitive radiotherapy: A prospective, observational prognostic factor study of the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG 99.05). Background and purpose: To investigate the hypothesis that primary tumor volume is prognostic independent of T and N stages in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated by definitive radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): Multicenter prospective observational study. Patient eligibility: pathologically proven stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer planned for definitive radiotherapy (minimum 50 Gy in 20 fractions) using CT-based contouring. Volumes of the primary tumor and enlarged nodes were measured according to a standardized protocol. Survival was adjusted for the effect of T and N stage. Result(s): There were 509 eligible patients. Five-year survival rates for tumor volume grouped by quartiles were, for increasing tumor volume, 22%, 14%, 15% and 21%. Larger primary tumor volume was associated with shorter survival (HR = 1.060 (per doubling); 95% CI 1.01-1.12; P = 0.029). However, after adjusting for the effects of T and N stage, there was no evidence for an association (HR = 1.029, 95% CI, 0.96-1.10, P = 0.39). There was evidence, however, that larger primary tumor volume was associated with an increased risk of dying, independently of T and N stage, in the first 18 months but not beyond. Conclusion(s): In patients treated by non-surgical means we were unable to show that lung tumor volume, overall, provides additional prognostic information beyond the T and N stage (TNM, 6th edition). There is evidence, however, that larger primary tumor volume adversely affects outcome only within the first 18 months. Larger tumor size alone should not by itself exclude patients from curative (chemo)radiotherapy. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.03997686
2508,"Integrating Salvage Hypofractionated Radiosurgery with Low-Dose Adjuvant VEGF for Locally Recurrent Brain Metastasis with High-Dose Irradiation Previously. Purpose/Objective(s): Selection of the appropriate treatment for recurrent brain metastasis remains uncertain. Recent studies have demonstrated a significant response rate and acceptable toxicity with the use of fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (FSRS) in locally recurrent glioblastoma and large brain metastasis patients due to high ""therapeutic ratio"" (ratio of tumor cell killing to normal tissue toxicity).However, radiation necrosis (RN) is a severe complication associated with salvage re-irradiation. RN may be treated with bevacizumab, which blocks the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor in leakage-prone capillaries. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of FSRS combined with the early use of low-dose bevacizumab as a new salvage treatment scheme for locally recurrent brain metastases with high dose irradiation. Materials/Methods: Patients with locally recurrent intracranial metastasis previously treated with SRS or WBRT with SRS were enrolled in this prospective study. The salvage FSRS dose ranged from 9.5to 29 Gy in two to five sessions with 62-75% isodoseline by robotic radiosurgery according to the brain tumor volume, site, and previous irradiation dose. Bevacizumab was prescribed to all patients within 24 hours after completion of the treatment for four cycles (5 mg/kg, 3-week intervals).Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), adverse events, and associated clinical outcomes were recorded. The primary objective of this study was to identify the overall survival after salvage treatment. Secondary objectives included clinical response (KPS), imaging response (MRI), and treatment-related adverse events. Result(s): From December 2009 to October 2016, a total of 24 patients were enrolled. Of these patients, 9 received WBRT followed by SRS, and 15 underwent SRS. The median 1-year overall survival (OS) after salvage SRS was 87.5%. Twenty-three (96%) patients had a positive imaging response within a range of 6 to 22 cm3 (median 14 cm3, p= 0.032, paired t-test). Significant clinical improvement was achieved (p<0.05, best KPS, paired t-test). Grade 1/2 fatigue was observed in 8 (33%) patients. Other grade 1 or 2 toxicities included headache, hypertension, and nausea. Grade 3 fatigue and headache occurred in 1 patient. No grade 4 toxicity was observed. Conclusion(s): Salvage FSRS with early use of low dose adjuvant bevacizumab treatment showed favorable clinical and radiologic control with manageable toxicity for locally recurrent brain metastasis patients who underwent high dose irradiation previously. The diagnosis of RN and LR after salvage FSRS merit further study.Copyright © 2019",Excluded,0.03813741
2509,"Achieving routine submillisievert CT scanning: report from the summit on management of radiation dose in CT. This Special Report presents the consensus of the Summit on Management of Radiation Dose in Computed Tomography (CT) (held in February 2011), which brought together participants from academia, clinical practice, industry, and regulatory and funding agencies to identify the steps required to reduce the effective dose from routine CT examinations to less than 1 mSv. The most promising technologies and methods discussed at the summit include innovations and developments in x-ray sources; detectors; and image reconstruction, noise reduction, and postprocessing algorithms. Access to raw projection data and standard data sets for algorithm validation and optimization is a clear need, as is the need for new, clinically relevant metrics of image quality and diagnostic performance. Current commercially available techniques such as automatic exposure control, optimization of tube potential, beam-shaping filters, and dynamic z-axis collimators are important, and education to successfully implement these methods routinely is critically needed. Other methods that are just becoming widely available, such as iterative reconstruction, noise reduction, and postprocessing algorithms, will also have an important role. Together, these existing techniques can reduce dose by a factor of two to four. Technical advances that show considerable promise for additional dose reduction but are several years or more from commercial availability include compressed sensing, volume of interest and interior tomography techniques, and photon-counting detectors. This report offers a strategic roadmap for the CT user and research and manufacturer communities toward routinely achieving effective doses of less than 1 mSv, which is well below the average annual dose from naturally occurring sources of radiation.",Excluded,0.038344238

2511,"Radiation risks in lung cancer screening programs: a comparison with nuclear industry workers and atomic bomb survivors. The National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated that screening with low-dose CT (LDCT) scan reduced lung cancer and overall mortality by 20% and 7%, respectively. The LDCT scanning involves an approximate 2-mSv dose, whereas full-chest CT scanning, the major diagnostic study used to follow up nodules, may involve a dose of 8 mSv. Radiation associated with CT scanning and other diagnostic studies to follow up nodules may present an independent risk of lung cancer. On the basis of the NLST, we estimated the incidence and prevalence of nodules detected in screening programs. We followed the Fleischner guidelines for follow-up of nodules to assess cumulative radiation exposure over 20- and 30-year periods. We then evaluated nuclear worker cohort studies and atomic bomb survivor studies to assess the risk of lung cancer from radiation associated with long-term lung cancer screening programs. The findings indicate that a 55-year-old lung screening participant may experience a cumulative radiation exposure of up to 280 mSv over a 20-year period and 420 mSv over 30 years. These exposures exceed those of nuclear workers and atomic bomb survivors. This assessment suggests that long-term (20-30 years) LDCT screening programs are associated with nontrivial cumulative radiation doses. Current lung cancer screening protocols, if conducted over 20- to 30-year periods, can independently increase the risk of lung cancer beyond cigarette smoking as a result of cumulative radiation exposure. Radiation exposures from LDCT screening and follow-up diagnostic procedures exceed lifetime radiation exposures among nuclear power workers and atomic bomb survivors.",Excluded,0.97079283

The relationship between bowel dose volume data and late bowel toxicity in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated with radical radiotherapy was assessed., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bowel was contoured retrospectively on radiotherapy plans of 47 patients recruited to the BC2001 trial (CRUK/01/004). The relationship between bowel volume at various dose levels and prospectively collected late bowel toxicity was explored., RESULTS: Fifteen per cent and 6% of patients experienced grade 1 and grade 2 or more late bowel toxicity, respectively. The mean bowel volume was significantly less at doses >=50 Gy in those treated with reduced high dose volume radiotherapy compared with standard radiotherapy. The probability of late bowel toxicity increased as bowel volume increased (P <= 0.05 for dose levels 30-50 Gy). No grade 2 or more late bowel toxicity was observed in patients with bowel volumes under the thresholds given in the model that predict for 25% probability of late bowel toxicity., CONCLUSIONS: There is a dose volume effect for late bowel toxicity in radical bladder radiotherapy. We have modelled the probability of late bowel toxicity from absolute bowel volumes to guide clinicians in assessing radical bladder radiotherapy plans. Thresholds predicting for a 25% probability of late bowel toxicity are proposed as dose volume constraints. Copyright © 2014. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded,0.04137963

Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose-rate brachytherapy for local control and relapse-free survival in squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas of the lips. We compared two groups: one with tumors on the skin and the other with tumors on the lip. Patients and Methods: All patients had been treated at Claudius Regaud Cancer Centre from 1990 to 2008 for squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma. Low-dose-rate brachytherapy was performed with iridium 192 wires according to the Paris system rules. On average, the dose delivered was 65 Gy. Result(s): 172 consecutive patients were included in our study; 69 had skin carcinoma (squamous cell or basal cell), and 92 had squamous cell mucosal carcinoma. The average follow-up time was 5.4 years. In the skin cancer group, there were five local recurrences and one lymph node recurrence. In the mucosal cancer group, there were ten local recurrences and five lymph node recurrences. The 8-year relapse-free survival for the entire population was 80%. The 8-year relapse-free survival was 85% for skin carcinoma 75% for mucosal carcinoma, with no significant difference between groups. The functional results were satisfactory for 99% of patients, and the cosmetic results were satisfactory for 92%. Maximal toxicity observed was Grade 2.

The mortality and cancer morbidity experience of the 470 male Sellafield employees known to be involved in the 1957 Windscale accident is reported. All these employees are known to have been involved in dealing with the fire itself, or in the clean-up operation afterwards. The size of the study population is small, leading to predicted low power to reveal any effects, but the cohort is of interest because of the involvement of the workers in the accident. For 1957-97, using rates for England and Wales to calculate the expected numbers, the all causes standardised mortality ratio (SMR) is 100 (observed = 258, expected = 258.80), and the all malignant neoplasms SMR is 79 (observed = 58, expected = 73.12) which is not significantly different from 100.

Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy in patients with inoperable endobronchial carcinoma. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed the records (April 1991 - May 2004) of patients with non-small-cell carcinoma, with no extrabronchial spread on computed tomography scans, who underwent HDR brachytherapy because of contraindications to surgery and external beam radiation therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared by the log-rank test. Prognostic factors were analyzed by multivariate analysis. Result(s): 226 patients (223 men, 3 women, mean age: 62.2 years (range, 40-84)) were included. Of those, 217 (97%) had squamous cell carcinoma (Tis/T1/T2/Tx: 60/153/9/4). Dose was prescribed at 1 cm from the radius (24-35 Gy in 4-6 fractions). Mean follow-up was 30.4 months (range, 9-116). Complete endoscopic response rate was 93.6% at 3 months. One hundred twenty-eight patients (56%) died of intercurrent disease (n = 45), local failure (n = 36), metastasis (n = 10), local failure and metastasis (n = 11), complications (n = 13), and other causes (n = 12).

All biopsies and histologic diagnoses were made by the same surgeon and pathologist, respectively., RESULTS: In 23 patients undergoing resection <60 days after biopsy, the biopsy diagnosis was consistent with resection diagnosis in 18 cases (79%) and led to the correct treatment in 22 cases (96%). Recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) was undergraded as anaplastic astrocytoma in 4 patients. GBM was misdiagnosed as radiation necrosis in 1 patient. MR-nonenhancing lesions [10/10 (100%)] yielded histology that correlated with subsequent craniotomy, while only 8/13 (61%) MR-enhancing lesions yielded histology that was consistent with that at craniotomy (p < 0.05). In 20 patients undergoing resection because of radiologic tumor progression (mean 7 months after biopsy), 6/6 (100%) biopsy diagnoses of a specific glioma grade correlated with resection diagnosis, while only 6/14 (43%) biopsy diagnoses of radiation effect correlated with resection diagnosis (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: MRI-guided stereotactic brain biopsy specimen accurately represents the grade of the larger glioma mass sufficiently to guide subsequent therapy. Enhancement on MR may be a negative prognostic indicator of biopsy accuracy.",Excluded,0.039621655
2519,"Applied cancer prevention in practice. In 1982, more than 125,000 cancer cases in the United States should be preventable. Every physician should advise all patients to eliminate all tobacco use, moderate alcohol use, avoid the use of drugs which are carcinogenic, minimize sun and x-ray exposure, maintain an ideal weight, and follow a ""prudent"" diet. Secondary prevention efforts would include the American Cancer Society recommendations for the early detection of cancer in asymptomatic persons. Worldwide epidemiologic studies suggest that over 80% of human cancer is due to factors in the environment such as diet, life style, and synthetic chemical contaminants, and perhaps a complex interaction of factors including genetic susceptibility. Current research into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and in the role of diet in cancer cause, are underway.

2521,"Radiation Exposure During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Impact of Arterial Approach and Prosthesis Type. Background: The impact of novel alternative access and valve type on radiation exposure during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has not yet been evaluated. This study sought to determine the impact of a transarterial approach and prosthesis type on physician and patient exposure to radiation during TAVR. Method(s): This was a prospective study including 140 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR by transfemoral (n = 102) or transcarotid (TC) (n = 38) access at 2 centers. Implanted valves were the self-expanding Evolut R/PRO system (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN; n = 38) and the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA; n = 102). The primary endpoint was first operator radiation exposure. The secondary endpoint was patient radiation exposure. Result(s): First operator radiation exposure was 4-fold greater during TC TAVR (P < .001). The use of a self-expanding valve was associated with a longer x-ray time (P = .015) and a 2-fold greater first operator radiation dose (P = .018). Patient radiation dose was not significantly affected by arterial approach (P = .055) or valve type (P = .095). After adjustment for potential confounders, the TC approach remained associated with a 174.8% (95% confidence interval, 80.6-318.3, P < .001) increase in first operator radiation dose, whereas the use of a self-expanding valve no longer influenced the first operator dose (P = .630). Conclusion(s): TC access and the use of a self-expanding valve were associated with a 4- and 2-fold greater first operator radiation exposure during TAVR procedures, respectively. Unlike the arterial approach, the effect of bioprosthesis type on radiation exposure was mainly related to x-ray time and was no longer significant after adjustment.Copyright © 2021 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons",Excluded,0.038500562
2522,"Carotid intima-medial thickness as a marker of radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis. PURPOSE: Arterial thickening is a precursor to atherosclerosis. Carotid intima-medial thickness (CIMT), a measure of arterial thickening, is a validated surrogate for prediction of cerebrovascular events. This study investigates CIMT as an early marker of radiation-induced carotid artery damage., MATERIALS/METHODS: Head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) (minimum dose of 50 Gy) to one side of the neck (unirradiated side as control) at least 2 years previously were included. CIMT was measured in 4 arterial segments: proximal, mid, distal common carotid artery (CCA), and bifurcation and were compared to corresponding unirradiated segments. CIMT measurements >75th percentile of a reference population were considered abnormal and at increased cerebrovascular risk., RESULTS: 50 patients (34 males) with a median age of 58 years (interquartile range (IQR) 50-62) were included. The mean maximum dose to the irradiated and unirradiated artery was 53 Gy (standard deviation (SD) 13 Gy) and 1.9 Gy (SD 3.7 Gy), respectively. Mean CIMT was significantly greater in irradiated versus unirradiated arteries: proximal CCA (0.76 mm +/- 0.15 vs 0.68 mm +/- 0.14 (p<0.0001), mid CCA (0.74 mm +/- 0.2 vs 0.68 mm +/- 0.16 (p=0.01), distal CCA (0.77 mm +/- 0.2 vs 0.68 mm +/- 0.15 (p=0.004), and bifurcation (0.85 mm +/- 0.25 vs 0.72 mm +/- 0.17 (p=0.001). For all arterial segments, a significantly greater number of CIMT measurements were abnormal on the irradiated side (proximal: p=0.004, mid: p=0.05, distal: p=0.005, bifurcation: p=0.03). There was no effect of time from RT, age, smoking status, surgery and chemotherapy on CIMT difference (irradiated-unirradiated) in all segments., CONCLUSIONS: CIMT is increased after RT and may be a useful marker of radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis. There appears to be no additional effect of other atherosclerotic risk factors on CIMT following RT. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.97054696
2523,"Measuring Corneal Haze by Using Scheimpflug Photography and Confocal Microscopy. PURPOSE: We compared corneal backscatter estimated from a Scheimpflug camera with backscatter estimated from a clinical confocal microscope across a wide range of corneal haze., METHODS: A total of 59 corneas from 35 patients with a range of severity of Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy and 15 corneas from 9 normal participants were examined using a Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam) and a confocal microscope (ConfoScan 4). The mean image brightness from the anterior 120 mum, midcornea, and posterior 60 mum of the cornea across the central 2 mm recorded by the Scheimpflug camera and analogous regions from the confocal microscope were measured and standardized. Differences between instruments and correlations between backscatter and disease severity were determined by using generalized estimating equation models., RESULTS: Backscatter measured by the two instruments in the anterior and midcornea were correlated (r = 0.67 and 0.43, respectively, P < 0.001), although in the posterior cornea they were not correlated (r = 0.13, P = 0.66). Measured with the Scheimpflug camera, mean backscatter from the anterior and midcornea were greater, whereas backscatter from the posterior cornea was lower (P < 0.001) than that measured by the confocal microscope. Backscatter from the anterior cornea was correlated with disease severity for both instruments (Scheimpflug, r = 0.55, P < 0.001; confocal, r = 0.49, P = 0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: The Scheimpflug camera and confocal microscope should not be used interchangeably to measure corneal haze. The ability to detect changes in backscatter with disease severity is superior with the Scheimpflug camera. However, the confocal microscope provides higher resolution of corneal structure.",Excluded,0.03869208

Exposure to SMF (100-220 mT, 15-40 T/m for 1h) did not affect the threshold for detecting auditory brainstem responses. Serial seizures elevated the hearing threshold at some frequencies, but there was no difference between SMF-exposed and unexposed control mice. EEG changes were recorded during audiogenic seizures. Pretreatment with SMF prolonged seizure latency in response to stimulation with white noise of increasing intensity from 74 to 102 dBA (1 min interval between 2 and 4 dBA increments) without significant effects on seizure severity. Gender-related differences were not statistically significant. Stimulation with 10 min sound steps revealed prolongation of latency and reduction of seizure severity in SMF-exposed, but not unexposed, mice. Pretreatment with phenytoin (5 mg/kg) in combination with SMF had significantly greater effects on seizure latency and severity than either pretreatment alone. These findings indicate that the SMF studied here under different conditions elevated seizure threshold and had anticonvulsant properties in Black Swiss mice and increased the efficacy of a conventional anticonvulsant drug.",Excluded,0.38776106
2526,"Arterial Stiffness as a Biomarker of Radiation-Induced Carotid Atherosclerosis. Arterial stiffness is thought to be a precursor to atherosclerosis. Conventional arterial stiffness parameters as potential biomarkers of radiation-induced damage were investigated. Patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy >=2 years previously to one side of the neck were included. The unirradiated side was the internal control. Beta stiffness index (B) and elastic modulus (Ep) were used to assess arterial stiffness and were measured in proximal, mid, and distal common carotid artery (CCA) and compared with the corresponding unirradiated segments. Fifty patients (68% male; median age 58 years; interquartile range 50-62) were included. Mean +/- standard deviation maximum doses to irradiated and unirradiated arteries were 53 +/- 13 and 1.9 +/- 3.7 Gy, respectively. Differences in B were not significant. Significant differences in Ep were demonstrated-proximal CCA: 1301 +/- 1223 versus 801 +/- 492 (P < .0001), mid CCA: 1064 +/- 818 versus 935.5 +/- 793 (P < .0001), and distal CCA: 1267 +/- 1084 versus 775.3 +/- 551.9 (P < .0001).

Background: Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is an emerging infectious disease in immunocompromised hosts. However, the clinical characteristics of these patients are poorly understood in mainland China. Method(s): We performed a retrospective study of PCP from 2008 to 2012. Information was collected regarding clinical manifestations, hospitalization, and outcome. A prognostic analysis was performed using a Cox regression model. Result(s): 151 cases of PCP were included; 46 non-HIV and 105 HIV cases. All-cause mortality (15.2% vs. 12.4%, p = 0.64) and the results of time-to-event analysis (log-rank test, p = 0.62) were similar between non-HIV and HIV infected cases, respectively. From 2008 to 2012, time from admission to initial treatment in non-HIV infected PCP patients showed declining trend [median (range) 20 (9-44) vs. 12 (4-24) vs. 9 (2-23) vs. 7 (2-22) vs. 7 (1-14) days]. A similar trend was observed for all-cause mortality (33.3% vs. 20.0% vs.14.3% vs. 14.3% vs. 6.7%). Patients with four or more of the following clinical manifestations (cough, dyspnea, fever, chest pain, and weight loss) [adjusted HR (AHR) 29.06, 95% CI 2.13-396.36, P = 0.01] and admission to intensive care unit (ICU) [AHR 22.55, 95% CI 1.36-375.06, P = 0.03] were independently associated with allcause mortality in non-HIV infected PCP patients.

2530,"Effect of constraint loading on the lower limb muscle forces in weightless treadmill exercise. Long exposure to the microgravity will lead to muscle atrophy and bone loss. Treadmill exercise could mitigate the musculoskeletal decline. But muscle atrophy remains inevitable. The constraint loading applied on astronauts could affect the muscle force and its atrophy severity. However, the quantitative correlation between constraint loading mode and muscle forces remains unclear. This study aimed to characterize the influence of constraint loading mode on the lower limb muscle forces in weightless treadmill exercise. The muscle forces in the full gait cycle were calculated with the inverse dynamic model of human musculoskeletal system. The calculated muscle forces at gravity were validated with the EMG data. Muscle forces increased at weightlessness compared with those at the earth's gravity. The increasing percentage from high to low is as follows: biceps femoris, gastrocnemius, soleus, vastus, and rectus femoris, which was in agreement with the muscle atrophy observed in astronauts. The constraint loading mode had an impact on the muscle forces in treadmill exercise and thus could be manipulated to enhance the effect of the muscle training in spaceflight. The findings could provide biomechanical basis for the optimization of treadmill constraint system and training program and improve the countermeasure efficiency in spaceflight.Copyright © 2018 Ning Guo et al.",Excluded,0.039350234
2531,"Radiation therapy for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma in elderly patients. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment outcome and toxicities of radiation therapy alone for elderly patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): Seventy-three patients of 70 years old or above treated at our institution between January 1995 and December 2008 for locoregionally advanced NPC (stage III-IVA) were reviewed and analyzed. All patients were treated in a uniform fashion using our institutional protocol with using conformal radiation therapy alone. Measured outcomes included 4-year overall survival (OS), tumor-specific survival (TSS), disease-free survival (DFS), local control (LC), regional relapse-free survival (RRFS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), as well as late toxicity. Result(s): The median follow-up for all 73 patients at the time of this analysis was 45 months (range, 5-152 months). The 4-year OS, TSS, DFS, LC, RRFS, and DMFS were 51.0, 64.5, 54.7, 83.7, 80.6, and 63.5, respectively. Radiation therapy was well tolerated in this group of patients. Multivariate analyses revealed that clinical stage (P = 0.006) and comorbidities (P = 0.018) were significant prognosticators for OS, both N classification (P = 0.023) and comorbidities (P = 0.032) were significant prognosticators for DFS, N classification was the only independent prognostic factor for both TSS (P = 0.002) and DMFS (P = 0.004); and residual disease in the primary site was the only independent predictive factor for LC (P = 0.026). Conclusion(s): Radiation therapy alone can achieve a reasonable local and regional control in NPC patients with advanced age; however, distant metastasis remained the dominant failure pattern of our series. The presence of comorbidities was an important negative prognostic factor for treatment outcome. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded,0.038573015
2532,"The benefits of psychosocial interventions for cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Background: Many patients with cancer experience depression and anxiety, and an associated decrease in quality of life (QOL) during radiation therapy (RT). The main objective of the study was to determine the benefits of psychosocial interventions for cancer patients who received RT. Method(s): Patients with cancer (n = 178) who agreed to participate in the study were randomized to the intervention arm (n = 89) or the control arm (n = 89). Patients in the intervention group received psychosocial care during RT, whereas the control group received RT only. The benefits of the intervention were evaluated using the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) to measure depression, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) to survey health-related QOL. The association between intervention and survival was also assessed. Result(s): Patients randomly assigned to the intervention arm showed significant improvements on symptoms of depression (p < 0.05) and anxiety (p < 0.05), health-related QOL (p < 0.05) (i.e. better global health status, and physical and emotional functioning, and less insomnia) when compared with controls. In the subset analysis, female patients, those that received high dose irradiation, and those that underwent adjuvant chemotherapy could benefit more from psychosocial intervention. There was no difference between the two groups in disease-free survival (DFS) (2-year DFS 79.8% in the intervention arm and 76.4% in the control arm; p = 0.527) and overall survival (OS) (2-year OS 83.1% in the intervention arm and 84.3% in the control arm; p = 0.925). Conclusion(s): Psychosocial intervention is a cost-effective approach that can improve a patient's mood and QOL both during and after RT.

2533,"Have increases in solar ultraviolet exposure contributed to the rise in incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?. The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has increased substantially in many countries over recent decades. The aetiology of this cancer is poorly understood, and this rise is largely unexplained. The incidence of NHL is known to increase markedly following immune suppression. In the light of evidence that exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) may cause systemic immune suppression, part of the recent increase in NHL incidence may reflect population-based increases in UVR exposure. That such exposure increases have occurred is inferred from the widespread increases in skin cancer incidence in fair-skinned populations, especially malignant melanoma (MM), over recent decades. Epidemiological evidence presented here in support of the proposed UVR-NHL relationship includes the following: in Caucasian populations there is a moderate positive correlation between ambient UVR level, by latitude, and NHL incidence; there is also a positive correlation between time trends in MM incidence and NHL; there is some evidence that migration across latitude gradients induces concordant shifts in risks of NHL and MM. Data from two historical cancer patient registers show that, in individuals, these two cancers concurred a little more often than expected. These findings support recent suggestions that UVR-induced impairment of immune functioning contributes to the aetiology of NHL.",Excluded,0.03936332
2534,"Validation of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay for use as a triage biological dosimetry tool. Traditionally, the dicentric chromosome assay (DCA) has been used to derive biological dose estimates for unknown radiological exposures. While sensitive, this assay requires highly trained evaluators and is extremely time consuming. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay has been suggested as an alternative to the DCA, as it is much faster to evaluate samples and requires less technical expertise. In order to validate this assay for triage biodosimetry, dose-response curves were generated for six donors at eight doses of gamma-radiation (0-4.0 Gy). Each sample was evaluated by 12 individuals, among three different laboratories and the incidence of micronuclei was determined after counting 50-500 binucleated cells. This study demonstrated that the CBMN assay was capable of detecting radiation doses >or=1 Gy after scoring only 200 binucleated cells. As such, the CBMN assay may provide a sensitive and reliable technique for deployment as an initial screening tool in a large-scale radiological emergency where large numbers of biological dose estimates are required.",Included,0.9707354

2536,"Upfront Gamma Knife radiosurgery for Cushing's disease and acromegaly: A multicenter, international study. OBJECTIVE Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) is typically used after failed resection in patients with Cushing's disease (CD) and acromegaly. Little is known about the upfront role of GKS for patients with CD and acromegaly. In this study, the authors examine the outcome of upfront GKS for patients with these functioning adenomas. METHODS An international group of 7 Gamma Knife centers sent pooled data from 46 patients (21 with CD and 25 with acromegaly) undergoing upfront GKS to the coordinating center of the study for analysis. Diagnosis was established on the basis of clinical, endocrine, and radiological studies. All patients were treated on a common radiosurgical platform and longitudinally followed for tumor control, endocrine remission, and hypopituitarism. Patients received a tumor median margin dose of 25 Gy (range 12-40.0 Gy) at a median isodose of 50%. RESULTS The median endocrine follow-up was 69.5 months (range 9-246 months). Endocrine remission was achieved in 51% of the entire cohort, with 28% remission in acromegaly and 81% remission for those with CD at the 5-year interval. Patients with CD achieved remission earlier as compared to those with acromegaly (p = 0.0005). In patients post-GKS, the pituitary adenoma remained stable (39%) or reduced (61%) in size. Hypopituitarism occurred in 9 patients (19.6%), and 1 (2.2%) developed third cranial nerve (CN III) palsy. Eight patients needed further intervention, including repeat GKS in 6 and transsphenoidal surgery in 2. CONCLUSIONS Upfront GKS resulted in good tumor control as well as a low rate of adverse radiation effects in the whole group. Patients with CD achieved a faster and far better remission rate after upfront GKS in comparison to patients with acromegaly. GKS can be considered as an upfront treatment in carefully selected patients with CD who are unwilling or unable to undergo resection, but it has a more limited role in acromegaly.Copyright ©AANS 2019",Excluded,0.04109573

Previously we demonstrated median survival of 69 weeks after combination therapy of permanent, lowactivity I-125 seeds and BCNU wafers for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We designed this prospective phase I trial to assess efficacy of this combination treatment for newly diagnosed GBM. Patients with newly diagnosed GBMs deemed amenable to gross total resection were included. This dose-escalation study of I-125 seeds included three 6-patient cohorts, receiving increasing doses of 3000, 6000, and 9000 cGy, and a maximal number of BCNU wafers placed surgically. Postoperatively patients underwent standard fractionated radiation to 5,940 cGy followed by temozolomide chemotherapy. During enrollment of the first 6-patient cohort, the trial was stopped when 3 of 5 patients developed radiation toxicity. Five patients (median age 55 years, range 46-64 years) completed postoperative radiation; Karnofsky Performance Status ranged from 70 to 90. This lowest-dose cohort received I-125 seeds at 3,000 cGy and maximal BCNU wafer placement, and reached endpoint (median 26 weeks follow-up). Two patients developed local disease progression (median 34.4 weeks). The 3 patients who developed radiation toxicity, which was documented on follow-up MRI and confirmed by MRI spectroscopy (median 20 weeks), underwent treatment with steroids and bevacizumab. Our phase I study was closed during enrollment of the first 6-patient cohort because of the high incidence (60 %) of early radiation toxicity.

2538,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy with concurrent full-dose gemcitabine for locally advanced pancreatic cancer: A pilot trial demonstrating safety. Background: Concurrent chemoradiation is a standard option for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Concurrent conventional radiation with full-dose gemcitabine has significant toxicity. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may provide the opportunity to administer radiation in a shorter time frame with similar efficacy and reduced toxicity. This Pilot study assessed the safety of concurrent full-dose gemcitabine with SBRT for LAPC. Method(s): Patients received gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 for 6 cycles. During week 4 of cycle 1, patients received SBRT (25 Gy delivered in five consecutive daily fractions of 5 Gy prescribed to the 75-83% isodose line). Acute and late toxicities were assessed using NIH CTCAE v3. Tumor response was assessed by RECIST. Patients underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy at baseline, 2, and 6 months to assess the duodenal mucosa. Quality of life (QoL) data was collected before and after treatment using the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 questionnaires. Result(s): Between September 2009 and February 2011, 11 patients enrolled with one withdrawal during radiation therapy. Patients had grade 1 to 2 gastrointestinal toxicity from the start of SBRT to 2 weeks after treatment. There were no grade 3 or greater radiation-related toxicities or delays for cycle 2 of gemcitabine. On endoscopy, there were no grade 2 or higher mucosal toxicities. Two patients had a partial response. The median progression free and overall survival were 6.8 and 12.2 months, respectively. Global QoL did not change between baseline and immediately after radiation treatment. Conclusion(s): SBRT with concurrent full dose gemcitabine is safe when administered to patients with LAPC. There is no delay in administration of radiation or chemotherapy, and radiation is completed with minimal toxicity. © 2013 Gurka et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded,0.03819522

OBJECTIVE: The incidence of postflight orthostatic intolerance after short-duration spaceflight is about 20%. However, the incidence after long-duration spaceflight was unknown. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that orthostatic intolerance is more severe after long-duration than after short-duration flight., METHODS: We performed tilt tests on six astronauts before and after long-duration (129-190 days) spaceflights and compared these data with data obtained during stand tests before and after previous short-duration missions., RESULTS: Five of the six astronauts studied became presyncopal during tilt testing after long-duration flights. Only one had become presyncopal during stand testing after short-duration flights. We also compared the long-duration flight tilt test data to tilt test data from 20 different astronauts who flew on the short-duration Shuttle missions that delivered and recovered the astronauts to and from the Mir Space Station. Five of these 20 astronauts became presyncopal on landing day. Heart rate responses to tilt were no different between astronauts on long-duration flights and astronauts on short-duration flights, but long-duration subjects had lower stroke volumes and cardiac outputs than short-duration presyncopal subjects, suggesting a possible decrease in cardiac contractile function. One subject had subnormal norepinephrine release with upright posture after the long flight but not after the short flight. Plasma volume losses were not greater after long flights., CONCLUSION: Long-duration spaceflight markedly increases orthostatic intolerance, probably with multiple contributing factors.",Excluded,0.039468903

Large-caliber vessels in the cervical, axillary, or inguinal regions were most commonly used to revascularize flaps. Vein grafts were used in five cases for the artery (2/5) or vein (3/5). Pedicle thrombosis occurred in three cases in recipient vessels located within the irradiated field. Two flaps were salvaged; one was lost, and the patient required a second free-flap reconstruction. The mean follow-up was 40 months (range: 2.5 to 83 months). The disease-free survival rate was 67 percent (20/30), local failures occurred in 10 percent (3/30) of patients, and 23.3 percent (7/30) of patients either died or were lost to follow-up. Healing of radiation-induced wounds may be achieved using free-tissue transfers, but complications are frequent. Large-caliber irradiated vessels maybe used to revascularize flaps, but there may be an increased risk of pedicle thrombosis.",Excluded,0.15366063
2541,"Arthroscopic removal of arch-shaped rotator cuff calcifying tendinitis without rotator cuff repair and acromioplasty is an excellent treatment regarding pain relief and function. Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical outcome for arthroscopic removal of calcium deposit without acromioplasty and rotator cuff repair for patients with ultrasound-diagnosed arch-shaped calcifying tendinitis of the rotator cuff (type I), homogenic (x-ray) with chronic pain. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 50 patients with homogenous, arch-shaped calcifying tendinitis, suffering from chronic pain and who underwent arthroscopic treatment and 50 patients with the same type of tendinitis treated conservatively. All patients had calcium deposit located in supraspinatus tendon, pre-operatively and post-operatively evaluated by ultrasound. Clinical outcome was assessed by using Quick DASH, UCLA, and VAS score. Result(s): There were 29 male and 71 female patients; none had bilateral involvement. We divided patients into group A-operatively treated-and group B-conservatively treated-by shock wave therapy. Patients from group A had higher improvement of all used tests, QDash (from 19.3 to 2.7), UCLA (from 10 to 34), and VAS score (from 3 to 0) when compared with group B. Conclusion(s): Patients with arch-shaped calcium deposits and acoustic shadow have better results after arthroscopic treatment than the conservative one. There was no need for acromioplasty or tendon repair. The lack of performing the same did not have any impact on the post-operative rehabilitation and recovery.Copyright © 2021, SICOT aisbl.",Excluded,0.03841434
2542,"Relationship between cone-beam CT technique and diagnostic usefulness in patients undergoing embolotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Aim To determine the effect of different numbers of projection images in C-arm cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) on diagnostic content and image quality in patients undergoing angiographic embolotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and methods A total of 29 patients who underwent contrast-enhanced conventional multidetector CT (MDCT) within 6 weeks prior to CBCT acquired during embolotherapy for HCC between 2010 and 2013 were included in the study. CBCT was acquired in each patient using a 5-s (248 projection images) or 8-s (396 projection images) protocol. Anonymised images were reviewed independently by an interventional radiologist blinded to CBCT group. MDCT was used as a reference to the patient's anatomy, and performance of CBCT was compared to that of MDCT in each group. The level of concordance between CBCT and MDCT within each group was assessed for the following variables: number of foci >1 cm, largest tumour diameter, highest order branching vessel identified, image quality, diagnostic quality, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). CBCT radiation dose was recorded. Results There was no significant difference between MDCT and CBCT within each group in the number of tumour foci >1 cm identified or size of the largest focus measured. MDCT had superior image quality compared to both CBCT groups (p<0.01), but CBCT demonstrated subsegmental branches more often in each group than MDCT. Both CBCT groups demonstrated higher CNR than MDCT (p<0.01). The dose-area product (3675+/-1295 versus 6598+/-1252 muGy.m2; p<0.001) and skin dose (119+/-41 versus 212+/-38 mGy; p<0.001) were significantly lower with 5-s CBCT than with 8-s CBCT. Conclusion The relationship between MDCT and CBCT in both groups was consistent. The information obtained with 5-s CBCT was equivalent to that obtained with 8-s CBCT but with a lower radiation dose.Copyright © 2017 The Royal College of Radiologists",Excluded,0.03841449

Background and purpose: This phase II study evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of weekly cisplatin along with concomitant boost accelerated radiation regimen in patients with locally advanced unresectable head and neck carcinoma. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 94 patients (median age, 58 years) with UICC stage III (n=19) and IV (n=75) cancer of the oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx and oral cavity were included. Patients received radiotherapy with a concomitant boost scheme (1.8 Gy on days 1-40 and 1.5 Gy boost on days 25-40 with a total dose of 72 Gy) and concurrent cisplatin, 40 mg/m2 weekly, for the first 4 weeks. Result(s): Most patients (95%) received both radiation and chemotherapy according to protocol. Toxicity was manageable with grade III mucositis and pharyngeal-oesophageal toxicity in 85 and 50% of patients, respectively. Haematological toxicity was mild. Four patients (4%) died due to complications. With a median follow of 41 months, median overall survival and time to progression were 27 and 25 months, respectively.

2544,"Human mononuclear cell in vitro activation in microgravity and post-spaceflight. The results of postflight and inflight human in vitro lymphocyte experiments have been reviewed. The cumulative data indicate that mitogen-stimulated T-cell proliferation is blunted following short-duration missions. Since similar responses may also be obtained following exposure to non-spaceflight stressors (hypoxia and academic stress), it is unclear if microgravity per se aggravates this response. Our studies indicate that stress-induced impaired PHA- and PWM-stimulated activation can be detected within the first 24 hours in culture at the level of protein synthesis. While the mechanism for neuroendocrine-mediated blunted mitogen stimulated T cell proliferation has not been elucidated, it is not aggravated by autologous plasma and does not require changes in mononuclear cell subpopulations. While prior studies indicate lymphocyte activation is influenced by altering G forces on in vitro cultures, impaired cellular interactions or suboptimal microenvironments related to reduced cell densities in microgravity may contribute to the greatly impaired mitogen stimulated proliferation responses observed on Spacelab flights. It will be necessary to perform lymphocyte functional assays on crewmembers during spaceflight to determine to contribution of microgravity per se on altered human immune competence.",Excluded,0.039776187
2545,"Low sensitivity of the sister chromatid exchange assay to detect the genotoxic effects of radioiodine therapy. To assess the genotoxic risk associated with 131I therapy, sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and cells with unusually high SCE counts (HFC) were determined in a follow-up study performed with 46 hyperthyroidism and 39 thyroid cancer patients treated with 131I. In addition, a crosssectional study was also carried out with 78 control persons and 51 thyroid cancer patients that had completed radioiodine therapy from 1 to 6 years prior to the current investigation. In the follow-up analysis, the study was conducted over time and four blood samples were drawn from each patient: the first one prior to the radioiodine treatment, with the remaining three taken sequentially over the year after therapy. Concerning the results obtained for the whole population in the follow-up study, the SCE and HFC values found after radioiodine therapy did not show any significant increase, neither in the hyperthyroidism nor thyroid cancer groups. Unlike the results mentioned above, when the effect of smoking habit was considered, there was a slight but significant increase in SCE in the samples taken 3 months and 1 week after 131I therapy in the hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer non-smokers, respectively. The data obtained in the cross-sectional study did not show differences in SCE and HFC between the control group and the cancer group treated with 131I. It is noteworthy that among the different parameters analysed, smoking habit is the only factor that showed a direct relationship with SCE and HFC and, as a consequence, smokers had significantly more SCE and HFC than nonsmokers. Taking into account our previous investigations showing a highly significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei for the same patients and sampling times, the outcomes obtained would suggest that the eventual genotoxic effect of 131I therapy could not be dearly detected by the SCE assay. This would reinforce the view that ionizing radiation appears to be a poor inducer of SCEs.",Excluded,0.9707079
2546,"Detection of pulmonary embolism with combined ventilation-perfusion SPECT and low-dose CT: head-to-head comparison with multidetector CT angiography. UNLABELLED: The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is usually established by a combination of clinical assessment, D-dimer testing, and imaging with either pulmonary ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy or pulmonary multidetector CT (MDCT) angiography. Both V/Q SPECT and MDCT angiography seem to have high diagnostic accuracy. However, only limited data directly comparing these 2 modalities are available. Hybrid gamma-camera/MDCT systems have been introduced and allow simultaneous 3-dimensional lung V/Q SPECT and MDCT angiography, suitable for diagnosing PE. The aim of our study was to compare, in a prospective design, the diagnostic ability of V/Q SPECT, V/Q SPECT combined with low-dose CT, and pulmonary MDCT angiography obtained simultaneously using a combined SPECT/MDCT scanner in patients suspected of having PE., METHODS: Consecutive patients from June 2006 to February 2008 suspected of having acute PE were referred to the Department of Nuclear Medicine at Rigshospitalet or Frederiksberg Hospital, Denmark, for V/Q SPECT as a first-line imaging procedure. The number of eligible patients was 196. Patients with positive D-dimer results (>0.5 mmol/mL) or a clinical assessment with a Wells score greater than 2 were included and underwent V/Q SPECT, low-dose CT, and pulmonary MDCT angiography in a single session. Patient follow-up was 6 mo., RESULTS: A total of 81 simultaneous studies were available for analysis, of which 38% were from patients with PE. V/Q SPECT had a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 88%. When low-dose CT was added, the sensitivity was still 97% and the specificity increased to 100%. Perfusion SPECT with low-dose CT had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 51%. MDCT angiography alone had a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 100%., CONCLUSION: We conclude that V/Q SPECT in combination with low-dose CT without contrast enhancement has an excellent diagnostic performance and should therefore probably be considered first-line imaging in the work-up of PE in most cases.",Excluded,0.03811083
2547,"Use of irradiated bone graft for impaction grafting in acetabular revision surgery: a review of fifty consecutive cases. Impaction bone grafting is a useful technique in the armament of a revision hip surgeon. Traditionally fresh frozen allograft has been used for this technique. However there are concerns about the transmission of viral proteins and prions through this form of allograft. As a result irradiated bone graft has been favoured in some centres. There is no long term series describing the results of impaction bone grafting using irradiated bone. This paper reviews a consecutive series of 50 cases of acetabular revision surgery performed between 1995 and 2001 and followed up over a mean period of 45 months. The preoperative bone defect was graded by the Paprosky classification. There were 2 cases of type 1a, 9 type 2a, 15 type 2b, 7 type 2c, 10 type 3a and 7 type 3b. All cases were followed up clinically and radiologically. Case notes were reviewed for primary prosthesis, operative details and reason for revision. The radiographs were evaluated for signs of bone incorporation, remodelling, loosening and migration of the acetabular component. There were 5 cases of aseptic loosening at the end of the follow up period. One patient had recurrent dislocation and was revised. 20 cases (40%) showed changes suggestive of bone incorporation, while only 3 cases (6%) showed remodelling. Clinically a good or excellent outcome with absence of pain was achieved in 35 patients (70%). The results suggested that acetabular impaction bone grafting using irradiated bone graft is comparable to fresh frozen allograft. The low percentage of remodelling remains a concern and warrants further studies.",Excluded,0.04532415

Venous stenting has been shown to effectively treat iliofemoral venous obstruction with good short- and mid-term results. The aim of this study was to investigate long-term clinical outcome and stent patency. Twenty patients were treated with venous stenting for benign disease at our institution between 1987 and 2005. Fifteen of 20 patients (15 female, mean age at time of stent implantation 38 years [range 18-66]) returned for a clinical visit, a plain X-ray of the stent, and a Duplex ultrasound. Four patients were lost to follow-up, and one patient died 277 months after stent placement although a good clinical result was documented 267 months after stent placement. Mean follow-up after stent placement was 167.8 months (13.9 years) (range 71 (6 years) to 267 months [22 years]). No patient needed an additional venous intervention after stent implantation. No significant difference between the circumference of the thigh on the stented side (mean 55.1 cm [range 47.0-70.0]) compared with the contralateral thigh (mean 54.9 cm [range 47.0-70.0]) (p = 0.684) was seen. There was a nonsignificant trend toward higher flow velocities within the stent (mean 30.8 cm/s [range 10.0-48.0]) and the corresponding vein segment on the contralateral side (mean 25.2 cm/s [range 12.0-47.0]) (p = 0.065). Stent integrity was confirmed in 14 of 15 cases. Only one stent showed a fracture, as documented on x-ray, without any impairment of flow.

2550,"Outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for foramen magnum meningiomas: an international multicenter study. OBJECTIVE Meningiomas are the most common benign extramedullary lesions of the foramen magnum; however, their optimal management remains undefined. Given their location, foramen magnum meningiomas (FMMs) can cause significant morbidity, and complete microsurgical removal can be challenging. Anterior and anterolateral FMMs carry greater risks with surgery, but they comprise the majority of these lesions. As an alternative to resection, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been used to treat FMMs in small case series. To more clearly define the outcomes of SRS and to delineate a rational management paradigm for these lesions, the authors analyzed the safety and efficacy of SRS for FMM in an international multicenter trial. METHODS Seven medical centers participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation (IGKRF) provided data for this retrospective cohort study. Patients who were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery and whose clinical and radiological follow-up was longer than 6 months were eligible for study inclusion. Data from pre- and post-SRS radiological and clinical evaluations were analyzed. Stereotactic radiosurgery treatment variables were recorded. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients (39 females and 18 males, with a median age of 64 years) met the study inclusion criteria. Thirty-two percent had undergone prior microsurgical resection. Patients most frequently presented with cranial neuropathy (39%), headache (35%), numbness (32%), and ataxia (30%). Median pre-SRS tumor volume was 2.9 cm3. Median SRS margin dose was 12.5 Gy (range 10-16 Gy). At the last follow-up after SRS, 49% of tumors were stable, 44% had regressed, and 7% had progressed. Progression-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were each 92%. A greater margin dose was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of tumor regression, with 53% of tumors treated with > 12 Gy regressing. Fifty-two percent of symptomatic patients noted some clinical improvement. Adverse radiation effects were limited to hearing loss and numbness in 1 patient (2%). CONCLUSIONS Stereotactic radiosurgery for FMM frequently results in tumor control or tumor regression, as well as symptom improvement. Margin doses > 12 Gy were associated with increased rates of tumor regression. Stereotactic radiosurgery was generally safe and well tolerated. Given its risk-benefit profile, SRS may be particularly useful in the management of small- to moderate-volume anterior and anterolateral FMMs.",Excluded,0.18031271
2551,"Inhomogeneity of pulmonary ventilation during sustained microgravity as determined by single-breath washouts. Gravity is known to cause inhomogeneity of ventilation. Nongravitational factors are also recognized, but their relative contribution is not understood. We therefore studied ventilatory inhomogeneity during sustained microgravity during the 9-day flight of Spacelab SLS-1. All seven crew members performed single-breath nitrogen washouts. They inspired a vital capacity breath of 100% oxygen with a bolus of argon at the start of inspiration, and the inspiratory and expiratory flow rates were controlled at 0.5 l/s. Control measurements in normal gravity (1 G) were made pre- and postflight in the standing and supine position. Compared with the standing 1-G measurements, there was a marked decrease in ventilatory inhomogeneity during microgravity, as evidenced by the significant reductions in cardiogenic oscillations, slope of phase III, and height of phase IV for nitrogen and argon. However, argon phase IV volume was not reduced, and considerable ventilatory inhomogeneity remained. For example, the heights of the cardiogenic oscillations during microgravity for nitrogen and argon were 44 and 24%, respectively, of their values at 1 G, whereas the slopes of phase III for nitrogen and argon were 78 and 29%, respectively, of those at 1 G. The presence of a phase IV in microgravity is strong evidence that airway closure still occurs in the absence of gravity. The results were qualitatively similar to those found previously during short periods of 0 G in parabolic flight.",Excluded,0.038629405
2552,"Is multidetector CT-based bone mineral density and quantitative bone microstructure assessment at the spine still feasible using ultra-low tube current and sparse sampling?. OBJECTIVE: Osteoporosis diagnosis using multidetector CT (MDCT) is limited to relatively high radiation exposure. We investigated the effect of simulated ultra-low-dose protocols on in-vivo bone mineral density (BMD) and quantitative trabecular bone assessment., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained. Twelve subjects with osteoporotic vertebral fractures and 12 age- and gender-matched controls undergoing routine thoracic and abdominal MDCT were included (average effective dose: 10 mSv). Ultra-low radiation examinations were achieved by simulating lower tube currents and sparse samplings at 50%, 25% and 10% of the original dose. BMD and trabecular bone parameters were extracted in T10-L5., RESULTS: Except for BMD measurements in sparse sampling data, absolute values of all parameters derived from ultra-low-dose data were significantly different from those derived from original dose images (p<0.05). BMD, apparent bone fraction and trabecular thickness were still consistently lower in subjects with than in those without fractures (p<0.05)., CONCLUSION: In ultra-low-dose scans, BMD and microstructure parameters were able to differentiate subjects with and without vertebral fractures, suggesting osteoporosis diagnosis is feasible. However, absolute values differed from original values. BMD from sparse sampling appeared to be more robust. This dose-dependency of parameters should be considered for future clinical use., KEY POINTS: * BMD and quantitative bone parameters are assessable in ultra-low-dose in vivo MDCT scans. * Bone mineral density does not change significantly when sparse sampling is applied. * Quantitative trabecular bone microstructure measurements are sensitive to dose reduction. * Osteoporosis subjects could be differentiated even at 10% of original dose. * Radiation exposure should be considered when comparing quantitative bone parameters.",Excluded,0.03884722
2553,"The early causal influence of cell size upon synaptic number: the mutant gigas of Drosophila. The number of synaptic contacts formed by a neuron is known to vary with its surface area. This could be because large neurons are able to establish more synaptic sites, or because those neurons that are able to establish more sites are subsequently able to enlarge. To test between these two possibilities clones of enlarged ommatidia were generated in the retina of the Drosophila mutant gigas, by mitotic recombination following gamma-irradiation in the third-instar larva. The numbers of afferent synaptic contacts formed by the photoreceptor terminals in the first optic neuropil, or lamina, were then counted in the adult. The terminals of mutant photoreceptors were also enlarged, but by varying degrees. The sizes of their profiles in single sections merged with the size distribution of terminals having a wild-type phenotype, lying outside the clone in the same lamina. A perimeter of 6.0 microns for the profiles of receptor terminal in cross section was established as a criterion for distinguishing between normal and mutant phenotypes. The mutant terminals had more presynaptic sites. Because only the gigas terminals are mutant and because they enlarged at a time long before synapse formation occurred in the lamina we may conclude that cell enlargement preceded elevated synaptic number. The increase in synaptic number roughly matched the increased membrane surface of the terminals, so as nearly to preserve a constant areal density of synaptic sites over a 5-fold range in synaptic frequency.",Excluded,0.26485577

Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of DSA and kinetic image pairs were compared. Visual quality comparisons were also performed by specialists who used an online questionnaire. Interrater agreement was characterized by percent agreement and Fleiss k. Results A total of 1902 regions of interest were carefully selected in 110 image pairs to calculate and compare the SNRs. Median SNR in raw kinetic images was 3.3-fold and 2.3-fold higher than raw and postprocessed DSA images, respectively. A total of 232 pairs of raw and postprocessed kinetic images were compared. It was indicated that postprocessing improved the quality of kinetic images in 63.9% (2668 of 4176) of the comparisons. Interrater agreement was 75% and Fleiss k was 0.12 (P < .001). Also, 238 pairs of kinetic and DSA images were compared. Kinetic imaging was judged to have provided higher quality images than DSA in 69.0% (2462 of 3570) of the comparisons. The interrater agreement was 81% and Fleiss k was 0.17 (P < .001). Conclusion Kinetic imaging helps to view the same structures as digital subtraction angiography but offers better image quality.

2558,"Is the paradise in the Caribbean? Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in HIV+ patients treated at a clinic in Puerto Rico. Background: Existent studies have demonstrated that HIV+ population suffer from low bone density, increasing their risk of fractures, which has been linked to the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and even HIV itself. Currently, there aren't studies published regarding vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in HIV+ patients in the Caribbean (latitude 18degree00N 66degree37W). Our hypothesis is that HIV+ patients with or without HAART who live in the Caribbean have 25-hydroxyvitamin D severe deficiency (<=25 nmol/l), deficiency (<=50 nmol/l) or insufficiency (>50 nmol/l <=75 nmol/l). Methodology: A retrospective chart review was conducted among files from HIV+ adults >49 year managed at private clinic. A data collection tool was designed to gather demographic characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), vitamin D levels, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), viral load, CD4 cell count, 25-OHD levels, time with HIV infection (date of diagnosis), AIDS defining illness, current or former IVDU, tobacco use, current ARV therapy (PI or NNRTI based), time on ARV (number of years since first ARV regimen), co-morbid conditions, multivitamin use, vitamin D supplementation used and dose, and other medications. Result(s): All patients were Hispanic, 62.8% men, and mean age was 57 years. Twenty-two patients (51%) had deficient/insufficient vitamin D levels vs 21 patients (49%) who had normal vitamin D levels. Among patients with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency, 95.5% were taking ART; 68% were on a PI based regimen, and 32% on a non-PI based regimen. Eighteen patients (82%) with deficient/insufficient vitamin D levels had a BMI<30 vs 4 patients (18%) with a BMI>30. Ten patients (46%) with deficient/insufficient levels had a total daily intake of <=800 IU of vitamin D vs 6 patients (27%) which were taking a total daily intake of >800 IU of vitamin D; 6 (27%) patients with deficient/ insufficient levels were not taking any vitamin D supplementation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of sonography for this purpose., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We attempted 26 sonographically guided biopsies of five abdominal, six pelvic, and 12 retroperitoneal lymph nodes in 23 patients. The patients included 19 women and four men who were 26-76 years old (mean, 50 years old). The nodes were less than 2 cm in 16 patients, 2-3 cm in four patients, and greater than 3 cm in three patients. Biopsies were considered successful if the nodes could be visualized and biopsied using sonographic guidance and the pathologist's final report indicated that the tissue specimens obtained were adequate for diagnosis. The length of the procedures and the number of complications were recorded., RESULTS: Lymph nodes were visualized and biopsied with sonographic guidance in 23 (88%) of the 26 attempts. Three biopsies could not be performed with sonography because of poor visualization of the nodes. Adequate tissue for cytologic or histologic evaluation was obtained in 21 (91%) of the 23 sonographically guided procedures. In the 21 successful procedures, clinical and imaging follow-up showed no evidence of false-negative diagnoses. The time from the placement of the patient in the interventional sonography room to completion of the procedure ranged from 25 to 60 min (mean, 35 min) for sonographically guided biopsies. We had no procedure-related complications., CONCLUSION: Sonography is an accurate and safe guidance technique for lymph node biopsies in the abdomen, pelvis, and retroperitoneum. This technique is efficacious for deep nodes as small as 1 cm in diameter. The advantages of sonography over CT include no need for ionizing radiation, portability, shorter procedure time, and real-time visualization of the needle throughout the procedure. These advantages, and the fact that sonography costs less than CT, suggest that sonography is a more appropriate guidance technique in this era of cost containment.",Excluded,0.038624473
2560,"Chest Computed Tomography Radiation Dose Optimization: Comparison of Automatic Exposure Control Strength Curves. PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to compare radiation dose and image quality between the ""average"" and the ""very strong"" automatic exposure control (AEC) strength curves., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Images reconstructed with filtered back-projection techniques and radiation dose data of unenhanced helical chest computed tomography (CT) examinations obtained at 2 hospitals (hospital A, hospital B) using the same scanner devices and acquisition protocols but different AEC strength curves were evaluated over a 3-month period. The selected AEC strength curve applied to ""slim"" patients (diameter <32 cm estimated from the attenuation automatically measured on the topogram) was ""average"" and ""very strong"" in hospital A and hospital B, respectively. Two radiologists with 13 and 24 years of experience scored the image quality of the lung parenchyma and the mediastinum on a 5-point scale. The patients' effective diameter, the delivered CT dose index volume, and dose-length products were recorded., RESULTS: A total of 410 patients were included. The average body mass index was 24.0 kg/m in hospital A and 24.8 kg/m in hospital B. There was no significant difference between hospitals with respect to age, sex ratio, weight, height, body mass index, effective diameters, and image quality scores for each radiologist (P ranging from 0.050 to 1.000). The mean CT dose index volume for the entire population was 2.0 mGy and was significantly lower in hospital B with the ""very strong"" AEC curve as compared with hospital A (-11%, P=0.001). The mean dose-length product delivered in this 70 kg-weight population was 68 mGy cm, corresponding to an effective dose of 0.95 mSv., CONCLUSION: Changing the AEC strength curve from ""average"" to ""very strong"" for slim patients maintains image quality and reduces the radiation dose to <1 mSv in routine chest CT examinations reconstructed with filtered back-projection techniques.",Excluded,0.038272854
2561,"The effect of caffeine on repair systems in oocytes of Drosophila melanogaster. II. The induction of chromosome aberrations in irradiated males. Irradiated males were mated to females that had received treatment with caffeine or honey (by feeding), and the frequencies of sex chromosome losses and chromosome rearrangements induced in mature spermatozoa of the males were compared. Caffeine treatment led to an enhancement of the frequencies of sex chromosome loss and a decrease in those of rearrangements. These findings can be interpreted on the assumption that caffeine inhibits repair and misrepair processes that are active in the oocytes. Caffeine treatment administered to one of the female stocks used in these studies was without any effect, presumably because of the absence of a caffeine sensitive repair mechanism in the oocytes.",Excluded,0.077549495
2562,"Radiation exposure from computed tomography in blunt trauma patients. Methods. Using data from our hospital information system, we selected patients assigned a trauma code, according to the Korean Standard Classification of Diseases, and with three or more body lesions assessed by CT at the same time in the emergency department. Each CT conducted was categorized into 'CT related to the final diagnosis' or 'CT unrelated to final diagnosis'. The characteristics and estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to the final diagnosis were analyzed. The factors affecting the estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to final diagnosis were investigated., Results. More than half of all CT examinations were not associated with the final diagnosis. The additional estimated effective dose due to CTs being unrelated to the final diagnosis in each patient was a sufficient amount of radiation exposure to increase the possibility of fatal cancer., Introduction. Computed tomography (CT) has many diagnostic advantages, spurring growth in the number of CT examinations. As the use of CT increases, the potential for radiation-induced adverse effects has become an issue. The primary objective of this study was to assess the liberal use of CT induced radiation exposure in patients with multiple blunt traumas. The secondary objective was to investigate the factors affecting the estimated effective dose resulting from CTs unrelated to final diagnosis., Conclusion. A considerable number of CT scans were unrelated to the patient's final diagnosis, which exposes the patient to additional radiation exposure.Copyright ©, Pharmamed Mado Ltd.

2563,"Effect of selective inhibitors of inflammation on oral mucositis: preclinical studies. OBJECTIVE: Oral mucositis is a severe, dose-limiting side effect of radio(chemo)therapy for head and neck tumors. The epithelial radiation response (ulceration) is accompanied by inflammatory changes. Their interaction with the epithelial processes remains unclear. The present study was initiated to determine the effect of inhibition of TNF-alpha or COX-2 on the epithelial radiation response in the mouse tongue model., METHODS: Daily fractionated irradiation was given with 5 x 3 Gy/week over one (days 0-4) or two weeks (days 0-4, 7-11). Each protocol was terminated by graded test doses (5 dose groups, 10 animals each) to a defined area of the lower tongue surface to generate full dose-effect curves for mucosal ulceration. A TNF-alpha inhibiting antibody (Infliximab) or a COX-2 inhibitor (Celecoxib) was administered., RESULTS: No effect of Infliximab or Celecoxib was found in any of the protocols. Isoeffective doses for ulcer induction were unchanged. Also, the time course of the response was largely unaffected., CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of TNF-alpha or COX-2, two dominating inflammatory pathways, did not result in modulation of the response of oral epithelium during fractionated irradiation. This suggests that the inflammatory changes mediated through TNF-alpha or COX-2 are not relevant for the epithelial radiation response of oral mucosa.",Excluded,0.844013

This is an analysis of 34 patients with carcinoma of the cervical esophagus treated with radiation therapy with curative intent at the University of Florida between September 1966 and May 1985. All patients have a minimum 2-year follow-up and 28 (82%) have at least 5 years of follow-up. Patients were staged according to the recommendations of the AJCC. Patients who died within 2 years of treatment with the primary site continuously disease-free were excluded from the local control analysis; all patients were included in the analysis of complications and survival. Irradiation resulted in control of the primary lesion in 1 of 2 patients who presented with T1 lesions, in 4 of the 12 patients with T2 lesions, and 3 of 17 patients who presented with T3 lesions. One patient with a T3 lesion that recurred locally was successfully salvaged by an operation.

2565,"Imaging Findings Within the First 12 Months of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated With Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy. Purpose: To correlate the imaging findings of treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with explant pathology and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response. Methods and Materials: From 2007 to 2015, of 146 patients treated with liver SBRT for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A hepatocellular carcinoma, 10 were identified with inclusion criteria and had regular interval follow-up magnetic resonance imaging/triple phase computed tomography and explant pathology or declining AFP values for radiology-pathology response correlation. Reference standards for successful response were >90% necrosis on explant pathology or pretreatment AFP >75 ng/mL normalizing to <10 ng/mL within 1 year after SBRT without other treatment. Subjects were treated with 24 to 50 Gy in 3 to 5 fractions. Multiphasic magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after SBRT was compared with pretreatment imaging by 2 expert radiologists. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Result(s): There were 10 subjects with 10 treated HCCs, classified as 3 Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) 5a, 4 OPTN 5b, and 3 OPTN 5x. All had successfully treated HCCs, according to explant pathology or declining AFP. Four of 10 HCCs had persistent central arterial hyperenhancement 3 to 12 months after SBRT; persistent wash-out was common up to 12 months (9 of 10). Of 10 treated HCCs, 9 exhibited decreased size at 12 months. Liver parenchyma adjacent to the lesion showed early (3-6 months) hyperemia followed by late (6-12 months) capsular retraction and delayed enhancement. No patient had a significant decline in liver function. Conclusion(s): In the absence of increasing size, persistent central arterial hyperenhancement and wash-out can occur within the first 12 months after SBRT in successfully treated HCCs and may not represent residual viable tumor. Liver parenchyma adjacent to the treated lesion showed inflammation followed by fibrosis, without significant change in hepatic function. Until a radiologic signature of tumor control is determined, freedom from local progression seems to be the best measure of HCC control after SBRT.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.041934505

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and clinical findings of radiation retinopathy after single-fraction high-dose gamma knife radiosurgery for choroidal melanoma., DESIGN: Retrospective noncomparative interventional case series., PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two patients with choroidal melanoma., METHODS: Review of charts, color fundus photographs, and fluorescein angiograms of 32 choroidal melanoma patients after radiosurgery. All patients were treated with the Leksell gamma knife in one fraction with a marginal dose between 40 and 80 Gy (median, 50 Gy) and were followed for at least 24 months (or until enucleation because of complications secondary to radiation)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Any clinical feature of radiation retinopathy and neovascular glaucoma., RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 38 months (range, 6-81 months) we found radiation retinopathy in 84% of our patients. The most common findings in these patients were intraretinal hemorrhages with an incidence of 70%, macular edema and capillary nonperfusion in 63%, and hard exudates in 52% of the patients. Less common were microaneurysms in 30% and retinal neovascularization in 22%. The time of onset of the various radiation-associated retinal findings ranged between 1 and 22 months. Forty-seven percent of all patients developed neovascular glaucoma.

2567,"Impact of Significant Coronary Artery Calcification Reported on Low-Dose Computed Tomography Lung Cancer Screening. BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a common and important incidental finding in low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) performed for lung cancer screening (LCS). The impact of these incidental findings on patient management is unclear., PURPOSE: The goals of our study were to determine the impact of reporting CAC on patient management and to determine whether standardized reporting of CAC affects the likelihood of future interventions., METHODS: In this IRB-approved retrospective study, we queried our LCS database for reports of LDCT performed between January 2016 and September 2018. All reports with significant findings of CAC designated with the letter ""S"" for any Lung-RADS category were selected. The grading of CAC was extracted from the reports. Medical records were reviewed for each patient to determine demographics, clinical history, medications, and cardiac-related diagnostic and interventional procedures. The changes in management after the report of significant CAC on LDCT were documented. Statistical analysis with Student t test and Pearson chi test was performed., RESULTS: A total of 756/3110 patients (mean age: 67+/-6.4 y; M=466, 61.6%: F=290, 38.4%) were reported to have significant CAC on LDCT for LCS. Of them, 236/756 patients (31.2%) had established coronary artery disease (CAD) at baseline, before the initial LDCT. A change in management was observed in 155/756 patients (20.5%). The most common changes in management included the following: alteration in medication regimen (n=114/155, 73.5%), stress testing (n=65/155, 41.9%), and referral to a cardiologist (36/155, 23.2%). Percutaneous coronary intervention (4, 2.6%) and surgery (3, 1.9%) were uncommon. Changes in management were more common in those without established CAD and in those whose CAC was semiquantitatively graded (35% vs. 25%, P=0.02)., CONCLUSION: CAC is a common significant finding in LDCT for LCS.

2568,"Pilot study trialling a new ambulatory method for the clinical assessment of regional gastrointestinal transit using multiple electromagnetic capsules. BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) motor disorders often involve several regions of the GI tract. Therefore, easy and safe assessment of whole gut and regional motility is valuable for more precise diagnosis. 3D-Transit is a novel method for ambulatory evaluation of total and regional gastrointestinal transit times (GITT) based on the anatomical localization of ingestible electromagnetic capsules. The main purpose of this study was to test the performance of the 3D-Transit system., METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers each ingested three electromagnetic capsules over a period of two consecutive days. Standard radio-opaque markers (ROM) were also ingested to assess the agreement between total GITT obtained with both methods., KEY RESULTS: Investigations were well-tolerated and three capsules could be tracked simultaneously with minimal data loss (Capsule 1: median: 0.2% of time (range 0-25.3%). Region specific contraction patterns were identified and used for computation of total and regional GITT in all subjects. Inter-observer agreement was 100% for total GITT (median variation 0%) but less for regional GITT. Day-to-day and diurnal variations were significant for total and regional GITT. Total GITT assessed by 3D-Transit capsules were moderately well-correlated to those assessed with standard ROM (Spearman's rho = 0.7)., CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: 3D-transit is a well-tolerated and minimal invasive ambulatory method for assessment of GI motility. By providing both total and regional transit times, the 3D-Transit system holds great promise for future clinical studies of GI function in health and disease.

2569,"A proteomic analysis of Helicoverpa armigera adults after exposure to UV light irradiation. Ultraviolet (UV) light (blacklight), which emits UV in the range of 320-400 nm, has been used worldwide in light trapping of insect pests. To gain a better understanding of the response of Helicoverpa armigera adults to UV light irradiation, we carried out a comparative proteomic analysis. Three-day-old adults were exposed to UV light for 1 h. Total proteins were extracted and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. More than 1200 protein spots were reproducibly detected, including 12 that were more abundant and 21 less abundant. Mass spectrometry analysis and database searching helped us to identify 29 differentially abundant proteins. The identified proteins were categorized into several functional groups including signal transduction, RNA processing, protein processing, stress response, metabolisms, and cytoskeleton structure, etc. This study is the first analysis of differentially expressed proteins in phototactic insects under UV light irradiation conditions and gives new insights into the adaptation mechanisms responsive to UV light irradiation stress. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To determine the therapeutic efficacy and safety of risk-adapted stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) schedules for patients with early-stage central and ultra-central inoperable non-small cell lung cancer. From 2006 to 2015, 80 inoperable T1-2N0M0 NSCLC patients were treated with two median dose levels: 60 Gy in six fractions (range, 48-60 Gy in 4-8 fractions) prescribed to the 74% isodose line (range, 58%-79%) for central lesions (ie within 2 cm of, but not abutting, the proximal bronchial tree; n = 43), and 56 Gy in seven fractions (range, 48-60 Gy in 5-10 fractions) prescribed to the 74% isodose line (range, 60%-80%) for ultra-central lesions (ie abutting the proximal bronchial tree; n = 37) on consecutive days. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), tumor local control rate (LC), and toxicity. Median OS and PFS were 64.47 and 32.10 months (respectively) for ultra-central patients, and not reached for central patients. Median time to local failure, regional failure, and any distant failures for central versus ultra-central lesions were: 27.37 versus 26.07 months, 20.90 versus 12.53 months, and 20.85 versus 15.53 months, respectively, all P <.05. Multivariate analyses showed that tumor categorization (ultra-central) and planning target volume >=52.76 mL were poor prognostic factors of OS, PFS, and LC, respectively (all P <.05). There was one grade 5 toxicity; all other toxicities were grade 1-2. Our results showed that ultra-central tumors have a poor OS, PFS, and LC compared with central patients because of the use of risk-adapted SBRT schedules that allow for equal and favorable toxicity profiles.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

2572,"Combined modality therapy including intraoperative electron irradiation for locally recurrent colorectal cancer. Purpose: To evaluate survival, relapse patterns, and prognostic factors in patients with colorectal cancer relapse treated with curative-intent therapy, including intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT). Methods and Materials: From April 1981 through January 2008, 607 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer received IOERT as a component of treatment. IOERT was preceded or followed by external radiation (median dose, 45.5 Gy) in 583 patients (96%). Resection was classified as R0 in 227 (37%), R1 in 224 (37%), and R2 in 156 (26%). The median IOERT dose was 15 Gy (range, 7.5-30 Gy). Result(s): Median overall survival was 36 months. Five- and 10-year survival rates were 30% and 16%, respectively. Survival estimates at 5 years were 46%, 27%, and 16% for R0, R1, and R2 resection, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that R0 resection, no prior chemotherapy, and more recent treatment (in the second half of the series) were associated with improved survival. The 3-year cumulative incidence of central, local, and distant relapse was 12%, 23%, and 49%, respectively. Central and local relapse were more common in previously irradiated patients and in those with subtotal resection. Toxicity Grade 3 or higher partially attributable to IOERT was observed in 66 patients (11%). Neuropathy was observed in 94 patients (15%) and was more common with IOERT doses exceeding 12.5 Gy. Conclusion(s): Long-term survival and disease control was achievable in patients with locally recurrent colorectal cancer. Continued evaluation of curative-intent, combined-modality therapy that includes IOERT is warranted in this high-risk population. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. Printed in the USA.

2573,"Comparison of lung lesion biopsies between low-dose CT-guided and conventional CT-guided techniques. The low-dose computed tomography (CT) technique has been widely used because it decreases the potential risk of radiation exposure, as well as enabling low-dose CT-guided lung lesion biopsy. However, uncertainties remain regarding diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, complication rate, and image quality. To compare the diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, complication rate, and image quality of lung lesion biopsy between conventional CT-guided and low-dose CT-guided techniques. A total of 90 patients were prospectively enrolled and randomized into two groups (group A: 120 kv; 200 mA; thickness, 2.0 mm; pitch, 16 mm/rot; n = 44; group B: 120 kv;10 mA; thickness, 2.0 mm; pitch, 23 mm/rot; n = 46). Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), radiation dose, image quality, and complication rate were compared. All variables between the two groups were analyzed using chi-square and Student's t tests. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for diagnosing lung lesions were 96.88%, 100%, 97.5%, 100%, and 88.89% in group A, respectively.

2575,"Thyroid function is not associated with brown adipose tissue volume and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in young euthyroid adults. PURPOSE: Thyroid hormones (THs) are important mediators of brown adipose tissue (BAT) differentiation. However, the association of TH concentrations with human BAT is unclear. The present work examines the associations between circulating thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and THs concentrations (i.e. free tri-iodothyronine, FT3, and free thyroxine, FT4), under thermoneutral [22-23C] and cold-induced conditions, and BAT volume, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake and mean radiodensity. METHOD(S): A total of 106 young healthy, euthyroid adults (34 men/72 women; 22.0 +/- 2.1 years old; 24.9 +/- 4.6 kg/m2) participated in this cross-sectional study. BAT volume, 18F-FDG uptake and mean radiodensity were assessed after 2 h of personalized (i.e., contemplating each individual's shivering threshold) cold exposure via positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET/CT) static scanning. TSH and THs levels were determined before (thermoneutral) and 1 h after the cold exposure. RESULT(S): Cold exposure increased circulating FT4 (P=0.038) and reduced of TSH levels (P<=0.001). Conversely, the FT3 serum concentration was not modified by cold exposure (P=0.435). No associations were found between the TSH and THs thermoneutral (all P>0.289) or cold-induced levels (all P>0.067) and BAT volume,18F-FDG uptake and mean radiodensity.

2576,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopic study of radiogenic changes after radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations with implications for the differential diagnosis of radionecrosis. Background: The incidence of radionecrosis after radiosurgery is 5-20%. That radionecrosis after radiosurgery may be confused with a malignant tumor is a known phenomenon and problem. Method(s): Three similarly treated patients with cAVM, 1 patient with symptomatic radionecrosis and 2 patients with normal post-radiation MRI changes, were selected and studied in detail with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). 2 cAVM were located in eloquent locations and were classified as Spetzler-Martin grade (SM) III such that interdisciplinary radiosurgery was recommended; a third patient with a left frontal SM II cAVM refused surgery. 1 patient was male, and 2 were female. The patient's ages ranged from 38 to 62 years (median, 39 years). The nidus volume (= planning target volume = PTV) ranged from 2.75 to 6.89 ccm (median, 6.41 ccm). The single dose was 20 Gy at the isocenter of the PTV encompassing the 80 - 90% isodose. The median follow-up period was 20 months (range, 16 - 84 months). Toxicities were evaluated with the Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for adverse events version 3.0. Result(s): No patient suffered a bleeding from cAVM during the study period. A complete nidus occlusion was shown in all patients with time-resolved MRA. All patients showed radiogenic MRI changes, 1 patient showed excessive radionecrosis. This patient was oligosymptomatic and under temporary corticoid therapy symptoms resolved completely.Following patterns associated with radionecrosis in the MRS studies were identified in our collective:. * 2D spectroscopic imaging (2D-SI) revealed much lower concentrations of metabolites in the lesion as compared to contralateral healthy tissue in all patients.* Whereas regions with regular post-radiosurgery effects showed almost normal levels of Cho and a Cho/Cr ratio < 2.0, regions with radionecrosis were characterized by increased lipid levels and a Cho/Cr ratio > 2.0 in conjunction with decreased absolute levels of all metabolites, especially of Cr and NAA. Conclusion(s): MRS is an increasingly valuable tool for the differential diagnosis of radiation reactions. Specific patterns of MRS spectra in radionecrosis were identified; in synopsis with clinical parameters, these changes have to be taken into account to avoid misdiagnosis. © 2013 Bostrom et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded,0.042842582
2577,"Accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy combined with induction and concomitant chemotherapy for inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer: Impact of total treatment time. Tumour cell proliferation during conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (RT) can negatively influence the treatment outcome in patients with unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Accelerated and hyperfractionated RT may therefore have an advantage over conventional RT. Moreover, earlier studies have suggested improved survival with addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CT). We present here the results of combined treatment with induction and concomitant CT and accelerated hyperfractionated RT in a retrospective series of patients with advanced NSCLC. Between August 1990 and August 1995, 90 consecutive patients, aged 42-77 years (median 63 years), with locally advanced unresectable or medically inoperable NSCLC and good performance status were referred for treatment: stage: I 23%, IIIa 37%, IIIb 40%. Patients histologies included: squamous cell carcinoma 52%, adenocarcinoma 34% and large cell carcinoma 13%. The treatment consisted of two courses of CT (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 day 1- 3 i.v.), the second course given concomitantly with RT. The total RT dose was 61.2-64.6 Gy, with two daily fractions of 1.7 Gy. A one-week interval was introduced after 40.8 Gy to reduce acute toxicity, making the total treatment time 4.5 weeks. Concerning toxicity, 33 patients had febrile neutropenia, 10 patients suffered from grade III oesophagitis and 7 patients had grade III pneumonitis. There were two possible treatment-related deaths, one due to myocardial infarction and the other due to a pneumocystis carinii infection. The 1-, 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 72%, 46% and 34%, respectively; median survival was 21.3 months. Fifty-one patients had progressive disease: 21 failed locoregionally, 29 had distant metastases and 9 patients had a combination of these. Pretreatment weight loss was the only prognostic factor found, except for stage. However, the results for stage IIIb were no different from those for stage IIIa. We conclude that the survival results compare favourably with those of most other studies with a manageable toxicity.",Excluded,0.038184382

2579,"Cisplatin-based chemoradiation plus cetuximab in locally advanced head and neck cancer: A phase II clinical study. Background: Intensification of chemoradiation for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is unlikely due to toxicity. Cetuximab combined either with radiotherapy or with chemotherapy showed favourable toxic profile with positive results in both combinations. Therefore, cetuximab could intensify chemoradiation without worsening toxicity. We conducted a phase II study of chemoradiation and cetuximab. Patients and Methods: Eligible patients had stage III-IV M0 HNSCC. Treatment consisted of three cycles of cisplatin (20 mg/m2/day x 5 days) and fluorouracil (200 mg/m2/day x 5 days) rapidly alternated to three split courses of radiotherapy up to 70 Gy and concurrent weekly cetuximab. The primary end point of the study was complete response (CR) rate. Secondary end points were toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Fourty-five patients were enrolled: median age was 56 years, 38 had stage IV disease and 40 nodal involvement. CR occurred in 32 patients (71%). PFS and OS was 21+ months and 32.6+, respectively. Acute grade 3-4 toxic effects were in the expected range, but grade 3 radiodermatitis occurred in 33 patients. Conclusion(s): The combination of cetuximab, cisplatin, fluorouracil and radiotherapy leads to a very high proportion of CR and it is feasible with toxic effects similar to those expected by radiochemotherapy. The only unexpected toxicity was skin toxicity: grade 3 radiodermatitis occurred in 73% of the patients. © The Author 2010.

2580,"Clinical Outcomes of Image Guided Adaptive Hypofractionated Weekly Radiation Therapy for Bladder Cancer in Patients Unsuitable for Radical Treatment. Purpose and Objectives We report on the clinical outcomes of a phase 2 study assessing image guided hypofractionated weekly radiation therapy in bladder cancer patients unsuitable for radical treatment. Methods and Materials Fifty-five patients with T2-T4aNx-2M0-1 bladder cancer not suitable for cystectomy or daily radiation therapy treatment were recruited. A ""plan of the day"" radiation therapy approach was used, treating the whole (empty) bladder to 36 Gy in 6 weekly fractions. Acute toxicity was assessed weekly during radiation therapy, at 6 and 12 weeks using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. Late toxicity was assessed at 6 months and 12 months using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading. Cystoscopy was used to assess local control at 3 months. Cumulative incidence function was used to determine local progression at 1 at 2 years. Death without local progression was treated as a competing risk. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results Median age was 86 years (range, 68-97 years). Eighty-seven percent of patients completed their prescribed course of radiation therapy. Genitourinary and gastrointestinal grade 3 acute toxicity was seen in 18% (10/55) and 4% (2/55) of patients, respectively. No grade 4 genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity was seen. Grade >=3 late toxicity (any) at 6 and 12 months was seen in 6.5% (2/31) and 4.3% (1/23) of patients, respectively. Local control after radiation therapy was 92% of assessed patients (60% total population). Cumulative incidence of local progression at 1 year and 2 years for all patients was 7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2%-17%) and 17% (95% CI 8%-29%), respectively. Overall survival at 1 year was 63% (95% CI 48%-74%). Conclusion Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivered weekly with a plan of the day approach offers good local control with acceptable toxicity in a patient population not suitable for radical bladder treatment.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s)",Excluded,0.038905013
2581,"Clinical experience with a 3D surface patient setup system for alignment of partial-breast irradiation patients. Purpose: To assess the utility of surface imaging on patient setup for accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). Methods and Material: A photogrammetry system was used in parallel to APBI setup by laser and portal imaging. Surface data were acquired after laser and port-film setup for 9 patients. Surfaces were analyzed in comparison to a reference surface from the first treatment session by use of rigid transformations. The surface model after laser setup was used in a simulated photogrammetry setup procedure. In addition, breathing data were acquired by surface acquisition at a frame rate of 7 Hz. Result(s): Mean 3D displacement was 7.3 mm (SD, 4.4 mm) and 7.6 mm (SD, 4.2 mm) for laser and port film, respectively. Simulated setup with the photogrammetry system yielded mean displacement of 1 mm (SD, 1.2 mm). Distance analysis resulted in mean distances of 3.7 mm (SD, 4.9 mm), 4.3 mm (SD, 5.6 mm), and 1.6 mm (SD, 2.4 mm) for laser, port film, and photogrammetry, respectively. Breathing motion at isocenter was smaller than 3.7 mm, with a mean of 1.9 mm (SD, 1.1 mm). Conclusion(s): Surface imaging for PBI setup appears promising. Alignment of the 3D breast surface achieved by stereo-photogrammetry shows greater breast topology congruence than when patients are set up by laser or portal imaging. A correlation of breast surface and CTV must be quantitatively established. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.03852154
2582,"Stereotactic Gamma Knife surgery safety and efficacy in the management of symptomatic benign confined cavernous sinus meningioma. Background: Considering the proximity to cranial nerves from II to VI and the internal carotid artery microsurgery for cavernous sinus meningioma (CSM) has its limits of complete resection, with high potential tumor recurrences, cranial nerve and vascular morbidity. Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) is an advanced modality as primary treatment for patients harboring symptomatic benign confined CSM as well as adjuvant therapy to postoperative residual tumor giving a high rate of tumor control, stabilizing or even improving clinical condition with low morbidity. Material(s) and Method(s): The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GKS used in the management of 62 patients with symptomatic benign confined CSM < 3 cm in maximum diameters treated at the International Medical Centre (IMC), Cairo, Egypt, from 2005 to end of 2012, with mean follow-up period of 36 months (range, 24-96 months) by reviewing their clinical and radiological data. For 51 patients GKS was performed as a primary treatment. The diagnosis was based on typical clinical and imaging findings and in 11 patients GKS was used as adjuvant to post-operative tumor residual with histological confirmation. Result(s): There were 43 females and 19 males. The median age at the time of treatment was 48 years. The mean tumor volume was 5.7 cc, the mean tumor marginal radiation dose was 14.4 Gy, the mean isodose line was 38 %, and the mean tumor coverage was 94.4 %. The optic pathway received < 8 Gy and the brain stem < 10 Gy. At most recent follow-up, 57 patients (92 %) had stable or improved cranial nerve deficits. Post-GKS cranial nerve complications were detected in five patients (8 %). Tumor volume was controlled in 60 patients (96 %) at most recent follow-up MRI; 12 patients had a reduction in tumor size and 42 had stable tumor size, while tumor size progression was detected in two patients. The tumor progression-free survival at 3 and 5 years in 40 patients who completed at least 5 years of follow-up was 95 %. Conclusion(s): Gamma Knife surgery is a safe and effective option for the treatment of cavernous sinus meningioma not only as an adjuvant to surgery but also as an alternative to surgical removal in tumors confined mainly to the cavernous sinus.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Excluded,0.038509313
2583,"Variation in quantitative CT air trapping in heavy smokers on repeat CT examinations. Objectives: To determine the variation in quantitative computed tomography (CT) measures of air trapping in lowdose chest CTs of heavy smokers. Method(s): We analysed 45 subjects from a lung cancer screening trial, examined by CT twice within 3 months. Inspiratory and expiratory low-dose CT was obtained using breath hold instructions. CT air trapping was defined as the percentage of voxels in expiratory CT with an attenuation below -856 HU (EXP-856) and the expiratory to inspiratory ratio of mean lung density (E/I-ratio MLD). Variation was determined using limits of agreement, defined as 1.96 times the standard deviation of the mean difference. The effect of both lung volume correction and breath hold reproducibility was determined. Result(s): The limits of agreement for uncorrected CT air trapping measurements were -15.0 to 11.7 % (EXP-856) and -9.8 to 8.0 % (E/I-ratioMLD). Good breath hold reproducibility significantly narrowed the limits for EXP -856 (-10.7 to 7.5 %, P=0.002), but not for E/I-ratioMLD (-9.2 to 7.9 %, P=0.75). Statistical lung volume correction did not improve the limits for EXP-856 (-12.5 to 8.8 %, P=0.12) and E/Iratio MLD (-7.5 to 5.8 %, P=0.17). Conclusion(s): Quantitative air trapping measures on lowdose CT of heavy smokers show considerable variation on repeat CT examinations, regardless of lung volume correction or reproducible breath holds. Key Points: * Computed tomography quantitatively measures small airways disease in heavy smokers. * Measurements of air trapping vary considerably on repeat CT examinations. * Variation remains substantial even with reproducible breath holds and lung volume correction. © The Author(s) 2012.",Excluded,0.03888873
2584,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae may cause dyspnoea and hospitalisations in young healthy adults. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostics for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) from the respiratory tract has become widely available, but the interpretation of the results remains unclear. M. pneumoniae has been suggested to cause mainly mild and self-limiting infections or asymptomatic carriage. However, systematic analyses of the association between PCR results and clinical findings are scarce. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features of PCR-positive M. pneumoniae infections in a hospital setting. We reviewed 103 PCR-positive patients cared for in a university hospital during a 3-year period. Data on age, sex, health condition, acute symptoms, other pathogens found, laboratory and X-ray results and treatments were collected. Over 85% of the patients had a triad of typical symptoms: fever, cough and shortness of breath. Symptoms in the upper respiratory tract were rare. In 91% of the cases, M. pneumoniae was the only pathogen found. The highest incidence was found in the age group of 30-40 years, and 68% of the patients did not have any underlying diseases. Most patients were initially empirically treated with beta-lactam antibiotics and needed 2-4 changes in their treatment. Only 6% were discharged without an antibiotic effective against M. pneumoniae. This study shows that M. pneumoniae often led to hospitalisation and that patients needed appropriate antimicrobial treatment to recover. Mixed infections were rare, and situations that could be interpreted as carriage did not occur.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.03867564
2585,"Solid cancer mortality associated with chronic external radiation exposure at the french atomic energy commission and nuclear fuel company. Studies of nuclear workers make it possible to directly quantify the risks associated with ionizing radiation exposure at low doses and low dose rates. Studies of the CEA (Commissariat l'Energie Atomique) and AREVA Nuclear Cycle (AREVA NC) cohort, currently the most informative such group in France, describe the long-term risk to nuclear workers associated with external exposure. Our aim is to assess the risk of mortality from solid cancers among CEA and AREVA NC nuclear workers and its association with external radiation exposure. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and internal Poisson regressions were conducted, controlling for the main confounding factors sex, attained age, calendar period, company and socioeconomic status (SES). During the period 19682004, there were 2,035 solid cancers among the 36,769 CEA-AREVA NC workers. Cumulative external radiation exposure was assessed for the period 19502004, and the mean cumulative dose was 12.1 mSv. Mortality rates for all causes and all solid cancers were both significantly lower in this cohort than in the general population. A significant excess of deaths from pleural cancer, not associated with cumulative external dose, was observed, probably due to past asbestos exposure. We observed a significant excess of melanoma, also unassociated with dose. Although cumulative external dose was not associated with mortality from all solid cancers, the central estimated excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv of 0.46 for solid cancer mortality was higher than the 0.26 calculated for male Hiroshima and Nagasaki A-bomb survivors 50 years or older and exposed at the age of 30 years or older. The modification of our results after stratification for SES demonstrates the importance of this characteristic in occupational studies, because it makes it possible to take class-based lifestyle differences into account, at least partly. These results show the great potential of a further joint international study of nuclear workers, which should improve knowledge about the risks associated with chronic low doses and provide useful risk estimates for radiation protection. © 2011 by Radiation Research Society.",Included,0.97077346
2586,"Carcinoma of the larynx treated with hypofractionated radiation and hyperbaric oxygen: Long-term tumor control and complications. Purpose: To evaluate the long-term outcome with respect to local control, survival, and complications in a cohort of patients with locally advanced laryngeal carcinoma treated with hypofractionated radiation and hyperbaric oxygen at 4 atmospheres of pressure (HBO-4). Methods and Materials: Between January 1970 and August 1982, 45 patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the larynx were treated with primary radiation using a unique hypofractionated schedule of 2 fractions of 11 Gy separated by 21 days, with concomitant HBO-4 during each radiotherapy session. To avoid seizures, discomfort and other complications of HBO-4, each session was performed under general anesthesia. All patients had pathologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic (23) or supraglottic larynx (22) and were staged as follows: T2-5, T3-24, T-4-16; N0-26, N1-4, N2-13, N3-1. Patients were treated with opposed lateral wedged fields of 4-6MV photons, with a median field size of 5.5 x 9.75 to a total median dose of 22.5 Gy. Result(s): As of February 1998, follow-up was complete on all but one patient, who relocated to another country after 8 years. Complete clinical responses were observed in 39 (87%) of the cases. The 10-year local control rate for all 45 patients was 58%, and local control for the complete responders was 69%. Three patients underwent laryngectomy for complications and were found to have no pathological evidence of disease in the laryngectomy specimen. The 10-year survival of the overall population was 27%. The 10-year voice preservation rate for the the 39 complete responders was 55%. Acute mucosal and skin reactions were modest and acceptable. Significant late complications occurred in 14 patients consisting of severe fibrosis, necrosis, pharyngeal fistula, with 3 patients requiring laryngectomy for complications. The actuarial rate of severe complications at 5 years was 42%. Conclusion(s): The response rate and long-term tumor control rate obtained with this treatment program were comparable to more protracted radiation schedules with or without systemic chemotherapy. The complication rate was high resulting in an adverse therapeutic ratio. The radiobiologic interpretation of this clinical data, and implications for hypoxia directed therapy, are discussed.",Excluded,0.03843148

Background: Aged patients are underrepresented in clinical trials on catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). In addition, results of outcomes after repeat ablation in the elderly are lacking. We report the results of first repeat AF ablation procedures of aged patients from a real-world multicenter prospective registry. Method(s): Patients undergoing second AF ablation included in the prospective, multicenter German Ablation Registry were divided in two groups (age > 70 years (group 1) and age <= 70 years (group 2)) and analyzed for procedural characteristics and clinical follow-up. Result(s): 738 patients were analyzed (108 patients in group 1, 630 patients in group 2). Significantly more aged patients had structural heart disease (56 patients (51.9%) vs. 203 patients (32.2%), p < 0.001). The majority of the patients underwent repeat pulmonary vein isolation (101 patients (93.5%) vs. 593 patients (94.1%), p = 0.98). More aged patients underwent ablation of left atrial linear lesions (78.1% vs. 57.3% of all linear lesions, p = 0.027). There was no difference in the occurrence of peri-procedural complications (7 patients (6.5%) vs. 24 patients (3.8%), p = 0.30).

Objectives: To prospectively evaluate radiation dose and image quality of a third generation dual-source CT (DSCT) without z-axis filter behind the patient for temporal bone CT., Methods: Forty-five patients were either examined on a first, second, or third generation DSCT in an ultra-high-resolution (UHR) temporal bone-imaging mode. On the third generation DSCT system, the tighter focal spot of 0.2 mm2 removesthe necessity for an additional z-axis-filter, leading to an improved z-axis radiation dose efficiency. Images of 0.4 mm were reconstructed using standard filtered-back-projection or iterative reconstruction (IR) technique for previous generations of DSCT and a novel IR algorithm for the third generation DSCT. Radiation dose and image quality were compared between the three DSCT systems., Results: The statistically significantly highest subjective and objective image quality was evaluated for the third generation DSCT when compared to the first or second generation DSCT systems (all p < 0.05). Total effective dose was 63 %/39 % lower for the third generation examination as compared to the first and second generation DSCT., Conclusions: Temporal bone imaging without z-axis-UHR-filter and a novel third generation IR algorithm allows for significantly higher image quality while lowering effective dose when compared to the first two generations of DSCTs.Copyright © 2014, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded,0.03825985

Previous randomized trials have shown a benefit with concurrent use of the hypoxic cell cytotoxin mitomycin C (MC) and radiation (RT) in the management of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN). We conducted a randomized trial comparing MC with porfiromycin (POR) in combination with RT in the management of SCCHN. Between 1992 and 1999, 128 patients with SCCHN were enrolled in this prospective randomized trial. Patients were stratified by management intent, and balanced with respect to stage and site of disease. They were randomized to receive MC (15 mg/M2) or POR (40 mg/M2) on Days 5 and 47 (or last day) of RT. Of 121 evaluable patients, 61 were randomized to MC and 60 to POR. Patients were treated with standard daily RT to a total median dose of 64 Gy over 47 days. Patients were well balanced with respect to management intent, stage, site, age, sex, hemoglobin levels, tumor grade, radiation dose, and days on treatment. There were no significant differences between the two arms with respect to acute hematologic or nonhematologic toxicities. As of January 2003 with a median follow-up of 6.3 years, there have been 19 local relapses (4 MC vs. 15 POR), 21 regional relapses (7 MC vs. 14 POR), 24 distant metastases (11 MC vs. 13 POR), and 66 deaths (33 MC vs. 33 POR). MC was superior to POR with respect to 5-year local relapse-free survival (91.6% vs. 72.7%, p = 0.01), local-regional relapse-free survival (82% vs. 65.3%, p = 0.05), and disease-free survival (72.8% vs. 52.9%, p = 0.026). There were no significant differences between the two arms with respect to overall survival (49.2% vs. 54.4%) or distant metastasis-free rate (79.9% vs. 75.9%). Despite promising preclinical data, and an acceptable toxicity profile, POR was inferior to MC as an adjunct to RT in the management of SCCHN.

2591,"Ionizing radiation causes a dose-dependent release of transforming growth factor alpha in vitro from irradiated xenografts and during palliative treatment of hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma. PURPOSE: Characterize the radiation response for transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha shedding in vitro and in vivo. We also report the shedding of TGF alpha by patients undergoing irradiation for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TGF alpha levels were determined by ELISA. DU145 xenografts were established on the flanks of athymic nu/nu mice. Expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the DNA repair proteins XRCC1 and ERCC1 were determined by Western analyses., RESULTS: Exposure to ionizing radiation results in a dose-dependent release of TGF alpha. Once released, TGF alpha stimulates EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling in unirradiated cells. Blockade of the EGFR with the tyrphostin AG1478 eliminates the up-regulation XRCC1 and ERCC1 by TGF alpha or irradiation. After irradiation, cells are refractory to additional transactivation of EGFR by additional irradiation for 8 to 12 hours. Irradiation during this refractory period does not increase the expression of XRCC1 or ERCC1. Ligand activation of EGFR is maintained during the refractory period. Irradiation of DU145 xenografts also results in the activation of ERK1/2, release of TGF alpha, and a similar refractory period. Ionizing irradiation also results in the release of TGF alpha for patients undergoing radiation therapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation results in a dose-dependent increase in TGF alpha capable of enhancing the growth of DU145 xenografts. TGF alpha is also shed following radiation therapy of patients treated for hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

2592,"Therapy-related myelodysplasia and secondary acute myelogenous leukemia after high-dose therapy with autologous hematopoietic progenitor-cell support for lymphoid malignancies. Purpose: To evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for therapy- related myelodysplasia (tMDS) and secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (sAML), after high-dose therapy (HDT) with autologous bone marrow or peripheral-blood progenitor-cell support, in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Patients and Methods: Between January 1985 and November 1996, 230 patients underwent HDT comprising cyclophosphamide therapy and total-body irradiation, with autologous hematopoietic progenitor-cell support, as consolidation of remission. With a median follow-up of 6 years, 27 (12%) developed tMDS or sAML. Result(s): Median time to development of tMDS or sAML was 4.4 years (range, 11 months to 8.8 years) after HDT. Karyotyping (performed in 24 cases) at diagnosis of tMDS or sAML revealed complex karyotypes in 18 patients. Seventeen patients had monosomy 5/5q-, 15 had - 7/7q-, seven had -18/18q-, seven had -13/13q-, and four had -20/20q-. Twenty- one patients died from complications of tMDS or sAML or treatment for tMDS or sAML, at a median of 10 months (range, 0 to 26 months). Sixteen died without evidence of recurrent lymphoma. Six patients were alive at a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 2 to 22 months) after diagnosis of tMDS or sAML. On multivariate analysis, prior fludarabine therapy (P = .009) and older age (P = .02) were associated with the development of tMDS or sAML. Increased interval from diagnosis to HDT and bone marrow involvement at diagnosis were of borderline significance (P = .05 and .07, respectively). Conclusion(s): tMDS and sAML are serious complications of HDT for NHL and are associated with very poor prognosis. Alternative strategies for reducing their incidence and for treatment are needed.

2594,"The Aftermath of Surviving Acute Radiation Hematopoietic Syndrome and its Mitigation. Intensive research is underway to find new agents that can successfully mitigate the acute effects of radiation exposure. This is primarily in response to potential counterthreats of radiological terrorism and nuclear accidents but there is some hope that they might also be of value for cancer patients treated with radiation therapy. Research into mitigation countermeasures typically employs classic animal models of acute radiation syndromes (ARS) that develop after whole-body irradiation (WBI). While agents are available that successfully mitigate ARS when given after radiation exposure, their success raises questions as to whether they simply delay lethality or unmask potentially lethal radiation pathologies that may appear later in time. Life shortening is a well-known consequence of WBI in humans and experimental animals, but it is not often examined in a mitigation setting and its causes, other than cancer, are not well-defined. This is in large part because delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) do not follow the strict time-dose phenomena associated with ARS and present as a diverse range of symptoms and pathologies with low mortality rates that can be evaluated only with the use of large cohorts of subjects, as in this study. Here, we describe chronically increased mortality rates up to 660 days in large numbers of mice given LD70/30 doses of WBI. Systemic myeloid cell activation after WBI persists in some mice and is associated with late immunophenotypic changes and hematopoietic imbalance. Histopathological changes are largely of a chronic inflammatory nature and variable incidence, as are the clinical symptoms, including late diarrhea that correlates temporally with changes in the content of the microbiome. We also describe the acute and long-term consequences of mitigating hematopoietic ARS (H-ARS) lethality after LD70/30 doses of WBI in multiple cohorts of mice treated uniformly with radiation mitigators that have a common 4-nitro-phenylsulfonamide (NPS) pharmacophore. Effective NPS mitigators dramatically decrease ARS mortality. There is slightly increased subacute mortality, but the rate of late mortalities is slowed, allowing some mice to live a normal life span, which is not the case for WBI controls. The study has broad relevance to radiation late effects and their potential mitigation and epitomizes the complex interaction between radiation-damaged tissues and immune homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 by Radiation Research Society.

In case of failure to detect an relevant pathology, the final clinical diagnosis was established after a mean follow-up period of 18 +/- 6 months (10 months to 2 years). Costs and radiation exposure of IVP and MDCT were compared., RESULTS: MDCT scan performed better than IVP in terms of image quality for all regarded variables. Image quality of MDCT was rated in all parameters as very good or good; the image quality of IVP differed in a wide range. MDCT and IVP reached a sensitivity of 100 % and 50 % for stone detection (n = 14, p = 0.008), respectively. Two bladder stones were not detected by IVU but correctly seen with MDCT. MDCT and IVP were unsatisfactory for detecting transitional cell carcinomas (n = 4, 2 of 4 detected with MDCT, 0 of 4 detected with IVU). One false positive transitional cell carcinoma was detected with IVP, none with MDCT. Additional relevant pathological changes (one teratoma, one abdominal aortic aneurysma and one abscess) were detected using MDCT but missed with IVP. In 38 of 59 patients (64 %) imaging and clinical follow-up over up to 24 months did not reveal any pathology to explain the microhematuria. The costs of the IVP (283 Euro) were lower compared with non-enhanced MDCT (380 Euro) or combined non-enhanced and contrast-enhanced MDCT (560 Euro). The radiation exposure was 23 - 27 mSv for MDCT and 2.3 mSv for IVP., CONCLUSION: MDCT performed better regarding image quality, subjective diagnostic certainty and diagnostic results with respect to stone detection. Since urolithiasis is a frequent cause of painless microhematuria MDCT is recommended as the initial imaging modality rather than IVU.",Excluded,0.03827703
2598,"A randomized comparison of the transradial and transfemoral approaches for coronary artery bypass graft angiography and intervention: the RADIAL-CABG Trial (RADIAL Versus Femoral Access for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Angiography and Intervention). OBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare and contrast use and radiation exposure using radial versus femoral access during cardiac catheterization of patients who had previously undergone coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery., BACKGROUND: Limited information is available on the relative merits of radial compared with femoral access for cardiac catheterization in patients who had previously undergone CABG surgery., METHODS: Consecutive patients (N = 128) having previously undergone CABG surgery and referred for cardiac catheterization were randomized to radial or femoral access. The primary study endpoint was contrast volume. Secondary endpoints included fluoroscopy time, procedure time, patient and operator radiation exposure, vascular complications, and major adverse cardiac events. Analyses were by intention-to-treat., RESULTS: Compared with femoral access, diagnostic coronary angiography via radial access was associated with a higher mean contrast volume (142 +/- 39 ml vs. 171 +/- 72 ml, p < 0.01), longer procedure time (21.9 +/- 6.8 min vs. 34.2 +/- 14.7 min, p < 0.01), greater patient air kerma (kinetic energy released per unit mass) radiation exposure (1.08 +/- 0.54 Gy vs. 1.29 +/- 0.67 Gy, p = 0.06), and higher operator radiation dose (first operator: 1.3 +/- 1.0 mrem vs. 2.6 +/- 1.7 mrem, p < 0.01; second operator 0.8 +/- 1.1 mrem vs. 1.8 +/- 2.1 mrem, p = 0.01). Fewer patients underwent ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the radial group (37.5% vs. 46.9%, p = 0.28) and radial PCI procedures were less complex. The incidences of the primary and secondary endpoints was similar with femoral and radial access among PCI patients. Access crossover was higher in the radial group (17.2% vs. 0.0%, p < 0.01) and vascular access site complications were similar in both groups (3.1%)., CONCLUSIONS: In patients who had previously undergone CABG surgery, transradial diagnostic coronary angiography was associated with greater contrast use, longer procedure time, and greater access crossover and operator radiation exposure compared with transfemoral angiography.

2599,"Investigative strategies for fish bone foreign bodies during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: An analysis of ENT UK guidelines. Abstract Background By nature of their specialty, otolaryngologists are disproportionately exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 through aerosol-generating procedures and close proximity to the oropharynx during examination. Methods Our single-centre, retrospective study analysed the pertinence of guidelines produced by ENT UK to improve the investigation and management of suspected upper aerodigestive fish bone foreign bodies during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Results Our results demonstrated 43.3 per cent (n = 13) low-risk cases and 56.7 per cent (n = 17) moderate-risk cases. Nine fish bones (two low risk, seven moderate risk) were found; none of these were confirmed with X-ray and three (moderate risk) required nasoendoscopy for diagnosis. One patient required rigid pharyngoscopy. Conclusion This study confirms that soft tissue neck X-ray and flexible nasoendoscopy are unnecessary in low-risk cases; however, early nasoendoscopy in higher suspicion cases is appropriate. Recommendations are made about the long-term sustainability of these guidelines, and additional measures are encouraged that relate to repeat attendances and varying prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 in the hospital catchment area.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

2600,"Comparative stochastic effects of inhaled alpha- and beta-particle- emitting radionuclides in beagle dogs. The stochastic effects of inhaled, insoluble particles of alpha- or beta- particle-emitting radionuclides were compared in dogs. Male and female beagle dogs were exposed briefly by nasal inhalation to relatively insoluble aerosols of 239PuO2 or 144Ce in fused aluminosilicate particles (FAP) and observed for cancer for their lifetimes. The initial lung burden and retention of each radionuclide was determined by whole-body counting of the emissions from 144Ce-144Pr- or 169Yb-labeled 239PuO2. Lung doses were calculated for each dog from these data. The lung doses ranged from 0.21 to 1200 Gy for 144Ce FAP and 1.6 to 58 Gy for 239PuO2. Dogs with doses to the lung of about 60 Gy or greater from 144Ce or about 2 Gy or greater from 239PuO2 had an increased incidence of lung carcinomas. In dogs exposed to 144Ce FAP, three organs were targets for neoplasia: lung, tracheobronchial lymph nodes, and heart. The insoluble FAP carried to the lymph nodes draining the lung delivered high radiation doses to the nodes and adjacent heart, resulting in hemangiosarcomas of these organs. In the lung, high radiation doses induced hemangiosarcomas and carcinosarcomas. At lower doses, carcinomas of various histological patterns were induced in the lung. In dogs exposed to 239PuO2, the lung was the sole target organ for neoplasia. Nearly all of these neoplasms were carcinomas of various histological patterns. These results indicated that relatively low doses of alpha-particle radiation can induce pulmonary cancers, but relatively large doses of beta-particle radiation are required. In addition, inhaled beta-particle emitters can also induce cancers in lung-associated lymph nodes and heart at these larger absorbed radiation doses.",Included,0.9707482
2601,"Delayed non-myeloablative irradiation after lung transplantation to induce allograft acceptance in a large animal model. Purpose: Previously, we induced long term tolerance in animals that underwent perioperative irradiation and a donor-specific alloantigen infusion in our miniature swine lung transplantation model. Here, we delayed induction to improve its clinical applicability. Method(s): Left sided single lung transplantation from MHC mismatched male donors was performed in 11 female outbred minipigs. Group 1 (n= 5) received non-myeloablative irradiation (7 Gy thymus and 1,5 Gy whole body, IRR) 12 hours before transplantation and perioperative donor-specific splenocyte infusion (SpTx). Group 2 (n= 3) also received a perioperative SpTx, but underwent delayed irradiation 3 days after transplantation. Group 3 (n= 3) was also exposed to delayed IRR but did not receive a donor-specific SpTx. Immunosuppression was maintained for 28 days with tacrolimus and methylprednisolone. Peripheral blood chimerism was monitored by flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Result(s): In group 1, three animals never rejected their grafts until elective sacrifice at postoperative days (POD) 800+, the other two showed rejection on POD 239 and 360. In group 2, median allograft survival was 92 days. Out of the third group, one animal showed rejection on POD 226, the other two are currently alive at POD 216 and 393. In all groups, chimerism was detectable 1 hour after reperfusion of the lung, and peaked 1 hour after SpTx in groups 1 and 2. Group 1 showed early leukocyte chimerism levels of up to 30%. Analysis of putative regulatory CD4+CD25 high T cells revealed a rising tendency in group 1, whereas groups 2 and 3 had decreasing levels of this T cell subpopulation after withdrawal of immunosuppression. Conclusion(s): Preoperative irradiation and perioperative SpTx had the potential to upregulate the frequency of putative regulatory CD4+CD25 high T cells. SpTx without preceding IRR seemed to rather upregulate the effector arm, than inducing Treg proliferation. Delayed IRR only may lead to prolonged allograft survival in all three animals. This unresponsiveness might be due to induced anergy.",Excluded,0.8340769
2602,"A pilot comparison of 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT, ultrasonography and 123I/99mTc-sestaMIBI dual-phase dual-isotope scintigraphy in the preoperative localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands in primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism: Influence of thyroid anomalies. We compared 18F-fluorocholine hybrid positron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography (FCH-PET/CT) with ultrasonography (US) and scintigraphy in patients with hyperparathyroidism and discordant, or equivocal results of US and 123I/99mTc-sesta-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (sestaMIBI) dual-phase parathyroid scintigraphy. FCH-PET/CT was performed in 17 patients with primary (n=11) lithium induced (n=1) or secondary hyperparathyroidism (1 dialyzed, 4 renal-transplanted). The reference standard was based on results of surgical exploration and histopathological examination. The results of imaging modalities were evaluated, on site and by masked reading, on per-patient and perlesion bases. In a first approach, equivocal images/foci were considered as negative. On a per-patient level, the sensitivity was for US 38%, for scintigraphy 69% by open and 94% by masked reading, and for FCHPET/CT 88% by open and 94% by masked reading. On a per-lesion level, sensitivity was for US 42%, for scintigraphy 58% by open and 83% by masked reading, and for FCH-PET/CT 88% by open and 96% by masked reading. One ectopic adenoma was missed by the 3 imaging modalities. Considering equivocal images/foci as positive increased the accuracy of the open reading of scintigraphy or of FCH-PET/CT, but not of US. FCH-PET/CT was significantly superior to US in all approaches, whereas it was more sensitive than scintigraphy only for open reading considering equivocal images/foci as negative (P=0.04). FCH uptake was more intense in adenomas than in hyperplastic parathyroid glands. Thyroid lesions were suspected in 9 patients. They may induce falsepositive results as in one case of oncocytic thyroid adenoma, or falsenegative results as in one case of intrathyroidal parathyroid adenoma. Thyroid cancer (4 cases) can be visualized with FCH as with 99mTcsestaMIBI, but the intensity of uptake was moderate, similar to that of parathyroid hyperplasia. This pilot study confirmed that FCH-PET/CT is an adequate imaging tool in patients with primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, since both adenomas and hyperplastic parathyroid glands can be detected. The sensitivity of FCH-PET/CT was better than that of US and was not inferior to that of dual-phase dual-isotope 123I/99mTcscintigraphy. Further studies should evaluate whether FCH could replace 99mTc-sestaMIBI as the functional agent for parathyroid imaging, but US would still be useful to identify thyroid lesions.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2603,"[123 I]Iodometomidate for molecular imaging of adrenocortical cytochrome P450 family 11B enzymes. BACKGROUND: Due to advances in conventional imaging, adrenal tumors are detected with increasing frequency. However, conventional imaging provides only limited information on the origin of these lesions, which represent a wide range of different pathological entities. New specific imaging methods would therefore be of great clinical value. We, therefore, studied the potential of iodometomidate (IMTO) as tracer for molecular imaging of cytochrome P450 family 11B (Cyp11B) enzymes., METHODS: Inhibition of Cyp11B1 and Cyp11B2 by IMTO, etomidate, metomidate, and fluoroetomidate was investigated in NCI-h295 cells and in Y1 cells stably expressing hsCyp11B1 or hsCyp11B2. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution after iv injection of [(123/125)I]IMTO were analyzed in mice in biodistribution experiments and by small-animal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Furthermore, four patients with known adrenal tumors (two metastatic adrenal adenocarcinomas, one bilateral adrenocortical adenoma, and one melanoma metastasis) were investigated with [(123)I]iodometomidate-SPECT., RESULTS: In cell culture experiments, all compounds potently inhibited both Cyp11B1 and Cyp11B2. Adrenals showed high and specific uptake of [(123/125)I]IMTO and were excellently visualized in mice. In patients, adrenocortical tissue showed high and specific tracer uptake in both primary tumor and metastases with short investigation time and low radiation exposure, whereas the non-adrenocortical tumor did not exhibit any tracer uptake., CONCLUSION: We have successfully completed the development of an in vivo detection system of adrenal Cyp11B enzymes by [(123)I]IMTO scintigraphy in both experimental animals and humans. Our findings suggest that [(123)I]IMTO is a highly specific radiotracer for imaging of adrenocortical tissue. Due to the general availability of SPECT technology, we anticipate that [(123)I]IMTO scintigraphy may become a widely used tool to characterize adrenal lesions.",Excluded,0.03871541
2604,"Comparative efficacy of repetitive nerve stimulation, exercise, and cold in differentiating myotonic disorders. The decremental response of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) to provocative tests is not characterized in genetically verified myotonic disorders. We therefore studied the relationship between decremental responses and mutation type in 10 patients with recessive myotonia congenita (rMC), two with paramyotonia congenita (PMC), nine with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), four with DM2, and 14 healthy people. CMAPs were measured at rest, just after a short exercise test (SET), and during short, 5- and 10-HZ, repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) trains at 32 degrees C and at 20 degrees C. The degree of decrement was not related to the severity of clinical myotonia. Controls and PMC patients had similar responses when warm, but with cooling PMC patients had a persistent decrement of CMAPs. In the rMC patients the decremental responses were related to the type of mutation of the CLCN1 gene, as a decrement was encountered in the T268M, R894X, IVS17+1 G>T, K248X, and 2149 del G, but not with the IVS1+3 A>T, F167L, or dominant A313T mutations. In DM1 patients there was no relationship between decrement and CTG repeats. The degree of partial inexcitability in myotonic muscle membrane therefore depends on the mutation type rather than degree of clinical myotonia. RNS at 10 HZ is more sensitive than SET for demonstrating abnormalities in rMC patients when warm; differences are less marked when cold, which is useful to diagnose PMC. Provocative tests are therefore useful in myotonias to demonstrate muscle inexcitability, which depends on the chloride or sodium channelopathy.",Excluded,0.039835162

Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Gamma knife radiosurgery for the treatment of cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma. Method(s): From June 2010 to July 2016, 35 consecutive patients with cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma treated with Gamma knife radiosurgery at the Department of Neurosurgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University were enrolled retrospective, including 22 females and 13 males. All patients were diagnosed by MRI before procedure. They were confirmed by postoperative histopathology or further verification by MRI. The irradiation dose of Gamma knife around tumors were 11-16 Gy (mean 14.3 +/-1.1 Gy), covered by 45%-50% isodose line and ensured that the exposure dose of the optic cross was less than 8 Gy. In the first year after operation, they were followed up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and after that, the clinical efficacy, surgical complications and tumor volume were evaluated once a year. Result(s): Thirty-five patients were followed up for 12-77 months (mean 36 +/-4months). No surgery-related optic nerve injury and new cranial nerve injury occurred in all cases. Symptomatic patients were 28 (80%) and symptomatic improvement rate was 96. 4% (n = 27), among them, the symptoms were improved in 15 cases (53. 6%), and the symptoms disappeared in 12 cases (42. 9%), did not have any change in 1 (3. 6%) case, and no symptom deterioration occurred. The symptom improvement time was 2-7 months after surgery (mean 3.7 +/-0.3 months). Imaging follow-up revealed that in 35patients with cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma treated by gamma knife radiosurgery, the tumor volume was significantly reduced after treatment compared with that before treatment, and the difference was statistically significant (8.8 +/-0.9 cm3 vs. 32. 6 +/-3. 6 cm3, t = 8. 492, P < 0. 01). The rates of tumor volume change were <=25%, 26%-50%, 51%-75%, and >=75%. There were 3 patients (8.6%), 2 (5.7%), 8 (22.9%), and 22 (62. 9%).respectively. Conclusion(s): Gamma knife radiosurgery is safe and effective in the treatment of cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma. It can be used as the preferred treatment modality for this disease, but long-term follow-up is needed to observe its long-term efficacy.Copyright © 2018 Society of China University Journals in Natural Sciences.

2606,"Compartments and cell flows within the mouse haemopoietic system. II. Estimated rates of interchange. Part-body irradiated CBA mice were injected with CBA-T6 bone marrow. In this way a predominantly donor population was established in the femora while the marrow of the humeri remained largely (average 94%) of host origin. In animals examined cytologically up to 2 years later, no tendency was observed for the proportion of donor cells in the humeri to increase. Splenectomy had no effect on this. When femoral bone marrow from the experimental mice was injected into lethally (whole-body) irradiated recipients, cells originating from the primary host repopulated the lymph nodes to a disproportionate extent. Equilibration between the cell populations of femora and humeri occurred after re-exposure to 600 rad whole-body irradiation, but not after 100 rad or 350 rad; thus, regeneration of damaged bone marrow involved a significant contribution from extrinsic stem cells only after the highest dose of radiation. The data are compatible with an inflow of at most ten effective stem cells per humerus per day from the blood, and suggest a much lower figure. This means that few if any of the stem cells of peripheral blood enter the bone marrow and found haemopoietic clones. Evidence is adduced for the existence of a proliferating lymphoid sub-population in the bone marrow, contributing some 5-10% of the observed mitoses. The mitotic cells in the lymph nodes are replaced from marrow-derived progenitors at an estimated rate of 4-5%/day. The relevant data for the thymus are more variable, but suggest an average figure of 8-11%/day. Earlier data from mouse parabionts suggest a lower rate of inflow to the thymus.",Excluded,0.81847376

Donor lymphocytes were stimulated with irradiated expanded recipient T lymphocytes in an ex vivo mixed lymphocyte reaction. Alloactivated T cells preferentially retaining the photosensitizer 4,5-dibromorhodamine 123 (TH9402) were eliminated by exposure to visible light.

2608,"Cognitive impairment following radiation to hippocampus and other brain structures in adults with primary brain tumours. Background: Radiation therapy (RT) to the brain may result in cognitive impairment. The primary objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between RT dose to the hippocampus and learning and memory functions. Secondary objective was to examine relationships between doses to other brain structures and specific cognitive functions. Method(s): A cross-sectional analysis was undertaken in 78 primary brain tumour patients after RT. Cognitive function was assessed by neuropsychological tests. Test scores were standardized using normative data adjusted for age and level of education. Test-specific cognitive impairment was determined as a z-score <=-1.5. Radiation dose to brain structures and test-specific cognitive impairment outcomes were fitted to a logistic regression model. Result(s): High RT dose to the left hippocampus was associated with impaired verbal learning and memory (p = 0.04). RT dose to the left hippocampus, left temporal lobe, left frontal lobe and total frontal lobe were associated with verbal fluency impairment (p < 0.05) and doses to the thalamus and the left frontal lobe with impaired executive functioning (p <= 0.03). Finally, RT dose to the brain and thalamus were associated with impaired processing speed (p <= 0.05). Conclusion(s): The present study indicates that the hippocampus may be vulnerable to radiation and that high radiation doses to the left hippocampus may lead to significant verbal learning and memory impairment. High RT doses to the left hippocampus and other left side structures may result in impairments in verbal fluency, executive function, and processing speed.

Purpose: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) can have altered sugar transport into cells, potentially affecting the results of 18-FDG PET scans. The specific aim of this study was to determine the effect of DM on pre- and post treatment standard uptake value (SUV) scores in patients undergoing chemo-radiotherapy for esophageal cancer. Method(s): Patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinoma undergoing preoperative or definitive chemoradiotherapy underwent pre-and post treatment 18-FDG PET scans. Maximum SUV score was measured from the tumor before chemoradiotherapy and 3 to 4 weeks after chemoradiotherapy (preoperatively). Patients were identified as having DM by medical record review. Random serum glucose measurements were obtained prior to 18-FDG PET scans. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test for differences in SUV scores between patients with and without DM, and a generalized linear model with backward selection was applied to search for significant predictors of initial and post treatment SUV scores. Result(s): Sixty-three patients underwent 18-FDG PET scans during the course of treatment for esophageal malignancies between 6/02 and 8/05. Fifty-four patients received chemotherapy. The median radiation dose was 46.8 Gy. Eighteen patients had DM, six were insulin-dependent DM (IDDM). There was no difference in initial SUV scores between DM and non-DM patients (P >.05). There was also no difference in initial SUV scores between IDDM and non-IDDM groups. Patients with tumors at the gastroesophageal junction had lower initial SUV scores compared to patients with tumors in the lower or midesophagus(P =.05). T stage was associated with initial SUV score (T2 lower than T3, P =.014). Older age (P =.03), diabetes (P =.007), higher T stage (P =.002), and presence of nodes (P =.05) were each positively associated with post treatment SUV scores. Blood glucose levels prior to 18-FDG PET scan, endoscopic tumor length, and tumor location were not predictive of post treatment SUV scores. Patients with DM had significantly lower post treatment SUV scores compared to patients without DM (P =.04). Pathologic complete response or percent SUV decrease did not differ between patients with or without DM. Conclusion(s): Regardless of glucose levels, DM and IDDM do not influence pretreatment SUV scores in patients with localized esophageal cancer. However, DM may influence post treatment SUV scores and thus complicate interpretation of treatment response. Further confirmatory study in a larger cohort of DM patients to evaluate the relationship of post treatment SUV score to pathologic response is warranted. © 2009 by International Society of Gastrointestinal Oncology.",Excluded,0.03888296
2610,"Modifications of the cutaneous microrelief in the superficial radiation-induced fibrosis: Qualitative study. Cutaneous radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) is characterized by a skin retraction or atrophy, toughness to the palpation and often entails functional limitation. Its clinical evaluation remains poorly quantified. The aim of this study was to propose an analytical method to quantify RIF skin surface with the replica technique. In this preliminary study, we report the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the cutaneous microrelief in 44 healthy controls and in four patients presenting a superficial RIF, 3 to 20 years after radiotherapy for cancer. The microrelief of these RIF presented an abnormal anisotropy with a parallel reorganization of cutaneous valleys in three cases out of four, suggesting a premature radiation-induced ageing of the skin. Each subject being his own control, the relative vertical amplitude of the skin microrelief was +/- 15% in control skin. Vertical amplitude was respectively increased by 84% in one inflammatory fibrosis (3 years after RT), decreased by 18% in one evolutive fibrosis (6 years after RT), decreased by 26% in one voluminous stabilized fibrosis (8 years after BT) and decreased by 53% in one atrophic fibrosis (20 years after BT). The present study suggests that the variations of the microrelief parameters could reflect the RIF evolution.

Background: Obesity is a well established risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF) development. Our purpose was to determine the impact of body mass index (BMI) on the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation of AF. Method(s): Two hundred and twenty-six consecutive patients with symptomatic, drug-refractory paroxysmal (59.3%) and persistent (40.7%) AF underwent wide circumferential electrical pulmonary vein isolation. Patients were classified according to BMI as normal (< 25 kg/m2); overweight (25 to 29.9 kg/m2); and obese (>= 30 kg/m2). Result(s): Patients with high BMI were younger and displayed a higher rate of hypertension, increased left atrial diameter, increased left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, and increased levels of several conventional markers of inflammation and oxidative stress including white blood cell count, fibrinogen, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase (p < 0.05). After a mean follow-up period of 432.32 +/- 306.09 days from the index procedure, AF recurrence rate was 34.9% for normal weight, 46.2% for overweight, and 46.2% for obese patients (p: 0.258). Subjects classified above the 50th percentile for BMI displayed a trend toward a higher AF recurrence rate (p: 0.08). In univariate Cox regression survival analysis, BMI was not predictive of AF recurrence. Radiation exposure was significantly higher in overweight and obese patients in relation to normal weight patients (p: 0.003). No significant differences regarding major complications were observed among BMI groups.

BACKGROUND: Airway complications after lung transplantation remain a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Interventional bronchoscopic management continues to be the main modality in the management of these problems., METHODS: Four patients with airway stenoses after lung transplantation received high dose rate brachytherapy for management of recurrent stenosis. All 4 patients had been treated with various bronchoscopic interventions, including dilation and stenting, electrocautery ablation, and neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser therapy. High dose rate endobronchial brachytherapy was subsequently used in all 4 patients for management of recurrent airway obstruction.

2614,"Neoadjuvant capecitabine, bevacizumab and radiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer: results of a single-institute Phase I study. The aim of this Phase I clinical trial was to assess the feasibility and safety of capecitabine-based preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) combined with bevacizumab and to determine the optimal capecitabine dose for Japanese patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Patients with cT3/T4 rectal cancer were eligible. Bevacizumab was administered at 5 mg/kg intravenously on Days 1, 15 and 29. Capecitabine was administered on weekdays concurrently with pelvic radiotherapy at a daily dose of 1.8 Gy, totally to 50.4 Gy. Capecitabine was initiated at 825 mg/m(2) twice daily at Dose Level 1, with a planned escalation to 900 mg/m(2) twice daily at Dose Level 2. Within 6.1-10.3 (median, 9.4) weeks after the completion of the CRT, surgery was performed. Three patients were enrolled at each dose level. Regarding the CRT-related acute toxicities, all of the adverse events were limited to Grade 1. There was no Grade 2 or greater toxicity. No patient needed attenuation or interruption of bevacizumab, capecitabine or radiation. All of the patients received the scheduled dose of CRT. All of the patients underwent R0 resection. Two (33.3%) of the six patients had a pathological complete response, and five (83.3%) patients experienced downstaging. In total, three patients (50%) developed postoperative complications. One patient developed an intrapelvic abscess and healed with incisional drainage. The other two patients healed following conservative treatment. This regimen was safely performed as preoperative CRT for Japanese patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. The recommended capecitabine dose is 900 mg/m(2) twice daily.Copyright © The Author 2014.

2615,"The influence of adjuvant radiotherapy dose on overall survival in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma. background Adjuvant radiotherapy (A-RT) for patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) is controversial. In the current study, the authors aim to determine whether there is an association between overall survival (OS) and A-RT dose. methods National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) data were obtained for all patients who received A-RT for resected PAC from 1998 through 2002. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed along with Kaplan-Meier estimates for A-RT levels < 40 grays (Gy), 40 Gy to < 50 Gy, 50 Gy to < 55 Gy, and >= 55 Gy. results A total of 1385 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age of the patients was 64 years (range, 29 years-87 years). All patients underwent surgical resection and A-RT with or without chemotherapy. A total of 231 patients were diagnosed with stage I disease, 273 were diagnosed with stage II disease, 734 were diagnosed with stage III disease, and 126 were diagnosed with stage IVA disease (according to the fifth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer); 21 were found to have an unknown stage of disease. The median A-RT dose was 45 Gy (range, 1.63 Gy-69 Gy). The median OS was 21 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 19 months-23 months). On multivariate analysis, an A-RT dose < 40 Gy (hazards ratio [HR], 1.30 [95% CI, 1.03-1.66]; P =.031), an A-RT dose of 40 Gy to < 50 Gy (HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.00-1.37]; P =.05), and an A-RT dose >= 55 Gy (HR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.08-1.93]; P =.013) predicted worse OS compared with the reference category of 50 Gy to < 55 Gy. conclusions A-RT doses of < 40 Gy, 40 Gy to < 50 Gy, and >= 55 Gy were found to be associated with an inferior OS.

S-2-(3-Aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioic acid (WR-2721) was investigated for its protective effect against radiation-produced damage of jejunum, testis, lung, hair follicles, and a fibrosarcoma of C3Hf/Kam mice. Most of these tissues were radioprotected, and the degree of radioprotection depended on the dose of WR-2721 and the time interval between administration of WR-2721 and radiation treatment. WR-2721 increased resistance of jejunal epithelial cells and spermatogenic cells to single doses of gamma-rays by factors of 1.64 and 1.54, respectively. Protection against hair loss was less pronounced; the dose-modifying factor here was 1.24. The radiation-induced acute damage of the lung expressed by the increased formation of tumor nodules in the lung was not decreased by treatment of animals with WR-2721 before radiation. In contrast, WR-2721 augmented the radiation-induced enhancement of metastasis formation in the lung. WR-2721 protected fibrosarcoma micrometastases in the lung against therapeutic effect of radiation by a factor of 1.238.

2617,"Evaluation of coronary artery image quality with knowledge-based iterative model reconstruction. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate knowledge-based iterative model reconstruction (IMR) to improve image quality and reduce radiation dose in coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 45 consecutive cCTA studies, including 25 studies performed with an 80% systolic dose reduction using tube current modulation (TCM). Each study was reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), hybrid iterative reconstruction (iDose(4)), and IMR in a diastolic phase. Additional systolic phase reconstructions were obtained for TCM studies. Mean pixel attenuation value and standard deviation (SD) were measured in the left ventricle and left main coronary artery. Subjective scores were obtained by two independent reviewers on a 5-point scale for definitions of contours of small coronary arteries (<3 mm), coronary calcifications, noncalcified plaque, and overall diagnostic confidence for the presence/absence of stenosis., RESULTS: There was no significant difference in pixel intensity among FBP, iDose(4), and IMR (P > .8). For diastolic phase images, noise amplitude in the left main coronary artery was reduced by a factor of 1.3 from FBP to iDose(4) (SD = 99 vs. 74; P = .005) and by a factor of 2.6 from iDose(4) to IMR (SD = 74 vs. 28; P < .001). For systolic phase TCM images, noise amplitude in the left main coronary artery was reduced by a factor of 2.3 from FBP to iDose(4) (SD = 322 vs. 142; P < .001) and by a factor of 3.0 from iDose(4) to IMR (SD = 142 vs. 48; P < .001). All four subjective image quality scores were significantly better with IMR compared to iDose(4) and FBP (P < .001). The reduction in image noise amplitude and improvement in image quality scores were greatest among obese patients., CONCLUSIONS: IMR reduces intravascular noise on cCTA by 86%-88% compared to FBP, and improves image quality at radiation exposure levels 80% below our standard technique.

2618,"Acute and late toxicity of bilateral orbital irradiation in the management of primary intraocular lymphoma. Purpose/Objective(s): Primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL) is a rare malignancy with poor outcomes. Data suggest that a combination of chemotherapy and orbital radiation therapy (RT) results in better ocular disease control and improved survival, compared to treatment with either modality alone. However, some clinicians withhold RT out of concern for toxicity, particularly vision-threatening retinopathy. We aimed to quantify the ocular toxicity of RT in PIOL patients treated uniformly with chemoimmunotherapy and RT. We hypothesized that vision-threatening complications would be rare. Materials/Methods: Eleven patients were identified who received sequential R-MPV (rituximab, methotrexate, procarbazine, and vincristine), RT, and high-dose cytarabine. Clinical information was collected from the electronic medical record. Result(s): The median age was 66 years (range 48-72). Two patients had diabetes; 1 had unilateral grade 1 diabetic retinopathy at presentation. RT targeted the bilateral orbits to a median dose of 36 Gy (range 30.6-39.6 Gy) with opposed tangential 6 MV photon beams (18%), intensity modulated RT (27%), or appositional 12-16 MeV electron beams with custom skin collimation (55%). A multidisciplinary team, including an ocular oncologist, followed patients for a median of 42 months after RT (range 8-94). Common adverse events included dermatitis (100%), conjunctivitis (82%), exophthalmia (64%), and keratopathy (45%). All phakic eyes developed cataracts (100%); cases that underwent subsequent cataract extraction maintained good visual acuity. New, visually significant retinopathy was observed in only 1 eye (<5%) and affected the only patient with pre-existing diabetic retinopathy. There was no case of radiationinduced optic neuropathy. At diagnosis, visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 15/22 eyes (68%). In the patients who did not experience an intraocular disease relapse, visual acuity at last follow-up was 20/40 or better in 9/16 eyes (56%); of note, poor vision at last follow-up was attributed to uncorrected cataracts in 4 eyes and therefore was considered correctable. Conclusion(s): This report suggests that severe, vision-threatening complications are uncommon following orbital RT and chemo-immunotherapy for PIOL. In the absence of comorbidities, orbital RT should not be withheld due to fear of vision-threatening toxicity. The risk of toxicity may be augmented by comorbidities, so an individualized approach is recommended.",Excluded,0.038357593

2620,"Utility of cone beam computed tomography verification after stereoscopic kV localization in head and neck tumors treated by stereotactic body radiation therapy. Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for tumors of the head and neck is an emerging technique gaining popularity as literature regarding its efficacy and safety continues to grow. At our institution, we utilize an x-ray 6D image-guided radiation therapy system (combined infrared-based optical positioning and stereoscopic kV pair localization) for patient positioning followed by soft tissue verification with cone beam CT (CBCT). Here, we identify the magnitude of correction based on CBCT verification after stereoscopic kV pair localization for various anatomic sites of the head and neck and identify subsites in which planning target volume (PTV) margins may be reduced or CBCT may be eliminated. Materials/Methods: The retrospective record was reviewed for patients undergoing SBRT for head and neck tumors between the dates of 6/1/15 and 12/31/15. Patients who received intra-fraction image guidance by stereoscopic kV pair imaging followed by CBCT verification were identified. The magnitude and direction of applied shifts based on CBCT imaging in the vertical, longitudinal, and lateral directions were recorded, from which the vector magnitude of each shift in three dimensions was calculated. Result(s): Thirty-three patients were treated with SBRT for head and neck pathology in the 6-month time period, of which 19 received stereoscopic kV pair localization followed by CBCT verification. For each of the 69 treatments delivered by this method, the vector magnitude was calculated for each shift. The average of these magnitudes was 1.77 mm >=1.75 mm (mean >= standard deviation). For skull base and cervical spine treatments (n = 41), the mean isocenter shift was 1.53 mm >= 1.41 mm, compared to 2.12 mm >= 2.12 mm for non-skull base, non-spine head and neck treatments (n = 28). Conclusion(s): Shifts based on soft tissue localization by CBCT after positioning by stereoscopic kV imaging were typically less than 2 mm for the head and neck treatments in this series, particularly in those treatments directed towards the skull base or cervical spine. For head and neck tumors treated with SBRT near bony anatomy, CBCT verification may not be necessary after stereoscopic kV localization provided that an additional 2 mm margin is added to the PTV in quadrature.",Excluded,0.038421772
2621,"Multiple sclerosis, brain radiotherapy, and risk of neurotoxicity: The Mayo Clinic experience. Purpose: The aim of this study was a retrospective assessment of neurotoxicity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) receiving external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to the brain. Methods and Materials: We studied 15 consecutively treated patients with MS who received brain EBRT. Neurologic toxicity was assessed with the Common Toxicity Criteria v.3.0. Result(s): Median follow-up for the 5 living patients was 6.0 years (range, 3.3-27.4 years). No exacerbation of MS occurred in any patient during EBRT. Five patients had Grade 4 neurologic toxicity and 1 had possible Grade 5 toxicity. Kaplan-Meier estimated risk of neurotoxicity greater than Grade 4 at 5 years was 57% (95% confidence interval, 27%-82%). Toxicity occurred at 37.5 to 54.0 Gy at a median of 1.0 year (range, 0.2-4.3 years) after EBRT. Univariate analysis showed an association between opposed-field irradiation of the temporal lobes, central white matter, and brainstem and increased risk of neurotoxicity (p < 0.04). Three of 6 cases of toxicity occurred in patients treated before 1986. Conclusion(s): External beam radiotherapy of the brain in patients with MS may be associated with an increased risk of neurotoxicity compared with patients without demyelinating illnesses. However, this risk is associated with treatment techniques that may not be comparable to modern, conformal radiotherapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.056105964
2622,"Temporal and spatial melanoma trends in austria: An ecological study. Annual solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is mostly determined by latitude and altitude. Over the last decades, increasing UVR ground levels have been observed. Exposure to UVR is associated with a life-time risk to develop melanoma, a malign skin cancer. Thus, we hypothesized that melanoma incidence in Austria is associated with altitude of place of living and time of diagnosis. We investigated this hypothesis in an ecological study by district and year for Austrian melanoma incidence (1990-2010) and mortality (1970-2011) data. As expected, incidence rates increased with altitude (about 2% per 10 m) and year (about 2%). Additionally, melanoma incidence rates were about 50% higher in urban than in rural districts. In contrast, mortality rates decreased with altitude (for males: 0.4% per 10 m, for women: 0.7% per 10 m, respectively). The observed discrepancy between incidence and mortality data could partly be explained by melanoma diagnosis at earlier tumor stage in districts with higher altitude. Possible reasons for this finding include higher awareness of patients, better diagnostic performance of medical professionals working at higher altitudes, or slower tumor growth due to protective effects of sun light-associated vitamin D synthesis. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded,0.038858734
2623,"Abbreviated course of radiation therapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: Clinical outcome (Mansoura university). Background:Most patients with glioblastoma are older than 60 years, but treatment guidelines are based on trials in patients aged only up to 70 years. We did this trial to assess the impact of short schedule radiotherapy in patients aged 60 years and older with glioblastoma. Patients & Methods: Fifty patients aged 60 years or older with a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) greater than or equal to 70 were treated with postoperative hypofractionated radiotherapy (34Gy administered in 3.4Gy fractions over 2 weeks). The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, and tolerance to treatment. Result(s): The median age at surgery was 71 years (range 60-81). No patient received prior or concomitant chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 12.5 months, the median progressionfree survival and overall survival were 5.8 months (95% CI, 4.1-7.9) and 10 months (95% CI, 8.9-11.1) respectively. Type of surgery (total resection vs. subtotal vs. biopsy) remained a prognostic factor (p=0.034).

2624,"Impact of Endovascular Technique on Fluoroscopy Usage: Stent-Assisted Coiling versus Flow Diversion for Paraclinoid Internal Carotid Artery Aneurysms. Flow diversion is increasingly being utilized for the treatment of internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of endovascular technique--flow diversion versus stent-assisted coiling (SAC) on fluoroscopy time in patients treated for wide-neck paraclinoid ICA aneurysms. A retrospective review identified the 20 most recent consecutive patients treated for wide-neck paraclinoid ICA aneurysms by flow diversion and SAC respectively. Fluoroscopy time, cumulative dose area-product (DAP), contrast usage, intra-procedural complications, and total procedure time were collected and compared between the two treatment techniques. Treatment groups were comparable in terms of demographics, contrast usage, and clinical and angiographic outcomes. Flow diversion was associated with a significant reduction in fluoroscopy time (52.0 minutes versus 77.4 minutes), and demonstrated a strong trend towards shorter total procedure time (172 minutes versus 202 minutes). Average patient radiation exposure as measured by DAP was lower in the flow diversion group, 13225 mGy(x)cm(2) versus 15124 mGy(x)cm(2), although this finding was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference in contrast usage between the two groups, 152 ml and 159 (flow diversion and SAC respectively). The rate of complete aneurysm occlusion was higher in the flow diversion group (80% versus 60%). Endovascular treatment of paraclinoid ICA aneurysms with flow diversion is associated with shorter fluoroscopy times compared to stent-assisted coiling. There is also a likely reduction in overall procedure time. These results should be considered when recommending a treatment course for patients with such lesions.",Excluded,0.038274694

AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the effect of omitting predilation on feasibility, procedural results and safety in balloon-expandable TAVI., METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed an analysis of all 680 patients scheduled for a balloon-expandable TAVI prosthesis between January 2011 and August 2016. Patients treated with or without predilation were compared. Procedure times decreased from 85.6+/-42.9 to 56.7+/-26.1 minutes (p<0.001), fluoroscopy times from 9.5+/-5.7 to 6.2+/-3.9 minutes (p<0.001) and contrast volume from 131.9+/-60.8 to 85.4+/-37.4 ml (p<0.001) without predilation. Intraprocedural CPR was significantly more frequent in the predilation group (5.3% vs. 1.4%, p=0.01). Stroke rate was low at 1.5% and with no detectable difference. Applying VARC-2 definitions, the combined endpoints device success (88.3% vs. 92.4%, p=0.07) and clinical efficacy (88.7% vs. 92.4%, p=0.11) were comparable with or without prior valvuloplasty, while early safety was less frequent with predilation (85.2% vs. 90.2%, p=0.04).

2626,"Reactive oxygen species and DNA damage after ultrasound exposure. The aim of this work was to detect the formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals after ultrasound (US) exposure and test the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species induced by ultrasound can contribute to DNA damage. Formation of reactive oxygen species was observed in incubated medium after sonication with 1 MHz continuous ultrasound at the intensities of 0.61-2.44 W/cm2. Free radicals and hydrogen peroxide produced by ultrasound exposure of cells can lead to DNA damage. Comet assay was used to assess the effect of ultrasound on the level of nuclear DNA damage. The nucleated erythrocytes from fish were exposed in vitro to ultrasound at the same intensities and frequency. It was noticed that ultrasound in all used intensities induced DNA damage. The effect was not eliminated by the addition of catalase, which indicates that DNA damage was not caused by hydrogen peroxide only. The results showed that the DNA damage can be repair and this mechanism was the most effective after 30 and 60 min after sonication. Furthermore, the ultrasound-induced DNA damage in the presence of sonosensitizer (Zn- and AlCl-phthalocyanine) was studied.

Introduction: The aim of our work is to quantify the radiation damage in lymphocytes after labelling with [18F]FDG. Comparison with gold standard [99mTc]HMPAO labelling is established. An approach to cellular dosimetry is proposed. Method(s): Mixed leukocytes were separated from fresh venous blood and labelled with [18F]FDG and [99mTc]HMPAO following published guidelines. Cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay was performed for both sets of experiments. Tests for quality control of labelling described in guidelines were followed. Cellular dosimetry was calculated according to MIRD. Result(s): MN scored after labelling with 37. MBq of [18F]FDG were 956 +/- 172 and 347 +/- 26 for [99mTc]HMPAO (p < 0.05). Absorbed dose in cell nucleus was of 0.23. Gy for [18F]FDG and 0.08. Gy for [99mTc]HMPAO labelling. The CBMN assay after labelling with ~ 290 MBq of [18F]FDG showed radiation induced inhibition of proliferation capacity of the lymphocytes, confirmed by proliferation study. Conclusion(s): [18F]FDG labelling of mixed leukocytes causes severe radiation damage to the cell, higher than with [99mTc]HMPAO in accordance with the absorbed dose. Labelling of mixed leukocytes for clinical purpose induces high cytotoxicity reflected in the loss of proliferation capacity in lymphocytes this statement allows us to consider a low oncogenic risk however the association between MN formation in the PBL and subsequent risk of cancer is not well established. Advances in knowledge: This is the first work about radiation damage with [18F]FDG labelled cells. We focused on [18F]FDG labelling of leukocytes due to the growing number of research and review articles about this technique. Implications for patient care: The possibility of an increased risk of lymphoid malignancies associated with the administration of radiolabelled lymphocytes is a very controversial subject.

Importance In locally advanced pancreatic cancer, the role of chemoradiotherapy is controversial and the efficacy of erlotinib is unknown. OBJECTIVES To assess whether chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer controlled after 4 months of gemcitabine-based induction chemotherapy and to assess the effect of erlotinib on survival. DESIGN, SETTING,ANDPARTICIPANTS InLAP07, an international, open-label, phase3randomized trial, 449 patientswere enrolled between 2008and 2011. Follow-up ended in February 2013. INTERVENTIONS In the first randomization, 223 patients received 1000mg/m2 weekly of gemcitabine alone and 219 patients received 1000mg/m2 of gemcitabine plus 100mg/d of erlotinib. In the second randomization involving patients with progression-free disease after 4 months, 136 patients received 2 months of the same chemotherapy and 133 underwent chemoradiotherapy (54 Gy plus capecitabine). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas overall survival from the date of the first randomization. Secondary outcomeswere the effect of erlotinib and quality assurance of radiotherapy on overall survival, progression-free survival of gemcitabine-erlotinib and erlotinib maintenance with gemcitabine alone at the second randomization, and toxic effects. RESULTS A total of 442 of the 449 patients (232 men; median age, 63.3 years) enrolled underwent the first randomization. Of these, 269 underwent the second randomization. Interim analysis was performed when 221 patients died (109 in the chemoradiotherapy group and 112 in the chemotherapy group), reaching the early stopping boundaries for futility. With a median follow-up of 36.7 months, the median overall survival from the date of the first randomization was not significantly different between chemotherapy at 16.5 months (95%CI, 14.5-18.5 months) and chemoradiotherapy at 15.2 months (95%CI, 13.9-17.3 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95%CI, 0.79-1.34; P =.83). Median overall survival from the date of the first randomization for the 223 patients receiving gemcitabine was 13.6 months (95%CI, 12.3-15.3 months) and was 11.9 months (95%CI, 10.4-13.5 months) for the 219 patients receiving gemcitabine plus erlotinib (HR, 1.19; 95%CI, 0.97-1.45; P =.09; 188 deaths vs 191 deaths). Chemoradiotherapy was associated with decreased local progression (32%vs 46%, P =.03) and no increase in grade 3 to 4 toxicity, except for nausea. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this open-label, randomized trial involving patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer with disease controlled after 4 months of induction chemotherapy, there was no significant difference in overall survival with chemoradiotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone and there was no significant difference in overall survival with gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine plus erlotinib used as maintenance therapy.Copyright © 2016 American Medical Association.

Purpose: To investigate the efficacy and safety of concurrent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and ipilimumab or nivolumab in patients with untreated melanoma brain metastases. Patients and Methods: Eighty consecutive patients with 326 melanoma brain metastases receiving SRS in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab were identified from an institutional database and retrospectively evaluated. Patients started systemic treatment with intravenous nivolumab or ipilimumab within one week of receiving SRS. Nivolumab was given at doses of 3 mg/kg every two weeks. Ipilimumab was administered up to four doses of 10 mg/kg, one every 3 weeks, then patients had a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks, until disease progression or inacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint of the study was intracranial progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were extracranial PFS, overall survival (OS), and neurological toxicity. Result(s): Eighty patients were analyzed. Forty-five patients received SRS and ipilimumab, and 35 patients received SRS and nivolumab. With a median follow-up of 15 months, the 6-month and 12-month intracranial PFS rates were 69% (95%CI,54-87%) and 42% (95%CI,24-65%) for patients receiving SRS and nivolumab and 48% (95%CI,34-64%) and 17% (95%CI,5-31%) for those treated with SRS and ipilimumab (p = 0.02), respectively. Extracranial PFS and OS were 37 and 78% in SRS and nivolumab group, respectively, and 17 and 68% in SRS and ipilimumab group, respectively, at 12 months. Sub-group analysis showed significantly better intracranial PFS for patients receiving multi-fraction SRS (3 x 9 Gy) compared to single-fraction SRS (70% versus 46% at 6 months, p = 0.01), especially in combination with nivolumab. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 11 (24%) patients treated with SRS and ipilimumab and 6 (17%) patients who received SRS and nivolumab. Radiation-induced brain necrosis (RN) occurred in 15% of patients. Conclusion(s): Concurrent SRS and ipilimumab or nivolumab show meaningful intracranial activity in patients with either asymptomatic and symptomatic melanoma brain metastases, although a subset of patients may develop symptomatic RN.

As patients of all ages are affected, radiation dose is a concern. While follow-up CT examinations lead to high cumulative radiation doses, the ALARA principle states that the applied dose should be as low as possible while maintaining adequate image quality. The aim of this study was to evaluate parameter settings for two commonly used CT scanners to ensure sufficient image quality/diagnostic confidence at a submillisievert dose. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 36 proven COVID-19 cases examined on two different scanners. Image quality was evaluated objectively as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)/contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) measurement and subjectively by two experienced, independent readers using 3-point Likert scales. CT dose index volume (CTDIvol) and dose-length product (DLP) were extracted from dose reports, and effective dose was calculated. Result(s): With the tested parameter settings we achieved effective doses below 1 mSv (median 0.5 mSv, IQR: 0.2 mSv, range: 0.3-0.9 mSv) in all 36 patients. Thirty-four patients had typical COVID-19 findings. Both readers were confident regarding the typical COVID-19 CT-characteristics in all cases (3 +/- 0). Objective image quality parameters were: SNRnormal lung: 17.0 +/- 5.9, CNRGGO/normal lung: 7.5 +/- 5.0, and CNRconsolidation/normal lung: 15.3 +/- 6.1. Conclusion(s): With the tested parameters, we achieved applied doses in the submillisievert range, on two different CT scanners without sacrificing diagnostic confidence regarding COVID-19 findings.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)",Excluded,0.038446587

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate women who were occupationally exposed to electromagnetic fields (EMF) and breast cancer risk. METHOD(S): Women diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 6213) and randomly selected age-matched control subjects (n = 7390) provided breast cancer risk factor information and occupational history. A qualified industrial hygienist classified each job for EMF exposure as background, low, medium, or high. RESULT(S): When compared with the referent of background exposure, the odds ratio adjusted for age and state of residence was 1.06 (95% CI = 0.99-1.14) for low exposure, 1.09 (95% CI = 0.96-1.23) for medium exposure, and 1.16 (95% CI = 0.90-1.50) for high exposure. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings, taken together with previous epidemiological studies, suggest that exposure to EMF in the workplace may be associated with a slight elevation in breast cancer risk. ©2007The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.",Excluded,0.9072194

2635,"Sinonasal cancer: Analysis of oncological failures in 156 consecutive cases. Background Sinonasal cancers are rare and associated with a poor prognosis. The purpose of this study was to report our experience and analyze the risk factors for oncologic failures. Methods A retrospective review of 156 consecutive patients treated with curative intent for sinonasal malignancy between 1995 and 2005 at tertiary cancer center was performed. Demographic, clinical, morphological, and pathological parameters were correlated with oncologic outcomes. Results Complete response was obtained for 134 patients. Sixty-eight patients relapsed, among which 51 had local recurrence. Nine of these 51 patients (17.6%) underwent successful salvage therapy. Five-year local failure and overall survival rates were 50.0% and 61.1%, respectively. Maxillary sinus tumors, intracranial invasion, and N > 0 classification at initial diagnosis were significantly and independently associated with local failure and survival in multivariate analysis. Conclusion Local control after initial treatment is primordial to optimizing outcomes because of the poor results of salvage therapy. Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded,0.040406443
2636,"Dosimetric study of intensity modulated arc therapy for total marrow irradiation. Purpose/Objective(s): In recent years, helical tomotherapy has been used for total bone marrow irradiation for sparing of critical organs. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of intensity-modulated arc therapy (IMAT) for total bone marrow irradiation. Materials/Methods: Three patients who received total marrow irradiation with helical tomotherapy, two females and one male, were selected for this dosimetric study. Each patient had one CT scan with normal breathing from the skull to the mid-thigh, and two CT scans at the end of the expiration and inspiration phases. Contours for target volumes and normal organs were drawn to take into account breathing effects. The target volumes included the bone volume from the skull to the mid-thigh, lymph nodes, and spleen. 12 Gy in 8 fractions was prescribed to the target volumes. Varian RapidArc IMAT plans were generated with the same target volumes as the helical tomotherapy plans. For each patient, 23 normal structures were included in plan optimization, including all the major organs in the body. In helical tomotherapy plans, 5 cm jaw width was used. For IMAT planning, eight arc fields were used for each patient to cover the entire target volumes, with the isocenters aligned along the superior-inferior axis. Both the helical tomotherapy and IMAT plans were normalized to cover 85% of the bone volume by 12 Gy. Result(s): The average values of themean doses to the normal organswere 6.0 Gy, 6.0 Gy, and 5.8Gy in helical tomotherapy plans for the three patients; they were 4.8 Gy, 5.4 Gy, and 5.2 Gy, respectively, in IMAT plans. Of the 63 organs that could be compared pairwise, 43 had lower means using IMATand 17 had lowermeans using tomotherapy.Of the 40 organ pairs whose mean doses differed bymore than 10%, 33 had lower means in IMAT plans.D10 (theminimumdose level covering 10%of the volume) for the bone volume were 13.5 Gy, 13.1 Gy, and 13.5 Gy in helical tomotherapy plans for the three patients, respectively; they were 13.7 Gy, 14.4Gy, and 14.3Gy in IMAT plans. Comparable dose coveragewas achieved by IMAT plans for other target volumes. The average beam-on timewas 19.4minutes for helical tomotherapy and approximately 16 minutes for IMAT. Planning time excluding contouring was approximately 4h for each method. The average monitor unit (MU) in helical tomotherapy plans was 17,207 MU; it was 4,916 MU in IMAT plans. Conclusion(s): Compared to helical tomotherapy plans, IMAT plans showed consistent improvement in sparing of normal organs while delivering a somewhat less homogeneous dose to the target volumes for total bone marrow irradiation. This study indicates that IMAT can be used effectively for total bone marrow irradiation. With either treatment lower extremities are most efficiently treated with conventional open fields.",Excluded,0.03854751
2637,"Alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy for inoperable stage III non- small-cell lung cancer: Long-term results of two phase II GOTHA trials. Purpose/Objective: To report on two consecutive Phase II cooperative trials in which we evaluated the combination of alternating hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy in inoperable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods: Between February 1986 and September 1989, 65 patients were entered in the first trial (GOTHA I), and between December 1989 and October 1992 67 were enrolled in the second trial (GOTHA II). In both protocols, radiotherapy (RT) was administered twice daily, at 6 h intervals, 5 days a week, to a total dose of 63 Gy in 42 fractions of 1.5 Gy. RT was given during weeks 2, 3, 6, and 7, over an elapsed time of 6 weeks. In GOTHA I, three cycles of cisplatin, 60 mg/m2 day 1, mitomycin, 8 mg/m2 day 1, and vindesin 3 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week, were given during weeks 1, 5, and 9; in GOTHA II, cisplatin 70 mg/m2 day 1 and vinblastin 5 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week were given during weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Result(s): With a minimum follow-up of 3 years, the 1-, 2-, 5-, and 8-year overall survival probability was 56% (95% CI 47-64%), 27% (20-35%), 12% (7- 18%) and 9% (3-16%), respectively, with a median survival of 13.6 months (11.4-16.8). Median follow-up for survivors was 6 years (3.3-9.9). There were no survival differences between Stages IIIA and IIIB (p = 0.84), performance status 0, 1, 2 (p = 0.87), sex (p = 0.45) or between the two treatment protocols. At this time, 14 patients are alive, and 118 have died: 102 from NSCLC, 4 from acute toxicity, 2 from secondary surgery, 4 from other medical causes, and 6 from unknown causes. Correlation between response and long- term survival was poor, since of the 24 patients who survived 3 years or more, only 6 (25%) were classified as having a complete response; the remainder having either a partial response (11, 46%), no change (6, 25%), or 'progressive disease' (1,4%). First site of relapse was local in 31% of these cases, distant in 43%, local and distant in 15%, and unknown in 11%. Main grade 3-4 acute toxicities were nausea-vomiting (17%), mucositis (15%), leukopenia (41%), and thrombocytopenia (11%). Eight patients presented with grade 3-4 symptomatic lung radiation pneumopathy. Conclusion(s): Based on this experience with 132 patients, this combination of alternated RT and chemotherapy (CT) for inoperable Stage III NSCLC is feasible with acceptable toxicity, and long-term results suggest a gain in survival when compared to those obtained with conventional RT alone. However, the still high local and distant failure rates indicate that both local and systemic therapies need to be improved.",Excluded,0.03822748
2638,"Evaluation of difluoromethyl ketones as agonists of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptor. The design, synthesis, biological evaluation, and in vivo studies of difluoromethyl ketones as GABAB agonists that are not structurally analogous to known GABAB agonists, such as baclofen or 3-aminopropyl phosphinic acid, are presented. The difluoromethyl ketones were assembled in three synthetic steps using a trifluoroacetate-release aldol reaction. Following evaluation at clinically relevant GABA receptors, we have identified a difluoromethyl ketone that is a potent GABAB agonist, obtained its X-ray structure, and presented preliminary in vivo data in alcohol-preferring mice. The behavioral studies in mice demonstrated that this compound tended to reduce the acoustic startle response, which is consistent with an anxiolytic profile. Structure-activity investigations determined that replacing the fluorines of the difluoromethyl ketone with hydrogens resulted in an inactive analogue. Resolution of the individual enantiomers of the difluoromethyl ketone provided a compound with full biological activity at concentrations less than an order of magnitude greater than the pharmaceutical, baclofen. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",Excluded,0.039656695
2639,"Effects of low-dose and high-dose postoperative radioiodine therapy on the clinical outcome in patients with small differentiated thyroid cancer having microscopic extrathyroidal extension. Background: It is unclear whether differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients classified as intermediate risk based on the presence of microscopic extrathyroidal extension (ETE) should be treated with low or high doses of radioiodine (RAI) after surgery. We evaluated success rates and long-term clinical outcomes of patients with DTC of small tumor size, microscopic ETE, and no cervical lymph node (LN) metastasis treated either with a low (1.1GBq) or high RAI dose (5.5GBq). Method(s): This is a retrospective analysis of a historical cohort from 2000 to 2010 in a tertiary referral hospital. A total of 176 patients with small (<=2cm) DTC, microscopic ETE, and no cervical LN metastasis were included. Ninety-six patients were treated with 1.1GBq (LO group) and 80 patients with 5.5GBq (HI group). Successful RAI therapy was defined as (i) negative stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) in the absence of Tg antibodies, and (ii) absence of remnant thyroid tissue and of abnormal cervical LNs on ultrasonography. Clinical recurrence was defined as the reappearance of disease after ablation, which was confirmed by cytologically or pathologically proven malignant tissue or of distant metastatic lesions. Result(s): There was no significant difference in the rate of successful RAI therapy between the LO and HI groups (p=0.75). In a subgroup analysis based on tumor size, success rates were not different between the LO group (34/35, 97%) and the HI group (50/56, 89%) in patients with a tumor size of 1-2cm (p=0.24). In patients with smaller tumor size (<=1cm), there was no significant difference in success rates between the LO (59/61, 97%) and HI groups (22/24, 92%; p=0.30). No patient had clinical recurrences in either group during the median 7.2 years of follow-up.

Background: The role of irinotecan for elderly patients with LD-SCLC has been unclear, and the timing of TRT combined with chemotherapy has not been fully evaluated. Method(s): Patients aged > 70 years with untreated, measurable, LD-SCLC, performance status (PS) 0-2, and adequate organ function were eligible. Treatment consisted of induction with carboplatin on day 1 and irinotecan on days 1 and 8, every 21 days for 4 cycles, and sequential TRT (54Gy in 27 fractions). Carboplatin doses were based on AUC of 4 and 5 (levels 1 and 2, respectively), with a fixed irinotecan dose (50 mg/m2). Primary objective of the phase II study was overall responce rate. Result(s): Forty-three patients were enrolled and forty-one were finally analyzed (median age: 75 years [range 70-86 years); males 31; PS 0/1/2, n = 22/18/1]. Two patients were excluded because of protocol violation (ascertained to be extensive disease). Twelve patients were accrued at phase I and the number of patients with carboplatin dose-limiting toxicities at levels-1 (n = 6) and -2 (n = 6) were 1(grade 3 hypertension) and 2 (grade 4 thrombocytopenia), respectively. The phase II trial was expanded to 29 additional patients receiving the level 1 carboplatin dose, total of 35 patients. The median number of chemotherapy cycles was 4 (range 1-4), and the median radiation dose was 54Gy (range 36-60). Toxicities were generally mild. There were 4 complete and 27 partial responses (response rate 88.6%). With a median follow-up of 52 months, the median progression-free and overall survival times of phase II were 11.2 and 27.1 months, respectively.

2641,"Local and disease control for nasal melanoma treated with radiation and concomitant anti-programmed death 1 antibody. Mucosal melanoma of the nasal cavity is a rare disease that has been consistently associated with poor outcome. While complete surgical excision offers the only prospect of a cure, it is associated with a high risk of surgical morbidity due to the challenging anatomical location, and most patients still develop incurable metastatic disease. The efficacy of immunotherapy on mucosal melanoma is lower in comparison with cutaneous melanoma, and mucosal melanoma rarely has BRAF mutations. Although preclinical data have shown that combination treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and radiotherapy (RT) improve the response, there have been few reports on the combination of RT and anti-programmed death 1 therapy for mucosal melanoma of the nasal cavity. We retrospectively investigated 10 cases of mucosal melanoma of the nasal cavity in which combined treatment was applied. The local control (LC) rate of the primary lesion and regional lymph nodes was favorably 100%. On the other hand, the median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 29.6 weeks (range, 2-82). The 6-month PFS rate was 60%. Although severe mucositis occurred in one patient, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events was not significantly increased.

2642,"Long-Term Cognitive Functioning in Single-Dose Total-Body Gamma-Irradiated Rhesus Monkeys ( Macaca mulatta ). In this study, the effects of a potentially lethal radiation exposure on the brain for long-term cognitive sequelae were investigated using Rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) adopted from other facilities after analysis of acute radiation response via the Centers for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR) network. Fifty-nine animals were given the opportunity to participate in cognitive cage-side testing. The animals that received single-dose gamma irradiation were significantly less likely to engage in cognitive testing than the controls, suggesting that irradiated animals may have differences in cognitive ability. Five irradiated (6.75-8.05 Gy) and three naive control animals self-selected, were extensively trained and administered a simple visual discrimination with reversal (SVD+R) task 2-3 times per week for 11-18 months. Each session consisted of 30 trials in which the animals were required to choose the correct visual stimulus for a food reward. After the initial presentation, the stimulus that signaled the presence of food was twice reversed once the animal reached criterion (90% accuracy across four consecutive sessions). While the limited sample size precluded definitive statistical analysis, irradiated animals took longer to reach the criterion subsequent to reversal than did control animals, suggesting a relative deficiency in cognitive flexibility. These results provide preliminary data supporting the potential use of a nonhuman primate model to study radiation-induced, late-delayed cognitive deficits.",Included,0.97069407
2643,"Low-dose radiation exposure and protection against atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice: the influence of P53 heterozygosity. We recently described the effects of low-dose gamma-radiation exposures on atherosclerosis in genetically susceptible (ApoE(-/-)) mice with normal p53 function. Doses as low as 25 mGy, given at either early or late stage disease, generally protected against atherosclerosis in a manner distinctly nonlinear with dose. We now report the influence of low doses (25-500 mGy) on atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice with reduced p53 function (Trp53(+/-)). Single exposures were given at either low or high dose rate (1 or 150 mGy/min) to female C57BL/6J ApoE(-/-) Trp53(+/-) mice. Mice were exposed at either early stage disease (2 months of age) and examined 3 or 6 months later, or at late stage disease (7 months of age) and examined 2 or 4 months later. In unirradiated mice, reduced p53 functionality elevated serum cholesterol and accelerated both aortic root lesion growth and severity in young mice. Radiation exposure to doses as low as 25 mGy at early stage disease, at either the high or the low dose rate, inhibited lesion growth, decreased lesion frequency and slowed the progression of lesion severity in the aortic root. In contrast, exposure at late stage disease produced generally detrimental effects. Both low-and high-dose-rate exposures accelerated lesion growth and high dose rate exposures also increased serum cholesterol levels. These results show that at early stage disease, reduced p53 function does not influence the protective effects against atherosclerosis of low doses given at low dose rate. In contrast, when exposed to the same doses at late stage disease, reduced p53 function produced detrimental effects, rather than the protective effects seen in Trp53 normal mice. As in the Trp53 normal mice, all effects were highly nonlinear with dose. These results indicate that variations in p53 functionality can dramatically alter the outcome of a low-dose exposure, and that the assumption of a linear response with dose for human populations is probably unwarranted.",Excluded,0.97070056
2644,"Mediastinal Nodal Involvement After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation for Siewert II/III Adenocarcinoma. Background: Adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (AEG) poses a management challenge, as preoperative prediction of occult mediastinal nodal metastasis is difficult. We sought to identify factors predictive of mediastinal involvement among patients undergoing trimodality therapy. Method(s): Patients undergoing trimodality therapy for Siewert II and III AEG at a single institution between 2000 and 2015 were identified. Mediastinal involvement was defined as pathologic nodal involvement after neoadjuvant chemoradiation (ypN+) in mediastinal stations or mediastinal recurrence 2 years or less after resection. Maximal chi2 analysis and Youden's J index were used to identify the pretreatment proximal tumor extent that best discriminated mediastinal involvement. Result(s): In all, 204 patients (151 [74%] AEG II, 53 [26%] AEG III) were included, of whom 47 (23%) had clinical evidence of thoracic nodal disease. Thirty-one of the 204 patients (15%) met criteria for mediastinal involvement (24 of 31 ypN+, 10 of 31 mediastinal recurrence). Patients with mediastinal involvement had greater proximal tumor extent (median 2 cm [interquartile range, 1.0 to 3.0 cm] vs 1.4 cm [interquartile range, 0.7 to 3.0 cm], P =.030), were more frequently Siewert II lesions (27 of 31 [87.1%] vs 124 of 173 [71.7%], P =.071), and were more often observed to have clinical thoracic nodal metastasis (cN) evidence (13 of 31 [42%] vs 34 of 173 [20%], P =.007) than patients who did not. On multivariable analysis of patients with intrathoracic cN0, esophageal extent of 1.5 cm or greater was independently predictive of mediastinal involvement (odds ratio 5.46, P =.011), whereas Siewert classification was not (Siewert II odds ratio 3.48, P =.116). Conclusion(s): Pretreatment proximal tumor extent, rather than Siewert classification, is an independent predictor of mediastinal involvement among AEG II/III patients without clinical evidence of mediastinal metastasis and should be considered during treatment planning.Copyright © 2019 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons",Excluded,0.038417503
2645,"Empty peek cages in ACDF: Does partial titanium coating improve the radiographic fusion?. BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is an effective standard surgical treatment for radiculopathy and myelopathy. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a popular and advantageous material for the cages used in ACDF, but clinical studies have shown that radiographic fusion is slower with PEEK cages than with titanium cages. In a previous large prospective multicenter study, we showed that empty PEEK cages have slow and insufficient radiographic fusion and that failure to achieve complete radiographic fusion results in less improvement in pain and disability. It was hypothesized that a PEEK cage coated with titanium on the top and bottom surfaces would achieve better radiographic fusion rates than an otherwise identical uncoated PEEK cage. PURPOSE: To determine if a PEEK cage with a titanium coating on the top and bottom surfaces achieves better radiographic fusion than an identical PEEK cage without any titanium coating. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective multicenter single-arm clinical trial, with matched controls from another prospective multicenter singlearm clinical trial. PATIENT SAMPLE: Fifty patients receiving single-level ACDF, for radiculopathy or myelopathy at a single level C3-4 to C7-T1, and 50 matched controls selected from a similar clinical trial. This interim analysis presents results from the first 28 cases and 50 controls, and the presentation at the Annual Meeting will present the full final results of all 50 patients and 50 controls. OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiographic fusion was assessed on X-ray images by two independent investigators for three aspects-bony bridging, subsidence/migration, and range of motion, yielding a 0-7 score, with scores of 6 and 7 defined as ""complete fusion."" Clinical outcomes included Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, Neck Disability Index (NDI) for functioning, and Odom's criterion. METHOD(S): Single-level ACDF was performed using stand-alone empty PEEK cages with versus without titanium coating on the top and bottom surfaces, without postoperative bracing. Follow-up assessments were made at 6, 12, and 18 months. RESULT(S): The rate of complete fusion for PEEK+Ti cages versus uncoated PEEK controls was: 50.0% vs 40.0% at 6 months, 75.0% vs 72.0% at 12 months, and 78.5% vs 84.0% at 18 months, and there was no statistically significant difference between these rates. There was also no statistically significant difference between the two groups for the amount of subsidence at any follow-up. Pain (VAS) and functioning (NDI) improved in both groups with no statistically significant difference between them. The fusion status correlated significantly (p<.05) with VAS at 6 and 18 months and with NDI at 12 and 18 months. The Odom's criterion at 18 months was the same in both groups: ""good"" or ""excellent"" for 89% of PEEK+Ti patients vs 90% for PEEK patients (p=.90). CONCLUSION(S): This interim analysis from our study rejects our hypothesis that titanium coating of PEEK cages at the bearing surface (cage/ vertebra interface) would improve the low fusion rate of empty PEEK cages: neither the speed nor the ultimate frequency of fusion was significantly different between the cases and matched controls. Our study suggests that endplate/interface coating alone does not improve fusion. Perhaps a possible immune response to the remaining uncovered PEEK at the lateral and inner cage surfaces may be a reason for the slow and insufficient rate of fusion. PEEK cages fully coated with titanium should be tested next.",Excluded,0.038572524

2648,"Treatment results of alternating chemoradiotherapy followed by proton beam therapy boost combined with intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy for stage III-IVB tongue cancer. Purpose: Proton beam therapy (PBT), compared with conventional radiotherapy, can deliver high-dose radiation to a tumor, while minimizing doses delivered to surrounding normal tissues. The better dose distribution of PBT may contribute to the improvement in local control rate and reduction in late adverse events. We evaluated therapeutic results and toxicities of PBT combined with selective intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy (PBT-IACT) in patients with stage III-IVB squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. Material(s) and Method(s): After 2 systemic chemotherapy courses and whole-neck irradiation (36 Gy in 20 fractions), we administered concurrent chemoradiotherapy comprising PBT for the primary tumor [28.6-33 Gy(RBE) in 13-15 fractions] and for the metastatic neck lymph node [33-39.6 Gy(RBE) in 15-18 fractions] with weekly retrograde intra-arterial chemotherapy by continuous infusion of cisplatin with sodium thiosulfate. Result(s): Between February 2009 and September 2012, 33 patients were enrolled. The median follow-up duration was 43 months. The 3-year overall survival, progression-free survival, local control rate, and regional control rate for the neck were 87.0, 74.1, 86.6, and 83.9 %, respectively. Major acute toxicities >grade 3 included mucositis in 26 cases (79 %), neutropenia in 17 cases (51 %), and dermatitis in 11 cases (33 %). Late grade 2 osteoradionecrosis was observed in 1 case (3 %).

2649,"Type of interventional pain procedure, body weight, and presence of spinal pathology are determinants of the level of radiation exposure for fluoroscopically guided pain procedures. In the recent years new technology has led to the development of a bewildering array of imaging procedures. Yet, conventional radiography remains one of the most used tools to diagnose and to aid procedural interventions. Fluoroscopy guidance facilitates targeted drug delivery or radiofrequency directly to the area of pathology, a benefit that has to be balanced against the risks of radiation exposure. In this prospective observational survey of routine practice, dose area product (DAP) and screening time (ST) were recorded in 127 consecutive patients undergoing fluoroscopically guided spinal procedures along with other probable measures of potentially greater radiation exposure such as weight, type of spinal pathology, the ease of recognition of the anatomical landmarks, and the radiographic quality of the image in terms of contrast and graininess. The mean ST was 34+/-27 seconds (range, 3 to 218 seconds), the mean DAP was 1.18+/-1.08 Gy cm(2) (range, 0.023 to 6.82 seconds). A correlation between weight and DAP was confirmed (r=0.230, P<0.05, Spearman's correlation coefficient). Patients with spinal pathology (n=33) had higher radiation exposure than those without (DAP median=0.85, U=978.00, P<0.005, r=-0.28, Mann-Whitney test). The DAP values obtained compare favourably with the recommended doses for radiographs and other procedures, although they generally exceed the values for a chest X-ray. Copyright © 2011 The Authors.

2650,"Transcriptional corepressor MTG16 regulates small intestinal crypt proliferation and crypt regeneration after radiation-induced injury. Myeloidtranslocation genes (MTGs) are transcriptional corepressorsimplicated in development, malignancy, differentiation, and stem cellfunction. While MTG16 loss renders mice sensitive to chemicalcolitis, the role of MTG16 in the small intestine is unknown. Histologicalexamination revealed that Mtg16-/- mice have increasedenterocyte proliferation and goblet cell deficiency. After exposure toradiation, Mtg16-/- mice exhibited increased crypt viability anddecreased apoptosis compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Flow cytometricand immunofluorescence analysis of intestinal epithelial cellsfor phospho-histone H2A.X also indicated decreased DNA damageand apoptosis in Mtg16-/- intestines. To determine if Mtg16 deletionaffected epithelial cells in a cell-autonomous fashion, intestinal cryptswere isolated from Mtg16-/- mice. Mtg16-/-and WT intestinalcrypts showed similar enterosphere forming efficiencies when culturedin the presence of EGF, Noggin, and R-spondin. However, whenMtg16-/- crypts were cultured in the presence of Wnt3a, theydemonstrated higher enterosphere forming efficiencies and delayedprogression to mature enteroids. Mtg16-/- intestinal crypts isolatedfrom irradiated mice exhibited increased survival compared with WTintestinal crypts. Interestingly, Mtg16 expression was reduced in astem cell-enriched population at the time of crypt regeneration. Thisis consistent with MTG16 negatively regulating regeneration in vivo.Taken together, our data demonstrate that MTG16 loss promotesradioresistance and impacts intestinal stem cell function, possibly dueto shifting cellular response away from DNA damage-induced apoptosisand towards DNA repair after injury.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.",Included,0.97014916

2652,"Implications of somatic mutations in the AML1 gene in radiation-associated and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia. Somatically acquired point mutations of AML1/RUNX1 gene have been recently identified in rare cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Moreover, germ line mutations of AML1 were found in an autosomal dominant disease, familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML (FPD/AML), suggesting that AML1 mutants, as well as AML1 chimeras, contribute to the transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. In this report, we showed that AML1 point mutations were found in 6 (46%) of 13 MDS patients among atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors in Hiroshima. Unlike acute or chronic leukemia patients among A-bomb survivors, MDS patients exposed relatively low-dose radiation and developed the disease after a long latency period. AML1 mutations also were found in 5 (38%) of 13 therapy-related AML/MDS patients who were treated with alkylating agents with or without local radiation therapy. In contrast, frequency of AML1 mutation in sporadic MDS patients was 2.7% (2 of 74). Among AML1 mutations identified in this study, truncated-type mutants lost DNA binding potential and trans-activation activity. All missense mutations with one exception (Gly42Arg) lacked DNA binding ability and down-regulated the trans-activation potential of wild-type AML1 in a dominant-negative fashion. The Gly42Arg mutation that was shared by 2 patients bound DNA even more avidly than wild-type AML1 and enhanced the trans-activation potential of normal AML1. These results suggest that AML1 point mutations are related to low-dose radiation or alkylating agents and play a role distinct from that of leukemogenic chimeras as a result of chromosomal translocations caused by sublethal radiation or topoisomerase II inhibitors.",Excluded,0.9705146
2653,"IN-VIVO RADIATION DOSIMETRY USING PORTABLE L BAND EPR: ON-SITE MEASUREMENT OF VOLUNTEERS IN FUKUSHIMA PREFECTURE, JAPAN. The aim of this study was to make direct measurements of the possible radiation-induced EPR signals in the teeth of volunteers who were residents in Fukushima within 80 km distance from the Fukushima Nuclear Power plant at the time of the disaster, and continued to live there for at least 3 month after the disaster. Thirty four volunteers were enrolled in this study. These measurements were made using a portable L-band EPR spectrometer, which was originally developed in the EPR Center at Dartmouth. All measurements were performed using surface loop resonators that have been specifically designed for the upper incisor teeth. Potentially these signals include not only radiation-induced signals induced by the incident but also background signals including those from prior radiation exposure from the environment and medical exposure. We demonstrated that it is feasible to transport the dosimeter to the measurement site and make valid measurements. The intensity of the signals that were obtained was not significantly above those seen in volunteers who had not had potential radiation exposures at Fukushima.Copyright © The Author 2016.

2654,"Single- and dual-energy CT of the abdomen: comparison of radiation dose and image quality of 2nd and 3rd generation dual-source CT. Objectives: To compare single-energy (SECT) and dual-energy (DECT) abdominal CT examinations in matched patient cohorts regarding differences in radiation dose and image quality performed with second- and third-generation dual-source CT (DSCT). Method(s): We retrospectively analysed 200 patients (100 male, 100 female; mean age 61.2 +/- 13.5 years, mean body mass index 27.5 +/- 3.8 kg/m2) equally divided into four groups matched by gender and body mass index, who had undergone portal venous phase abdominal CT with second-generation (group A, 120-kV-SECT; group B, 80/140-kV-DECT) and third-generation DSCT (group C, 100-kV-SECT; group D, 90/150-kV-DECT). The radiation dose was normalised for 40-cm scan length. Dose-independent figure-of-merit (FOM) contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated for various organs and vessels. Subjective overall image quality and reader confidence were assessed. Result(s): The effective normalised radiation dose was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in groups C (6.2 +/- 2.0 mSv) and D (5.3 +/- 1.9 mSv, P = 0.103) compared to groups A (8.8 +/- 2.3 mSv) and B (9.7 +/- 2.4 mSv, P = 0.102). Dose-independent FOM-CNR peaked for liver, kidney, and portal vein measurements (all P <= 0.0285) in group D. Subjective image quality and reader confidence were consistently rated as excellent in all groups (all >=1.53 out of 5). Conclusion(s): With both DSCT generations, abdominal DECT can be routinely performed without radiation dose penalty compared to SECT, while third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency. Key Points: * Dual-source CT (DSCT) allows for single- and dual-energy image acquisition. * Dual-energy acquisition does not increase the radiation dose in abdominal DSCT. * Third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency compared to second-generation DSCT. * Dose-independent figure-of-merit image contrast was highest with third-generation dual-energy DSCT. * Third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency for SECT and DECT.Copyright © 2016, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded,0.038367566

PURPOSE: The effect of total-body irradiation (TBI) on the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of (111)In-DTPA-labeled pegylated liposomes (IDLPL) was evaluated in tumor-bearing nude mice as part of an ongoing effort to develop liposome-targeted radiosensitizers., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Mice received TBI (2 Gy or 5 Gy) according to two protocols: (1) to test the effect of radiation delivered 30 min before liposome injection on the time course of IDLPL biodistribution to tumor and normal tissues over 96 h; (2) to test the effect of radiation at times ranging from 72 h to 1 h before liposome injection on tumor and normal tissue uptake of IDLPL at 24 h. Tumor and tissue/organ levels of liposome uptake were measured by dissection and quantitation in a gamma counter., RESULTS: For most tissues (tumor, liver, kidney, lung, skin, heart, and central nervous system), irradiation did not alter IDLPL biodistribution. Splenic uptake appeared to be increased by TBI, but further analysis revealed that this effect was due to reduced splenic weight in irradiated mice. IDLPL uptake was increased in the small intestine, stomach, musculoskeletal system, female reproductive tract, and adrenal glands in irradiated mice., CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that concomitant administration of liposomal radiosensitizers during radical radiotherapy is likely to be safe. However, caution should be exercised in situations in which significant volumes of small intestine or hemopoietic tissue will be irradiated.",Excluded,0.9701404

PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of focal X-ray irradiation on experimental corneal angiogenesis in the rabbit., METHODS: A gelatin hydrogel sheet impregnated with basic fibroblast growth factor was implanted into the corneal stroma of rabbits; this induced corneal angiogenesis. After the first sign of corneal angiogenesis was noted, the corneal region was irradiated with a dose of 10 Gy or 20 Gy. The control rabbits received no irradiation. The eyes were examined by slitlamp biomicroscopy and photographed, over a period of 28 days. The maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were quantified by computerized image analysis., RESULTS: Corneal angiogenesis was noted on day 3 following implantation of the hydrogel sheet. In the rabbits irradiated with 10 Gy, the maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were both significantly lower on day 4 and 7 following irradiation, compared to the respective measurement in the controls. In the rabbits irradiated with 20 Gy, the maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were significantly lower between days 4 and 21, and between days 4 and 14, respectively, compared to the respective measurement in the controls., CONCLUSIONS: Focal X-ray irradiation to the corneal region suppressed corneal angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner.

A cell culture assay has been developed that detects and validates single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that populate the p53 pathway. One hundred thirteen EBV-transformed human B-lymphocyte cell lines obtained from a diverse population were employed to measure the apoptotic response to gamma radiation. Each cell line undergoes a reproducible, characteristic frequency of apoptosis, and the response of the population forms a normal distribution around a median of 35.5% apoptosis with a range from 12% to 58% apoptosis. Polymorphisms in the AKT1 and Perp genes significantly affect the frequency of apoptosis. The assay can detect both racial and sexual dimorphisms in these genes and has the ability to demonstrate epistatic relationships within the p53 pathway. The cell lines used in this assay provide biological materials to explore the molecular basis of the polymorphisms.Copyright © 2005 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",Included,0.96852344

The purpose of this study was to determine the procedural complication rate, patency, and clinical outcomes after carotid angioplasty and stent placement in this small group of high-risk patients., METHODS: Sixteen patients (mean age, 65 years; 5 women and 11 men) who received radiation therapy for head and/or neck malignancy subsequently developed carotid stenosis (mean, 84%; range, 70%-99%) in a total of 19 carotid arteries, which were treated with angioplasty and stent placement. The patients were followed for a mean time of 28 months (range, 5-78 months) with periodic Doppler studies, angiography, CT angiography, or clinically., RESULTS: In the total 19 stented carotid arteries, 23 procedures were performed (22 stent placement procedures and one repeat angioplasty). The procedural stroke rate was 1/23 (4%). The procedural transient ischemic attack rate was 0/23 (0%). There was one other observed complication: a puncture site hematoma. The 30-day postprocedure complication rate was 0/23 (0%); no neurologic symptoms were reported. Fifteen of the 19 vessels (79%) developed no new stenosis throughout the follow-up period. Two of 19 (11%) vessels had repeat angioplasty and stent placement; 1/19 (5%) had a repeat angioplasty. One restented vessel has remained patent for 50 months. Another restented vessel required a third stent placement 17 months after the second.

2661,"A multicenter study comparing the outcome of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation between cryoballoon and radiofrequency ablation in patients with heart failure (CRABL-HF): Study design. Background: Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly performed worldwide in patients with heart failure (HF). However, it has been recently emphasized that AF ablation in patients with HF is associated with increased risks of procedure-related complications and mortality. There are little data about the differences in the efficacy and safety between cryoballoon (CB) and radiofrequency (RF) ablation of AF in patients with HF. Method(s): The CRABL-HF study is designed as a prospective, multicenter, open-label, controlled, and randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of AF ablation between CB and RF ablation in patients with HF (LVEF <=40%) (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000032433). The CRABL-HF study will consist of 110 patients at multicenter in Japan. The patients will be registered and randomly assigned to either the CB ablation or RF ablation group with a 1:1 allocation. The primary endpoint of this study is the occurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATs) at 1 year with a blanking period of 90 days after ablation. Key secondary endpoints are the success rate of the pulmonary vein isolation, total procedural time, left atrial dwelling time, total fluoroscopy time, radiation exposure, complication rate, composite of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalizations, cardiovascular events, change in left ventricular ejection fraction, and change in quality of life. Result(s): The results of this study are currently under investigation.

Purpose: A phase I/II study on carbon ion radiotherapy for Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was first conducted between 1994 and 1999 and determined the optimal dose. Second, a Phase II study using the optimal dose was performed. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the local control and 5-year survival rates. Methods and Materials: Between April 1999 and December 2000, 50 patients with 51 primary lesions were treated. Using a fixed dose of 72 GyE in nine fractions over 3 weeks, the primary tumors were irradiated with carbon ion beams alone. The average age of the patients was 74.5 years. Thirty-three (66%) of these were medically inoperable. Local control and survival were determined by using the Kaplan-Meier method and the data were statistically processed by using the log-rank test. Result(s): All patients were observed for a minimum of 5 years or until death with a median follow-up time of 59.2 months (range, 6.0-83.0 months). The local control rate for all patients was 94.7%. The patients' 5-year cause-specific survival rate was 75.7% (IA: 89.4; IB: 55.1), and overall survival 50.0% (IA: 55.2; IB: 42.9). No toxic reactions in the lung greater than Grade 3 were detected. Conclusion(s): Carbon ion radiotherapy, a new treatment modality with superior benefits in terms of quality of life and activity of daily living, has been proven as a valid alternative to surgery for Stage I NSCLC and to offer particular benefits, especially for elderly and inoperable patients. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Background The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative complications and nutritional status between esophagogastrostomy and double-tract reconstruction in patients who underwent laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy, and assess the advantages of both surgical procedures. Methods Between 2010 and 2018, 47 cases underwent proximal gastrectomy with esophagogastrostomy (n = 23) or double-tract reconstruction (n = 24) at our institu-tion for the treatment of clinical T1N0 adenocarcinoma located in the upper third of the stomach. Patient clinical characteristics, short-term outcomes, nutrition status, and skeletal muscle index were compared among the two groups. Results There was no significant difference between esophagogastrostomy and double-tract reconstruction in terms of operation time, blood loss, and length of postoperative hospital stay. Reflux symptoms and anastomotic stenosis were significantly higher in the esophagogastrostomy group compared with the double-tract reconstruction group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). There was no significant difference in anastomotic leakage, surgical site infection, and pancre-atic fistula. For the nutritional status, the decrease rate of cholinesterase was significantly higher in the esopha-gogastrostomy group compared with the double-tract reconstruction group at 6 months (P = 0.008) There was no significant difference in the decrease rate of skeletal muscle mass index at 1 year after surgery. Conclusion Compared with esophagogastrostomy, double-tract reconstruction tends to have better short-term nutritional status and postoperative outcomes in terms of preventing the occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux and anastomosis stenosis. These findings suggest that double-tract reconstruction may be a useful method in laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy.Copyright © 2020 Tottori University Medical Press.",Excluded,0.038483147

In a retrospective study, two mandibular prosthetic rehabilitation strategies supported by implants in oral cancer patients were evaluated: implants placed in the non-resected edentulous symphyseal area during ablative surgery (DAS implants); or at a later stage (postponed (P) implants). Medical files of patients from two head-neck oncology groups from 2000 to 2005 were screened for study inclusion. DAS protocol was used in one group and P protocol in the other. After a 5 year follow-up of 261 edentulous patients with oral cancer in the second group, P implants were placed in 27 patients to support an overdenture. Of the 249 edentulous patients in the first group, 82 patients were given an implant supported overdenture using the DAS implant protocol. Regarding implant loss, no statistically significant differences were seen between the DAS and P implants. In the DAS group, more patients benefited from an implant-supported lower overdenture (39 versus 11%, respectively), and they received their overdenture on average 20.0 months sooner (sd=11.01, p<0.001) after ablative surgery. 17.1% of DAS implants and 4.6% of P implants were never loaded due to tumour and patient related factors including unfavourable implant soft tissue, tumour recurrence near the implant, or radiotherapy induced trismus.

PURPOSE: To characterize the relationship between radiation pneumonitis (RP) clinical symptoms and pulmonary metabolic activity on post-treatment [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 101 esophageal cancer patients who underwent restaging FDG-PET/computed tomography imaging 3-12 weeks after completing thoracic radiotherapy. The National Institutes of Health Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3, was used to score the RP clinical symptoms. Linear regression was applied to the FDG-PET/computed tomography images to determine the normalized FDG uptake vs. radiation dose. The pulmonary metabolic radiation response (PMRR) was quantified as this slope. Modeling was performed to determine the interaction of PMRR, mean lung dose (MLD), and the percentage of lung receiving >20 Gy with RP outcomes., RESULTS: Of the 101 patients, 25 had Grade 0, 10 had Grade 1, 60 had Grade 2, 5 had Grade 3, and 1 had Grade 5 RP symptoms. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that increased values of both MLD and PMRR were associated with a greater probability of RP clinical symptoms (p = 0.032 and p = 0.033, respectively). Spearman's rank correlation found no association between the PMRR and the dosimetric parameters (planning target volume, MLD, percentage of lung receiving >5-30 Gy). Twofold cross-validation demonstrated that the combination of MLD and PMRR was superior to either alone for assessing the development of clinical RP symptoms. The combined MLD (or percentage of lung receiving >20 Gy) and PMRR had a greater sensitivity and accuracy (53.3% and 62.5%, respectively) than either alone., CONCLUSION: The results of this study have demonstrated a significant correlation between RP clinical symptoms and the PMRR measured by FDG-PET/computed tomography after thoracic radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.04774146

Purpose: There is no agreement within the radiation oncology and ophthalmic communities regarding the treatment of lymphoid lesions of the orbit and ocular adnexa. The authors report their experience with the use of low-dose radiation therapy for malignant and benign lymphoid masses of the orbital region in a series of 54 patients treated between 1985 and 1993. Method(s): All patients received 2 Gy per day for a total of 24 Gy, except when the lesion was extensive, in which case the therapy was 1.5 Gy per day for a total of 25.5 Gy. A diagnosis was established by incisional surgical biopsy in 26 patients and aspiration cytology in 28 patients. Those with a malignant or an indeterminate diagnosis were evaluated with a modified Ann Arbor staging system. Result(s): Low-dose radiation therapy produced a complete response in 100% of the orbital lymphoid lesions. This local control was maintained in 52 patients (96%) for the first year and in 51 patients (95%) for 5 or more years with a mean follow-up of 7 years. One patient died of causes unrelated to the malignant lymphoma after the first year of observation. The mean age of the 54 patients was 67 years, and the range was 37 to 90 years. The mean ages of presentation for each location were: orbit, 67 years; conjunctiva, 68 years; lacrimal gland, 66 years; and eyelids, 72 years. The female-to-male ratio was 1.25:1 (34 women and 20 men). In this series, 9 patients had benign processes, 38 patients had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 7 patients had abnormalities of indeterminate cause. All histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the orbit responded equally well to therapy. Forty-five patients had clinically staged disease as follows: stage I, 21 patients; stage II, 4 patients; stage III, 2 patients; and stage IV, 18 patients. Benign disease, diagnosed in 9 patients, was not staged. Conclusion(s): Low-dose radiation therapy proved effective in treating lymphoid lesions of the orbital area.

Purpose: The treatment of wound healing disturbances of the radial forearm free flap donor site after reconstructive surgery is typically long and burdensome and often requires additional surgery. Cold atmospheric plasma is a promising approach to overcome these impairments. The aim of this proof of concept study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of plasma irradiation in patients with wound healing disorders with exposed brachial tendons of the radial forearm. Patients and Methods: Four patients (mean age 64.2 years, range 44 to 80) who had undergone radial forearm free flap procedures and developed wound healing disturbance leading to exposed flexor tendons were included in the present prospective case series. In addition to routine wound care, all sites were irradiated with cold atmospheric plasma. The primary outcome variable was complete wound closure. Result(s): In all patients, complete wound repair in terms of the absence of tendon exposure was observed within a mean treatment time of 10.1 weeks (range 4.9 to 16). No undesirable side effects were observed, and no inflammation or infection occurred. Conclusion(s): Cold atmospheric plasma could offer a reliable conservative treatment option for complicated wound healing disturbances.

Background: Although positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) seems to be able to provide accurate information of lymph nodes status in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, we sometimes experience surgical cases with unexpected lymph nodes metastasis. The objective of this study is to demonstrate clinicopathological characteristics of patients with unexpected pathological (p) N1 and N2 NSCLC. Method(s): All patients with lung cancer underwent enhanced CT of the chest and PET/CT preoperatively for evaluating of lymph node status. Mediastinoscopy or EBUS-TBNA was not routinely performed. Unexpected pN1 and pN2 diseases were defined as surgical cases which were proved to have hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis postoperatively in spite of negative 18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake in hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes on preoperative PET/CT. We retrospectively reviewed clinical features of these patients and analyze predictive factors for these unexpected diseases.

Tumor size ranged from 12 to 52 mm, and pathological T factor was pT1a in 3, pT1b in 5, pT2a in 19, pT2b in 3, and pT3 in 1. Histological type of the primary tumor were adenocarcinoma in 28 (90%), squamous cell carcinoma in 2, and large cell carcinoma in 1. Among 28 adenocarcinomas, the most common predominant subtype was papillary (20 patients; 71%), followed by acinar (5 patients), solid with mucin, micropapillary, and invasive mucinous (one patient, respectively). Of these patients, 7 patients had micropapillary component in varying proportions in their tumors. EGFR gene mutation status was available in 22 patients, and of these, 12 patients (55%) had tumors with EGFR gene mutation, consisting of exon 19 deletion in 5, exon 21 point mutation in 5, and other minor mutation in 1. In univariate analysis, tumor size (> 3cm), pleural, and lymphatic invasion were significant predictive factors for unexpected pN1 and pN2 diseases. Only in 151 adenocarcinomas, papillary predomiant tumor and having micropapillary component were significant predictive factors for unexpected lymph node metastasis. Conclusion(s): We should take care that false-negative rate is relatively high on preoperative PET/CT for lymph node status in NSCLC. Histological findings of the primary tumor are often important because they can provide predictive information for lymph nodes status even if there is no FDG uptake in regional lymph nodes on preoperative PET/CT.

2674,"Molecular basis of basal cell carcinogenesis in the atomic-bomb survivor population: p53 and PTCH gene alterations. Epidemiological studies suggest that UV exposure from sunlight is the major etiology for skin cancers, both melanocytic and non-melanocytic. However, the radiation-related risk for skin cancer among atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is primarily derived from the excess risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), with no demonstrable excess in squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma. The BCCs in this cohort are therefore unusual in being potentially attributable to two types of radiation - UV and ionizing (IR). BCCs have been associated with PTCH and/or p53 tumor suppressor gene alterations. To investigate the roles of these genes in relation to IR and UV exposures, we analyzed both genes in BCC samples from atomic bomb survivors. We examined 47 tumors, of which 70% had non-silent base-substitution p53 mutations independent of IR or UV exposure. However, the distribution of mutation type depends on UV and/or IR exposure. For example, C-to-T transitions at CpG sites adjacent to pyrimidine-pyrimidine (PyPy) sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-exposed than UV-shielded body areas and CpG-mutations at non-PyPy sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-shielded body areas with high-IR (>=1 Gy) than low-IR (<0.2 Gy) exposure. And notably, although p53 deletion-frequencies demonstrated no IR-dose associations, deletions at the PTCH locus were more frequent (79% versus 44%) in tumors with high-IR than low-IR exposure. Moreover, 60% of high-IR tumors harbored both p53 and PTCH abnormalities compared with 23% of low-IR tumors. Therefore, alteration of both genes is likely to play a role in radiation-induced basal cell carcinogenesis. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",Excluded,0.97060883
2675,"Cancers after renal transplantation in Tunisia: Multicenter experience. Introduction: Renal transplant recipients are at higher risk of certain tumors such as lymphomas and skin cancers than the general and dialysis populations. Method(s): We retrospectively studied the prevalence of tumors in adult renal transplant recipients in five Tunisian centers of transplantation in Tunis, Monastir, sousse and Sfax from January 1986 to January 2008. Result(s): The study included 52 patients; 32 men and 20 women with a mean age of 36 years (range from 18-54 years). The mean time since dialysis to transplantation was 46 months (20-236 months). Induction therapy was based on thymoglobulin in 100 % and administered in a mean course of 12.4 days in 82,2 % of the patients. Maintenance therapy was based on calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) in 91,2 % of cases, on antimetabolites and corticosteroids in 100 % of cases. Acute rejection occurred in 36 of these cases and was treated with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies on 40 % of cases. Incidence of cancer among our population was 6,6 % and occurred after a mean period of 55,4 months of transplantation for solid tumors and 99 months for skin tumors. Eighty three percent of the tumors were solid, and the rest were in the skin. Kaposi sarcoma formed 58.6 % and non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma 21.7 % of the solid tumors, while spinocellular carcinoma formed 83% and basocellular carcinoma 17% of the skin tumors. Switching CNI to sirolimus in 8.3% cases was associated with a favorable outcome. Mortality was the outcome in 28.3% of the patients with cancer, while partial or complete regression of cancers was observed in 54.7% cases after decreasing the doses of the immunosuppressive medications. Conclusion(s): We conclude that post renal transplant cancer is mainly characterized by the predominance of Kaposi sarcoma favored by solar exposure and excessive Induction and maintenance immunosuppression. Careful follow-up may results in early intervention and decrease mortality.",Excluded,0.03828624
2676,"Feasibility and clinical value of computed tomography-guided125I brachytherapy for pain palliation in patients with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases. Aims: The aim was to evaluate the feasibility and clinical value of computed tomography (CT)-guided125 I brachytherapy for pain palliation in patients with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 23 patients with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases and those who had moderate-to-severe pain from January 2014 to December 2018 were enrolled in the study. The primary tumors included pancreatic (n = 12), gastric (n = 4), hepatocellular (n = 4), colorectal (n = 2), and esophageal carcinomas (n= 1). Patients were treated with CT-guided percutaneous125 I brachytherapy during the study. The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form was used to record and compare pain intensity and interference by pain. Treatment-related complications were also evaluated according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 22.0 Results: The primary success rate of125 I seed implantation was 95.7% (22 of the 23 patients). As pain evolved, the patients achieved obvious pain palliation ratings for 'worst pain' and 'average pain' at 72 h and 4 weeks after brachytherapy, respectively, whereas 'pain right now' at 12 weeks was significantly relieved after brachytherapy. No serious complications developed during the perioperative period. Conclusion(s): In the treatment of intractable carcinomatous pain in patients with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases, CT-guided125 I brachytherapy is a feasible and effective modality for pain palliation.Copyright © 2020 Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Excluded,0.039134108
2677,"Impact of gamma irradiation on the development and reproduction of Culex pipiens (Diptera; Culicidae). Purpose: The aim was to evaluate the effects of irradiation of Culex pipiens irradiated as pupae on the larval and pupal mortality percentages, the larval and pupal duration, adult emergence percentages and ovarian development in comparison with the un-irradiated group. Material(s) and Method(s): The mosquito, C. pipiens Linnaeus (L) was irradiated as pupae with three gamma doses 40, 60 and 80 Gy. Different biological aspects include the ovarian development of irradiated females tested. Result(s): Gamma doses used significantly increased the larval and pupal mortality percentages, the larval and pupal duration and significantly decreased the adult emergence percentages. Moreover, fecundity and egg hatchability percentages were severely decreased with increasing gamma doses. While the sterility% was positively correlated with the doses used. Gamma doses caused a dose-dependent decrease in the number of developed eggs, reduction in the number of developed oocytes, signs of degenerative processes in oocytes, yolk mass and egg size decrease. Conclusion(s): Results obtained indicated that gamma radiation of C. pipiens induced remarkable effects on the biological, developmental and reproductive activity.© 2018, Copyright © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded,0.9707365
2678,"Proton beam therapy versus stereotactic body radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: Practice patterns, outcomes, and the effect of biologically effective dose escalation. Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and proton beam therapy (PBT) generally are safe and effective for non-operative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, data comparing the two modalities are limited. We aimed to identify the practice patterns and outcomes of nonsurgical HCC cases treated definitively with either SBRT or PBT. Method(s): We queried the National Cancer Database for T1-2N0 HCC patients receiving PBT or SBRT from 2004 to 2015. Patients were excluded for any treatment other than non-palliative external beam radiotherapy. A multivariable binomial regression model identified patterns of SBRT/PBT use, and propensity-matched multivariable Cox regression assessed correlates of survival. Result(s): A total of 71 patients received PBT and 918 patients received SBRT (median follow-up 45 months). SBRT was used in 1.8% of nonoperative early stage HCC cases in 2004 and 4.2% of cases in 2015, whereas PBT was used in 0.1-0.2% of cases every year. The median biologically effective dose (BED) for SBRT and PBT was 100 Gy10 and 98 Gy10, respectively (OR =0.70, P=0.17). Factors predictive of receiving PBT included: white race, higher comorbidity score, higher education, metropolitan residence, tumors >5 cm and recent treatment (all P<0.05). Both PBT (HR =0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.78) and BED >=100 Gy10 (HR =0.61, 95% CI: 0.38-0.98) were independent predictors for longer survival. Conclusion(s): Although not implying causation and requiring prospective corroboration, PBT was independently associated with longer survival than SBRT, despite being delivered to HCC patients with multiple poor prognostic factors. PBT may also allow for safer BED escalation, which also independently associated with outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.",Excluded,0.0390043
2679,"Plasma concentration of Donepezil did not accurately predict tissue concentration: A dynamic whole-body PET study in humans. Background: Donepezil hydrochloride (DNP) is acetylcholine esterase inhibitor most prescribed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We previously reported its accumulation to brain, myocardium, and pancreas using PET with 11C-DNP. Objects: The purpose of this study was to reveal whether the DNP concentration in these organs could be predicted by measuring its plasma concentration. Method(s): Ten healthy volunteers (5 men and 5 women, age range from 40 to 58 year old, mean age 48.3 year old) were enrolled. 11C-DNP (220 MBq, less than 7mug) was intravenously infused for 1 min immediately followed by 7 repeated whole-body scans (7 min data acquisition in each scan) for 60 min. Radioactivity concentration in brain, pancreas, and myocardium was measured by PMOD software. Time activity curve (TAC) in plasma obtained from arterialized venous blood was measured at 10 time points. Metabolite fraction was measured at 30 min by using HPLC. We assumed linear increase in metabolite fraction during scanning and obtained metabolite-corrected TAC (cTAC) of 11C-DNP. We examined the correlation between integrated TAC and tissue radioactivity of brain, pancreas, and myocardium. We also examined the correlation between plasma radioactivity at single time point and tissue radioactivity in these organs. Result(s): There was no significant correlation between integrated plasma radioactivity (0 to 30 min, 0 to 50 min) and tissue radioactivity at 30 min or 50 min in brain (p=0.066, p = 0.096), pancreas (p=0.156, p=0.162), and myocardium (p=0.308, p=0.481). Metabolite fraction of 11CDNP in plasma was 21.2 +/- 8.6% at 30 min. By using cTAC, we also found no significant correlation between plasma and tissue radioactivity. Conclusion(s): Although plasma concentration has been usually employed to predict tissue concentration of drugs, in case of DNP, plasma concentration did not accurately estimate tissue concentration. PET with positron emitting nuclide-labeled drug may provide more accurate and direct information on the tissue concentration of drugs.",Excluded,0.038440198
2680,"Feasibility study of postoperative intraperitoneal hyperthermochemotherapy by radiofrequency capacitive heating system for advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal seeding. Background: Gastric carcinoma patients with peritoneal dissemination have an extremely poor prognosis. Attempting to improve regional control and decrease the risk of complications related to hyperthermic chemotherapy, we applied a new treatment modality using a combination of gastrectomy with postoperative intraperitoneal hyperthermo-chemotherapy (PIHC) using Thermotron RF-8. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of PIHC in advanced gastric carcinoma patients with peritoneal seeding. Patients and Methods: Between March 2002 and April 2006, 20 gastric carcinoma patients with peritoneal dissemination were allocated to two groups in the patient's selection. The PIHC group (10 patients) received a 60-min PIHC with a cisplatin dose of 80 mg/m2 two weeks after surgery, and the control group (10 patients) received surgery alone. Thermotron RF-8 is a heating device that can raise temperatures in both superficial and deep-seated tumours using 8 MHz radiofrequency electromagnetic waves as a source of heat. Result(s): No patients in either group had life-threatening complications. The most frequent nonhaematologic toxicity (grade 3) was nausea. The one-, two-, and three-year cumulative survival rates for the PIHC group were 60%, 48%, and 36%, respectively, whereas those for the control group were 40%, 10%, and 0%, respectively. The survival rates for the PIHC group were significantly higher than those for the control group.

2681,"Surgical Risk and Survival Associated With Less Invasive Surgery for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma. We compared less invasive surgery with conventional surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with MPM who received surgery at Hyogo College of Medicine between July 2004 and April 2016. Patients underwent multimodal treatment comprising chemotherapy (neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant) and surgery with or without 54 Gy hemithoracic radiotherapy. Patients were grouped into 3 groups according to the surgery intended: Conventional extrapleural pneumonectomy was intended in Group 1 (until August 2009); less invasive extrapleural pneumonectomy was intended in Group 2 (after September 2009); pleurectomy/decortication was intended in Group 3 (after September 2012). We included 152 patients (median age 64 [37-71] years; 131 men, 21 women), mostly with epithelioid subtypes (91.4%). Of them, 149 (98.0%) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 117 (77.0%) underwent surgery (60 had extrapleural pneumonectomy and 57 had pleurectomy/decortication). Macroscopic complete resection was achieved in 94.9% (111/117), and the mortality rates at 30 and 90 days were 1.7% (2/117) and 3.4% (4/117), respectively. The overall median survival time and progression-free survival for all 152 patients were 34.9 and 17.4 months.

2682,"Minimal erythema dose (MED) in normal canine skin by irradiation of narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB). Narrow-band UVB (NB-UVB) is light over a very narrow band of wavelengths (around 311 nm) that is concentrated in the therapeutic range and minimally in the sunburn range. It has therefore become the phototherapy treatment of choice for skin diseases. The minimal erythema dose (MED) on canine skin for standardizing dosage schedules in NB-UVB treatment and histopathological analyses were performed in these dogs. In all 32 dogs tested, the MED ranged from 432 to 864 mJ/cm2. There were no significant differences in MED among breeds, sex and age groups. Histopathology obtained from areas irradiated by MED showed only mild vascular dilatation.

2683,"Forward-Projected Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction in Screening Low-Dose Chest CT: Comparison With Adaptive Iterative Dose Reduction 3D. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to compare forward-projected model-based iterative reconstruction solution (FIRST), a newer fully iterative CT reconstruction method, with adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D (AIDR 3D) in low-dose screening CT for lung cancer. Differences in image noise, image quality, and pulmonary nodule detection, size, and characterization were specifically evaluated., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Low-dose chest CT images obtained for 50 consecutive patients between December 2015 and January 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Images were reconstructed using FIRST and AIDR 3D for both lung and soft-tissue reconstruction. Images were independently reviewed to assess image noise, subjective image quality (with use of a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 denoting far superior image quality; 2, superior quality; 3, equivalent quality; 4, inferior quality; and 5, far inferior quality), pulmonary nodule count, size of the largest pulmonary nodule, and characterization of the largest pulmonary nodule (i.e., solid, part solid, or ground glass)., RESULTS: Across all 50 cases, measured image noise was lower with FIRST than with AIDR 3D (lung window, 44% reduction, 41 +/- 7 vs 74 +/- 8 HU, respectively; soft-tissue window, 32% reduction, 11 +/- 2 vs 16 +/- 2 HU, respectively). Readers subjectively rated images obtained with FIRST as comparable to images obtained with AIDR 3D (mean [+/- SD] Likert score for FIRST vs AIDR 3D, 3.2 +/- 0.3 for soft-tissue reconstructions and 3.0 +/- 0.3 for lung reconstructions). For each reader, very good agreement regarding nodule count was noted between FIRST and AIDR 3D (interclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.83 for reader 1 and 0.78 for reader 2).

Background: Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is considered as the method of choice for treatment of most stone diseases. The present study aims to evaluate radiation dose received by patients undergoing ESWL. Method(s): In total, 46 patients from both genders were referred to the Shohadaye Ashayer hospital of Khorramabad, Iran and were included in the present study. Patients were positioned in anteroposterior (AP) projection and along 30degree anterior oblique (AO) projection upon the X-ray fluoroscopy table and exposures were conducted. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were used for radiation dose measurements. To evaluate the entrance surface dose (ESD), each TLD chip was taped on back of patient at the entrance surfaces of the X-ray beam. Result(s): The mean number of stones in each patient was 1.4. The stone sizes ranged from 7 to 29 mm, and a mean of 3200 pulses were need for each patient. The mean ESD in the postero-anterior (PA) and oblique X-ray beam entrance were obtained at 12.04 and 68.84 mGy, respectively. There was linear correlation between patient dose with fluoroscopy time, tube current (mA), tube potential (kVp) and patient position (P < 0.001); however, we found no strong correlation between patient dose with patient body mass (P = 0.837), number of shock wave pulses (P = 0.089), stone size (P = 0.773) and locations (P = 0.463). Conclusion(s): The data obtained in the current study are comparable with information available in the literature. They emphasized that ESWL exposes patients to much more radiation compared to those from conventional radiography and is in the range of computed tomography (CT) procedures.

After chest roentgenography and abdominopelvic CT, 99mTc-88BV59 was administered intravenously, planar and SPECT external imaging was performed 3 to 6 hr after injection and planar imaging was performed 18 to 24 hr after injection. Surgery was performed immediately after late planar imaging. OPS of a standardized list of sites to document background radiation activity and of tumor sites, resection margins and tumor beds was performed., RESULTS: The patients had 23 histologically proven tumor sites. Overall sensitivity for CT, planar RIS, SPECT, surgery and OPS was 43%, 61%, 78%, 96% and 91%, respectively. SPECT was superior to CT for imaging extrahepatic abdominal and pelvic disease. OPS detected all liver and extrahepatic abdominal tumor sites and correctly predicted histological tumor-free margins and tumor beds in all cases. OPS did not identify tumor deposits that the surgeon could neither see nor feel. No patient demonstrated human anti-human immune responsiveness 1 and 3 mo after 99mTc-88BV59 infusion., CONCLUSION: Technetium-99m-88BV59 is a safe, effective radioimmunoconjugate for colorectal cancer imaging, with superior sensitivity as compared to CT.",Excluded,0.03829695

Purpose/Objective(s): Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a relatively rare cutaneous malignancy that primarily affects the genital regions, such as the vulva and scrotum, of the elderly. Although wide surgical excision is the standard curative treatment for EMPD, it is frequently unsuitable due to old age or severe coexisting disease. Radiation therapy is considered a possible treatment option for these patients, but to date there have been few studies that have presented treatment results. Consequently, we have investigated the outcome of radiation therapy in EMPD. Materials/Methods: Thirty-six patients with EMPD received radiation therapy with curative intent. Of these patients, 13 were men and 23 were women, and their median age at irradiation was 74 years (range, 52-94 years). The primary tumor sites were the perineum in 13 patients, vulva in 12, scrotum in 10, and penis in one. Twelve patients had regional lymph node metastases prior to radiation therapy, but none had distant metastasis. Total radiation doses of 45-80.2 Gy (median, 60 Gy) were delivered to tumor sites in 23-43 fractions (median, 33 fractions) with fraction sizes of 1.8-2.2 Gy (median, 1.8 Gy). Result(s): All irradiated tumors had disappeared macroscopically by 2-9 months after irradiation, and the initial complete response rate was 100%. However, 14 of the 36 patients developed recurrences, including four with local progression within the radiation field and 11 with lymph node or/and distant metastases outside the radiation field, during follow-up periods of 2-150 months (median, 40 months). All but one of the 11 patients with regional lymph node or distant metastases after irradiation exhibited tumor invasion into the dermis, whereas of the 15 patients without tumor invasion into the dermis, none had regional lymph node metastasis and only one had distant metastasis after irradiation. The local progression-free and diseasefree rates were 86% and 53%, respectively at 3 years and 86% and 45%, respectively at 5 years. Nine patients died at 6-73 months after irradiation; the causes of death were tumor progression in five patients, infectious pneumonia in two, renal failure in one and old age in one. The overall and cause-specific survival rates were 93% and 95%, respectively at 3 years and 61% and 80%, respectively at 5 years. Tumor invasion into the dermis was a statistically significant prognostic factor for both distant metastasis (p = 0.004) and survival (p = 0.005). No therapy-related toxicities of grade 3 or greater were observed. Conclusion(s): Radiation therapy was found to be safe and effective for patients with EMPD.

2690,"Detection of unwarranted CT radiation exposure from patient and imaging protocol meta-data using regularized regression. Background: Variability in radiation exposure from CT scans can be appropriate and driven by patient features such as body habitus. Quantitative analysis may be performed to discover instances of unwarranted radiation exposure and to reduce the probability of such occurrences in future patient visits. No universal process to perform identification of outliers is widely available, and access to expertise and resources is variable. Objective(s): The goal of this study is to develop an automated outlier detection procedure to identify all scans with an unanticipated high radiation exposure, given the characteristics of the patient and the type of the exam. Material(s) and Method(s): This Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective cohort study was conducted from June 30, 2012 - December 31, 2013 in a quaternary academic medical center. The de-identified dataset contained 28 fields for 189,959 CT exams. We applied the variable selection method Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to select important variables for predicting CT radiation dose. We then employed a regression approach that is robust to outliers, to learn from data a predictive model of CT radiation doses given important variables identified by LASSO. Patient visits whose predicted radiation dose was statistically different from the radiation dose actually received were identified as outliers. Result(s): Our methodology identified 1% of CT exams as outliers. The top-5 predictors discovered by LASSO and strongly correlated with radiation dose were Tube Current, kVp, Weight, Width of collimator, and Reference milliampere-seconds. A human expert validation of the outlier detection algorithm has yielded specificity of 0.85 [95% CI 0.78-0.92]and sensitivity of 0.91 [95% CI 0.85-0.97](PPV = 0.84, NPV = 0.92).

Conclusion(s): The study developed and tested a novel, automated method for processing CT scanner meta-data to identify CT exams where patients received an unwarranted amount of radiation. Radiation safety and protocol review committees may use this technique to uncover systemic issues and reduce future incidents.Copyright © 2019 The Authors",Excluded,0.0382482
2691,"Maternal effects of the scid mutation on radiation-induced transgenerational instability in mice. The results of a number of recent studies show that mutation rates in the offspring of irradiated parents are substantially elevated, however, the effect of parental genotype on transgenerational instability remains poorly understood. Here, we have analysed the mutation frequency at an expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) locus in the germline and bone marrow of the first-generation male offspring of control and irradiated male mice. The frequency of ESTR mutation was studied in the offspring of two reciprocal matings male symbol scid x female symbol BALB/c and male symbol BALB/c x female symbol scid, which were compared with that in BALB/c mice. In the offspring of the BALB/c x BALB/c and male symbol scid x female symbol BALB/c matings, which were conceived after paternal sperm irradiation, the frequency of ESTR mutation was significantly elevated in both tissues. In contrast, ESTR mutation frequency was only slightly elevated in the offspring of male symbol BALB/c x female symbol scid mating conceived after paternal irradiation. The results of this study suggest that the oocytes of scid females are unable to fully support the repair of double-strand breaks induced in paternal sperm which may in turn result in the elimination of cells/embryos containing high levels of DNA damage, thus partially preventing the manifestation of genomic instability.",Excluded,0.97059155
2692,"Impact of the radiosurgery prescription dose on the local control of small (2 cm or smaller) brain metastases. OBJECTIVE The impact of the stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) prescription dose (PD) on local progression and radiation necrosis for small (<= 2 cm) brain metastases was evaluated. METHODS An institutional review board-approved retrospective review was performed on 896 patients with brain metastases <= 2 cm (3034 tumors) who were treated with 1229 SRS procedures between 2000 and 2012. Local progression and/or radiation necrosis were the primary end points. Each tumor was followed from the date of radiosurgery until one of the end points was reached or the last MRI follow-up. Various criteria were used to differentiate tumor progression and radiation necrosis, including the evaluation of serial MRIs, cerebral blood volume on perfusion MR, FDG-PET scans, and, in some cases, surgical pathology. The median radiographic follow-up per lesion was 6.2 months. RESULTS The median patient age was 56 years, and 56% of the patients were female. The most common primary pathology was non-small cell lung cancer (44%), followed by breast cancer (19%), renal cell carcinoma (14%), melanoma (11%), and small cell lung cancer (5%). The median tumor volume and median largest diameter were 0.16 cm3 and 0.8 cm, respectively. In total, 1018 lesions (34%) were larger than 1 cm in maximum diameter. The PD for 2410 tumors (80%) was 24 Gy, for 408 tumors (13%) it was 19 to 23 Gy, and for 216 tumors (7%) it was 15 to 18 Gy. In total, 87 patients (10%) had local progression of 104 tumors (3%), and 148 patients (17%) had at least radiographic evidence of radiation necrosis involving 199 tumors (7%; 4% were symptomatic). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for local progression and radiation necrosis. For local progression, tumors less than 1 cm (subhazard ratio [SHR] 2.32; p < 0.001), PD of 24 Gy (SHR 1.84; p = 0.01), and additional whole-brain radiation therapy (SHR 2.53; p = 0.001) were independently associated with better outcome. For the development of radiographic radiation necrosis, independent prognostic factors included size greater than 1 cm (SHR 2.13; p < 0.001), location in the corpus callosum (SHR 5.72; p < 0.001), and uncommon pathologies (SHR 1.65; p = 0.05). Size (SHR 4.78; p < 0.001) and location (SHR 7.62; p < 0.001)-but not uncommon pathologies-were independent prognostic factors for the subgroup with symptomatic radiation necrosis. CONCLUSIONS A PD of 24 Gy results in significantly better local control of metastases measuring < 2 cm than lower doses. In addition, tumor size is an independent prognostic factor for both local progression and radiation necrosis. Some tumor pathologies and locations may also contribute to an increased risk of radiation necrosis.",Excluded,0.039833598
2693,"Survival in small cell lung cancer in India: Prognostic utility of clinical features, laboratory parameters and response to treatment. BACKGROUND: Predictors of survival and response to treatment in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are ill-defined and unclear. In an attempt to assess the impact of common presenting symptoms and laboratory values on survival, we undertook this retrospective review of patients with SCLC. To our knowledge, there is no study on survival in SCLC patients from the Indian subcontinent. DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer cases from December 2001 through December 2004, were identified and clinical data on presenting symptoms and laboratory findings from their hospital records, noted. The influence of various pretreatment factors on survival was investigated using Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox multivariate regression model. RESULT(S): 76 subjects were included (84% males, 91% smokers). 57% patients had five or more symptoms at presentation. Cumulative symptom burden was strongly associated with survival ( P =0.02). Survival was also significantly related with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ( P =0.04), disease extent (P =0.03) and symptomatic response to treatment ( P< 0.001). Patients with higher hemoglobin ( P =0.02), serum sodium ( P =0.04) and serum globulin ( P =0.02), survived significantly longer. By multivariate regression analysis, hemoglobin, KPS and brain metastases, were significant predictors of survival ( P =0.01, P =0.02, P< 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Cumulative symptom burden, KPS, disease extent and symptomatic assessment of improvement after treatment, are useful predictors of survival. This has important clinical implications, keeping in view, the infrastructure and cost involved in more objective tests like CT scan, for evaluation of disease extent and prognosis. These findings can provide a simple basis for predicting prognosis in small cell lung cancer, especially in developing countries like ours.",Excluded,0.03841094
2694,"Comparison of the effectiveness of MRI perfusion and fluorine-18 FDG PET-CT for differentiating radiation injury from viable brain tumor: a preliminary retrospective analysis with pathologic correlation in all patients. OBJECTIVES: Differentiating radiation injury from viable tumor is important for optimizing patient care. Our aim was to directly compare the effectiveness of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced (DSC) magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion in differentiating radiation effects from tumor growth in patients with increased enhancement following radiotherapy for primary or secondary brain tumors., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 12 consecutive patients with primary and secondary brain tumors over a 1-year period that demonstrated indeterminate enhancing lesions after radiotherapy and that had undergone DSC MR perfusion, FDG PET-CT, and subsequent histopathologic diagnosis. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of the lesion (SUVlesion max), SUVratio (SUVlesion max/SUVnormal brain), maximum relative cerebral blood volume, percentage of signal intensity recovery, and relative peak height were calculated from the positron emission tomography and MR perfusion studies. A prediction of tumor or radiation injury was made based on these variables while being blinded to the results of the surgical pathology., RESULTS: SUVratio had the highest predictive value (area under the curve=0.943) for tumor progression, although this was not statistically better than any MR perfusion metric (area under the curve=0.757-0.829)., CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that FDG PET-CT and DSC MR perfusion may demonstrate similar effectiveness for distinguishing tumor growth from radiation injury. Assessment of the SUVratio may increase the sensitivity and specificity of FDG PET-CT for differentiating tumor and radiation injury. Further analysis is needed to help define which modality has greater predictive capabilities. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.048018686

2696,"Potential benefits and pitfalls of respiratory-gated radiotherapy in the treatment of thoracic malignancy. Aim: Despite advances in radiotherapy delivery, the prognosis of lung cancer remains poor. Higher doses of radiation have been associated with improved outcomes but may result in higher toxicities. Respiratory gated radiotherapy (RGRT) has the potential to reduce pulmonary toxicity but there are significant limitations and pitfalls to its use. The aim of this article is to (i) describe the RGRT technique currently employed at Nepean and Westmead Hospitals; (ii) discuss the practical issues of implementing such a program; (iii) present the results of our RGRT program and (iv) review the potential uncertainties in using this technique and the methods we have used to overcome these. Method(s): A retrospective review of all patients who had a 4D-computed tomography (4D-CT) scan was undertaken. Records from treatment planning systems were used to assess the prospective gating program. Result(s): Between September 2007 and June 2011, 53 patients at Nepean and 26 patients at Westmead Hospital underwent a 4D-CT. Between April and August 2011, 26 patients at Westmead Hospital underwent a prospective 4D-CT scan as treatment verification. Two of the 26 patients (7.7%) were found to have incomplete coverage of the planning target volume. Both patients underwent respiratory re-coaching, alleviating the need for replanning. Conclusion(s): RGRT may reduce doses to organs at risk with the potential for dose escalation. However its implementation requires significant staff training, treatment time and resources. Treatment verification with image guided radiation therapy are essential for safe delivery. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Excluded,0.038516417

Objective: Bone loss in patients with inflammatory back pain (IBP) suspicious of early undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy is poorly defined. The aim of this study was to examine changes in bone mineral density (BMD) at the hip, lumbar spine and hand in patients with early IBP and to look for possible biomarkers associated with this change. Method(s): In 30 patients with early IBP, clinical data were collected and BMD assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Further imaging performed included MRI of the sacroiliac joints (SIJs) and spine at baseline and x-rays of the SIJs at baseline and after 8 years. Result(s): After 12 months no significant reduction in hip, spine and hand BMD was seen at the group level. However, hip bone loss was found to be associated with raised baseline C-reactive protein levels, baseline MRI bone marrow oedema of the SIJs and the presence of radiographic sacroiliitis after 8 years. No association was found with change in spine and hand BMD. Conclusion(s): Systemic bone loss in the hip is an early feature of the inflammatory disease process in patients with IBP in undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy and is related to disease activity. These data highlight the importance of aggressive intervention in the early stages of disease in undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy.",Excluded,0.038373005
2698,"Selective internal radiation therapy for liver malignancies. BACKGROUND: Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) is a non-ablative technique for the treatment of liver primaries and metastases, with the intention of reducing tumour bulk. This study aimed to determine optimal patient selection, and elucidate its role as a downsizing modality., METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively on patients who underwent SIRT between 2011 and 2014. The procedure was performed percutaneously by an expert radiologist. Response was analysed in two categories, based on radiological (CT/MRI according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST)) and biological (alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, chromogranin A) parameters., RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included. Liver metastases from colorectal cancer (22 patients) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (9) were the most common pathologies. Radiological response data were collected from 31 patients. A reduction in sum of diameters (SOD) was observed in patients with HCC (median -24.1 (95 per cent c.i. -43.4 to -3.8) per cent) and neuroendocrine tumours (-30.0 (-45.6 to -7.7) per cent), whereas a slight increase in SOD was seen in patients with colorectal cancer (4.9 (-10.6 to 55.3) per cent). Biological response was assessed in 17 patients, with a reduction in 12, a mixed response in two and no improvement in three. Six- and 12-month overall survival rates were 71 and 41 per cent respectively. There was no difference in overall survival between the RECIST response groups (median survival 375, 290 and 214 days for patients with a partial response, stable disease and progressive disease respectively; P = 0.130), or according to primary pathology (P = 0.063). Seven patients underwent liver resection with variable responses after SIRT., CONCLUSION: SIRT may be used to downsize tumours and may be used as a bridge to surgery in patients with tumours deemed borderline for resection.

Limb-salvage surgery has become a safe and well-established alternative to amputations for malignant tumors of the proximal humerus. The authors describe six cases with favorable restoration of the upper limb following tumor resection type IB Malawer and proximal humeral reconstruction by vascularized fibula graft (VFG) as a primary or secondary procedure. A scapulofibular arthrodesis was elected in all cases. A special custom-made plate was used in four cases. One patient required a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap for better coverage. Serial x-rays assessed the bone union. Neither flap necrosis nor sepsis phenomena were noted. Stress fracture was the only complication. This was encountered in two cases. Every patient was reviewed and assessed by the Enneking score. The average score was 21.8. The average follow-up was 5-years.

2700,"Variation in Body Shape across Species and Populations in a Radiation of Diaptomid Copepods. Inter and intra-population variation in morphological traits, such as body size and shape, provides important insights into the ecological importance of individual natural populations. The radiation of Diaptomid species (~400 species) has apparently produced little morphological differentiation other than those in secondary sexual characteristics, suggesting sexual, rather than ecological, selection has driven speciation. This evolutionary history suggests that species, and conspecific populations, would be ecologically redundant but recent work found contrasting ecosystem effects among both species and populations. This study provides the first quantification of shape variation among species, populations, and/or sexes (beyond taxonomic illustrations and body size measurements) to gain insight into the ecological differentiation of Diaptomids. Here we quantify the shape of five Diaptomid species (family Diaptomidae) from four populations each, using morphometric landmarks on the prosome, urosome, and antennae. We partition morphological variation among species, populations, and sexes, and test for phenotype-by-environment correlations to reveal possible functional consequences of shape variation. We found that intraspecific variation was 18-35% as large as interspecific variation across all measured traits. Interspecific variation in body size and relative antennae length, the two traits showing significant sexual dimorphism, were correlated with lake size and geographic location suggesting some niche differentiation between species. Observed relationships between intraspecific morphological variation and the environment suggest that divergent selection in contrasting lakes might contribute to shape differences among local populations, but confirming this requires further analyses. Our results show that although Diaptomid species differ in their reproductive traits, they also differ in other morphological traits that might indicate ecological differences among species and populations. © 2013 Hausch et al.",Excluded,0.039416242

Complex primary or revision TKA may require the use of a resection type prosthesis to address major bone loss and soft tissue deficiencies. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of salvage knee reconstructions in a larger cohort and longer follow-up than previously reported. We therefore present the results of 66 cases treated with the Finn/OSS knee system with an average follow-up of 5. years (range 2-12). Indications included 63 revision cases and three primary interventions with either massive bone loss and/or soft tissue deficiency. At final follow-up the average knee society score had significantly improved from 46 preoperatively to 73, and the function score improved from 27 to 47 points. Four cases needed to be revised: one for recurrent infection, two for aseptic loosening and one for implant breakage. Nine patients underwent minor reinterventions; including five cases with irrigation and debridement for prolonged wound drainage, two patellar realignment procedures and two extensor mechanism repairs. Two patients developed a peroneal nerve palsy. Overall implant survivorship with revision as the endpoint was 92% at 5 and 10. years.

2705,"Chernobyl birds have smaller brains. BACKGROUND: Animals living in areas contaminated by radioactive material from Chernobyl suffer from increased oxidative stress and low levels of antioxidants. Therefore, normal development of the nervous system is jeopardized as reflected by high frequencies of developmental errors, reduced brain size and impaired cognitive abilities in humans. Alternatively, associations between psychological effects and radiation have been attributed to post-traumatic stress in humans., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Here we used an extensive sample of 550 birds belonging to 48 species to test the prediction that even in the absence of post-traumatic stress, there is a negative association between relative brain size and level of background radiation. We found a negative association between brain size as reflected by external head volume and level of background radiation, independent of structural body size and body mass. The observed reduction in brain size in relation to background radiation amounted to 5% across the range of almost a factor 5,000 in radiation level. Species differed significantly in reduction in brain size with increasing background radiation, and brain size was the only morphological character that showed a negative relationship with radiation. Brain size was significantly smaller in yearlings than in older individuals., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Low dose radiation can have significant effects on normal brain development as reflected by brain size and therefore potentially cognitive ability. The fact that brain size was smaller in yearlings than in older individuals implies that there was significant directional selection on brain size with individuals with larger brains experiencing a viability advantage.",Included,0.97078246

The efficacy of multimodality image fusion road-mapping technique for endovascular therapy has been reported recently. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of endovascular therapy (EVT) with three-dimensional (3D) road mapping by fusing computed tomography (CT) and angiographical volumetric data for aorto-iliac chronic total occlusion (CTO). We retrospectively analyzed 36 patients with aorto-iliac CTO from June 2017 to November 2019 and classified them into two groups: EVT using a CT fused 3D roadmap (CTf3D-RM; 3D group, n = 14) and standard EVT (standard group, n = 22). Primary endpoint was wiring time and secondary endpoints were procedural success rate, number of guidewires, procedure time, radiation dose, contrast medium dose, and complications. Wiring time was significantly shorter in the 3D group than the standard group (3D, 15.6 +/- 10.23 min vs. standard, 44.6 +/- 35.3 min; p = 0.0052). Both groups had high procedural success rates (3D, 100% vs. standard, 100%) and low complication rates (3D, 0.0% vs. standard, 9.1%; p = 0.51). There were significantly fewer guidewires in the 3D group than the standard group (3D, 2.78 +/- 1.31 vs. standard, 4.36 +/- 2.01; p = 0.0138). The 3D group trended towards shorter procedural time (3D, 78.8 +/- 32.5 min vs. standard, 107.5 +/- 52.5 min; p = 0.076), lower radiation dose (3D, 28.6 +/- 18.9 Gycm2 vs. standard, 48.9 +/- 49.2 Gycm2; p = 0.15), and lower contrast medium dose (3D, 102.2 +/- 30.6 vs. standard, 127.5 +/- 51.3; p = 0.11) than the standard group.

PURPOSE: To investigate the long-term effect of surface light scattering and glistenings of various intraocular lenses (IOLs) on visual function and optical aberrations after cataract surgery., DESIGN: Case-control study., METHODS: Thirty-five eyes that underwent implantation of a hydrophobic acrylic, silicone, or polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) IOL more than 10 years ago were recruited. The scattering light intensity of the surface and internal matrix of the optic was measured using Scheimpflug photography. Visual acuity (VA) was measured using VA charts, and contrast VA and that with glare (glare VA) were examined using a contrast sensitivity tester. Ocular higher-order aberrations (HOAs) were measured using a Hartmann-Shack aberrometer., RESULTS: Mean scattering light intensity of the surface and internal matrix of the optic was significantly higher in the acrylic group than in the silicone and PMMA groups (P < .0001). Mean uncorrected VA, photopic and mesopic contrast VA and glare VA, and HOAs did not differ significantly among groups, although mean corrected VA in the acrylic group was significantly better than that in the other groups (P = .0023). Scattering light intensity of the surface and internal matrix did not correlate with VA, contrast VA, or glare VA, and did not correlate with ocular and internal optic HOAs in the acrylic group., CONCLUSIONS: At more than 10 years postoperatively, visual function, including contrast sensitivity, and ocular HOAs were comparable among eyes that received acrylic, silicone, and PMMA IOLs. Surface scattering and glistenings with the acrylic IOLs were not significantly correlated with visual function and optical aberrations. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

2708,"Elevated mortality among birds in Chernobyl as judged from skewed age and sex ratios. BACKGROUND: Radiation has negative effects on survival of animals including humans, although the generality of this claim is poorly documented under low-dose field conditions. Because females may suffer disproportionately from the effects of radiation on survival due to differences in sex roles during reproduction, radiation-induced mortality may result in male-skewed adult sex ratios., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: We estimated the effects of low-dose radiation on adult survival rates in birds by determining age ratios of adults captured in mist nets during the breeding season in relation to background radiation levels around Chernobyl and in nearby uncontaminated control areas. Age ratios were skewed towards yearlings, especially in the most contaminated areas, implying that adult survival rates were reduced in contaminated areas, and that populations in such areas could only be maintained through immigration from nearby uncontaminated areas. Differential mortality in females resulted in a strongly male-skewed sex ratio in the most contaminated areas. In addition, males sang disproportionately commonly in the most contaminated areas where the sex ratio was male skewed presumably because males had difficulty finding and acquiring mates when females were rare. The results were not caused by permanent emigration by females from the most contaminated areas because none of the recaptured birds had changed breeding site, and the proportion of individuals with morphological abnormalities did not differ significantly between the sexes for areas with normal and higher levels of contamination., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the adult survival rate of female birds is particularly susceptible to the effects of low-dose radiation, resulting in male skewed sex ratios at high levels of radiation. Such skewed age ratios towards yearlings in contaminated areas are consistent with the hypothesis that an area exceeding 30,000 km(2) in Chernobyl's surroundings constitutes an ecological trap that causes dramatic excess mortality.",Included,0.9707399

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of carbon-ion radiotherapy in patients with major salivary gland carcinoma. Sixty-nine patients treated with carbon-ion radiotherapy at four Japanese institutions were analyzed. Thirty-three patients (48%) had adenoid cystic carcinomas, 10 (14%) had mucoepidermoid carcinomas, and 26 (38%) had other disease types. Three patients (4%) had T1 disease, 8 (12%) had T2, 25 (36%) had T3, and 33 (48%) had T4. The median radiation dose was 64 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) in 16 fractions.

2710,"Keratocyte reflectivity and corneal haze. Corneal transparency is a remarkable characteristic that is essential for vision. Biophysical models of corneal transparency have entirely focused on the stromal extracellular matrix and disruption of the regular array of collagen fibres as the main reason for corneal haziness. Therefore, disorder of corneal transparency has traditionally been explained by a combination of three main factors: (1) abnormal water content (i.e. swelling or edema); (2) abnormal collagen fibre diameter, spacing, and orientation (i.e. scar tissue or fibrosis); and (3) abnormal accumulation of macromolecules (proteins, glycosaminoglycans, lipids, etc.) as in many corneal dystrophies. Here, clinical and experimental data are provided to support the concept that corneal keratocytes, which are normally invisible and transmit light, may show intense light scattering in injured corneas. Thus, the existence of a fourth group of corneal transparency disorders is proposed that predominantly are associated with abnormal cellular-based reflections from multiple layers of stromal keratocytes. In this group of patients, the light scattering structures (keratocyte nuclei, cell-body, and cell-processes) cannot be discriminated using standard slit-lamp biomicroscopy but requires a confocal microscopic examination. Despite their importance, almost nothing is known about the physical basis for the invisibility and haziness of the keratocytes. A more comprehensive model to understand corneal transparency is needed and should include the interaction of visible light with the physical structure of the keratocyte and its subcellular constituents.",Excluded,0.03868645
2711,"A retrospective multicenter study of carbon-ion radiotherapy for external auditory canal and middle ear carcinomas. Background: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study to assess the clinical outcomes of carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for head and neck malignancies (Japan Carbon-Ion Radiation Oncology Study Group [J-CROS] study: 1402 HN). We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CIRT in patients with external auditory canal (EAC) and middle ear (ME) carcinomas. Method(s): Thirty-one patients treated with CIRT at four Japanese institutions were analyzed. Fourteen patients (45.2%) had squamous cell carcinomas, 13 (41.9%) had adenoid cystic carcinomas, and four (12.9%) had other types. Nineteen (61.3%), six (19.4%), three (9.7%), and three (9.7%) patients had T4, T3, T2, and T1 disease, respectively. All patients had N0M0 status. The median radiation dose was 64 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) in 16 fractions. The median gross tumor volume was 33.3 mL. Result(s): The median follow-up period was 18.4 months (range, 5.1-85.6). The 1- and 3-year local control and overall survival rates were 75.0% and 55.0% and 79.3% and 58.7%, respectively. Regarding grade 3 or higher toxicities, three patients (9.7%) had grade 3 dermatitis, one (3.2%) had grade 3 mucositis, and two (6.5%) had grade 3 central nervous necrosis (ie, radiation-induced brain necrosis).

2712,"Ultra-low-dose thoracic CT with model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) in cystic fibrosis patients undergoing treatment with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators (CFTR). AIM: To assess the utility of a volumetric low-dose computed tomography (CT) thorax (LDCTT) protocol at a dose equivalent to a posteroanterior (PA) and lateral chest radiograph for surveillance of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was undertaken of 19 adult patients with CF that proceeded to LDCTT at 12 and 24 months following initiation of ivacaftor. A previously validated seven-section, low-dose axial CT protocol was used for the 12-month study. A volumetric LDCTT protocol was developed for the 24-month study and reconstructed with hybrid iterative reconstruction (LD-ASIR) and pure iterative reconstruction (model-based IR [LD-MBIR]). Radiation dose was recorded for each scan. Image quality was assessed quantitatively and qualitatively, and disease severity was assessed using a modified Bhalla score. Statistical analysis was performed and p-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULT(S): Volumetric LD-MBIR studies were acquired at a lower radiation dose than the seven-section studies (0.08 +/- 0.01 versus 0.10 +/- 0.02 mSv; p=0.02). LD-MBIR and seven-section ASIR images had significantly lower levels of image noise compared with LD-ASIR images (p<0.0001). Diagnostic acceptability scores and depiction of bronchovascular structures were found to be acceptable for axial and coronal LD-MBIR images. LD-MBIR images were superior to LD-ASIR images for all qualitative parameters assessed (p<0.0001). No significant change was observed in mean Bhalla score between 1-year and 2-year studies (p=0.84). CONCLUSION(S): The use of a volumetric LDCTT protocol (reconstructed with pure IR) enabled acquisition of diagnostic quality CT images, which were considered extremely useful for surveillance of CF patients, at a dose equivalent to a PA and lateral chest radiograph.Copyright © 2021 The Royal College of Radiologists",Excluded,0.038500898
2713,"Prognostic analysis of radiation pneumonitis: carbon-ion radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced lung cancer. BACKGROUND: Carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) is a promising treatment for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, especially for patients with inoperable lung cancer. Although the incidence of CIRT-induced radiation pneumonitis (RP) >= grade 2 ranges from 2.5 to 9.9%, the association between CIRT-induced RP and dosimetric parameters is not clear. Herein, we identified prognostic factors associated with symptomatic RP after CIRT for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer., METHODS: Clinical results of 65 patients treated with CIRT between 2000 and 2015 at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical stage II B disease (TNM classification) was the most common stage among the patients (45%). The median radiation dose was 72 Gy (68-76) relative biological effectiveness (RBE) in 16 fractions. In cases involving metastatic lymph nodes, prophylactic irradiation of mediastinal lymph nodes was performed at a median dose of 49.5 Gy (RBE). The median follow-up was 22 months., RESULTS: Grade 2 and grade 3 RP occurred in 6 and 3 patients (9 and 5%), respectively. No patients developed grade 4 or 5 RP. Using univariate analysis, vital capacity as a percentage of predicted (%VC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), mean lung dose (MLD), volume of lung receiving >=5 Gy (RBE) (V5), V10, V20 and V30 were determined to be the significant predictive factors for >= grade 2 RP. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed the cutoff values for %VC, FEV1, MLD, V5, V10, V20 and V30 for >= grade 2 RP, which were 86.9%, 1.16 L, 12.5 Gy (RBE), 28.8, 29.9, 20.1 and 15.0%, respectively. In addition, the multivariate analysis revealed that %VC <86.9% (odds ratio = 13.7; p = 0.0041) and V30 >= 15% (odds ratio = 6.1; p = 0.0221) were significant risk factors., CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the risk factors for >= grade 2 RP after carbon-ion radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced lung cancer.",Excluded,0.046401873
2714,"Dose escalation of gemcitabine concomitant with radiation and cisplatin for nonsmall cell lung cancer: A phase 1-2 study. BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to evaluate the maximum tolerable dose of weekly gemcitabine administered simultaneously with radiation and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHOD(S): Patients with stage IIIA/B NSCLC received concurrently 63 grays radiation and 20 mg/m2 cisplatin Day 1 to 3 in Weeks 1 and 5, plus weekly gemcitabine at escalating doses (150-700 mg/m2) on Fridays after radiation to avoid radiosensitization. The authors assessed dose-limiting toxicities according to Common Toxicity Criteria. The primary endpoint was maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine. Tumor resectability, survival, and disease-free survival (DFS) were also determined. RESULT(S): Forty-two patients were accrued, of whom 95% received radiation and 66% cisplatin as above. Weekly doses of gemcitabine were escalated to 700 mg/m 2. Grade 3 dysphagia and 1 case of fatal, probably treatment-related pulmonary deterioration established the MTD of gemcitabine at 550 mg/m2 weekly. Twenty-five patients underwent surgery, and histopathological complete regression was documented in 26% of these patients. Overall, median actuarial survival and DFS were 23.8 and 12.4 months, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Gemcitabine at doses up to 550 mg/m2 weekly can be given simultaneously with radiation and cisplatin to patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Radical resection thereafter is feasible. The impact of this aggressive therapy should be evaluated further. © 2010 American Cancer Society.",Excluded,0.03843989

The results of a survey of radiation workers suggest that they are worried about the effects of radiation exposure on health, and approximately 30% of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) workers have anxiety. This questionnaire survey reveals that the higher the frequency of radiation education, the higher the knowledge of radiation the workers will have, and that the higher the level of knowledge, the lower the anxiety. To reduce anxiety, it is important to increase knowledge about radiation through radiation education. However, even those workers who had radiation education several times still had anxiety. According to the Ordinance on the Prevention of Ionizing Radiation Hazards, the time spent on education about the effects of radiation on the human body is only about 30 minutes. This education is not enough to reduce anxiety. FDNPP workers needed more effective education to increase their knowledge and to reduce their anxiety.",Excluded,0.970492
2717,"Radiation Exposure Optimisation During AF Ablations Utilising the Cryoballoon Ablation System. BACKGROUND: Radiation risk minimisation during cardiac catheterisation, particularly atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation procedures, requires a multifaceted approach involving both technique and technology., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate radiation dose associated with cryoballoon compared to conventional radiofrequency (RF) AF ablation procedures., METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing AF ablation were collected in a single-centre registry. Radiation and procedural data for index AF ablation procedures using four ablation techniques were compared: RF ablation with and without the anti-scatter grid (RF Grid and RF Gridless), and cryoballoon ablation utilising first and second-generation Medtronic Arctic Front Cryoballoons (Cryo; Arctic Front, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), with and without 3D imaging during fluoroscopy (Cryo 3D and Cryo)., RESULTS: We studied 418 patients; 30 RF Grid, 68 RF No Grid, 12 Cryo 3D and 308 Cryo. The dose area product (DAP; Gycm2), adjusted for patient standardised weight of 80kg, was significantly higher for the Cryo 3D (21.91) and RF Grid (7.31) than the Cryo (2.13) and RF Gridless (3.31) groups; as a result, Cryo 3D was discontinued and RF Grid was only used when clinically required. Comparing the remaining groups, DAP for Cryo was significantly lower than RF Gridless (p<0.001) mainly attributable to a difference in fluoroscopy use (13.2 vs. 17.3 mins; p<0.001). Cryo procedure time was also significantly shorter (80 mins vs. 133 mins; p<0.01)., CONCLUSION: Cryoballoon AF ablations can be performed efficiently using Gridless fluoroscopy techniques achieving significant reduction in radiation exposure and procedure time while maintaining safety and efficacy. In this observational study, cryoballoon AF ablations compare favourably to conventional RF ablations in terms of these parameters.

2718,"Technological Advances in Arrhythmia Management Applied to Adults With Congenital Heart Disease. Arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity in adults with congenital heart disease. Numerous challenges to managing arrhythmias include vascular access issues, intracardiac shunts, unconventional locations of the conduction system, and anatomical complexities. Technological advances are improving our ability to diagnose and treat arrhythmias. Implantable loop recorders and various technologies developed for consumers to record electrocardiographic tracings using smartphone applications, watches, and dedicated portable devices are expanding our armamentarium of diagnostic tools. Remote magnetic-guided catheter ablation is enhancing access to otherwise difficult to reach arrhythmia substrates. Cryoablation allows perinodal arrhythmias to be safely treated in patients with displaced or difficult to predict locations of the atrioventricular conduction system. Interventions that minimize radiation exposure to near 0 levels are gaining interest and pulmonary vein isolation procedures to treat atrial fibrillation are increasingly performed. Cardiac implantable electronic devices compatible with magnetic resonance imaging have become the norm. Subcutaneous defibrillators and leadless pacemakers are providing effective solutions to patients in whom transvenous leads are contraindicated or not desired. His-bundle pacing is emerging as a viable option to provide more physiological pacing. Progressive advances in multicomponent communicating leadless devices carry the promise of providing leadless dual chamber pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy in the near future. The safety of transvenous lead extraction procedures is likely to improve with advances such as the low-pressure balloon to manage superior vena cava lacerations. Awareness of these developments and referral to sites with dedicated expertise could contribute to further improving outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease.

Study design: Randomized controlled trials of conventional and laser-navigated technology techniques for balloon kyphoplasty were carried out. Objective(s): To evaluate the effectiveness of a new laser navigation system in reducing the radiation dose in balloon kyphoplasty procedures. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty-seven randomized controlled trials involving a total of 75 lumbar vertebrae were treated. Thirty-four vertebrae were treated by regular fluoroscopic imaging alone, and the other 41 vertebrae were treated using the new laser navigation system. For each procedure the fluoroscopy dosage was documented using a Hitachi-Aloka Medical external dosimeter. The operation time was recorded. Result(s): The amount of radiation exposure in the control group was 870.59 +/- 134.27 muSv. A significant reduction of the fluoroscopy usage in the navigated group was detected (503.5 +/- 70.0 muSv (p <.0001)). In the control group, the average procedure time was 51.47 +/- 8.30 minutes.

Introduction: The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of fever in adult ED patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) and to determine which, if any, physical exam, radiograph and laboratory test findings were associated with fever. Method(s): We conducted a prospective, observational study at an urban county trauma center of adults who presented to the ED for evaluation of suspected SSTI. ED providers measured area of erythema and induration using a tape measure, and completed data sheets indicating comorbid conditions and the presence or absence of physical exam findings. Fever was defined as any recorded temperature > 38degreeC during the first six hours of ED evaluation. Result(s): Of the 734 patients enrolled, 96 (13.1%) had fever. Physical and laboratory exam findings associated with the presence of a fever in multivariable logistic regression were the area of erythema, particularly the largest quartile of area of erythema, 144-5,000 cm2, (odd ratio [OR] = 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.6-5.2]) and leukocytosis (OR = 4.4, 95% CI [2.7-7.0]). Bullae, necrosis, streaks, adenopathy, and bone involvement on imaging were not associated with fever. Conclusion(s): Fever is uncommon in patients presenting to the ED for evaluation of suspected SSTI.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the clinical features and prognostic factors of bone metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following liver transplantation (LT)., METHODS: All adult patients undergoing LT from 2001 to 2010 were reviewed. Patients with HCC bone metastases after LT received external beam radiotherapy(EBRT) during this period. Demographic variables, laboratory values, and tumor characteristics were determined before LT and EBRT. Total radiation dose ranged from 8 to 60 Gy(median dose 40.0 Gy)., RESULTS: The trunk was the most common site of bone metastases with finding of expansile soft-tissue masses in 23.3% of patients. Overall pain relief from EBRT occurred in 96.7% (29/30). No consistent dose-response relationship was found for palliation of with doses between 30 and 56 Gy (P = 0.670). The median survivals from the time of bone metastases was 8.6 months. On univariate and multivariate analyses, better survival was significantly associated with a better Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and well-controlled intrahepatic tumor, but not with lower alpha-fetoprotein levels. The median time from LT to bone metastases was 7.1 months. Patients exceeding the Shanghai criteria presented with bone metastases earlier than those within the Fudan criteria.

AIB1 (amplified in breast cancer 1) is frequently overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but the significance of AIB1 expression in chemoradiotherapy (CRT) sensitivity and its effect on prognosis are still unclear. In this study, the expression of AIB1 was examined by immunohistochemistry in 98 biopsy specimens of primary ESCC patients treated with definitive CRT. AIB1 overexpression was found in 63/98 (64.3%) of the ESCCs. There was a significant association between AIB1 overexpression and distant lymph node metastases (P = 0.011), but not regional lymph node metastases. In the M0 subgroup, overexpression of AIB1 was observed more frequently in stage T4 than in stage T2-3 (66.7%vs 38.5%, P = 0.031). In addition, AIB1 expression was the only factor that showed a significant correlation with CRT response, in which overexpression of AIB1 was observed more frequently in the CRT resistant group than in the CRT effective group (86.5%vs 50.8%, P < 0.001). Univariate analysis revealed that AIB1 overexpression was associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) (P < 0.001) and poor disease-specific survival (DSS) (P <0.001). Furthermore, AIB1 expression could stratify patient survival in stages T2-3, T4, N1, and M0 (P < 0.05), as well as in the CRT effective group (P < 0.05), and AIB1 overexpression and CRT resistance were evaluated as significant independent prognostic factors for both PFS and DSS in multivariate analysis.

Objectives: To observe the differences of dosimetric parameters and late toxicities in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), which may provide the selective basis about radiation technology in clinical practices. Methods and materials: Dosimetric parameters and late toxicities were collected and retrospectively analyzed from 627 NPC patients (stage as I-IVA/IVB) between January 2010 and December 2015. Result(s): The median D2 of all targets and D50 of PGTVnd (regional lymph nodes) were lower in VAMT than those in IMRT, while the median D95 and D98 of PGTVnx (primary lesions) were higher in VMAT than those in IMRT (p < 0.05). Superior sparing of the organs at risk were observed in VMAT. The maximum dose of the brainstem, spinal cord, temporal lobes, temporomandibular joint, optic chiasm, and lens were lower in VMAT than those in IMRT, where the median dose reduction ranged from 0.56 to 3.56 Gy (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the median parotid glands V30 in VMAT was reduced by approximately 2% compared to that in IMRT (p = 0.027). Regarding the late toxicities, ototoxicity, trismus, and temporal lobe injury were reduced by VMAT (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the late toxicities were correlative with the radiation dose of the corresponding OARs (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): For NPC treatment plans, the VMAT might provide not only more favorable dose distributions of targets but also better sparing of normal tissue than observed in IMRT. Furthermore, VMAT possibly provides less treatment-related late toxicities such as ototoxicity, trismus, and temporal lobe injury.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded,0.03870499
2726,"Carotid Artery Stenting With Proximal Embolic Protection via a Transradial or Transbrachial Approach: Pushing the Boundaries of the Technique While Maintaining Safety and Efficacy. PURPOSE: To compare the feasibility and safety of proximal cerebral protection to a distal filter during carotid artery stenting (CAS) via a transbrachial (TB) or transradial (TR) approach., METHODS: Among 856 patients who underwent CAS between January 2007 and July 2015, 214 (25%) patients (mean age 72+/-8 years; 154 men) had the procedure via a TR (n=154) or TB (n=60) approach with either Mo.MA proximal protection (n=61) or distal filter protection (n=153). The Mo.MA group (mean age 73+/-7 years; 54 men) had significantly more men and more severe stenosis than the filter group (mean age 71+/-8 years; 100 men). Stent type and CAS technique were left to operator discretion. Heparin and a dedicated closure device or bivalirudin and manual compression were used in TR and TB accesses, respectively. Technical and procedure success, crossover to femoral artery, 30-day major adverse cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events (MACCE; death, all strokes, and myocardial infarction), vascular complications, and radiation exposure were compared between groups., RESULTS: Crossover to a femoral approach was required in 1/61 (1.6%) Mo.MA patient vs 11/153 (7.1%) filter patients mainly due to technical difficulty in engaging the target vessel. Five Mo.MA patients developed acute intolerance to proximal occlusion; 4 were successfully shifted to filter protection. A TR patient was shifted to filter because the Mo.MA system was too short. CAS was technically successful in the remaining 55 (90%) Mo.MA patients and 142 (93%) filter patients. The MACCE rate was 0% in the Mo.MA patients and 2.8% in the filter group (p=0.18). Radiation exposure was similar between groups. Major vascular complications occurred in 1/61 (1.6%) and in 3/153 (1.96%) patients in the Mo.MA and filter groups (p=0.18), respectively, and were confined to the TB approach in the early part of the learning curve. Chronic radial artery occlusion was detected by Doppler ultrasound in 2/30 (6.6%) Mo.MA patients and in 4/124 (3.2%) filter patients by clinical assessment (p=0.25) at 8.1+/-7.5-month follow-up., CONCLUSION: CAS with proximal protection via a TR or TB approach is a feasible, safe, and effective technique with a low rate of vascular complications.

2727,"3D deep learning angiography (3D-DLA) from C-arm Conebeam CT. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that has demonstrated unprecedented performance in many medical imaging applications. Our purpose was to develop a deep learning angiography method to generate 3D cerebral angiograms from a single contrast-enhanced C-arm conebeam CT acquisition in order to reduce image artifacts and radiation dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A set of 105 3D rotational angiography examinations were randomly selected from an internal data base. All were acquired using a clinical system in conjunction with a standard injection protocol. More than 150 million labeled voxels from 35 subjects were used for training. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to classify each image voxel into 3 tissue types (vasculature, bone, and soft tissue). The trained deep learning angiography model was then applied for tissue classification into a validation cohort of 8 subjects and a final testing cohort of the remaining 62 subjects. The final vasculature tissue class was used to generate the 3D deep learning angiography images. To quantify the generalization error of the trained model, we calculated the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and Dice similarity coefficients for vasculature classification in relevant anatomy. The 3D deep learning angiography and clinical 3D rotational angiography images were subjected to a qualitative assessment for the presence of intersweep motion artifacts. RESULT(S): Vasculature classification accuracy and 95% CI in the testing dataset were 98.7% (98.3%-99.1%). No residual signal from osseous structures was observed for any 3D deep learning angiography testing cases except for small regions in the otic capsule and nasal cavity compared with 37% (23/62) of the 3D rotational angiographies. CONCLUSION(S): Deep learning angiography accurately recreated the vascular anatomy of the 3D rotational angiography reconstructions without a mask. Deep learning angiography reduced misregistration artifacts induced by intersweep motion, and it reduced radiation exposure required to obtain clinically useful 3D rotational angiography.Copyright © 2018 American Society of Neuroradiology.

2728,"Magnetic resonance imaging at 7.0 T for evaluation of early lesions of epiphyseal plate and epiphyseal end in a rat model of Kashin-Beck disease. Background: Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) is a disabling osteoarticular disease involving growth and joint cartilage. Early diagnosis can effectively prevent the progress of the disease. However, the early diagnosis of it is still very difficult. Our aim was to study the knee joint lesions of a rat KBD model using ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and compare it with X-ray imaging to analyze the possible MRI manifestations of KBD, and to further explore ways to determine the pathological damage of KBD in the early stage. Method(s): A total of 96 Wistar rats were selected and randomly divided into 4 groups: normal diet (Group A), KBD-affected diet (Group B), normal diet+T-2 toxin (Group C), and KBD-affected diet+T-2 toxin (Group D). T-2 toxin was administered at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day. In the 4th week, 8th week, and 12th week, eight rats randomly selected in each group were sacrificed by cervical dislocation after undergoing X-ray and 7.0 T MRI imaging, and then knee joints were harvested, sliced, and subjected to hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Result(s): Characteristic image changes including of continuity interruption and early closure and fusion of epiphyseal plates were observed on T1WI in rat model of KBD. The total necrosis rates in the H&E stain of group A to group D were 4.35, 52.38, 33.3, and 73.68%, respectively. The positive rate of image change under 7.0 T MRI was 0.833 VS. that under X-ray was 0.33 (P = 0.001). Conclusion(s): MRI at 7.0 T is highly sensitive to the early pathological changes of the epiphysis, epiphyseal plate, and metaphyseal end, which can improve imaging positive rate of KBD and decrease the rate of missed diagnosis. This imaging modality can be used for research on early joint lesions and for early diagnosis of KBD.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).",Excluded,0.2704193
2729,"Emergency readmission following elective endoscopy: Audit of 29 868 day-case procedures performed at four teaching hospitals in northwest england. Introduction Despite emergency readmission being a NHS quality indicator and unplanned admission after elective endoscopy a GRS auditable outcome; there is a lack of audit standards and difficulties in attaining these data due to limitations in hospital IT systems. Commercial analytical reporting tools that use NHS administrative data can generate local reports from HES and may serve as a starting point for clinical audit. Aim To determine the prevalence, demographics, aetiology and outcomes of emergency readmissions following elective endoscopy. Methods From 1.4.08 to 31.3.09 emergency admissions within 6 days of a day-case upper or lower GI endoscopy (ERCP excluded) were identified from analyses of NHS administrative data at RLUH, AUH, SRH, and SMUH. Using a standard proforma, each readmission was audited using case notes, endoscopy database, and the hospital informatics systems. Two senior doctors determined the validity of the admission subdividing them into; unrelated, possible and definite with the latter two categories defining an endoscopy readmission. Results Of the 29 868 daycases, 235 admissions were identified, of which 147 were endoscopy readmissions. The following data all relates to endoscopy readmissions. Demographics Male: Female ratio=1:1; Mean age (SD): 65.1 years (17).Readmission rate overall was 0.49%(0.56% for upper and 0.42% for lower GI procedures) with highest rates for therapeutic uppers (1.75%) > therapeutic lowers (0.56%) > diagnostic upper (0.47%) > diagnostic lower (0.38%). Aetiology The most common reasons for admission were vascular events (26.5%) > Symptoms such as pain (17%), GI haemorrhage (17%), suspected/confirmed perforation (17% (confirmed 6.1%))> respiratory (10.2%) causes >bowel obstruction (4.8%): Investigations 71% required simple blood tests and/or x-rays and 26%, cross-sectional imaging. Treatment 84.4% required only observation, 4.8%; surgery, 2.7%; repeat endoscopy, and 7.5% IV antibiotics. Outcomes 24.5% were short-stays discharges from either AED, or medical/Surgical assessment units. Mean LOS was 8.2 (13) days and 30-day mortality was 6.8%. Conclusion Commercial analytical reporting tools combined with local interpretation and multicentre collaboration was essential for determining useful information regarding endoscopy readmissions. Readmission rates predictably varied with the procedure type (0.38-1.75%) with therapeutic procedures having the highest. While most patients required simple observation/supportive care, LOS was considerable and mortality rate among readmitted cases was significant.",Excluded,0.038203478
2730,"Less is More: The Impact of Multidisciplinary Thyroid Conference on the Treatment of Well-Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma. BACKGROUND: In 2006, a multidisciplinary thyroid conference (MDTC) was implemented to better plan management of thyroid cancer patients at our institution. This study assessed the clinical impact of a MDTC on radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment patterns., METHODS: A prospective database (2003-2014) collected patient and tumor characteristics, RAI doses, and tumor recurrences. Patients treated with total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma >=1 cm were stratified based on American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk classification. RAI regimens were compared before initiation of MDTC (2003-2005, n = 88), after establishment of MDTC (2007-2009, n = 95), and after the release of 2009 ATA guidelines (2011-2014, n = 181). RAI doses were defined as low (<=75 mCi), intermediate (76-150 mCi), and high (>150 mCi)., RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the number of patients who received high-dose RAI after implementation of MDTC compared to before initiation of MDTC in the intermediate and high-risk patient groups (p = 0.04 and p < 0.01) without an associated increase in tumor recurrence (11 vs. 7%, p = 0.74). On multivariable analysis, presentation of a patient at MDTC was a negative predictor for receiving high-dose RAI (p = 0.002). As might be expected, there was also a significant decrease in use of RAI after the 2009 ATA guidelines were issued compared to after implementation of MDTC (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: In conjunction with implementation of a thyroid malignancy multidisciplinary conference, we observed significantly decreased postoperative dosing of RAI without increased tumor recurrence. The 2009 ATA guidelines were associated with a further decrease in RAI administration.

2731,"Optimizing number of cycles of induction chemotherapy for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Retrospective survival analysis. Background: Induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy is one of the standards of care for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but the optimal number of induction cycles is unclear. Here we compared survival data from patients treated with 2 to 4 cycles. Method(s): Patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma at West China Hospital of Sichuan University between January 2009 and December 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Result(s): Six hundred and seventy three patients met eligibility criteria. After a median follow-up of 53 months (interquartile range, 38-74), there was no difference between 2 and 3 cycles in overall survival (88.14% vs 91.24%). But four cycles were associated with worse overall survival (79.12%) and higher incidence of treatment-related toxicities. Multivariate analysis showed that the number of induction cycles and lymph node classification were prognostic factors. Conclusion(s): Two and three cycles of induction chemotherapy are associated with similar survival, while four cycles reduce survival and increase treatment-related toxicity in endemic regions.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded,0.038266666
2732,"Precise determination of the erythema response of human skin to ultraviolet radiation and quantification of effects of protectors. BACKGROUND: We describe highly reproducible methods for quantifying the erythema response of precisely selected areas (spots) of human skin to graded doses of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). These methods have permitted evaluation of the efficacy of protectors, such as sulforaphane from crucifers, that defend cells through induction of cytoprotective (phase 2) genes., METHODS: Spots on the back were precisely located by opaque, adhesive, vinyl templates provided with 16 circular, 2.0 cm diameter occludable windows. Doses (100-800 mJ/cm(2)) of narrow-band (311 nm) UVR were administered, and the erythema index (a(*)) was measured with a chromometer on treated and control areas, before and after radiation., RESULTS: Daily variations in basal a(*) values of each spot were much smaller than the differences of a(*) values among spots of one individual, or those of corresponding spots among different individuals. The increments in erythema responses to UVR (Delta a(*)) were similar despite large variations of basal a(*) of spots. The most appropriate measure of UVR-evoked erythema is therefore the Delta a(*) value for each spot, which is an independent observational entity. Delta a(*) was proportional to UVR dose, and independent of spot location. To evaluate effectiveness of protectors against UVR damage we paired horizontally adjacent spots for treatment and controls. Vertical or random spot pairing did not provide significantly higher consistency. Protective efficacy against UVR erythema is appropriately expressed as percent reduction in Delta a(*) values upon treatment with inducers., CONCLUSIONS: The protection of skin against UVR damage can be quantified precisely from changes in erythema index (Delta a(*)) obtained with a chromometer.",Excluded,0.03990968

2734,"Effects of psychotherapy on DNA strand break accumulation originating from traumatic stress. Background: Previous research reveals an association between traumatic stress and an increased risk for numerous diseases, including cancer. At the molecular level, stress may increase carcinogenesis via increased DNA damage and impaired DNA repair mechanisms. We assessed DNA breakage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and measured the cellular capacity to repair single-strand breaks after exposure to ionizing X-radiation. We also investigated the effect of psychotherapy on both DNA breakage and DNA repair. Method(s): In a first study we investigated DNA breakage and repair in 34 individuals with PTSD and 31 controls. Controls were subdivided into 11 trauma-exposed subjects and 20 individuals without trauma exposure. In a second study, we analysed the effect of psychotherapy (Narrative Exposure Therapy) on DNA breakage and repair. Thirty-eight individuals with PTSD were randomly assigned to either a treatment or a waitlist control condition. Follow-up was performed 4 months and 1 year after therapy. Result(s): In study 1 we found higher levels of basal DNA breakage in individuals with PTSD and trauma-exposed subjects than in controls, indicating that traumatic stress is associated with DNA breakage. However, single-strand break repair was unimpaired in individuals with PTSD. In study 2, we found that psychotherapy reversed not only PTSD symptoms, but also DNA strand break accumulation. Conclusion(s): Our results show-for the first time in vivo-an association between traumatic stress and DNA breakage; they also demonstrate changes at the molecular level, i.e., the integrity of DNA, after psychotherapeutic interventions. © 2014 S.

2735,"320-Row Multidetector CT Angiography in the Detection of Critical Cerebrovascular Anomalies. Background: The acquisition of a new 320-row multidetector computed tomography angiography (CTA) scanner at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital has provided higher quality imaging with less radiation exposure and shorter time of acquisition. However, its reliability has not been fully proven in critical vascular lesions when it comes to replacing a more invasive examination such as cerebral angiography. We wished to validate the accuracy of this equipment to investigate four common indications for patients to undergo conventional digital subtraction angiography: subarachnoid hemorrhage, vasospasm, unusual intracerebral hemorrhage, and unruptured aneurysm. Method(s): Radiological reports and relevant imaging from 82 consecutive subjects who underwent a 320-row multidetector CTA followed by cerebral angiography from February 2010 to February 2014 were retrospectively analysed. A total of 102 cerebrovascular anomalies were found. Reports from both imaging modalities were compared to determine the diagnostic accuracy of CTA. Result(s): The overall sensitivity and specificity of 320-row multidetector CTA for detecting cerebrovascular abnormalities were, respectively, 97.60% and 63.20%. Similar results were obtained for all four categories of clinical indications. Conclusion(s): Results obtained from CTA were consistent with those obtained on digital subtraction angiography regardless of the vascular pathology.

2736,"Feasibility and potential utility of multicomponent exhaled breath analysis for predicting development of radiation pneumonitis after stereotactic ablative radiotherapy. INTRODUCTION: In this prospective pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility and potential utility of measuring multiple exhaled gases as biomarkers of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients receiving stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for lung tumors., METHODS: Breath analysis was performed for 26 patients receiving SABR for lung tumors. Concentrations of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), carbon monoxide (eCO), nitrous oxide (eN2O), and carbon dioxide (eCO2) were measured before and immediately after each fraction using real-time, infrared laser spectroscopy. RP development (CTCAE grade >=2) was correlated with baseline gas concentrations, acute changes in gas concentrations after each SABR fraction, and dosimetric parameters., RESULTS: Exhaled breath analysis was successfully completed in 77% of patients. Five of 20 evaluable patients developed RP at a mean of 5.4 months after SABR. Acute changes in eNO and eCO concentrations, defined as percent changes between each pre-fraction and post-fraction measurement, were significantly smaller in RP versus non-RP cases (p = 0.022 and 0.015, respectively). In an exploratory analysis, a combined predictor of baseline eNO greater than 24 parts per billion and acute decrease in eCO less than 5.5% strongly correlated with RP incidence (p =0.0099). Neither eN2O nor eCO2 concentrations were significantly associated with RP development. Although generally higher in patients destined to develop RP, dosimetric parameters were not significantly associated with RP development., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of SABR patients in this pilot study were able to complete exhaled breath analysis. Baseline concentrations and acute changes in concentrations of exhaled breath components were associated with RP development after SABR. If our findings are validated, exhaled breath analysis may become a useful approach for noninvasive identification of patients at highest risk for developing RP after SABR.",Excluded,0.15413828
2737,"Validation of prognostic scoring systems for myelodysplastic syndromes in the Swedish MDS-register. Background: Since the survival in patients diagnosed with MDS varies from months to decades, prognostic models are important tools for estimating prognosis and making therapy-related decisions. Several scoring systems for risk stratification have been developed including the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), the Revised IPSS (IPSS-R) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification-based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS). The nationwide Swedish MDS-register was started in 2009 and includes newly diagnosed patients with Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and disorders with combined features of myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN). All hospitals in Sweden diagnosing these patients report to the MDS-register, including university hospitals, county and local hospitals. The completeness against the compulsory Swedish Cancer Register was 95% for the period under study (2009-2013). Aim(s): The aim of this study was to validate and compare IPSS, IPSS-R and WPSS in a nationwide population-based setting. Furthermore, we present data on incidence, clinical characteristics at diagnosis and clinical outcomes such as overall survival and AML-transformation. Method(s): All patients aged 16 years or older diagnosed with MDS 2009-2013 and reported to the MDS-register were included (n=1334). Patients with MDS/MPN were excluded (n=291). Data included date of diagnosis, age, gender, WHO-diagnosis, laboratory parameters, transfusions-dependency, diagnostic procedures including information on bone marrow morphology and cytogenetics and information on previous treatment with chemotherapy or irradiation. By means of record linkage, information was obtained from the Swedish Cause of Death Register and the Swedish AML-register up to December 31, 2014 to calculate overall survival (OS) and transformation to AML. Overall and AML-free survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic scores were calculated for IPSS, IPSS-R and WPSS, respectively. The prognostic methods were evaluated using Harrell's concordance (C) index. The indices were internally validated by bootstrapping with 1000 samples. Result(s): The crude yearly incidence of MDS was 3.5 per 100.000 persons. Median age at diagnosis was 76 years and 58% of the patients were male. At time of diagnosis, 49% of patients were dependent on red blood cell transfusions. The median OS for the whole population was 2.7 years and time to 25% AML-transformation was 3.8 years. For 848 (64%) patients data were complete, enabling risk score assessment for all three systems. The major part of missing data was attributed to that karyotyping was not performed, mainly in the older population. Compared to previous register-based studies we found that a larger proportion of patients had higher risk disease. Risk category in the different scoring systems, OS and time to 25% AML-transformation are presented in Table 1. Comparisons between the scoring systems show that all three had good prognostic power. However, IPSS-R and WPSS had significantly better prognostic properties compared to IPSS. (Table Presented) Summary/Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first nationwide population based validation of IPSS, IPSS-R and WPSS. While our findings confirm the prognostic power of all three systems, IPSS-R and WPSS appear to be slightly more powerful tools for prognostication than IPSS.",Excluded,0.038298704

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the correlation between ""target-lesion"" SYNTAX score (tSS) and radiation dose (RD) and examine the predictive value of tSS and other variables on RD from percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)., BACKGROUND: The complexity of PCI influences procedural RD. The novel tSS was utilized to quantify targeted-PCI complexity., METHODS: We studied 420 consecutive patients who had PCI in our hospital. Two investigators independently measured tSS using the SYNTAX scoring algorithm. Patients were divided into three BMI (kg/m(2) ) subgroups: <25 (normal), 25-30 (overweight), and >30 (obese); and tSS tertiles: <5.5 (simple), 5.5-9 (moderate), and >9 (complex)., RESULTS: Obese patients were significantly younger and likely to have diabetes mellitus (DM). tSS positively correlated with RD for both genders, with median RD significantly higher in males (P < 0.0001). tSS correlated with RD in all three BMI subgroups (all P < 0.0001). Multivariate linear regression showed RD can be predicted by the formula: RD = -898 + 18 tSS + 49 BMI + 142 DM + 207 male., CONCLUSIONS: We report that tSS is a quantitative index of ""target-lesion"" PCI complexity, which is easy to measure with good reproducibility. tSS significantly and independently correlates with RD, although the strength of the association is less than for other predictors of RD (gender, diabetes, and BMI). tSS may be used to determine the RD from PCI and enhance patient risk-stratification when formulating a PCI strategy.

BACKGROUND: Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (GdMRI) is routinely used in the evaluation and management of suspected retrocochlear pathology such as vestibular schwannoma. However, its value in the evaluation and diagnosis of cochlear pathology associated with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has been less clear., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of case histories and imaging studies of patients with SNHL and cochlear enhancement on GdMRI diagnosed between 1998 and 2000., RESULTS: Five patients with SNHL who required gadolinium administration to establish the diagnosis of endocochlear disease were identified. Diagnosed lesions included an intralabyrinthine schwannoma, intracochlear hemorrhage, radiation-induced ischemic change, autoimmune labyrinthitis, and meningogenic labyrinthitis. In these illustrative cases, the GdMRI demonstrated intrinsic high signal or contrast enhancement within the cochlea and labyrinth in the absence of a retrocochlear mass. In one patient with meningogenic labyrinthitis, cochlear enhancement on MRI led to prompt cochlear implantation before the potential development of cochlear ossification., CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that GdMRI plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of cochlear pathology associated with sensorineural hearing loss and may directly impact patient management.",Excluded,0.038199518
2742,"Preoperative isolated limb infusion of doxorubicin and external irradiation for limb-threatening soft tissue sarcomas. Background: At present, limb-sparing surgery is the most appropriate and acceptable treatment option for soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. To increase the number of limb-sparing resections in the treatment of locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities, preoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy are often used. Isolated limb perfusion of cytostatic agents is an effective alternative option but technically complex. Isolated limb infusion, essentially a low-flow isolated limb perfusion without oxygenation via a percutaneous catheter, had been developed as a simple alternative. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to achieve limb-sparing surgery in patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities that would otherwise have required an amputation or a functionally mutilating surgery by performing preoperative isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin and external beam irradiation to obtain local control and make limb-sparing surgery feasible. Method(s): A total of 40 patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities were evaluated between 2002 and 2005. Tumors were located in the lower limb in 28 patients (70%) and in the upper limb in 12 patients (30%). All of these patients were felt to be unresectable and were referred because amputation was considered the only available treatment option. They underwent preoperative isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin (0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg for the upper and lower limbs, respectively). Preoperative external beam radiotherapy started within 3-7 days after isolated limb infusion was administered. The total dose was 35 Gy in ten fractions. After 3-7 weeks, surgery was performed aiming at limb preservation. Result(s): Tumor response was seen in 85% of patients, rendering these large sarcomas resectable in most cases. The mean values of pretreatment tumor volume and post-treatment volume were 2797 cm3 and 1781 cm3, respectively, with a significant p value of 0.0001. Histologic response was seen in 80% of patients. At a median followup of 15 months (range = 5-35), limb salvage was achieved in 82.5%. Procedure-related complications were limited and easily managed. Conclusion(s): Isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin is a simple and safe method of regional chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Observations from previous intracoronary radiation therapy trials noted a considerable discrepancy between the prescribed radiation dose and the dose actually delivered. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of actual delivered dose on vascular changes and to test the appropriateness of the current dose prescription., METHODS AND RESULTS: Serial volumetric intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) analysis was performed in 30 in-stent restenosis cases treated with a 40-mm (90)Sr/Y source train. The fixed dose was prescribed at 2 mm from the centerline of the source train (18.4 Gy at 2 mm for reference diameter or =3.36 mm). Only stent segments with full radiation coverage and device injury were enrolled and divided into 2-mm-long subsegments (n=202). D(S90)EEM (the minimum dose absorbed by 90% of the external elastic membrane surface) was calculated as the delivered dose corresponding to each segment, assuming that the radiation catheter occupied the same position in the vessel as the IVUS catheter. Mean D(S90)EEM of 23.5+/-5.82 Gy (range 12.3 to 41.7 Gy) was delivered to these subsegments. Overall, intimal hyperplasia volume remained constant from postintervention to follow-up (2.23+/-1.10 to 2.32+/-1.09 mm3/m; P=NS). Regression analysis revealed there was no correlation between delivered dose intensity and changes in intimal hyperplasia volume. No particular dose-dependent complications were appreciated in this delivered dose range., CONCLUSIONS: The current dose-prescription protocol of (90)Sr/Y radiation to native in-stent restenosis lesions may provide substantial inhibition of neointimal reproliferation regardless of the actual delivered dose intensity.",Excluded,0.9701146

Introduction: To retrospectively analyze the outcome of patients with esophageal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Method(s): A total of 41 patients received neoadjuvant intent chemoradiation for esophageal cancer. Most patients had a locally advanced disease (T3/4: 82%, N+: 83%, M0: 100%) and squamous cell carcinoma (83%). All patients received concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin/5-fluorouracil or mitomycin/5-fluorouracil. Median radiation dose was 50.4Gy in the 25 patients who proceeded to surgery and 57.4Gy in 16 patients who did not undergo surgery. FDG-PET/CT was used for treatment planning in 24 patients. A second FDG-PET/CT was available for response evaluation in 18 patients. Result(s): Median follow-up was 16 months in all patients and 30 months in survivors. Radiotherapy was completed without interruptions >3 days in 90% of patients, and chemotherapy was carried out to >80% in 85% of patients. The 2-year locoregional control rate was 60%, distant control rate 54% and overall survival rate 50%. Hematological toxicity grade 3/4 was observed in 34%/10% of patients and non-hematological toxicity grade 3/4 in 46%/2% of patients. Perioperative 30-day mortality was 4%. Subgroup analyses revealed that surgery significantly improved locoregional control (74% vs. 39%, p= 0.034), but not the 2-year survival rate (54% vs. 43%, p= 0.246). In contrast, response based on FDG-PET/CT prior and after chemoradiation significantly predicted improved overall survival (2-year overall survival 61% vs. 40%, p= 0.048). Conclusion(s): Outcomes of our cohort were comparable to other series using similar treatments. Surgery significantly improved locoregional control but not survival.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of dose reduction on the performance of computer-aided lung nodule detection systems (CAD) of two manufacturers by comparing respective CAD results on ultra-low-dose computed tomography (ULD-CT) and standard dose CT (SD-CT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) data sets of 26 patients (13 male and 13 female, patients 31 - 74 years old) were retrospectively selected for CAD analysis. Indication for CT examination was staging of a known primary malignancy or suspected pulmonary malignancy. CT images were consecutively acquired at 5 mAs (ULD-CT) and 75 mAs (SD-CT) with 120 kV tube voltage (1 mm slice thickness). The standard of reference was determined by three experienced readers in consensus. CAD reading algorithms (pre-commercial CAD system, Philips, Netherlands: CAD-1; LungCARE, Siemens, Germany: CAD-2) were applied to the CT data sets., RESULTS: Consensus reading identified 253 nodules on SD-CT and ULD-CT. Nodules ranged in diameter between 2 and 41 mm (mean diameter 4.8 mm). Detection rates were recorded with 72 % and 62 % (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2) for SD-CT and with 73 % and 56 % for ULD-CT. Median false positive rates per patient were calculated with 6 and 5 (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2) for SD-CT and with 8 and 3 for ULD-CT. After separate statistical analysis of nodules with diameters of 5 mm and greater, the detection rates increased to 83 % and 61 % for SD-CT and to 89 % and 67 % for ULD-CT (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2).

2749,"Facilitation of somatic calcium channels can evoke prolonged tail currents in rat hypoglossal motoneurons. Voltage-dependent persistent inward currents (PICs) make an important contribution to the input-output properties of alpha motoneurons. PICs are thought to be mediated by membrane channels located primarily on the dendrites as evidenced by prolonged tail currents following the termination of a voltage step and by a clockwise hysteresis in the whole cell inward currents recorded in response to depolarizing then repolarizing voltage ramp commands. We report here, however, that voltage-clamp currents with these same features can be generated in isolated somatic membrane patches from rat hypoglossal motoneurons. Long-lasting (200-800 ms) tail currents after 1-s voltage-clamp pulses were observed in nucleated patches from 16 of 23 cells. Further, these somatic PICs display ""facilitation"" in response to conditioning depolarization as previously observed in whole cell recordings from intact neurons. Pharmacological tests suggest that the PICs were primarily mediated by Cav1 channels. Our results show that many of the features of persistent calcium currents recorded from intact motoneurons do not necessarily reflect a remote dendritic origin but can also be ascribed to the intrinsic properties of their Cav1 channels.",Excluded,0.03875957
2750,"Hypoxia-inducible factor pathway inhibition resolves tumor hypoxia and improves local tumor control after single-dose irradiation. Purpose To study the effects of BAY-84-7296, a novel orally bioavailable inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activity, on hypoxia, microenvironment, and radiation response of tumors. Methods and Materials UT-SCC-5 and UT-SCC-14 human squamous cell carcinomas were transplanted subcutaneously in nude mice. When tumors reached 4 mm in diameter BAY-84-7296 (Bayer Pharma AG) or carrier was daily administered to the animals. At 7 mm tumors were either excised for Western blot and immunohistologic investigations or were irradiated with single doses. After irradiation animals were randomized to receive BAY-84-7296 maintenance or carrier. Local tumor control was evaluated 150 days after irradiation, and the dose to control 50% of tumors (TCD50) was calculated. Results BAY-84-7296 decreased nuclear HIF-1alpha expression. Daily administration of inhibitor for approximately 2 weeks resulted in a marked decrease of pimonidazole hypoxic fraction in UT-SCC-5 (0.5% vs 21%, P<.0001) and in UT-SCC-14 (0.3% vs 19%, P<.0001). This decrease was accompanied by a significant increase in fraction of perfused vessels in UT-SCC-14 but not in UT-SCC-5. Bromodeoxyuridine and Ki67 labeling indices were significantly reduced only in UT-SCC-5. No significant changes were observed in vascular area or necrosis. BAY-84-7296 before single-dose irradiation significantly decreased TCD50, with an enhancement ratio of 1.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.72) in UT-SCC-5 and of 1.55 (95% CI 1.26-1.94) in UT-SCC-14. BAY-84-7296 maintenance after irradiation did not further decrease TCD50. Conclusions BAY-84-7296 resulted in a marked decrease in tumor hypoxia and substantially reduced radioresistance of tumor cells with the capacity to cause a local recurrence after irradiation. The data suggest that reduction of cellular hypoxia tolerance by BAY-84-7296 may represent the primary biological mechanism underlying the observed enhancement of radiation response. Whether this mechanism contributes to the improved outcome of fractionated chemoradiation therapy warrants further investigation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.21686456

2752,"Differential recovery of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus after ionizing radiation. Radiation therapy is a widely used treatment for malignant central nervous system tumors. Mature neurons are terminally differentiated, whereas stem and progenitor cells have a prominent proliferative capacity and are therefore highly vulnerable to irradiation. Our aim was to investigate how cranial radiation in young rats would affect stem/progenitor cells in the two niches of adult neurogenesis, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Nine weeks after irradiation we found that in irradiated animals, hippocampal neurogenesis was reduced to 5% of control levels. Similarly, the numbers of actively proliferating cells and radial glia-like stem cells (nestin+/glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]+) in the dentate gyrus were reduced to 10% and 15% of control levels, respectively. In the irradiated olfactory bulb, neurogenesis was reduced to 40% of control levels, and the number of actively proliferating cells in the SVZ was reduced to 53% of control levels. However, the number of nestin+/GFAP+ cells in the SVZ was unchanged compared with controls. To evaluate the immediate response to the radiation injury, we quantified the amount of proliferation in the SVZ and dentate gyrus 1 day after irradiation. We found an equal reduction in proliferating cells both in dentate gyrus and SVZ. In summary, we show an initial response to radiation injury that is similar in both brain stem cell niches. However, the long-term effects on stem cells and neurogenesis in these two areas differ significantly: the dentate gyrus is severely affected long-term, whereas the SVZ appears to recover with time.",Included,0.97072935

2755,"When is rotational angiography superior to conventional single-plane angiography for planning coronary angioplasty?. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the value of rotational coronary angiography (RoCA) in the context of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) planning., BACKGROUND: As a diagnostic tool, RoCA is associated with decreased patient irradiation and contrast use compared with conventional coronary angiography (CA) and provides superior appreciation of three-dimensional anatomy. However, its value in PCI remains unknown., METHODS: We studied stable coronary artery disease assessment and PCI planning by interventional cardiologists. Patients underwent either RoCA or conventional CA pre-PCI for planning. These were compared with the referral CA (all conventional) in terms of quantitative lesion assessment and operator confidence. An independent panel reanalyzed all parameters., RESULTS: Six operators performed 127 procedures (60 RoCA, 60 conventional CA, and 7 crossed-over) and assessed 212 lesions. RoCA was associated with a reduction in the number of lesions judged to involve a bifurcation (23 vs. 30 lesions, P < 0.05) and a reduction in the assessment of vessel caliber (2.8 vs. 3.0 mm, P < 0.05). RoCA improved confidence assessing lesion length (P = 0.01), percentage stenosis (P = 0.02), tortuosity (P < 0.04), and proximity to a bifurcation (P = 0.03), particularly in left coronary artery cases. X-ray dose, contrast agent volume, and procedure duration were not significantly different., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional CA, RoCA augments quantitative lesion assessment, enhances confidence in the assessment of coronary artery disease and the precise details of the proposed procedure, but does not affect X-ray dose, contrast agent volume, or procedure duration.

To assess putative magnetization transfer effects on the proton resonances of cerebral metabolites in human brain, we performed quantitative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (2.0 T, STEAM, TR/TE/TM = 6000/40/10 ms, LCModel data evaluation) of white matter (7.68 mL, 10 healthy young subjects) in the absence and presence of fast repetitive off-resonance irradiation (2.1 kHz from the water resonance) using a train of 100 Gaussian-shaped RF pulses (12.8 ms duration, 120 Hz nominal bandwidth, 40 ms repetition period, 1080 degrees nominal flip angle). A comparison of pertinent metabolite concentrations revealed a magnetization transfer attenuation factor of the methyl and methylene resonances of creatine and phosphocreatine of 0.87 +/- 0.05 (p < 0.01). No attenuation was observed for the resonances of N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate, glutamate and glutamine, choline-containing compounds, and myo-inositol. The finding for total creatine is in excellent agreement with data reported for rat brain. The results are consistent with the hypothesis of a chemical exchange of mobile creatine or phosphocreatine molecules with a small immobilized or 'bound' pool.

2757,"Factors associated with acute and late dysphagia in the DAHANCA 6 & 7 randomized trial with accelerated radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is a common and debilitating side effect in head and neck radiotherapy (RT). Prognostic factors are numerous and their interrelationship not well understood. The aim of this study was to establish a multivariate prognostic model for acute and late dysphagia after RT, based on information from a prospective trial., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The DAHANCA 6&7 randomized study included 1476 patients with head and neck cancer eligible for primary RT alone. Patients were randomized between 5 and 6 weekly fractions of conventional RT, and received 62-70 Gy in 31-35 fractions. Patients were scored for dysphagia weekly during treatment and at regular intervals until five years after treatment. Dysphagia scores were available from 1461 patients., RESULTS: Acute dysphagia according to DAHANCA grades 1, 2, 3 and 4 occurred in 83%, 71%, 43% and 23%, respectively. Severe dysphagia occurred in 47% and 38% of patients receiving accelerated or conventional radiotherapy, respectively (p = 0.001). At one, two, three, four and five years the prevalence of chronic dysphagia above grade 0, was 46%, 32%, 29%, 24%, 23%, respectively with no difference between 5 and 6 fractions. In multivariate analysis, the following parameters were independent factors for severe acute dysphagia: T3-T4 tumors, N-positive disease, non-glottic cancer, age> median, baseline dysphagia > 1 and accelerated radiotherapy. The following factors were prognostic factors for late dysphagia: non-glottic cancer, T3-T4, N-positive disease and baseline dysphagia > 1. The data confirmed previously published predictive models, as it was possible to separate patients in groups with low, medium and high risk of dysphagia, respectively, based on pre-treatment risk scores., CONCLUSION: Prognostic models were established to characterize patients at risk of developing acute or late dysphagia in the DAHANCA 6&7 trial.

2759,"Minimal erythema dose after multiple UV exposures depends on pre-exposure skin pigmentation. BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Phototherapy consists of multiple ultraviolet (UV) exposures. Most previous studies have focused on erythema following a single UV exposure in fair-skinned persons. Although it is well known that phototherapy lowers the daily UV-threshold dose for erythema in clinical practice, this is insufficiently documented under controlled experimental conditions. The purpose of this study was to quantify the change in the daily threshold for a dose specific erythema grade after 1-4 consecutive daily UV exposures., METHODS: Forty-nine healthy volunteers (skin type II-V) with varying pigmentation quantified by skin reflectance. Two UV sources were used: a narrowband UVB (Philips TL01) and a Solar Simulator (Solar Light Co.). Just perceptible erythema after 24 h was chosen as the minimal erythema dose (+); besides + and ++ were assessed., RESULTS: We found a positive and significant exponential relationship between skin pigmentation and UV dose to elicit a specific erythema grade on the back after 1-4 UV exposures. After repetitive UV exposures the UV dose had to be lowered more in dark-skinned persons compared with fair-skinned persons to elicit a certain erythema grade. This applied to both UV sources and all erythema grades., CONCLUSION: In the dark-skinned persons the daily UV dose after the 4 days UV exposure should be lowered by 40-50% to avoid burns compared with the single UV exposure. For the most fair-skinned persons essentially no reduction in the daily UV dose was needed. Our results indicate that the pre-exposure pigmentation level can guide the UV dosage in phototherapy.",Excluded,0.038149167

Aim: The presentation of our results using the Dornier lithotripter (Doli) S electromagnetic shockwave emitter (EMSE) 220 F-XP for the strategic management of staghorn renal calculi. Method(s): Sixteen patients with renal staghorn stones of more than 35 mm in maximum length on plain X-rays were treated by shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) monotherapy with the Doli S EMSE 220 F-XP. Double-J ureteral stent was inserted to all prior to the first SWL treatment. Shock wave counts varied from 2,500 to 3,600 with a shock release frequency of 70-80 pulses per minute. The number of sessions varied from 2 to 6. The interval between the SWL sessions was around 1 month. Fragmentation rate of 20-25% of the stone load per session was considered a valid criterion for progressing to further SWL sessions. Result(s): Nine patients became stone free at the end of SWL sessions and two patients had renal stone fragments smaller than 4 mm, which were eliminated 6 months later. Two patients developed streinstrasse that was managed with ureteroscopy. Auxiliary SWL was also performed on three patients with residual ureteral calculi. The mean follow up period was 12 months. The remaining five patients underwent open surgery for incomplete stone fragmentation. No major complications developed during the follow up period. The predominant composition of stones available for analysis was struvite.

Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm with a poor prognosis. Curative management of these tumors has been difficult secondary to delayed diagnosis and advanced disease at presentation. Treatment modalities including surgery and fractionated radiotherapy have had limited success in controlling these tumors. Median survival time is often measured in months. A review of all patients treated between 1952 and 1999 identified 32 patients with anaplastic or poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Patients were divided into two groups: those treated between 1952 to 1980 (9 patients, group 1) and those treated between 1981 and 1999 (23 patients, group 2). Most group 1 patients received once-daily radiotherapy and most group 2 patients received twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy. A variety of radiotherapy techniques were used. Chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, vincristine, or cisplatin. Eleven patients presented with lymph node metastasis and two patients had distant metastases at diagnosis. The most common clinical presentation was a neck mass in 17 patients. In group 1, one patient was treated with surgery only, four with surgery and radiotherapy and four with radiotherapy alone. In group 2, 1 patient was treated with surgery only; 3 with surgery and radiotherapy; 10 with radiotherapy and chemotherapy; 5 with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy; and 5 with radiotherapy alone.

Aim: Evaluation of narrow band ultraviolet B (NB UVB 311 nm) in the treatment of vitiligo by two independent studies. The first study compared NB UVB with a well-established therapeutic modality, psoralen ultraviolet A (PUVA), and the second study was conducted to find out whether psoralen might add to its efficacy. Method(s): In the first study, 15 patients were exposed on the left half of their body to UVB 311 nm and then exposed on their right half to UVA after ingestion of psoralen. In the second study, 20 patients were exposed to UVB 311 nm on the left side of the body, followed by ingestion of psoralen and exposure to NB UVB 311 nm 90 min later to the right side of the body. In both studies, while exposing one side, the other was protected by an UV-proof gown. Thus two right-left comparative studies were carried out simultaneously, namely: UVB 311 nm vs. PUVA and UVB 311 nm vs. PUVB 311 nm. Result(s): In the first study, comparison of PUVA and NB UVB 311 nm showed no difference either in the degree of response or in the incidence of complications. In the second study, comparison of PUVB and UVB showed equal clinical improvement on both sides. The cumulative dose needed to achieve the same response on the PUVB side was lower than that on the UVB side, but the difference was not statistically significant. The incidence of phototoxic reactions was significantly higher on the PUVB treated body half. Conclusion(s): NB UVB 311 nm has similar repigmentary effects as PUVA.

Abdominal imaging at 3.0 T has shown to be challenging because of a number of artifacts and effects related to the physics at higher field strength. For bowel imaging at 3.0 T, artifacts due to magnetic field inhomogeneities, standing waves, increased susceptibility, and greater chemical shift effects are of particular concern because they are likely to affect the assessment of relevant structures and counterbalance the benefits of higher signal-to-noise ratio. Regarding small- and large-bowel magnetic resonance imaging, the benefits of higher field strengths translate mainly in better contrast-to-noise ratio of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted gradient echo and T2-weighted imaging, whereas steady-state free precession sequences seem to suffer from serious degradation of image quality.

2769,"Dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy. PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a prime candidate for image-guided radiotherapy. This study was designed to assess the feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy by quantifying the dosimetric effects induced by the magnetic field in patients' plans and identifying the associated clinical consequences., METHODS: Monte Carlo dose calculation was performed for nine patients of various treatment sites (lung, liver, prostate, brain, skull-base, and spine) and tissue homogeneities, in the presence of 0.5 and 1.5 T magnetic fields. Dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters such as D95, D5, and V20 as well as equivalent uniform dose were compared for the target and organs at risk, before and after applying the magnetic field. The authors further assessed whether the plans affected by clinically relevant dose distortions could be corrected independent of the planning system., RESULTS: By comparing the resulting dose distributions and analyzing the respective DVHs, it was determined that despite the observed lateral beam deflection, for magnetic fields of up to 0.5 T, neither was the target coverage jeopardized nor was the dose to the nearby organs increased in all cases except for prostate. However, for a 1.5 T magnetic field, the dose distortions were more pronounced and of clinical concern in all cases except for spine. In such circumstances, the target was severely underdosed, as indicated by a decrease in D95 of up to 41% of the prescribed dose compared to the nominal situation (no magnetic field). Sites such as liver and spine were less affected due to higher tissue homogeneity, typically smaller beam range, and the choice of beam directions. Simulations revealed that small modifications to certain plan parameters such as beam isocenter (up to 19 mm) and gantry angle (up to 10degree) are sufficient to compensate for the magnetic field-induced dose disturbances. The authors' observations indicate that the degree of required corrections strongly depends on the beam range and direction relative to the magnetic field. This method was also applicable to more heterogeneous scenarios such as skull-base tumors., CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy and delivering a clinically acceptable dose to patients with various tumor locations within magnetic fields of up to 1.5 T. This work could serve as a guide and encouragement for further efforts toward clinical implementation of hybrid MRI-proton gantry systems.",Excluded,0.038670518

2773,"Reducing computed tomography utilization in the evaluation of renal colic in the emergency department. Study Objective: Evaluation of suspected kidney stones make up more than 1 million visits to emergency departments (ED) annually. Renal colic is frequently evaluated with the use of computed tomography (CT), the use of which has greatly increased in recent years. CT for suspected kidney stone has not been shown to improve patient outcomes but is associated with increased exposure to radiation, increased cost and increased ED length of stay. Method(s): In this project, a two-hospital community-based emergency medicine group and the local Regional Collaborative Care Organization (RCCO) began a joint project with the intent to improve the delivery of care to all patients. The goal of our project was to reduce CT imaging in the evaluation of renal colic in the ED to reduce costs, reduce exposure to radiation, and make CT imaging more available for emergent conditions. An educational program was used to support providers in the ED in reduction of total use of CT in the evaluation of patients. This included ultrasound education along with understanding of the cost, radiation exposure and use model for evaluation of suspected renal colic. A monitoring and feedback system was implemented. A care pathway was developed to help with the decisionmaking process and to facilitate a more standardized approach to care. Result(s): All patients seen and evaluated at the two sites were included in the data set. A baseline in utilization was established for all patients from 7/1/14 to 12/31/14. Education and pathways were introduced in the first half of 2015. Data was collected in the same manner for 7/1/15 to 12/31/15. The data was reviewed for individual providers as well as a department as a whole. Data is reported as a number of studies performed per 1000 patients seen for all complaints. The baseline data demonstrated utilization at site #1 at 21.60 and site #2 at 16.45 per 1000 patients. The post implementation data for site #1 is 13.01 and site #2 is 10.40 per 1000 patients. This represents areductionof 40%atsite #1 and 37% at site #2. The combinedresult of the two sites was a reduction from 17.17 to 10.94 per 1000 patients seen or a reduction of 38%. The overall reduction in the six months of data collection was from 1208 total scans to 753 or a change of 455 scans for essentially the same volume of total patients seen in the ED (68,196 base versus 68,804 after). There was a 32% decrease in variability in practice looking at the individuals from baseline to post intervention. RCCO noted a decrease in their financial burden of their patients. In review of the RCCO supported patients comparing the full 2014 year to 2015 there was a reduction in exams for their patient population from 3493 to 2111 or a difference of 1382 (40% decrease). The cost savings to RCCO was $978,602 for that same period. Conclusion(s): The patients received more consistent goal-directed evaluation and care. Patients had a decrease in radiation. The financial burden was decreased. The facility was able to utilize the CT equipment for more timely care of critical patients.

Background: Thyroid cancer patients treated with radioiodine are potential source of radiation exposure for other individuals. Thus, we evaluated the radiation dose received by family members of thyroid cancer patients treated with 131I after hospital discharge. Material(s) and Method(s): Seventy-six family members of 56 thyroid cancer patients were included in the study. Thyroid cancer patients were given 3.7GBq of 131I and remained in a radiation protection ward for 3 days. Radiation protection recommendations were given to patients and relatives. Life conditions were recorded and radiation doses were monitored using a personal dosimeter. Results and Discussion: At discharge, the mean residual activity was 188MBq. The mean radiation dose delivered to relatives during the 7 days after discharge was low (51.5muSv) and was similar with either recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) (59muSv) or withdrawal (50muSv) (p=0.37). Conclusion(s): With our current practice, radiation doses to relatives are low and well below international recommendations. © 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded,0.038778964

In this positron emission tomography (PET) study in humans we determined the pharmacokinetics and radiation dose of oxygen-15 labelled butanol, a recently introduced tracer for regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). This report includes a description of the automated preparation of 15O-butanol which allows repetitive activation studies, each 15 min apart. Dynamic rCBF studies were extended by prolonged measurements up to 15 min after injection over different organs such as brain, liver, kidneys and bladder. All measurements were done with a whole-body PET camera PC4096-15WB. Based on the pharmacokinetic data in 13 subjects the radiation doses to single organs were calculated according to MIRD pamphlet No. 11 and the effective dose defined by ICRP 60 as an indicator of radiation dose to the total body. The liver received the highest radiation dose of about 2.2 mGy per 1500 MBq of injected 15O-butanol, which is the typical amount of administered tracer in one rCBF measurement. The dose to the kidneys was 1.6 mGy, to the stomach 0.8 mGy, and to the brain 0.16 mGy. The effective dose was 0.54 mGy, which was similar to that of H2(15)O, but lower than the effective dose from C15O2 in amounts typically applied in human rCBF studies.",Excluded,0.038725518

2779,"Adaptive and innovative Radiation Treatment FOR improving Cancer treatment outcomE (ARTFORCE); a randomized controlled phase II trial for individualized treatment of head and neck cancer. BACKGROUND: Failure of locoregional control is the main cause of recurrence in advanced head and neck cancer. This multi-center trial aims to improve outcome in two ways. Firstly, by redistribution of the radiation dose to the metabolically most FDG-PET avid part of the tumour. Hereby, a biologically more effective dose distribution might be achieved while simultaneously sparing normal tissues. Secondly, by improving patient selection. Both cisplatin and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) antibodies like Cetuximab in combination with Radiotherapy (RT) are effective in enhancing tumour response. However, it is unknown which patients will benefit from either agent in combination with irradiation. We will analyze the predictive value of biological markers and (89)Zr-Cetuximab uptake for treatment outcome of chemoradiation with Cetuximab or cisplatin to improve patient selection., METHODS: ARTFORCE is a randomized phase II trial for 268 patients with a factorial 2 by 2 design: cisplatin versus Cetuximab and standard RT versus redistributed RT. Cisplatin is dosed weekly 40 mg/m(2) for 6 weeks. Cetuximab is dosed 250 mg/m(2) weekly (loading dose 400 mg/m(2)) for 6 weeks. The standard RT regimen consists of elective RT up to 54.25 Gy with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to 70 Gy in 35 fractions in 6 weeks. Redistributed adaptive RT consists of elective RT up to 54.25 Gy with a SIB between 64-80 Gy in 35 fractions in 6 weeks with redistributed dose to the gross tumour volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV), and adaptation of treatment for anatomical changes in the third week of treatment.Patients with locally advanced, biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, oral cavity or hypopharynx are eligible.Primary endpoints are: locoregional recurrence free survival at 2 years, correlation of the median (89)Zr-cetuximab uptake and biological markers with treatment specific outcome, and toxicity. Secondary endpoints are quality of life, swallowing function preservation, progression free and overall survival., DISCUSSION: The objective of the ARTFORCE Head and Neck trial is to determine the predictive value of biological markers and (89)Zr-Cetuximab uptake, as it is unknown how to select patients for the appropriate concurrent agent. Also we will determine if adaptive RT and dose redistribution improve locoregional control without increasing toxicity.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01504815.",Excluded,0.038623497
2780,"Real world outcomes of combination and timing of immunotherapy with radiotherapy for melanoma with brain metastases. Introduction: Immunotherapy (IT) and radiotherapy (RT) have improved overall survival in patients with melanoma with brain metastasis (MBM). We examined the real-world survival impact of IT and RT combination and timing strategies. Material(s) and Method(s): From the facility-based National Cancer Database (NCDB) data set, 3008 cases of MBM were identified between 2011 and 2015. Six treatment cohorts were identified: stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) + IT, SRS alone, whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) + IT, WBRT alone, IT alone, and none. Concurrent therapy was defined as IT given within 28 days before or after RT; nonconcurrent defined as IT administered within 28-90 days of RT. The co-primary outcomes were propensity score-adjusted overall survival by treatment regimen and overall survival by RT and IT timing. Result(s): Median overall survival (mOS) was performed for each treatment category; SRS +IT 15.77 m; (95%CI 12.13-21.29), SRS alone (9.33 m; 95%CI: 8.0-11.3), IT alone (7.29 m; 95%CI: 5.35-12.91), WBRT +IT (4.89 m; 95%CI: 3.65-5.92), No RT or IT (3.29 m; 95%CI: 2.96-3.75), and WBRT alone (3.12 m; 95%CI 2.79-3.52). By propensity score matching, mOS for SRS +IT (15.5 m; 95%CI: 11.5-20.2) was greater than SRS alone (10.1 m; 95%CI: 8.4-11.8) (p = 0.010), and median survival for WBRT +IT (4.6 m; 95%CI: 3.4-5.6) was greater than WBRT alone (2.9 m; 95%CI: 2.5-3.5) (p < 0.001). In the SRS +IT group, 24-month landmark survival was 47% (95%CI; 42-52) for concurrent versus 37% (95%CI; 30-44) for nonconcurrent (p = 0.40). Conclusion(s): Those who received IT in addition to WBRT and SRS experienced longer survival compared to RT modalities alone, while those receiving concurrent SRS and IT trended toward improved survival versus nonconcurrent therapy.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

2781,"How are patients influenced when counseled for minimally invasive lumbar spine surgeries? A stepwise model assessing pivotal information for decision-making. Background Context Although minimally invasive surgery (MIS)-transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) has many evidence-based short-term benefits over open TLIF, both procedures have similar long-term outcomes. Patients' preference for MIS over open TLIF may be confounded by a lack of understanding of what each approach entails. Purpose The study aimed to identify the various factors influencing patients' choice between MIS and open TLIF. Study Design/Setting This is a cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary health-care institution. Patient Sample Patients, for whom TLIF procedures were indicated, were recruited over a 3-month period from specialist outpatient clinics. Outcome Measure The outcome measure was patients' choice of surgical approach (MIS or open). Methods All patients were subjected to a stepwise interviewing process and were asked to select between open and MIS approaches at each step. Further subgroup analysis stratifying subjects based on stages of decision-making was performed to identify key predictors of selection changes. No sources of funding were required for this study and there are no conflicts of interests. Results Fifty-four patients with a mean age of 55.8 years participated in the study. Thirteen (24.1%) consistently selected a single approach, whereas 31 (57.4%) changed their selection more than once during the interviewing process. Overall, 12 patients (22.2%) had a final decision different from their initial choice, and 15 patients (27.8%) were unable to decide. A large proportion of patients (65.0%) initially favored the open approach's midline incision. This proportion dropped to 16.7% (p<.001) upon mention of the term MIS. The proportion of patients favoring MIS dropped significantly following discussion on the pros and cons (p=.002) of each approach, as well as conversion or revision surgery (p=.017). Radiation and cosmesis were identified as the two most important factors influencing patients' final decisions. Conclusions The longer midline incision of the open approach is cosmetically more appealing to patients than the paramedian stab wounds of MIS. The advantages of the MIS approach may not be as valued by patients as they are by surgeons. Given the equivalent long-term outcomes of both approaches, it is crucial that patients are adequately informed during preoperative counseling to achieve the best consensus decision.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.0382921
2782,"Determinant factors for sperm transfer and sperm storage within Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae) and impact on Sterile Insect Technique. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is a method of pest control used in the management of Ceratitis capitata (Medfly). This technique is based on the mating and transfer of ejaculate sperm to the wild female population from released sterile males. This transfer will induce sterility in the female through sperm dominant lethal mutations. Consequently, the factors influencing sperm transfer and sperm storage are issues that must be understood to enable successful SIT implementation. Age, size, nutritional status, copula duration, and irradiation are the most important factors that affect sperm transfer and storage. Inconsistent results from studies investigating the influence of these factors on sperm transfer/storage may be due to, the strain of fly studied and variability in the sexual experience of the flies used. In this review, we highlight the interaction between these factors, issues that still need to be addressed, and propose future directions for the improvement of medfly males' sexual performance and the successful application of SIT against this pest.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

2783,"Effect of Cisplatin on parotid gland function in concomitant radiochemotherapy. PURPOSE: To determine the influence of concomitant radiochemotherapy with cisplatin on parotid gland tissue complication probability., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients treated with either radiotherapy (n = 61) or concomitant radiochemotherapy with cisplatin (n = 36) for head-and-neck cancer were prospectively evaluated. The dose and volume distributions of the parotid glands were noted in dose-volume histograms. Stimulated salivary flow rates were measured before, during the 2(nd) and 6(th) weeks and at 4 weeks and 6 months after the treatment. The data were fit using the normal tissue complication probability model of Lyman. Complication was defined as a reduction of the salivary flow rate to less than 25% of the pretreatment flow rate., RESULTS: The normal tissue complication probability model parameter TD(50) (the dose leading to a complication probability of 50%) was found to be 32.2 Gy at 4 weeks and 32.1 Gy at 6 months for concomitant radiochemotherapy and 41.1 Gy at 4 weeks and 39.6 Gy at 6 months for radiotherapy. The tolerated dose for concomitant radiochemotherapy was at least 7 to 8 Gy lower than for radiotherapy alone at TD(50)., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the concomitant radiochemotherapy tended to cause a higher probability of parotid gland tissue damage. Advanced radiotherapy planning approaches such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy may be particularly important for parotid sparing in radiochemotherapy because of cisplatin-related increased radiosensitivity of glands.",Excluded,0.04042224
2784,"Parotid gland-recovery after radiotherapy in the head and neck region - 36 months follow-up of a prospective clinical study. Background: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the recovery potential of the parotid glands after using either 3D-conformal-radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) by sparing one single parotid gland. Method(s): Between 06/2002 and 10/2008, 117 patients with head and neck cancer were included in this prospective, non-randomised clinical study. All patients were treated with curative intent. Salivary gland function was assessed by measuring stimulated salivary flow at the beginning, during and at the end of radiotherapy as well as 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after treatment. Measurements were converted to flow rates and normalized relative to rates before treatment. Mean doses (Dmean) were calculated from dose-volume histograms based on computed tomographies of the parotid glands. Result(s): Patients were grouped according to the Dmean of the spared parotid gland having the lowest radiation exposure: Group I - Dmean < 26 Gy (n = 36), group II - Dmean 26-40 Gy (n = 45), and group III - Dmean > 40 Gy (n = 36). 15/117 (13%) patients received IMRT. By using IMRT as compared to 3D-CRT the Dmean of the spared parotid gland could be significantly reduced (Dmean IMRT vs. 3D-CRT: 21.7 vs. 34.4 Gy, p < 0.001). The relative salivary flow rates (RFSR) as a function of the mean parotid dose after 24 and 36 months was in group I 66% and 74%, in group II 56% and 49%, and in group III 31% and 24%, respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that the parotid gland dose and the tumor site were the independent determinants 12 and 36 months after the end of RT. Patients of group I and II parotid gland function did recover at 12, 24, and 36 months after the end of RT. Conclusion(s): If a Dmean < 26 Gy for at least one parotid gland can be achieved then this is sufficient to reach complete recovery of pre-RT salivary flow rates. The radiation volume which depends on tumor site did significantly impact on the Dmean of the parotids, and thus on the saliva flow and recovery of parotid gland.Copyright © 2011 Hey et al.",Excluded,0.038252797

Objectives This study sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transradial versus transfemoral access for coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with a body mass index <40 kg/m 2.Background Coronary angiography is most commonly performed via femoral artery access; however, the optimal approach in extremely obese (EO) patients remains unclear. Methods Between January 2007 and August 2010, a cohort of consecutive EO patients who underwent coronary angiography was identified in our center's registry of angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention procedures. Of 21,103 procedures, 564 (2.7%) were performed in unique EO patients: 203 (36%) via the transradial approach; and 361 (64%) via the transfemoral approach.Results The primary outcome, a combined endpoint of major bleeding, access site complications, and nonaccess site complications, occurred in 7.5% of the transfemoral group and 2.0% of the transradial group (odds ratio [OR]: 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10 to 0.88, p = 0.029), an endpoint driven by reductions in major bleeding (3.3% vs. 0.0%, OR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0 to 0.71, p = 0.015), as well as access site injuries (4.7% vs. 0.0%, OR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0 to 0.48, p = 0.002). There were no differences in nonaccess site complications (1.7% vs. 2.0%, OR: 1.50, 95% CI: 0.41 to 5.55), but transradial access procedures were associated with an increase in procedure time and patient radiation dose (p < 0.05).Conclusions Transfemoral access for coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention was associated with more bleeding and access site complications when compared with a transradial approach.

The clinical results after stereotactic single-dose radiotherapy of nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stages I and II were evaluated. METHODS. Forty-two patients with biopsy-proven NSCLC received stereotactic radiotherapy. Patients were treated in a stereotactic body frame and breathing motion was reduced by abdominal compression. The single doses used ranged between 19 and 30 Gy/isocenter. RESULTS. After a median follow-up period of 15 months (range, 1.5-72 months) the actuarial overall survival rates and disease-free survival rates were 74.5%, 65.4%, 37.4%, and 70.2%, 49.1%, 49.1% at 12, 24, and 36 months after therapy, respectively. The actuarial local tumor control rates were 89.5%, 67.9%, and 67.9% at 12, 24, and 36 months after therapy, respectively. A significant difference (P = .032) in local tumor control was found for patients receiving 26-30 Gy (n = 32) compared with doses of less than 26 Gy (n = 10). The effect of the tumor volume on local tumor control was also evaluated. Although the difference was not statistically significant (P = .078), the subgroup of tumors with a tumor volume of less than 12 cm3 (n = 10) experienced no tumor recurrence. Thirteen (31%) patients developed metastases during follow-up, whereas isolated regional lymph node recurrence was only encountered in 2 patients. No clinically significant treatment-associated side effects were documented. CONCLUSIONS. Stereotactic single-dose radiotherapy is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with early stage NSCLC not suitable for surgery. Especially for small tumor volumes it seems to be equally effective as hypofractionated radiotherapy, while minimizing the overall treatment time. © 2007 American Cancer Society.",Excluded,0.038611993

Radiation-associated coronary atherosclerosis is a potential problem for patients who have had mediastinal irradiation for malignant tumors. This study identified 14 patients with radiation-associated coronary atherosclerosis, defines unique population characteristics, and analyses postsurgical problems and long-term outcome. Fourteen patients with radiation-associated coronary atherosclerosis and class III and IV New York Heart Association symptoms were identified because of mediastinal or chest wall irradiation (30 Gy) associated with anterior epicardial discoloration or fibrosis, aortitis with adventitial thickening, and inflammatory process over a proximal coronary artery. Two distinct treatment groups were analyzed. Coronary artery operation resulted in one hospital death, with vein grafts being used predominantly. The internal mammary artery could only be used in 3 patients because of vessel friability and mediastinal fibrosis. Postoperative right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary problems were frequent. Severe pericardial inflammatory complications (fibrosis with graft closure, and constrictive pericarditis) present in 2 early patients resulted in routine anterior pericardiectomy after coronary artery operation without further problems. Long-term follow-up (100%) (range, 11 to 74 months) revealed that 1 patient died late and of the remainder (12 patients), 11 were in New York Heart Association class I and 1 in class II, experiencing three myocardial events. Thus, patients with radiation-associated coronary atherosclerosis have a low operative mortality but have risk of early right ventricular and pulmonary dysfunction.

2790,"The effects of exposure to microgravity and reconditioning of the lumbar multifidus and anterolateral abdominal muscles: implications for people with LBP. BACKGROUND CONTEXT: One of the primary changes in the neuromuscular system in response to microgravity is skeletal muscle atrophy, which occurs especially in muscles that maintain posture while being upright on Earth. Reduced size of paraspinal and abdominal muscles has been documented after spaceflight. Exercises are undertaken on the International Space Station (ISS) during and following space flight to remediate these effects. Understanding the adaptations which occur in trunk muscles in response to microgravity could inform the development of specific countermeasures, which may have applications for people with conditions on Earth such as low back pain (LBP). PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the changes in muscle size and function of the lumbar multifidus (MF) and anterolateral abdominal muscles (1) in response to exposure to 6 months of microgravity on the ISS and (2) in response to a 15-day reconditioning program on Earth. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal series. PATIENT SAMPLE: Data were collected from five astronauts who undertook seven long-duration missions on the ISS. OUTCOME MEASURES: For the MF muscle, measures included cross-sectional area (CSA) and linear measures to assess voluntary isometric contractions at vertebral levels L2 to L5. For the abdominal muscles, the thickness of the transversus abdominis (TrA), obliquus internus abdominis (IO) and obliquus externus abdominis (EO) muscles at rest and on contraction were measured. METHOD(S): Ultrasound imaging of trunk muscles was conducted at four timepoints (preflight, postflight, mid-reconditioning, and post reconditioning). Data were analyzed using multilevel linear models to estimate the change in muscle parameters of interest across three time periods. RESULT(S): Beta-coefficients (estimates of the expected change in the measure across the specified time period, adjusted for the baseline measurement) indicated that the CSA of the MF muscles decreased significantly at all lumbar vertebral levels (except L2) in response to exposure to microgravity (L3=12.6%; L4=6.1%, L5=10.3%; p<.001), and CSAs at L3-L5 vertebral levels increased in the reconditioning period (p<.001). The thickness of the TrA decreased by 34.1% (p<.017), IO decreased by 15.4% (p=.04), and the combination of anterolateral abdominal muscles decreased by 16.2% (p<.001) between pre- and postflight assessment and increased (TrA<0.008; combined p=.035) during the postreconditioning period. Results showed decreased contraction of the MF muscles at the L2 (from 12.8% to 3.4%; p=.007) and L3 (from 12.2% to 5%; p=.032) vertebral levels following exposure to microgravity which increased (L2, p=.046) after the postreconditioning period. Comparison with preflight measures indicated that there were no residual changes in muscle size and function after the postreconditioning period, apart from CSA of MF at L2, which remained 15.3% larger than preflight values (p<.001). CONCLUSION(S): In-flight exercise countermeasures mitigated, but did not completely prevent, changes in the size and function of the lumbar MF and anterolateral abdominal muscles. Many of the observed changes in size and control of the MF and abdominal muscles that occurred in response to prolonged exposure to microgravity paralleled those seen in people with LBP or exposed to prolonged bed rest on Earth. Daily individualized postflight reconditioning, which included both motor control training and weight-bearing exercises with an emphasis on retraining strength and endurance to re-establish normal postural alignment with respect to gravity, restored the decreased size and control of the MF (at the L3-L5 vertebral levels) and anterolateral abdominal muscles. Drawing parallels between changes which occur to the neuromuscular system in microgravity and which exercises best recover muscle size and function could help health professionals tailor improved interventions for terrestrial populations. Results suggested that the principles underpinning the exercises developed for astronauts following prolonged exposure to microg avity (emphasizing strength and endurance training to re-establish normal postural alignment and distribution of load with respect to gravity) can also be applied for people with chronic LBP, as the MF and anterolateral abdominal muscles were affected in similar ways in both populations. The results may also inform the development of new astronaut countermeasures targeting the MF and abdominal muscles.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.03835425

With multivariate analysis, only microscopic tumor outside the CTV (hazard ratio [HR], 4.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-15.36), and perineural growth (HR, 5.77; 95% CI, 1.27-26.13) were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS. The 1-year OS was 20% for patients with tumor outside the CTV and 86% for those without (P<.01). For DFS, microscopic tumor outside the CTV (HR, 5.92; 95% CI, 1.89-18.54) and ypN+ (HR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.33-8.48) were identified as independent adverse prognostic factors. The 1-year DFS was 23% versus 77% for patients with or without tumor outside the CTV (P<.01). Conclusions Microscopic tumor outside the CTV is associated with markedly worse OS after neo-CRT. This may either stress the importance of accurate tumor delineation or reflect aggressive tumor behavior requiring new adjuvant treatment modalities. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

2792,"Value of a multinational approach in determining the causation of cancer. MacMahon and Pugh define epidemiology as the use of knowledge on the frequency and distribution of disease to search for determinants. This paper demonstrates that a multinational approach in cancer epidemiology can be of great value in at least four circumstances: namely, the compilation and standardization of data, the assessment of risk, the pooling of study populations to obtain interpretable results, and the provision of resources for specific epidemiologic investigations. One or two examples are given for each category--the determination of international cancer incidence patterns, the evaluation of the risk posed by chemicals to man, assessment of the effects of low doses of ionizing radiation, determination of the long-term effects of exposure to asbestos substitutes, and studies on the influence of diet on esophageal cancer.",Excluded,0.7570225

A variety of experimental tumour models have shown that cisplatin in combination with ionizing radiation enhances tumour regression. To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and toxicity of a combined regimen, 25 patients with different solid tumours were treated with cisplatin and photon irradiation. A local tumour control was achieved in 22 cases. Thirteen patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (T1-3, N1-2, M0) received cisplatin (20 mg/m2 per day) on 5 consecutive days with NaCl hyperhydratation (0,9% NaCl, 2400 ml/24 hours as continuous infusion) in the first and last week of radiotherapy (5 X 2 Gy/week, 56 Gy target volume dose). 12 of 13 patients have shown local tumour control. Increased clinically evident side effects were not observed. From the underlying data the conclusion is drawn that the experimental results are reproducable under clinical conditions and that improved local tumour response rates can be achieved.",Excluded,0.038467754
2794,"Genetic variants in inflammation-related genes are associated with radiation-induced toxicity following treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is often accompanied by the development of esophagitis and pneumonitis. Identifying patients who might be at increased risk for normal tissue toxicity would help in determination of the optimal radiation dose to avoid these events. We profiled 59 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 37 inflammation-related genes in 173 NSCLC patients with stage IIIA/IIIB (dry) disease who were treated with definitive radiation or chemoradiation. For esophagitis risk, nine SNPs were associated with a 1.5- to 4-fold increase in risk, including three PTGS2 (COX2) variants: rs20417 (HR:1.93, 95% CI:1.10-3.39), rs5275 (HR:1.58, 95% CI:1.09-2.27), and rs689470 (HR:3.38, 95% CI:1.09-10.49). Significantly increased risk of pneumonitis was observed for patients with genetic variation in the proinflammatory genes IL1A, IL8, TNF, TNFRSF1B, and MIF. In contrast, NOS3:rs1799983 displayed a protective effect with a 45% reduction in pneumonitis risk (HR:0.55, 95% CI:0.31-0.96). Pneumonitis risk was also modulated by polymorphisms in anti-inflammatory genes, including genetic variation in IL13. rs20541 and rs180925 each resulted in increased risk (HR:2.95, 95% CI:1.14-7.63 and HR:3.23, 95% CI:1.03-10.18, respectively). The cumulative effect of these SNPs on risk was dose-dependent, as evidenced by a significantly increased risk of either toxicity with an increasing number of risk genotypes (P,0.001). These results suggest that genetic variations among inflammation pathway genes may modulate the development of radiation-induced toxicity and, ultimately, help in identifying patients who are at an increased likelihood for such events. 2010 Hildebrandt et al.",Excluded,0.9706716
2795,"Mortality and cancer incidence following occupational radiation exposure: third analysis of the National Registry for Radiation Workers. Mortality and cancer incidence were studied in the National Registry for Radiation Workers in, relative to earlier analyses, an enlarged cohort of 174 541 persons, with longer follow-up (to 2001) and, for the first time, cancer registration data. SMRs for all causes and all malignant neoplasms were 81 and 84 respectively, demonstrating a 'healthy worker effect'. Within the cohort, mortality and incidence from both leukaemia excluding CLL and the grouping of all malignant neoplasms excluding leukaemia increased to a statistically significant extent with increasing radiation dose. Estimates of the trend in risk with dose were similar to those for the Japanese A-bomb survivors, with 90% confidence intervals that excluded both risks more than 2-3 times greater than the A-bomb values and no raised risk. Some evidence of an increasing trend with dose in mortality from all circulatory diseases may, at least partly, be due to confounding by smoking. This analysis provides the most precise estimates to date of mortality and cancer risks following occupational radiation exposure and strengthens the evidence for raised risks from these exposures. The cancer risk estimates are consistent with values used to set radiation protection standards.",Included,0.9707752
2796,"Economic Analysis of a Three-Arm RCT Exploring the Delivery of Intensive, Prophylactic Swallowing Therapy to Patients with Head and Neck Cancer During (Chemo)Radiotherapy. Research advocates for the use of intensive, prophylactic swallowing therapy to help reduce the severity of dysphagia in patients receiving (chemo)radiotherapy ([C]RT) for head/neck cancer (HNC). Unfortunately, the intensity of this therapy, coupled with growing patient numbers and limited clinical resources, provides challenges to many international cancer facilities. Telepractice has been proposed as a potential method to provide patients with greater support in home-practice, whilst minimising burden to the health service. This study investigated the clinical and patient-attributable costs of delivering an intensive, prophylactic swallowing therapy protocol via a new telepractice application ""SwallowIT"" as compared to clinician-directed FTF therapy and independent patient self-directed therapy. Patients (n = 79) with oropharyngeal HNC receiving definitive (C)RT were randomised to receive therapy via a: clinician-directed (n = 26), patient-directed (n = 27), or SwallowIT-assisted (n = 26) model of care. Data pertaining to health service costs (service time, consumables, therapy resources), patient-attributable costs (travel and wages) and patient-reported health-related quality of life (QoL) (AQoL-6D) were collected. SwallowIT provided a cost-efficient model of care when compared to the clinician-directed model, with significant cost savings to both the health service and to HNC consumers (total saving of $1901.10 AUD per patient; p < 0.001). The SwallowIT model also proved more cost-effective than the patient-directed model, yielding clinically significantly superior QoL at the end of (C)RT, for comparable costs. Overall, when compared to the alternate methods of service-delivery, SwallowIT provided a financially viable and cost-effective method for the delivery of intensive, prophylactic swallowing therapy to patients with HNC during (C)RT.Copyright © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded,0.03846944
2797,"Dosimetric analysis and clinical outcomes in CT-based mould brachytherapy in early oral cancers in patients unfit for surgery. Purpose: Brachytherapy in the oral cavity is an important alternative to conventional treatment, and provides a high localized dose and short overall treatment time. A rapid fall of dose beyond radioactive source makes it possible for increased tumour control and sparing surrounding tissue, while short overall treatment duration reduces risk of tumour repopulation. Moulds are fabricated to hold the catheters in position as closely as possible to tumour surface to provide adequate dose coverage of tumour volume and increase distance to other normal surrounding structures. Image based planning and dose optimisation help in better defining target volume and dose coverage. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective analysis of patients of early squamous cell carcinomas of lip and buccal mucosa from September 2011 to June 2014 to study response to mould brachytherapy. Double plane moulds were prepared for all lip cancer cases and single plane for buccal mucosa cases. Patients are being followed up till disease recurrence. In this study evaluation was done of the technique used, planning details, response to therapy, and reactions encountered. Result(s): Nine patients treated by mould therapy were reviewed; seven cases were of lip and two of buccal mucosal cancers. Dose delivered ranged from 12.5-48 Gy in fraction sizes of 2.5-3.5 Gy. Equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) ranged from 18-64 Gy. Maximum dose to organs at risk (OAR) was 91% of prescribed dose. Local mucositis was only reaction in all cases, which resolved in 3-6 weeks. Median follow-up was 19 months. Eight out of nine patients are in remission at a minimum of 7 months (1 case, rest over 14 months) post therapy and only one patient had nodal recurrence at 18 months. Conclusion(s): Mould therapy is an effective treatment method for selected early and superficial squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, although indications are limited.Copyright © 2015, Termedia Publishing House Ltd.

The purpose of this prospective study was to compare the performance of standard-dose MDCT with that of low-dose MDCT with tube current modulation in patients with renal colic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Three hundred patients underwent 6- and 16-MDCT in 150 standard-dose examinations (6-MDCT effective tube current, 95 mAs at 130 kV; 16-MDCT effective tube current, 120 mAs at 120 kV) and 150 low-dose examinations (6-MDCT effective tube current, 51 mAs at 110 kV; 16-MDCT effective tube current, 70 mAs at 120 kV), all performed with 4D tube current modulation. Two experienced radiologists using a clinical workstation and blinded to scan parameters prospectively viewed the images from the 300 examinations. In a second session, one experienced radiologist and two first-year residents using a clinical workstation retrospectively reviewed images from 100 randomly selected standard-dose and 100 randomly selected low-dose examinations. RESULTS. Tube current modulation reduced effective tube current 25-31% in all examinations. Mean effective dose was 1.41-1.58 mSv for low-dose examinations, which reached additional dose reduction of 51.2-64.3% in comparison with standard-dose examinations. Excellent correlation existed between mean tube current and body mass index of the patients. Spearman's correlation coefficient was 0.85-0.88 for all examinations. The sensitivity of low-dose examinations interpreted by two experienced reviewers was 97.3-98.6%; specificity, 93.5%; and accuracy, 95.3%. These findings were comparable with those for standard-dose examinations. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of low-dose examinations of overweight and obese patients reached similar high values: 97-100%, 100%, and 98-100%, respectively. Interobserver agreement for urinary stone detection was excellent between the two reviewers, with kappa values of 0.98 for the low-dose and 0.96 for the standard-dose examinations. An alternative diagnosis was identified in 15% and 16% of cases by two experienced radiologists in the two examinations groups. In the second interpretation session, the residents found an alternative diagnosis in only 10-12% of standard-dose examinations and only 4-5% of low-dose examinations. CONCLUSION. Low-dose MDCT with tube current modulation can be used as standard procedure in evaluation for urolithiasis, even in overweight and obese patients. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded,0.038495697
2800,"Altered senescence, apoptosis, and DNA damage response in a mutant p53 model of accelerated aging. The tumor suppressors p16(INK4a) and p53 have been implicated as contributors to age-associated stem cell decline. Key functions of p53 are the induction of cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Here, we examine senescence, apoptosis, and DNA damage responses in a mouse accelerated aging model that exhibits increased p53 activity, the p53(+/m) mouse. Aged tissues of p53(+/m) mice display higher percentages of senescent cells (as determined by senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining and p16(INK4a) and p21 accumulation) compared to aged tissues from p53(+/+) mice. Surprisingly, despite having enhanced p53 activity, p53(+/m) lymphoid tissues exhibit reduced apoptotic activity in response to ionizing radiation compared to p53(+/+) tissues. Ionizing radiation treatment of p53(+/m) tissues also induces higher and prolonged levels of senescence markers p16(INK4a) and p21, suggesting that in p53(+/m) tissues the p53 stress response is enhanced and is shifted away from apoptosis toward senescence. One potential mechanism for accelerated aging in the p53(+/m) mouse is a failure to remove damaged or dysfunctional cells (including stem and progenitor cells) through apoptosis. The increased accumulation of dysfunctional and senescent cells may contribute to reduced tissue regeneration, tissue atrophy, and some of the accelerated aging phenotypes in p53(+/m) mice.",Excluded,0.9689668

2802,"Mechanism of low-level microwave radiation effect on nervous system. The aim of this study is to explain the mechanism of the effect of low-level modulated microwave radiation on brain bioelectrical oscillations. The proposed model of excitation by low-level microwave radiation bases on the influence of water polarization on hydrogen bonding forces between water molecules, caused by this the enhancement of diffusion and consequences on neurotransmitters transit time and neuron resting potential. Modulated microwave radiation causes periodic alteration of the neurophysiologic parameters and parametric excitation of brain bioelectric oscillations. The experiments to detect logical outcome of the mechanism on physiological level were carried out on 15 human volunteers. The 450-MHz microwave radiation modulated at 7, 40 and 1000 Hz frequencies was applied at the field power density of 0.16 mW/cm2. A relative change in the EEG power with and without radiation during 10 cycles was used as a quantitative measure. Experimental data demonstrated that modulated at 40 Hz microwave radiation enhanced EEG power in EEG alpha and beta frequency bands. No significant alterations were detected at 7 and 1000 Hz modulation frequencies. These results are in good agreement with the theory of parametric excitation of the brain bioelectric oscillations caused by the periodic alteration of neurophysiologic parameters and support the proposed mechanism. The proposed theoretical framework has been shown to predict the results of experimental study. The suggested mechanism, free of the restrictions related to field strength or time constant, is the first one providing explanation of low-level microwave radiation effects.",Excluded,0.55626154

Two-cell mouse embryos were exposed in vitro to tributyl phosphate, x rays, or a combination of both. In-vitro development of the embryos was followed microscopically (cleavage to four- and eight-cell embryos, formation of morulae and blastocysts, and hatching of blastocysts). Effects on proliferation were estimated by counting the number of cells per embryo early (48 h p.c. = 48 hours post conceptionem) and late (144 h p.c.) in the preimplantation period. Cytogenetic damage was studied using micronucleus formation as the end point. Tributyl phosphate did not reveal toxic effects up to a concentration of about 5 microM after an exposure time of 18 h. At a concentration of about 15 microM, 50% of late preimplantation embryos showed effects on morphological development and on cell proliferation, and at about 40 microM, 90% of the embryos were affected. Tributyl phosphate did not induce micronuclei. Small effects by x irradiation were observed between 0.25 Gy and 0.5 Gy, depending on the end point measured in the late preimplantation stage. Fifty percent of the embryos were affected by a dose slightly higher than 1 Gy, and 90% after about 4 Gy.

Background: JCOG0909 is a phase II trial of definitive chemoradiotherapy including salvage treatment for cStage II-III thoracic esophageal cancer; the radiation field for elective regional lymph node irradiation, which can affect patient outcome and adverse event, varied based on the primary tumor site, i.e., upper (Ut), middle (Mt), and lower thoracic (Lt) esophagus. The impact of different primary sites on the safety and efficacy of definitive chemoradiotherapy in JCOG0909 is not well characterized. Method(s): Patients were categorized into three groups (Ut, Mt, and Lt) according to the primary tumor location. We compared acute adverse events during definitive chemoradiotherapy, complete response (CR) rate, 3-year progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) among the 3 groups. Result(s): Out of the 96 patients enrolled in JCOG0909 between April 2010 and August 2014, 94 patients (16, 59, and 19 patients in the Ut, Mt, and Lt groups, respectively) were included in this exploratory analysis. The proportion of patients with cStage III was 25% in the Ut, 37% in the Mt, and 47% in the Lt group. Grade 3-4 leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were more frequently observed in the Mt (66%, 54%, and 15%) and Lt groups (84%, 68%, and 16%) than in the Ut group (38%, 44%, and 0%). There was no significant between-group difference with respect to 3-year OS (73.3%, 77.9%, and 57.9%), 3-year PFS (60.0%, 59.3%, and 47.4%), or CR rate (62.5%, 62.7%, and 42.1%).

2807,"Radiation necrosis versus glioma recurrence: conventional MR imaging clues to diagnosis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional MR imaging findings are considered to be inadequate for reliably distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence in patients with glioma. Despite this belief, we hypothesized that certain conventional MR imaging findings, alone or in combination, though not definitive, may favor one or another of these diagnoses in proton beam-treated patients with new enhancing lesions on serial scanning. METHOD(S): MR imaging findings (axial T1-, T2-, and post-gadolinium T1-weighted) of 27 proton beam radiation therapy patients with high-grade gliomas were retrospectively reviewed. Entry criteria included new MR imaging enhancing lesions after treatment and histologically unequivocal biopsy proof of diagnosis. Readers rated corpus callosum involvement, midline spread, subependymal spread, new discrete multiple enhancing foci, a ""spreading wavefront"" appearance, and septum pellucidum involvement. Statistical analysis was by the Fisher exact test. RESULT(S): Corpus callosum involvement in combination with multiple other findings was highly associated with progressive glioma. These combinations included involvement of the corpus callosum with multiple enhancing foci (P = .02), involvement of the corpus callosum with crossing the midline and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .04), and involvement of the corpus callosum with subependymal spread and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .01). CONCLUSION(S): In proton beam-treated patients with glioma, corpus callosum involvement, in conjunction with multiple enhancing lesions with or without crossing of the midline and subependymal spread, favors predominant glioma progression. Overall, combinations of enhancement patterns were more likely than individual patterns to distinguish necrosis from predominant tumor progression.

All patients included were within ambulant control for at least 2.5 months following treatment. According to the pretreatment Tc-99m pertechnetate scan 59% (220/375) had multifocal (MF), 23% (86/375) unifocal (UF), 10% (38/375) mixed focal-disseminated (FD) and 8% (31/375) disseminated (D) scintigraphic patterns., RESULTS: In 93.9% (352/375), the autonomous tissue was totally, in 2.1% (8/375) partially and in 1.6% (6/375) insufficiently eliminated. In 2.4% (9/375) a relapse of hyperthyroidism was observed 2 to 10 months following I-131 therapy. In 8 patients a relapse of hyperthyroidism was accompanied or followed by an elevation of the previously non-elevated TSH-receptor antibody (TRAb) level and in 1 patient by an TRAb increase to the upper borderline range implicating Graves' disease. With the prevalence of Graves' disease following I-131 therapy a statistically significant difference in pretreatment Tc-99m pertechnetate scintigraphic patterns was found: 0% of unifocal (0/86) or multifocal (0/220), however 18% (7/38) of focal-disseminated and 7% (2/31) of disseminated scintigraphic patterns.

2810,"Leukopenia is a biomarker for effective temozolomide dosing and predicts overall survival of patients with glioblastoma. The median survival time of patients with glioblastoma is 14-16 months with a 5-year overall survival rate of 9.8%. Standard of care treatment includes radiation with concomitant temozolomide followed by cyclic temozolomide. If the patient develops myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia or anemia), the dose of temozolomide is reduced or stopped to avoid bleeding or infections. Recent studies have demonstrated that mild leukopenia is associated with increased overall survival in patients with glioblastoma. To confirm prior results showing that leukopenia is associated with increased overall survival as a primary outcome in patients with glioblastoma, the present study retrospectively collected complete blood counts from 141 patients with glioblastoma treated at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, USA) between January 2012 and December 2017. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis with a log-rank test, the presence of leukopenia was associated with increased overall survival (P=0.008). Furthermore, patients with grade 2 leukopenia (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0) survived longer than those without myelosuppression (P=0.024). There was no difference in overall survival between patients with grade 1, 3 or 4 leukopenia and those without myelosuppression. Leukopenia was associated with longer survival independent of age or extent of surgery in Cox proportional hazards regression modeling (P=0.00205). A possible interpretation is that grade 2 leukopenia is a biomarker of adequate temozolomide dosing in a population with diverse DNA repair function, which may be the consequence of variable O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity. A prospective dose escalation trial is necessary to determine if treatment-induced leukopenia is beneficial for all patients receiving temozolomide.Copyright © 2020, Spandidos Publications.

UNLABELLED: This study sought to extract information on individual patient habitus from scout imaging and to correlate radiograph tube current settings with enhancement of the coronaries as a function of patient profiles for coronary multidetector computed tomography., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients underwent coronary 64-slice multidetector computed tomography consisting of 2-plane scouts and electrocardiography-gated coronary studies at 64 x 0.625 mm, radiograph voltage of 120 kVp, and radiograph currents of 295 to 788 mA, which were reconstructed during 65%, 75%, and 85% R-R intervals. Patients' weight was recorded. On scout imaging, chest diameters were determined, and circumferences were calculated. To determine whether body weight showed sex-specific characteristics, t test was used. Pearson correlation determined whether cross-sectional measurements reflected female/male body habitus. On coronary imaging, contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of the aorta and the coronaries were calculated. To assess whether CNRs differed throughout the diastolic phase, t test was used. Data triplets of CNRs and the corresponding current and circumference were plotted; CNRs less than 250 Hounsfield unit (HU) were discarded, dissecting lines as 95th percentiles correlating radiograph currents and patients' circumferences were calculated., RESULTS: Female/male weights differed significantly (P = 0.0006); circumferences based on scouts adequately reflected body weight (coefficients, 0.86 male/0.87 female). Homogenous vascular enhancement of the aorta (mean +/- SD, 344.4 +/- 81.8 HU) and the right (292.3 +/- 82.8 HU) and left (285.8 +/- 81.3 HU) coronaries was achieved (P > 0.005). Ninety-fifth percentile cutoffs identified linear relationships between patient's circumference and the minimal adequate radiograph current achieving CNR less than or equal to 250 HU., CONCLUSION: Scout imaging can be used to determine individual patient habitus; habitus-adjusted minimal radiograph tube current cutoff levels identified in this study ensuring clinically required levels of coronary enhancement can be used for future coronary CT angiography optimization of tube current based on scout imaging.",Excluded,0.038206615

Purpose: Magnetic resonance-guided laser-induced thermal therapy (MRgLITT) is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat various intracranial pathologies. This study investigated the effects of variable power on maximal estimated thermal damage during ablation and duration required to reach maximal ablation. Materials/Methods: All ablations were performed using the Visualase Thermal Therapy System (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota), which uses a 980 nm diffusing tip diode laser. Cases were stratified into low, medium and high power. Maximal thermal damage estimate (TDEmax) achieved in a single plane and time to reach maximal damage (ttdemax) were measured and compared between groups using a 2x3 Fixed Factor Analysis of Covariance. Ablation area change for cases in which an initial thermal dose was followed by a subsequent dose, with increased power, was also assessed. Result(s): We used real-time ablation data from 93 patients across various intracranial pathologies. ttdemax (mean +/- SEM) decreased linearly as power increased (low: 139.2 +/- 10.4 s, medium: 127.5 +/- 4.3 s, high: 103.7 +/- 5.8 s). In cases where a second thermal dose was delivered at higher power, the TDE expanded an average of 51.4 mm2 beyond the initial TDE generated by the first ablation, with the second ablation approaching TDEmax at a higher rate than the initial ablation. Conclusion(s): Increased power results in a larger TDEmax and an increased ablation rate. In cases where an initial thermal dose does not fully ablate the target lesion, a second ablation at higher power can increase the area of ablation with an increased ablation rate.Copyright © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded,0.038325295
2813,"Outcomes of surgical management of peptic ulcer perforation using the falciform ligament: A cross-sectional study at a single centre in Vietnam. Introduction: Peptic ulcer perforation (PUP) is one of the most common critical surgical emergencies. The omentum flap is commonly used to cover a PUP. However, the omentum cannot be used in cases of severe peritonitis or previous surgical removal. This is the first study conducted in Vietnam that was designed to analyse the outcomes of patients with PUPs who were treated using the falciform ligament. Method(s): In this study, we retrospectively identified 40 consecutive patients who were treated for PUP at a single high-volume centre in Vietnam from February 2018 to February 2021. Peptic ulcer perforation was measured during diagnostic evaluation based on preoperative imaging, such as X-ray, and CT scan. Patients who had malignancy, laparoscopic surgery, omentopexy and nonoperative treatment were excluded from this research. Result(s): Forty patients were included; the mean age of the patients was 66.3 years (range 33-99 years), and some patients had comorbid disease (57.5%), hypertension (30%), diabetes (10%), cirrhosis (7.5%), and chronic renal failure (7.5%). The PUPs were located in the duodenum (80%), or the pyloric (15%) and prepyloric (5%) regions. The procedures used to treat the patients included duodenostomy (32.5%), gastrojejunostomy (37.5%), and antrum resection (2.5%). The average operative time was 88.6 min (45-180 min), hospital stay was 9.6 days (2-35 days), and oral intake was started at 4.1 days (3-8 days); additionally, the 30-day mortality (17.5%) and incidences of pneumonia (25%), multiorgan failure (15%), acute liver failure (5%), wound infection (7.5%), and ulcer peptic fistula (0%) were assessed. Univariate tests showed that an ASA >= III and comorbidities, such as pulmonary complications, liver failure and multiorgan failure, were associated with mortality. The multivariate test showed that multiorgan failure was the only factor related to mortality. Conclusion(s): The falciform ligament can be efficiently used for the closure of a PUP. Although there were no instances of complication with a reperforated peptic ulcer, the mortality rate was slightly highly related to severe comorbidities and postoperative multiorgan failure.Copyright © 2021",Excluded,0.038321484
2814,"Evaluation of organ-at-risk dose reduction with jaw tracking technique in flattening filter-free beams in lung stereotactic body radiation therapy. PURPOSE: (i) to investigate the capability of organ-at-risk (OAR) dose reduction with the jaw tracking (JT) technique in flattening filter-free (FFF) beams in lung stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), (ii) to propose a novel metric to quantify the jaw movements during JT, and (iii) to examine the relationships between the quantified jaw movements and reduction rate of OAR doses., METHODS: The individual SBRT plans with volumetric modulated arc therapy using the JT technique (JT-VMAT) and VMAT plans with a fixed jaw (FJ-VMAT) were created for 15 patients, and dosimetric parameters were compared. A jaw tracking complexity score (JTCS) was defined and compared with the multi-leaf collimator (MLC) modulation complexity score (MCS). The correlations between the JTCS and reduction rate of OAR doses were examined., RESULTS: The decrease of OARs doses was statistically significant in the JT-VMAT plans (1.2% in V20 of the lung and <1% in all other OARs). The correlations between the JTCS and MCS were not significant. There were significant correlations between the JTCS and the reduction rates in V20, V2.5, and Dmean of the lung, D1% of the spinal cord, and D90% of the body., CONCLUSIONS: A significant decrease of dosimetric parameters of OARs was found with JT-VMAT in FFF beams. This reduction is very small and probably not clinically relevant. JTCS, a novel metric to quantify the jaw movements during JT, was proposed, and the complexity of jaw movements did not correlate with that of the movements of MLC leaves. There were significant correlations between the JTCS and some dosimetric parameters of OARs. Copyright © 2019 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

2816,"Effects of motion segment level, Pfirrmann intervertebral disc degeneration grade and gender on lumbar spine kinematics. MRI allows non-invasive assessment of intervertebral disc degeneration with the added clinical benefit of using non-ionizing radiation. What has remained unclear is the relationship between assessed disc degeneration and lumbar spine kinematics. Kinematic outcomes of 54 multi-segment (L1-Sacrum) lumbar spine specimens were calculated to discover if such an underlying relationship exists with degeneration assessed using the Pfirrmann grading system. Further analyses were also conducted to determine if kinematic outcomes were affected by motion segment level, gender or applied compressive preload. Range of motion, hysteresis, high flexibility zone size and rotational stiffness in flexion-extension, lateral bending and axial rotation were the kinematic outcomes. Caudal intervertebral discs in our study sample were more degenerative than cranial discs. L5-S1 discs had the largest flexion-extension range of motion (p<0.005) and L1-L2 discs the lowest flexion high flexibility zone size (p<0.013). No other strict cranial-caudal differences in kinematic outcomes were found. Low flexibility zone rotational stiffness increased with disc degeneration grade in extension, lateral bending and axial rotation (p<0.001). Trends towards higher hysteresis and lower range of motion with increased degeneration were observed in flexion-extension and lateral bending. Applied compressive preload increased flexion-extension hysteresis and augmented the effect of degeneration on hysteresis (p<0.0005). Female specimens had about one degree larger range of motion in all rotational modes, and higher flexion extension hysteresis (p=0.016). These results suggest that gender differences exist in lumbar spine kinematics. Additionally high disc loads, applied compressive preload or applied moment, are needed to kinematically distinguish discs with different levels of degeneration.Copyright © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

2817,"Decline of natural killer cell activity in sublethally irradiated mice. Spleen cells of (C57BL/6 X C3H/He)F1 mice were assayed for natural killer (NK) cell activity against YAC-1 and FBL-3 lymphoma targets at several intervals after total-body exposure to a high sublethal dose of 137Cs or 60Co gamma-rays. NK cell activity did not decline for the first 12 days but decreased sharply thereafter and remained low until day 24. The recovery of splenic NK cell activity was delayed. Beginning on day 28, the activity was slowly increased, reaching near-normal levels (80% of controls) 41-59 days after irradiation. Suppressor cells detectable during the period of lowest NK cell activity, i.e., on days 17 and 19, may have been responsible for the delayed and slow recovery. These studies indicated that a) mature effectors of natural cytotoxicity are relatively radioresistant renewable cells with a lifespan of about 2 weeks whose progenitors are radiosensitive cells b) the kinetics of decline and especially of recovery of NK cell activity may be influenced by suppressor cells. Should NK cell activity confer resistance to autochthonous lymphomas in vivo, it may be a significant consideration for strategies of tumor therapy by cytotoxic agents that reconstitution of the NK cell pool is a slow process and that suppressor cell function must be overcome for full recovery.",Included,0.97075415

2819,"Submandibular function recovery after IMRT in head and neck cancer: A prospective dose modelling study. Purpose: To estimate the dose response relationship for submandibular gland (SMG) recovery using salivary scintigraphy in patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer treated with curative image guided chemoradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Ninety newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients (T1-3, N0-2c, M0) treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy on a prospective clinical trial were assessed for salivary toxicity at predefined intervals using dynamic salivary scintigraphy. The SMG function was measured using salivary excretion fraction (SEF) ratios at baseline and 6 monthly. Tolerance dose (TD) 50 for submandibular gland was estimated from dose response curves. Result(s): The mean SEF ratio of 180 SMGs decreased at 6 months with a nadir at 12 months after treatment (SEF ratio 15%) and progressively recovered over time reaching 38% over 24 months. There was significant inverse correlation between SEF ratio and mean SMG dose at 6 months (r = -0.18, p = 0.04); 12-months (r = -0.36, p < 0.001); 18-months (r = -0.48, p < 0.001); 24-months (r = -0.42, p < 0.001); and more than 24-months (r = -0.56, p < 0.001). The estimated TD 50 values at 1 year and 2 year post treatment were 36 Gy and 44 Gy respectively with SEF ratio of <=45% used to define severe xerostomia. For every 1 Gy reduction in mean dose below 54 Gy, there is 2-2.5% reduction in the probability of severe xerostomia. Conclusion(s): The submandibular gland function declines after radiotherapy with a nadir at 12 months and there is incomplete recovery over time with continued improvement over 24 months. The TD 50 at 1 year and 2 year was 36 Gy and 44 Gy with a 2-2.5% reduction in the probability of severe xerostomia for every 1 Gy reduction in mean dose.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.03918116
2820,"A randomized study comparing the use of a pelvic lead shield during trans-radial interventions: Threefold decrease in radiation to the operator but double exposure to the patient. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of a 0.5-mm lead apron across the patient's abdomen in addition to standard operator protection for the reduction of scatter radiation on operator and patient radiation exposure, BACKGROUND: Cardiac angiography using the radial access compared to the femoral approach is associated with reduced complication rate and improved patient comfort but has significantly increased radiation dose. Improvements in radiation protection are needed, METHODS: We randomly assigned 332 patients undergoing coronary angiography to a group with pelvic lead shielding and a group with standard protection. In each procedure, eight digital dosimeters were used to measure operator radiation dose [under the lead apron, outside the thyroid shield, and at the left side of the head], patient dose at the level of the umbilicus [above and beneath the lead apron], and two on the acrylic shielding and one on the image receptor to measure scattered radiation, RESULTS: Both groups were similar in BMI, procedures performed, and number of sequences. Usage of lead shielding statistically significantly reduced the radiation dose of the operator at all three sites measured: under lead apron [all in microSv]: 0.53 +/- 1.4 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.6, on thyroid collar 5.9 +/- 7.7 vs. 2.9 +/- 3.4, and left side of head 3.3 +/- 3.4 vs. 2.1 +/- 2.2, P<0.001. However the radiation to the patient was doubled from 15.4 +/- 24.1 to 28.9 +/- 81.1, P=0.04 CONCLUSIONS: The use of a pelvic lead shield during radial angiography reduced the operator radiation exposure at multiple measurement sites. However there was an increased exposure to the patient. This balance should be further investigated before the widespread adoption of this method. .

2821,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy of rectal carcinoma: Baseline hematologic parameters influencing outcomes. Background: The link between the blood count and a systemic inflammatory response (SIR) is indisputable and well described. Pretreatment hematological parameters may predict the overall clinical outcomes in many types of cancer. Thus, this study aims to systematically evaluate the relationship between baseline blood count levels and treatment response in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients and Methods: From 2009-2015, 173 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were retrospectively enrolled in the study and analyzed. The baseline blood count was recorded in all patients 1 week before chemoradiation. Tumor response was evaluated through pathologic findings. Blood count levels which included RBC (red blood cells), Hb (hemoglobin), PLT (platelet count), neutrophil count, WBC (white blood cells), NLR (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), and PLR (platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio) were analyzed in relation to tumor downstaging, pCR (pathologic complete response), OS (overall survival), and DFS (disease-free survival). Result(s): Hb levels were associated with a response in logistic regression analysis: pCR (p = 0.05; OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.00-1.07); T downstaging (p = 0.006; OR 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01-1.05); N downstaging (p = 0.09; OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00-1.04); T or N downstaging (p = 0.007; OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07); T and N downstaging (p = 0.02; OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00-1.04); Hb and RBC were the most significant parameters influencing OS; PLT was a negative prognostic factor for OS and DFS (p = 0.008 for OS); an NLR value of 2.8 was associated with the greatest significance for OS (p = 0.03) and primary tumor downstaging (p = 0.02).

2822,"Dual-energy CT angiography for assessment of regional pulmonary perfusion in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: Initial experience. OBJECTIVE. This study assessed the utility of dual-energy pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) for noninvasive assessment of regional pulmonary perfusion in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Regional perfusion abnormalities were correlated with hemodynamic parameters and structural abnormalities on pulmonary CTA. SUBJECTS and methods. Twenty patients with CTEPH (11 men and nine women; mean age, 61.5 years) underwent pulmonary CTA with a dual-energy technique. Right heart catheterization data were available in 15 cases. Scan parameters were as follows: tube A, 140 kV (75 mA); tube B, 80 kV (300 mA); gantry rotation, 500 milliseconds; pitch, 0.5; and collimation, 14 x 1.2 mm. An iodine map was generated via three-material- decomposition and was scored for extent of hypoperfusion. Correlation was made with mosaic attenuation pattern, extent of vascular obstruction, and right heart hemodynamics. Iodine attenuation values were analyzed within completely occluded, partially occluded, and disease-free lobes. Results . A strong correlation existed between dual-energy CT-derived perfusion and mosaic attenuation pattern when both lobar (r > 0.6; n = 20; p < 0.006) and whole-lung scores were assessed (r = 0.77; n = 20; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant correlation between dual-energy CT perfusion and vascular obstructive index, mean pulmonary artery pressure, or pulmonary vascular resistance (p > 0.08). Of 42 completely occluded lobes, 27 (64%) had demonstrable residual perfusion (mismatching), suggesting that blood supply was maintained via systemic collaterals. Conclusion. Dual-energy CT can offer a ""one-stop"" assessment of anatomy and perfusion in CTEPH. The additional information provided by dual-energy CT could have a future role in helping guide patient selection for thromboendarterectomy surgery. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded,0.038478713
2823,"Coronary CT angiography performed by the novel whole organ volumetric high definition CT scanner in patients with atrial fibrillation. Objectives: To evaluate the image quality, coronary interpretability and radiation exposure of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) performed with a newest generation of cardiac-CT scanner in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Background(s): Despite the relevant improvement in the CT temporal resolution that characterizes the last scanner generation, the evaluation of coronary arteries by CCTA in patients with AF remains the more challenging application of cardiac- CT, particularly in patients with heart rate (HR) >75 bpm. Moreover, the radiation exposure associated with CT is still very high in this clinical subset. Material(s) and Method(s): 49 patients (30 males, mean age 71,5+/-7,3 years old) with chronic AF undergoing CCTA for suspected CAD by using a novel whole organ volumetric high definition CT scanner (16cm z-axis coverage with 256 detector rows and 512 slices, gantry rotation time 0.28 sec), were enrolled in the study. Prospective ECG-triggering was used in all patients, of whom 20 with double-shot technique and the remaining 29 with single-shot technique. In all patients, image quality score (by a 4-point Likert scale on a per-segment level) and coronary interpretability were evaluated and the effective dose (ED) was recorded. Result(s): The mean HR during the scan was 87.7+/-22 bpm. The overall image quality was very high (Likert=3.4+/-1.2, excellent image quality=451 segments, good=206 segments, adequate=90 segments, poor/non diagnostic=19 segments). The overall coronary interpretability was 97.5% (747/766 segments); in patients performed with double-shot technique, the interpretability was 96.4%, whereas we found an interpretability of 98.4% with single-shot technique. The overall mean ED was 4.6+/-2.1 mSv, while a significantly lower dose (3.6+/-1.5 mSv) was measured for single-shot technique vs. double-shot approach (5.9+/-2.1 mSv, p<0.01).

Rationale and Objectives: To evaluate image quality, coronary interpretability and radiation exposure of coronary CT angiography (CCTA)performed in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)with the latest scanner generation, comparing two different technical approaches. A new scanner that combines a 0.23 mm spatial resolution, a new generation of iterative reconstruction, fast gantry rotation time and the intracycle motion-correction algorithm to improve the temporal resolution was recently introduced in the clinical field. Material(s) and Method(s): We enrolled 105 consecutive patients with chronic AF who performed CCTA with a whole-heart coverage high-definition CT scanner (16-cm z-axis coverage with 256 detector rows, 0.28 s gantry rotation time). Five of them were excluded for impaired renal function. Patients were randomized between a double acquisition protocol (50 patients, group 1)or a single acquisition protocol (50 patients, group 2). The image quality, coronary segment interpretability and effective dose (ED)of CCTA were assessed. Result(s): The mean HR during the scan was 85.6+/-21 bpm in group 1 vs. 83.7+/-23 bpm in Group 2, respectively (p < ns). In group 2, overall image quality was high and comparable with that of group 1 (Likert scale =3.2 +/- 1.4 vs. 3.3 +/- 1.2, p = ns, in group 1 and 2, respectively). Coronary interpretability was high and similar between the two groups (97.5% and 97.1% in group 1 and 2, p = ns, respectively). Mean ED was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (5.3 +/- 1.8 mSv vs. 2.7 +/- 0.7 mSv, p < 0.001).

2825,"Radiofrequency ablation is beneficial in simultaneous treatment of synchronous liver metastases and primary colorectal cancer. Background: In patients with resectable synchronous colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), either twostaged or simultaneous resections of the primary tumor and liver metastases are performed. Data on radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of CRLM during a simultaneous procedure is lacking. The primary aim was to analyze short-term and long-term outcome of RFA in simultaneous treatment. A secondary aim was to compare simultaneous resection with the colorectal-first approach. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of 241 patients with colorectal cancer and synchronous CRLM between 2000-2016. Median follow-up was 36.1 months (IQR 18.2-58.8 months). A multivariable analysis was performed to analyze the postoperative morbidity, using the comprehensive complication index. A propensity matched analysis was performed to compare survival rates. Result(s): In multivariable analysis, the best predictor of lower complication severity was treatment with RFA (p = 0.040). Higher complication rates were encountered in patients who underwent an abdominoperineal resection (p = 0.027) or age > 60 years (p = 0.022). The matched analysis showed comparable overall survival in RFA treated patients versus patients undergoing a liver resection with a five year overall survival of 39.4% and 37.5%, respectively (p = 0.782). In a second matched analysis, 5-year overall survival rates in simultaneously treated patients (43.8%) was comparable to patients undergoing the colorectal first approach (43.0%, p = 0.223). Conclusion(s): RFA treatment of CRLM in simultaneous procedures is associated with a lower complication severity and non-inferior oncological outcome as compared to partial liver resection. RFA should be considered a useful alternative to liver resection.Copyright © 2018 Hof et al.

2826,"Irradiation of adult human dental pulp stem cells provokes activation of p53, cell cycle arrest, and senescence but not apoptosis. Adult human dental pulp contains stem cells (DPSCs) that are capable of differentiation into osteoblasts, odontoblasts, adipocytes, and neuronal-like cells. Because these cells have potential use in tissue regeneration, herein we characterized the response of DPSC lines to ionizing radiation (IR). These DPSC lines have been developed from the extracted molars of healthy donors. DPSCs were cultivated in a unique media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Since tissue homeostasis depends on a precise balance among cell proliferation, senescence, and cell death, we explored the effects of IR (2-20 Gy) on the proliferative activity of DPSCs and the molecular pathways involved. Even the highest dose used (20 Gy) did not induce DPSC apoptosis. After irradiation with doses of 6 and 20 Gy, DPSCs accumulated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. DPSCs responded to IR (20 Gy) with senescence detected as SA-beta-galactosidase positivity, beginning on the third day after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, p53 and its serine 15 and 392 phosphorylated forms were detected. At this time, p21 (WAF1) was induced. Increases in protein p16 were observed from the third day following irradiation and continued till the end of the examination (Day 13). We conclude that DPSCs respond to IR-induced damage by permanent cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and by stress-induced premature senescence. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Included,0.97076875

Twenty-eight patients (13 males and 15 females; mean age, 34 years; [age range, 15-51 years]) most with extensive generalized vitiligo of more than 6 months duration had received KUVA at sometime during a 14-year period. The response to treatment (i.e. repigmentation of depigmented areas) was rated retrospectively comparing photographs taken before and after therapy and correlation analysis revealed that it was statistically significantly linked to the number of KUVA treatments (r = 0.833, P = 0.001) and to total cumulative UVA dose (r = 0.840, P = 0.001). Of 17 patients who had continued therapy for longer than 3 months, 7 (41%) had a good response (i.e., more than 70% repigmentation of lesional skin) after a mean of 194 treatments (range, 69-386 treatments) and a mean cumulative UVA dose of 2,036 J/cm2 (range, 690-4,411 J/cm2), whereas lower response grades were observed in the patients with lower treatment numbers.

2828,"Hypothesis testing, statistical power, and confidence limits in the presence of epistemic uncertainty. Hypothesis testing, statistical power, and confidence limits are concepts from classical statistics that require data from observations. In some important recent applications some of the data are not observational but are reconstructed by computer models. There is generally epistemic uncertainty in model formulations, as well as in parameter and input values. The resulting epistemic uncertainty of the reconstructed data is determined by an uncertainty analysis and is expressed by subjective probability distributions. Sometimes only the mean or median values of the distributions are used in the concepts mentioned above, which hides the uncertainty of the data thereby rendering misleading results. Misleading results are also obtained if the epistemic uncertainty of the data is combined incorrectly with the stochastic variability of the outcome of the actual random complex concerned. This paper argues that an uncertainty analysis of the application of classical statistical concepts is essentially the correct way of dealing with the epistemic uncertainty of the data. A practical example serves as an illustration.",Excluded,0.03866583
2829,"Constraining the brachial plexus does not compromise regional control in oropharyngeal carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that brachial plexopathy following head and neck cancer radiotherapy may be underreported and that this toxicity is associated with a dose-response. Our purpose was to determine whether the dose to the brachial plexus (BP) can be constrained, without compromising regional control., METHODS: The radiation plans of 324 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) were reviewed. We identified 42 patients (13%) with gross nodal disease <1 cm from the BP. Normal tissue constraints included a maximum dose of 66 Gy and a D05 of 60 Gy for the BP. These criteria took precedence over planning target volume (PTV) coverage of nodal disease near the BP., RESULTS: There was only one regional failure in the vicinity of the BP, salvaged with neck dissection (ND) and regional re-irradiation. There have been no reported episodes of brachial plexopathy to date., CONCLUSIONS: In combined-modality therapy, including ND as salvage, regional control did not appear to be compromised by constraining the dose to the BP. This approach may improve the therapeutic ratio by reducing the long-term risk of brachial plexopathy.",Excluded,0.0389591
2830,"Ultrasonic backscatter difference measurements of cancellous bone from the human femur: Relation to bone mineral density and microstructure. Ultrasonic backscatter techniques are being developed to detect changes in cancellous bone caused by osteoporosis. One technique, called the backscatter difference technique, measures the power difference between two portions of a backscatter signal. The goal of the present study is to investigate how bone mineral density (BMD) and the microstructure of human cancellous bone influence four backscatter difference parameters: the normalized mean of the backscatter difference (nMBD) spectrum, the normalized slope of the backscatter difference spectrum, the normalized intercept of the backscatter difference spectrum, and the normalized backscatter amplitude ratio (nBAR). Ultrasonic measurements were performed with a 3.5MHz broadband transducer on 54 specimens of human cancellous bone from the proximal femur. Volumetric BMD and the microstructural characteristics of the specimens were measured using x-ray micro-computed tomography. Of the four ultrasonic parameters studied, nMBD and nBAR demonstrated the strongest univariate correlations with density and microstructure. Multivariate analyses indicated that nMBD and nBAR depended on trabecular separation and possibly other microstructural characteristics of the specimens independently of BMD. These findings suggest that nMBD and nBAR may be sensitive to changes in the density and microstructure of bone caused by osteoporosis.",Excluded,0.039413225
2831,"Development of Simple Methods to Reduce the Exposure of the Public to Radiation from Patients Who Have Undergone 18F-FDG PET/CT. At a time when reducing the radiation dose to patients and the public has become a major focus, we assessed the radiation exposure rate from patients after an 18F-FDG PET/CT scan and evaluated different interventions to reduce it. Methods: We enrolled 100 patients, divided into 2 groups. For both groups, the radiation dose rate was measured with an ionization survey meter immediately after the scan. For group 1, the patients then voided and their dose rate was measured again. For group 2, the patients waited 30 min before voiding, and we measured the dose rate before (group 2A) and after (group 2B) they voided. Results: In total, 74 of the 100 patients exceeded the 20 muSv/h (2 mR/h) threshold immediately after the scan. In group 1, the mean dose rate decreased by 20.0% from the postscan measurement, with 12 of 36 remaining at or above 20 muSv/h. In group 2A, the mean dose rate decreased by 23% from the postscan measurement, with 9 of 38 remaining at or above 20 muSv/h. In group 2B, the mean dose rate decreased by 35% from the postscan measurement, with 1 of 38 remaining at 20 muSv/h. Conclusion: Nearly 75% of patients undergoing an 18F-FDG PET/CT scan exceed 20 muSv/h when leaving the imaging facility. The most effective method to reduce radiation exposure was to have the patient void 30 min after the examination.

2832,"Hippocampal sparing radiotherapy for glioblastoma patients: A planning study using volumetric modulated arc therapy. Background: The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential to reduce exposure of the contralateral hippocampus in radiotherapy for glioblastoma using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Method(s): Datasets of 27 patients who had received 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for glioblastoma with a prescribed dose of 60Gy in fractions of 2Gy were included in this planning study. VMAT plans were optimized with the aim to reduce the dose to the contralateral hippocampus as much as possible without compromising other parameters. Hippocampal dose and treatment parameters were compared to the 3D-CRT plans using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The influence of tumour location and PTV size on the hippocampal dose was investigated with the Mann-Whitney-U-test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Result(s): The median reduction of the contralateral hippocampus generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) with VMAT was 36 % compared to the original 3D-CRT plans (p<0.05). Other dose parameters were maintained or improved. The median V30Gy brain could be reduced by 17.9 % (p<0.05). For VMAT, a parietal and a non-temporal tumour localisation as well as a larger PTV size were predictors for a higher hippocampal dose (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): Using VMAT, a substantial reduction of the radiotherapy dose to the contralateral hippocampus for patients with glioblastoma is feasible without compromising other treatment parameters. For larger PTV sizes, less sparing can be achieved. Whether this approach is able to preserve the neurocognitive status without compromising the oncological outcome needs to be investigated in the setting of prospective clinical trials.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).",Excluded,0.038191337
2833,"A single-center pilot study for radiosensitization of everolimus with external beam radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic neuroendocrine liver metastasis. Background: Liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors (NELM) are common. Given the benefit of everolimus (E) in patients with neuroendocrine tumors and its additive effect to radiotherapy (RT) in other histologies, this study evaluated safety and efficacy of concurrent E with RT for NELM. Method(s): Prospective study of 14 patients with <4 NELM, progressing on standard therapy, treated with E for 28 days prior to, concurrent with, and 14 days following RT. A safety run-in of 2 patients at E 2.5 mg daily, then 5 mg daily were completed prior to treating 10 patients with 7.5 mg daily. RTwas delivered using either conventional radiation (cRT) 30 Gy in 10 fractions or stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) 35-60 Gy in 3-5 fractions. Per lesion response was evaluated per RECIST v1.1, and toxicity per the CTCAE v4.03. Result(s): 40 NELM were treated in 14 patients (7 male and 7 female), with a median age of 63 (47-88). Primaries included lung (4), small bowel (6), colorectal (3) and renal (1); Gr.I/typical lung (4) and Gr.II/atypical lung (10). Median radiation dose delivered (BED10) was 72 Gy (range 39-180). The overall response rate (ORR) was 33%; no patients developed progression at a treated NELM in the 12 month follow-up period. Median change in size per metastasis was -23%(-100% to 7%). 1 patient developed pseudoprogression. Median time to best response was 9 months. One patient at the 7.5mg dose discontinued E post-RT due to Grade 2 thrombocytopenia, and one patient at the 7.5 mg dose had Grade 3 hypertension which resolved after completing E. Conclusion(s): Concurrent E and liver RT is safe. No patients developed progression of their treated NELM in the 12 months post treatment; further follow-up is required to determine long-term control. Combination E and RT may be an option for patients with low-volume NELM; further investigation is warranted for this promising approach.",Excluded,0.038300596
2834,"Unusual presentation of gouty arthrittis. Case Presentation: Gout is a crystalline arthropathy characterized by the deposition of urate crystals in joints. Typically, it involves the first metatarsophalangeal joint (podagra), ankle, or knee joint, although other joints may be affected. Gout presents as an acute mono- or oligoarticular arthritis with warm, tense, dusky red overlying skin. Increased serum uric acid may be seen in 70% cases of acute gout. Gout occurs in men and postmenopausal women, and risk factors include diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, increased purine intake, alcohol, diuretic therapy, land ow-dose aspirin. Definitive diagnosis is made through arthrocentesis with polarized microscopic examination of the synovial fluid showing intracellular or extracellular needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals. Discussion(s): A 61-year-old postmenopausal female with a history of moderate L4-L5 central spinal canal stenosis and hypertension, presented with 3 weeks of severe right lower-extremity pain, felt over the right hip, radiating to the right leg, and worsened on weight bearing. Multiple prior evaluations in the emergency room for these symptoms revealed unremarkable x-rays of the back, hips, and pelvis. Treatment with opiates and NSAIDs was ineffective. The patient was able to recall an isolated episode of possible podagra more than 10 years prior to her current events. On examination, flexion and extension of the right hip elicited slight tenderness, and point tenderness was noted over the right sacroiliac joint. A right knee effusion was detected. Laboratory examination was remarkable for a normal CBC and CMP, and her ESR (55 mm/Hg) and CRP (39 mg/L) were elevated along with a high serum uric acid level (10 mg/dL). On further investigation, MRI imaging revealed right-sided sacroiliitis along with edema in the iliopsoas region. CT-guided joint aspiration revealed large amounts of intra- and extracellular, negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals along with prominent tophaceous formations. Infection was excluded. Diagnosis of chronic tophaceous gout with acute gouty sacroiliitis and a possible component of crystalline iliopsoas tendonitis was made. Patient refused intra-articular steroid injection and was treated with systemic glucocorticoids. Uric acid-lowering therapy with allopurinol was started on outpatient follow-up. Conclusion(s): Characteristically, gout affects peripheral joints, and axial involvement is considered infrequent. Literature on axial gout is limited to case reports and case series. Reports suggest that axial radiographic involvement in gout is frequently underrecognized, as it may remain subclinical. Patients with acute gouty sacroiliitis may present with pain referred to the thigh, hip, or back, and crystalline iliopsoas tendonitis may further restrict hip movement, as seen in our case. Acute gouty arthritis should be considered in patients presenting with sacroiliac joint pain, particularly if they have a history of gout or risk factors for this form of rheumatism.",Excluded,0.03830791
2835,"[Hard x-ray therapy with special reference to postoperative irradiation of breast carcinoma]. Five-year-experiences have shown that a considerably intensified tolerance of the skin and an absorption equability of tissues and bones and muscles are obtained with the hard ray roentgen irradiator, RT 305, for half-value depths from 20 mm to 70 mm H-2O and half-value thickness to about 7 mm Cu. By means of a rod anode tube of 300 kV with a super-normal filtration to 3.5 mm Pb, a hard and nearly monochromatic radiation, which already possesses the above mentioned advantages of the ultra-hard ray therapy with an effective energy about 0.2 MeV, appears. The application of this hard ray therapy is given preferably for disease foci in the environment of bone tissues, i.e. in the head and throat, the vertebral column, the osseous pelvic ring and the extremities and as the conventional roentgen therapy ist not able to give it. The hard ray therapy seems to be particularly adapted for the postoperative irradiation of the cancer of the breast with the ribs lying in the region of the irradiation fields, with the sternum and the bones of the shoulder girdle.

2836,"Influence of cartilage lesions in the lateral compartment on clinical outcome following medial openwedge osteotomy. Objectives: High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is an established treatment method for cartilage damage of the medial compartment with concurrent varus deformity. The influence of lateral compartment cartilage lesions on the final clinical outcome remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of those lesions on the functional outcome in patients suffering from cartilage damage of the medial compartment and undergoing a valgus high tibial osteotomy. Method(s): From January 2005 to December 2013, there were 156 patients, suffering from cartilage damage of the medial compartment and an underlying varus deformity, who were treated by a biplane HTO. In all of the cases, a preoperative diagnostic arthroscopy was performed, and the presence of underlying cartilage lesions of the lateral compartment (LC) was assessed and evaluated using the ICRS classification. Preoperatively, the Lysholm score, pain levels (VAS) as well as the presence of pain in the lateral compartment were recorded. Clinical outcome parameters were raised at final follow-up (post-OP: VAS, Lysholm, KOOS, IKDC, WOMAC). Analysis of the pre-and post-operatively recorded X-Rays was performed by means of using a planning software (mediCAD\, Hectec GmbH, Germany), as well as a statistical analysis was carried out with the aid of SPSS Statistics 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, USA.) software. A p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): 37 patients (= 24%) had noticed pain in the LC before the day of surgery. 76. 3% (n = 119, group A) of the patients had no cartilage damage of the LC, 10.3% (n = 16) had a single lesion of the lateral tibial plateau or femoral condyle (group B), 13.4% (n = 21) had corresponding lesions of the LC (group C). Preoperatively, there were no differences between the groups concerning mean follow-up, BMI, the Lysholm score or VAS score (p > 0.05). Differences could be found concerning patient age (group A, B > group C; p > 0.001) and preoperative varus deformity (group A < group B,C; p < 0.003). In all patients, HTO was planed aiming for a comparable mild postoperative valgus alignment (p = 0.53). With regard to clinical outcome parameters, group A had the best results reaching statistical significance in the final WOMACpain score (p = 0.032) and WOMACfunction score (p = 0.049). ICRS score of the LC cartilage lesions correlated significantly with WOMACpain and the WOMACfunction. Nonetheless, all of the groups A to C showed a significant increase in the Lysholm score (p< 0.001) and decrease in pain level (VAS score) at final follow up (p < 0.001). Preoperative patient selection prior to the performance of a valgus high tibial osteotomy is of major importance. Presence of cartilage damage of the lateral compartment is adversely influencing final clinical outcome and has to be seen as a relative contraindication for valgus high tibial osteotomy. Nonetheless, even in those patients a significant improvement of functional parameters and decrease of pain levels can be observed.",Excluded,0.038174737
2837,"Mandibulotomy: an analysis of its morbidities. The mandibulotomy is a procedure that was developed to improve access in tumour resection. This study aimed to investigate the complications associated with mandibulotomy and analyze factors that could affect the risks of developing these complications. The hospital records of all patients who underwent a mandibulotomy as part of their tumour ablative surgery at two major centres in Malaysia were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic, clinical, and complications data were recorded and analyzed. Early postoperative complications occurred in 46.5% of the patients and post-radiation therapy complications in 16.1%. Wound dehiscence (27.9%) and inferior alveolar nerve injury (25.6%) were the common early postoperative complications. Dental injuries (9.7%) and plate exposure/infection (9.7%) were the common post-radiation therapy complications. Furthermore, inferior alveolar nerve injury and early abscess formation were significantly associated with the site of the mandibulotomy. The T-stage of a tumour but not the site of mandibulotomy was significantly associated with tumour margin clearance. Mandibulotomy does pose an added risk of complications for a patient undergoing tumour surgery. The benefits of mandibulotomy in terms of gaining margin clearance could not be proven in this study. The site of mandibulotomy appears to increase the risk of developing an inferior alveolar nerve injury.Copyright © 2019",Excluded,0.039975837
2838,"Physiological, behavioral, and serological responses of horses to shaded or unshaded pens in a hot, sunny environment. Housing recommendations for horses invariably include providing access to shade on hot, sunny days, but the potential benefits have not been scientifically studied. This experiment measured physiological, behavioral, and serological responses of horses confined individually to completely shaded (SH) or completely unshaded (SUN) drylot pens during the summer in Davis, CA. Twelve healthy adult horses in a crossover design experienced both treatments for 5 d each. Rectal temperature, respiration rate, skin temperature, and sweat scores were recorded hourly from 1230 to 1730 h daily. Observations were recorded from 1200 to 1800 h for proximity to water, foraging, locomotion, and insect avoidance behaviors. Daily blood samples were obtained to measure cortisol, hematocrit, and neutrophil- to-lymphocyte ratio. Automated and handheld sensors were used to record environmental conditions. The mean ambient temperature from 1200 to 1800 h during the study was 30.6degreeC. Rectal temperature was greater for horses in SUN than for SH (mean 37.8degreeC and 37.5degreeC, respectively, SE = 0.06, P = 0.002) as was respiration rate (25.5 and 20.5 breaths/min, SE = 1.3, P = 0.008), and skin temperature (35.6degreeC and 34.6degreeC, SE = 0.1, P < 0.001). Horses in SUN showed sweat in 51.4% of observations vs. 1.1% for horses in SH. Horses in SUN spent more time than SH horses standing near their water source (34.0% of observations vs. 20.2%, SE = 0.3, P = 0.004). No differences were observed for foraging, locomotion, or insect avoidance behavior (P > 0.05). Cortisol concentrations were greater in SUN than SH (3.4 and 2.6 mug/dL, respectively, P < 0.001) but remained within the normal range for resting horses. No treatment differences were observed for hematocrit or neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P > 0.05). Horses exhibited treatment differences in the physiological measures first, most notably in rectal temperature at 1230 h, corresponding to peak solar radiation. Behavioral responses followed these physiological changes, with treatment differences in time standing near water becoming apparent at 1400 h as ambient and black globe temperature increased. Our results indicate that both the SH and SUN treatment groups exhibited thermoregulatory responses to these summer conditions and horses benefited from shade, as it mitigated these physiological and behavioral changes. These results are applicable in developing best management practices for the care of domestic horses. © 2013 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.038566332

Objective: To assess the yield of non-contrast enhanced CT (CT KUB) across different ordering specialties and need of developing an algorithm for its rationale use. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 1550 consecutive CT KUB studies requested for suspected renal colic carried out at a single institution in a calendar year. The data was analyzed for demographic characteristics, referring clinician and final diagnosis. Only patients with CT as primary imaging for clinically suspected reno-ureteral colic were included. Departments ordering these CT KUB examinations were divided into three divisions: Urologist, emergency room (ER) physician and others. Result(s): Of 1550 CT KUB performed in the study period 766 met the inclusion criteria. Urologists (57%), followed by ER physicians (30%) mostly ordered the examination. The overall positive yield for urolithiasis was 64% (n = 490), rate of incidental/alternate findings was 15% (n = 116) and 21% (n = 160) were negative. Urologist has the highest positive yield of 67.4% (n = 295) followed by ER physician 67% (n = 152) and others 42.5% (n = 43); p < 0.001. Rate of incidental/alternate findings was highest in CT ordered by other specialties 23.7% (n = 24) followed by ER physician 17.6% (n = 40) and urologist 11.8% (n = 52); p = 0.005. Conclusion(s): There is statistically significant difference of yield across specialties. CT KUB as an initial imaging modality for suspected urolithiasis should be ordered in consultation with the urologist and ER physicians.

2841,"A CT-Based Automated Algorithm for Airway Segmentation Using Freeze-and-Grow Propagation and Deep Learning. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common lung disease, and quantitative CT-based bronchial phenotypes are of increasing interest as a means of exploring COPD sub-phenotypes, establishing disease progression, and evaluating intervention outcomes. Reliable, fully automated, and accurate segmentation of pulmonary airway trees is critical to such exploration. We present a novel approach of multi-parametric freeze-and-grow (FG) propagation which starts with a conservative segmentation parameter and captures finer details through iterative parameter relaxation. First, a CT intensity-based FG algorithm is developed and applied for airway tree segmentation. A more efficient version is produced using deep learning methods generating airway lumen likelihood maps from CT images, which are input to the FG algorithm. Both CT intensity- and deep learning-based algorithms are fully automated, and their performance, in terms of repeat scan reproducibility, accuracy, and leakages, is evaluated and compared with results from several state-of-the-art methods including an industry-standard one, where segmentation results were manually reviewed and corrected. Both new algorithms show a reproducibility of 95% or higher for total lung capacity (TLC) repeat CT scans. Experiments on TLC CT scans from different imaging sites at standard and low radiation dosages show that both new algorithms outperform the other methods in terms of leakages and branch-level accuracy. Considering the performance and execution times, the deep learning-based FG algorithm is a fully automated option for large multi-site studies.Copyright © 1982-2012 IEEE.",Excluded,0.038324032
2842,"Associations between urologist financial incentives and imaging use. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Diagnostic imaging use has risen over the last decade contributing to health care costs, as well as patient exposure to ionizing radiation. While studies have examined the role of patient factors in these imaging trends, little is known about how physician financial incentives influence imaging use. Motivated by this, we investigated associations between urologists' imaging use and factors on which their compensation is based. METHOD(S): We analyzed data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Through specialty codes, we identified those visits to urology clinics. Using explicit codes from the patient record form, we determined the proportion of urology visits at which imaging was ordered. During their induction interview, participating providers indicate if they are full-or part-owners, employees or independent contractors at the office location where they see the most ambulatory patients. Physicians are also asked if their clinical productivity, patient satisfaction or quality of care is taken into account for their compensation (e.g., bonuses). We performed multivariable regression to determine if a patient's receipt of imaging was associated with these financial incentives. RESULT(S): Between 2006 and 2007, over 37 million outpatient visits were made to urologists, during 22.4% (95% CI, 19.0-26.2%) of which imaging was ordered. Imaging was ordered at 24.2% (95% CI, 20.8 - 28.1%) of visits to owners, compared to 13.2% (95% CI, 9.2 - 18.6%) of visits to nonowners (P<0.001). Imaging was ordered at a higher proportion of visits to urologists with clinical productivity incentives vs. those without (27.3% [95% CI, 22.4 - 32.7%] vs. 20.8% [95% CI, 16.8 - 25.4%], P=0.049). The odds of having an imaging study ordered were 2-fold greater at an owner's office (p = 0.001). Visits to urologists with productivity incentives had a 43% higher odds of imaging (p = 0.05). These associations persisted after adjusting for patient characteristics (age, sex, race, comorbidity, urban/rural residence) and geographic region (Table). No association was found for financial incentives related to patient satisfaction or clinical quality. CONCLUSION(S): Independent of patient characteristics, imaging use at ambulatory urology visits is associated with provider financial incentives. (Table Presented).",Excluded,0.038567092
2843,"Targeted therapy for metastatic kidney cancer at a urologic outpatient clinic: Experience of partly nurse administrated treatment. Introduction and Objectives: Since 2006 patients from Gothenburg with metastatic kidney cancer have been treated with targeted therapy at the outpatient clinic of the Urologic department, Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Therapy was started by a senior urologist and thereafter administrated by two specialized nurses conducting frequent visits for handing out medicine, blood checks, weight and blood pressure controls, patient education and tending of side effects. The responsible doctor was contacted when adjustment of the treatment was needed. All medicine was handed to the patients to ensure that a minimum of the drugs were wasted. Visits to the doctors were conducted every 4th to 6th month mostly at the time of X-ray or when needed. The objective of the study was to report our experience with targeted therapy at a urologic outpatient clinic performed as partly nurse administered. Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2006 and 2012, 82 patients in total were treated with targeted therapy and registered in a database. All treatment and survival data were recorded. There were 56 men and 26 women. Result(s): Eighty-two patients were treated in first line. Treatment time on targeted therapy ranged from 9 days to 3 years and 10 months (median 11.5 months). In the first line 58 (71%) of the patients had sunitinib, 13 (16%) sorafenib, 7 (8%) bevacizumab+interferon, 3 (4%) pazopanib and 1 (1%) had temsirolimus. Thirty-four treatments were started in the second line. Ten treatments were given in the third and 2 in the fourth line. In 2012 33 patients were treated. During that year 213 visits were conducted by the specialized nurses and 54 visits by a senior urologist. Conclusion(s): A partly nurse administrated outpatient treatment with targeted therapy is possible when performed in close contact with the responsible doctor. It makes it possible to follow up the patients with short intervals and provides a close contact which they can always turn to with the numerous problems these patients have without consuming too much of doctor time.",Excluded,0.038184613

2845,"Identifying the mesenchymal molecular subtype of glioblastoma using quantitative volumetric analysis of anatomic magnetic resonance images. BackgroundSubtypes of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) based on genetic and molecular alterations are thought to cause alterations in anatomic MRI owing to downstream biological changes, such as edema production, blood-brain barrier breakdown, and necrosis. The purpose of the current study was to identify a potential relationship between imaging features and the mesenchymal (MES) GBM subtype, which has the worst patient prognosis.MethodsMRIs from 46 patients with histologically confirmed GBM were retrospectively analyzed. The volume of contrast enhancement, regions of central necrosis, and hyperintensity of T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) were measured. Additionally, the ratio of T2/FLAIR hyperintense volume to the volume of contrast enhancement and necrosis was calculated.ResultsThe volume of contrast enhancement, volume of central necrosis, combined volume of contrast enhancement and central necrosis, and the ratio of T2/FLAIR to contrast enhancement and necrosis were significantly different in MES compared with non-MES GBM (Mann-Whitney, P <. 05). Receiver-operator characteristics indicated that these 4 metrics were all significant predictors of the MES phenotype. The volume ratio of T2 hyperintensity to contrast enhancement and central necrosis was significantly lower in MES vs non-MES GBM (P <. 0001), was a significant predictor of the MES phenotype (area under the curve = 0.93, P <. 001), and could be used to stratify short- and long-term overall survival (log-rank, P =. 0064 using cutoff of 3.0). These trends were also present when excluding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutant tumors and incorporating covariates such as age and KPS score.ConclusionsResults suggest that volume ratio may be a simple, cost-effective, and noninvasive biomarker for quickly identifying MES GBM. © 2013 © The Author(s).",Excluded,0.038778957

2847,"Radioimmunoguided-intraoperative radiation therapy in colorectal carcinoma: A new technique to precisely define the clinical target volume. Purpose: The clinical target volume (CTV) to be irradiated by intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) after resection is generally based on the surgeon's estimation of close margins. We have developed a new technique, radioimmunoguided-intraoperative radiation therapy (RIG-IORT), that uses an intraoperative hand-held gamma-detecting probe to define areas of residual microscopic disease containing radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies to tumor associated antigen, to more precisely delineate the CTV for IORT. Methods and Materials: Patients were injected i.v. with 2 mCi 125I-radiolabeled CC49 antibody approximately 3 weeks before surgery. They then underwent radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) with maximal resection of tumor. A hand- held gamma-detecting probe (Neoprobe 1000) was used intraoperatively to detect and resect areas of high radioactivity, representing tumor. Areas with persistently high probe counts after resection were the areas of occult residual disease, and represented the CTV to be irradiated. The IORT was given with either 6-9 MeV electron beam from a dedicated linear accelerator, or with high-dose-rate brachytherapy from a remote afterloader. If all RIGS- positive tissue had been resected, or if widely disseminated disease remained, the patient was not considered for IORT. Result(s): This technique was used in 31 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma recurrent into the pelvis (n = 23) or paraortic nodes (n = 8). The CTV for IORT was delineated by increased RIGS count in 13 of 19 patients (68%) with microscopic residual, and in 11 of 12 patients (92%) with gross residual. In the other 7 patients, the tumor area did not accumulate the radiolabeled antibody; therefore, these tumor beds were irradiated based on the surgeon's estimation of close margins. Hence, overall, the RIG-IORT technique was used to define the tumor bed for IORT in 24 of 31 patients (77%). This technical report focuses on the development of the RIG-IORT technique and does not address the outcome results of the treated patients. Conclusion(s): A new technique, RIG-IORT, which uses radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies to precisely determine the CTV for IORT, is described. Whether the use of this technique will lead to improved tumor control will only be known upon the outcome analysis of RIG-IORT- treated patients compared with those obtained using traditional IORT techniques.",Excluded,0.039275497
2848,"Quality of life of nasopharyngeal cancer survivors in China. Purpose We assessed the quality of life (qol) of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc) survivors with a survival time of more than 2 years in Fujian, China, and we analyzed factors influencing qol. Methods We calculated the prevalence of psychological distress and radiotherapy (rt)-induced symptoms in 216 npc survivors who participated in a cross-sectional survey. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (version 3.0) was used to assess the qol of npc survivors. Multiple linear regression was applied to analyze the factors influencing qol. Results The prevalence rates of rt-induced symptoms and psychological problems were 11.58% (95% ci: 7.21% to 15.58%) for difficulty in swallowing, 17.59% (95% ci: 12.51% to 22.67%) for mouth dryness or sores, 13.89% (95% ci: 9.28% to 18.50%) for nasal dryness or congestion, 18.52% (95% ci: 13.34% to 23.70%) for fatigue, 11.11% (95% ci: 6.92% to 15.30%) for frequent dizziness, 18.06% (95% ci: 12.93% to 23.19%) for decline in hearing, 14.81% (95% ci: 10.07% to 19.55%) for poor sleep quality, 18.52% (95% ci: 13.34% to 23.70%) for worry about disease recurrence, 18.98% (95% ci: 13.75% to 24.21%) for anxiety, and 25.00% (95% ci: 19.23% to 30.77%) for depression. Mean survival times were 4.32 +/- 2.63 years in patients with mouth dryness or sores, 4.26 +/- 2.90 years in patients with fatigue, and 5.60 +/- 2.94 years in patients with a decline in hearing. The mean global qol score was 74.21 (95% ci: 72.22 to 76.20). At a significance level of alpha = 0.05, the factors influencing qol were age (p = 0.032), education level (p = 0.001), anxiety score (p < 0.001), depression score (p < 0.001), mouth dryness or sores (p < 0.001), fatigue (p = 0.027), and disease stage (p = 0.044). Conclusions The prevalence rates of mouth dryness or sores, fatigue, decline in hearing, depression, and anxiety were high in npc survivors with a survival time of more than 2 years. These rt-induced symptoms and psychological problems can last for many years after rt. The qol of the npc survivors was good. Factors influencing qol were age, education level, anxiety, depression, mouth dryness or sores, fatigue, and disease stage. Our results suggest that during clinical treatment, doctors should minimize the radiation dose to the ears of patients. In addition, our results emphasize the importance of providing oral and ear nursing and psychological care to npc survivors.Copyright © 2015 Multimed Inc.",Excluded,0.965684
2849,"Diagnostic accuracy of 1.5-t unenhanced whole-heart coronary MR Angiography Performed with 32-Channel Cardiac Coils: Initial single-center experience. Purpose: To compare the imaging time and image quality obtained with whole-heart coronary magnetic resonance (MR) angiography performed with fi ve- and 32-channel coils in healthy subjects and determine the accuracy of MR angiography performed with 32-channel coils in the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Materials andMethods: The institutional review board approved the study protocol, and all participants provided written informed consent. The authors studied 10 healthy subjects and 67 patients suspected of having CAD who were scheduled for coronary angiography. Unenhanced 1.5-T coronary MR angiography was performed with fi ve- and 32-channel coils in healthy subjects and with 32-channel coils in patients. Clinicallysignifi cant CAD was defi ned as a diameter reduction of at least 50% at coronary angiography. The sensitivity and specifi city of coronary MR angiography were calculated. Result(s): The mean imaging time was substantially reduced from 2.3 minutes 6 4.2 (standard deviation) with fi ve-channel coils to 6.3 minutes 6 2.2 with 32-channel coils, with equivalent image quality scores. Acquisition of MR angiograms was completed in all 67 patients, with a mean imaging time of 6.2 minutes 6 2.8. The prevalence of CAD in he study population was 58% (39 of the 67 patients). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves determined at vessel- and patient-based analyses were 0.91 and 0.90, respectively; the sensitivity and specifi city at vessel-based analysis were 86% and 93%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Whole-heart coronary MR angiography performed at 1.5 T with 32-channel coils permits noninvasive detection of CAD with substantially reduced imaging time. This noninvasive approach can be an alternative to multidetector computed tomographic coronary angiography for ruling out obstructive CAD in patients who have a contraindication to contrast material and in young subjects who are at higher risk from ionizing radiation. © RSNA, 2011.",Excluded,0.03835098
2850,"Physician's awareness of lung cancer screening and its related medical radiation exposure in Korea. OBJECTIVES: Through a survey on perception of lung cancer screening and accompanying medical radiation exposure in Korea, the present study was to investigate its current situations and evaluate various perception of physicians regarding it in order to propose measures for improvements., METHODS: Medical specialists in national cancer screening institutions selected through stratified random sampling were subjected to face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire. We investigated physicians' perception on effectiveness of lung cancer screening depending on screening modality, selection criteria for subjects of screening, types of equipment used to screen, and perception for seriousness of adverse effects following the test. In addition, odds ratios to underestimate risk of radiation exposure from screening were calculated through logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: Each response that chest X-ray is effective for lung cancer screening and that smoking history is not considered prior to screening recommendation accounted for more than 60% of respondents, suggesting the chance of unnecessary screening tests. Regarding adverse effects of lung cancer screening, about 85% of respondents replied that false positive, radiation exposure, and overdiagnosis could be ignored. About 70% of respondents underestimated radiation dose from lung cancer screening, and a low proportion of physicians informed patients of radiation exposure risk., CONCLUSIONS: It was found that most physicians underestimated harms of lung cancer screening including radiation exposure and were lack of awareness regarding lung cancer screening. It should be noted that physicians need to have proper perceptions about screening recommendation and accompanying possible harms, for successful implementation of the screening program.",Excluded,0.78004974
2851,"Low-dose coronary computed tomography angiography using prospective ECG-triggering compared to invasive coronary angiography. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of prospective ECG-triggering 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) coronary angiography for evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). Forty-two patients (31 males, 11 females, mean age 64 years) underwent cardiac CT and invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Patients with a heart rate of <65 beats/min with stable heart rhythm were included in the study sample. We used a prospective ECG-triggering protocol. Luminal narrowing over 50% was considered to be significant according to a modified 17-segment AHA model, using invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as the standard of reference. The mean radiation dose was 3.5 mSv +/- 0.3 (range, 3.3-4.2 mSv), and 542 of 549 segments (98.7%) in the 42 patients were diagnostic. In contrast, 119 of 542 segments (22%) were diagnosed as significant by ICA. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV were 95.0, 96.2, 96, 85.8 and 98.8%, respectively. False positive results were affected by densely calcified plaques, whereas false negatives were caused by motion artifact with poor vessel attenuation at the distal segments or near the bifurcation area of the coronary arteries. Prospective ECG-triggering MDCT is a useful method for evaluating CAD in patients with a lower heart rate with low radiation dose. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",Excluded,0.03840853
2852,"Effect of proton-pump inhibitors on the risk of lower gastrointestinal bleeding associated with NSAIDs, aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin. BACKGROUND: We investigated the effects of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) on lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and of their interactions with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin on LGIB risk., METHODS: We prospectively studied 355 patients emergently hospitalized for LGIB and 8,221 nonbleeding patients. All patients underwent colonoscopy. Smoking, alcohol drinking, drug exposure, and the Charlson comorbidity index score were assessed before colonoscopy. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) of LGIB were estimated., RESULTS: LGIB was significantly associated with older age, higher comorbidity index, and NSAID, aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin use. PPI use was significantly associated with older age, male sex, being a current alcohol drinker, higher comorbidity index, and NSAID, aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, acetaminophen, or corticosteroid use. Multivariate analysis adjusted by the confounding factors revealed LGIB was not significantly associated with PPI use (AOR 0.87; 95 % confidence interval 0.68-1.13; p = 0.311), or specifically with omeprazole (AOR 1.18; p = 0.408), esomeprazole (AOR 0.76; p = 0.432), lansoprazole (AOR 0.93; p = 0.669), or rabeprazole (AOR 0.63; p = 0.140). In the interaction model, no significant interactions were observed between PPIs and NSAIDs (AOR 1.40; p = 0.293), aspirin (AOR 1.09; p = 0.767), clopidogrel (AOR 0.99, p = 0.985), or warfarin (AOR 1.52; p = 0.398)., CONCLUSIONS: This large case-control study demonstrated that PPI use did not lead to an increased risk of LGIB, regardless of the type of PPI used.

2853,"A phase II trial of stereotactic body radiation therapy for operable T1N0M0 non-small cell lung cancer: Japan clinical oncology group (JCOG0403). Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a rapidly prevailing treatment modality suggesting high effectiveness in the treatment of medically inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It has also been applied in operable stage I NSCLC patients, but the prospective data have not been available yet. The purpose of JCOG0403 was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SBRT in patients with both operable and medically inoperable T1N0M0 NSCLC (UICC 6th ed., 2002), and this is the first report analyzed for operable population. Materials/Methods: The eligibility criteria included histologically or cytologically proven NSCLC, clinical T1N0M0, operable patients assessed by thoracic surgeons, PS 0-2, >= 20 years old, PaO2 >= 60 torr, FEV1.0>= 700 mL, and written informed consent. The prescription was 48 Gy at the isocenter in 4 fractions over 4-8 days. 4-10 MV X rays were allowed. Heterogeneity corrected doses by pencil beam algorithms were used. The GTV included the primary tumor only, CTV margin was not considered, and ITV margin and 5 mm setup margin were added. As a quality assurance program, credentialing of institutions and an individual case review using the Image-guided Therapy Center (ITC) remote review tool were performed. The primary endpoint was the three-year overall survival. The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), local-progression free survival (LPFS), event-free survival (EFS), toxicity, and patterns of failure. The sample size was determined so that the 95% confidence interval for the estimated 3-year OS would be +/- 10% around expected value of 80%. Result(s): Between July 2004 and January 2007, 65 patientswere registered in this study from15 institutions.The patients characteristics were:male 45, female 20; median age 79 (range, 50-91);median tumor size 21mm(range, 10-30mm); adenocarcinomas 40, squamous cell carcinomas 21, others 4; and PS 0/1/2, 43/20/2. All patients completed the protocol treatment. At the last follow-up in November 2009, median follow-up of censored cases was 45.4 months. of the eligible 64 patients, the 3-year overall survival was 76.0% (95% CI: 63.3% - 84.8%). To date, a total of 25 progressions were observed, and the 3-year PFS, LPFS, and EFS were 54.5% (95% CI: 41.5% - 65.7%), 68.5% (95% CI: 55.5% -78.4%) and 51.4% (95% CI: 38.6% - 62.9%), respectively. Grade 3 toxicity was observed in chest pain 1 (1.5%), dyspnea 2 (3.1%), hypoxia 1 (1.5%), and pneumonitis 2 (3.1%). No grade 4 and 5 toxicity was observed.

Purpose/Objective(s): To assess the outcomes for adult patients treated for medulloblastoma at a large academic center. Materials/Methods: Wereviewed our experience in treating adult (age.18) patientswith a diagnosis ofmedulloblastoma. Information was gathered retrospectively on 66 patients who were seen at the time of initial diagnosis at our institution from1969 to 2008. Pathology was reviewed at the time of this analysis for all patients with available slides.Median age was 33. 44 patients hadM0 disease, 9 had M1, and 13were classified asMX.31 patientswere classified as high risk, 31 as standard risk and 4 patients had incomplete information for risk stratification. Classic histology was the most common type (n = 40) followed by desmoplastic (n = 9) and large cell/ anaplastic (n = 1). Radiation information was available in 64 patients. 61 received craniospinal radiotherapy (median dose 36 Gy) and 62 received posterior fossa radiotherapy (median total dose 55 Gy). 28 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy which was most commonly cisplatin based. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS)were estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves.Any recurrence or deathwas counted as an event in the estimation of PFS. Cox regression analysiswas used to compare recurrences between different groups (only patients that recurred were counted as having an event). The effect of chemotherapy in different groups was also assessed. Result(s):Median follow-upwas 80months. The estimated 5-yearOS and PFSwas 74%and 59%, respectively.High risk classification was associatedwithworseOS (p= 0.03) and recurrence (HR2.56, p= 0.05) and trend forworse PFS(p= 0.1313). Five-yearOSand PFS was 61% and 49% for high-risk, compared to 86% and 69% for patients classified as standard risk. Gross total resection (GTR) was associatedwith an improvement inOS (p = 0.03) and a trend toward improved PFS (p = 0.09) compared to subtotal resection or biopsy. No significant differenceswere observed for gender, location (midline vs. lateral), radiation dose, histologic type, anaplasia extent, treatment era or use ofMRI for staging.No benefit for chemotherapy could be demonstrated for the group as a whole. For high risk patients with classic histology (n= 25), chemotherapywas associatedwith animprovement in 5 year PFS from36%to 71%(p = 0.10 by log-rank and 0.05 by Wilcoxon test) and an improvement in 5 year OS from 49% to 100% (p = 0.08 by log-rank and 0.04 by Wilcoxon test). Conclusion(s): In adult patients with medulloblastoma, extent of resection and risk group are predictors of outcome. No significant difference in outcomes was observed by treatment era. These exploratory results suggest a possible benefit for chemotherapy in the group of high risk patients with classic histology.",Excluded,0.038880058

Purpose: To perform a Phase I study of preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) with S-1, a novel oral fluoropyrimidine, plus oxaliplatin in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose. Methods and Materials: Radiotherapy was delivered to a total of 45 Gy in 25 fractions and followed by a coned-down boost of 5.4 Gy in 3 fractions. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of a fixed dose of oxaliplatin (50 mg/m2/week) on Days 1, 8, 22, and 29 and escalated doses of S-1 on Days 1-14 and 22-35. The initial dose of S-1 was 50 mg/m2/day, gradually increasing to 60, 70, and 80 mg/m2/day. Surgery was performed within 6 +/- 2 weeks. Result(s): Twelve patients were enrolled and tolerated up to Dose Level 4 (3 patients at each dose level) without dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 3 patients were enrolled at Dose Level 4, with 1 experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity of Grade 3 diarrhea. Although maximum tolerated dose was not attained, Dose Level 4 (S-1 80 mg/m 2/day) was chosen as the recommended dose for further Phase II studies. No Grade 4 toxicity was observed, and Grade 3 toxicities of leukopenia and diarrhea occurred in the same patient (1 of 15, 6.7%). Pathologic complete responses were observed in 2 of 15 patients (13.3%). Conclusion(s): The recommended dose of S-1 was determined to be 80 mg/m2/day when combined with oxaliplatin in preoperative CRT, and a Phase II trial is now ongoing.

2856,"Radiotherapy in the treatment of solitary plasmacytoma. Solitary plasmacytoma of bone (SPB) and extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) are rare. High local control rates are reported with radiotherapy, although the optimal dose and extent of radiotherapy portals remains controversial. Between 1983 and 1993, 30 patients with solitary plasmacytoma were seen at the Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, India. 23 patients had SPB and seven EMP. The mean age was 52 years and the male to female ratio 3.2:1. Diagnosis of SPB was confirmed by biopsy in 16 patients and tumour excision in seven. 20 patients received megavoltage radiotherapy to the bone lesion with limited margins, and one received chemotherapy. Two patients who underwent complete tumour excision received no further treatment. All seven patients with EMP received megavoltage radiotherapy, four following biopsy and three after tumour excision. Local control was achieved in all patients with SPB. Nine progressed to multiple myeloma and one developed a solitary plasmacytoma in another bone. Six patients with EMP achieved local control. Three later progressed to multiple myeloma and one had local relapse. Median time to relapse was 28 months in SPB and 30 months in EMP. 5-year overall survival rates were 82% and 57% for patients with SPB and EMP, respectively. The corresponding progression free survival rates were 55% and 50%, respectively. Age, sex, site of tumour, serum M protein and haemoglobin levels did not significantly influence progression free survival. The extent of surgery, radiotherapy dose or time to relapse were not significant prognostic factors. Radiotherapy appears to be an effective modality of treatment of solitary plasmacytoma. No dose-response relationship is observed, and high local control rates are achieved with limited portals. Progression to multiple myeloma is the commonest pattern of failure, although no prognostic factors for progression are identified.

2857,"Post-operative stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of intracranial haemangiopericytoma: 'A Study of Dose and Outcome'. Introduction: This study was performed to assess the relationship between tumour response and radiation dose in equivalent 2 Gy per fraction (EQD2). Method(s): A retrospective cohort analysis of 21 patients with a diagnosis of intracranial haemangiopericytoma between 2000 and 2013 was included in this study. A total of 39 lesions were analysed. The equivalent dose in 2 Gy per fraction was calculated by assigning an alpha-beta ratio of 12 Gy. A paired t-test compared dose (EQD2) and tumour response, and as the outcome was binary, a logistic regression analysis was performed. Result(s): In total, there were 14 cases of progression and 25 cases of non-progression. It was estimated that for a one unit increase in EQD2, the odds of non-progression were increased by a factor of 1.13 (P = 0.026). After adjusting for PTV volume, the estimated effect of EQD2 (min) on tumour response was stronger, with an estimated odds ratio of 1.36 for an increase of one unit and an odds ratio of 21.6 for an increase of 10 units (P = 0.015). The dose range varied with varying PTV volumes. Based on the logistic model, the probability of having non-progression is larger than 50% for EQ2Dmin doses larger than 30-40 Gy, in particular for volumes larger than 3.67 cm3. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that there is a relationship between dose (EQD2) and outcome. With increasing dose, the likelihood of regression is higher. When adjusted for PTV volume, the response appeared stronger. The dose varied significantly with changes in the size of the PTV.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

We aimed to quantitate the relationship between personal solar UV exposure and serum 25hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration. Blood was collected for 25(OH)D analysis in 207 South Australian adults aged 27-61 years. At the time of blood collection, each participant completed a questionnaire, which included a calendar for recall of sun exposure in the preceding 16 weeks. We examined the association between solar UV exposure and serum 25(OH)D graphically from smoothed scatter plots, and modeled it using multiple linear regression, with age, sex and body mass index as covariates. Estimated erythemal solar UV exposure in the 6 weeks before blood collection best predicted serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Serum 25(OH)D rose with increasing personal solar UV exposure to a maximum of about 89 nmol L(-1) at an estimated mean weekly solar erythemal UV exposure of about 1230 mJ cm(-2). The maximum was the same after accounting for clothing coverage and was reached at an estimated whole body equivalent exposure to ambient UV of ca 700 mJ cm(-2). These results suggest that an average maximum serum 25(OH)D of ca 89 nmol L(-1) is achieved from sun exposure in a healthy Australian adult population. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

2861,"Measuring and assessing individual external doses during the rehabilitation phase in Iitate village after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident in 2011, Iitate village was placed under an evacuation order because the level of radioactive materials drifting from the nuclear plant to the village was above a government-set level for allowing residents to live in the area. The evacuation advisory for most of the village was lifted on 31 March 2017. For displaced residents deciding whether or not to return to their homes, it is important to correctly understand and estimate the realistic individual external doses they will receive after returning to the village. In this study, with the support of residents of the village, we used a personal dosimeter (D-Shuttle) coupled with a global positioning system device to measure and thus understand realistic individual external doses while the residents were in Iitate village and to project the individual external doses for different administrative districts as of 1 April 2017. The measured individual external doses measured by D-Shuttle for 38 study participants showed that the doses measured during time spent inside the village were higher and more widely distributed than the doses measured during time spent outside the village. The exposure ratio (ER) was defined as the ratio of additional individual external dose measured by D-Shuttle to the additional ambient dose based on an airborne monitoring survey. The medians of the average ERs were 0.13 (min-max 0.06-0.27) for time spent at home and 0.18 (min-max 0.08-0.36) for time spent outdoors. Projected additional annual individual external doses as of 1 April 2017 for different administrative districts in the village were calculated using ERs obtained in this study. Assuming that individuals spent 8 h per day on outdoor activities and 16 h on indoor activities, additional annual individual external doses were estimated to be below 3 mSv using the mean of the average ERs for most districts in the village, and these values were well below the individual external doses estimated using the approach taken by the central government. The results of this study provide valuable information both for understanding realistic radiological situations in the village and for those who want to know their future individual external dose in order to make a decision on whether or not to live in the village.",Excluded,0.8585949

Background: The purpose of this study was to identify clinical and dosimetric factors associated with radiotherapy induced bone injury (RIBI) following stereotactic lung radiotherapy. Method(s): Inoperable patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer, treated with SBRT, who received 54 or 60 Gy in 3 fractions, and had a minimum of 6 months follow up were reviewed. Archived treatment plans were retrieved, ribs delineated individually and treatment plans re-computed using heterogeneity correction. Clinical and dosimetric factors were evaluated for their association with rib fracture using logistic regression analysis; a dose-event curve and nomogram were created. Result(s): 46 consecutive patients treated between Oct 2004 and Dec 2008 with median follow-up 25 months (m) (range 6 - 51 m) were eligible. 41 fractured ribs were detected in 17 patients; median time to fracture was 21 m (range 7 - 40 m). The mean maximum point dose in non-fractured ribs (n = 1054) was 10.5 Gy +/- 10.2 Gy, this was higher in fractured ribs (n = 41) 48.5 Gy +/- 24.3 Gy (p < 0.0001). On univariate analysis, age, dose to 0.5 cc of the ribs (D0.5), and the volume of the rib receiving at least 25 Gy (V25), were significantly associated with RIBI. As D0.5 and V25 were cross-correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.57, p < 0.001), we selected D0.5 as a representative dose parameter. On multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio: 1.121, 95% CI: 1.04 - 1.21, p = 0.003), female gender (odds ratio: 4.43, 95% CI: 1.68 - 11.68, p = 0.003), and rib D0.5 (odds ratio: 1.0009, 95% CI: 1.0007 - 1.001, p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with rib fracture.Using D0.5, a dose-event curve was constructed estimating risk of fracture from dose at the median follow up of 25 months after treatment. In our cohort, a 50% risk of rib fracture was associated with a D0.5 of 60 Gy. Conclusion(s): Dosimetric and clinical factors contribute to risk of RIBI and both should be included when modeling risk of toxicity. A nomogram is presented using D0.5, age, and female gender to estimate risk of RIBI following SBRT. This requires validation. © 2012 Taremi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded,0.03838858

2864,"Robustness of IMPT treatment plans with respect to inter-fractional set-up uncertainties: Impact of various beam arrangements for cranial targets. In the current study IMPT plan robustness was evaluated with respect to inter-fractional patient positioning for various beam arrangements and two tumor indications in the cranial region. Material and methods. For 14 patients suffering from tumors in the cranial region [skull base (SB; n = 7) and paranasal sinus (PS; n = 7)] the CTV and OARs were delineated. A safety margin of 3 mm was applied to the CTV. A prescribed dose of 2 GyE was planned via three beam arrangements (alpha, beta, gamma). Beam arrangement alpha consisted of lateral opposed fields for both tumor groups while beam arrangement beta was optimized according to respective tumor and OAR locations, using two beams only. Beam arrangement gamma applied four beams in the SB group and three beams in the PS group. Dose distributions were recalculated subjected to virtual patient translations along the major anatomical axes. The following dosimetric indices were evaluated and compared to original plans: target coverage (TC), target dose homogeneity (HI), CTV median and average dose (Dmedian, Dmean). For OARs near maximum dose and average dose (D2%, Dmean) were evaluated. Results. Dose distributions were distorted after introducing shifts. In the SB group, TC and HI were significantly different for caudal, cranial and anterior shifts for all beam arrangements. For PS patients, all but right shifts differed significantly from the original plans for all beam arrangements, although clinical relevance was not reached for arrangement gamma (DELTATC < 1.5%). In general, beam arrangement gamma exhibited the least spread of data regarding target indices and was consequently considered the most robust. Dosimetric parameters regarding the brainstem were mostly influenced by shifts along the anterio-posterior axis. Conclusion. For cranial IMPT, set-up uncertainties may lead to pronounced deterioration of dose distributions. According to our investigations, multi-beam arrangements were dosimetrically more robust and hence preferable over two beam arrangements. © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded,0.03839108

2868,"Carbon ion radiotherapy for oligo-recurrent lung metastases from colorectal cancer: A feasibility study. Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for oligo-recurrent lung tumors from colorectal cancer (CRC). Method(s): From May 1997 to October 2012, 34 consecutive patients with oligo-recurrent pulmonary metastases from CRC were treated with CIRT. The patients were not surgical candidates for medical reasons or patient refusal. Using a respiratory-gated technique, carbon ion therapy was delivered with curative intent using 4 coplanar beam angles. A median dose of 60 GyE (range, 44-64.8 GyE) was delivered to the planning target volume (PTV), with a median daily dose of 15 GyE (range, 3.6-44 GyE). Treatment outcome was analyzed in terms of local control rate (LCR), survival rate, and treatment-related complications. Result(s): In total, 34 patients with 44 oligo-recurrent pulmonary lesions were treated with CIRT. Median follow-up period was 23.7 months. The 2- and 3-year actuarial LCRs of the treated patients were 85.4% +/- 6.2% and 85.4% +/- 6.2%, respectively. Overall survival was 65.1% +/- 9.5% at 2 years, and 50.1% +/- 10.5% at 3 years. Although survival rates were relatively worse in the subsets of patients aged < 63 years or with early metastasis (< 36 months after resection of primary site), these factors were not significantly correlated with overall survival (P = 0.13 and 0.19, respectively). All treatment-related complications were self-limited, without any grade 3-5 toxicity. Conclusion(s): CIRT is one of the most effective nonsurgical treatments for colorectal lung metastases, which are relatively resistant to stereotactic body radiotherapy.

2869,"The usefulness of radiation therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. BACKGROUND/AIMS: The usefulness of radiation therapy (RT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still controversial. To clarify whether RT has its role in the management of HCC as a single modality or in combination with other modalities, we analyzed the clinical features of the patients treated with RT retrospectively. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-two patients who underwent RT for intrahepatic lesions with total dose ranging from 58 to 68 Gy were studied. Regression rate for 21 of the irradiated lesions was calculated using the computed tomographic scans. RESULTS. After the size of the irradiated intrahepatic tumor initially decreased, it remained unchanged for a long period. Tumor size at the latest follow-up never exceeded pre-RT tumor size except in one patient who was treated by RT only. In 3 of 20 cancer deaths, the irradiated tumors were the direct cause of death. CONCLUSION(S): Local RT for HCC at potentially curative dose can be performed safely in patients with preserved liver function even if they have already been treated with other therapies.

Purpose: The ALARA principle is not only relevant for effective dose (ED) reduction, but also applicable for contrast media (CM) management. Therefore, the aim was to evaluate the feasibility of an ultra-low CM protocol in the assessment of peripheral artery disease (PAD). Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty PAD patients were scanned on third-generation dual-source computed tomography, from diaphragm to the forefoot, as follows: tube voltage: 70 kV, reference effective tube current: 90 mAs, collimation: 192 x 2 x 0.6 mm, with individualized acquisition timing. The protocol ED (mSv) was quantified with dedicated software. CM protocol consisted of 15 ml test bolus and 30 ml main bolus (300 mgI/ml) injected at 5 ml/s, followed by a 40 ml saline chaser at the same flow rate. Aorto-popliteal bolus transit time was used to calculate the overall acquisition time and delay. Objective (hounsfield units-HU; contrast-to-noise ratio-CNR) and subjective image quality (four-point Likert score) were assessed at different anatomical regions from the aorta down to the forefoot. Result(s): Mean attenuation values were exceeding 250 HU from aorta down to the anterior tibial artery with CNR < 13. However, decline in attenuation was observed in more distal region with mean values of 165 and 199 HU, in left and right dorsalis pedis artery, respectively. Mode subjective image quality from the level of aorta down to the popliteal segment was excellent; below the knee mode score was good. The mean ED per protocol was 1.1 +/- 0.5 mSv.

2873,"Elective nodal irradiation with simultaneous integrated boost stereotactic body radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is increasingly being used for pancreatic cancer, even in the neoadjuvant setting for borderline resectable diseases. However, data from RTOG 9704 highlights the importance of elective coverage in resected pancreatic cancer. We evaluate the dose coverage of the elective nodal CTV in the standard tumor only SBRT plans and in alternative dose painting SBRT strategy to cover some nodal volume. Materials/Methods: The standard SBRT plans and the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB)-SBRT plans were retrospectively generated for each of 10 different patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Both plans used IMRT technique and seven to nine non-coplanar 6-10 MV photon beams to deliver 33 Gy in 5 fractions to GTV and PTV1. In SIB-SBRT plans, 25 Gy in 5 fractions was simultaneously prescribed to the elective nodal CTV and PTV2. The elective nodal regions of peri-pancreas, retropancreas, porta-hepatis, and para-aorta were included in CTV depending on the primary tumor location in pancreas. Dose constraints for organs-atrisk (OARs) were referred to the previous multi-institutional SBRT trial. The constraints to luminal OARs, namely stomach, duodenum, and small bowel, were regarded as the hard constraints; D9cc, D3cc, and D1cc of each luminal organ should be less than 15 Gy, 20 Gy, and 33 Gy, respectively. The dose reduction in the target for proximal part from the luminal OARs was allowed to meet the hard constraints. The target coverages and OAR doses were analyzed and compared. Result(s): The tumor was located in the head in 7, the body in 2, and the tail in 1 cases. The mean (range) size of GTV and CTV were 50.4 mL (5.2e106 mL) and 320 mL (93.7e453 mL), respectively. The mean of minimum distances to the closest luminal organs were 2.0 mm (0e13.2 mm). The mean +/- SDs of D95 of GTV in standard SBRT vs. SIB-SBRT plans were 96.6 +/- 7.4% vs. 95.8 +/- 7.6%, respectively (P = 0.40). Whereas, D95 of CTV were 4.4 +/- 5.9 Gy vs. 19.9 +/- 5.3 Gy (P < 0.001), respectively. The OAR doses were significantly higher with SIB-SBRT plans in D9cc of stomach, D1cce9cc of duodenum, and D1cce9cc of small bowel. However, no plans violated the hard constraints with SIBSBRT strategy. Conclusion(s): SIB-SBRT strategy was dosimetrically feasible for covering the elective nodal volume in pancreatic cancer.

Although minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) has widely been developed in patients with lumbar diseases, surgeons risk exposure to fluoroscopic radiation. However, to date, there is no studies quantifying the effective dose during MIS-TLIF procedure, and the radiation dose distribution is still unclear. In this study, the surgeons' radiation doses at 5 places on the bodies were measured and the effective doses were assessed during 31 consecutive 1- to 3-level MIS-TLIF surgeries. The operating surgeon, assisting surgeon, and radiological technologist wore thermoluminescent dosimeter on the unshielded thyroid, chest, genitals, right middle finger, and on the chest beneath a lead apron. The doses at the lens and the effective doses were also calculated. Mean fluoroscopy times were 38.7, 53.1, and 58.5 seconds for 1, 2, or 3 fusion levels, respectively. The operating surgeon's mean exposures at the lens, thyroid, chest, genitals, finger, and the chest beneath the shield, respectively, were 0.07, 0.07, 0.09, 0.14, 0.32, and 0.05 mSv in 1-level MIS-TLIF; 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.18, 0.34, and 0.05 mSv in 2-level; 0.08, 0.09, 0.14, 0.15, 0.36, and 0.06 mSv in 3-level; and 0.07, 0.08, 0.10, 0.15, 0.33, and 0.05 mSv in all cases.

2876,"A transgene-based, embryo-specific lethality system for insect pest management. Biological approaches to insect pest management offer alternatives to pesticidal control. In area-wide control programs that cover entire regions, the sterile insect technique (SIT) can be used to successfully suppress economically important pest species by the mass release of sterilized pest organisms. However, conventional sterilization by ionizing radiation reduces insect fitness, which can result in reduced competitiveness of the sterilized insects. Here we report a transgene-based, dominant embryonic lethality system that allows for generation of large quantities of competitive but sterile insects without the need of irradiation. The system involves the ectopic expression of a hyperactive pro-apoptotic gene that causes embryo-specific lethality when driven by the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) under the regulation of a cellularization gene enhancer-promoter. We have successfully tested this system in Drosophila melanogaster. The embryonic lethality can be suppressed maternally, which will allow it to be combined with transgenic female-specific lethality systems to raise only vigorous but sterile males.",Excluded,0.03946742

After 45 or 70 Gy, the CFU-C decreased to 14 +/- 10% in irradiated areas. This remaining CFU-C population probably reflects a combination of radioresistance and survival in situ, and migration of CFU-C from protected marrow areas. The frequency of peripheral blood CFU-C did not change after irradiation. Endogenous colony stimulating activity (CSA), i.e., release of CSA within the marrow cell population, in post-irradiation bone marrow persisted on roughly the same level, indicating a fairly low radiosensitivity of the CSA-producing cells in the bone marrow. Colony stimulating activity in peripheral blood cells and serum remained unchanged, but there were great interindividual variations, and some of the patients with hypercellularity and CFU-C increase in nonirradiated marrow areas also had increased CSA.

2879,"Endovascular Treatment of Long Superficial Femoral Artery-Chronic Total Occlusions Using the Gogo Catheter With IVUS Via a Popliteal Puncture Method Is Effective, Safe, and Useful. Objectives: We aimed to investigate the usefulness of inserting a 6Fr sheath guided by duplex ultrasonography via a popliteal artery puncture. We also aimed to demonstrate endoluminal tracking using a retrograde approach using the Gogo catheter with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Background(s): The bidirectional approach is useful for increasing the success rate of the procedure for long superficial femoral artery-chronic total occlusions (SFA-CTOs). However, this procedure becomes somewhat complicated. Since the proximal blood vessel diameter is clearly larger than the distal end of the CTO and the body surface duplex guide can also be used in the proximal part, it is easier to introduce a retrograde guidewire (GW) into the proximal end. Method(s): We performed endovascular treatment for long SFA-CTOs with a Gogo catheter + IVUS guide in 31 consecutive cases (male 20/female 11; mean age, 75.6 +/- 7.6) from May 2017 to November 2018. We advanced the IVUS until the true lumen could be confirmed and advanced the Gogo catheter toward the IVUS for reinforcement. We attempted to approach the long CTO by repeating this procedure. We named this procedure the GIP method (GIP: Gogo catheter with IVUS via a popliteal puncture). Hemostasis of the popliteal artery was achieved using a commercially available compression hemostatic kit (Tometa-kun, XEMEX, Japan). Result(s): Successful revascularization was achieved in all cases (in 2 cases, a femoral artery puncture was added, and a bidirectional approach was used, and in 1 case, a CROSSER system was used). On average, the fluoroscopy time was 42.2 +/- 30.4 minutes, radiation dose 93.7 +/- 78.7 mGy, and amount of contrast medium used 15.0 +/- 9.6 mL. The procedure time was defined as from the start of the popliteal artery puncture to the time the GW passed through the CTO lesion, including the posture transformation time from prone to the supine position. The procedure time was 42.1 +/- 40.2 minutes. There were no major adverse events or other major complications, such as a distal embolism, rupture of the CTO lesion, arteriovenous fistula, or major hematoma requiring a transfusion or surgical treatment. Only 2 small hematomas occurred at the popliteal artery puncture site. The patients were treated conservatively and were discharged as usual. Conclusion(s): Endovascular treatment of long SFA-CTOs via the popliteal approach was effective and safe.

2885,"X-irradiation removes endogenous primordial germ cells (PGCs) and increases germline transmission of donor PGCs in chimeric chickens. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are embryonic precursors of germline cells with potential applications in genetic conservation, transgenic animal production and germline stem cell research. These lines of research would benefit from improved germline transmission of transplanted PGCs in chimeric chickens. We therefore evaluated the effects of pretransplant X-irradiation of recipient embryos on the efficacy of germline transmission of donor PGCs in chimeric chickens. Intact chicken eggs were exposed to X-ray doses of 3, 6 and 9 Gy (dose rate = 0.12 Gy/min) after 52 h of incubation. There was no significant difference in hatching rate between the 3-Gy-irradiated group and the nonirradiated control group (40.0 vs. 69.6%), but the hatching rate in the 6-Gy-irradiated group (28.6%) was significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.05). No embryos irradiated with 9 Gy of X-rays survived to hatching. X-irradiation significantly reduced the number of endogenous PGCs in the embryonic gonads at stage 27 in a dose-dependent manner compared with nonirradiated controls. The numbers of endogenous PGCs in the 3-, 6- and 9-Gy-irradiated groups were 21.0, 9.6 and 4.6% of the nonirradiated control numbers, respectively. Sets of 100 donor PGCs were subsequently transferred intravascularly into embryos irradiated with 3 Gy X-rays and nonirradiated control embryos. Genetic cross-test analysis revealed that the germline transmission rate in the 3-Gy-irradiated group was significantly higher than in the control group (27.5 vs. 5.6%; P<0.05). In conclusion, X-irradiation reduced the number of endogenous PGCs and increased the germline transmission of transferred PGCs in chimeric chickens.",Excluded,0.9706468
2886,"Clinical utility of ultra high pitch dual source thoracic CT imaging of acute pulmonary embolism in the emergency department: Are we one step closer towards a non-gated triple rule out?. Objectives/Purpose: Aim of this study was to retrospectively compare the image quality and the radiation dose of an ultra high pitch CT scan for the evaluation of pulmonary embolism and visualization of cardiac structures in comparison to our institution's standard pulmonary embolism protocol. Method and materials: The study cohort consisted of 115 consecutive patients, 57 underwent CT pulmonary angiography on a dual source 128 slice scanner (Siemens Somatom Definition FLASH) via an ultra high pitch mode (Pitch 2.8) while 58 were scanned on a dual source 64 slice scanner (Siemens Somatom Definition Dual Source) with standard pitch (Pitch 0.9). Qualitative image assessment was determined by two blinded radiologists with 3 and 15 years' experience in chest and cardiac CT. Quantitative image assessment was determined by the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and contrast to noise ratio (CNR). Effective radiation dose was calculated via the product of the dose length product. Result(s): For the ultra high pitch protocol, 14% (8/57) were positive for pulmonary embolus compared to 13.7% (8/58) for the standard pitch group. 98.2% of the ultra high pitch scans were diagnostic for pulmonary embolus vs. 94.8% of the standard protocol. Visualization of cardiac structures was significantly improved with the ultra high pitch protocol (p < 0.0001). Significantly more lung parenchymal motion was observed on the standard protocol (p < 0.0001). The mean pulmonary vessel attenuation, SNR, and CNR were not significantly different. The mean effective dose was lower for the ultra high pitch studies (4.09 mSv +/- 0.78 vs. 7.72 mSv +/- 2.60, p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): Ultra high pitch CT imaging for pulmonary embolus is a technique which has potential to assess motion free evaluation of most cardiac structures and proximal coronary arteries at lower radiation doses. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded,0.03829146
2887,"Measuring and Monitoring Skeletal Muscle Mass after Stroke: A Review of Current Methods and Clinical Applications. Objectives: Muscle mass at admission is important to survive stroke, and stroke-induced sarcopenia is a serious problem because of its poor prognosis. Muscle mass measurement and monitoring are essential for appropriate rehabilitation and nutrition management. However, few reviews are available about the muscle mass measurement and monitoring after stroke. Material(s) and Method(s): Several methods are used to assess skeletal muscle mass in stroke, such as computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, bioelectrical impedance analysis, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, biomarkers, and anthropometrics. We summarized the current methods and clinical applications in stroke. Result(s): In stroke, a head CT is used to estimate muscle mass by measuring the temporal muscle. However, it can be conducted retrospectively due to radiation exposure. After stroke, limb muscle atrophy and diaphragm dysfunction are observed using ultrasound. However, ultrasound requires an understanding of the methods and skill. A bioelectrical impedance analysis can be used to assess muscle mass in patients after a stroke unless they have dynamic fluid changes. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is used for follow-up after hospital discharge. Urinary titin N-fragment and serum C-terminal agrin fragment reflect muscle atrophy after stroke. Anthropometrics may be useful with limited resources. Conclusion(s): We summarized the features of each measurement and proved the recent evidence to properly measure and monitor skeletal muscle mass after stroke.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.038341098
2888,"Radiomic analysis in T2W and SPAIR T2W MRI: Predict treatment response to chemoradiotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Background: To investigate the capability of radiomic analysis using T2-weighted (T2W) and spectral attenuated inversion-recovery T2-weighted (SPAIR T2W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting the therapeutic response of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) to chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): Pretreatment T2W- and SPAIR T2W-MRI of 68 ESCC patients (37 responders, 31 nonresponders) were analyzed. A number of 138 radiomic features were extracted from each image sequence respectively. Kruskal-Wallis test were performed to evaluate the capability of each feature on treatment response classification. Sensitivity and specificity for each of the studied features were derived using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were constructed based on the training set (23 responders, 20 nonresponders) for the prediction of treatment response, and then the testing set (14 responders, 11 nonresponders) validated the reliability of the models. Comparison between the performances of the models was performed by using McNemar's test. Result(s): Radiomic analysis showed significance in the prediction of treatment response. The analyses showed that complete responses (CRs) versus stable diseases (SDs), partial responses (PRs) versus SDs, and responders (CRs and PRs) versus nonresponders (SDs) could be differentiated by 26, 17, and 33 features (T2W: 11/11/15, SPAIR T2W: 15/6/18), respectively. The prediction models (ANN and SVM) based on features extracted from SPAIR T2W sequence (SVM: 0.929, ANN: 0.883) showed higher accuracy than those derived from T2W (SVM: 0.893, ANN: 0.861). No statistical difference was observed in the performance of the two classifiers (P=0.999). Conclusion(s): Radiomic analysis based on pretreatment T2W- and SPAIR T2W-MRI can be served as imaging biomarkers to predict treatment response to CRT in ESCC patients.Copyright © Journal of Thoracic Disease.",Excluded,0.20244758
2889,"Low dose radiotherapy is associated with local complications but not disease control in sacral chordoma. BACKGROUND: We reviewed the disease control and complications of the treatment of sacrococcygeal chordoma from four tertiary cancer centers with emphasis on the effects of radiotherapy in surgically treated patients., METHODS: A total of 193 patients with primary sacrococcygeal chordoma from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed. There were 124 males, with a mean age of 59 +/- 15 years and a mean follow-up of 7 +/- 4 years. Eighty-nine patients received radiotherapy with a mean total dose of 61.8 +/- 10.9 Gy., RESULTS: The 10-year disease-free and disease-specific survival was 58% and 72%, respectively. Radiation was not associated with local recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-2.17; P = 0.71), metastases (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.45-1.91; P = 0.85) or disease-specific survival (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.46-2.00; P = 0.91). Higher doses (>=70 Gy; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.20-1.32; P = 0.17) may be associated with reduced local recurrence. Radiotherapy was associated with wound complications (HR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.64-4.82;, P < 0.001) and sacral stress fractures (HR, 4.73; 95% CI, 1.88-14.38; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter review, radiotherapy was not associated with tumor outcome but associated with complications. The routine use of radiotherapy with en-bloc resection of sacrococcygeal chordomas should be reconsidered in favor of a selective, individualized approach with a radiation dose of >=70 Gy.

2890,"Low-dose abdominal CT protocols with a tube voltage setting of 100 kVp or 80 kVp: Performance of radiation dose reduction and influence on visual contrast. AIM: To evaluate the radiation dose, image quality, and influence on visual contrast of low tube voltage abdominal computed tomography (CT) and the effects of display setting optimization., MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty-seven patients were randomly assigned to one of three protocols. Fifty-two patients underwent a 120 kVp protocol, and 53 and 52 patients underwent low-dose protocols with 100 and 80 kVp, respectively. The effective dose (ED), image noise, CT attenuation, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each organ of each protocol were compared using Dunnett's test. Qualitative analysis between the protocols was also performed., RESULTS: The ED of the 100 and 80 kVp protocols were 22% and 37% reduced, respectively. There were no significant differences in the SNR between the protocols (120 kVp: 13.8 +/- 3.5; 100 kVp: 13.9 +/- 3.3; 80 kVp: 13.5 +/- 2.9; p > 0.05). However, there were significant differences in contrast familiarity between the 120 kVp images and all the other images, except 100 kVp images, with optimized display settings (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: In abdominal CT, an 80 kVp setting offers greater radiation dose reduction than a 100 kVp setting without significant deterioration of the SNR; however, the visual contrast between the organs might be changed.

2891,"Malignant melanoma in Connecticut and Denmark. The rising incidence of malignant melanoma of the skin was reviewed using data from the Connecticut Tumor Registry (1935-1974) (Eisenberg et al., 1967) and the Danish Cancer Registry (1943-1972) (Clemmesen, 1965, 1974, 1977). A total of 7,530 cases were analyzed according to age, sex and anatomic site. The total age-adjusted incidence rates were similar for these two areas, despite geographic and demographic differences. However, the most rapid changes in melanoma incidence were observed in females from Denmark and males from Connecticut. In addition, the largest increases occurred for lower-extremity lesions in Danish middle-aged women and trunk-neck melanomas in Connecticut middle-aged men. Melanoma of the face was resistant to changing incidence and occurred in an older age group than melanoma of other skin sites. In general, birth cohort analysis confirmed that changing incidence began for persons born around 1900, but the rising incidence for lower-extremity melanomas in women and trunk-neck melanomas in males began earlier. In comparing incidence for anatomic sites by correcting for surface area and melanocyte density, higher than expected rates were seen for melanoma of the face in both sexes and trunk-neck melanomas in males. The data presented supported the concept that a cumulative exposure to solar radiation may be important in the etiology of melanoma of the face, but short, intense sun exposure is probably related to melanoma in other sun-exposed areas, and that melanoma in areas other than the face is responsible for the rising incidence of this disease.",Excluded,0.040818263
2892,"Comparison of I-131 radioimmunotherapy tumor dosimetry: Unit density sphere model versus patient-specific monte carlo calculations. High computational requirements restrict the use of Monte Carlo algorithms for dose estimation in a clinical setting, despite the fact that they are considered more accurate than traditional methods. The goal of this study was to compare mean tumor absorbed dose estimates using the unit density sphere model incorporated in OLINDA with previously reported dose estimates from Monte Carlo simulations using the dose planning method (DPMMC) particle transport algorithm. The dataset (57 tumors, 19 lymphoma patients who underwent SPECT/CT imaging during I-131 radioimmunotherapy) included tumors of varying size, shape, and contrast. OLINDA calculations were first carried out using the baseline tumor volume and residence time from SPECT/CT imaging during 6 days post-tracer and 8 days post-therapy. Next, the OLINDA calculation was split over multiple time periods and summed to get the total dose, which accounted for the changes in tumor size. Results from the second calculation were compared with results determined by coupling SPECT/CT images with DPM Monte Carlo algorithms. Results from the OLINDA calculation accounting for changes in tumor size were almost always higher (median 22%, range-1%-68%) than the results from OLINDA using the baseline tumor volume because of tumor shrinkage. There was good agreement (median-5%, range-13%-2%) between the OLINDA results and the self-dose component from Monte Carlo calculations, indicating that tumor shape effects are a minor source of error when using the sphere model. However, because the sphere model ignores cross-irradiation, the OLINDA calculation significantly underestimated (median 14%, range 2%-31%) the total tumor absorbed dose compared with Monte Carlo. These results show that when the quantity of interest is the mean tumor absorbed dose, the unit density sphere model is a practical alternative to Monte Carlo for some applications. For applications requiring higher accuracy, computer-intensive Monte Carlo calculation is needed. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded,0.039035365
2893,"Change in fibroblast growth factor 2 expression as an early phase radiotherapy-responsive marker in sequential biopsy samples from patients with cervical cancer during fractionated radiotherapy. Background: The authors previously demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression levels in tumor cells (FGF2-T) may be an indicator of the efficacy of radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer (CC). In the current study, this finding was extended in newly enrolled patients and was investigated further in stromal FGF2 (FGF2-S) expression. Method(s): Sixty-nine patients with CC were recruited as a validation set for the immunohistochemical detection of FGF2-T from biopsy samples that were taken before (pretreatment) or 1 week after the initiation of radiotherapy (midtreatment). The authors also investigated the expression of FGF2 in tumor FGF2-S and investigated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) (also called platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule) in these patients and in an additional 35 patients from a previous study. Result(s): FGF2 expression was detected in tumor cells from all patients and in stromal cells from 87% of patients. FGF2-T was significantly higher in midtreatment samples (P =.0002), and a high ratio of midtreatment/pretreatment FGF2-T was related significantly to a better prognosis (P =.025). Increased VEGF expression after the initiation of radiotherapy was related significantly to positive FGF2-S in pretreatment samples (P =.035); however, it was not related to prognosis or microvessel density detected by CD31 expression. Conclusion(s): Radiation causes a response in tumor cells and adjacent normal cells and changes the extracellular matrix environment. In this study, the authors confirmed their previous findings and demonstrated that changes in FGF2-T expression may be used as a marker to monitor the effectiveness of radiotherapy in patients with CC. These findings should improve patient selection for molecular targeted therapies, such as cytokine inhibitors, after standard-of-care treatment. © 2010 American Cancer Society.",Excluded,0.96899754
2894,"Addition of Astatine-211-Labeled Anti-CD45 Antibody to TBI as Conditioning for DLA-Identical Marrow Transplantation: A Novel Strategy to Overcome Graft Rejection in a Canine Presensitization Model: ""Radioimmunotherapy to Overcome Transfusion-Induced Sensitization"". In a canine model of presensitization using donor blood transfusions, 100% of historical control dogs receiving 9.2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning before dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-identical marrow grafts had graft rejection. In this presensitization model, we investigated whether the addition of monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based targeted radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with astatine-211 (211At) to TBI could overcome graft rejection. 211At is an alpha-particle-emitting isotope that has a short path length, very high energy, and a short t1/2 of 7.2 hours, which allowed targeting radiation to the T cells responsible for graft rejection. Normal canine recipients were given three preceding transfusions of unirradiated whole blood on days -24, -17, and -10 before transplant from their DLA-identical marrow donors. 211At-anti-CD45 mAb was administered on day -3, and TBI followed by marrow grafts on day 0. Six of the 7 dogs (86%) achieved sustained engraftment as assessed by 100% donor chimerism in mononuclear cells, granulocytes, and CD3+ T cells. One dog receiving the lowest CD34+ cell content (0.35 x 106 cells/kg) rejected the graft. There were no late rejections in dogs followed up to 1 year. Graft-versus-host disease was seen in one dog. 211At-anti-CD45 mAb in combination with TBI as conditioning was successful in abrogating graft rejection in 86% of dogs in this presensitization model. 211At-anti-CD45 mAb conditioning with TBI may serve as a novel promising strategy to overcome graft rejection in heavily transfused patients with red cell disorders.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy",Excluded,0.060414176
2895,"Do radiation-induced bystander effects correlate to the intrinsic radiosensitivity of individuals and have clinical significance?. It is well known that patients can vary in their normal tissue response to radiotherapy, and this can be problematic. As a result, radiobiologists have been using in vitro models to assess variation in response and elucidate the genetic determinants of this variation. However, the clinical relevance of these models is currently unknown. In this study, blood samples from healthy controls (n 20) and colorectal carcinoma patients (n 60) were cultured in vitro to assess two radiobiological end points in parallel: intrinsic radiosensitivity assayed by chromosomal aberrations (G2 scores) and radiation-induced bystander effects assayed by viability testing. Increased intrinsic radiosensitivity was observed in colorectal carcinoma donors (55) compared to the healthy donors (5) (P < 0.005). Similarly, more pronounced radiation-induced bystander effects were observed in the colorectal carcinoma donors compared to the healthy donors after 24 h exposure but not after 96 h exposure to donor irradiated cell conditioned medium (ICCM) (P < 0.05). All scores were tested for correlation with the age, sex and clinical stage of the colorectal carcinoma patients. The only statistically significant correlation was found in samples from severe Dukes D patients (P < 0.005), which had low/radioresistant G2 scores. No correlation was found between radiation-induced intrinsic sensitivity and bystander effects, which suggests that they may have separate underlying molecular mechanisms, but they both show clinical relevance in individual patient samples. © 2009 The Radiation Research Society.",Included,0.9707775

Background: The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial 97-14 revealed no difference between radiation delivered for painful bone metastases at a dose of 8 gray (Gy) in 1 fraction (single-fraction radiotherapy [SFRT]) and 30 Gy in 10 fractions (multifraction radiotherapy [MFRT]) in pain relief or narcotic use 3 months after randomization. SFRT for painful vertebral bone metastases (PVBM) has not been well accepted, possibly because of concerns about efficacy and toxicity. In the current study, the authors evaluated the subset of patients that was treated specifically for patients with PVBM. METHOD(S): PVBM included the cervical, thoracic, and/or lumbar spine regions. Among patients with PVBM, differences in retreatment rates and in pain relief, narcotic use, and toxicity 3 months after randomization were evaluated. RESULT(S): Of 909 eligible patients, 235 (26%) had PVBM. Patients with and without PVBM differed in terms of the percentage of men (55% vs 47%, respectively; P =.03) and the proportion of patients with multiple painful sites (57% vs 38%, respectively; P <.01). Among those with PVBM, more patients who received MFRT had multiple sites treated (65% vs 49% for MFRT vs SFRT, respectively; P =.02). There were no statistically significant treatment differences in terms of pain relief (62% vs 70% for MFRT vs SFRT, respectively; P =.59) or freedom from narcotic use (24% vs 27%, respectively; P =.76) at 3 months. Significant differences in acute grade 2 through 4 toxicity (20% vs 10% for MFRT vs SFRT, respectively; P =.01) and acute grade 2 through 4 gastrointestinal toxicity (14% vs 6%, respectively; P =.01) were observed at 3 months, with lower toxicities seen in the patients treated with SFRT. Late toxicity was rare. No myelopathy was recorded. SFRT produced higher 3-year retreatment rates (5% vs 15%; P =.01). CONCLUSION(S): Results for the subset of patients with PVBM in the RTOG 94-17 randomized controlled trial were comparable to those for the entire population.

2897,"Current psychological distress, post-traumatic stress, and radiation health anxiety remain high for those who have rebuilt permanent homes following the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Objective: The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 produced psychological reactions among evacuees. Despite the harsh situation, subsequently, there has been gradual progress in reconstruction, with more than half of the evacuees returning after the evacuation. Our hypothesis is that evacuee mental health will now be better due to new stable living conditions. This study aims to clarify the statuses of psychological distress, post-traumatic stress, and radiation health anxiety among evacuees who have rebuilt permanent homes after evacuation. Method(s): A cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 1600 residents was conducted in 2020. As primary outcomes, the survey measured psychological distress (Kessler 6), post-traumatic stress (post-traumatic stress four-item checklist), and radiation health anxiety. The data are compared for residents who have rebuilt permanent home and those who did not evacuate. Result(s): In the co-variant analysis, the statuses of psychological distress (p < 0.001), post-traumatic stress (p < 0.001), and radiation health anxiety (p < 0.001) are found to still be high, with significant differences when compared to those who did not evacuate. These results are still at an equivalent level for the continuing evacuation.

BACKGROUND: Melatonin, the central neurohormone in circadian rhythm pathways, is recognized to have a variety of immune-enhancing effects. It has previously been shown to reduce ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced erythema in mice and in humans, but there are as yet no published studies on the effects of melatonin on UV-induced immunosuppression in humans., METHODS: We investigated the effects of topical melatonin on solar-simulated (ss) UV-induced suppression of Mantoux reactions in 16 healthy, Mantoux-positive volunteers. Melatonin (5%) and its vehicle were applied in a double-blinded manner to separate areas on the lower back, immediately after each of three consecutive daily ssUV exposures. Various sites on the back received either no irradiation or one of three-graded ssUV doses. Mantoux testing was performed at each site 24 h after the final irradiation, and assessed 72 h later using a reflectance erythema meter. In a separate group of 19 volunteers, the effect of melatonin on minimal erythema dose was assessed both visually and with an erythema meter., RESULTS: We found dose-responsive UV-induced suppression of the Mantoux response in the presence of both vehicle and melatonin; melatonin did not prevent UV-induced immunosuppression in this model.

Background: The efficacy and limitations of salvage gamma knife surgery (GKS) have not been thoroughly described. This study evaluated the efficacy of GKS for treating brain metastases associated with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) after whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) as the first-line radiation therapy. Method(s): Forty-four patients with recurrent or new SCLC-associated brain metastases underwent GKS after receiving WBRT (median age, 62 years; median duration between WBRT and first GKS, 8.8 months). The median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score was 100 (range, 40-100), and the median number of brain metastases at the first GKS was five. Ten patients who partially or completely responded to chemotherapy received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for limited disease. Result(s): The median prescribed dose and number of lesions treated with the initial GKS were 20.0 Gy and 3.5, respectively, and the tumor control rate was 95.8 % (median follow-up period, 4.0 months). The 6-month new lesion-free survival, functional preservation rates, and overall survival were 50.0 %, 94.7 %, and 5.8 months, respectively. Neurological death occurred in 17.9 % of cases. The poor prognostic factors for new lesion-free survival time and functional preservation were >5 brain metastases and carcinomatous meningitis, respectively. Poor prognostic factors for survival time were KPS <70, >10 brain metastases, diameter of the largest tumor >20 mm, and carcinomatous meningitis. Median overall survival time from brain metastasis diagnosis was 16.9 months. Conclusion(s): GKS may be an effective option for controlling SCLC-associated brain metastases after WBRT and for preventing neurological death in patients without carcinomatous meningitis. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Wien.",Excluded,0.038292512

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with liver cirrhosis underwent 64-section multidetector CT. One hundred twenty kilovolt (peak) (kV[p]) with standard contrast material dose of 600 mg of iodine per kilogram (protocol A) and 80 kV(p) with low-contrast material dose of 450 mg of iodine per kilogram (protocol B) CT image sets were reconstructed by using FBP algorithm and that of using IR algorithm with a 60%/40% blend of IR-FBP reconstruction at 80-kV(p) image set (protocol C). Scans obtained during 3 hepatic phases were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULT(S): The mean radiation dose and the contrast medium dose were significantly lower under protocols B and C than under protocol A. In all hepatic phases, all signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were greater under protocol C than under other protocols at all anatomic sites. Qualitative analysis showed that image noise and diagnostic acceptability were significantly higher under protocol C.

2901,"Transgenerational effects of preconception paternal contamination with (55)Fe. The conjecture that germline mutations induced by radiation exposure before conception may predispose subsequent offspring to cancer remains contentious. Previous experimental studies have shown that preconception paternal irradiation with (239)Pu induces perturbations in the hemopoietic systems of offspring and influences sensitivity to a secondary carcinogen. In the present study, male DBA2 mice were injected intravenously with the Auger electron emitter (55)Fe (4 kBq g(-1)) 18 or 84 days before mating with normal females. Comet analysis showed an increased incidence of DNA strand breaks in sperm from contaminated animals after 84 days, but not after 18 days, indicating spermatogonial rather than spermatid damage. Offspring were either assayed for changes in bone marrow stem cells and committed progenitors or challenged with the chemical carcinogen methyl nitrosourea (MNU, 50 mg/kg) at 10 weeks of age and monitored for the onset of malignancy. Offspring from irradiated fathers had normal peripheral blood profiles, although the stem cell population was amplified in offspring arising from those exposed to (55)Fe at 84 days before conception. Exposure to MNU significantly increased the incidence of lympho-hemopoietic malignancies in offspring from the 84-day group, but not in those from the 18-day group. These findings support the hypothesis that aberrations that are potentially leukemogenic may be transmitted to offspring after radiation damage to the paternal germline.",Excluded,0.9707219

At 2 and 3 years, the locoregional relapse-free survival rates were was 68.3% and 60.8%, respectively, while the overall survival rates were 84.1% and 81.7%, respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed significant differences in locoregional relapse-free survival rates for total treatment times of <53 days vs. >53 days, a volume of CTV1PTV (i.e., the volume prescribed 70 Gy) <177 cc vs. >177 cc, a V100 for CTV1PTV of <91% vs. >91%, and a minimum dose to CTV1PTV of <54 Gy vs. >54 Gy. There were no failures in the elective nodal volume, substantiating both the nodal selection criteria and the RTOG consensus guidelines for delineation of neck node levels. Conclusion(s): IMRT for head-neck cancer is feasible, using elective nodal selection criteria along with RTOG consensus guidelines for the radiological boundaries of levels of neck nodes. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

2903,"[Study of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by granulocytes in workers handling x-ray equipment]. In 44 persons (25 women and 15 men), workers handling X-ray equipment in X-ray laboratories the ability was studied of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction by neutrophils. The obtained results were compared with a control group. Besides that subgroups were isolated taking into account the sex of the studied subjects and duration of their work with X-ray equipment (over five years and below five years). In the workers handling X-ray equipment and in the isolated subgroups of women and men, the index of spontaneous NBT reduction turned out to be statistically significantly higher than that in the control group. In the group of studied workers the index of latex-stimulated NBT reduction was statistically significantly lower than that in the control group. Taking into account the duration of work with X-ray equipment in the subgroups of women and men working for over five years, the lowest index of phagocytes was noted. On the basis of the obtained results the following conclusions were formulated: 1. In workers handling X-ray equipment disturbances occur of peripheral blood neutrophil metabolism assessed in the NBT test. 2. Neutrophil phagocytic activity is weakened in persons working over five years with X-ray equipment.",Included,0.97062635
2904,"Utilityof stress perfusion-cardiac magnetic resonance in followup of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions of the left main coronaryartery. Objectives: To assess the accuracy of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) for the diagnosis of angiographic stenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of left main coronary artery (LMCA). Method(s): Patients undergone in the last year PCI of unprotected LMCA and scheduled for conventional X-ray coronary angiography were prospectively evaluated with stress perfusion CMR within 2 weeks before coronary angiography. Main contraindications to CMR and previous coronary artery bypass were exclusion criteria. Stress perfusion CMR was performed to follow a bolus of contrast Gadobutrol, after 3 min of adenosine infusion. Result(s): Between the 50 patients enrolled, only 1 did not finish the CMR protocol and 49 patients with median age 71 (65-75) years (38 male, 11 female) were analyzed. Previous myocardial infarction was present in 31 patients (63%) and multi vessel PCI in 39 (76%). We evaluated 784 coronary angiographic segments and found 75 stenosis or occlusions (prevalence 9.5%), but only 13 stenosis or occlusions in proximal segments (prevalence 6.6%). Patients with coronary stenosis (n=12, 24%) showed a significantly (p=0.002) higher prevalence of diabetes (7 of 12, 58%), while the other main clinical characteristics were similar to patients without coronary stenosis (all p>0.1). At CMR examination, late gadolinium enhancement was present in 25 (51%), reversible perfusion defects in 12 (24%), and fixed perfusion defects in 6 subjects (12%). The only patient with LMCA ristenosis resulted positive at perfusion CMR (Figure 1). CMR stress perfusion resulted positive in 8 of 12 patients with significant coronary lesions (sensitivity 67%, CI 35-90%) and in 4 of 5 patients with significant proximal coronary lesions (sensitivity 80%, CI 28-99). The accuracy of stress perfusion CMR in diagnosis of coronary stenosis was higher when the analysis was performed only in proximal coronary arteries (95%, CI 86-99) compared to overall vessels (84%, CI70-92). Conclusion(s): Stress perfusion CMR could strongly reduce the need for elective coronary angiography in follow up of LMCA PCI and should be validated in further multi center prospective studies.

2905,"Adding concurrent chemotherapy to postoperative radiotherapy improves locoregional control but Not overall survival in patients with salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma-a propensity score matched study. Purpose: To compare the long-term outcomes in patients with salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma (SGACC) treated with post-operative chemoradiotherapy (POCRT) versus post-operative radiotherapy (PORT). Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the records of 91 SGACC patients treated with surgery followed by PORT (n = 58) or POCRT (n = 33) between 2000 and 2013. Treatment outcomes between groups were compared using propensity score matching (1:1 nearest neighbor). Result(s): The median radiation dose was 66 Gy, and patients were followed up for a median of 71 months. Cisplatin-based concurrent regimens were the most commonly used chemotherapy schedules. In the entire study cohort, patients undergoing POCRT showed a trend toward higher locoregional control (LRC) rates than those treated with PORT alone at both 5 and 8 years (97 and 97 % versus 84 and 79 %, respectively; P =.066). Distant metastases were the most common form of treatment failure and occurred in 31 (34 %) patients (PORT, n = 17; POCRT, n = 14). After propensity score matching (33 pairs), patients receiving POCRT had 5- and 8 year LRC rates of 97 and 97 %, respectively, compared with 79 and 67 % for patients treated with PORT alone (P =.017). The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). However, a significantly better opioid-requiring pain-free survival (ORPFS) was achieved in POCRT group (P =.038). Subgroup analyses revealed that patients with stage III - IV disease (P =.040 and.017), positive surgical margins (P =.011 and.050), or perineural invasion (P =.013 and.035) had significantly higher 5- and 8 year LRC and ORPFS when treated with POCRT, respectively. Conclusion(s): In SGACC patients, adding concurrent chemotherapy to PORT may increase LRC and ORPFS rates, particularly in presence of stage III - IV disease, positive surgical margins, or perineural invasion. However, no significant differences in DMFS, DFS, and OS were observed.Copyright © 2016 Hsieh et al.",Excluded,0.03952806

We used EMS in patients with venous stenosis caused by maligant tumor. EMS were applied in 8 patients. The venogram demonstrated stenosis of vein, and the stenotic ratio were ranged 67-100%. After stent placement, all patients obtained symptomatic relief, and the stenotic ratio improved 20-60% in 7 patients. In one patient, EMS did not expand, but symptom relieved 4 days after stent placement, and following X-ray film showed expansion of EMS. One patient had recurrence of symptom 10 days after stent placement due to dislodgement of EMS. Additional EMS was placed, and symptom improved again. All 8 patients did not suffer recurrence of symptom from 3 weeks to 18 months.

2907,"Feasibility and safety of extended adjuvant temozolomide beyond six cycles for patients with glioblastoma. Introduction: Temozolomide is the first chemotherapeutic agent proven effective for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The drug is well tolerated for its low toxicity. The current standard practice is concomitant chemoradiotherapy for 6 weeks followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide. Some Caucasian studies have suggested that patients might benefit from extended adjuvant cycles of temozolomide (>6 cycles) to lengthen both progression-free survival and overall survival. In the present study, we compared differences in survival and toxicity profile between patients who received conventional 6-cycle temozolomide and those who received more than 6 cycles of temozolomide. Method(s): Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without progressive disease and completed concomitant chemoradiotherapy during a 4-year period were studied. Progression-free survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. t Test, U test, and correlation were chosen accordingly to examine the impact of age, extent of resection, MGMT promoter methylation status and adjuvant cycles on progression-free survival. For factors with a P value of <0.05 in univariate analyses, Cox regression hazard model was adopted to determine the strongest factors related to progression-free survival. Result(s): The median progression-free survival was 17.0 months for patients who received 6 cycles of temozolomide (n=7) and 43.4 months for those who received more than 6 cycles (n=7) [P=0.007, log-rank test]. Two patients in the former group and one in the latter group encountered grade 1 toxicity and recovered following dose adjustment. Cycles of adjuvant temozolomide were correlated with progression-free survival (P=0.016, hazard ratio=0.68). Conclusion(s): Extended cycles of temozolomide are safe and feasible for Chinese patients with disease responsive to temozolomide.Copyright © 2017, Hong Kong Academy of Medicine Press.

2908,"Post-irradiation otitis media, rhinosinusitis, and their interrelationship in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated by IMRT. This study aimed to investigate the occurrences of post-irradiation chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), and their interrelationship in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). A retrospective review of medical records and magnetic resonance imaging for NPC patients across a 5-year follow-up was conducted. Rhinosinusitis was diagnosed and staged by Lund-Mackay system. A total of 102 patients were enrolled in the study. On the 5th year following IMRT, 8 patients (7.8 %), 30 patients (29.4 %), and 17 patients (16.7 %) suffered from IMRT-induced CSOM, post-irradiation OME, and CRS, respectively. Analysis by logistic regression showed a lack of association between the occurrence of post-irradiation OME and CRS (P = 0.06). These observations indicated that the modern radiotherapy technique exhibits capability in decreasing the incidences of CSOM and CRS comparing to the data of traditional radiotherapy. But post-irradiation OME was still encountered in more than one-quarter of long-term survivors of NPC. Of note, rhinosinusitis in NPC survivors does not predispose to the development of post-irradiation OME, suggesting nasal irrigation might be unnecessary for the management of OME following radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.45271304
2909,"Histological examination in assessment of ultraviolet-induced suppression of contact hypersensitivity response. The evaluation of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) reaction is one of the methods used in the assessment of the immune status of an organism after UV radiation. The aim of the study was to compare usefulness of visual scoring system and histological morphometry in the assessment of CHS response after exposure of humans to solar simulated radiation (SSR). The study included 140 healthy volunteers, 33 people were irradiated for 2 days, 34 - for 10 days and 33 - for 30 days with SSR. Forty non-irradiated individuals served as controls. All the volunteers were sensitized with diphenylocyclopropenone (DPCP) 24 h after final exposure. Statistical analysis comparing intensity of CHS reaction based on visual score between irradiated groups and non-irradiated group revealed no differences (p>0.05). We found a significant difference in epidermal thickness between healthy skin and irradiated groups (p<0.05) and a positive correlation between intensity of spongiosis and clinical score for CHS response at 3.2 DPCP site (p<0.000001). A negative correlation between time of irradiation and spongiosis score was revealed (R=-0.28; p<0.001). We conclude that histological examination of biopsies taken from one of the series of elicitation sites is a reliable and sensitive method in the evaluation of CHS response after UVR.",Excluded,0.047405876

2912,"Measured anatomical distributions of solar UVR on strawberry production workers in Italy. The exposure of outdoor workers to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has been known for some time. Measurements of erythemally weighted UVR are usually related to days of exposure and to the anatomical distribution of UVR on the human body. The aim of this research is to describe the UVR exposure of workers during a strawberry production cycle in order to assess the UVR hazard and to identify the highest exposure in the anatomical distribution of UVR on the body during an entire agricultural production cycle. This research was carried out on the experimental farm (Azienda Agraria Didattico- Sperimentale) of Universita Politecnica delle Marche in Agugliano, Italy. A spectrometer was used to measure UVR, and electronic dosimeters were used to record UVR exposure. The measurements were carried out on all working days of the strawberry production cycle in 2012 during daily peak UVR levels. The daily UVR exposure geometric mean and the percentage ambient UVR in the strawberry production cycle were calculated and analyzed to assess the hazard for workers during the entire production cycle. The nape of the neck was the anatomical site most exposed to UVR. The mean daily UVR exposure on the nape of the neck was higher than 1.50 SED, the minimum value required to produce perceptible erythema in unacclimatized white skin, and a maximum value of 2.29 SED was measured. Real-time exposure data suggest that it may be useful to remind workers of the risks associated with UVR exposure. © 2014 ASABE ISSN 1074-7583.",Excluded,0.039104916
2913,"Parotid-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: preserved parotid function after IMRT on quantitative salivary scintigraphy, and comparison with historical data after conventional radiotherapy. PURPOSE: To evaluate the parotid function after parotid-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2003 to May 2004, 16 patients with nonmetastatic NPC underwent parotid-sparing IMRT. Eight of these patients had Stage III or IV NPC based on the 1997 American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. The post-IMRT parotid function was evaluated by quantitative salivary scintigraphy and represented by the maximal excretion ratio (MER) of the parotid gland after sialogogue stimulation. The parotid function of 16 NPC patients who were previously treated with conventional radiotherapy was reviewed as the historical control., RESULTS: In the parotid-sparing IMRT group, all 16 patients were alive and without cancer at the end of follow-up period (median, 24.2 months). The mean parotid MER was 53.5% before radiotherapy, 10.7% at 1 month post-IMRT, and 23.3% at 9 months post-IMRT. In the conventional radiotherapy group, the mean parotid MER was 0.6% at 6 to 12 months postradiotherapy. The difference was statistically significant (23.3% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001, Mann-Whitney test). In the IMRT group, the mean parotid doses ranged from 33.2 Gy to 58.8 Gy (average, 43.9 Gy). The correlation between the mean parotid dose and the percentage decrease of parotid MER at 9 months post-IMRT (dMER) was statically significant (p=0.008, Pearson correlation)., CONCLUSIONS: Although the mean parotid doses are relatively high, the significant preservation of parotid function is achieved with IMRT for NPC patients. The significant correlation between mean parotid dose and parotid dMER demonstrates the dose-function relationship of the parotid gland.",Excluded,0.0384654
2914,"Embo-EVAR: A Technique to Prevent Type II Endoleak? A Single-Center Experience. Background Intraprocedural aneurysm sac embolization (embo-EVAR) during endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair (EVAR) using coils and fibrin glue is a technique for preventing type II endoleak (EII). Our aim is to evaluate feasibility, safety and clinical outcome of this promising approach. Materials and Methods A retrospective clinical case analysis of 72 patients who underwent EVAR during the period 2011-2014. Two groups were compared at 6 and 12 months follow-up with contrast media computed tomography scan and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging: consecutively, 36 patients (group A) treated with classic EVAR and 36 patients (group B) treated with embo-EVAR. Coils were released filling better as possible the aneurysm sac; the embolization was completed by injecting fibrin glue. Device and materials used, differential systemic and sac pressures, presence of any endoleak, and complication were registered. Results In our experience, we had 100% technical success without surgical conversion. Embo-EVAR was performed, after endograft deployment, in group B patients, all with ratio of DELTA-pressures (obtained from DELTA-sac pressure/DELTA-differential pressure) > 0.16. No early or late complications occurred and mortality was nil. Follow-up was performed with computed tomography-angiography and CEUS at 6 and 12 months. We observed 9 type II and 1 type Ia endoleak in group A and 2 type II and 1 type Ib endoleaks in group B. Mean radiation exposure time was 30.3 min in group A and 43.3 min in group B. EVAR procedure average cost was 9,000 . The average cost of sac embolization was 1,500. Conclusions Although a randomized study is necessary, embo-EVAR may be a valid approach to prevent type II endoleaks and further complications. Mild costs and exposure-dose increase could be accepted to avoid reinterventions, and in our experience, it could be routinely performed with excellent results.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.038119826

OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) as an alternative to angiography for the diagnosis of R2A coronary artery (CA) abnormalities., ANIMALS: Twenty-two dogs with a diagnosis of type R2A CA anomaly were reviewed/analyzed., METHODS: A retrospective study of case records. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), angiography, and follow-up investigations of pulmonic stenosis (PS) with R2A CA were carried out to compare different diagnostic methods., RESULTS: Based on the TTE morphology, PS with an aberrant CA was suspected in all dogs (n = 22) and later confirmed by angiography in 18 cases (18/22), and necropsy in two cases (2/22). In 12 cases (12/22), TEE and angiography were both performed and confirmed the diagnosis of an R2A anomaly. Two cases (2/22) were diagnosed only with TEE., CONCLUSIONS: Transesophageal echocardiography may be considered an effective tool to diagnose CA abnormalities, in particular when TTE is inconclusive. Transesophageal echocardiography offers detailed and easily reproducible views of coronary ostia, and the spatial relationship between the right common CA and the great arteries. Although it is not possible to define the course of the more distal coronary branches, TEE has proven reliable in recognizing those elements that can constitute a risk for the execution of a balloon valvuloplasty (BV). Therefore, TEE can be used to confirm this type of CA anomaly and prevent a BV, which is contraindicated in these cases. In addition, TEE avoids any further vascular access, radiation exposure, and contrast medium injection. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.03880794
2916,"The evaluation of different radiological measurement parameters of the degree of collapse of the vertebral body in vertebral compression fractures. For compression fracture, vertebral body height loss (VBHL) and kyphotic angle (KA) are two important imaging parameters for determining the prognosis and appropriate treatment. This study used previous measurement methods to assess the degree of VBHL and KA, compare and examine differences between various measurement methods, and examine the correlation between relevant measurement parameters and intravertebral cleft (IVC) in the vertebral body. The radiographic images (lateral view of the T-L spine) of 18 patients with a single-level vertebral compression fracture were reviewed. We measured 9 characteristic lengths and angles on plain radiographs, including anterior vertebral height (AVH) and AVH of the adjacent upper and lower levels, middle vertebral height (MVH) and MVH of the adjacent upper and lower levels, posterior vertebral height (PVH), and vertebral body width, and assessed 6 parameters, including vertebral compression ratio (VBCR), percentage of anterior height compression (PAHC), percentage of middle height compression (PMHC), kyphotic angle (KA), calculated kyphotic angle (CKA), and IVC. The results showed that VBCR is a simple and rapid method of VBHL assessment, but it may result in an underestimation of the degree of VBHL compared to PAHC. When PMHC < 40% or kyphotic angle > 15degree, the probability of IVC occurring on the vertebral body was higher which means the higher risk of vertebral body instability. The results of this study could provide a reference for surgeons when using imaging modalities to assess the degree of vertebral body collapse.Copyright © 2019 Wei-En Hsu et al.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to generate right ventricular (RV) pressure-volume loops (PVLs) from time-activity curves obtained by first-pass radionuclide angiography (RNA) and RV pressures obtained by right heart catheterization., METHODS AND RESULTS: Short-lived tantalum 178 was used to obtain first-pass RNA at baseline (n = 31), after nitroglycerin (n = 5), or after the conclusion of cardiac catheterization (n = 13). From the radionuclide-derived RV ejection fraction and thermodilution stroke volume, the RV end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume were measured. Special proprietary software was developed and used to integrate the pressure and the RNA data. The mean heart rate was 80 +/- 17 beats/min; RV ejection fraction, 39% +/- 12%; RV end-diastolic volume, 217 +/- 79 mL; RV end-systolic volume, 142 +/- 74 mL; and RV end-diastolic pressure, 10 +/- 7 mm Hg. The RV PVLs were of high quality and reproducible., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides proof of concept of the feasibility of generating RV PVL; the short half-life (10 minutes) and low energy (59 keV) of Ta-178 allow the generation of multiple loops at low radiation exposure.

Purpose: To appraise the role of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with lung metastasis from primary soft tissue sarcoma. Method(s): Twenty-eight patients (51 lesions) were analysed. All patients were in good performance status (1-2 eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG)), unsuitable for surgical resection, with controlled primary tumour and the number of lung metastases was <=4. In a risk adaptive scheme, the dose prescription was: 30 Gy/1 fr, 60 Gy/3 fr, 60 Gy/8 fr and 48 Gy/4 fr. Treatments were performed with Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy. Clinical outcome was evaluated by thoracic and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan before SBRT and than every 3 months. Toxicity was evaluated with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale version 4.0. Result(s): Leiomyosarcoma (36%) and synovial sarcoma (25%) were the most common histologies. Five patients (18%) initially presented with pulmonary metastasis, whereas 23 (82%) developed them at a median time of 51 months (range 11-311 months) from the initial diagnosis. The median follow-up time from initial diagnosis was 65 months (5-139 months) and from SBRT was 21 months (2-80 months). No severe toxicity (grades III-IV) was recorded and no patients required hospitalisation. The actuarial 5-years local control rate (from SBRT treatment) was 96%. Overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 96.2% and 60.5%, respectively. At last follow-up 15 patients (54%) were alive. All other died because of distant progression. Conclusion(s): SBRT provides excellent local control of pulmonary metastasis from soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and may improve survival in selected patients. SBRT should be considered for all patients with pulmonary metastasis (PM) and evaluated in a multidisciplinary team.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.038473953

PURPOSE: This prospective phase II study assessed safety and feasibility of surgery followed by hypofractionated radiosurgery (HSRS) on the tumor bed in oligometastatic patients with single large brain metastases (BMs)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 2015 and May 2018, 101 patients were enrolled. Oligometastatic disease was defined by a maximum of 5 extracranial metastatic lesions. HSRS was performed within 1 month of surgery and consisted of 30 Gy in 3 fractions. Local control, occurrence of new BMs, overall survival, and treatment-related toxicities were assessed., RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 26 months, local recurrence occurred in 6 patients (5.9%). Six-month, 1-year, and 2-year local control rates were 100%, 98.9% +/- 1.1%, and 85.9% +/- 0.6%, respectively. New BMs occurred in 39 patients (38.6%); median brain distant progression time and 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year brain distant progression rates were 39 months (95% CI, 19-39 months), 17% +/- 3.7%, 31.4% +/- 4.8%, and 42.5% +/- 5.9%, respectively. At the last observation time, 50 patients (49.5%) were alive and 51 (50.5%) were dead; 10 patients died owing to neurologic causes and 40 as a result of systemic progression. Median overall survival time and 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year overall survival rates were 22 months (95% CI, 20-30 months), 95% +/- 2.1%, 81.9% +/- 3.8%, and 46.6% +/- 6%, respectively. Infratentorial site, residual tumor volume, longer interval time between primary diagnosis and occurrence of BMs, and oligometastatic disease status significantly influenced outcome. Grade 2 to 3 radionecrosis occurred in 26 patients. Neurocognitive functions remained stable or, in some cases, improved., CONCLUSIONS: Surgery followed by HSRS on the tumor bed is a safe and effective approach, affording good brain control with acceptable toxicities. As for extracranial metastatic sites, patients with BMs can benefit from local ablative treatment in the context of an oligometastatic disease. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Objective: This study aimed to compare the clinical and radiologic outcomes of AO titanium locking plate and screw (ATLPS) and anterograde intramedullary (AIM) fixation for treating unstable metacarpal and phalangeal fractures. Method(s): Adult patients with isolated fresh unstable metacarpal and phalangeal fractures who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled into this prospective study from July 2013. Patients were divided into ATLPS or AIM groups when they were admitted to our department after considering their work requirement, fracture complexity, and surgeon's experience and were then treated accordingly. Relevant demographic, clinical and preoperative clinical data were collected and analyzed. Clinical examination and radiograph evaluation were performed 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Outcome measures were visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain, total range of motion (ROM) of the injured digit, Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores (Quick-DASH) and grip strength (percentage of the contralateral corresponding digit). Result(s): From July 2013 to September 2014, 76 patients were treated by AIM and 71 by ATLPS. Age, sex, time from injury to operation, dominant hand, injury mechanism, fracture location, fracture type and participant occupation were similar in both groups (P > 0.05). Operations were all performed well and followed by uneventful postoperative functional recoveries. At 3-month follow-up, all clinical outcomes were significantly better in the AIM than ATLPS group (P < 0.05) except for VAS pain scores. However, at 6-month follow-up, the differences were no longer significant, indicating similar results for both types of fixation. Patients in the AIM group developed significantly more complications (P = 0.037). Sick leave was significantly longer in the AIM group (P = 0.02). Conclusion(s): AIM outperforms ATLPS in the treatment of unstable metacarpal and phalangeal fractures in the early, but not the later, postoperative period; the latter is associated with significantly more complications. Patients treated by ATLPS require shorter sick leave, which is of particular benefit to workers with specialized manual skills.Copyright © 2016 Chinese Orthopaedic Association and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",Excluded,0.03847723
2921,"The impact of margin reduction on outcome and toxicity in head and neck cancer patients treated with image-guided volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Background and purpose: In recent decades, outcomes of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) have improved as a result of implementing several strategies, such as chemoradiation. However, these improvements were achieved at the cost of increased toxicity. One way to reduce radiation-related toxicity is by reducing the margins. Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2013 and 2016, 206 consecutive patients were treated with CTV-PTV margin of 5 mm and subsequently 208 patients with 3 mm margin. This study evaluates the impact of reducing clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margin on outcome and toxicity. Result(s): All patients were treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with daily-image guidance using cone-beam CT (CBCT). Overall acute grade 3 toxicity was significantly lower in 3 mm-group, compared to 5 mm-group (53.8% vs. 65%, respectively, p = 0.032). The same was true for acute grade 3 mucositis (30.8% vs. 42.2%, p = 0.008) and for acute grade 3 dysphagia (feeding tube-dependence) (22.1% vs. 33.5%, p = 0.026). The incidence of ongoing feeding tube-dependence after 3 months of radiotherapy was 11.1% and 20.4%, respectively (p = 0.012). The 2-year incidence of late grade >=2 xerostomia was 15.8% and 19.4% (p = 0.8). The 2-year loco-regional control rates of patients treated in 3 mm and 5 mm-groups were 79.9% and 79.2% (p = 1.0). The figures for disease-free survival were 71.5% and 72.7 (p = 0.6) and for overall survival were 75.2% and 75.1% (p = 0.9). Conclusion(s): Reducing the CTV-PTV margin from 5 to 3 mm combined with daily CBCT-guided VMAT reduced the severity, frequency, and duration of radiation-related toxicity without jeopardizing outcome.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.038223203
2922,"Is it necessary to approach the severe osteoporotic vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture bilaterally during the process of pkp?. Purpose: The goal of this study was to explore the outcomes of unilateral and bilateral approach percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) using CT-guidance in the treatment of severe osteoporotic single-level vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 89 patients with severe osteoporotic single-level vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture who had undergone unilateral and bilateral PKP surgeries using CT-guidance at our hospital between June 2013 and June 2019, and followed for at least 1 year. All patients were divided into unilateral (the transverse process-pedicle approach, n = 49) and bilateral (the pedicle approach, n = 40) groups. We collected the clinical and radiological evaluation results during postoperative and last follow-up periods. Result(s): Our findings revealed that the surgery time for the unilateral group was significantly shorter than that of the bilateral group at P < 0.05. The amount of bone cement and radiation exposure of the unilateral group were significantly lesser than that of the bilateral group (P < 0.05). Relative to preoperative data, the values of the VAS score and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were significantly improved at 1 day after surgery and the last followup in the two groups (P < 0.05). Notably, the median height of vertebra at 1 day after surgery and the last follow-up in the unilateral group was significantly restored than that of preoperative data (P < 0.05). However, the median height of vertebra at the same time intervals in the bilateral group showed no significant change compared with preoperative data (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the rate of bone cement leakage and incidence of adjacent-level vertebra fracture were not significantly different in the two groups (P > 0.05). Finally, both groups can obtain an asymmetrical distribution of bone cement in the vertebra. Conclusion(s): Compared to the bilateral PKP, unilateral PKP using CT-guidance in the treatment of the sOVBFs exhibits significantly shorter operation time, lesser radiation dose, and complications. Moreover, unilateral PKP can restore the median height of the vertebral body and eventually obtain a symmetrical distribution of bone cement in the vertebra.Copyright © 2021 Tan et al.",Excluded,0.038397066
2923,"Uncertainty in assessment of radiation-induced diffusion index changes in individual patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate repeatability coefficients of diffusion tensor indices to assess whether longitudinal changes in diffusion indices were true changes beyond the uncertainty for individual patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT). Twenty-two patients who had low-grade or benign tumors and were treated by partial brain radiation therapy (PBRT) participated in an IRB-approved MRI protocol. The diffusion tensor images in the patients were acquired pre-RT, week 3 during RT, at the end of RT, and 1, 6, and 18 months after RT. As a measure of uncertainty, repeatability coefficients (RC) of diffusion indices in the segmented cingulum, corpus callosum, and fornix were estimated by using test-retest diffusion tensor datasets from the National Biomedical Imaging Archive (NBIA) database. The upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence interval of the estimated RC from the test and retest data were used to evaluate whether the longitudinal percentage changes in diffusion indices in the segmented structures in the individual patients were beyond the uncertainty and thus could be considered as true radiation-induced changes. Diffusion indices in different white matter structures showed different uncertainty ranges. The estimated RC for fractional anisotropy (FA) ranged from 5.3% to 9.6%, for mean diffusivity (MD) from 2.2% to 6.8%, for axial diffusivity (AD) from 2.4% to 5.5%, and for radial diffusivity (RD) from 2.9% to 9.7%. Overall, 23% of the patients treated by RT had FA changes, 44% had MD changes, 50% had AD changes, and 50% had RD changes beyond the uncertainty ranges. In the fornix, 85.7% and 100% of the patients showed changes beyond the uncertainty range at 6 and 18 months after RT, demonstrating that radiation has a pronounced late effect on the fornix compared to other segmented structures. It is critical to determine reliability of a change observed in an individual patient for clinical decision making. Assessments of the repeatability and confidence interval of diffusion tensor measurements in white matter structures allow us to determine the true longitudinal change in individual patients.",Excluded,0.9701607
2924,"Therapeutic outcomes of papillary thyroid cancer patients in different risk groups. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the therapeutic outcome of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patients in different risk groups in one institute. Method(s): A total of 1,759 PTC patients were categorized into low-(n = 1,123), intermediate-(n = 75), and high-risk (n = 561) groups according to tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Result(s): Of the patients, 15.1% presented with lymph node metastases, and 4.6% presented with distant metastases at the time of thyroid operation. After 8.0 +/- 0.1 years of follow-up, 73 (4.2%) patients died of thyroid cancer. Tumor size, local invasion, and lymph node metastases adversely influenced recurrence and survival. Of the patients in the 3 groups, 9 (0.8%), 8 (10.7%), and 56 (10.0%) died of thyroid cancer, respectively. In addition, 88 (7.8%), 14 (18.7%), and 144 (25.8%) patients showed recurrence during the follow-up period. Patients with highly aggressive histological patterns showed increased recurrence and cancer mortality compared with the low-risk group; otherwise, values were not higher than those of the high-risk group. Conclusion(s): The cancer-related mortality was nearly 10% in the intermediate-and high-risk groups, and the patients in these groups required aggressive surgical and postoperative adjuvant therapies. © 2011 S.

There is a statistically significant relationship between the extent of surgery and the local control (19.4% of relapse after complete resection vs. 41.2% of relapse after partial resection or biopsy, p= 0.0001). Mediastinal radiation dose (>=50. Gy) had a significant effect in decreasing recurrence (p= 0.0001) and distant metastasis (p= 0.011).

2926,"Surgical Selection of Unstable Intertrochanteric Fractures: PFNA Combined with or without Cerclage Cable. Due to the instability of unstable intertrochanteric fractures, the selection of a suitable internal fixation has always been a challenge for orthopedic surgeons. This study is aimed at comparing the clinical efficacy of PFNA combined with cerclage cable and without cerclage cable and finally recommend a stable internal fixation method to provide the basis for clinical therapy. From January 2014 to January 2018, we retrospectively analyzed all cases of unstable intertrochanteric fractures who received treatment in the Orthopedics Department of our hospital and finally screened 120 cases, 51 of whom were treated with cerclage cable, 69 without cerclage cable. The follow-up period was one year. HHS, BI, and RUSH scores were given within the specified time. We divided the patients into the PFNA+cable (PFNA combined with cerclage cable) group and the PFNA group. The time of fracture healing and weight-bearing in the PFNA+cable group was shorter than that in the PFNA group. With regard to HHS, BI, and RUSH, the PFNA+cable group was higher than the PFNA group at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after operation. For HHS rating, the PFNA+cable group has a higher excellent rate than the PFNA group, which was 96.1% and 84.1%, respectively. All the results mentioned above were statistically significant. Compared with the group without cerclage cable, the application of cerclage cable can reduce the incidence of complications. From the comparison between the two groups, it can be seen that the surgical method of PFNA combined with cerclage cable can not only help to improve the stability of fracture reduction, shorten the time of fracture healing and postoperative weight-bearing, and significantly improve patients' self-care ability but also reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. Therefore, we think PFNA combined with cerclage cable is a good choice.Copyright © 2021 Chaoqing Huang and Xing Wu.",Excluded,0.038530756
2927,"Response-driven imaging biomarkers for predicting radiation necrosis of the brain. Radiation necrosis is an uncommon but severe adverse effect of brain radiation therapy (RT). Current predictive models based on radiation dose have limited accuracy. We aimed to identify early individual response biomarkers based upon diffusion tensor (DT) imaging and incorporated them into a response model for prediction of radiation necrosis. Twenty-nine patients with glioblastoma received six weeks of intensity modulated RT and concurrent temozolomide. Patients underwent DT-MRI scans before treatment, at three weeks during RT, and one, three, and six months after RT. Cases with radiation necrosis were classified based on generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) of whole brain and DT index early changes in the corpus callosum and its substructures. Significant covariates were used to develop normal tissue complication probability models using binary logistic regression. Seven patients developed radiation necrosis. Percentage changes of radial diffusivity (RD) in the splenium at three weeks during RT and at six months after RT differed significantly between the patients with and without necrosis (p = 0.05 and p = 0.01). Percentage change of RD at three weeks during RT in the 30 Gy dose-volume of the splenium and brain gEUD combined yielded the best-fit logistic regression model. Our findings indicate that early individual response during the course of RT, assessed by radial diffusivity, has the potential to aid the prediction of delayed radiation necrosis, which could provide guidance in dose-escalation trials.",Excluded,0.04024925
2928,"Pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level is a risk factor for para-aortic lymph node recurrence in addition to squamous cell carcinoma antigen following definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. BACKGROUND: To identify pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels as a risk factor for para-aortic lymph node (PALN) recurrence following concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for cervical cancer., METHODS: From March 1995 to January 2008, 188 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the uterine cervix were analyzed retrospectively. No patient received PALN irradiation as the initial treatment. CEA and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) were measured before and after radiotherapy. PALN recurrence was detected by computer tomography (CT) scans. We analyzed the actuarial rates of PALN recurrence by using Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariate analyses were carried out with Cox regression models. We stratified the risk groups based on the hazard ratios (HR)., RESULTS: Both pretreatment CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL and SCC-Ag levels < 10 ng/mL (p < 0.001, HR = 8.838), SCC-Ag levels >= 40 ng/mL (p < 0.001, HR = 12.551), and SCC-Ag levels of 10-40 ng/mL (p < 0.001, HR = 4.2464) were significant factors for PALN recurrence. The corresponding 5-year PALN recurrence rates were 51.5%, 84.8%, and 27.5%, respectively. The 5-year PALN recurrence rate for patients with both low (< 10 ng/mL) SCC and CEA was only 9.6%. CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL or SCC-Ag levels >= 10 ng/mL at PALN recurrence were associated with overall survival after an isolated PALN recurrence. Pretreatment CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL were also associated with survival after an isolated PALN recurrence., CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment CEA >= 10 ng/mL is an additional risk factor of PALN relapse following definitive CCRT for SCC of the uterine cervix in patients with pretreatment SCC-Ag levels < 10 ng/mL. More comprehensive examinations before CCRT and intensive follow-up schedules are suggested for early detection and salvage in patients with SCC-Ag or CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL.",Excluded,0.041045435
2929,"'A comparative study using conventional concomitant chemoradiotherapy (using cisplatin-based chemotherapy) with accelerated (six fractions a week) chemoradiotherapy in inoperable or nonresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancers:' A prospective randomized trial. Context: The conventional concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Accelerated CCRT results in shortening of overall treatment time which can contribute in controlling accelerated tumor repopulation. The increase in tumor control probability (TCP) can be expected with no or little effect on late normal tissue injury for a given total dose. Aim(s): The aim of this study was to compare the disease response, toxicity profile, quality of life (QoL), and overall survival in accelerated versus conventional CCRT. Subjects and Methods: Total 42 patients were randomized into two groups - study group (n = 21): Accelerated CCRT, radiation was given as 6 fractions per week (60 Gy/5 weeks/30#) with injection cisplatin 20 mg/m2intravenous (iv) days 1-5 and days 29-33 + injection etoposide 50 mg/m2iv days 1-5 and days 29-33 and control group (n = 21): Conventional CCRT, radiation was given as 5 fractions per week (60 Gy/6 weeks/30#) along with the same chemotherapy. External beam radiation therapy was delivered by cobalt-60 machines. Result(s): The overall response rate (complete and partial response) for all patients was 66.6%. In the control group, it was 66.2%, and in the study group, it was 66.6%. Grade >=II pulmonary, hematological, and esophageal toxicities were seen in 57%, 43%, and 24% in patients of the control group and 53%, 53%, and 33% in the study group, respectively. In QoL analysis, maximum improvement was noted for hemoptysis, arm/shoulder pain, dyspnea, and chest pain in both the groups. Statistical Analysis Used: The data were analyzed by Student's t-test and Chi-square test. P < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Conclusion(s): As response rates and disease progression were similar in both the groups, accelerated chemoradiotherapy can be considered as an alternate therapy, especially in high-volume centers.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

2930,"Renal involvement in primary Sjogren's syndrome: a prospective cohort study. The objective of the study is to prospectively evaluate the spectrum of clinical and subclinical renal involvement in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS). Of the 174 patients screened, seventy patients with pSS underwent renal function tests, urine examination, renal ultrasound, arterial blood gases, urine pH followed by urine acidification test and renal biopsy (if indicated). Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) was treated with alkali replacement and moderate-severe tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) was treated with oral prednisolone. Sixty-two patients completed 1-year follow-up. A comparison was made between patients with and without renal involvement. Thirty-five (50%) patients had renal involvement. They had a lower baseline eGFR (71.85 +/- 18.04 vs. 83.8 +/- 17, p = 0.005). Twenty-nine patients had RTA (25 complete and 4 incomplete). Eleven patients had urinary abnormalities. Patients with RTA (n = 29) were younger (34.9 +/- 9 vs. 42 +/- 11.3, p = 0.006), had fewer articular (34% vs. 78%, p = 0.001) and ocular sicca (62% vs. 88%, P = 0.01) than those without RTA (n = 41) and commonly presented with hypokalemic paralysis. On biopsy, TIN (9/17) and IgA nephropathy (3/17) were most common. On follow-up, there was no clinically significant change in eGFR; however, one patient with renal calculi and incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) progressed to complete dRTA. Two patients treated with steroids had marginal improvement in eGFR. Renal involvement in pSS is under-recognized with the most common manifestation being RTA presenting with hypokalemic paralysis. These patients are younger with less articular and sicca symptoms. Subclinical RTA may progress to complete RTA. Renal biopsy should be considered in all patients with renal involvement.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded,0.038599797
2931,"EUS-guided portal pressure gradient measurement with a simple novel device: a human pilot study. Background and Aims Portal hypertension (PH) is a serious adverse event of liver cirrhosis. The hepatic venous pressure gradient or portal pressure gradient (PPG) accurately reflects the degree of PH and is the single best prognostic indicator in liver disease. This is usually obtained by interventional radiology (IR), although it is not routinely performed. Recently, we developed a simple novel technique for EUS-guided PPG measurement (PPGM). Our animal studies showed excellent correlation between EUS-PPGM and IR-PPGM. We present the first human pilot study of EUS-PPGM in patients with liver disease. Methods EUS-PPGM was performed by experienced endosonographers using a linear echoendoscope, a 25-gauge fine-needle aspiration needle, and a novel compact manometer. The portal vein and hepatic vein (or inferior vena cava) were targeted using a transgastric-transduodenal approach. Clinical parameters of PH were evaluated in each patient. Feasibility was defined as successful PPGM in each patient. Safety was based on adverse events captured in a postprocedural interview. Results Twenty-eight patients underwent EUS-PPGM with 100% technical success and no adverse events. PPG ranged from 1.5 to 19 mm Hg and had excellent correlation with clinical parameters of portal hypertension including the presence of varices (P = .0002), PH gastropathy (P = .007), and thrombocytopenia (P = .036). PPG was increased in patients with high clinical evidence of cirrhosis (P = .005). Conclusion This novel technique of EUS-PPGM using a 25-gauge needle and compact manometer is feasible and appears safe. Given the availability of EUS and the simplicity of the manometry setup, EUS-guided PPG may represent a promising breakthrough for procuring indispensable information in the management of patients with liver disease.Copyright © 2017",Excluded,0.03834384
2932,"Investigation of dosimetric variations of liver radiotherapy using deformable registration of planning CT and cone-beam CT. Many patients with technically unresectable or medically inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) had hepatic anatomy variations as a result of interfraction deformation during fractionated radiotherapy. We conducted this retrospective study to investigate interfractional normal liver dosimetric consequences via reconstructing weekly dose in HCC patients. Twenty-three patients with HCC received conventional fractionated three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) were enrolled in this retrospective investigation. Among them, seven patients had been diagnosed of radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) and the other 16 patients had good prognosis after treatment course. The cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans were acquired once weekly for each patient throughout the treatment, deformable image registration (DIR) of planning CT (pCT) and CBCT was performed to acquire modified CBCT (mCBCT), and the structural contours were propagated by the DIR. The same plan was applied to mCBCT to perform dose calculation. Weekly dose distribution was displayed on the pCT dose space and compared using dose difference, target coverage, and dose volume histograms. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the significant dosimetric variations. Among the 23 patients, the three weekly normal liver D50 increased by 0.2 Gy, 4.2 Gy, and 4.7 Gy, respectively, for patients with RILD, and 1.0 Gy, 2.7 Gy, and 3.1 Gy, respectively, for patients without RILD. Mean dose to the normal liver (Dmean) increased by 0.5 Gy, 2.6 Gy, and 4.0 Gy, respectively, for patients with RILD, and 0.4 Gy, 3.1 Gy, and 3.4 Gy, respectively, for patients without RILD. Regarding patients with RILD, the average values of the third weekly D50 and Dmean were both over hepatic radiation tolerance, while the values of patients without RILD were below. The dosimetric consequence showed that the liver dose between patients with and without RILD were different relative to the planned dose, and the RILD patients suffered from liver dose over hepatic radiation tolerance. Evaluation of routinely acquired CBCT images during radiation therapy provides biological information on the organs at risk, and dose estimation based on mCBCT could potentially form the basis for personalized response adaptive therapy.

2934,"Effect of extracellular pH on GABA-activated current in rat recombinant receptors and thin hypothalamic slices. We studied the effects of extracellular pH (pHo) on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated Cl- current in rat hypothalamic neurons and recombinant type-A GABA (GABA(A)) receptors stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293), using whole cell and outside-out patch-clamp recordings. In alpha3beta2gamma2s receptors, acidic pH decreased, whereas alkaline pH increased the response to GABA in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner. Acidification shifted the GABA concentration-response curve to the right, significantly increasing the EC50 for GABA without appreciably changing the slope or maximal current induced by GABA. We obtained similar effects of pH in alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors and in GABA-activated currents recorded from thin hypothalamic brain slices. In outside-out patches recorded from alpha3beta2gamma2 recombinant receptors, membrane patches were exposed to 5 microM GABA at control (7.3), acidic (6.4), or alkaline (8.4) pH. GABA activated main and subconductance states of 24 and 16 pS, respectively, in alpha3beta2gamma2 receptors. Alkaline pH(o) increased channel opening frequency and decreased the duration of the long closed state, resulting in an increase in open probability (from 0.0801 +/- 0.015 in pH 7.3 to 0.138 +/- 0.02 in pH 8.4). Exposure of the channels to acidic pH(o) had the opposite effects on open probability (decreased to 0.006 +/- 0.0001). Taken together, our results indicate that the function of GABA(A) receptors is modulated by extracellular pH. The proton effect is similar in recombinant and native receptors and is dependent on GABA concentration. In addition, the effect appears to be independent of the alpha-subunit isoform, and is due to the ability of H+ to alter the frequency of channel opening. Our findings indicate that GABAergic signaling in the CNS may be significantly altered during conditions that increase or decrease pH.",Excluded,0.047672447

PURPOSE: To report the outcome of ipsilateral radiation therapy (RT) in human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive (HPV+) patients and HPV-negative (HPV-) patients with T1-T2N0-N2b tonsillar cancer treated 25 years after our initial historical cohort., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with T1-T2N0-N2b tonsillar cancer who received ipsilateral RT or bilateral RT between 1999 and 2014 were reviewed. Overall survival (OS), local control (LC), regional control (RC), and grade 3 to 4 late toxicity (LT) were compared between ipsilateral RT and bilateral RT within HPV+ and HPV- patients, separately., RESULTS: HPV status was ascertained in 379/427 (88%) consecutive patients (ipsilateral RT: 62 HPV+, 34 HPV-; bilateral RT: 240 HPV+ 240, 41 HPV-). The proportion of ipsilateral RT by N category for HPV+ and HPV- patients were as follows: N0: 24/37 (65%) versus 28/48 (74%); N1: 21/49 (43%) versus 4/9 (44%); N2a: 10/39 (26%) versus 1/4 (25%); and N2b: 7/177 (4%) versus 1/24 (4%), respectively. Of the patients receiving ipsilateral RT, 94/96 (98%) were treated with RT alone. The median follow-up time was 5.03 years. The respective 5-year rates of OS, LC, RC, and LT were similar between ipsilateral RT and bilateral RT for the HPV+ patients (OS: 89% vs 87%, P=.55; LC: 97% vs 98%, P=.65; RC: 98% vs 97%, P=.27; LT: 17% vs 12%, P=.83) and HPV- patients (OS: 63% vs 48%, P=.27; LC: 90% vs 80%, P=.19; RC: 94% vs 83%, P=.14; LT: 15% vs 22%, P=.36). Of the 96 patients receiving ipsilateral RT, contralateral neck failure (CNF) occurred in 1/52 HPV+ patients and 1/34 HPV- patients. The 5-year CNF rates were 2% (95% CI: 1-9) (HPV+: 2% [0-14]; HPV-: 3% [0-21], P=.66). Five local failures (2 HPV+; 3 HPV-) and no distant failures were seen. The 5-year rates of LC, RC, and LT were 97% versus 90% (P=.24), 98% versus 94% (P=.25), and 18% versus 15% (P=.75) for the HPV+ and HPV- cohorts, respectively. Osteoradionecrosis occurred in 9 patients: 6/47 (13%) treated with conventional RT and 3/49 (6%) with intensity modulated RT (P=.32)., CONCLUSION: Ipsilateral radiation to selected patients with T1-T2N0-N2b tonsillar cancer results in equally excellent outcomes regardless of tumor HPV status.

2936,"Transradial and transulnar access for iliac artery interventions using sheathless guiding systems: A feasibility study. Purpose: Our aim was to evaluate the acute success and complication rates of the transradial and transulnar access for iliac artery stenting using sheathless guiding systems. Method(s): Clinical and angiographic data from 156 consecutive patients with symptomatic iliac artery stenosis who were treated with transradial or transulnar access were evaluated. All patients underwent Duplex ultrasound before and after the intervention. The primary endpoints were the procedural success rate, major adverse events, and access site complication rates. The secondary endpoints were the angiographic result of the iliac artery intervention, fluoroscopy time, X-ray dose, procedure length, crossover rate to another puncture site and hospitalization duration. The impact of the learning curve was also investigated, along with right or left radial access. Result(s): The indication for the intervention was intermittent claudication in 109 patients (69.9%), critical limb ischemia in 44 (28.2%) subjects and acute limb ischemia in three individuals (1.9%). Technical success was achieved in 155 patients (99.4%), with a crossover rate of 3.8%. Radial and ulnar artery access was used in 151 (96.8%) and 7 (4.5%) patients, respectively. The Ankle-brachial index increased from 0.69 [0.65-0.72] to 0.91 [0.88-0.95] as a result of the procedures (P < 0.001). The cumulative incidence of major adverse events was 3.8% at the 2-month follow-up (0% in patients with intermittent claudication and 13.8% in patients with critical limb ischemia). Radial artery access site complications were encountered in eight patients (5.1%). We documented decreased X-ray doses (1742.0 [783.9-2701] vs. 1435 [991.1-1879] vs. 692.8 [275.3-1110] Gy cm-2 P < 0.05) over time; however, the fluoroscopy time, procedure time, and contrast consumption were not significantly different. Left hand access was not associated with significantly better results than right radial artery access. Conclusion(s): Iliac artery stenting can be safely and effectively performed using radial or ulnar artery access and sheathless guiding catheters, with acceptable complication rates and high levels of technical success. The physician learning curve plays an important role in decreasing the X-ray dose. © 2016 The Authors.

2937,"Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome) is linked to chromosome 9q34. Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome [AOA]; MIM 208920) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and choreoathetosis. These neurological features resemble those of ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), but in AOA there are none of the extraneurological features of AT, such as immunodeficiency, neoplasia, chromosomal instability, or sensitivity to ionizing radiation. It is unclear whether these patients have a true disorder of chromosomal instability or a primary neurodegenerative syndrome, and it has not been possible to identify the defective gene in AOA, since the families have been too small for linkage analysis. We have identified a new family with AOA, and we show that the patients have no evidence of chromosomal instability or sensitivity to ionizing radiation, suggesting that AOA in this family is a true primary cerebellar ataxia. We have localized the disease gene, by linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping, to a 15.9-cM interval on chromosome 9q34. This work will ultimately allow the disease gene to be identified and its relevance to other types of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias to be determined.",Excluded,0.66890895

2940,"Laboratory longevity and competitiveness of Dacus ciliatus Loew (Diptera: Tephritidae) following sub-sterilizing gamma irradiation. The effect of a sub-sterilizing gamma radiation dose on Dacus ciliatus adults was investigated to assess the suitability of the sterile insect technique (SIT) as an alternative method to control this pest. Late pupae (48 h prior to adult emergence) from a laboratory strain were irradiated with 120 Gy of gamma rays emitted by a 60Co source. Following adult emergence, the mortality of irradiated and non-irradiated cohorts was recorded. Over a period of 50 days after emergence, no significant negative effects of irradiation upon the longevity of male or female laboratory flies were observed. A laboratory competitiveness study (Fried test), using irradiated laboratory and wild males at a ratio of 3:1 was conducted to assess the ability of irradiated males to reduce the egg hatch rates of a wild population. The overall competitiveness was found to be ca. 0.32, suggesting a reduced, but satisfactory, quality of irradiated laboratory as compared with wild males. Based on the above findings, we calculated and proposed effective male release ratios for field application of SIT against D. ciliatus.",Excluded,0.9517056
2941,"Effect of cranial irradiation on hypothalamus and pituitary functions. Hypopituitarism can occur after cranial irradiation for tumors distant from the pituitary gland. Recent studies have suggested that this is hypothalamic in origin. Hypothalamic and pituitary functions were studied in 11 patients, 4 men and 7 women, 4.5 years or more after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinomas. The estimated average total dose was 5000 cGys for the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Except for 2 women with amenorrhea and 4 men with impotency, the patients did not have evident endocrine deficiency. Baseline hormone profiles revealed normal T4, T3 and cortisol levels, 6 with elevated prolactin, 3 with reduced testosterone and 3 with slightly elevated basal TSH. The four menopausal women had impaired gonadotropin response to LHRH (100 micrograms, i.v.). Four (1 menstruating, 1 amenorrheic, 2 menopausal) women did not reach peak FSH response 4 hours after LHRH injection. The other amenorrheic woman had minimal FSH and LH response to LHRH which persisted even after 8 days of pulsatile infusion of LHRH (1 microgram/90min). TSH response to TRH (400 micrograms, i.v.) was delayed in 7 patients. GH response to human GRH (1 microgram/kg, i.v.) was impaired in 6 patients (maximal GH less than 5 mU/l). ACTH response to ovine CRH (1 microgram/kg, i.v.) was impaired in 3 patients (less than 50% elevation from baseline). Three patients who had normal GRH tests had impaired GH response to insulin hypoglycemia. Six patients had an empty sella on CT scan. From this study the following conclusions are drawn: (1) Among the four axes, GH is the most vulnerable. (2) The insulin tolerance test is still the best single test for evaluation of hypothalamic function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded,0.046873547
2942,"Physiological reconstruction of the spine using dorsal correction spondylodesis in Scheuermann's disease - A retrospective analysis of 73 prospectively recorded cases. Introduction: Posterior spinal fusion (PSF) and correction is the most frequently performed surgery in Scheuermann-associated hyperkyphosis. The aim of the study was to assess the extent of kyphosis correction, complications and clinical outcome after PSF. Material/Methods: Between 2014 and 2018, 73 patients with Scheuermann associated hyperkyphosis underwent surgery, were prospectively recorded and retrospectively analyzed. X-rays of the whole spine were analyzed pre- and postoperative as well as after 6, 12 and 24 months. Sagittal and coronary Cobb angles, pelvic parameters and sagittal profile were evaluated using a web-based analysis tool. Operation duration, complications, and blood loss were compared. Postoperatively, the clinical outcome was determined using standardized questionnaires (SRS22, EQ 5D) after 3, 12 and 24 months. Result(s): Thoracic structural kyphosis (UEV-LEV) was preoperatively measured with 75.11degree with a correction to 48.54degree (p<0.001). The Stagnara angles had an extent of 68.87degree with a correction to 38.68degree (p<0.001). Compensatory lumbar lordosis (LL) showed a correction from 68.24degree to 46.70degree (p<0.001). Using the highly negative pelvic incidence (PI) - LL mismatch (PI-LL pre-OP - 23.6 to PI-LL post-OP -1.3; p<0.001) we demonstrated significant compensatory hyperlordosis pre-OP with good spontaneous correction post-OP. The number of fused segments (11.2) correlated significantly with the degree of kyphosis (p<0.005) and kyphosis correction (p<0.001). The pelvic parameters (PI, pelvic tilt, sacral slope) were physiologically preoperatively and without changes in the follow-up X-rays. The most frequently uppermost and lowest instrumented vertebra was T2 (33 patients, 45.2%) and L3 (29 patients, 39.7%), respectively. Number of fused segments correlated significantly with surgery duration (mean 263.73 min, p=0.012) and blood loss (mean 750.56 ml, p=0.016). The initial degree of kyphosis showed significant correlation with the SRS mental health subscore(p=0.043). The degree of kyphosis had no influence on the other subscores and on the total SRS 22. Furthermore, the clinical outcome showed a gradual and significant improvement of SRS 22 and EQ 5D after 3 and 12 months. Postoperatively we recorded the following complications: neurological complication without neurological deficit (3.2%), implant-associated complication (6.3%) and wound healing issues (3.2%). Discussion(s): Using PSF we corrected the thoracic hyperkyphosis of M. Scheuermann from 75degree to 48degree and the lumbar hyperlordosis from 68degree to 47degree. We could achieve an almost physiological reconstruction of the sagittal alignment. The first clinical followup results were convincing with a significant improvement of SRS 22 and the EQ 5D already after 3 months. Complication rates were moderate (14.2%) and the risk of proximal junctional kyphosis with sufficiently long instrumentation after PSF alone is rare with 1.6% of cases.",Excluded,0.038094193
2943,"A tactile display for International Space Station (ISS) extravehicular activity (EVA). Background: A tactile display to increase an astronaut's situational awareness during an extravehicular activity (EVA) has been developed and ground tested. The Tactor Locator System (TLS) is a non-intrusive, intuitive display capable of conveying position and velocity information via a vibrotactile stimulus applied to the subject's neck and torso. In the Earth's 1 G environment, perception of position and velocity is determined by the body's individual sensory systems. Under normal sensory conditions, redundant information from these sensory systems provides humans with an accurate sense of their position and motion. However, altered environments, including exposure to weightlessness, can lead to conflicting visual and vestibular cues, resulting in decreased situational awareness. The TLS was designed to provide somatosensory cues to complement the visual system during EVA operations. Method(s): An EVA task was simulated on a computer graphics workstation with a display of the International Space Station (ISS) and a target astronaut at an unknown location. Subjects were required to move about the ISS and acquire the target astronaut using either an auditory cue at the outset, or the TLS. Subjects used a 6 degree of freedom input device to command translational and rotational motion. The TLS was configured to act as a position aid, providing target direction information to the subject through a localized stimulus. Result(s): Results show that the TLS decreases reaction time (p = 0.001) and movement time (p = 0.001) for simulated subject (astronaut) motion around the ISS. Conclusion(s): The TLS is a useful aid in increasing an astronaut's situational awareness, and warrants further testing to explore other uses, tasks and configurations.",Excluded,0.038641855
2944,"Oncogenic N-Ras Mitigates Oxidative Stress-Induced Apoptosis of Hematopoietic Stem Cells. Leukemic relapse is believed to be driven by transformed hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that harbor oncogenic mutations or have lost tumor suppressor function. Recent comprehensive sequencing studies have shown that mutations predicted to activate Ras signaling are highly prevalent in hematologic malignancies and, notably, in refractory and relapsed cases. To better understand what drives this clinical phenomenon, we expressed oncogenic NrasG12D within the hematopoietic system in mice and interrogated its effects on HSC survival. N-RasG12D conferred a survival benefit to HSCs and progenitors following metabolic and genotoxic stress. This effect was limited to HSCs and early progenitors and was independent of autophagy and cell proliferation. N-RasG12D-mediated HSC survival was not affected by inhibition of canonical Ras effectors such as MEK and PI3K. However, inhibition of the noncanonical Ras effector pathway protein kinase C (PKC) ameliorated the protective effects of N-RasG12D. Mechanistically, N-RasG12D lowered levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which correlated with reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels. Inhibition of PKC restored the levels of ROS to that of control HSCs and abrogated the protective effects granted by N-RasG12D. Thus, N-RasG12D activation within HSCs promotes cell survival through the mitigation of ROS, and targeting this mechanism may represent a viable strategy to induce apoptosis during malignant transformation of HSCs. SIGNIFICANCE: Targeting oncogenic N-Ras-mediated reduction of ROS in hematopoietic stem cells through inhibition of the noncanonical Ras effector PKC may serve as a novel strategy for treatment of leukemia and other Ras-mutated cancers.

2945,"Intensity modulated radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy for larynx preservation of advanced resectable hypopharyngeal cancer. BACKGROUND: To analyze the rate of larynx preservation in patients of locally advanced hypopharyngeal cancer treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plus concurrent chemotherapy, and compare the results with patients treated with primary surgery., METHODS: Between January 2003 and November 2007, 14 patients were treated with primary surgery and 33 patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) using IMRT technique. Survival rate, larynx preservation rate were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was conducted for significant prognostic factors with Cox-regression method., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 19.4 months for all patients, and 25.8 months for those alive. The 5-year overall survival rate was 33% and 44% for primary surgery and definitive CCRT, respectively (p = 0.788). The 5-year functional larynx-preservation survival after IMRT was 40%. Acute toxicities were common, but usually tolerable. The rates of treatment-related mucositis (> or = grade 2) and pharyngitis (> or = grade 3) were higher in the CCRT group. For multivariate analysis, treatment response and cricoid cartilage invasion strongly correlated with survival., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT plus concurrent chemotherapy may preserve the larynx without compromising survival. Further studies on new effective therapeutic agents are essential.",Excluded,0.03833838
2946,"Developmental defects and male sterility in mice lacking the ubiquitin-like DNA repair gene mHR23B. mHR23B encodes one of the two mammalian homologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD23, a ubiquitin-like fusion protein involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Part of mHR23B is complexed with the XPC protein, and this heterodimer functions as the main damage detector and initiator of global genome NER. While XPC defects exist in humans and mice, mutations for mHR23A and mHR23B are not known. Here, we present a mouse model for mHR23B. Unlike XPC-deficient cells, mHR23B(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts are not UV sensitive and retain the repair characteristics of wild-type cells. In agreement with the results of in vitro repair studies, this indicates that mHR23A can functionally replace mHR23B in NER. Unexpectedly, mHR23B(-/-) mice show impaired embryonic development and a high rate (90%) of intrauterine or neonatal death. Surviving animals display a variety of abnormalities, including retarded growth, facial dysmorphology, and male sterility. Such abnormalities are not observed in XPC and other NER-deficient mouse mutants and point to a separate function of mHR23B in development. This function may involve regulation of protein stability via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and is not or only in part compensated for by mHR23A.",Excluded,0.06354986
2947,"Efficacy analysis of pedicle screw internal fixation of fractured vertebrae in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures. The present study aimed to discuss the method and effect of posterior internal fixation of thoracolumbar fractures strengthened by the vertical stress pedicle screw fixation of fractured vertebrae. Patients with single thoracolumbar fractures were examined retrospectively. Fourteen patients (group A) had been treated with vertical stress pedicle screw fixation of a fractured vertebra and sixteen patients (group B) received traditional double-plate fixation, as a control. All patients were diagnosed with fresh fractures with a complete unilateral or bilateral pedicle and no explosion of the inferior half of the vertebral body or inferior endplate. In group A, patients received conventional posterior distraction and lumbar lordosis restoration, as well as pedicle screws in the fractured vertebra in a vertical direction to relieve stress to achieve a local stress balance. All patients were followed up postoperatively for 4-18 months (average, 12.6 months). The vertical stress pedicle screw fixation assisted in the reduction of vertebrae fracture, which reduced the postoperative Cobb's angle loss. There was a significant difference in the change of Cobb's angle between the two groups one year after surgery (P<0.01). Conditional application of pedicle screws in a single thoracolumbar fracture enhances the stability of the internal fixation system and is conducive to the correction of kyphosis and maintenance of the corrective effects.",Excluded,0.0382516
2948,"Monte Carlo based estimation of organ and effective doses to patients undergoing hysterosalpingography and retrograde urethrography fluoroscopy procedures. Contrast investigations of hysterosalpingography (HSG) and retrograde urethrography (RUG) fluoroscopy procedures remain the dominant diagnostic tools for the investigation of infertility in females and urethral strictures in males, respectively, owing to the scarcity and high cost of services of alternative diagnostic technologies. In light of the radiological risks associated with contrast based investigations of the genitourinary tract systems, there is a need to assess the magnitude of radiation burden imparted to patients undergoing HSG and RUG fluoroscopy procedures in Tanzania. The air kerma area product (KAP), fluoroscopy time, number of images, organ dose and effective dose to patients undergoing HSG and RUG procedures were obtained from four hospitals. The KAP was measured using a flat transmission ionization chamber, while the organ and effective doses were estimated using the knowledge of the patient characteristics, patient related exposure parameters, geometry of examination, KAP and Monte Carlo calculations (PCXMC). The median values of KAP for the HSG and RUG were 2.2 Gy cm2 and 3.3 Gy cm2, respectively. The median organ doses in the present study for the ovaries, urinary bladder and uterus for the HSG procedures, were 1.0 mGy, 4.0 mGy and 1.6 mGy, respectively, while for urinary bladder and testes of the RUG were 3.4 mGy and 5.9 mGy, respectively. The median values of effective doses for the HSG and RUG procedures were 0.65 mSv and 0.59 mSv, respectively. The median values of effective dose per hospital for the HSG and RUG procedures had a range of 1.6-2.8 mSv and 1.9-5.6 mSv, respectively, while the overall differences between individual effective doses across the four hospitals varied by factors of up to 22.0 and 46.7, respectively for the HSG and RUG procedures. The proposed diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for the HSG and RUG were for KAP 2.8 Gy cm2 and 3.9 Gy cm2, for fluoroscopy time 0.8 min and 0.9 min, and for number of images 5 and 4, respectively. The suggested DRLs for the HSG and RUG procedures may be used by the radiology departments in Tanzania for management of attained dose levels until the national DRLs are established.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded,0.038730867

Background: To compare low-dose abdominal computed tomography (LDCT) with plain abdominal radiography (AR) in the primary investigation of acute abdominal pain to determine if there is a difference in diagnostic yield, the number of additional investigations required and hospital length of stay (LOS). Method(s): This randomized controlled trial was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained. Patients presenting to the emergency department with an acute abdomen and who would normally be investigated with AR were randomized to either AR or LDCT. The estimated radiation dose of the LDCT protocol was 2-3mSv compared to 1.1mSv for AR. Pearson's chi-square and the independent samples t-test were used for the statistical analysis. Result(s): A total of 142 patients were eligible, and after exclusions and omitting those with incomplete data, 55 patients remained for analysis in the AR arm and 53 in the LDCT arm. A diagnosis could be obtained in 12 (21.8%) patients investigated with AR compared to 34 (64.2%) for LDCT (P < 0.001). Twenty-eight (50.9%) patients in the AR group required further imaging during their admission compared to 14 (26.4%) in the LDCT group (P= 0.009). There was no difference in the median hospital LOS (3.84 days for AR versus 4.24 days for LDCT, P= 0.83). Conclusion(s): LDCT demonstrates a superior diagnostic yield over AR and reduces the number of subsequent imaging tests for a minimal cost in radiation exposure.

2950,"Assessment of ureteric colic in irish emergency departments-how do we compare with the gold standard?. Ureteric colic describes the spasmodic pain that arises from obstruction of the ureter by a calculus. It is a common presentation in the Emergency Department (ED) with a lifetime risk of 12 % in men and 5 % in women with an incidence of 3/1000 population per year [1]. Prompt assessment and diagnosis is important as infection in the presence of obstruction is a surgical emergency. The aim of this study is to ascertain the work-up of ureteric colic in Irish EDs and compare these to the agreed gold-standard. An electronic survey was distributed to Consultants and Specialist Registrars in Emergency Medicine. Hospital demographics and presence of a urology service within the hospital were also recorded. Out of 63 responses, 66 % were Consultants and 27.4 % were Specialist Registrars in Emergency Medicine. All HSE training networks were represented. 62.9 % had established guidelines for ureteric colic in their ED. While FBC, U&E, and urine dipstick were routinely performed, metabolic profile and mid-stream urine was only performed 31 and 39 % of the time, respectively. 88.5 % of physicians agree that CT KUB should be the first-line imaging however, only 65 % of EDs actually do this, with X-ray KUB representing 36.5 % of initial imaging. The recommended analgesic-NSAIDs, are prescribed 61.9 % versus morphine, 69.8 % of the time.

2951,"DW-MRI-guided dose escalation improves local control of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with chemoradiotherapy. Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most highly radiosensitive malignancies; however, some locally advanced NPC patients experienced local recurrence even though they received aggressive treatment regimens. Defining the tumor volume precisely is important to escalate the total dose required for the primary tumor. In this study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of dose escalation guided by DW-MRI in patients with locally advanced NPC. Patients and Methods: A total of 230 patients with locally advanced NPC treated with intensive modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) at Sichuan Cancer Hospital between January 2010 and January 2015 were enrolled in this retrospective study. All the patients were treated with all-course of simultaneous integrated boost-IMRT. DW-MRI-guided dose escalation with 2.2-2.5 Gy/F, qd for 1-3daysor1.2-1.5 Gy/F, bid for 1-3 days were prescribed to 123 patients. Survival and complication of the patients were evaluated, and multivariate analysis was performed. Result(s): The median follow-up of patients in the DW-MRI-guided dose-escalation group and the conventional group was 48 months (range 8-88 months) and 52 months (range 6-90 months), respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate, distant metastasis-free survival rate, progression-free survival, and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) of patients in the dose-escalation group and the conventional group were 88% vs 82.5% (p = 0.244), 86.1% vs 83.3% (p = 0.741), 82.2% vs 76.6% (p = 0.286), and 89.1% vs 80.1% (p = 0.029), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that dose escalation was independent prognostic factor for LRFS (HR 0.386, 95% CI 0.163-0.909, p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): DW-MRI-guided dose escalation is a feasible strategy to improve local control of patients with locally advanced NPC. The treatment-related complications are tolerable.Copyright © 2020 Huang et al.",Excluded,0.038327824

2954,"Investigation of PKC isoform-specific translocation and targeting of the current of the late afterhyperpolarizing potential of myenteric AH neurons. AH neurons in the enteric nervous system play an essential role in initiating intestinal reflexes and factors that control AH neuron excitability therefore influence the state of the digestive system. Prominent afterhyperpolarizations that follow action potentials in these neurons strongly affect their excitability. In the present work, we have investigated the regulation of the afterhyperpolarizing current (I(AHP)) by protein kinase C (PKC). Electrophysiological responses and protein translocation were investigated in AH neurons of freshly dissected preparations of myenteric ganglia from the guinea-pig ileum. The activator of conventional and novel PKCs, phorbol dibutyrate, but not the activator of novel PKCs, ingenol, blocked the I(AHP). Phorbol dibutyrate had no effect on the hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) or on the A current (I(A)). Stimulation of synaptic inputs to the neurons also reduced the I(AHP), and had no effect on I(h) or I(A). Phorbol dibutyrate also reduced a background outward current that was present after the I(AHP) current had been blocked by clotrimazole. Both phorbol dibutyrate and ingenol caused translocation of the novel PKC, PKCepsilon, in these neurons. Only phorbol dibutyrate caused translocation of PKCgamma, a conventional PKC. The studies thus indicate that the activation of PKC by phorbol esters and by nerve stimulation affects AH neurons in a similar way, and that PKC activation targets both the I(AHP) and another background K(+) current. The I(AHP) is targeted by a conventional PKC, suggested to be PKCgamma, as this is the only conventional PKC that is prominent in AH neurons.",Excluded,0.03890813
2955,"A propensity-score matching analysis comparing long-term survival of surgery alone and postoperative treatment for patients in node positive or stage III esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after R0 esophagectomy. Background: Surveillance was recommended for patients after R0 esophagectomy by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. However, local failure was high in locally advanced patients (48-78%). The present study aimed to determine whether adjuvant treatment improved survival for stage IIb-III thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (TESCC). Method(s): A retrospective review of patients diagnosed as esophageal carcinoma at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Cancer hospital, between January 2004 and December 2011, was performed. A database compiling 975 patents with node positive or stage III thoracic esophageal carcinoma after R0 surgery with or without postoperative radiation/chemoradiation was created. A 1:1 matched study group was generated by the Greedy method after propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. Survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Result(s): 975 patients were enrolled in the study, 510 patients (52.3%) did not receive any postoperative treatment after R0 surgery and 465 patients had either postoperative chemoradiation or radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 69.2 months. After PSM, 222 well-balanced patients in each group demonstrated the same results. The 3-year, 5-year survival rates and median survival in surgery group (33.0%, 26.4%, 24.3 months) were inferior to those in postoperative treatment group (48.3%, 37.1% and 34.3 months), (P = 0.002). Compared with radiotherapy, postoperative chemoradiation did not improve DFS and OS (P = 0.692; P = 0.368). N stage and adjuvant treatment are independent prognostic factors. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant treatment could improve survival for patients with stage IIb-III TESCC.Copyright © 2019",Excluded,0.18013239
2956,"CT-Guided Microcoil Localization of Small Peripheral Pulmonary Nodules to Direct Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Resection without the Aid of Intraoperative Fluoroscopy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of CT-guided microcoil localization of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) for guiding video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 2016 and October 2019, 454 consecutive patients with 501 SPNs who received CT-guided microcoil localization before VATS in our institution were enrolled. The diameter of the nodules was 0.93 +/- 0.49 cm, and the shortest distance from the nodules to the pleura was 1.41 +/- 0.95 cm. The distal end of the microcoil was placed less than 1 cm away from the nodule, and the proximal end was placed outside the visceral pleura. VATS was performed under the guidance of implanted microcoils without the aid of intraoperative fluoroscopy. RESULT(S): All 501 nodules were marked with microcoils. The time required for microcoil localization was 12.8 +/- 5.2 minutes. Microcoil localization-related complications occurred in 179 cases (39.4%). None of the complications required treatment. A total of 463 nodules were successfully resected under the guidance of implanted microcoils. VATS revealed 38 patients with dislocated microcoils, of which 28 underwent wedge resection (21 cases under the guidance of the bleeding points of pleural puncture, 7 cases through palpation), 5 underwent direct lobectomy, and the remaining 5 underwent a conversion to thoracotomy. In 4 cases, a portion of the microcoil remained in the lung parenchyma. CONCLUSION(S): CT-guided microcoil localization of SPNs is safe and reliable. Marking the nodule and pleura simultaneously with microcoils can effectively guide the resection of SPNs using VATS without the aid of intraoperative fluoroscopy.Copyright © 2021 The Korean Society of Radiology.",Excluded,0.03859865
2957,"Alternative means of estimating maximum permissible activity of I-131 administered to treat thyroid cancer. Objectives Maximum permissible activity (MPA) of I-131 to be administered to treat thyroid cancer traditionally combines 2 dose components & requires 5 days of repeatedly measuring whole body gamma radiation with an Anger camera & blood processing. The objective of our study was to determine whether the 2 dose components are sufficiently well correlated to enable estimating total dose from blood work alone. Methods Data were examined retrospectively for all pts studied from 2004 - 2015. An uncollimated gamma camera measured anterior & posterior counts (corrected for background & decay & calibrated by I-131 standards) 6 times over 5 days after administration of 37-74 MBq I-131 to estimate dose to blood from gamma emissions (Dgamma). Blood was sampled within 10 min of each camera measurement, well counter counts of which estimated dose to blood from beta emissions (Dbeta). Adding these 2 estimates provided total dose (DT) to blood forming organs, adjusted for body habitus. Predicted total dose (DP) was obtained from Dbeta alone by linear regression. Conventional MPA was computed as 200 rad/DT & predicted MPA as 200 rad/DP. Results There were 62 pts (age = 61+/-12 yrs; 30 female; 32 male), of whom 2 were studied twice & 3 were studied 3 times, for a total of 68 measurements. DT was progressively larger for pts studied multiple times (rank correlation rho = 0.39, p = 0.004). DP was computed as = -0.005+1.473* Dbeta, & correlated strongly with DT (r = 0.98, p < 0.0001; intercept = 0.04+/-0.02, p = 0.09; slope = 0.95+/-0.02, p < 0.0001), with similar means (0.76+/-0.51 versus 0.76+/-0.52 rad/mCi, paired t-test p = 0.96). Predicted & conventional total doses were similar for pts studied once (0.69+/-0.41 versus 0.68+/-0.42 rad/mCi, p = 0.72), twice (1.06+/-0.69 versus 1.11+/-0.64 rad/mCi, p = 0.39), & 3 times (1.25+/-0.59 versus 1.26+/-0.62 rad/mCi, p = 0.87). Predicted MPA correlated strongly with actual MPA (r = 0.99, p < 0.0001), with similar means (385+/-230 versus 394+/-244 mCi, p = 0.11). Conclusions Similar results are obtained whether uncollimated camera measurements are obtained directly or are estimated based on blood measurements. (Figure Presented).",Excluded,0.07898986
2958,"Comparison of multidetector computed tomography angiography and cholangiography performed at 80 and 120 kvp in live liver donors. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the radiation exposure and image quality of contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography angiography (CTA) and computed tomography cholangiography (CTC) performed for living liver donor evaluation using 80 and 120 kVp. METHOD(S): Ninety-three potential liver donors who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced 64 multidetector CTA and CTC were retrospectively divided into 2 groups: at 80 and at 120 kVp. An institutional review board waiver was obtained. Signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of the hepatic artery and common bile duct were obtained. The dose-length product was recorded. Image quality and visibility of hepatic artery and biliary tract anatomy were evaluated. Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical evaluation. RESULT(S): Mean hepatic artery/common bile duct signal-to-noise ratio was 28.9/28.6 (SD, 14.2/10.0) at 80 kVp and 27.6/25.8 (SD, 8.0/6.2) at 120 kVp (P = 0.61/0.099). Mean hepatic artery/common bile duct contrast-to-noise ratio was 24.8/23.3 (SD, 12.9/8.6) at 80 kVp and 22.2/19.3 (SD, 7.7/5.0) at 120 kVp (P = 0.76/0.005). Mean CTA/CTC dose-length product was 279/281 (SD, 42/52) mGy-cm at 80 kVp and 407/451 (SD, 208/243) mGy-cm at 120 kVp (P = 0.026/0.002). Computed tomography cholangiography image quality and visibility of biliary tract anatomy were not significantly different at 80 versus 120 kVp (all P > 0.13). Computed tomography angiography image quality was significantly lower (P < 0.01), and the noise scores significantly higher (P < 0.01) at 80 versus 120 kVp, but diagnostic. CONCLUSION(S): Contrast-enhanced CTA and CTC performed at 80 kVp result in comparable image quality and anatomical evaluation with reduced radiation exposure when compared with 120 kVp.

2960,"Three-dimensional analysis of recurrence patterns in rectal cancer: The cranial border in hypofractionated preoperative radiotherapy can be lowered. Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine whether and where the radiotherapy (RT) clinical target volume (CTV) could be reduced in short-course preoperative treatment of rectal cancer patients. Methods and Materials: Patients treated in the Dutch total mesorectal excision trial, with a local recurrence were analyzed. For 94 (25 who underwent radiation therapy 69 who did not) of 114 patients with a local recurrence, the location of the recurrence was placed in a three-dimensionalthree (3D) model. The data in the 3D model were correlated to the clinical trial data to distinguish a group of patients eligible for CTV reduction. Effects of CTV reduction on dose to the small bowel was tested retrospectively in a dataset of 8 patients with three-field conformal plans and intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). Result(s): The use of preoperative RT mainly reduces anastomotic, lateral, and perineal recurrences. In patients without primary nodal involvement, no recurrences were found cranially of the S2-S3 interspace, irrespective of the delivery of RT. In patients without primary nodal involvement and a negative circumferential resection margin (CRM), only one recurrence was found cranial to the S2-S3 interspace. With a cranially reduced CTV to the S2-S3 interspace, over 60% reduction in absolute small bowel exposure at dose levels from 15 to 35 Gy could be achieved with three-field conventional RT, increasing to 80% when IMRT is also added. Conclusion(s): The cranial border of the CTV can safely be lowered for patients without expected nodal or CRM involvement, yielding a significant reduction of dose to the small bowel. Therefore, a significant reduction of acute and late toxicity can be expected. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.038709216
2961,"Control of growth of vestibular schwannomas with low-dose Gamma Knife surgery. OBJECT: The treatment of solitary vestibular schwannomas by performing Gamma Knife surgery is well established. It has been reported that decreasing the surface dose reduces patient morbidity, especially facial weakness and numbness. The authors of this retrospective study examine patient data from a single center to determine if low-dose ( 14 Gy). METHOD(S): Based on the formula for ellipsoid volumes, the tumor volumes were calculated using measurements from MR images obtained at follow up in patients treated at the authors' center. Follow-up data were available in 159 patients with a mean age of 59.5 +/- 14.2 years at treatment. Fifty-six percent of the patients were women and 53.5% of the tumors were located on the right side of the brain. The mean tumor volume was 3.3 +/- 4.3 cm3 with 10% of the tumors having volumes larger than 8 cm3. After GKS, smaller tumors (> or = 40% decrease in volume) were observed in 44.8% of patients treated with a low dose and in 48.8% treated with a high dose. Enlarged tumors (> or = 40% increase in volume) were seen in 5.2% of the patients receiving a low dose and 2.3% of those receiving a high dose. These differences were not statistically significant. Patients who had been followed up for longer than 5 years after treatment had median residual volumes of only 28.2% of the starting volume in the low-dose group and 26% in the high-dose group. This difference was statistically not significant. CONCLUSION(S): No statistically significant differences were observed between tumors given low-dose radiation treatment and those given high-dose radiation treatment.",Excluded,0.10969334
2962,"Ultrasound Guidance Reduces Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Cost Compared to Fluoroscopy. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost factors associated with ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and to determine which method can be performed at a lower cost per case., METHODS: A cost comparison study was performed utilizing clinical data from a prospectively maintained research database. We included the most recent 33 consecutive ultrasound-guided PCNL cases in 2016 and the most recent 40 consecutive fluoroscopy-guided PCNL cases before the operative surgeon transitioned to ultrasound guidance in May 2014. The total operative time and clinical outcomes were examined. Costs were extracted from the institution accounting systems and given a uniform multiplier to protect institutional financial reporting confidentiality. Comparisons were made using the Student t test and the chi-squared test., RESULTS: After excluding outliers, 71 PCNL procedures were included in the analysis. Demographic data and stone characteristics were not different between ultrasound-guided and fluoroscopy-guided groups. However, the mean operative time for ultrasound-guided PCNL was significantly shorter (99.8 +/- 27.0 vs 144.9 +/- 55.1 minutes, P < .05). When capital equipment costs were included, the mean total cost per case of ultrasound-guided PCNL was approximately 30% less than fluoroscopy-guided PCNL (simulated costs with a uniform multiplier; $5258.90 +/- 957.12 vs $7508.60 +/- 1163.83, P < .05). Postoperative clinical outcomes were comparable between the 2 groups., CONCLUSION: When capital costs are included, ultrasound-guided PCNL can produce comparable clinical outcomes to fluoroscopy-guided procedures at a lower cost to the institution. Shorter operative time drives significant savings with the adoption of ultrasound guidance, which may be magnified with increasing case volume. Using ultrasound imaging during PCNL may be more cost-effective compared to fluoroscopy and warrants further study. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.038607553

2964,"Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for the Management of Liver Metastases from Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: A Preliminary Study. INTRODUCTION: Liver metastases are common in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms. The role of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is not well understood in this population. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SABR in treating well-differentiated neuroendocrine liver metastases (WD-NELM). METHOD(S): A retrospective review of patients with WD-NELM treated with SABR between January 2015-July 2019. Demographic, treatment and clinical/radiographic follow-up data were abstracted. RECIST 1.1 criteria were applied to each individual target to evaluate the response to treatment. Local control (LC) and progression free survival (PFS) were determined using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Toxicity was reported according to CTCAE v5.0. RESULT(S): Twenty-five patients with a total of 53 liver metastases treated with SABR were identified. Most patients (68%) had midgut tumors, were Grade II (80%) and had high volume intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic disease (76%). Median number of liver metastases treated was 2 with a median size of 2.5 cm. Median radiation dose delivered was 50Gy/5 fractions. Median follow-up was 14 months; 24 of the 25 patients were alive at time of analysis. The objective response rate (ORR) was 32%, with improvement or stability in 96% of lesions treated. The median time to best response was 9 months. The 1-year LC and PFS were 92% and 44% respectively. No Grade III/IV acute or late toxicity was identified. CONCLUSION(S): Liver SABR is a safe and promising means of providing local control for WD-NELM. This treatment modality should be evaluated in select patients in concert with strategies to manage systemic disease.Copyright © 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded,0.03839342
2965,"Characterization of biological peculiarities of the radioprotective activity of double-stranded RNA isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The purpose of the article: Protection from ionizing radiation is the most important component in the curing malignant neoplasms, servicing atomic reactors, and resolving the situations associated with uncontrolled radioactive pollutions. In this regard, discovering new effective radioprotectors as well as novel principles of protecting living organisms from high-dose radiation is the most important factor, determining the new approaches in medical and technical usage of radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Experimental animals were irradiated on the gamma-emitter (Cs137) with a dose of 9.4 Gy. Radioprotective properties of several agents (total RNA, single-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA and B-190) were estimated by the survival/death rates of experimental animals within 30-90 d. Pathomorphological examination of internal organs end electron microscope assay was done on days 9-12 after irradiation. Cloning and other molecular procedures were performed accordingly to commonly accepted protocols. For assessment of the internalization of labeled nucleic acid, bone marrow cells were incubated with double-stranded RNA labeled with 6-FAM fluorescent dye. Cells with internalized double-stranded RNA were assayed using Axio Imager M1 microscope. In the other experiment, bone marrow cells after incubation with double-stranded RNA were stained with Cy5-labeled anti-CD34 antibodies and assayed using Axioskop 2 microscope. Result(s): In this study, several biological features of the radioprotective action of double-stranded RNA are characterized. It was shown that 160 microg of the double-stranded RNA per mouse protect experimental animals from the absolutely lethal dose of gamma-radiation of 9.4 Gy. In different experiments, 80-100% of irradiated animals survive and live until their natural death. Radioprotective properties of double-stranded RNA were found to be independent on its sequence, but strictly dependent on its double-stranded form. Moreover, double-stranded RNA must have 'open' ends of the molecule to exert its radioprotective activity. Conclusion(s): Experiments indicate that radioprotective effect of double-stranded RNA is tightly bound to its internalization into hematopoietic stem cells, which further repopulate the spleen parenchyma of irradiated mice. Actively proliferating progenitors form the splenic colonies, which further serve as the basis for restoration of hematopoiesis and immune function and determine the survival of animals received the lethal dose of radiation.© Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded,0.97060174

PURPOSE: To identify, using tissue microarray (TMA), an immunohistochemical panel predictive of response to ionizing radiation (IR) in rectal cancer., METHODS: TMA constructs were prepared from archived stage II/III rectal tumors and matching adjacent mucosa (n=38) from patients treated with pre-operative chemoradiation. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for MIB, Cyclin E, p21, p27, p53, survivin, Bcl-2, and BAX. Immunoreactivity along with clinical variables was subjected to univariate and forward stepwise logistic regression analyses., RESULTS: Pathological complete response (pCR) was 23.9%. The number of positive lymph nodes obtained in the resected specimen was associated with pCR. Immunoreactivity for MIB (Sn 15%, Sp 65%, OR 0.33), p53 (Sn 3%, Sp 84%, OR 0.16), Bcl-2 (Sn 11%, Sp 74%, OR 0.35), and BAX (Sn 92%, Sp 80%, OR 46) was associated with pathological response (all p's<0.001). Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that MIB was an independent predictor of a response to chemoradiation (p=0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: A combined panel of mediators of apoptosis alone or combined with clinical factors is a feasible approach that can be applied to rectal tumor biopsies to predict a response to chemoradiation. The most sensitive factor was BAX; while MIB independently predicted a response to chemoradiation. Copyright Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded,0.9074353

Background In gastric MALT lymphomas persisting after Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication, a treatment by moderate-dose radiotherapy (RT) has been proposed but its efficacy has not been confirmed in large prospective series with long term endoscopic follow-up. Method Patients with localised gastric MALT lymphoma persisting after H. pylori eradication were offered moderate-dose RT (30 Gy, 2 Gy/fraction) and followed with annual endoscopies. All biopsies before and after RT were reviewed by a committee of pathologists. Results From 1995 to 2011, out of the 232 patients followed prospectively, 53 received RT for persistence of lymphoma after H. pylori eradication: either macroscopic ulcer (n = 31), or microscopic lymphomatous infiltrate (n = 22), after a mean follow-up of 12 and 31 months, respectively. All lymphomas were localised (45 stage IE and 8 stage IIE) and 38 (72%) were H. pylori-positive. The mean clinical and endoscopic follow-up from diagnosis was 7.6 years (2.2-19.1). No acute or late toxicity occurred. A complete remission was achieved in all patients but one (98%) with no relapse after a median follow-up of 4.9 years (1.3-16.6) after completion of RT. Overall survival and 5-year disease specific survival were 94% and 100%, respectively. One patient died of gastric adenocarcinoma.

2969,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for essential tremor: Retrospective analysis of a 19-year experience. Background: Essential Tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder that can be disabling. Initial treatment is in the form of medical therapies. Patients with medically refractory ET seek surgical intervention which include radiofrequency thalamotomy, deep brain stimulation, and radiosurgical thalamotomy. Radiosurgical thalamotomy is a minimally invasive surgical option which is especially valuable for elderly and high surgical risk patients. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze the outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for patients suffering from medically refractory essential tremor. Method(s): During a 19-year period (1996-2015), 73 patients underwent gamma knife thalamotomy for intractable essential tremor. A median central dose of 140 Gy (range, 130-150) was delivered to the nucleus ventralis intermedius through a single 4-mm isocenter. We used the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale to score tremor, handwriting, drawing, and ability to drink fluids. The median time to last follow-up was 28 months (range, 6-152). Result(s): After gamma knife thalamotomy, 93.2% improved in tremor. Forty-four patients (60.3%) experienced tremor arrest or barely perceptible tremor. Eighteen patients (24.7%) noted tremor arrest and complete restoration of motor function. Tremor improvement was sustained at last follow-up in 96% of patients who experience tremor relief. Mean tremor score improved from 3.19 before to 1.27 after gamma knife thalamotomy (P < 0.0001). Mean handwriting score improved from 2.97 to 1.25 (P < 0.0001). Mean drawing score improved from 3.16 to 1.26 (P < 0.0001). Mean drinking score improved from 3.14 to 1.56 (P < 0.0001). Imaging follow-up showed three types of lesions: enhancing lesion, streaking along internal capsule on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and significant reactive changes. Three patients (4%) experienced temporary adverse radiation effects.

2970,"Initial SRS for Patients With 5 to 15 Brain Metastases: Results of a Multi-Institutional Experience. Purpose: Several studies evaluating stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for patients with >4 brain metastases (BM) demonstrated similar outcomes after treatment of 1, 2 to 4, and 5 to 15 BM; others found clinically significant survival decrements in the latter group. In this review of 8 academic centers, we compared outcomes of patients undergoing initial SRS for 1, 2 to 4, and 5 to 15 BM. Methods and Materials: A total of 2089 patients treated with initial SRS for BM were included. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Patient and disease characteristics were evaluated for association with OS and cumulative incidence of distant brain failure (DBF) using stepwise multivariable Cox proportional hazards and competing risk regression modeling. Result(s): In this series, 989 (47%) patients had 1 metastasis, 882 (42%) had 2 to 4 metastases, and 212 (10%) had 5 to 15 metastases treated. Median OS for the 1, 2 to 4, and 5 to 15 BM groups was 14.6, 9.5, and 7.5 months, respectively (log-rank P < .01). Univariate and multivariable analyses revealed no difference in survival between 2 to 4 and 5 to 15 BM. DBF at 1 year was 30%, 41%, and 50%, respectively (Gray's P < .01). Two-year cumulative incidence of salvage SRS decreased with increasing number of BM (1: 21% vs 2-4: 19% vs 5-15: 13%; P < .01), but no difference in salvage whole brain radiation therapy was observed (1: 12% vs 2-4: 15% vs 5-15: 16%, P = .10). At the time of DBF, median brain metastasis velocity was 3.9, 6.1, and 11.7 new metastases per year in the 1, 2 to 4, and 5 to 15 BM groups, respectively (P < .01). Conclusion(s): Patients treated with initial SRS for 5 to 15 BM experienced survival similar to that in patients with 2 to 4 BM. Lower rates of salvage SRS were observed in the 5 to 15 BM group, with no difference in rates of salvage whole brain radiation therapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.038544554

Polygon displays compress information that would otherwise be conveyed by separate indicators into a single display in which each reading is represented by the distance of a polygon vertex from its center. The effect on detection of fault states of varying the number of polygon vertices from 4 to 20 in a display presented peripherally around a dynamic, simulated flight display was studied. Presence of the dynamic task reduced both speed and accuracy of response to the polygon display but did not significantly affect the pattern of response to differing numbers of vertices. All measures of performance were better with larger numbers of vertices. If the vertices are processed serially, more vertices require more processing time. Therefore, the result argues for holistic processing and implies that such information integration is beneficial to human performance in fault detection.",Excluded,0.03920596
2972,"Three-dimensional conformal reirradiation for locoregionally recurrent lung cancer previously treated with radiation therapy. Background: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of reirradiation using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in symptomatic patients with locoregionally recurrent lung cancer. Method(s): Between 2005 and 2012, 15 patients with locoregionally recurrent lung cancer were retreated with 3D-CRT after previously receiving thoracic radiotherapy. The median interval between the initial irradiation and reirradiation was 12 months (range, five to 41 months). The median initial radiotherapy dose was 63Gy (range, 45-70 Gy), and reirradiation doses ranged from 25.2 to 45.2Gy (median, 36Gy), with daily fractions of 1.8-4Gy (median, 2Gy). Result(s): After reirradiation, 80% of the patients experienced resolved or diminished symptoms for one or more of their symptoms, with an 83% improvement in a total of 24 symptoms. The overall tumor response rate to reirradiation was 46.7%, with progressive disease occurring in only one patient. The median overall survival (OS) time was 11 months (range, one to 27 months), and the one-year OS rate was 47%. The progression-free survival time ranged from one to 10 months (median, five months). In univariate analysis, the use of combined chemotherapy and a higher reirradiation dose showed a trend toward improved survival after reirradiation.

Conclusion(s): Reirradiation using 3D-CRT with moderate doses for locoregionally recurrent lung cancer can provide palliative benefits without severe complications to the majority of selected patients with symptoms as a result of a regrowing tumor. © 2014 Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Excluded,0.038367834
2973,"[COMBINED USE OF INTERFERON-GAMMA RELEASE ASSAY AND LOW-DOSE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY FOR TUBERCULOSIS SCREENING PROGRAM OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS]. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of the interferon-gamma release assays and low-dose computed tomography for the pulmonary tuberculosis screenings program of health care workers., DESIGN: For the pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) screenings program, T-SPOT.TB (one of interferon-gamma release assays: IGRA) were performed on 332 health care workers (HCWs) with normal chest roentgenogram and without the history of TB treatment. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) was also performed on IGRA positive HCWs., RESULTS: Ten of 332 subjects were positive IGRA. LDCT was performed on IGRA positive 10 subjects. Abnormal findings were noted in 2 of 10 subjects by LDCT. One had CT findings compatible with active TB and finally diagnosed as active TB. Another had scarring shadow at right S5 and lingular segment. Nine of 10 IGRA positive subjects were judged as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Three hundred twenty-one subjects with negative and borderline IGRA of 332 HCWs were judged as not infected with TB., CONCLUSION: Combined use of IGRA and LDCT for tuberculosis screening program of HCWs was found to be effective for early diagnosis of TB, accurate diagnosis of LTBI and judgment of non-infective subjects.",Excluded,0.038487785
2974,"A Two-step intensity-modulated radiation therapy method for nasopharyngeal cancer: The Kinki University experience. Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical results of our adaptive radiation therapy scheme of a two-step intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) method for nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) at Kinki University Hospital. Method(s): Between 2000 and 2007, 35 patients with Stage I-IVB NPC treated by IMRT were included. For all patients, treatment-planning computed tomography was done twice before and during IMRT to a total dose of 60-70 Gy/28-35 fractions (median 68 Gy). Chemotherapy (cisplatin 80 mg/m2/3 weeks x 1-3 courses) was given concurrently with IMRT for 31 patients. Result(s): The 3- and 5-year overall survival rates for the 31 patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy were 88% and 83%, respectively. The 3- and 5-year loco-regional control rates for the 31 patients were 93% and 87%, respectively. Planning target volume delineation for the primary site or involved nodes was insufficient for three early cases, resulting in marginal recurrence in the three patients (9%). Except for one patient with early death, xerostomia scores at 1-2 years were: Grade 0, 11; Grade 1, 17; Grade 2, 5; Grade 3, 1. Conclusion(s): Excellent overall survival and loco-regional control rates were obtained by a two-step IMRT method with concurrent chemotherapy for NPC, although marginal recurrence was noted in some early cases. © The Author (2009).

2975,"Characterization of haustral activity in the human colon. Contraction patterns of the human colon are rarely discussed from the perspective of its haustra. Colonic motility was analyzed in 21 healthy subjects using 84-sensor manometry catheters with 1-cm sensor spacing. Capsule endoscopy and manometry showed evidence of narrow rhythmic circular muscle contractions. X-ray images of haustra and sensor locations allowed us to identify manometry motor activity as intrahaustral activity. Two common motor patterns were observed that we infer to be associated with individual haustra: rhythmic pressure activity confined to a single sensor, and activity confined to a section of the colon of 3-6 cm length. Intrahaustral activity was observed by 3-4 sensors. Approximately 50% of the haustra were intermittently active for -30% of the time; 2,402 periods of haustral activity were analyzed. Intrahaustral activity showed rhythmic pressure waves, propagating in mixed direction, 5-30 mmHg in amplitude at a frequency of -3 cpm (range 2-6) or -12 cpm (range 7-15), or exhibiting a checkerboard segmentation pattern. Boundaries of the haustra showed rhythmic pressure activity with or without elevated baseline pressure. Active haustra often showed no boundary activity probably allowing transit to neighboring haustra. Haustral boundaries were seen at the same sensor for the 6- to 8-h study duration, indicating that they did not propagate, thereby likely contributing to continence. The present study elucidates the motility characteristics of haustral boundaries and the nature of intrahaustral motor patterns and paves the way for investigating their possible role in pathophysiology of defecation disorders.Copyright © 2021 the American Physiological Society",Excluded,0.03867339

2977,"Skull-base invasion of nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Magnetic resonance imaging findings and therapeutic implications. Purpose: To evaluate the value of skull-base abnormality on MRI for predicting local recurrence in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Material(s) and Method(s): Between November 1988 and February 1997, 48 patients with NPC were examined with both MRI (1.5 T) and CT prior to radiation therapy. T classification (1987 UICC) based on physical examination and CT findings were T1 in 3 cases, T2 in 22, T3 in 9, and T4 in 14. On MRI, low-intensity tissue with Gd enhancement in the marrow of the skull was considered to be a suspicious finding of skull-base invasion. CT simulation was performed in all patients. The total dose to the primary tumor was 60-75 Gy (mean, 67 Gy). The mean follow-up period was 42 months. Result(s): All 14 T4 patients had abnormal tissue in the marrow of the skull base on MRI. Thirty-eight percent (13 of 34) of T1-3 patients were suspected to have skull-base invasion based on MRI (0% for T1, 27% [6 of 22] for T2, and 78% [7 of 9] for T3). The 5-year local control rate was significantly different between T1-3 and T4 tumors (97% vs. 69%, p < 0.025) but was not different by the presence of the MRI abnormality in the skull base. Conclusion(s): Skull-base invasion suspected solely by MRI does not relate to local recurrence provided that careful treatment planning is performed with the aid of MRI and CT simulator.

2978,"Radiosensitivity: Gender and Order of Administration of G-CSF, An Experimental Study in Mice. To elucidate the potential influence of stimulating bone marrow before cell-cycle-dependent irradiation, we sought to determine overall survival in mice receiving total-body irradiation (TBI) when administered granulocyte stimulating factor (G-CSF) at different time points. Gender differences were also studied. C57/BL/6J mice, aged 9-14 weeks, received 8 Gy TBI in a perspex cage using a linear accelerator. In each of five different experiments, three groups were studied: 1. one control group receiving TBI only; 2. one group treated with filgrastim [500 lg/kg subcutaneously/intraperitoneally (s.c./i.p.)] the day before TBI, followed by daily filgrastim injections postirradiation (1-5 days); and 3. one group treated with daily filgrastim injections only post-TBI (1-5 days). Each experimental group included male and female mice. Survival of the mice was monitored daily, and mice were euthanized when their condition deteriorated. A total of 293 mice were monitored for at least 37 days post-TBI. Control mice that received 8 Gy TBI showed a significant gender difference, with a median survival of 22 days in females and 17 days in males. Addition of G-CSF, irrespective of pre- or postirradiation, significantly improved survival, but in males the improvement was significantly better when G-CSF was not given before TBI. Improved survival in females was independent of the order of administration of GCSF. Multiple filgrastim injections were more effective than a single injection, and s.c. administration was not better than i.p. In conclusion, these findings indicate that male mice are more sensitive to TBI than females. Filgrastim improved survival in both genders irrespective of whether given pre- or postirradiation, but in males the improvement was significantly less if an injection was given before irradiation. These results suggest that, to prevent toxicity most effectively, GCSF should not be given before cytotoxic therapy. While a completely different experimental model was used here, these results may also be extrapolated to indicate that endocrine cell-cycle suppression therapy should not be given before or during cytotoxic therapy of hormone-dependent tumors (e.g., breast and prostate cancer), thus a reduction in the efficacy of cell-cycle-dependent therapy can be prevented.Copyright © 2019 by Radiation Research Society.

2980,"Increased protoporphyrin IX accumulation does not improve the effect of photodynamic therapy for actinic keratosis: a randomized controlled trial. Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with methyl aminolaevulinate (MAL) is highly effective for treating actinic keratosis (AK) on the face/scalp, but less effective on the extremities. Insufficient accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) may cause these inferior efficacy rates. However, it is possible to increase PpIX accumulation by extending the MAL application time and/or pretreating the skin with curettage. Objective(s): To investigate whether increased PpIX accumulation improves the effect of MAL-PDT for AKs in a randomized intra-individual study. Method(s): Twenty-two patients with 533 AKs on both hands were treated with MAL-PDT. To obtain different concentrations of PpIX, four symmetrical areas on each patient were randomly allocated to different regimens: (i) 3-h MAL application without prior curettage (3hC-); (ii) 3 h with curettage (3hC+); (iii) 21 h without curettage (21hC-); and (iv) 21 h with curettage (21hC+). Treatment efficacy was evaluated after 3 months, whereas PpIX fluorescence, pain and erythema were assessed during and after PDT. Result(s): Extended MAL application with and without curettage increased PpIX accumulation significantly compared with the standard 3hC+ regimen (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). However, the median total clearance rates did not improve accordingly: 3hC+ (55.0%), 21hC- (55.0%) and 21hC+ (53.6%). Conversely, insufficient PpIX accumulation in the 3hC- regimen led to a significantly lower clearance rate (33.3%) than the other regimens (P < 0.045). Furthermore, pain and erythema were correlated to PpIX accumulation. Conclusion(s): Increased PpIX accumulation does not improve the effect of MAL-PDT for AKs on the hands, but leads to worse adverse events. Different strategies are needed to improve PDT on the extremities.Copyright © 2016 British Association of Dermatologists",Excluded,0.03829868

The purpose of this study was to measure the dose of radiation delivered to the cochlea during a Gamma knife surgery (GKS) procedure for treatment of patients with vestibular schwannomas (VSs), and to analyze the relationship between cochlear irradiation and the hearing outcome of these patients. Methods. Eighty-two patients with VSs were treated with GKS using a marginal dose of 12 Gy. No patient had neurofibromatosis Type 2 disease, and all had a Gardner-Robertson hearing class of I to IV before treatment, and a radiological and audiological follow-up of at least 1-year after GKS. The dosimetric data of the volume of the cochlea were retrospectively analyzed and were correlated with the auditory outcome of patients. Results. The mean radiation dose delivered to the cochlear volume ranged from 1.30 to 10.00 Gy (median 4.15 Gy). The cochlea received significantly higher radiation doses in patients with worsening of hearing after GKS. A highly significant association between the cochlear and the intracanalicular dose of radiation delivered during GKS was found. Conclusions. During GKS for VSs, relatively high doses of radiation can be delivered to the cochlea. Worsening of hearing after GKS can be the consequence of either radiation injury to the cochlea or the irradiation dose delivered into the auditory canal, or both.",Excluded,0.06534697
2982,"Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway, X-ray exposure, and lung cancer risk: a multicenter case-control study in Central Europe. Exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) results in various types of DNA damage and is a suspected cause of lung cancer. An essential cellular machinery against DNA damage is cell cycle control, which is regulated by several genes, including TP53, CCND1, and CDKN2A. Therefore, we hypothesized that the genetic variants in these three genes influence the predisposition of lung cancer (i.e., CCND1 G870A, CDKN2A Ala(148)Thr, TP53 Arg(72)Pro, and 16-bp repeat in intron 3) and that the effect of X-ray on lung cancer risk can be modified by the presence of these genetic variations. The study was conducted in 15 centers in 6 countries of Central Europe between 1998 and 2002. A total of 2,238 cases and 2,289 controls were recruited and provided DNA samples. Cases with positive family history were analyzed separately. The joint effect of X-ray and previous risk genotypes was assessed, and modification by sequence variants on X-ray dose-response relationship with lung cancer risk was evaluated. We found an overall effect of TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats [odds ratio (OR), 1.99; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.27-3.13], which was stronger among cases with family history of lung cancer (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.29-6.87). In addition, our results suggested an interaction that was greater than multiplicativity between TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats and multiple X-ray exposures (interaction OR, 5.69; 95% CI, 1.33-24.3). We did not observe a main effect of CCND1 G870A polymorphism; however, the dose-response relationship between lung cancer risk and X-ray exposures was modified by CCND1 genotype with no risk from X-ray exposures among subjects who carried G/G genotype, intermediate risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.27) among subjects with G/A genotype, and highest risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12-1.49) among subjects with A/A genotype. Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway may increase the risk of lung cancer and modify the risk conferred by multiple X-ray exposures. However, a definite conclusion can only be drawn on replication by different studies among individuals who are highly exposed to IR.",Included,0.97073

The objective of this study was to analyze the influence of the increment of gantry angle and the number of arcs on esophageal volumetric modulated arc therapy plan. All plans were done in Monaco planning system for Elekta Synergy linear accelerator with 80 multileaf collimator (MLC). Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were done with different increment of gantry angle like 15 o , 20 o , 30 o and 40 o. The remaining parameters were similar for all the plans. The results were compared. To compare the plan quality with number of arcs, VMAT plans were done with single and dual arc with increment of gantry angle of 20 o. The dose to gross tumor volume (GTV) for 60 Gy and planning target volume (PTV) for 48 Gy was compared. The dosimetric parameters D 98% , D 95% , D 50% and D max of GTV were analyzed. The homogeneity index (HI) and conformity index (CI) of GTV were studied and the dose to 98% and 95% of PTV was analyzed. Maximum dose to spinal cord and planning risk volume of cord (PRV cord) was compared. The Volume of lung receiving 10 Gy, 20 Gy and mean dose was analyzed. The volume of heart receiving 30 Gy and 45 Gy was compared. The volume of normal tissue receiving greater than 2 Gy and 5 Gy was compared. The number of monitor units (MU) required to deliver the plans were compared.

2984,"How far can the radiation dose be lowered in head CT with iterative reconstruction? Analysis of imaging quality and diagnostic accuracy. Objective: To evaluate the imaging quality of head CT at lowered radiation dose by combining filtered back projection (FBP) and iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms. Method(s): Experimental group A (n = 66) underwent CT with 43 % tube current reduction, and group B (n = 58) received an equivalent reduced dose by lowering the tube voltage. An age- and sex-matched control group (n = 72) receiving the conventional radiation dose was retrospectively collected. Imaging for the control group was reconstructed by FBP only, while images for groups A and B were reconstructed by FBP and IR. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs), sharpness, number of infarcts and severity of subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (SAE) were compared to assess imaging quality and diagnostic accuracy. Result(s): There were no significant differences in SNRs and CNRs between group A and the control group. There were significantly decreased SNRs and increased CNRs in group B. Image sharpness decreased in both groups. Correlations between detected infarcts and severity of SAE across FBP and IR were high (r = 0.73-0.93). Head diameter was the only significant factor inversely correlated with infratentorial imaging quality. Conclusion(s): Head CT with 43 % reduced tube current reconstructed by IR provides diagnostic imaging quality for outpatient management. Key Points: * Cranial CT using iterative reconstruction provides diagnostic images with 43 % mAs reduction. * Blurring of infratentorial images becomes evident using low-radiation head CT. * Head diameter was inversely correlated with imaging quality in the infratentorium. * Lowering tube kilovoltage requires a higher radiation dose to maintain image quality. © 2013 European Society of Radiology.",Excluded,0.038774796

Ultraviolet irradiation therapy, including psoralen and ultraviolet A therapy and narrow-band ultraviolet B (310-312 nm) therapy, is a widely used and highly efficient treatment modality for psoriasis. Therapy with 308-nm excimer light has been reported to be effective for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris. To evaluate the efficacy of 308-nm excimer light therapy for Japanese psoriasis patients, seven patients (six men and one woman) with plaque-type psoriasis were treated with 308-nm excimer light at 7-14-day intervals. The Psoriasis Severity Index (PSI) was calculated for individual plaques in order to assess the effectiveness of the therapy.

2987,"Growth factor treatment prior to low-dose total body irradiation increases donor cell engraftment after bone marrow transplantation in mice. Low-toxicity conditioning regimens prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are widely explored. We developed a new protocol using hematopoietic growth factors prior to low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) in recipients of autologous transplants to establish high levels of long-term donor cell engraftment. We hypothesized that treatment of recipient mice with growth factors would selectively deplete stem cells, resulting in successful long-term donor cell engraftment after transplantation. Recipient mice were treated for 1 or 7 days with growth factors (stem cell factor [SCF] plus interleukin 11 [IL-11], SCF plus Flt-3 ligand [FL], or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) prior to low-dose TBI (4 Gy). Donor cell chimerism was measured after transplantation of congenic bone marrow cells. High levels of donor cell engraftment were observed in recipients pretreated for 7 days with SCF plus IL-11 or SCF plus FL. Although 1-day pretreatments with these cytokines initially resulted in reduced donor cell engraftment, a continuous increase in time was observed, finally resulting in highly significantly increased levels of donor cell contribution. In contrast, G-CSF treatment showed no beneficial effects on long-term engraftment. In vitro stem cell assays demonstrated the effect of cytokine treatment on stem cell numbers. Donor cell engraftment and number of remaining recipient stem cells after TBI were strongly inversely correlated, except for groups treated for 1 day with SCF plus IL-11 or SCF plus FL. We conclude that long-term donor cell engraftment can be strongly augmented by treatment of recipient mice prior to low-dose TBI with hematopoietic growth factors that act on primitive cells.",Excluded,0.039742164

Aim: To compare the efficacy and toxicity of a three-step combination therapy with post-operative radiation alone for locally advanced esophageal cancer. Method(s): Patients with T3-4 and N0-1 esophageal carcinoma from a number of institutions were non-randomly, prospectively enrolled in the study. All patients underwent single-stage curative en bloc esophagectomy. The patients were then assigned into one of two treatment groups based on treatment consisting of either post-operative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m2 followed by systemic adjuvant chemotherapy (four monthly cycles of cisplatin 20 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil 1 000 mg/m2 for five consecutive days), or, post-operative radiation alone. The radiotherapy dose was 55-60 Gy for all patients. Primary end-point of this study was to assess the per-protocol patients' improvement of overall survival benefit. Secondary end-point was designed to evaluate both the per-protocol and intent-to-treat patients' outcome of survival. Result(s): A total of 60 patients (n = 30 per group) were enrolled in this study. The two groups were generally comparable for demographic characteristics and hematological and non-hematological toxicities. The CCRT with weekly cisplatin was well tolerated, with significantly better overall survival (30.9 mo vs 20.7 mo; 95% CI, 27.5-36.4 vs 15.2-26.1) and 3-year survival (70.0% vs 33.7%; P = 0.003). Low histological grade of tumor (P<0.001) was associated with favorable survival in these locally advanced patients.

PURPOSE: To define the diagnostic precision of non-specialized readers in the detection of type 2 endoleaks (T2EL) in arterial versus venous phase acquisitions, and to evaluate an approach for radiation dose reduction., METHODS: The pre-discharge and final follow-up multi-slice CT angiographies of 167 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Image data were separated into an arterial and a venous phase reading set. Two radiology residents assessed the reading sets for the presence of a T2EL, feeding vessels, and aneurysm sac size. Findings were compared with a standard of reference established by two experts in interventional radiology. The effective dose was calculated., RESULTS: Overall, experts detected 131 T2ELs, and 331 feeding vessels in 334 examinations. Persistent T2ELs causing aneurysm sac growth > 5 mm were detected in 20 patients. Radiation in arterial and venous phases contributed to a mean of 58.6% and 39.0% of the total effective dose. Findings of reader 1 and 2 showed comparable sensitivities in arterial sets of 80.9 versus 85.5 (p = 0.09), and in venous sets of 73.3 versus 79.4 (p = 0.15), respectively.

Objectives Published radiation dose estimates for Rubidium-82 vary widely, and no comprehensive study in man has yet been conducted. With the increasing use of Rb-82 PET for myocardial perfusion imaging, improved dosimetry information is needed for accurate risk assessment. The purpose of this study was to measure Rb-82 internal organ and effective doses with PET/CT in humans. Methods We recruited 26 cardiac patients and 4 normal subjects with no cardiac history. Dynamic 3D PET scans were acquired (GE Discovery RX/VCT) over 10 minutes following IV injection of 10 MBq/kg Rb-82. Images were reconstructed using FORE-OSEM and 8 mm Hann filter. Cardiac scans of the chest were acquired at rest for all 30 subjects, plus one additional scan of the Head, Neck, Abdomen, Pelvis, or Thighs. Mean Rb-82 residence times were determined in 22 source organs using volumes-of-interest (VOI) drawn on the fused PET/CT images. For large organs a small VOI was used to avoid partial volume losses. For small organs the average activity above 80% threshold was multiplied by the volume at 40% of the peak value within the organ VOI. Target organ doses and the effective dose estimate were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 according to ICRP 60, and recalculated according to ICRP 103. Results A total of 283 organs were measured across the 60 scans, with at least 4 samples obtained in each source organ. The average 'adult' effective dose for Rubidium-82 was found to be 0.00074 mSv/MBq using ICRP 60. Using ICRP 103, the male and female effective doses were 0.00074 and 0.00092 mSv/MBq respectively. The highest absorbed organ dose was to the kidneys. Conclusions These dose estimates for Rubidium-82 are the first to be measured directly with PET/CT in humans, and are 4 to 4.5 times lower than previous ICRP 60 values based on a theoretical blood flow model. The new values derived from human studies suggest a typical effective dose of 0.6 mSv per scan with 3D PET.",Excluded,0.041221857

The following BMI-adapted contrast material protocol was used for imaging of 70 consecutively registered patients: BMI < 17.5, 50 mL contrast material at 4.0 mL/s; 17.5-22.4, 55 mL at 4.0 mL/s; 22.5-24.9, 65 mL at 4.0 mL/s; 25.0-27.4, 80 mL at 4.5 mL/s; 27.5-29.9, 80 mL at 5.0 mL/s; 30.0-34.9, 85 mL at 5.0 mL/s; 35.0-40.0, 95 mL at 5.0 mL/s; > 40, 105 mL at 5.0 mL/s. Seventy patients matched for BMI who had previously undergone routine coronary CT angiography with a fixed contrast material dosage of 80 mL at 5 mL/s served as the reference group. Vessel attenuation in the left main and proximal right coronary arteries was measured and correlated with BMI, and the results in the two protocol groups were compared., RESULTS: The groups were well matched for BMI. The mean BMI in the nonadapted protocol group was 26.5 +/- 4.0 (standard deviation) (range, 18.9-36.5), and that in the BMI-adapted protocol group was 26.7 +/- 4.2 (range, 18.2-37.2) (p not significant). The mean amount of contrast material used was smaller in the BMI-adapted group (73.9 +/- 11.2 vs 80.0 +/- 0 mL; p < 0.01). Mean coronary artery attenuation did not differ significantly between the two groups (386 +/- 102 HU vs 385 +/- 64 HU; p not significant). Without BMI adaptation, coronary attenuation correlated strongly with BMI (r = -0.63; p < 0.001). With the BMI-adapted protocol, however, there was no correlation between BMI and coronary attenuation (r = -0.24; p not significant)., CONCLUSION: We validated a BMI-adapted contrast material protocol that results in adequate coronary vessel attenuation independent of individual BMI despite a significant reduction in overall amount of contrast material used.",Excluded,0.03852922

Aim: Prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with macrovascular invasion (MVI) is extremely poor. However, proper therapeutic strategies have not been established yet. The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for MVI of HCC. Method(s): We have analyzed and evaluated 80 consecutive patients with HCC with MVI who underwent EBRT, and factors associated with enhanced survival in EBRT were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): The local response rate of radiotherapy for the irradiated MVI was 66.2%. The time to progression of the irradiated MVI was 5.8 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the higher irradiation dose (over 45 Gy) and the irradiation location (hepatic vein tumor thrombus - HVTT) were significant factors associated with survival benefits of EBRT. The response of EBRT for HVTT was significantly superior to that for portal vein or bile duct tumor thrombus. Conclusion(s): We conclude that a multidisciplinary therapeutic strategy based on EBRT should be proactively selected in the treatment of advanced HCC with MVI.Copyright © 2019 S.

Material(s) and Method(s): Under HIPPAA compliance, consecutive series of 27 subjects with 3D ankle MRI isotropic data sets (0.65 mm voxel, fast spin echo, proton density weighted sequence) performed on 3 T scanners were used. Three subjects with incomplete x-ray series were excluded. Thus, a total of 24 subjects, 11 left and 13 right ankles, were included in the study, of which 8 were male and 16 females. Age ranged from 17 to 73 with mean of 46 years. Segmented joint models (bone surface reconstructed x-rays) were created on all isotropic MR data sets by one observer. Three readers independently performed various blinded angular and joint space measurements on the models, corresponding 2D MRI, and radiographs (XR) at study inception and 8 weeks later. Means and standard deviations were calculated. Paired t-tests were performed for each pair (XR vs. 2D, XR vs. 3D and 2D vs. 3D) within each parameter. P values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant and box plots were generated. Spearman correlation coefficient between measurements was performed to assess Inter-reader agreement. Interclass correlation and time difference analysis was performed. Result(s): 3D segmentation models resembling x-ray were successfully created in all cases within 20 (+/-5) minutes. Good agreement (ICC > 0.65) between all reader measurements was noted across all modalities with the exception of measuring the Talocural angle (3D, 2D, XR), talar pitch (3D), and tibibofibular clear space (2D), which showed weak to poor correlation. Time consumption was significantly greater (p < 0.05) on 2D vs 3D for all measurements except lateral clear space and medial tibiotalar concavity assessments. Time consumption was noted to be significantly greater (p < 0.05) on XR as compared to 3D for nearly half the measurements (5 of 11) for each reader. Conclusion(s): 3D bone and joint segmentation models resembling x-ray are feasible from isotropic ankle MRI data sets, which might lead to possibility of automated measurements by computer in future. While good correlation was noted between all readers, absolute measurement values were significantly different between modalities. The differences in absolute values is likely related to positioning variances (rotated x-ray mortise causing varied joint width, non-angle corrected 2D images, weight bearing vs non weight bearing, and the optimal positioning of reconstructed 3D image). Tighter collimation, a protocol variation, also limited evaluation in some cases by non-inclusion of reference points normally used with XR imaging and contributed to variance. Very good (ICC > 0.7) intrareader agreement was noted for most measurements with a few measurements showing moderate to good correlation (ICC > 0.5 to 0.65), Measurements on the 3D model of joint spaces was significantly faster when compared to 2D and generally faster than XR.",Excluded,0.03844962
2995,"Ocular surface squamous neoplasia: Clinicopathological analysis and treatment outcome of 65 cases. Objectives: To find out the demography, clinical behaviour and outcome of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) in North-west Pakistan. Study Design: Case series. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Ophthalmology, Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan, from March 2011 to December 2017. Methodology: All patients with OSSN consulting this department were registered. A special proforma was designed to document demography, clinical features, management, and follow-up of all cases. At the end of study, the data was analysed using SPSS version 25 and the result compiled. Result(s): Sixty-five eyes with OSSN were included in the study, in which 40 (61.5%) were males and 25 (38.5%) were females. Mean age of the patients was 61.68 +/-12.76 years. Twenty-six (40%) patients were farmers and exposed to ultraviolet light for prolong period. Fifty-nine (90.8%) presented with a painless, reddish mass on ocular surface. Average size of neoplasm at presentation was 18.60 +/- 11.30 mm in large dimension. Histopathologically, 23 (35.4%) were carcinoma in situ and 41(63%) invasive squamous cell carcinoma. During the period of follow-up 41 (63.1%) cured, 21 (32.2%) developed recurrence, and 3 (4.6%) patients passed away. Conclusion(s): OSSN is common in North-west Pakistan. The presentation is late due to certain socio-economic factors; but overall behaviour of the neoplasm is almost the same as mentioned in other studies from different parts of the world.Copyright © 2020 College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan.

2996,"Long-term functional and survival outcomes after induction chemotherapy and risk-based definitive therapy for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Background The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term outcomes after induction chemotherapy followed by ""risk-based"" local therapy for locally-advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Methods Forty-seven patients (stage IV; >=N2b) were enrolled in a phase II trial. Baseline and 24-month functional measures included modified barium swallow (MBS) studies, oropharyngeal swallow efficiency (OPSE), and the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI). Functional status was assessed at 5 years. Results Five-year overall survival (OS) was 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81% to 99%). A nonsignificant 13% average reduction in swallowing efficiency (OPSE) was observed at 24 months relative to baseline (p =.191). MDADI scores approximated baseline at 24 months. Among 42 long-term survivors (median, 5.9 years), 3 patients (7.1%) had chronic dysphagia. The rate of final gastrostomy dependence was 4.8% (2 of 42). Conclusion Sequential chemoradiotherapy achieved favorable outcomes among patients with locally advanced SCCHN, mainly of oropharyngeal origin. MBS and MDADI scores found modest swallowing deterioration at 2 years, and chronic aspiration was uncommon in long-term survivors. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded,0.038485758

We used low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to study the cognitive and neural systems involved in the control of smooth pursuit eye movements. Eighteen participants were tested on two separate occasions. On each occasion we measured smooth pursuit eye tracking before and after 6 min of 1 Hz rTMS delivered at 90% of motor threshold. Low frequency rTMS over the posterior parietal cortex led to a significant reduction in smooth pursuit velocity gain, whereas rTMS over the motor cortex had no effect on gain. We conclude that low frequency offline rTMS is a potentially useful tool with which to explore the cortical systems involved in oculomotor control.",Excluded,0.040333163
3000,"Hearing Assessment after Treatment of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma with CRT and IMRT Techniques. OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the long-term hearing loss after treatment of primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma to elucidate its causal factors., METHODS: Ninety-two nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients were treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Pure tone audiometry was performed before the therapy and annually up to 9 years after completing treatment. The hearing thresholds were corrected for age-related deterioration and compared to the results without adjusting for age., RESULTS: The mean air and bone conduction threshold with and without correction for age-related deterioration differed significantly 2-9 years after completing radiotherapy (p < 0.05). The audiometry results with age correction showed a flattened configuration compared to the results without age correction. The total radiation dose and radiation modality showed a causal relationship with a greater incidence of hearing loss after therapy (p < 0.05). There was more deterioration in the air and bone hearing thresholds with conformal radiotherapy than intensity-modulated radiotherapy (p < 0.001). A radiation dose >72 cGy resulted in more severe hearing loss than <72 cGy (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Hearing loss after completing therapy should be corrected for age-related hearing deterioration to reveal the true extent to which the loss is a therapeutic complication. Both the radiation modality used and the dose were significantly associated with hearing loss.",Excluded,0.040050805
3001,"Investigations on radiosensitive and radioresistant populations of Drosophila melanogaster. XVI. Adaptation to the mutagenic effects of X-rays in several experimental populations with irradiation histories. Selection responses of the laboratory stock Berlin wild (+60, +K) of Drosophila melanogaster to the mutagenic effects of high, accumulated exposures of X-rays were studied in several sub-populations with long irradiation histories. Interest was focussed on adaptive adjustments of mutation rates. In samples from the populations, radiosensitivities of immature oocytes were tested, by using dominant lethals (A), X-chromosome losses (B) and sex-linked recessive lethals (C) as end-points of genetic radiation damage. Populations RO II and RO V are similar to the previously studied population RO I and were exposed to 2100 R/generation, delivered to oocyte stages 6-14, mature sperm, and spermatids. RO II (first tests after 160 generations) is radioresistant relative to +60 (control). The resistance was characterized by dose-reduction factors (DRFs) of 1.72 (with respect to end-points A, B) and 1.53 (C), and these were similar to those previously obtained for RO I. The resistance of RO II was inherited semidominantly as was that of RO I, and the radiosensitivity of the hybrids RO I/RO II was similar to that of RO I and RO II with respect to end-points A and B. RO V did not become resistant within 25 generations of irradiation history (A). Populations RO III (6000 R/generation) and RO IV (7000 R/generation) have histories of irradiations given to oogonia and spermatogonia. Radiosensitivities of immature oocytes of RO III did not differ from those of +K after 55 generations, but after 105 and 135 generations of irradiation history, DRFs of 1.2 (A) and 1.44 (B) were observed. RO IV was characterized in generations 55-135 by DRFs of 1.31 (A) and 1.72 (B). Selection for relative radioresistance of immature oocytes was found (1) to be reproducible (RO II-RO IV), (2) not to require genetic pre-adaptation (RO V), and (3) to be, in part, also achieved by 'indirect' selection (RO III, RO IV). It is concluded that mutation rates in populations are selectively adjusted to evolutionary requirements.",Excluded,0.97073406
3002,"Image quality of iterative reconstruction in cranial CT imaging: comparison of model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASiR). Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare cranial CT (CCT) image quality (IQ) of the MBIR algorithm with standard iterative reconstruction (ASiR)., Methods: In this institutional review board (IRB)-approved study, raw data sets of 100 unenhanced CCT examinations (120 kV, 50-260 mAs, 20 mm collimation, 0.984 pitch) were reconstructed with both ASiR and MBIR. Signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) were calculated from attenuation values measured in caudate nucleus, frontal white matter, anterior ventricle horn, fourth ventricle, and pons. Two radiologists, who were blinded to the reconstruction algorithms, evaluated anonymized multiplanar reformations of 2.5 mm with respect to depiction of different parenchymal structures and impact of artefacts on IQ with a five-point scale (0: unacceptable, 1: less than average, 2: average, 3: above average, 4: excellent)., Results: MBIR decreased artefacts more effectively than ASiR (p < 0.01). The median depiction score for MBIR was 3, whereas the median value for ASiR was 2 (p < 0.01). SNR and CNR were significantly higher in MBIR than ASiR (p < 0.01)., Conclusions: MBIR showed significant improvement of IQ parameters compared to ASiR. As CCT is an examination that is frequently required, the use of MBIR may allow for substantial reduction of radiation exposure caused by medical diagnostics.Copyright © 2014, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded,0.038418226
3003,"Dosimetry-based treatment for Graves' disease. Objective The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the long-Term outcome of a personalized dosimetry approach in Graves' disease aiming to render patients euthyroid from a planned thyroid absorbed dose of 60 Gy. Patients and methods A total of 284 patients with Graves' disease were followed prospectively following administration of radioiodine calculated to deliver an absorbed dose of 60 Gy. Patients with cardiac disease were excluded. Outcomes were analysed at yearly intervals for up to 10 years with a median follow-up of 37.5 months. Results A single radioiodine administration was sufficient to render a patient either euthyroid or hypothyroid in 175 (62%) patients, the remainder requiring further radioiodine. The median radioactivity required to deliver 60 Gy was 77 MBq. Less than 2% patients required 400-600 MBq, the standard activity administered in many centres. In the cohort receiving a single administration, 38, 32 and 26% were euthyroid on no specific thyroid medication at 3, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Larger thyroid volumes were associated with the need for further therapy. The presence of nodules on ultrasonography did not adversely affect treatment outcome. Conclusion A personalized dosimetric approach delayed the long-Term onset of hypothyroidism in 26% of patients. This was achieved using much lower administered activities than currently recommended. Future studies will aim to identify those patients who would benefit most from this approach.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded,0.038811658
3004,"Expression of CREB in primary pterygium and correlation with cyclin D1, ki-67, MMP7, p53, p63, Survivin and Vimentin. AIM: Ultraviolet (UV) B irradiation induces gene expression that leads to skin cancer. Among the transcription factors induced by UVB radiation exposure, the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is significant. Since several factors downstream of CREB signaling are known to be involved in pterygium pathogenesis, we investigated CREB expression in pterygial and human conjunctival tissues to evaluate if a similar expression pattern is present. Moreover, we analyzed the correlation with CREB expression and other known pterygium markers., METHODS: Primary pterygium samples and normal bulbar conjunctivas surgically removed were analyzed. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were stained by immunohistochemistry with anti-CREB, anti-vimentin, anti-ki-67, anti-survivin, anti-MMP7, anti-p63, anti-cyclin D1, or anti-p53 antibodies., RESULTS: 94.4% of pterygium samples were positive for CREB with a significant difference compared to the control group (p = 0.002). The staining was localized in the epithelium and absent in the stroma. An increased expression was found for cyclin D1 (p = 0.019), ki-67 (p = 0.005), vimentin (p = 0.003), survivin (p < 0.001), p63 (p = 0.003), and MMP7 (p = 0.002). CREB expression showed a significant correlation with cyclin D1 (rho = 0.49; p = 0.035), ki-67 (rho = 0.61; p = 0.007), and p53 (rho = 0.57; p = 0.013) in pterygium., CONCLUSIONS: These results permit to hypothesize that CREB is involved in pterygium pathogenesis. Since various molecules have been discovered to inhibit CREB, these data could be of interest for pterygium treatment. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded,0.06733255
3005,"The use of Gamma-irradiated proximal femoral allografts for bone stock reconstruction in complex revision hip arthroplasty. We have followed a consecutive series of 49 revision hip arthroplasties, performed for severe femoral bone loss using Gamma-irradiated anatomic-specific proximal femoral allografts longer than five centimetres. The patients were followed for a median 10.2 years, with a five year minimum follow-up. The median preoperative Harris Hip Score (HHS) improved from 42 points to 77 points postoperatively. In four hips the femoral component was further revised for non-union of the allograft and aseptic failure. In one hip the allograft and the femoral component were removed because of infection. In one hip the allograft and the femoral component were re-revised for host step-cut fracture. Junctional-union was observed in 44/49 hips. By defining success as an increase of HHS by 20 points or more, a stable implant and no need for any subsequent re-operations related to the allograft and /or the implant, a success rate of 76% was observed. Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis predicted 79% rate of survival at 10 years and 75% rate of survival at 17 years, with the need for further revision of the allograft and/or implant as the end point. Three hips underwent re-attachment of the greater trochanter for trochanteric escape. Asymptomatic non-union of the greater trochanter was noticed in another three hips. Moderate allograft resorption was observed in four hips. Two fractures of the host step-cut occurred. There were four dislocations. Good long-term results with the use of large anatomic-specific femoral allografts justify their continued use in cases of revision hip arthroplasty complicated with severe femoral bone loss.",Excluded,0.04302604

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a virtual CT-guided navigation system (Sirio-MASMEC Biomed) in performing lung biopsies, with greater attention to lesions smaller than 1 cm, compared to the traditional procedure., METHODS: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our Institute. Two hundred patients were prospectively selected. Of these, 100 were subjected to percutaneous procedure with the use of Sirio and 100 to traditional CT-guided percutaneous procedure. The two methods were compared in terms of absorbed dose, procedure time, complications, and number of non-diagnostic specimens (diagnostic success)., RESULTS: Sirio has shown a significant reduction in the absorbed dose and procedure times (p < 0.05), with a lower incidence of complications compared to the traditional procedure. Sirio has also allowed to carry out biopsies of lesions' diameter <=10 mm, obtaining fewer non diagnostic specimens thus resulting more effective in terms of diagnostic success., CONCLUSIONS: The use of Sirio in sampling biopsy showed a statistically significant reduction in terms of performed scans and procedural time with lower incidence of post-procedural complications compared to the traditional percutaneous procedure, especially for lesions <=10 mm. The best diagnostic result, the reduction of the dose absorbed and procedural complications makes the procedures more reliable, safety and less invasive.

3007,"Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test in river buffalo cells treated with Furocoumarins. Cytogenetic test can be very useful to detect chromosome (genome) fragility in both animal and human cells. Furocoumarin derivatives constitute a class of compounds widely investigated for the development of photo-chemotherapeutic drugs and effective in treating many diseases. The interest inside this research field originated from the effectiveness of PUVA therapy, realized by oral or topical administration of a linear furocoumarin (psoralen) followed by irradiation with UVA light, for the treatment of psoriasis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Furocoumarins are also present in Psoralea plants elected to be also used as alternative feed for animals considering that it's a perennial leguminous and, more important, it's green during the summer time. In the present study we report the preliminary results obtained using the SCE-test in river buffalo cells exposed in vitro to furocoumarin extracts from a Sardinian population of Posoralea morisana (L.) Stirton (Punta Giglio,). Peripheral blood samples from five young river buffaloes (2 males and 3 females) were incubated at 38 degreeC for 72 h in presence of different quantities of furocoumarin extracts: 0 (control), 50, 100, 200 and 400 mug/ml. Thirty cells for each cell culture (and furocoumarin dose) were analyzed. Although the cell growth appeared normal in both treated and untreated (control) cells, a significant (P<0.01) higher number of SCEs observed in treated cells, compared to those achieved in the control. On the basis of these results, cells from five river buffalo cows were treated with 0 (control), 100 and 200 mug/ml of furocoumarins for only 3 h after 24 h of incubation, in presence and absence of S9.

BACKGROUND: This prospective randomized study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of oral pilocarpine chloratum (Salagen) during and after radiotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1999 and December 2003, 66 patients received 60 Gy of irradiation to their head and neck cancer. Half of the patients received 5 mg oral pilocarpine 3 times a day from the beginning of radiotherapy over a period of 12 weeks. The control group received similar doses of pilocarpine only in the second 6 weeks following irradiation. Patient saliva secretion was recorded, and a visual analog scale measuring overall and daily xerostomia, difficulty in sleeping, speaking, eating and wearing dentures was employed., RESULTS: Pilocarpine, given concomitantly with radiotherapy, statistically improved the salivary flow and induced better patient comfort by the end of radiotherapy. Patient comfort and symptoms related to xerostomia greatly decreased compared to patients receiving pilocarpine after irradiation in the second 6-week period of therapy. The patients' quality of life, saliva production and symptoms related to xerostomia showed significant progress by the end of the 12 weeks., CONCLUSION: The results suggest that stimulated salivary glands suffer less decrease in saliva production during radiotherapy.

The treatment was chosen because of a high operative risk, previous thyroidectomy, or refusal to be operated on., MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Standard thyroid function variables and ultrasonically determined thyroid volume before treatment as well as 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment and then once a year., RESULTS: 56 patients were treated with a single dose of 131I, 12 with two doses, and one with four doses. In 45 patients treated with one dose and remaining euthyroid the median thyroid volume was reduced from 73 (interquartile range 50-106) ml to 29 (23-48) ml at 24 months in the 39 patients in whom this was measured during follow up. The median reduction was 40 (22-48) ml (60% reduction, p < 0.0001), half of which occurred within three months. Patients treated with two doses as well as those developing hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism had a significant reduction in thyroid volume. Eleven patients developed hypothyroidism (cumulative five year risk 22%, 95% confidence interval 4.8% to 38.4%). Side effects were few: three cases of hyperthyroidism and two cases of radiation thyroiditis. Only one patient was dissatisfied with the result; she was referred for operation six months after treatment., CONCLUSIONS: A substantial reduction in thyroid volume accompanied by a low incidence of hypothyroidism and few side effects makes the use of radioactive iodine an attractive alternative to surgery in selected cases of non-toxic multinodular goitre.",Excluded,0.07096686

Background Previous studies on ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure before and after a diagnosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) have been based primarily on questionnaires. Objective measures are needed. Objectives To assess changes in UVR exposure in patients with CMM using objective surrogate parameters in a descriptive study. Methods Ten patients recently diagnosed with CMM during the 5 months (autumn and winter) preceding study start in February 2009; 21 patients diagnosed from 12 months to 6 years before study start; and 15 controls, who matched the recently diagnosed patients on age, sex, residential area, constitutive skin type and occupation completed the investigations. UVR exposure before and after diagnosis of CMM was assessed using measures of serum 25-hydro vitamin D [25(OH)D], skin pigmentation and by interviews. Winter 25(OH)D was used as a surrogate parameter of UVR exposure the previous summer - the summer before CMM diagnosis in recently diagnosed patients. Results Winter 25(OH)D was significantly higher among recently diagnosed patients compared with controls (P = 0.02, R2 = 0.60) and patients diagnosed up to 6 years earlier (P = 0.01). The increase in 25(OH)D during the summer after diagnosis was significantly lower for recently diagnosed patients than for controls (P = 0.005, R2 = 0.51) and patients diagnosed up to 6 years earlier (P = 0.008). No difference was found in summer 25(OH)D between the groups. Conclusions Our findings suggest that patients with CMM had a higher UVR exposure the summer before diagnosis than did controls and patients diagnosed up to 6 years earlier, and that after diagnosis UVR exposure fell to the level of controls in patients with CMM. © 2011 The Authors.

PURPOSE: To investigate the possibility of reducing radiation dose exposure while maintaining image quality using multidetector computed tomography angiography (MDCTA) with high-concentration contrast media in patients undergoing follow-up after endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) to treat abdominal aortic aneurysm., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, single center, intra-individual study, patients underwent two consecutive MDCTA scans 6 months apart, one with a standard acquisition protocol (130 mAs/120 kV) and 120 mL of iomeprol 300, and one using a low dose protocol (100 mAs/80 kV) and 90 mL of iomeprol 400. Images acquired during the arterial phase of contrast enhancement were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively for image noise and intraluminal contrast enhancement., RESULTS: Thirty adult patients were prospectively enrolled. Statistically significantly higher attenuation values were measured in the low-dose acquisition protocol compared to the standard protocol, from the suprarenal abdominal aorta to the common femoral artery (p<0.0001; all vascular segments). Qualitatively, image quality was judged significantly (p=0.0002) better with the standard protocol than with the low-dose protocol. However, no significant differences were found between the two protocols in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) (13.63+/-6.97 vs. 11.48+/-8.13; p=0.1058). An overall dose reduction of up to 74% was observed for the low-dose protocol compared with the standard protocol., CONCLUSION: In repeat follow-up examinations of patients undergoing EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysm, a low-dose radiation exposure acquisition protocol provides substantially reduced radiation exposure while maintaining a constant CNR and good image quality.

PURPOSE: To assess the changes in intraocular scattering before and after instillation of rebamipide ophthalmic suspension in patients with dry eye after corneal refractive surgery., METHODS: This study enrolled 60 eyes of 30 dry eye patients undergoing corneal refractive surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to start topical administration of rebamipide ophthalmic suspension (rebamipide group) or artificial tears (control group) 4 times daily for 4 weeks. Tear secretion, tear break-up time (TBUT), and the fluorescein score were measured before and after treatment. Intraocular light scattering was also measured as the objective scattering index (OSI) at 0.5-second intervals over 10 seconds., RESULTS: In the rebamipide group, the Schirmer I test, TBUT, and fluorescein score improved significantly, from 11.4 +/- 9.0 mm, 2.2 +/- 0.7 seconds, and 4.3 +/- 1.3 to 14.9 +/- 7.4 mm, 4.5 +/- 1.7 seconds, and 1.9 +/- 1.0, respectively (P = 0.006, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test).

3017,"Improving adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer by combining protracted-infusion fluorouracil with radiation therapy after curative surgery. BACKGROUND: The combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy with fluorouracil plus semustine after surgery has been established as an effective approach to decreasing the risk of tumor relapse and improving survival in patients with rectal cancer who are at high risk for relapse or death. We sought to determine whether the efficacy of chemotherapy could be improved by administering fluorouracil by protracted infusion throughout the duration of radiation therapy and whether the omission of semustine would reduce the toxicity and delayed complications of chemotherapy without decreasing its antitumor efficacy., METHODS: Six hundred sixty patients with TNM stage II or III rectal cancer received intermittent bolus injections or protracted venous infusions of fluorouracil during postoperative radiation to the pelvis. They also received systemic chemotherapy with semustine plus fluorouracil or with fluorouracil alone in a higher dose, administered before and after the pelvic irradiation., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 46 months among surviving patients, patients who received a protracted infusion of fluorouracil had a significantly increased time to relapse (P = 0.01) and improved survival (P = 0.005). There was no evidence of a beneficial effect in the patients who received semustine plus fluorouracil., CONCLUSIONS: A protracted infusion of fluorouracil during pelvic irradiation improved the effect of combined-treatment postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with high-risk rectal cancer. Semustine plus fluorouracil was not more effective than a higher dose of systemic fluorouracil given alone.",Excluded,0.038581878
3018,"Positive psychological outcomes of spaceflight: an empirical study. INTRODUCTION: Anecdotes from astronauts and cosmonauts suggest that spaceflight can be an enriching experience with enduring positive effects. These positive mental health effects may help protect flight crews from the psychological stress inherent in such high-risk missions. The goal of this study was to identify areas of personal growth likely to result from traveling in space and explore how they were patterned., METHODS: We developed a Positive Effects of Being in Space (PEBS) Questionnaire, which included a section adapted from the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) as well as original items addressing experiences unique to spaceflight. We sent the anonymous questionnaire to 175 astronauts and cosmonauts who had flown on at least 1 mission; completed surveys were returned by 39 individuals., RESULTS: Every respondent had a positive reaction to being in space, the strongest of which related to the Earth's beauty and fragility. Respondents reported changes in both attitudes and behaviors. Respondents appeared to cluster into two groups based on the intensity of their reported changes. Response patterns did not vary by demographic group, number of missions flown, or total elapsed time in space., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings support the idea that being in space is a meaningful experience that makes an enduring positive impression on astronauts and cosmonauts. An enhanced understanding of the salutogenic effects of space travel will contribute to the education, training, and support of future space crewmembers.",Excluded,0.038628228
3019,"Hertwig effect caused by UV-irradiation of sperm of Oryzias latipes (teleost) and its photoreactivation. When sperm of the fish Oryzias latipes were irradiated with ultraviolet light and allowed to fertilize normal eggs, the so-called ""Hertwig effect"" was observed, with a dose-dependent decrease in survival rate at low doses (0-27 J . m-2) but a better survival rate at higher dose ranges. Illumination with visible light after fertilization (10-70 min after insemination) showed the existence of photoreactivation (PR), demonstrating that pyrimidine dimers are a lesion in sperm DNA that is mainly responsible for the UV-caused Hertwig effect. Genetic analysis, in which sperm from a wild-type of this fish was used, showed that, after UV-irradiation at the high dose range, male nuclei did not participate in embryonic development (a gynogenetic haploid condition). Embryos having only a maternal set of chromosomes could develop no further than stage 27. Only the visible light during the early part (until around 20-30 min after insemination, at 25 degrees C) of the single-cell stage was effective for PR; illumination thereafter was not.",Excluded,0.050533272

3021,"Influence of preoperative femoral orientation on radiographic measures of femoral head height in total hip replacement. Background: In total hip arthroplasty the surgeon aims to restore the biomechanics of the joint. Femoral height has the greatest influence on restoring limb length and contributes equally to the restoration of femoral head centre. On X-ray, the level of femoral neck resection is most often referenced off the upper border of lesser trochanter. Less frequently, femoral head centre is referenced from the tip of the greater trochanter. The error in measurement of femoral height resulting from unknown femoral rotation is crucially important and can result in inappropriate surgical planning for implant selection and placement. It is unknown which reference produces lower error. Method(s): A sample of femoral shapes was generated using a femoral statistical shape model. These were placed in a range of orientations in terms of external rotation and flexion, at intervals of 10degree. Simulated X-rays were then produced and the distances from the tip of either greater or lesser trochanter to femoral head centre were measured. Finding(s): Although using greater trochanter as a reference demonstrated greater errors at the extremes, both techniques resulted in errors of 7-8 mm with 20degree of both femoral external rotation and flexion. Interpretation(s): Moderate degrees of femoral external rotation combined with flexion can result in unsatisfactory errors when templating limb length. There should be greater focus and an agreed definition for femoral height. There is a clinical need for a method with a lower error in determining true femoral height and the level of neck resection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded,0.03847944

Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of carbon-ion radiation therapy for nonsquamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity in a multicenter study. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of the clinicopathological features and outcomes of 76 patients with oral nonsquamous cell carcinomas with N0-1 M0 status and were treated with carbon-ion radiation therapy at four institutions in Japan between November 2003 and December 2014 was performed. Result(s): Salivary gland carcinoma, mucosal melanoma, and three other carcinomas were found in 46, 27, and 3 patients, respectively. T1-3, T4a, and T4b disease was diagnosed in 27, 18, and 31 patients, respectively. Median follow-up period was 31.1 months (range, 3-118 months). Three-year local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival of all patients were 86.8%, 63.1%, and 78.4%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed T classification (T4) to be a significant independent poor prognostic factor for local control. Acute grade 3 mucositis was observed in 38 patients. Grades 3 and 4 late morbidities were observed in 9 and 4 patients, respectively. No grade 5 late toxicity was observed.

3023,"Clinical results of intraarticular calcaneal fractures in long-term follow-up. Introduction: Clinical results of Calcaneal fractures are often poor because of unsatisfactory reduction, and other problems. In this study, we assessed long-term outcomes after ORIF of intraarticular calcaneal fractures, as well as outcomes of salvage surgery performed for patients with poor outcomes. Method(s): The subjects were 11 patients who were treated with ORIF and followed up for at least 5 years after surgery and 56 patients with poor outcomes, after initial surgery performed at another hospital. Salvage procedures performed for these patients were the lift-up of joint surface (36 feet), arthrodesis (17 feet), and observation without intervention (3 feet). Clinical assessment was based on Maxfield's criteria, and imaging assessment was based on X-ray findings. The mean postoperative follow-up periods were 6. 4 years in ORIF group and 4. 2 years in the lift-up or arthrodesis group. Result(s): ORIF group were excellent for 4 feet, good: 6, fair: 0, poor:1, and osteoarthritic (OA) changes were observed in 2. Lift-up of joint group were excellent: 26, good:7, fair:3, poor:none, OA:3. Arthrodesis group were excellent:11, good:3, fair:3, poor:none. Conclusion(s): If ORIF under the satisfactory reduction is performed, long-term outcomes would be good or excellent without any OA changes. When outcomes of initial surgery are poor, they may complain of pain soon after the initial surgery and require additional salvage surgery within 3 years. Long-term outcomes for calcaneal fractures are greatly affected by satisfactory or unsatisfactory reduction.",Excluded,0.038333382

3025,"High thyroid radiation dose associated with 131-I-19-iodocholesterol adrenal scanning. We have examined two patients undergoing 131I-19-iodocholesterol adrenal scans in order to assess thyroidal radiation dose. Thyroid uptakes of 3--5% of the administered 2 mCi dose were found despite prior administration of Lugol's iodine. Analysis of serum samples over a ten day period after iodocholesterol injection indicated that less than 10% of the radioactivity was free iodide. Kinetic results showed a high value for the thyroid/plasma 131I ratio indicating thyroid retention of 131I. This was substantiated by thyroid scintigrams. The thyroid radiation dose was estimated to be 200--250 rad for the two patients. The associated carcinogenic risk is of sufficient magnitude, in our opinion, to warrant regular follow-up of all patients who have undergone 131I-19-iodocholesterol adrenal scanning.",Excluded,0.039035395
3026,"Feasibility of wide detector CT perfusion imaging performed during routine staging and restaging of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of CT perfusion performed during routine multiphase contrast-enhanced CT on a 160 mm wide-coverage 256-slice scanner in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Method(s): Fifty-seven patients had a CT perfusion acquisition during their routine multiphase CT. Perfusion was performed 5 to 42.5 s (15 passes at 2.5 s intervals) after intravenous contrast administration (4.2-5 ml/s), followed by pancreatic parenchymal and portal venous phases for clinical interpretation. Perfusion maps were generated and blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), and permeability surface area product (PS) for tumor and uninvolved pancreas were calculated using deconvolution algorithms and compared to existing similar publications. Radiation dose information was recorded and size-specific dose estimate (SSDE) was calculated using body dimensions. Result(s): Diagnostic quality of standard images was unaffected by performing the perfusion acquisition. Average tumor center BF was 20.8 +/- 12.1 ml/100 g/min, BV 2.5 +/- 2.1 ml/100 g and PS 15.5 +/- 39.4 ml/100 g/min. Average pancreas BF was 90.8 +/- 50.2 ml/100 g/min, BV 11.9 +/- 4.3 ml/100 g and PS 33.6 +/- 27.7 ml/100 g/min. For the perfusion acquisition, mean SSDE was 57 +/- 11 mGy, CTDIvol 43 +/- 6 mGy and DLP 685 +/- 100 mGy-cm. Conclusion(s): Adding a perfusion CT acquisition to standard pancreatic CT protocol is feasible using a wide-detector 256-slice CT scanner and adds quantitative information while maintaining diagnostic quality of the standard of care examination. This novel protocol adds no time or cost to the examination and yields perfusion parameters that are comparable to existing literature using a separate dedicated perfusion protocol.

To determine how soon radiation-induced lung injury is detectable, to compare the CT findings with those on chest radiographs, and to observe the appearance of the abnormality during the acute phase, we performed 83 CT studies in 17 radiotherapy patients at relatively short intervals. All 17 patients received fractionated radiotherapy to the thorax with a large irradiated lung volume. The CT findings were variable; pulmonary infiltrates were homogeneous, patchy, or discrete. CT abnormalities were evident in 15 of 17 cases within 16 weeks after radiotherapy; in 13 of these it was detected within 4 weeks. In three of these 15 cases, no abnormality was detected on chest radiographs, and in three other cases, the change was observed much later on chest radiographs than on CT scans. In the other nine cases, abnormalities were detected simultaneously on CT scans and chest radiographs. In four cases, extensive radiation pneumonitis was observed on CT, but in two of these, the change was misdiagnosed on the chest radiograph. We conclude that CT is useful in the detection of acute radiation-induced pulmonary disease.",Excluded,0.9411295

Per protocol, patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in an intergroup phase II trial conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group had their cognitive functions measured using the Folstein and Folstein Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and their physical functions measured using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Score (PS) at study entry, at each treatment evaluation, and at quarterly intervals thereafter until disease progression or death. Of the 53 eligible participants who began therapy, 46 (87%) had baseline MMSE scores recorded, 36 (68%) had at least one follow-up MMSE, and 32 (60%) had both, while 52 (98%) had baseline PS, 49 (92%) had at least one follow-up PS, and 48 (91%) had both. Patterns of MMSE and PS values over time were studied in each individual, in the group as a whole, in the 20 patients who completed the study regimen, in the 23 who survived more than a year, and in patients who were classified as nonprogressors at each key evaluation. For each patient, all recorded values were plotted versus time, with dates of disease progression and death included, to look for signs of decline in cognitive or physical function preceding adverse events. Long-term declines in scores of both cognitive and physical function were observed in many treated patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Nearly all patients who were alive more than 52 weeks after study entry had a demonstrable decline in cognitive and physical functionality. Such declines may occur before disease progression is documented; they may also occur in some patients who have long-term follow-up without evidence of disease progression. Declining MMSE and PS was a poor predictor of disease progression. There was no association of PS and toxicity. The data from this study demonstrated the considerable difficulties we encountered conducting an ancillary study such as this within a multicenter clinical trial. Firstly, the test instruments written into the protocol were unable to tell if the declines seen were due to disease, treatment, co-morbidity, or other factors.

3033,"Effects of NKG2D haplotypes on the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on natural killer and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among atomic-bomb survivors. NKG2D is a primary activating receptor that triggers cell-mediated cytotoxicity in NK cells against tumor and virus-infected cells. We previously identified the NKG2D haplotypes in the natural killer gene complex region on chromosome 12p. Two major haplotype alleles, LNK1 and HNK1, were closely related to low and high natural cytotoxic activity phenotypes, respectively. Furthermore, the haplotype of HNK1/HNK1 has revealed a decreased risk of cancer compared with LNK1/LNK1. In the present study, using flow cytometry, we evaluated the functional effects of NKG2D haplotypes and five htSNPs in terms of the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among 732 atomic-bomb survivors. NKG2D expression on NK cells showed significant increases, in the order of LNK1/LNK1, LNK1/HNK1 and HNK1/HNK1 haplotypes (p for trend = 0.003), or with major homozygous, heterozygous, and minor homozygous genotypes for individual htSNPs (p for trend = 0.02-0.003).

Age- and gender-related changes in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in rat livers exposed to different doses of whole-body gamma-ray radiation were determined. In addition, the effects of exogenous glutathione (GSH) against radiation injury in rat livers were investigated. We found that MDA levels have an age-associated increment and an increasing radiation dose-related elevation, although they decrease slightly in the 4 Gy group. The MDA levels in old rats were lower in males than in females, while those of young rats did not change. There were no observed age-related changes in SOD activities, although male rats had higher SOD activity than females. Female rats had the highest CAT activities in the 4 Gy group, while male rats had the highest CAT activities in the 6 Gy group. CAT activities in the 8 Gy group were lower than those of the 2 Gy group for each gender and age. While MDA levels were decreased and CAT activities increased by GSH, SOD activities remained unchanged. The results indicate that gamma-ray radiation affects gender- and age-dependent MDA levels, SOD and CAT activities.

Premature chromosome condensation (PCC) from X-ray induced micronuclei shows a dose-effect relationship in human leukocytes in vitro. Preparations at different culture times without colcemide treatment reveal complex variations of the frequencies of micronuclei and PCC correlated with the fixation time. The positions of PCC patches in the metaphase plate and the frequencies of different PCC types (S and G2) ar independent on the X-ray dose. The latter indicates that the slowing down of the micronuclei in the cell cycle, which is the reason for the formation of PCC, may be an outcome rather of a regulatory phenomenon than of an unspecific physiological damage of the chromatin included in the micronuclei. This is especially evident from labeling experiments with tritiated thymidine, showing that the extent of asynchrony between main nuclei and micronuclei is independent on the X-ray dose. Labeling experiments with tritiated uridine reveal a X-ray dose dependent suppression of RNA synthesis in cells with main nuclei and micronuclei. THE S-phase nature of ""pulverized"" PCC patches could be verified by incorporation of tritiated thymidine in aound 50%.

BACKGROUND: Decision Support Systems, based on statistical prediction models, have the potential to change the way medicine is being practiced, but their application is currently hampered by the astonishing lack of impact studies. Showing the theoretical benefit of using these models could stimulate conductance of such studies. In addition, it would pave the way for developing more advanced models, based on genomics, proteomics and imaging information, to further improve the performance of the models., PURPOSE: In this prospective single-center study, previously developed and validated statistical models were used to predict the two-year survival (2yrS), dyspnea (DPN), and dysphagia (DPH) outcomes for lung cancer patients treated with chemo radiation. These predictions were compared to probabilities provided by doctors and guideline-based recommendations currently used. We hypothesized that model predictions would significantly outperform predictions from doctors., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experienced radiation oncologists (ROs) predicted all outcomes at two timepoints: (1) after the first consultation of the patient, and (2) after the radiation treatment plan was made. Differences in the performances of doctors and models were assessed using Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis., RESULTS: A total number of 155 patients were included. At timepoint #1 the differences in AUCs between the ROs and the models were 0.15, 0.17, and 0.20 (for 2yrS, DPN, and DPH, respectively), with p-values of 0.02, 0.07, and 0.03. Comparable differences at timepoint #2 were not statistically significant due to the limited number of patients. Comparison to guideline-based recommendations also favored the models., CONCLUSION: The models substantially outperformed ROs' predictions and guideline-based recommendations currently used in clinical practice. Identification of risk groups on the basis of the models facilitates individualized treatment, and should be further investigated in clinical impact studies. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Between 1/2003 and 9/2010, 84 patients were treated with radical radiochemotherapy at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana, Slovenia. The treatment consisted of 3-dimensional conformal external beam radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and mytomycin C), followed by brachytherapy or external beam boost. The toxicity of therapy and its effectiveness were assessed.Results. The treatment was completed according to the protocol in 79.8% of patients. The median follow-up time of 55 survivors was 53 months (range: 16-105 months). The 5-year locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), overall survival (OS) and colostomy-free survival (CFS) rates were 71%, 68%, 81%, 67% and 85%, respectively.

Objective: The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of low-tube-voltage computed tomography (CT) venography on qualitative and quantitative image parameters and the radiation dose. Method(s): Eighty-eight studies on 84 patients underwent pelvic and lower-extremity CT venography under protocol A (standard 120 kV with 150 mL of contrast material, n = 44) or protocol B (80 kV with 100 mL of contrast material, n = 44) on a 64-detector CT scanner. We compared the dose length product in the 2 protocols. Two blinded observers measured CT attenuation in the veins, the image noise, contrast-to-noise ratio, and figure of merit. Result(s): The mean dose length product was significantly lower under protocol B than A (603.2 [SD, 67.2] vs 1131.7 [SD, 67.0] mGy x cm) (P < 0.01). Mean CT attenuation of the veins was significantly greater with protocol B (125.3 [SD, 16.2] vs 106.1 [SD, 16.0] Hounsfield units) (P < 0.01), and the mean image noise was also significantly higher under protocol B (6.6 [SD, 0.8] vs 4.9 [SD, 0.7] Hounsfield units) (P < 0.01). There was no difference in contrast-to-noise ratio (P = 0.46). Figure of merit was significantly higher under protocol B (P < 0.01).

BACKGROUND: Local control rates of T1 and T2 glottic carcinoma treated with radiation alone were reported as 80-91% and 63-76%, respectively. The authors investigated the factors that affect the local control rate for early glottic carcinoma., METHODS: From 1967 through 1982, 330 patients with early glottic carcinoma (T1: 274 patients; T2: 56) were treated with telecobalt therapy at the Department of Radiology, Osaka University Hospital, Osaka, Japan., RESULTS: Five-year actuarial survival rates of patients with T1 and T2 were 79% and 80%, respectively. Five-year local disease control rates of patients with T1 and T2 disease were 81% and 67%, respectively. In 243 of 254 patients treated with 2 Gy a day, tumor response could be evaluated at the dose level of 40 Gy. For tumors treated with a daily dose of 2 Gy, local control rates of 153 tumors that disappeared at 40 Gy and 90 tumors that persisted at 40 Gy were 83% and 62%, respectively (P < 0.001).

3047,"Study design for a case-control investigation of cellular telephones and other risk factors for brain tumours in adults. The aetiology of brain tumours is poorly understood. Due, in part, to public concern about a postulated relationship between the use of cellular telephones or other increasingly prevalent environmental exposures and the incidence of brain cancer in adults, the National Cancer Institute is collaborating with three US hospitals in a comprehensive case-control study of malignant and benign brain tumours. Factors under consideration include use of cellular phones and other wireless communication devices, workplace exposures to chemical agents and electromagnetic fields, dietary factors, family history of tumours, genetic determinants of susceptibility, home appliance use, reproductive history and hormonal exposures, viruses, medical and dental exposure to ionising radiation, and other aspects of medical history. Approximately 800 newly diagnosed brain tumour cases and 800 controls were enrolled at hospitals in Boston, Phoenix and Pittsburgh from 1994 to 1998. Cases include all adults (age >= 18 y) newly diagnosed with a histologically confirmed intracranial glioma, histologically confirmed intracranial meningioma or acoustic neuroma. Controls are patients admitted to the same hospitals as the cases, and treated for any of a variety of non-malignant conditions. Key features of the study include its large size, the emphasis on rapid ascertainment of incident cases and interview of study subjects rather than surrogate respondents, the use of detailed, job-specific questions developed by industrial hygienists to ascertain occupational exposures, and the storage of blood samples for future evaluation of inherited susceptibility, biomarkers of exposure and gene-environment interactions.",Excluded,0.06887651
3048,"A hybrid iterative reconstruction algorithm that improves the image quality of low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether a hybrid iterative reconstruction (HIR) algorithm improves image quality at low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography (CTA) compared with filtered back projection (FBP)., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients (seven men, 11 women; mean age, 67.8 years) underwent retrospectively gated coronary CTA at 80 kV with a volume CT dose index (CTDI(vol)) of 18.8 mGy on a 64-MDCT scanner. CT images were reconstructed using only FBP and only HIR. For each patient, CT images subjected to the two different reconstructions were reviewed by two observers. Quantitative image quality parameters-that is, CT attenuation (HU) of the coronary arteries, image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)-were calculated and compared for the two reconstruction methods and the overall image quality for each reconstruction was visually scored on a 5-point scale., RESULTS: The mean estimated effective radiation dose for 80-kV coronary CTA was 4.7 +/- 0.4 (SD) mSv. The two reconstruction methods did not significantly differ with respect to the CT attenuation of the coronary arteries. The image noise was significantly lower with HIR than with FBP (20.3 +/- 5.3 vs 49.4 +/- 12.0 HU, respectively; p < 0.01), and the CNR was significantly higher with HIR than with FBP (29.8 +/- 7.4 vs 12.7 +/- 2.9, p < 0.01). The visual scores for image quality were higher with HIR than with FBP (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: The HIR algorithm can reduce image noise and improve image quality at low-tube-voltage coronary CTA.",Excluded,0.038777944
3049,"A non-invasive citogenetic biomarker for colorectal neoplastia prediction. INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to identify a feasible, non-invasive method to predict the presence of significant colorectal neoplastic lesions in patients undergoing colonoscopy. AIMS&METHODS: We included patients about to have colonoscopy in our departments between January 2011 and March 2012. Patients with known neoplastic disease, inflammatory bowel disease or prior radiation exposure were excluded. Blood samples for cytogenetic analysis using Cytogenetic-Bloked Micronucleus Assay (CBMN) technique were taken from patients. An expression of lymphocytic proliferation in specific stimulated cultures - the Nuclear Division Index (NDI) - was calculated trough this method. NDI represents a measure of general cytotoxicity. For statistics we used SPSS 11.0 software. RESULT(S): 94 patients were included. Their mean age was 55.1 years, men and women were equally represented, 47 each (50%). There were: 37 patients with normal colonoscopy, 4 patients with hyperplastic polyps, 30 patients with adenomas (from these 9 were advanced: size over 10mm, with high grade dysplasia or with a villous component larger than 25%), 23 patients with colorectal cancer. NDI was significantly lower in patients with adenomas and cancer than in patients with normal colonoscopy or hyperplastic polyps (AUC ROC = 0.637, p = 0.036). Secondly, NDI was also significantly lower in patients with advanced adenomas or cancer than in patients with normal colonoscopy, hyperplastic polyps or non-advanced adenomas (AUC ROC = 0.0677, p = 0.005). Finally, patients with colorectal cancer had a significantly lower NDI than patients with no colorectal cancer (AUC ROC = 0.655, p= 0.026).

3050,"Significance of Fuchs Flecks in Patients With Pterygium/Pinguecula: Earliest Indicator of Ultraviolet Light Damage. PURPOSE: Fuchs flecks (FFs) have been previously identified at the leading edge of pterygia and may represent collections of epithelial stem-like cells that give rise to this condition. This study aims to evaluate the clinical significance of FFs in patients with ocular surface disorders, such as pterygium and pinguecula, by in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM)., METHODS: This study is a Single-center, retrospective, observational case series of 40 eyes from 20 patients with clinical diagnoses of pinguecula or pterygium, or both. IVCM (Rostock Cornea Module; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) was performed on patients with pinguecula or pterygium, or both. The presence of FFs on the ocular surface of patients with pterygium and pinguecula was assessed by IVCM and subsequently documented., RESULTS: FFs were present in 24 of 30 eyes (80.0%) in paired macroscopically normal nasal or limbal regions, 19 of 20 (95.0%) in pinguecula, 13 of 15 (86.7%) in primary pterygia, and 7 of 7 (100%) in recurrent pterygia., CONCLUSIONS: High rates of FFs were identified at the head of pinguecula, primary pterygium, recurrent pterygium, and macroscopically normal nasal and temporal limbus. We postulate that FFs may represent precursor lesions to UV-associated ocular surface pathology.

3051,"Low contrast and radiation dose coronary CT angiography using a 320-row system and a refined contrast injection and timing method. BACKGROUND: Among CT scanners, 320-row instruments feature decreased photon energy and yield strong contrast enhancement. Consequently, the contrast medium (CM) dose can be reduced. The results of low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography (CCTA) performed on 320-row scanners have not been adequately assessed., OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effects of a low-contrast-dose protocol on the image quality of CCTA using 80 kVp tube voltage, iterative reconstruction (IR), and a 320-row scanner., METHODS: We randomly assigned 90 patients (mean body weight, 56.5 +/- 11.0 kg) to 1 of 3 CCTA protocols. Under protocol A, 30 were scanned using a conventional 120-kVp protocol and a standard CM dose (280 mg iodine/kg body weight [mgI/kg]). Another 30 underwent scanning at 80 kVp with a 25% CM dose reduction (210 mgI/kg; protocol B). Under protocol C, the remaining 30 patients were scanned at 80 kVp with a 50% CM dose reduction (140 mgI/kg). The 120 and 80 kVp images were processed with IR. Images obtained under the 3 protocols were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis., RESULTS: The amount of CM used in protocol A, B, and C was 43.6 +/- 10.1, 30.3 +/- 4.4, and 21.0 +/- 4.0 mL, respectively. Mean CT attenuation of the coronary arteries tended to be higher under protocol B than the other 2 protocols. The contrast-to-noise ratio was significantly higher under protocol B. The mean visual scores were significantly higher for protocols A and B than protocol C. The mean effective radiation dose was significantly lower under the 80-kVp protocol., CONCLUSION: With a 320-row scanner and our refined CM injection and timing protocol, it is technically feasible to obtain sufficient vascular enhancement with a reduction in the CM and/or radiation dose at 80-kVp CCTA with IR.

3052,"Incidental pancreatic cystic lesions: comparison between CT with model-based algorithm and MRI. Introduction: The present study aims to compare low-kV CT reconstructed with MBIR technique with MRI in detecting high-risk stigmata and worrisome features in patients with pancreatic cystic lesions. Method(s): We retrospective enrolled 75 patients who underwent low-kV CT with contrast media injection for general abdominal disorders and MRI with MRCP sequences. The reviewer, blinded to clinical and histopathological data, recorded the overall number of pancreatic cystic lesions, size, location, presence of calcifications, septa, or solid enhancing or non-enhancing components, main pancreatic duct (MPD) communication, and MPD dilatation. Mean differences with 95% limits of agreement, ICC, and kappa statistics were used to compare CT and MRI. Result(s): More pancreatic cystic lesions were detected with MRI than with CT, however, the ICC value of 0.81 suggested a good agreement. According to the evaluated target lesion, a very good agreement (ICC = 0.98) was found regarding the diameter (21.4 mm CT vs 21.8 mm MRI), the location (kappa = 0.90), the detection of MPD dilatation (kappa = 1), the presence of septa (kappa = 0.86) and the MPD communication (kappa = 0.87). A moderate agreement on the assessment of enhanced components was noted (kappa = 0.44), while there was only a fair agreement about the presence of calcifications (kappa = 0.87). Conclusion(s): MDCT can be considered almost equivalent to MRI with MRCP in the evaluation of worrisome features and high-risk stigmata, offering detailed morphologic features helpful for their characterization. Implications for practice: Even if MRI is considered the reference standard in pancreatic cystic lesions characterization, CT can be considered a useful tool as a first-line imaging technique to identify worrisome features and high-risk stigmata.Copyright © 2020 The College of Radiographers",Excluded,0.038226563

PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and the imaging features of routine admission chest X-ray in patients suspected for novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) infection., METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated clinical and X-ray features in all patients referred to the emergency department for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1st and March 13th. A single radiologist with more than 15 years of experience in chest-imaging evaluated the presence and extent of alveolar opacities, reticulations, and/or pleural effusion. The percentage of lung involvement (range <25 % to 75-100 %) was also calculated. We stratified patients in groups according to the time interval between symptoms onset and X-ray imaging (<= 5 and > 5 days) and according to age (<= 50 and > 50 years old)., RESULTS: A total of 518 patients were enrolled. Overall 314 patients had negative and 204 had positive RT-PCR results. Lung lesions in patients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia primarily manifested as alveolar and interstitial opacities and were mainly bilateral (60.8 %). Lung abnormalities were more frequent and more severe by symptom duration and by increasing age. The sensitivity and specificity of chest X-ray at admission in the overall cohort were 57 % (95 % CI=47-67) and 89 % (83-94), respectively. Sensitivity was higher for patients with symptom onset > 5 days compared to <= 5 days (76 % [62-87] vs 37 % [24-52]) and in patients > 50 years old compared to <= 50 years (59 % [48-69] vs 47 % [23-72]), at the expense of a slightly lower specificity (68 % [45-86] and 82 % [73-89], respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Overall chest X-ray sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia was 57 %. Sensitivity was higher when symptoms had started more than 5 days before, at the expense of lesser specificity, while slightly higher in older patients in comparison to younger ones.

Objective To establish molecular diagnosis for a family with a complicated form of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with intellectual disability, cognitive decline, psychosis, peripheral neuropathy, upward gaze palsy, and thin corpus callosum (TCC). Methods Physical examinations, laboratory tests, structural neuroimaging studies, and exome sequence analysis were carried out. Results The 3 patients exhibited intellectual disability and progressive intellectual decline accompanied by psychiatric symptoms. Gait difficulty with spasticity and pyramidal weakness appeared at the ages of 20s-30s. Brain MRI revealed TCC with atrophic changes in the frontotemporal lobes, caudate nuclei, and cerebellum. Exome sequence analysis revealed a novel homozygous c.2654C>A (p.

In an image-intensifier angiographic system, the tube potential is commonly regulated in ranges from 75 to 90 kV for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and fluoroscopy in transarterial chemoembolization therapy (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not a 120-kV tube potential could be used for DSA and fluoroscopy in TACE to decrease the skin dose. Forty-three patients administered TACE were randomly allocated into two groups: TACE was performed using standard-kilovoltage (75- to 90-kV) DSA and fluoroscopy modes (group A; n = 20) or using high-kilovoltage (120-kV) modes (group B; n = 23). The peak skin dose was compared between the groups. One case in group A was excluded from the study because the HCC nodule was not depicted on DSA. The peak skin dose (mGy) for group A was 383.6 +/- 176.5 and that for group B was 265.1 +/- 145.1. The peak skin dose was decreased by 31% in the 120-kV mode, a statistically significant difference (t-test, p = 0.022). We conclude that the use of 120 kV tube potential for DSA and fluoroscopy may be one option for performing TACE while decreasing the skin dose. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded,0.03830047

Study Design.Retrospective study of postoperative outcomes of adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery.Objective.To clarify the differences in postoperative outcomes depending on the presence or absence of thoracic compensatory changes among patients with a T1 slope (TS) more than 40degree.Summary of Background Data.Loss correction after ASD surgery is more likely to occur when preoperative TS is more than 40degree. When preoperative TS is more than 40degree, some cases involve compensatory changes in the thoracic spine and decreased thoracic kyphosis (TK); others involve increased TK without compensatory changes.Methods.Seventy-nine patients with TS more than 40degree who underwent ASD surgery were enrolled and separated into compensated and noncompensated groups (group C: TK <40degree; group NC: TK >=40degree). Radiographic parameters obtained by whole-spine standing x-ray, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) questionnaire were assessed.Results.There were 41 patients in group C and 38 patients in group NC. Preoperative significant differences in TS did not disappear after surgery (preoperative TS: group C and group NC=46degree and 55degree, P<0.001; just after surgery: group C and group NC=27degree and 40degree, P<0.001; 2 years later: group C and group NC=34degree and 47degree, P<0.001). There were no significant differences in ODI and all domains of the SRS-22 before surgery. However, 2 years after the surgery, ODI (38%), pain (3.5), self-image (3.0), and total (3.2) values of the SRS-22 for group NC were significantly worse than those (28%, 4.0, 3.4, and 3.5, respectively) for group C (P<0.05).Conclusion.Changes in the thoracic spine (TS and TK >40degree) result in poor postoperative outcomes. Extending the upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) to the upper thoracic spine must be considered. Even when TS is more than 40degree, TK less than 40degree, and upper instrumented vertebra set to the lower thoracic level result in good postoperative outcomes.

3062,"Gluteus maximus turnover flap for sacral osteomyelitis after radiation therapy. Developments in radiation therapy modalities offer alternative treatments for un-resectable malignant tumors in the pelvis and trunk. However, poor vascularity as a result of radiation therapy makes the treated lesion susceptible to infection, and there are no established treatments for pelvic osteomyelitis with a large dead space after radiation therapy. The authors report 2 cases of sacral osteomyelitis after radiation therapy that were treated successfully with a gluteus maximus turnover flap. To create the flap, the distal portion of the lower third of the muscle was detached from the trochanter. The distal edge of the flap was turned toward the sacral defect and sewn to the remnant of the sacrum, which filled the dead space with the muscle bulk. A 68-year-old man with a recurrent sacral chordoma was treated with carbon ion radiation therapy; however, a sacral infection developed 5 months later. De-bridement and a course of antibiotics could not control the infection and did not induce sufficient formation of granulation tissue in the large and deep dead space. The turnover flap with both gluteus maximus muscles cured the deep-seated infec-tion and closed the wound. A 58-year-old woman had sacral osteoradionecrosis with infection. A turnover flap created with the left gluteus maximus muscle controlled the infection and closed the wound after the first operation, a V-Y flap, failed. This study showed that a gluteus maximus muscle turnover flap effectively controlled infectious lesions with large and deep dead space around the sacrum.Copyright © SLACK Incorporated.",Excluded,0.03828307

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to determine the impact of direct stenting (DS) on procedural success and the in-hospital outcome among patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)., BACKGROUND: With improvements in stent designs, DS has become more widespread. The theoretical advantages of DS include a shorter procedural time, a lower contrast dose, and reduced spiral dissections, along with reduced radiation exposure and procedural costs., METHODS: A total of 1992 consecutive STEMI patients were reviewed; 621 patients (31.2%) were included in the DS group and 1371 (68.8%) in the conventional stenting (CS) group. The clinical and angiographic characteristics, in-hospital outcomes, and predictors of unsuccessful primary angioplasty were analyzed., RESULTS: The incidence of in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was 6.1% in the CS group and 4.3% in the DS group. The difference between the two patient groups was not statistically significant for myocardial reinfarction (re-MI), target-vessel revascularization, and MACE.

3065,"Preoperative oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and external beam radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed, primary operable, cT3NxMo, low rectal cancer: A phase II study. Purpose: In patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), preoperative chemoradiation is known to improve local control, and down-staging of the tumor serves as a surrogate for survival. Intensification of the systemic therapy may lead to higher down- staging rates and, thus, enhance survival. This phase II study investigated the efficacy and safety of preoperative capecitabine and oxaliplatin in combination with radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: Patients with LARC of the mid and lower rectum, T3NxM0 staged by MRI received radiotherapy (total dose 45 Gy) in combination with oral capecitabine (825 mg/m2 twice a day on radiotherapy days; weeks 1-4) and oxaliplatin 50 mg/m2 intravenously (days 1, 8, 15, and 22). Efficacy was evaluated as rate of tumor down-categorization at the T level. Result(s): A total of 59 patients were enrolled (19 women, 40 men; median age of 61 years) and all were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity. Down-categorization at the T level was observed in 53% with pathological complete response in 6 patients (10%). Actual total radiotherapy, oxaliplatin and capecitabine doses received were 97%, 90%, and 93% of the protocol-specified preplanned doses, respectively. Grade 3/4 toxicity was observed in 15 patients (25%). The most frequent was diarrhea (12%). Conclusion(s): Preoperative chemoradiation with capecitabine and oxaliplatin is feasible in patients with MRI-proven cT3 LARC. The only clinically relevant toxicity was diarrhea.

Dose estimations were done on 1045 patients (aged, 39.6 +/- 10.6 y; range 18-85 y) involving 501 (47.9%) males and 544 (52.1%) females for a total of 1495 individual projections. The entrance surface dose (ESD) for the patients was assessed by an indirect method, using the patient's anatomical data and exposure parameters utilised for the specific examination and a Quality Assurance Dose Database software developed by Integrated Radiological Services Ltd in Liverpool, UK. The study showed variations in the ESDs for chest examinations with five of the hospitals having values above the internationally recommended levels. ESDs for lumbar spine anterior-posterior and lateral projections were within acceptable limits. Diagnostic reference levels proposed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection based on patient dose data are imperative to the current Ghanaian situation and will lead to a reduction of the radiation dose.",Excluded,0.038547248
3068,"Analysis of causal models of diet for patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiation therapy. Purpose: This study seeks to establish causal models of diet which maintain the appetite of head and neck cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. Sample and methods: We collected data from 208 patients at two radiation doses, 30/50 Gy, using a questionnaire on appetite and analyzed the items using structural equation modeling. Result(s): In the causal model for 30 Gy, we established a path using the four intervening variables "" ease of consuming foods in smooth forms,"" "" ease of consuming foods with a chewable texture and suitable temperature,"" "" ease of consuming lightly seasoned foods with a flavorful smell,"" and "" overall ease of consuming a given meal"" from the temporal relationship between "" dietary preferences"" and "" maintaining appetite while caring for the oral cavity."" In the causal model for 50 Gy, we established a path between "" ease of consuming foods with a mild temperature and smell,"" and "" maintaining appetite while caring for the oral cavity"" using the four intervening variables "" ease of consuming foods that are easy to swallow,"" "" ease of consuming foods that dissolve well in the mouth,"" "" ease of consuming foods with a mild taste,"" and "" overall ease of consuming a given meal."" The goodness of fit indices for both models were above 0.85 for both the goodness of fit index (GFI) and adjusted GFI (AGFI), and less than 0.08 for root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), indicating a satisfactory goodness of fit.

In this paper, some final results of 25-year investigations carried out in Scientific Centre for Radiation Medicine and Burns MH RA (SCRMB) on the Armenian cohort of the Chernobyl accident consequences liquidators are shown. These results show that health conditions of the liquidators became worse during the whole observation period. A considerable development of both pathological states atypical of radiation damages and diseases, which may be considered as radiation-induced ones, was determined. Rise of the sickness rate of almost all organism systems, first of all, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive ones, was observed. In 70% of liquidators the main disease was primarily detected after working on CNPP. In the intervening years, the average number of diagnoses per 1 liquidator increased from 1.5 in 1987 to 7-8 in the recent time. In addition to the detected diseases, particular functional shifts in neuropsychological and vegetative status of the liquidators were observed. The overwhelming majority of them have increased tonicity of the sympathetic vegetative nervous system, asthenic and depressive syndromes occurring in the form of weakness, somnolence, mood instability, mental capacity decrease, and memory defects. In the paper, the results of investigations aimed at clarification of changes in biological aging processes of the liquidators and assessment of their ""life quality"" features in terms of physical, psychical and social welfare are considered. Biological aged-related passportization in a definite part of liquidators elucidated an accelerated aging rate. The studies were performed with the help of SF-36 inquirer and indicated that health status aggravation of the liquidators also affected their life satisfaction.

3070,"Salvage high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy for locally recurrent rectal cancer: Long-term follow-up results. Background: We retrospectively examined outcomes of salvage high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (HDR-ISBT) for locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC). Method(s): Nine patients with LRRC were treated with salvage HDR-ISBT. Their median age was 63 years. The median maximum diameter of LRRC was 40 mm (range 20-80 mm). Adenocarcinomas were histologically confirmed in all cases. The prescribed dose was 30 Gy/5 fractions/3 days to 50 Gy/10 fractions/6 days in the combined external-beam radiotherapy group (four patients) and 54 Gy/9 fractions/5 days to 60 Gy/10 fractions/6 days in the monotherapeutic group (five patients). Median follow-up time was 90 months (range 6-221 months). Result(s): Local control at final follow-up was achieved in five of nine patients. Of these five patients, one experienced a locally re-recurrent tumor in the vaginal wall 33 months after treatment and received re-HDR-ISBT as re-salvage treatment. The 8-year overall survival, local control, and progression-free survival rates were 56, 44, and 33 %, respectively. Based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ver. 4.03, the following Grade 3 adverse events were observed in three patients (>=3 months): Grade 3 skin ulceration in one patient who showed tumor invasion of the skin and whose V100 was 400 cc; Grade 3 vaginal perforation in one patient whose tumor had invaded the vaginal wall; and Grade 3 vagina-to-bladder fistula in one patient whose tumor received re-irradiation.

3071,"Utility of new bioabsorptive screws in cervical anterior fusion. Background: The aim of this study is to report our use of new bioabsorbable screws in cervical anterior fusion. These screws need not be removed because they are completely absorbed by resolution in vivo. We describe our method and the new bioabsorbable screws. Method(s): We used PLLA screws until September 2004 and uncalcined uHA-PLLA screws thereafter. They are completely absorbed by resolution to water and carbon dioxide upon in vivo hydrolysis. The uHA-PLLA screws are x-ray impenetrable, and their uHA content renders them osteoconductive. In cervical anterior fusion, the graft is inserted in the area of deletion resulting from decompression. The screws are inserted in the 4 corners of the vertebral body and graft. In long fusion, they are introduced in the 2 lateral wings of the bone graft on each vertebral body and in the 4 corners. Our method eliminates the need for plates or mesh. Result(s): We have used this method in 62 patients and encountered no complications. There were no screw or graft extrusions and no surgery-related infections. The patients were able to walk a few hours after the operation and wore a simple neck collar for a few days.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the accuracy of ultrasonography (US) in the diagnosis of intestinal anisakiasis presenting as small bowel obstruction., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical features, US examinations, and CT scans of seven patients with intestinal anisakiasis presenting as small bowel obstruction. We compared the performances of US and CT in demonstrating peritoneal fluid, small bowel dilatation, and segmental edema of Kerckring's folds., RESULTS: All patients presented with a history of ingesting raw saltwater fish or squid less than 2 days prior to presentation at the emergency department and had significant levels of Anisakis-specific IgE. Both US and CT revealed small bowel obstruction, with dilated small bowel in all patients and accumulations of free peritoneal fluid in six patients. CT showed segmental wall thickening and luminal narrowing with submucosal edema distal to the distended small bowel; US did so in four patients., CONCLUSIONS: Although US was inferior to CT in demonstrating the segmental intestinal edema causing small bowel obstruction, it can be applied in suspected cases of intestinal anisakiasis presenting as small bowel obstruction, particularly where CT is unavailable or there are concerns about radiation exposure.

To clarify the relationship between dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters and radiation pneumonitis (RP) after surgery in cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with induction concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Patients with NSCLC treated with induction CCRT (chemotherapy: cisplatin and docetaxel; radiotherapy: 2.0 Gy fractions once daily for a total of 46 Gy) before surgery were reviewed. We calculated the percentage of lung volume receiving at least 20 Gy (V20) and the mean lung dose (MLD) for the total lung volume and the lung remaining after resection. Factors affecting the incidence of RP at grade 2 or higher (>= G2 RP) were analyzed. Eighteen of 49 patients (37%) experienced >=G2 RP. The V20 and MLD for the lung remaining after resection (V20r and MLDr) were significant predictors according to the multivariate analysis (p=0.007 and 0.041, respectively). The incidence of >=G2 RP was 8% in patients with V20r<10%, and 13% in patients with MLDr<5.6 Gy, respectively. The optimal approach to reduce the rate of postoperative RP in patients with induction CCRT for NSCLC is to keep the V20r below 10% and/or the MLDr below 5.6 Gy in the radiotherapy planning.",Excluded,0.039023805
3074,"Effectiveness of Nd: YAG laser therapy on Japanese cedar pollinosis. Many have reported on the effectiveness of laser surgery therapy for perennial allergic rhinitis. However, the suppressive effects of laser irradiation on allergic rhinitis and its symptoms have not been reported in patients with pollinosis. This is because therapeutic effects on pollinosis are difficult to evaluate. The amount of pollen in the air varies during the year, and from year to year. Also, allergic symptoms develop due to exposure to the amount of pollen which is markedly influenced by the weather. In this study, the severity of allergic symptoms in the pollen season was compared between patients treated with early medication, non-treated patients and patients treated with preseasonal contact Nd: YAG laser surgery. Results suggests that laser surgery was effective in reducing the severity of symptoms in patients with cedar pollinosis. Symptoms were milder in the laser group than in the medication group and non-treated group for 3-4 weeks after the start of seasonal pollinosis, although no differences were noted in the early weeks. This may be explained by the fact that laser irradiation reduces the lamina propria of the nasal mucosa, the site of allergic reactions. This also suggests that allergic pollen can't penetrate the mucosal surface which shows squamous epithelization after laser irradiation.",Excluded,0.04753738

INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the efficacy of combined endoscopic lithotomy and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), and additional electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) as needed, for the treatment of pancreatic duct stones, we retrospectively evaluated 98 patients with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic lithiasis., METHODS: For the management of main pancreatic duct (MPD) stones in 98 patients, we performed combined endoscopic treatment (ET)/ESWL therapy as the first treatment option. When combined ET/ESWL was unsuccessful, EHL with the SpyGlass Direct Visualization system or X-ray guided EHL was performed. Outpatient ESWL was reserved as one of the final treatment options., RESULTS: Fragmentation was successful in 80 (81.6%) patients as follows: combined ET/ESWL: 67 cases; SpyGlass EHL: 4 cases; X-ray guided EHL: 3 cases; and outpatient ESWL: 6 cases. Successful outcome was obtained by combined ET/ESWL in 67 of the 98 patients (74.5%), by EHL in 7 of 14 patients (7.1%), and by outpatient ESWL in 6 of 6 patients (6.1%).

Platelet aggregation after adenosine diphosphate stimulation was studied in the platelet rich plasma obtained from 37 patients who underwent left ventriculography using the highly sensitive method of particle counting with laser-light scattering. Platelet activation by contrast media was studied in the platelet rich plasma from healthy volunteers using flow cytometric analysis to detect platelet degranulation as P-selectin expression. There was a significant decrease in platelet aggregation in patients injected with ioxilan or iomeprol compared with patients injected with iohexol. There was a significant increase in P-selectin expression with the three groups of contrast media compared to control. The platelet activation with ioxilan or iomeprol was significantly less compared to the activation with iohexol. The comparison showed that previous generalization regarding platelet activation by nonionic contrast media might not be valid. It is presumed that the higher osmolality of iohexol may contribute to the increase in platelet aggregation and activation.",Excluded,0.09533078

In four patients highly suspected of having delayed radiation necrosis of the brain, regional cerebral blood flow and metabolism were studied by using positron emission tomography (PET) with the 15O-labelled gases, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG). All four patients showed marked decreases in glucose and oxygen consumption in the lesion with that suspected pathology in comparison with those in normal brain parenchyma. Two of them were histologically proved to have radiation injuries (one was radiation necrosis and another was early delayed reactions). But one patient was histologically proved to have a recurrent tumor. Although metabolic study with PET using 18FDG is generally an excellent procedure for differentiation between radiation injuries and recurrent brain tumor, these results imply that in some cases the differential diagnosis is difficult even with 18FDG. The present study demonstrated considerably more pronounced reduction in the metabolism than the decrease of the blood flow in the lesion with radiation necrosis. This result would indicate that the primary effect causing the radiation necrosis is a direct effect of irradiation on neural tissue rather than the capillary damage.",Excluded,0.9527984

Age is an important prognostic factor in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). In this study, we investigated the difference in prognosis of 7 subsets of PTC patients without distant metastasis at presentation or a history of radiation exposure (20 years or younger, 21-30 years, 31-40 years, 41-50 years, 51-60 years, 61-70 years, and older than 70 years). The lymph node recurrence rate was high in patients 20 years or younger and those older than 60 years. Distant recurrence and carcinoma death rates significantly elevated in patients older than 60 years. The incidence of significant extrathyroid extension markedly increased with age, although that of large node metastasis or extranodal tumor extension did not differ much among the 7 subsets. With the Kaplan-Meier method, lymph node recurrence rate was poor in patients 20 years or younger and in those older than 60 years. Poor distant recurrence-free and cause specific survivals of patients older than 60 years were identified in the series of PTC patients with and without these aggressive features. It is therefore suggested that 1) Lymph node recurrence rate was high in patients 20 years or younger and those older than 60 years and 2) prognosis, including distant recurrence-free survival and cause-specific survival, of patients older than 60 years was poor regardless of clinicopathological features of PTC at initial surgery.",Excluded,0.039474547

By X-ray examination, cartilage destruction is evaluated as a joint space narrowing (JSN). However, joint space narrowing is not a direct evaluation of cartilage. Objective(s): The aim of the study was to examine the finger joint cartilage by ultrasound (US) imaging and to compare it with JSN score in relation to clinical relevance. Method(s): We enrolled 27 RA patients in low disease activity or clinical remission (DAS28-CRP <2.7) and 21 healthy controls in this study. The cartilage thickness (CT) of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of 2nd to 5th fingers was bilaterally visualized and measured from a dorsal view, with approximately 90 degrees flexion. In addition, JSN of finger were scored by van der Heijde- modified Sharp method. Result(s): In patients with RA, CT in MCP joints ranged from 0.0 to 0.8 mm (median 0.4 mm), and CT in PIP ranged from 0.0 to 0.4mm (median 0.2mm), respectively. The sum of total CT from 8 fingers ranged from 2.7 to 6.8 mm (median 4.7 mm), and there was a significant difference in CT, but not in JSN score, between male and female patients (5.6 versus 4.6, respectively, p=0.005). Healthy controls had the sum of total CT significantly thicker as compared with RA (p<=0.001). Importantly, CT was well correlated with JSN (r=-0.696, p<0.001). Although CT was not correlated with age, disease duration, DAS28-CRP, functional disability score, positivity of rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP-antibody, CT was reduced in RA patients with elevated serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) values compared with those with normal MMP-3 (3.9 versus 5.0, p=0.015).

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation induced lung fibrosis (RILF) is a major complication after lung irradiation and is very important for long term quality of life and could result in fatal respiratory insufficiency. However, there has been little information on dosimetric parameters for radiotherapy planning in the aspect of RILF. The features of RILF related with dosimetric parameters were evaluated., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-eight patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma who underwent post-operative radiation therapy (PORT) without adjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed. The degree of lung fibrosis was estimated by fibrosis volume and the dosimetric parameters were calculated from the plan of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy., RESULTS: The fibrosis volume and V-dose as dosimetric parameters showed significant correlation and the correlation coefficient ranged from 0.602 to 0.683 (P<0.01). The degree of the correlation line was steeper as the dose increase and threshold dose was not found. Mean lung dose (MLD) showed strong correlation with fibrosis volume (correlation coefficient = 0.726, P<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The fibrosis volume is continuously increased with V-dose as the reference dose increases.

Several groups of hairless mice were given UV radiation with and without pretreatment with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), 5% benzoyl peroxide in a gel (Panoxyl), and gel alone, in various combinations, with appropriate control groups included, in order to see whether benzoyl peroxide, which is known to enhance chemical skin carcinogenesis after a single, small dose of DMBA, also enhances UV carcinogenesis. The mice were observed for skin tumors, and all skin lesions were histologically investigated. The percentage of tumor-bearing animals with time is called the tumor rate, the total number of tumors occurring is called the tumor yield. Continual treatment with 5% benzoyl peroxide in gel twice a week, with or without a short pretreatment period of UV radiation resulted in only 2 skin carcinomas, which is remarkable, but not significant. Both Panoxyl and gel alone enhanced tumorigenicity significantly in animals pretreated with a single dose of 51.2 micrograms DMBA. There was no difference between the enhancement caused by Panoxyl and the gel as regards the tumor rate, but when measured as final tumor yield, Panoxyl was slightly more tumor-enhancing than gel alone. However, both Panoxyl and gel protected significantly against UV tumorigenesis (all tumors). There was no difference between the protective effect of the 2 types of treatment. Neither Panoxyl nor gel alone influenced significantly UV skin carcinogenesis (malignant tumors). It is concluded that under these experimental conditions both Panoxyl and gel alone tend to protect against the tumorigenicity and do not enhance the carcinogenicity of UV radiation in hairless mice, whereas both gel and Panoxyl enhance chemical carcinogenesis.

Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) has been an important component of treatment for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), but delayed neurotoxicity has been a matter of concern. We have employed partial-brain radiotherapy (PBRT) with wide margins for PCNSL patients with a single lesion or a few lesions. In this study, we evaluated the treatment outcome in PCNSL patients undergoing PBRT. Between 2003 and 2014, 24 patients were treated with PBRT; 16 received high-dose-methotrexate (MTX) -containing chemotherapy before PBRT. Conventional fractionation with a median dose of 54 Gy was used. For reference, 15 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and WBRT were also analyzed. The 3-year overall survival rate was 60% for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT and 68% for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy plus PBRT. The 3-year progression-free survival rate was 41% for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT and 36% for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy. The in-field recurrence rate was 26% and the out-of-field recurrence rate was 15% at 3 years for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT. The rates for in-field recurrence and the out-of-field recurrence were 27% and 21%, respectively, for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy. CNS-recurrence rates were similar in patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and PBRT to the rates in those undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and WBRT. Neurocognitive dysfunction developed in 3 of the 16 patients undergoing MTX + PBRT and in 4 of 15 patients undergoing MTX + WBRT (P = 0.68). PBRT seems to be a feasible treatment option for solitary PCNSL. Further investigations are warranted to evaluate the advantages of PBRT over WBRT. Copyright © The Author 2015.

3089,"Functional Preservation after Planned Partial Resection Followed by Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Large Vestibular Schwannomas. Objective The treatment goal for vestibular schwannomas (VS) has been changed from total removal of the tumor to functional preservation with long-term tumor growth control. The small- to medium-sized VS can be treated by stereotactic radiosurgery, but large VS require surgical decompression for the relief of cerebellar dysfunction and increased intracranial pressure. We have been performing planned partial surgical resections followed by gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for large VS. Here, we evaluate a recent series of such cases from the standpoint of functional outcomes. Methods From January 2000 to May 2013, we treated 40 patients with large unilateral VS (maximum tumor diameter at least 25 mm) with planned partial tumor removal followed by GKS for functional preservation. The median maximum diameter of the tumors was 32.5 mm (range 25-52 mm). All patients underwent surgery via the retrosigmoid approach, and tumors situated on the ventral and in the internal auditory canal intentionally were not removed, thus preserving cranial nerve functions. GKS was performed 1-12 months after surgical resection (median interval 3 months). The median tumor volume at GKS was 3.3 cm3 (range 0.4-10.4 cm3) and the median prescribed dose was 12 Gy (range 10-12 Gy). The median follow-up period after GKS was 65 months (18-156 months). Results At the final follow-up, facial nerve preservation (House-Brackmann grade I-II) was achieved in 38 patients (95%; House-Brackmann grade I: 92.5%, II: 2.5%). Among the 14 patients with preoperative pure tone average (PTA) less than 50 dB, 6 of them (42.9%) maintained PTA less than 50 dB at the last follow-up. Two patients improved from severe hearing loss to PTA less than 50 dB (1 patient after surgery and 1 patient one and half years after GKS). Five- and 10-year tumor growth control occurred in 86% of patients. Four patients (10%) required salvage surgery; the predictive factor was tumor volume greater than 6 cm3 at GKS (P = 0.01). Conclusions Planned partial removal of large VS followed by GKS achieved a high rate of facial nerve and hearing preservation. To achieve long-term tumor growth control, the tumor volume at GKS after planned partial surgical resection should be smaller than 6 cm3. Our results revealed that patients with hearing preservation postoperatively have a chance of maintaining hearing function, even though the possibility exists of deterioration by long-term follow-up after surgical intervention and GKS. Furthermore, some patients with severe hearing loss before treatment have the chance of hearing improvement, even those with large VS.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.05887192
3090,"Functional Outcomes of Salvage Surgery for Vestibular Schwannomas after Failed Gamma Knife Radiosurgery. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed our experience with salvage surgery following failed gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for vestibular schwannomas., METHODS: The study comprised 18 patients with unilateral vestibular schwannomas. The median prescribed radiation dose was 12 Gy (range, 10-12.5 Gy). Nine patients had regrowth after GKS, and 9 had regrowth after surgical resection plus GKS. The median interval between GKS and surgical resection was 26 months (range: 4-66 months). The maximum tumor diameter of all patients ranged 25-43 mm (median 35.5 mm). The tumor was removed subtotally in 2 patients and partially in the other 16 patients. The median follow-up period after surgical resection was 60 months (range: 12-144 months)., RESULTS: Among the 17 patients with preoperative preserved facial nerve function (House-Brackmann [HB] grade I-III), 14 of them (82%) had an HB score of grade I at the last follow-up. There were no differences in facial nerve preservation between those with failed GKS and those with failed GKS plus surgery (78% vs. 100%, P = 0.156). At the post-salvage surgery follow-up, the residual tumor was unchanged or decreased in 15 patients (83%) and increased in 3 patients (17%)., CONCLUSION: A surgical indication after GKS should be carefully considered because of the natural regression of transient tumor expansion with time, and surgical resection is limited to subtotal or partial removal for functional preservation. Careful follow-up is necessary in patients with tumor regrowth several years after GKS due to delayed radiation effects. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.0408624

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy (PMCT) has recently been introduced as a new treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Japan. This study was performed to evaluate its efficacy and safety., METHODOLOGY: Thirteen patients with 17 nodules of unresectable HCC were subjected to PMCT under ultrasonic guidance. The tumors ranged from 1.2-4.4 cm in size. Assessment of the efficacy of PMCT was made by follow-up with dynamic computed tomography (CT)., RESULTS: In the patients with small HCC ( or = 2.1 cm), 5 out of 7 nodules developed local recurrence after PMCT. Regarding assessment of the necrotic area after PMCT, dynamic CT revealed enhancement that was possibly caused by congestion of the liver parenchyma surrounding the area of necrosis due to PMCT in the early phase of the treatment. Therefore, the necrotic area must be assessed carefully. Although a slight heat sensation and/or pain during microwave irradiation (a common effect of PMCT) occurred in all patients, there were no serious adverse effects., CONCLUSIONS: Complete remission of small HCC ( or = 2.1 cm). There were no serious adverse effects from PMCT and the therapy can be safely carried out even in patients with poor liver function.",Excluded,0.039159555

Background: Arm transplantation (ATx) is a novelty in the field of upper-limb transplantation, with only 7 procedures performed world-wide. Case Report: In this paper we report on early results of unilateral arm transplantation recipients. Patient 1, a 30-year-old man, examined 30 months post-transplant, is able to actively flex the elbow, has 160 degree of ROM in the fingers of the grafted limb, and scored 92 points in the DASH questionnaire and 62 points in the Comprehensive Functional Score System (CFSS). The post-transplant period was complicated with 1 acute rejection episode due to CMV infection, and delayed bony union. Patient 2, a 55-year-old woman, examined 19 months post-transplant, is able to actively flex the elbow, has 180 degree of ROM in the fingers of the grafted limb, and scored 89 points in the DASH questionnaire and 64 points in the Comprehensive Functional Score System (CFSS). Conclusion(s): The post-transplant period was complicated with a delayed bony union. The ATx seems to be a valuable reconstructive therapeutic modality. © Ann Transplant.",Excluded,0.03849248
3094,"Standard-, Reduced-, and No-Dose Thin-Section Radiologic Examinations: Comparison of Capability for Nodule Detection and Nodule Type Assessment in Patients Suspected of Having Pulmonary Nodules. Purpose To compare the capability of pulmonary thin-section magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with ultrashort echo time (UTE) with that of standard- and reduced-dose thin-section computed tomography (CT) in nodule detection and evaluation of nodule type. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Standard- and reduced-dose chest CT (60 and 250 mA) and MR imaging with UTE were used to examine 52 patients; 29 were men (mean age, 66.4 years +/- 7.3 [standard deviation]; age range, 48-79 years) and 23 were women (mean age, 64.8 years +/- 10.1; age range, 42-83 years). Probability of nodule presence was assessed for all methods with a five-point visual scoring system. All nodules were then classified as missed, ground-glass, part-solid, or solid nodules. To compare nodule detection capability of the three methods, consensus for performances was rated by using jackknife free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis, and kappa analysis was used to compare intermethod agreement for nodule type classification. Results There was no significant difference (F = 0.70, P = .59) in figure of merit between methods (standard-dose CT, 0.86; reduced-dose CT, 0.84; MR imaging with UTE, 0.86). There was no significant difference in sensitivity between methods (standard-dose CT vs reduced-dose CT, P = .50; standard-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, P = .50; reduced-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, P >.99). Intermethod agreement was excellent (standard-dose CT vs reduced-dose CT, kappa = 0.98, P < .001; standard-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, kappa = 0.98, P < .001; reduced-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, kappa = 0.99, P < .001). Conclusion Pulmonary thin-section MR imaging with UTE was useful in nodule detection and evaluation of nodule type, and it is considered at least as efficacious as standard- or reduced-dose thin-section CT. © RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",Excluded,0.038580958
3095,"Can we achieve a radionuclide radiation dose equal to or less than that of 99mTc-hydroxymethane diphosphonate bone scintigraphy with a low-dose 18F-sodium fluoride time-of-flight PET of diagnostic quality?. PURPOSE: F-Sodium fluoride is a bone tracer with a high signal-to-noise ratio, but its dosimetry is higher than that of Tc-labeled phosphonates at the recommended activities. The study's purpose was to determine whether the reduction by half of F-sodium fluoride-injected activity, mimicked by a short-timed reconstruction image, simulating a total dose less than or equal to that of Tc-hydroxymethane diphosphonate scintigraphy, had an impact on the accuracy of PET semiquantitative measurements and image quality. METHOD(S): Whole-body time-of-flight F-sodium fluoride PET/computed tomography (CT) images were acquired prospectively from 40 adult patients for detection of bone metastases. F-Sodium fluoride was administered according to the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) and Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM) practice guidelines. From the acquired 1 min/bed position list-mode data, 30-s reconstructions were extracted. Measurements of maximum standard uptake value were recorded with a region of interest applied to the same location on the 1-min and 30-s images, which were displayed side by side, and were analyzed using Bland-Altman plots. A masked reading was performed by two senior nuclear medicine physicians who counted the foci of visually increased uptake. RESULT(S): Bland-Altman plots showed an excellent agreement between the maximum standard uptake value measurements of the 60- and 30-s images. The paired Wilcoxon test results between the corresponding 60- and 30-s images read by masked readers A and B were not significant (P=0.15 and 0.19, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Reducing acquisition duration by half or injecting half of the activity recommended by the EANM and SNM practice guidelines can lead to F-sodium fluoride time-of-flight PET images of diagnostic quality, achieving a radiation dose less than or equal to that of Tc-labeled phosphonates.

3096,"Standard dose and dose-escalated radiation therapy are associated with favorable survival in select elderly patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. We hypothesized elderly patients with good Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) treated with standard dose or dose-escalated radiation therapy (SDRT/DERT) and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) would have favorable overall survival (OS) compared to historical elderly patients treated with hypofractionated RT (HFRT). From 2004 to 2015, 66 patients age >= 60 with newly diagnosed, pathologically proven glioblastoma were treated with SDRT/DERT over 30 fractions with concurrent/adjuvant TMZ at a single institution. Kaplan-Meier methods and the log-rank test were used to assess OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate analysis (MVA) was performed using Cox Proportional-Hazards. Median follow-up was 12.6 months. Doses ranged from 60 to 81 Gy (median 66). Median KPS was 90 (range 60-100) and median age was 67 years (range 60-81), with 29 patients >= 70 years old. 32% underwent gross total resection (GTR). MGMT status was known in 28%, 42% of whom were methylated. Median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI 6.9-11.0) and OS was 12.7 months (95% CI 9.7-14.1). Patients age >= 70 with KPS >= 90 had a median OS of 12.4 months. Median OS was 27.1 months for MGMT methylated patients. On MVA controlling for age, dose, KPS, MGMT, GTR, and adjuvant TMZ, younger age (HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.8-0.9, p < 0.01), MGMT methylation (HR:0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.7, p = 0.01), and GTR (HR:0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9, p = 0.01) were associated with improved OS.

The ability of unmanipulated, antilymphocyte serum (ALS)-treated, and X-irradiated nude BALB/c female mice (in their 13th backcross generation) to serve as hosts for 10 human lymphoblastoid cell lines as well as for peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy humans was compared. The 10 lymphoma lines included 7 previously characterized and reported in the literature. Significant differences with respect to both latency period for tumor appearance and success rate for tumor transplantation were detected among the 3 experimental groups. The unmanipulated mice were poor recipients for lymphoma heterotranplants, and tumors were produced in only two instances. In contrast, 6 tumor lines were successfully transplanted in mice inoculated with ALS, and all 10 lines were successfully transplanted in X-irradiated recipients. Although tumors were readily produced in ALS-treated and X-irradiated mice, no gross or histologic evidence of focal or distant metastases was apparent. Human lymphoblastoid cells were recultured, essentially unchanged, from the heterotransplants from 6 of 7 tumors tested. Although the tumor line HT 1460, originally from a human lymphoma, was successfully transplanted in all 3 groups, only mouse cells were recultured. The use of X-irradiation, rather than ALS, to immunosuppress nude mice offers a more standardized method for heterotransplanting human tumor cell lines and permits ready comparisons between laboratories. Furthermore X-radiation permits transplantation and subsequent study of lymphoblastoid tumors that are otherwise difficult to successfully transplant in nude mice.",Included,0.70765495
3098,"Genomic characterization of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in radiation-exposed Chornobyl cleanup workers. Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was the predominant leukemia in a recent study of Chornobyl cleanup workers from Ukraine exposed to radiation (UR-CLL). Radiation risks of CLL significantly increased with increasing bone marrow radiation doses. Current analysis aimed to clarify whether the increased risks were due to radiation or to genetic mutations in the Ukrainian population. Method(s): A detailed characterization of the genomic landscape was performed in a unique sample of 16 UR-CLL patients and age- and sex-matched unexposed general population Ukrainian-CLL (UN-CLL) and Western-CLL (W-CLL) patients (n = 28 and 100, respectively). Result(s): Mutations in telomere-maintenance pathway genes POT1 and ATM were more frequent in UR-CLL compared to UN-CLL and W-CLL (both p < 0.05). No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at del13q14, del11q, del17p or trisomy12 was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. Type of work performed in the Chornobyl zone, age at exposure and at diagnosis, calendar time, and Rai stage were significant predictors of total genetic lesions (all p < 0.05). Tumor telomere length was significantly longer in UR-CLL than in UN-CLL (p = 0.009) and was associated with the POT1 mutation and survival. Conclusion(s): No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at CLL-associated genes was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. The novel associations between radiation exposure, telomere maintenance and CLL prognosis identified in this unique case series provide suggestive, though limited data and merit further investigation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded,0.9706852
3099,"Safety and efficacy of a novel high-intensity focused electromagnetic technology device for noninvasive abdominal body shaping. BACKGROUND: Thermal fat reduction technologies are leading the market for nonsurgical abdominal contouring. However, they are ideal principally for patients with fat bulges., OBJECTIVES: Our study investigates the effects of a novel nonthermal technology affecting the abdominal musculature and subcutaneous adipose tissue., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 22 patients (avg. BMI 23.8 kg m-2 ) underwent 4 treatments on abdomen with high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) field device. Treatments took 30 minutes and were spaced apart by 2-3 days. Photographs, weight, and waist measurements were taken at the baseline, after the last treatment, and at month 3 follow-up. Patient satisfaction was noted. Photographs were evaluated by blinded evaluators., RESULTS: The study protocol was completed by 19 patients. At month 3, the average waist size reduction was 4.37 +/- 2.63 cm (P < 0.01). The evaluators identified the before image from the 3-month image 89.47% of the time. About 91% of patients reported their abdominal appearance improved, and 92% stated they are satisfied with treatment results at month 3. No adverse events occurred., CONCLUSION: Observed waist size reduction and aesthetic improvement appear to be a combination of fat reduction and increased muscle definition of abdominal wall. In lower BMI patients, the increased abdominal muscle definition was largely responsible for the improvement. This novel energy device provides an additional tool for body contouring with primary application for lower and medium BMI patients.

3100,"Interventional cardiologists and risk of radiation-induced cataract: results of a French multicenter observational study. BACKGROUND: Interventional cardiologists (ICs) are exposed to X-rays and may be at risk to develop cataract earlier than common senile cataract. Excess risk of posterior subcapsular cataract, known as radiation-induced, was previously observed in samples of ICs from Malaysia, and Latin America. The O'CLOC study (Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology) was performed to quantify the risk at the scale of France., METHODS: This cross-sectional multicenter study included an exposed group of ICs from different French centers and an unexposed control group of non-medical workers. Individual information was collected about cataract risk factors and past and present workload in catheterization laboratory. All participants had a clinical eye examination to classify the lens opacities (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapsular) with the international standard classification LOCS III., RESULTS: The study included 106 ICs (mean age = 51 +/- 7 years) and 99 unexposed control subjects (mean age = 50 +/- 7 years). The groups did not differ significantly in the prevalence of either nuclear or cortical lens opacities (61% vs. 69% and 23% vs. 29%, respectively). However, posterior subcapsular lens opacities, were significantly more frequent among ICs (17% vs. 5%, p=0.006), for an OR=3.9 [1.3-11.4]. The risk increased with duration of activity but no clear relationship with workload was observed. However, the risk appeared lower for regular users of protective lead glasses (OR=2.2 [0.4-12.8])., CONCLUSIONS: ICs, in France as elsewhere, are at high risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts. Use of protective equipment against X-rays, in particular lead glasses, is strongly recommended to limit this risk. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included,0.9707554
3101,"Effectiveness of gene expression profiling for response prediction of rectal cancer to preoperative radiotherapy. Background: Our aim was to determine whether the expression levels of specific genes could predict clinical radiosensitivity in human colorectal cancer. Method(s): Radioresistant colorectal cancer cell lines were established by repeated X-ray exposure (total, 100 Gy), and the gene expressions of the parent and radioresistant cell lines were compared in a microarray analysis. To verify the microarray data, we carried out a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of identified genes in clinical samples from 30 irradiated rectal cancer patients. Result(s): A comparison of the intensity data for the parent and three radioresistant cell lines revealed 17 upregulated and 142 downregulated genes in all radioresistant cell lines. Next, we focused on two upregulated genes, PTMA (prothymosin alpha) and EIF5a2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A), in the radioresistant cell lines. In clinical samples, the expression of PTMA was significantly higher in the minor effect group than in the major effect group (P = 0.004), but there were no significant differences in EIF5a2 expression between the two groups. Conclusion(s): We identified radiation-related genes in colorectal cancer and demonstrated that PTMA may play an important role in radiosensitivity. Our findings suggest that PTMA may be a novel marker for predicting the effectiveness of radiotherapy in clinical cases. © Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2007.",Excluded,0.97072875
3102,"Eye lens radiation exposure to interventional cardiologists: A retrospective assessment of cumulative doses. Radiation dose to the eye lens is a crucial issue for interventional cardiologists (ICs) who are exposed during the procedures they perform. This paper presents a retrospective assessment of the cumulative eye lens doses of ICs enrolled in the O'CLOC study for Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology. Information on the workload in the catheterisation laboratory, radiation protection equipment, eye lens dose per procedure and dose reduction factors associated with eye-protective equipment were considered. For the 129 ICs at an average age of 51 who had worked for an average period of 22 years, the estimated cumulative eye lens dose ranged from 25 mSv to more than 1600 mSv; the mean+SD was 423+359 mSv. After several years of practice, without eye protection, ICs may exceed the new ICRP lifetime eye dose threshold of 500 mSv and be at high risk of developing early radiation-induced cataracts. Radiation protection equipment can reduce these doses and should be used routinely. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.2266999

Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) involving a major branch of the portal or hepatic vein is in a locally advanced stage and remains difficult to cure. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) in locally advanced HCC (LAHCC). Method(s): The data of 11 consecutive patients with LAHCC who received C-ion RT were analyzed. The C-ion RT doses of 52.8 Gy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) and 60.0 Gy (RBE) were delivered in 4 fractions for standard cases, and the 60.0 Gy dose was delivered in 12 fractions for close-to-gastrointestinal-tract cases. Survival and local control probabilities were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-up duration after C-ion RT was 36.4 months. The median age at the time of registration for C-ion RT was 76 years. The median tumor size was 53 mm. The numbers of treatment-naive and recurrent HCC patients were 1 and 10, respectively. Direct invasion of the major branch of the portal vein, hepatic vein, or both portal and hepatic veins was observed in three, five, and three patients, respectively. The 3-year overall survival, local control, and progression-free survival rates were 64, 78, and 18%, respectively. No patient developed radiation-induced liver diseases or grade 3 or higher toxicities in the acute and late phases. Conclusion(s): C-ion RT showed favorable clinical outcomes with a high rate of local control and minimal toxicities in LAHCC.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether exposure to a pulsed high-frequency electromagnetic field (pulsed EMF) emitted by a mobile phone has short-term effects on the inhibitory control of saccades., METHODS: A double-blind, counterbalanced crossover study design was employed. We assessed the performance of 10 normal subjects on antisaccade (AS) and cued saccade (CUED) tasks as well as two types of overlap saccade (OL1, OL2) task before and after 30 min of exposure to EMF emitted by a mobile phone or sham exposure., RESULTS: After EMF or sham exposure, we observed a slight but significant shortening of latency in the CUED and OL2 tasks. AS amplitude decreased as well as the saccade velocities in the AS, CUED, and OL1 tasks after exposure. These changes occurred regardless of whether exposure was real or sham. The frequencies of pro-saccades in the AS task, saccades to cue in the CUED task, and prematurely initiated saccades in the overlap (OL2) task did not change significantly after real or sham EMF exposure., CONCLUSIONS: Thirty minutes of mobile phone exposure has no significant short-term effect on the inhibitory control of saccades., SIGNIFICANCE: The cortical processing responsible for saccade inhibition is not affected by exposure to EMF emitted by a mobile phone.

The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent changes in speech after C-IMRT treatment are related to mean doses to the tongue and velopharynx (VP). In 34 patients with advanced hypopharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, or oropharyngeal cancer, changes in speech from pretreatment to 10 weeks and 1 year posttreatment were correlated with mean doses to the base of tongue (BOT), oral cavity (OC) and tonsillar fossa/soft palate (VP). Differences in anteroposterior tongue position, dorsoventral degree of tongue to palate or pharynx constriction, grooving, strength, nasality, and laryngeal rise, were assessed by acoustic changes in three speech sounds that depend on a (post-) alveolar closure or narrowing (/t/, /s/, /z/), three with a tongue to palate/pharyngeal narrowing (/l/, /r/, /u/), and in vowel /a/ at comfortable and highest pitch. Acoustically assessed changes in tongue positioning, shape, velopharyngeal constriction, and laryngeal elevation were significantly related to mean doses to the tongue and velopharynx. The mean dose to BOT predicted changes in anteroposterior tongue positioning from pre- to 10-weeks posttreatment. From pretreatment to 1-year, mean doses to BOT, OC, and VP were related to changes in grooving, strength, laryngeal height, nasality, palatalization, and degree of pharyngeal constriction.

For many hematological malignancies, high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation offers the best and sometimes the only chance for cure. However, the main causes of failure of this therapy are relapse and toxicity. In order to selectively deliver higher doses of radiotherapy to the bone marrow and to spare normal organs, we explored 52Fe therapy before a conventional BMT conditioning regimen. Twenty-four patients at high risk for relapse after BMT were included in a phase II study. The median follow-up was 42 months. The median 52Fe dose was 59 mCi. This resulted in a median radiation-absorbed dose (RAD) to the BM of 626 rad. The median RAD to the liver was 338 rad. No untoward effects were noted after the injections of 52Fe.

Background and Purpose: In percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), placement of the access tract into the kidney is an important aspect of the procedure and is responsible for the steep learning curve associated with the operation. The aim of the current prospective randomized trial was to assess the duration of radiation exposure along with the safety and efficacy of PCNL done by a trainee, utilizing either ultrasonography (US) or fluoroscopic guidance to obtain access., Patients and Methods: Sixty-four patients with <=3cm renal calculi undergoing single-tract PCNL by trainee urologists (experience of <25 PCNL's) were randomized into US-and fluoroscopic-guided access groups (32 in each). In Group 1 (US guided), puncture was done using a 3.5/5MHz US probe with a puncture attachment, whereas the triangulation technique with biplanar C-arm fluoroscopy was utilized in group 2 (fluoroscopic guided). Patient demographics, stone parameters, intraoperative characteristics, fluoroscopy durations, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed., Results: Both groups were comparable as far as patient and stone characteristics were concerned. The fluoroscopy exposure during the puncture phase (T2) and overall (T) was significantly lower in the US group at 9.0+/-20.8 vs 43.8+/-34.8, (p<0.0001) and 204.3+/-84 vs 239.9+/-77.5, (p=0.04). Six patients in group1 required fluoroscopic adjustment (p=0.03). All other intra-and postoperative parameters were similar in both the groups. Conclusion(s): Both ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance for renal access are equally safe and feasible in the hands of a trainee urologist. Total fluoroscopy duration and exposure time during puncture were both significantly less in the ultrasound group. Expertise in fluoroscopic-guided access is essential for a novice to effectively achieve access in all possible situations.Copyright © 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded,0.03837203

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether novel markers not involving ionizing radiation could predict coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression in a low-risk population., BACKGROUND: Increase in CAC scores over time (CAC progression) improves prediction of coronary heart disease (CHD) events. Due to radiation exposure, CAC measurement represents an undesirable method for repeated risk assessment, particularly in individuals with low predicted risk (Framingham Risk Score [FRS] <10%)., METHODS: From 6,814 participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), 2,620 individuals were classified as low risk for CHD events (FRS <10%) and had follow-up CAC measurement. In addition to traditional risk factors (RFs), various combinations of novel marker models were selected on the basis of data-driven, clinical, or backward stepwise selection techniques., RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 2.5 years. CAC progression occurred in 574 participants (22% overall; 214 of 1,830 with baseline CAC = 0 and 360 of 790 with baseline CAC >0). Addition of various combinations of novel markers to the base model (c statistic = 0.711) revealed improvements in discrimination of approximately only 0.005 each (c statistics 0.7158, 0.7160, and 0.7164) for the best-fit models. All 3 best-fit novel marker models calibrated well but were similar to the base model in predicting individual risk probabilities for CAC progression. The highest prevalence of CAC progression occurred in the highest compared with the lowest probability quartile groups (39.2% to 40.3% vs. 6.4% to 7.1%)., CONCLUSIONS: In individuals at low predicted risk according to FRS, traditional risk factors predicted CAC progression in the short term with good discrimination and calibration. Prediction improved minimally when various novel markers were added to the model. Copyright A© 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Introduction The present study attempted to establish local Computed Tomography DRL by collecting radiation doses of the three most frequently performed CT examinations at our institute. The present study focuses on the local DRLs which are based on clinical indications as the main determinants of patient radiation dose in correlation with acceptable image quality within facility. Method The present study included a total 125 patient imaged on Helical MDCT Ingenuity (Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, USA) 42 detector rows 128 slice. The CT examinations performed were for CT head for acute stroke, routine chest CT and routine abdomen CT examinations. A set of common data was collected for each CT examinations such as patient ID, age, weight, beam width, rotational time, image quality score (IQS). The CT dose parameters displayed CTDIvol and DLP were also measured for scout image and diagnostic CT respectively during each single phase CT examination. The median value was calculated for individual clinical CT examination based on standard of adequate image quality. Results The patients underwent CT in this study were in the range of 25 to 70 years of age with mean +/- SD age (49.8 +/- 15.3). The medium DLP calculated was 1195.8 mGy.cm, 333.2 mGy.cm and 512.9 mGy.cm for acute stroke head, routine chest and routine abdomen CT examination respectively for IQS of 3. The scout image median DLP calculated was 4.2 mGy.cm, 3.8 mGy.cm and 3.7 mGy.cm for acute stroke head, routine chest and routine abdomen CT examination respectively for IQS of 3.

3115,"Post-transplant pulmonary function abnormalities nadir at five years and then fully normalize by the second decade in allogeneic stem cell transplantation survivors. Late onset non-infectious pulmonary injury complicates >10% of allogeneic stem cell transplants (SCT), particularly in subjects conditioned with high dose Total Body Irradiation (TBI), and contributes to transplant related mortality. To characterize the kinetics of recovery from pulmonary injury in long term survivors we collected data on 138 (78 male, 60 female) subjects surviving >5 years after SCT from their HLAmatched siblings. The median age at transplant was 36 years. Transplant indications were CML (63), AML (31), MDS (19), ALL (12) and others (14). 126 subjects received mu1200 cGy TBI-based conditioning with or without lung shielding, 3 received 400 cGy TBI-based conditioning and 9 patients received no irradiation. Ex vivo T cell depleted grafts were given to 131 recipients, except for six who received a nonmyeloablative SCT. Of the 138 long term survivors, 26 had no cGvHD, 70 had cGvHD lasting less than 3 years; and 42 had prolonged cGvHD requiring systemic immunosuppression for > 3 years. Among the 17 patients who died after 5 years, 4 died of pulmonary causes, including two with lung cancer. Pre-transplant abnormalities (< 80% predicted) in PFTs were found in 15.9% of subjects in the following declining frequency: FVC%, VC, TLC, FEV1, DLCO Adj (adjusted for hemoglobin and alveolar ventilation) Hb/VA and FEV1/FVC. Baseline (BL) PFTs served as the reference for all subsequent measurements at 3, 5, 10 and 15 years for each survivor. The only parameter showing a clinically significant decline post transplant was DLCO Adj which reached a nadir at 5 years, with subsequent normalization at the 10 year mark [paired ttest]. An abnormal (<80% of baseline) DLCO Adj was found in 19.6, 21.0, 0.7 and 0% of survivors at 3, 5, 10 and 15 years. The mean DLCO Adj at 3, 5, 10 and 15 years were 91% (P = .003), 88% (P < .001), 98% (p=NS) and 100% (p=NS) of BL, respectively. Multivariable modeling (forward-stepwise multiple regression) identified the presence of chronic GVHD (P = .017) and abnormal Baseline DLCO Adj (P = .023) as the only significant factors associated with the decline in DLCO Adj at 5 years but excluded smoking, conditioning intensity, baseline C-reactive protein level, TBI dose to the lungs and demographic variables. In conclusion, DLCO Adj is the only PFT marker associated with pulmonary injury in our TBI-conditioned transplant population. DLCO Adj nadirs at 5 years post-SCT, and normalizes by 10 years. Chronic GVHD and pre-transplant DLCO Adj are important contributory factors to the decline in DLCO Adj. (Figure presented).",Excluded,0.043409638
3116,"Clinical and radiological manifestations of pleural effusion at the UMAE No. 34, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. Introduction: Many benign and malignant diseases can cause pleural effusion. Symptoms depend on the amount of accumulated fluid and the underlying cause. Imaging studies are useful in the detection and management of pleural effusions. Objective(s): To determine the radiological characteristics of pleural effusion and its relationship with clinical and biochemical manifestations and histological markers. Method(s): From March 2011 to March 2012, an observational, descriptive, prolective analytical study was performed. Chest X-rays of 138 patients > 15 years of age with pleural effusion during the study period were reviewed. Radiological studies were interpreted by three pulmonologists blinded to the underlying pathology (kappa. 95). We used the statistical package SPSS 19.0. Statistical significance was considered when p value was < 0.05. Result(s): The mean age of the study group was 56.1 +/- 15.8 years; 93 (67.4%) were males. The most common signs and symptoms regardless of the etiology were dyspnea, 108 cases (78.2%) (p = 0.033); cough, 96 (69.5%); weight loss, 82 (59.4%) (p = 0.042); and pain, 79 (57.2%). The most common X-ray pattern was massive effusion in 46 (33%) followed by loculated effusion in 33 (24%). There was a unilateral predominance in 119 (86%) patients, with greater frequency in those with infectious (p = 0.012) and neoplastic etiology (p = 0.006). Conclusion(s): Clinical and radiological manifestations of pleural effusion are varied according to the type of pleural pathology and the degree of involvement.Copyright © 2014, Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias.

3117,"A retrospective review of the appropriateness of d-dimerordering and interpretation using wells' clinical probability criteria. Introduction The D-dimer has been validated in diagnostic venous thromboembolism (VTE) algorithms. The highsensitivity of the assay allows for safe exclusion of VTE in patients with low clinical pre-testprobability and a negative D-dimer. The Wells score for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and PulmonaryEmbolism (PE) are validated pre-test probability tools which help guide physicians on when to ordera D-dimer in patients with suspected VTE. However, we suspect these scoring tools are often under-utilized by physicians leading toinappropriate D-dimer ordering and subsequent interventions. We sought to explore the landscape ofD-dimer ordering at our institution. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of 482 patients in whom a D-dimer had been orderedover a 3-month period at the University of Alberta Hospital, a tertiary care teaching hospital inEdmonton, Canada. Charts were reviewed for patient demographics, specialty of ordering physician,apparent indication for ordering, patient risk factors for VTE and evidence of a pre-test probability(PTP) calculation. WIf no PTP score was documented, we retrospectively calculated Wells DVT or PE scores. VTE wasdeemed likely with a calculated Wells score for DVT 2 or Wells score for PE >4. In the case of highPTP for PE, patients should go directly to imaging and a D-dimer should not be performed. A cut offof >= 0.50 mg/L was deemed a positive D-dimer (STA-LIATEST). We also reviewed subsequentinvestigations thought to be influenced by interpretation of the D-dimer including:ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) and pulmonary angiography (CTPA) scans, and upper and lowerextremity doppler ultrasound studies. We then used multivariable logistic regression analysis toevaluate the proportion of patients who received imaging despite a low PTP and negative D-dimer. Results Seventy eight percent of D-dimers were ordered by Emergency physicians while 15.3% were drawnon admitted patients, and 5.8% in the outpatient setting. The indication for ordering was unknown in87 (17.5%) of cases. Pre-test probability scores were documented in only 8 (1.6%) of cases. All ofthose documented were the Wells PE score. When Wells DVT and PE scores were calculatedretrospectively, 30.0% and 17.1% (87 cases) were deemed 'likely' for VTE, respectively. However,imaging was performed in 172 cases (34.6%), including in 36 cases despite a negative D-dimer resultand low PTP. In contrast, 68 cases (17.2%) had a D-dimer performed with a high Wells PTP for PE despite therecommendation to proceed directly to imaging. VTE (either DVT or PE) was confirmed by imagingin 32 (18.6%) of cases, the majority (53.1%) had a high retrospective PTP. Conclusions Inappropriate ordering and interpretation of D-dimers remains a significant problem despite theimplementation of clinical guidelines and pre-test probability algorithms, namely the Wells score forDVT and PE meant to guide physicians. This leads to unnecessary cost, radiation exposure, andprolonged contact with the health care system for patients. This suggests the need for qualityimprovement initiatives which draw physician's attention to pre-test probability tools which cancurbing subsequent inappropriate investigations and improve patient care.",Excluded,0.038383514
3118,"Magnetic resonance imaging-based tumour perfusion parameters are biomarkers predicting response after radiation to brain metastases. PURPOSE: To investigate whether early relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and permeability (Ktrans(2)) measurements may serve as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers of radiation response or progression for brain metastases., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy brain metastases in 44 patients treated with either stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy were imaged with dynamic susceptibility and dynamic contrast enhancement MRI at baseline, 1 week and 1 month after treatment. The final response status was determined according to volume criteria derived from a 1 year post-treatment MRI or last available follow-up MRI. Tumours were characterised as responders, non-responders, progressors and non-progressors and compared for Ktrans(2), rCBF and rCBV differences. Uni- and multivariate analysis evaluated factors associated with tumour response and progression at 1 week and 1 month. A generalised estimating equations (GEE) model accounted for multiple tumours per subject. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis identified optimal cut-off values, sensitivity and specificity for response or progression., RESULTS: Tumour responders showed lower Ktrans(2) and reduced rCBF at 1 week (P < 0.05 each). Progressive disease showed lower rCBF and reduced rCBV at 1 month (P < 0.05 each). GEE and multivariate analysis revealed lower Ktrans(2) at 1 week, an absence of prior radiation predicted response. At 1 month only lower rCBV predicted progressive disease on GEE and multivariate analysis. Optimal cut-off points for Ktrans(2) and rCBV were 1.37 and 2.03 with sensitivity and specificity of 61.5 and 81.1% and 73.9 and 81.8%, respectively., CONCLUSION: Lower Ktrans(2) at 1 week and rCBV at 1 month discriminated responders and progressive disease, respectively.

3119,"86Y-DOTA0)-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (SMT487)--a phase 1 clinical study: pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and renal protective effect of different regimens of amino acid co-infusion. The pharmacokinetics and dosimetry of (86)Y-DOTA(0)- d-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide ((86)Y-SMT487) were evaluated in a phase I positron emission tomography (PET) study of 24 patients with somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumours. The effect of amino acid (AA) co-infusion on renal and tumour uptake was assessed in a cross-over randomised setting. Five regimens were tested: no infusion, 4-h infusion of 120 g mixed AA (26.4 g l-lysine + l-arginine), 4 h l-lysine (50 g), 10 h 240 g mixed AA (52.8 g l-lysine + l-arginine) and 4 h Lys-Arg (25 g each). Comparisons were performed on an intra-patient basis. Infusions of AA started 0.5 h prior to injection of (86)Y-SMT487 and PET scans were obtained at 4, 24 and 48 h p.i. Absorbed doses to tissues were computed using the MIRD3 method. (86)Y-SMT487 displayed rapid plasma clearance and exclusive renal excretion; uptake was noted in kidneys, tumours, spleen and, to a lesser extent, liver. The 4-h mixed AA co-infusion significantly ( P<0.05) reduced (86)Y-SMT487 renal uptake by a mean of 21%. This protective effect was significant on the dosimetry data (3.3+/-1.3 vs 4.4+/-1.0 mGy/MBq; P<0.05) and was further enhanced upon prolonging the infusion to 10 h (2.1+/-0.4 vs 1.7+/-0.2 mGy/MBq; P<0.05). Infusion of Lys-Arg but not of l-lysine was more effective in reducing renal uptake than mixed AA. Infusion of AA did not result in reduced tumour uptake. The amount of (90)Y-SMT487 (maximum allowed dose: MAD) that would result in a 23-Gy cut-off dose to kidneys was calculated for each study: MAD was higher with mixed AA co-infusion by a mean of 46% (10-114%, P<0.05 vs no infusion). In comparison with 4 h mixed AA, the MAD was higher by a mean of 23% (9-37%; P<0.05) with prolonged infusion and by a mean of 16% (2-28%; P<0.05) with Lys-Arg. We conclude that infusion of large amounts of AA reduces renal exposure during peptide-based radiotherapy and allows higher absorbed doses to tumours. The prolongation of the infusion from 4 to 10 h further enhances the protective effect on the kidneys.",Excluded,0.041408457
3120,"Label-free nanoscale optical metrology on myelinated axons in vivo. In the mammalian nervous system, myelin provides electrical insulation for the neural circuit by forming a highly organized, multilayered thin film around the axon fibers. Here, we investigate the spectral reflectance from this subcellular nanostructure and devise a new label-free technique based on a spectroscopic analysis of reflected light, enabling nanoscale imaging of myelinated axons in their natural living state. Using this technique, we demonstrate three-dimensional mapping of the axon diameter and sensing of dynamic changes in the substructure of myelin at nanoscale. We further reveal the prevalence of axon bulging in the brain cortex in vivo after mild compressive trauma. Our novel tool opens new avenues of investigation by creating unprecedented access to the nanostructural dynamics of live myelinated axons in health and disease.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).",Excluded,0.0398105
3121,"Clinical outcomes and toxicity using Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) for advanced cholangiocarcinoma. Background: To report single-institutional clinical outcomes and toxicity with SBRT for cholangiocarcinoma. Method(s): From March 2009 to July 2011, 10 patients with 12 unresectable primary (n = 6) or recurrent (n = 6) cholangiocarcinoma lesions underwent abdominal SBRT. Sites treated included liver (n = 10), abdominal lymph nodes (n = 1), and adrenal gland (n = 1). SBRT was delivered in three (n = 2) or five (n = 10) consecutive daily fractions over one week. The median prescription dose was 55 Gy (range, 45-60). Treatment response was graded by RECIST v.1.1, and toxicities were scored by CTCAE v.4.0. Data was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method to determine rates of local control (LC), freedom from distant progression (FFDM) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): The median follow-up was 14 months (range, 2-26 months). LC, defined as freedom from progression within the SBRT field, was 100%, but four patients treated to intrahepatic sites experienced progression elsewhere in the liver. Estimates for FFDM at 6 and 12 months were 73% and 31%, respectively. Sites of disease relapse included liver (n = 3), liver and lymph nodes (n = 1), liver and lungs (n = 1), lymph nodes (n = 1), and mesentery (n = 1). OS estimates for the cohort at 6 and 12 months were 83% and 73%, respectively. The most common Grade >=2 early toxicities were Grade 2 nausea and vomiting (n = 5) and gastrointestinal pain (n = 2). Late >=2 toxicities included Grade 2 gastrointestinal pain (n = 3), Grade 3 biliary stenosis (n = 1), and Grade 5 liver failure (n = 1). Conclusion(s): SBRT shows promise as an effective local therapy for properly-selected patients with cholangiocarcinoma. Further follow-up is needed to better quantify the risk of late complications associated with SBRT. © 2012 Barney et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded,0.038273152

3123,"A higher radiotherapy dose is associated with more durable palliation and longer survival in patients with metastatic melanoma. BACKGROUND: Oncologists are often reluctant to recommend radiotherapy (RT) to palliate metastatic melanoma due to a perception that this tumor is ""radioresistant."" The Mayo Clinic experience was analyzed to determine the efficacy of palliative RT., METHODS: Eighty-four consecutive patients with 114 lesions that were not metastatic to the central nervous system (CNS) were evaluated for the response of the presenting symptom, the duration of response, and survival after RT. The median dose delivered was 30 grays (Gy) and the median biologic effective dose (BED) was 39.0 Gy(10). Performance status was not uniformly available for all patients., RESULTS: Complete resolution of the presenting symptom occurred in 10 lesions (9%). Of the lesions treated, there was partial improvement in 86 (75%), no change in 12 (11%), and worsening in 6 (5%) lesions. The median survival was 3.8 months and freedom from disease progression (FFP) for individual lesions was 6 months. Patients treated with >30 Gy had significantly longer FFP compared with patients given 30 Gy had a significantly longer survival than those given a lesser dose (median of 2 months vs 8 months; P < .0001). Similarly, patients receiving a BED >39.0 Gy(10) also were found to have longer FFP (P = .03) and survival (median of 2 months vs 8 months; P < .0001) compared with those receiving a BED 30 Gy and a BED >39.0 Gy(10) were found to be associated with longer palliation.",Excluded,0.040162712
3124,"A high lymph node ratio predicts loco-regional recurrence while microscopic N2 predicts survival after radiation therapy in pIIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer. Objective: Post-operative management of pIIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still debated. Our objective was to identify subgroups of patients who could benefit from treatment based on invaded lymph node ratio (LNR). Method(s): From January 2003 to December 2012, 297 pIIIA-N2 NSCLC patients treated with surgery followed by conformational radiation therapy (RT) were retrospectively analysed. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 30 months. A correlation was observed between LNR and overall survival (OS) (R = -0.3, p < 0.0001), local relapse (R = -0.27, p < 0.0001) and extra-capsular spread (ECS) (Cramer's V = 0.49, p < 0.0001). In univariate analysis, OS was significantly lower in patients with LNR higher than 1/3 (median survival 61 +/- 6.5 vs. 28 +/- 3.8 months, p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, favourable prognostic factors for OS were a LNR <1/3 (HR = 0.53, 95 % CI 0.33-0.85, p = 0.009) and microscopic N2 (HR = 0.56, 95 % CI 0.35-0.90, p = 0.01). For local relapse, multivariate analysis identified the following risk factors: female gender (HR = 2.41, CI 1.36-4.27, p = 0.003), microscopic N2 (HR = 0.40, CI 0.2-0.81, p = 0.01) and a LNR of lower than 2/3 (HR = 0.18, CI 0.07-0.48, p = 0.001). Conclusion(s): Our study supports that LNR is likely related to OS and loco-regional recurrence. Furthermore, microscopic N2 seems to be associated with a better prognosis.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded,0.03886782
3125,"Identification of the most important features of knee osteoarthritis structural progressors using machine learning methods. Objectives: The aim was to identify the most important features of structural knee osteoarthritis (OA) progressors and classification using machine learning methods. Method(s): Participants, features and outcomes were from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. Features were from baseline (1107), including articular knee tissues (135) assessed by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). OA progressors were ascertained by four outcomes: cartilage volume loss in medial plateau at 48 and 96 months (Prop_CV_48M, 96M), Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade 2 and medial joint space narrowing (JSN) 1 at 48 months. Six feature selection models were used to identify the common features in each outcome. Six classification methods were applied to measure the accuracy of the selected features in classifying the subjects into progressors and non-progressors. Classification of the best features was done using an automatic machine learning interface and the area under the curve (AUC). To prioritize the top five features, sparse partial least square (sPLS) method was used. Result(s): For the classification of the best common features in each outcome, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) achieved the highest AUC in Prop_CV_96M, KL and JSN (0.80, 0.88, 0.95), and Gradient Boosting Machine for Prop_CV_48M (0.70). sPLS showed the baseline top five features to predict knee OA progressors are the joint space width, mean cartilage thickness of the medial tibial plateau and sub-regions and JSN. Conclusion(s): In this comprehensive study using a large number of features (n = 1107) and MRI outcomes in addition to radiological outcomes, we identified the best features and classification methods for knee OA structural progressors. Data revealed baseline X-ray and MRI-based features could predict early OA knee progressors and that MLP is the best classification method.Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.",Excluded,0.039150424

Our aim was to describe both sun exposure and sun protection behaviour in a series of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and to study their potential association with vitaminD concentration., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross sectional, observational study. The clinical-demographic variables were obtained via clinical interviews and medical history review. The sunlight exposure assessment was carried out using the Sun Exposure Questionnaire and the concentration of 25-hydroxy vitaminD (25OHD) was measured by an electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay. Questionnaires were conducted on quality of life, physical activity, weekly vitaminD intake and sun protection behaviour., RESULTS: 149 patients were included. In 69% of patients, deficient or insufficient 25OHD values were recorded. 67% showed low sun exposure. A modest significant correlation was observed between the total score of the solar exposure questionnaire and the 25OHD concentration in the complete series (r=0.226, P=.006) and in the summer (r=0.274, P=.01). The sun protection behaviour questionnaire score did not influence the 25OHD concentration. In the multivariate analysis, only the presence of clinical activity was associated with low sun exposure (OR=3.23)., DISCUSSION: Sun exposure according to the questionnaire used was low, was associated with the presence of clinical activity and was weakly correlated with serum 25OHD concentration. More studies are needed to explore the use of individual questionnaires for sun exposure and its relationship with vitaminD in patients with IBD. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

3127,"Treatment selection and outcomes in early-stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma: Analysis of the National Cancer Data Base. Purpose: The choice between combined-modality therapy (CMT) and chemotherapy alone for early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) remains controversial. Our objective was to define factors affecting treatment selection and resulting survival outcomes in the United States. Patients and Methods: We identified 20,600 patients treated with CMT or chemotherapy between 2003 and 2011 from the National Cancer Data Base. Factors affecting treatment selection were studied in a mixed-effects logistic model. Survival outcomes were compared using a propensity score analysis to account for indication bias. Result(s): Only 49.5% of patients received CMT, and this proportion steadily declined between 2003 (59.4%) and 2011 (45.2%), particularly in younger patients. Apart from classical prognostic factors (age, stage, tumor location, histology, comorbidities), treatment selection was significantly influenced by sex, black race, distance to facility, and type of insurance. Uninsured patients had the lowest odds of receiving CMT. A significant random effect related to facility-specific treatment preference was also evident. Estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 89.6%, and relative survival (RS) was 94.3%. After adjustment for guarantee-time and indication biases, CMT was associated with better OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.70) and RS (excess HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.54) than chemotherapy alone. This effect was without significant heterogeneity in subset analysis and was not sensitive to unobserved confounding. Conclusion(s): Socioeconomic factors affect selection of curative treatments in HL. Widespread abandonment of CMT beyond circumstances sanctioned by guidelines may affect survival. Further research should focus on developing strategies that minimize toxicity and access disparities without compromising survival.Copyright © 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded,0.038351983

Excessive unprotected radiation to the heart appears to lead to the development of CAD, even in the absence of significant cardiovascular risk factors. The coexistence of such factors may enhance the probability of CAD. The presence of hypercholesterolemia and concomitant or sequential use of chemotherapeutic agents (especially doxorubicin) could further increase this risk. Therapeutic decisions, as with any other manifestation of CAD, relate to the extent of myocardium at jeopardy and to the overall diffuseness of CAD. Management options possible are PTCA or coronary artery bypass surgery. The latter may be required in left main artery stenosis and complicated ostial lesions.

3130,"Horizontal angular VOR, nystagmus dumping, and sensation duration in spacelab SLS-1 crewmembers. In 1G, the apparent time constant (Td) of postrotatory SPV decay with the head tilted face down is 55% of that with head erect (Te). This phenomenon is called ""nystagmus dumping"" and has been attributed to G effects on VOR velocity storage. Similarly, postrotatory sensation duration with head tilted (Dd) is 32% of that when head erect (De). In parabolic flight, Te and De are 70% of 1-G values, but a pitch back dumping movement produces no further change. Te, Td, and Dd have not previously been measured in orbital flight. VOR and sensation duration was tested in 4 crewmembers in 4 preflight, 1 inflight (days 4 or 5) and 4 post flight sessions. Bitemporal EOG was recorded with eyes open in darkness. Instructions were to ""gaze straight ahead,"" and indicate when ""rotation sensation disappears or becomes ambiguous"". Subjects were rotated CW and CCW head erect for 1 min at 120 degrees/s, stopped, and EOG was recorded for another 1 min. This procedure was then used to study dumping, except that immediately after chair stop, subjects pitched their head forward 90 degrees. SPV was calculated using order statistic filtering, and dropouts removed using an iterative model fitting method. Te and Td were determined by logarithmic linear regression of mean SPV for each subject. In orbit, 90 degrees pitch movement produced rapid subjective dumping, but not nystagmus dumping. Dd was noticeably shorter (""almost instantaneous"") compared to preflight Dd. Te and Td in orbit were similar to preflight Te for 3/4 subjects (rather than to preflight Td as expected). No consistent VOR gain changes were seen in orbit. Although Te is known to decrease acutely in parabolic flight, a longer time constant was measured in 3/4 subjects after 4-5 days adaptation to weightlessness, suggesting a return of angular velocity storage.",Excluded,0.038471643

3132,"Treatment of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma with image-guided high-dose rate, interstitial brachytherapy as second-line or salvage therapy. PURPOSE We aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of image-guided high-dose rate interstitial brachytherapy (iBT) for the treatment of patients with hepatic, lymphatic, and pancreatic metastases originating from gastric cancer, an entity rarely surgically treatable with curative intent. METHODS Twelve patients with a cumulative number of 36 metastases (29 liver, 2 pancreatic, 5 lymph node) from histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma received iBT between 2010 and 2016 and were retrospectively analyzed. Every patient underwent palliative chemotherapy prior to iBT. The iBT procedure employs a temporarily, intratumorally placed iridium-192 source in a single fraction with the goal of tumor cell eradication. Effectiveness was assessed clinically and by radiologic imaging every three months. RESULTS Local tumor control was achieved in 32 of all treated metastases (89%). Four lesions showed a local recurrence after 7 months. Lesion sizes varied from 9 to 102 mm with a median of 20 mm. The median progression-free survival was 6.6 months (range, 1.8-46.8 months). The median overall survival was 11.4 months (range, 5-47 months). One patient suffered a major complication following iBT, hepatic hematoma and abscess (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3), successfully dealt with by transcutaneous drainage. CONCLUSION iBT is an overall safe procedure, which facilitates high rates of local tumor control in treatment of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma.

Non-specific clinical presentations and paraclinical findings in osteoarticular brucellosis may mimic many other diseases and other causes of arthritis which could lead to misdiagnosis and mismanagement. We studied retrospectively the records of 232 patients with osteoarticular brucellosis who were admitted to the three teaching hospitals of Babol Medical Sciences University from April 2001 to September 2006. The distribution of osteoarticular involvement and their management were evaluated to determine if any cases had been misdiagnosed because of false negative serologic tests and who had, as a result, undergone inappropriate surgical interventions. Of 232 patients, 138 (59%) were male and 94 (41%) were female. Polyarthritis, monoarthritis, spondylitis and sacroilitis were seen in 91 (39%), 60 (26%), 43 (18.5%) and 38 (16.5%) patients, respectively. Two hundred and twenty-nine (98.7%) patients were diagnosed correctly and treated successfully; three (1.3%) were misdiagnosed and had been given inappropriate surgical interventions. Of these three patients, two (3.3%) were suffering from monoarthritis (hip joint) and one (2.3%) had spondylitis.",Excluded,0.039279457

This work aimed to determine the mean effectve dose of patents undergoing catheterizaton tests and to estmate the associated radiaton risk of malignancy. Material(s) and Method(s): Measurements were performed during 65 coronary angiographies (CA), 70 coronary angioplastes (PTCA) 27, radio fluoroscopy (RF) ablatons and 25 electro physiologies procedures in a dedicated laboratory. The procedures were undertaken with the Siemens and General Electric X-ray equipment. A dose area product (DAP) meter was also used. The DAP values and fluoroscopy tmes were recorded for each patent. Result(s): The mean DAP values and patent effectve doses were 19.53 Gy.cm2and 1.71 mSv for CA, 49.74 Gy.cm2 and 4.57 mSv for PTCA, 153.34 Gy.cm2and 16.38 mSv for ablatons and 14.88 Gy.cm2and 1.65 mSv for electrophysiology, respectvely. The patent radiaton risk was estmated at 13, 1.3, 1.3, 3.6 fatal cancer per 10000 procedures of ablatons, electrophysiology, CA and PTCA cases, respectvely. Conclusion(s): Results showed that the radiaton risk due to RF cardiac ablaton is higher than the other complicaton procedures so, efforts should be made to minimize patent radiaton risk from RF ablaton procedures. Also we found no clear correlaton between cardiologist level of experience and reduced level of patent's dose.Copyright © 2020 Novin Medical Radiation Institute.

3136,"Radiotherapy of Primary or Recurrent Bladder Cancer in the Very Elderly. AIM: The number of very elderly patients with cancer is growing and requires particular attention. The role of organ-sparing irradiation in patients with bladder cancer aged >=80 years was investigated., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 29 very elderly (>=80 years) patients irradiated for bladder cancer, 12 characteristics were analysed for survival: indication, gender, age, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), T-/N-category, tumour grade, pack years, smoking during irradiation, radiation dose, interruption of irradiation >5 days and concurrent chemotherapy., RESULTS: On univariate analysis, primary treatment (p=0.001), KPS >70 (p=0.026) and not smoking during radiotherapy (p<0.001) were associated with better survival. A strong trend for such association was observed for female gender (p=0.054), <40 pack years (p=0.064) and concurrent chemotherapy (p=0.061), and a trend for no interruption of irradiation (p=0.09). On multivariate analysis, primary treatment (p=0.006) and not smoking during radiotherapy (p=0.038) maintained significance., CONCLUSION: Very elderly patients irradiated for bladder cancer may benefit from concurrent chemotherapy. Smoking during irradiation and interruptions of irradiation should be avoided. Copyright© 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

3137,"Adjuvant Radiation and Chemoradiation for High-Risk Salivary Gland Malignancies: A 20-Year Single Institution Experience. Purpose/Objective(s): To report our institutional outcomes of patients with non-previously treated, high-risk salivary gland malignancies treated with surgery followed by adjuvant radiation (RT) and chemoradiation (CRT). Materials/Methods: From January 1997 to December 2017, 108 patients were treated with surgery, and adjuvant RT (n = 50) or CRT (n = 58) for high-risk pathologic features: perineural involvement (PNI), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), positive/close (<2mm) margin, high grade, extracapsular extension (ECE), or positive lymph nodes. Adjuvant RT was delivered in 2 Gy daily fractions, and adjuvant CRT was delivered for 4-6 alternating week cycles: the most common regimen, TFHX, consisted of 5 days paclitaxel (100 mg/m2 on d1), infusional 5-fluorouracil (600 mg/m2/d x 5d), hydroxyurea (500 mg PO BID), and 1.5 Gy twice daily irradiation followed by a 9-day break without treatment. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate rates of locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with LRC, DFS, and OS. Multivariable Cox Regression (MVA) was performed for known confounding risk factors, and factors associated with a trend to significance (p <0.20). Chi-Square was used to compare rates of toxicities between groups. Result(s): Median follow-up was 52 months (range: 3 - 226). The most common histologies included: Adenoid Cystic (n = 30), Mucoepidermoid (n = 20), and Salivary Duct Adenocarcinoma (n = 18). The most common location included the parotid (n = 73). The median RT dose was 66 Gy (range 43.2 - 74 Gy). The 5-year LRC was 88%, 5-year DFS was 57%, and 5-year OS was 78%. On MVA, LRC was not associated with any factors; DFS was associated with the size of the tumor (HR 2.0, p = 0.01), tumor location (HR 2.0, p = 0.01), and stage (HR 1.7, p = 0.02); and OS was associated with N stage (HR 2.3, p = 0.005), LVSI (HR 1.9, p = 0.012), ECE (HR 1.5, p = 0.032), and stage (HR 1.3, p = 0.05). CRT was not associated with improved LRC (HR 0.5, p = 0.34), DFS (HR 0.4, p = 0.44), or OS (HR: 0.46, p = 0.384). Since 87% of node positive patients were treated with adjuvant CRT compared to 13% with RT, therefore comparison was not possible. There was no difference in any acute or late grade 3+ toxicities, or parenteral nutrition between RT and CRT (p = 0.98, p = 0.85, and p = 0.83), respectively. There was one acute grade 5 toxicity in the RT group. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the largest single institution cohort of adjuvant CRT for high-risk salivary malignancies. Overall, adjuvant CRT doesn't enhance outcomes compared to adjuvant RT alone. However, LRC was similar between RT and CRT groups in spite of more adverse features (nodal disease and ECE) in the CRT group. Distant metastatic disease remains a significant pattern of failure. We await large prospective evidence to determine which subsets of patients benefit from adjuvant CRT.Copyright © 2019",Excluded,0.038248323

3139,"Clinical outcomes of 130 patients with primary and secondary lung tumors treated with Cyberknife robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy. Authors report clinical outcomes of patients treated with robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary, recurrent and metastatic lung lesions. 130 patients with 160 lesions were treated with Cyberknife SBRT, including T1-3 primary lung cancers (54%), recurrent tumors (22%) and pulmonary metastases (24%). The mean biologically equivalent dose (BED10Gy) was 151 Gy (72-180 Gy). Median prescribed dose for peripheral and central lesions was 3x20 Gy and 3x15 Gy, respectively. Local control (LC), overall survival (OS), and cause-specific survival (CSS) rates, early and late toxicities are reported. Statistical analysis was performed to identify factors influencing local tumor control. Median follow-up time was 21 months. In univariate analysis, higher dose was associated with better LC and a cut-off value was detected at BED10Gy <= 112.5 Gy, resulting in 1-, 2-, and 3-year actuarial LC rates of 93%, vs 73%, 80% vs 61%, and 63% vs 54%, for the high and low dose groups, respectively (p = 0.0061, HR = 0.384). In multivariate analysis, metastatic origin, histological confirmation and larger Planning Target Volume (PTV) were associated with higher risk of local failure. Actuarial OS and CSS rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 85%, 74% and 62%, and 93%, 89% and 80%, respectively. Acute and late toxicities >= Gr 3 were observed in 3 (2%) and 6 patients (5%), respectively. Our favorable LC and survival rates after robotic SBRT, with low rates of severe toxicities, are coherent with the literature data in this mixed, non-selected study population.Copyright © 2017 Radiol Oncol.",Excluded,0.03848244
3140,"Radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide for glioblastoma. BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor in adults, is usually rapidly fatal. The current standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is surgical resection to the extent feasible, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. In this trial we compared radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy plus temozolomide, given concomitantly with and after radiotherapy, in terms of efficacy and safety. METHOD(S): Patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed glioblastoma were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone (fractionated focal irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days per week for 6 weeks, for a total of 60 Gy) or radiotherapy plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day, 7 days per week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy), followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per square meter for 5 days during each 28-day cycle). The primary end point was overall survival. RESULT(S): A total of 573 patients from 85 centers underwent randomization. The median age was 56 years, and 84 percent of patients had undergone debulking surgery. At a median follow-up of 28 months, the median survival was 14.6 months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 12.1 months with radiotherapy alone. The unadjusted hazard ratio for death in the radiotherapy-plus-temozolomide group was 0.63 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.75; P<0.001 by the log-rank test). The two-year survival rate was 26.5 percent with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 10.4 percent with radiotherapy alone. Concomitant treatment with radiotherapy plus temozolomide resulted in grade 3 or 4 hematologie toxic effects in 7 percent of patients. CONCLUSION(S): The addition of temozolomide to radiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant survival benefit with minimal additional toxicity.

3141,"Evaluation of a novel normal database with matched SPECT systems and optimal pre-filter parameters for 3D-SSP. PURPOSE: A normal perfusion database (NDB) is imperative for the statistical imaging of brain function. This study validates a novel NDB created under the same injection dose and acquisition conditions for three gamma camera systems and evaluates optimal pre-filter parameters for three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSPs)., METHOD: We compared a novel NDB that matched the databases in each of three vendor gamma camera systems with a conventionally constructed NDB (conventional NDB) and a NDB constructed in-house for 3D-SSP. We generated hypoperfused regions where pre-specified volumes were simulated for various areas in SPECT images. The properties of each NDB were evaluated based on the distribution of the standard deviation (SD). Abnormal accumulation regions were validated using Z, extent, and artifactual scores. Detection error was used to evaluate the optimal Butterworth pre-filter cutoff frequency with the perfusion defect rate (PDR) in 3D-SSP., RESULTS: The SD distribution was the same in the novel NDB and in the NDB constructed in-house, and the SD of the peak distribution was 0.08-0.07. The Z and extent scores of the novel DB and the NDB constructed in-house were similar, but increased along with the artifactual scores when using the conventional NDB. Many artifacts appeared in the Z score map when using the conventional NDB. The detection error deviated from the actual value by -1.3% at a cutoff frequency of 0.58 cycles/cm and a PDR of 30%, which was the lowest. The cutoff frequency became lower or higher, and the low-perfusion defect rate increased according to the increasing detection error. The optimal cutoff frequency was between 0.52 and 0.58 cycles/cm., CONCLUSIONS: We generated a novel NDB according to the individual devices and compared it with a conventional and a NDB constructed in-house. The Z and extent scores were essentially equal when using the novel DB and the NDB constructed in-house, but considerably differed when using the conventional NDB. The optimal cutoff frequency of the Butterworth filter evaluated from the detection error was in the range of 0.52-0.58 cycles/cm. The detection error increased the perfusion defect rate by <15% and this was undetectable in 3D-SSP. The next step will be to improve the accuracy of the extent of abnormal regions and the sensitivity of the Z score using a novel NDB constructed according to the individual devices.",Excluded,0.038381908
3142,"Utility of dual-energy CT for predicting the vascularity of meningiomas. PURPOSE: Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) can provide iodine, electron density (ED), and effective atomic number Z (Zeff) maps, facilitating the identification of tissue types. We investigated whether DECT parameters can predict the vascularity of meningiomas., METHOD: We acquired DECT and perfusion CT (PCT) images in 24 patients with histologically diagnosed meningioma. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed at the tumor in iodine, ED, and Zeff maps derived from DECT and in a blood volume (BV) map derived from PCT. To normalize these parameters' values, we divided them by the values of contralateral normal-appearing white matter, i.e., the relative (r)ED, rZeff, and rBV. The vascular density of the tumor specimens was immunohistochemically analyzed by calculating the von Willebrand factor-positive vessel wall. We calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients to determine the correlation with PCT/DECT parameters and an immunohistopathological index., RESULTS: Contrast rZeff (r = 0.7020, p = 0.0001) and iodine (r = 0.5814, p = 0.0029) both had positive correlations with rBV derived from PCT. The rED values were negatively correlated with the rBV values (r = -0.4735, p = 0.0194), and the vascular density results confirmed positive correlations with rBV (r = 0.6909, p = 0.0002) and contrast rZeff (r = 0.4982, p = 0.0132) and a negative correlation with rED (r = -0.4265, p = 0.0377). Regarding the radiation exposure, the mean estimated volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) of DECT was 33.1 +/- 1.72 mGy, much lower than that of PCT (103.3 +/- 4.65 mGy)., CONCLUSIONS: DECT predicted vascular density with lower radiation exposure compared to PCT. DECT could potentially replace PCT for evaluating the vascularity of meningiomas. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.038307004
3143,"The interobserver reliability of the diagnosis and classification of scaphoid fractures using high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT. Aims Besides conventional radiographs, the use of MRI, CT, and bone scintigraphy is frequent in the diagnosis of a fracture of the scaphoid. However, which techniques give the best results remain unknown. The investigation of a new imaging technique initially requires an analysis of its precision. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the interobserver agreement of high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) in the diagnosis of a scaphoid fracture. A secondary aim was to investigate the interobserver agreement for the presence of other fractures and for the classification of scaphoid fracture. Methods Two radiologists and two orthopaedic trauma surgeons evaluated HR-pQCT scans of 31 patients with a clinically-suspected scaphoid fracture. The observers were asked to determine the presence of a scaphoid or other fracture and to classify the scaphoid fracture based on the Herbert classification system. Fleiss kappa statistics were used to calculate the interobserver agreement for the diagnosis of a fracture. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess the agreement for the classification of scaphoid fracture. Results A total of nine (29%) scaphoid fractures and 12 (39%) other fractures were diagnosed in 20 patients (65%) using HR-pQCT across the four observers. The interobserver agreement was 91% for the identification of a scaphoid fracture (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.00) and 80% for other fractures (95% CI 0.72 to 0.87). The mean ICC for the classification of a scaphoid fracture in the seven patients diagnosed with scaphoid fracture by all four observers was 73% (95% CI 0.42 to 0.94). Conclusion We conclude that the diagnosis of scaphoid and other fractures is reliable when using HR-pQCT in patients with a clinically-suspected fracture.Copyright © 2020 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.",Excluded,0.0384584

A total of 3313 adult patients with thyroid nodules and confirmed benign or malignant thyroid diagnoses were included. Result(s): Mean patient age was 54.2 (18-97) years, and the majority were women (n = 2635, 79.8%). A total of 3241 nodules were analyzed, 335 (10.3%) of which were malignant. Thyroid nodule location was an independent risk factor in predicting thyroid cancer (p = 0.005). Thyroid cancer odds were highest in the isthmus (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-3.6, p < 0.0001). In a multivariate regression model adjusting for age, sex, family history of thyroid cancer, radiation exposure, nodule size, and American College of Radiology (ACR) TI-RADS (Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System) score, the isthmus nodules had the highest risk of malignancy (OR = 2.4 [CI 1.5-3.9], p = 0.0007), followed by upper thyroid nodules (OR = 1.8 [CI 1.2-2.7], p = 0.005) and then middle thyroid nodules (OR = 1.5 [CI 1.1-2.0], p = 0.01) compared with lower thyroid nodules. Isthmus nodules were significantly smaller in size compared with middle (p < 0.0001) and lower (p = 0.0004), but not upper nodules (p = 0.25), with a mean size of 15.5 mm (+/-10.7).

Objective: To investigate the outcome of linac-based fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy over the last 10 years for intracranial skull base benign meningiomas in patients who were inoperable, who had residual tumors with some components of high mitotic index after surgery and who experienced relapse of the tumor. Method(s): Twenty-seven patients with intracranial skull base benign meningiomas treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-seven cases were diagnosed as benign meningiomas on pathological (17 cases) or radiological (10 cases) examination. The median follow-up time was 90 months after initial treatment and 63 months after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. The median biological equivalent dose calculated using an alpha/beta ratio of 2.0 Gy was 82.0 Gy (range, 60-106 Gy). Result(s): The 5-year overall survival was 95.7 (95% confidence interval: 87.3-100)% after initial treatment and 96.2 (88.8-100)% after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. The 5-year overall survival and local control rate of patients who received4/8/2011 fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy alone were both 100%. The 5-year progression-free survival and local control rate after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy were all 100% with a tumor volume of <9.1 cc and 68.2 (37.2-99.2) and 75.8 (45.2-100)% for the tumors 9.1 cc, respectively. The difference was significant in progression-free survival (P = 0.022) and local control rate (P = 0.044). The local control rate was significantly worse in patients who received fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for relapsed tumors (P = 0.01). No late radiation damage was observed in the follow-up period. Conclusion(s): The long-term outcome suggests that fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is a safe and effective treatment for intracranial skull base benign meningioma, especially for those who have tumors <9.1 cc or would receive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with or without surgery as the initial treatment. © The Author (2010).

Purpose Bevacizumab and stereotactic treatment are efficient combined or alone in relapse glioma. However, patterns of relapse after this kind of salvage treatment have never been studied. The purpose of this unicentric retrospective analysis was to assess and understand the patterns of relapse of high grade glioma treated with stereotactic radiation, with or without bevacizumab. Patients and methods Twenty patients with high grade glioma relapse received a stereotactic radiation; among them two patients received temozolomide and eight patients received bevacizumab; among the latter, four received also irinotecan. We matched the stereotactic radiation treatment planning scan with the images of the first treatment and of the second relapse in order to determine the patterns of failure and associate dosimetric profile. Results For the total population, median follow-up from the first diagnosis and relapse were 46.1 and 17.6 months, respectively. Among the 13 patients who relapsed, ten did not receive chemotherapy and three received it (P < 0.05), two received temozolomide and one bevacizumab. Patients who received bevacizumab had no ""out-of-field"" recurrences. Among the 32 irradiated relapses, 15 were ""in-field"" recurrences; among them two were treated with bevacizumab and 13 were not (P < 0.05). For the 32 lesions, a favourable prognostic factor of control was the association of a high-dose of irradiation and the use of bevacizumab.

Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy for head and neck cancer by investigating the patterns of failure after this therapy. Method(s): A retrospective chart review was performed. Result(s): Between March 2006 and December 2013, 122 consecutive patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were treated by surgery followed by postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy. In regard to the site of the primary tumor, 59 (48%) patients had cancer of the oral cavity, 31 (26%) patients had cancer of the hypopharynx, 14 (11%) patients had cancer of the oropharynx, 10 (8%) patients had cancer of the larynx and 8 (7%) patients had cancer of unknown primary. The median follow-up period of the surviving patients was 54 months (range, 25-115). Concurrent chemotherapy was administered in 76 patients (62%). The median prescribed radiation dose was 66 Gy. The 3-year overall survival, progression-free survival, distant metastasis free survival and loco-regional control rates were 59%, 48%, 52.4% and 71%, respectively. Of the 122 patients, 32 developed loco-regional recurrence as the initial recurrence, including in-field recurrence in 26 patients, marginal recurrence in five patients and out-field recurrence in seven patients. Of the five patients with marginal recurrence, four have had two or more surgeries before the intensity-modulated radiotherapy and three had oral cavity cancer. Severe adverse events were not frequent, occurring at a frequency of <5%, except for mucositis. No severe toxicities associated with the flap reconstruction were observed either. Conclusion(s): Postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy appears to be effective and feasible for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Copyright © The Author 2016.

Background and purpose: Radiation-esophagitis and weight loss are frequently observed toxicities in patients treated with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CT-RT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and might be related. The purpose was to investigate whether weight loss already starts early after initiation of CT-RT and precedes radiation-esophagitis. Material(s) and Method(s): In a retrospective cohort, weight and esophagitis grade >=2 were assessed during the first weeks of (CT-)RT in patients treated with concurrent (n = 102) or sequential (n = 92) therapy. In a prospective validation study, data on body weight, esophagitis grade >=2, nutritional intake and muscle strength were obtained before, during and following CT-RT. Result(s): In the retrospective cohort, early weight loss was observed in concurrently treated patients (p = 0.002), independent of esophagitis >= grade 2. Early weight loss was also observed in the prospective cohort (p = 0.003) and was not accompanied by decreases in nutritional intake. In addition lower limb muscle strength rapidly declined (p = 0.042). In the later weeks of treatment, further body weight loss occurred (p < 0.001) despite increased nutritional supplementation and body weight was only partly recovered after 4 weeks post CT-RT (p = 0.003). Conclusion(s): Weight loss during concurrent CT-RT for NSCLC starts early and prior to onset of esophagitis, requiring timely and intense nutritional rehabilitation. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded,0.038573194
3152,"Radiation-induced comet-formation in human skin fibroblasts from radiotherapy patients with different normal tissue reactions. Background: In clinical radiotherapy most patients tolerate the applied dosage with no or moderate side effects. However, 5 to 10% of all individuals show increased acute and/or late reactions. In-vitro test systems are investigated for their suitability for predictive purposes. This paper attempts a correlation between the induction and repair of DNA damage measured in the comet assay and the clinical observed reaction in order to evaluate the suitability of the comet assay for prediction of radiation sensitivity. Patients and Methods: Skin fibroblasts of 30 patients with average tissue reactions or acute and/or late increased side effects and cell lines of 4 individuals carrying the heritable disease ataxia telangiectasia (AT) were irradiated in vitro. The induction and repair of DNA damage was measured at different time points after irradiation in the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis). These results were compared to the acute and late clinical reactions classified according to the RTOG grading system. Result(s): The radiation induced DNA damage decreased over time reflecting DNA repair. Cells of the AT individuals showed an elevated damage induction and a reduced repair capacity compared to patients with average tissue reactions. Fibroblasts of patients with increased acute and late side effects exhibited slower DNA repair. In addition to the known lack of cell cycle control, our results indicate that AT cells show reduced DNA repair capacity. Conclusion(s): The comet assay seems to be able to detect some types of increased individual radiation sensitivity. In contrast to other predictive in-vitro tests, the comet assay needs less time and fewer cells, which would be useful in a clinical setting.",Included,0.97075224
3153,"Cataract and latitude. For many years, it has been suggested that exposure to sunlight, particularly its ultraviolet component, may be associated with an increased risk of senile cataract. This paper addresses 1) the physical and geographic variables that affect the entry of ultraviolet light in the eye; 2) the epidemiologic evidence that associates cataract with ultraviolet light exposure; and 3) the effectiveness of personal barrier protection (i.e. sunglasses and hats) in reducing ocular exposure to ultraviolet light. The epidemiologic evidence is drawn from studies in Australia, China, Tibet, and the United States. The U.S. evidence consists of data from the Maryland Watermen study and analyses of cataract surgery under the Medicare program which provides health insurance for nearly all Americans age 65 and over (30 million) and pays for 85% of the 1.3 million cataract extractions performed annually in the U.S. Analysis of the Medicard data shown that, after controlling for age, sex, and race, and income of the population and also controlling for supply of ophthalmologists, optometrists, price of surgery and local practice costs, the strongest predictor of cataract surgery likelihood in a Medicare beneficiary is the person's latitude of residence. Latitude correlates directly with the UV-B content of sunlight, because the incident angle of the sun determines the atmospheric penetration of ultraviolet radiation. Data suggest that the probability of cataract surgery in the U.S. increases by 3% for each 1 degree decrease (i.e. more Southerly) in latitude.",Excluded,0.03856117
3154,"Synchronous Chemoradiotherapy in Patients with Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck using Capecitabine: A Single-centre, Open-label, Single-group Phase II Study. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of concurrent oral capecitabine with accelerated hypofractionated radical radiotherapy in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2001 and 2004, 50 patients with stage III/IV SCCHN (0 to 2 performance status) were enrolled into this study. The capecitabine dose was between 450 and 550mg/m2 twice daily, continuously for 28 days. The radiotherapy dose was 5500cGy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. No intensity-modulated radiation was used. We evaluated the complete response rate, toxicity, locoregional control, overall survival, disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival. Result(s): The median age was 55 (range 38-76) years; 72% had stage IV disease. The median follow-up was 6 years on the 30 surviving patients. Eighty-two per cent of patients completed the course of capecitabine and 94% completed prescribed radiotherapy. There were no treatment-related deaths, grade 3/4 haematological or renal toxicity. Five patients developed drug-related grade 3/4 acute toxicity (cardiac, skin, bowel); 47 developed grade 3/4 mucositis from chemoradiotherapy. Twenty-two (44%) patients required tube feeding and the tube dependency rate at 1 year was 6%. The complete response rate at 3 months was 90% (45/50 patients). Relapse occurred in 17/50 (34%) patients by 5 years. The locoregional control, overall survival, cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival rates at 3 years were 78, 72, 82 and 62%, respectively, and at 5 years were 72, 64, 75 and 56%, respectively. Conclusion(s): This schedule of synchronous capecitabine for locally advanced SCCHN is well tolerated. The local control in this series compares favourably with other synchronous chemoradiotherapy reports. Chronic dysphagia and tube dependence is uncommon with this approach. Capecitabine as targeted therapy given with each fraction of radiotherapy and administered orally may have significant advantages over intravenous, 3 weekly cisplatin. © 2010 The Royal College of Radiologists.",Excluded,0.03847553
3155,"Reduced end-systolic pressure-volume ratio response to exercise: A marker of subclinical myocardial disease in type 2 diabetes. Background-Limitations in the predictive value of negative exercise echocardiography in type 2 diabetes mellitus has been linked to a reduced end-systolic pressure-volume response (ESPVR). We sought whether abnormal ESPVR reflected subclinical diabetic heart disease by examining the association between the ESPVR and markers of myocardial dysfunction and to establish if the change (delta) or peak systolic blood pressure/end-systolic left ventricular volume ratio (SP/ESV) is a better marker of contractile reserve in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods and Results-Resting and exercise echocardiography was performed in 167 apparently healthy patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (97 men; age, 55+/-10 years) without ischemia, other cardiac disease, or noncardiac complications of diabetes. Standard echocardiographic and color tissue Doppler measures (early diastolic tissue velocity, strain, and strain rate) were acquired at baseline and peak stress in apical long-axis views. Calibrated integrated backscatter was calculated from a resting parasternal long-axis view. deltaSP/ESV was calculated as [(peak stress SP/ESV)-(rest SP/ESV)]. The 83 subjects who demonstrated a deltaSP/ESV <=12 mm Hg/mL/m2 after exercise were older and had lower peak heart rate, resting diastolic and stress systolic tissue velocity, stress ejection fraction, and exercise capacity than the remainder. There was no significant association between deltaSP/ESV and metabolic derangement or echocardiographic measures of deformation or backscatter. Change in Sm and stress ejection fraction were independent correlates of deltaSP/ESV. Conclusions-deltaSP/ESV ratio is associated with established features of subclinical diabetic heart disease as well as determinants of contractile reserve (peak hemodynamic response and stress systolic function). Peak ESPVR is poorly associated with markers of myocardial dysfunction. © 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.",Excluded,0.039131038
3156,"Comparing outcomes of stereotactic body radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. OBJECTIVES: Survival in patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAUPC) is poor, and local recurrence continues to be a major problem in the management of this disease. Radiotherapy (RT) using different RT techniques, including intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), may lead to different clinical outcomes for patients with LAUPC. Here, we compared SBRT with IMRT for patients with LAUPC with respect to survival rate, local control (LC) rate, and toxicity-related dose distribution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study from March 2007 to March 2011 included 41 patients with LAUPC who were divided into two groups, with 20 patients receiving SBRT and 21 patients receiving IMRT. The median follow-up time was 16 months. RESULT(S): For the IMRT and SBRT groups, the median survival times were 13 and 20 months, and 1-year overall survival (OS) rates were 70.7 and 80.0%, respectively. There was no difference in OS between the two RT techniques. RT with SBRT showed significantly better local disease-free survival than IMRT for patients with LAUPC. Tobacco use had a borderline effect on LC. Thus, further statistical analysis showed that patients who used tobacco had better LC after receiving SBRT than IMRT. CONCLUSION(S): SBRT improved LC for LAUPC patients and had similar radiation toxicity compared with IMRT. Further study is required to define the effects of administered radiation dose and fractionation, as well as to further expand the sample size, to use a prospective study, and to observe the long-term efficacy of these techniques..Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The Italian National Centre for Oncological Hadrontherapy (Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica, CNAO), equipped with a proton and ion synchrotron, started clinical activity in September 2011. The clinical and technical characteristics of the first ten proton beam radiotherapy treatments are reported. Ten patients, six males and four females (age range 27-73 years, median 55.5), were treated with proton beam radiotherapy. After one to two surgical procedures, seven patients received a histological diagnosis of chordoma (of the skull base in three cases, the cervical spine in one case and the sacrum in three cases) and three of low-grade chondrosarcoma (skull base). Prescribed doses were 74 GyE for chordoma and 70 GyE for chondrosarcoma at 2 GyE/fraction delivered 5 days per week. Treatment was well tolerated without toxicity-related interruptions. The maximal acute toxicity was grade 2, with oropharyngeal mucositis, nausea and vomiting for the skull base tumours, and grade 2 dermatitis for the sacral tumours. After 6-12 months of follow-up, no patient developed tumour progression. The analysis of the first ten patients treated with proton therapy at CNAO showed that this treatment was feasible and safe.

BACKGROUND: The occupational hazards of working in the interventional laboratory have been inadequately studied for physicians and remain unaddressed for nonphysician personnel., OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal pain, cancer, and other medical conditions is higher among physicians and allied staff who work in interventional laboratories compared with employees who do not., METHODS: Mayo Clinic employees who work in affiliated hospitals with interventional cardiology or interventional radiology laboratories took an electronic survey. Results were stratified on the basis of self-reported occupational exposure to procedures that involve radiation., RESULTS: There were 1,543 employees (mean age 43 +/- 11.3 years, 33% male) who responded to the survey (response rate of 57%), and 1,042 (67.5%) reported being involved with procedures utilizing radiation. These employees reported experiencing work-related pain more often than the control group before (54.7% vs. 44.7%; p < 0.001) and after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions, years in profession, and job description (odds ratio: 1.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.32 to 2.11; p < 0.001). Musculoskeletal pain varied significantly by job description, with the highest incidence reported by technicians (62%) and nurses (60%) followed by attending physicians (44%) and trainees (19%; p < 0.001). There was no difference in cancer prevalence between groups (9% vs. 9%; p = 0.96)., CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal pain is more common among healthcare workers who participate in interventional procedures and is highest in nonphysician employees. The diagnosis of cancer in employees who participate in procedures that utilize radiation was not elevated when compared to controls within the same departments, although any conclusion regarding causality is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the study, as well as the low overall prevalence of malignancy in our study group.

3159,"Image Quality Assessment of Abdominal CT by Use of New Deep Learning Image Reconstruction: Initial Experience. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to perform quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) algorithm in contrast-enhanced oncologic CT of the abdomen. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Retrospective review (April-May 2019) of the cases of adults undergoing oncologic staging with portal venous phase abdominal CT was conducted for evaluation of standard 30% adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction V (30% ASIR-V) reconstruction compared with DLIR at low, medium, and high strengths. Attenuation and noise measurements were performed. Two radiologists, blinded to examination details, scored six categories while comparing reconstructions for overall image quality, lesion diagnostic confidence, artifacts, image noise and texture, lesion conspicuity, and resolution. RESULTS. DLIR had a better contrast-to-noise ratio than 30% ASIR-V did; high-strength DLIR performed the best. High-strength DLIR was associated with 47% reduction in noise, resulting in a 92-94% increase in contrast-to-noise ratio compared with that of 30% ASIR-V. For overall image quality and image noise and texture, DLIR scored significantly higher than 30% ASIR-V with significantly higher scores as DLIR strength increased. A total of 193 lesions were identified. The lesion diagnostic confidence, conspicuity, and artifact scores were significantly higher for all DLIR levels than for 30% ASIR-V. There was no significant difference in perceived resolution between the reconstruction methods. CONCLUSION. Compared with 30% ASIR-V, DLIR improved CT evaluation of the abdomen in the portal venous phase. DLIR strength should be chosen to balance the degree of desired denoising for a clinical task relative to mild blurring, which increases with progressively higher DLIR strengths.",Excluded,0.038538504
3160,"HOPE for Rational Statin Allocation for Primary Prevention: A Coronary Artery Calcium Picture Is Worth 1000 Words. Allocation of statin therapy for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in borderline- and intermediate-risk patients has traditionally been based on population-based global risk assessment and other clinical and laboratory characteristics. Patient-specific treatment decisions are needed to provide maximal benefit and avoid unnecessary treatment. Guideline-based lipid management proposes that coronary artery calcium scoring is reasonable to implement in patients with a 10-year risk of 5.0% to 19.9% (borderline to intermediate risk) by using the pooled cohort equations when the decision about whether to initiate statin therapy is uncertain. We report data from both observational studies and a large primary prevention randomized controlled trial that support the position that this decision is, in fact, uncertain in about half of such patients because of risk misclassification. Such misclassification can be largely avoided by more widespread implementation of coronary calcium scoring, which helps to identify those with coronary artery calcium scores of 0, a finding associated with a less than 5.0% 10-year probability of an ASCVD event. Deferral of statin therapy in such patients, in the absence of smoking, diabetes, or a family history of premature ASCVD, provides more individualized and appropriate care and avoids the expense and potential adverse effects of statin therapy in those with low potential for absolute risk reduction. A rationale is also provided for the importance of coronary artery calcium scoring in women 50 years and older, possibly in place of 1 screening mammogram in women at least 55 years of age to avoid incremental radiation exposure, on the basis of the substantially higher lifetime risk of morbidity and mortality from ASCVD than from breast cancer. In patients with borderline or intermediate ASCVD risk, coronary artery calcium scoring should be used, whenever possible, as an aid to rational statin allocation for the primary prevention of ASCVD.

3163,"Removal of Antiscatter Grids for Spinal Digital Subtraction Angiography: Dose Reduction without Loss of Diagnostic Value. Background Spinal digital subtraction angiography (DSA) exposes patients and operators to substantial amounts of radiation. Antiscatter grid (ASG) removal is used to decrease radiation exposure but may reduce image quality. Purpose To determine whether ASG removal during spinal DSA in adults reduces radiation dose while maintaining diagnostic image quality and whether dose reduction is related to body mass index (BMI). Materials and Methods This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant prospective study included adults undergoing spinal DSA between January and December 2016. Each procedure included an additional angiographic acquisition performed twice, once with and once without ASG, either documenting the artery of Adamkiewicz (no pathology group) or the condition leading to the procedure (pathology group). Dose differences between study acquisitions and the influence of BMI were evaluated via paired t test. Two neurointerventionalists blinded to acquisition protocols were asked to independently evaluate a sample of 40 study acquisitions (20 with ASG, 20 without ASG) from 20 randomly selected participants to (a) rate image quality, (b) categorize findings, and (c) determine whether images had been obtained with or without ASG. Percentage agreement on image quality, findings categorization, and ability to correctly identify the acquisition protocol was calculated for both readers. Results Fifty-three participants (mean age +/- standard deviation, 51 years +/- 15.2; 32 men) were evaluated. ASG removal reduced the mean dose per acquisition by approximately 33% (mean dose-area product and air kerma decreased from 202 to 135.6 microGy/m2 and from 35.3 to 24 mGy, respectively; P < .001) independently of BMI (P = .3). Both readers evaluated all images (40 of 40) as being of diagnostic quality and correctly categorized findings in 19 of 20 (95%) cases.

3164,"Outcome of three-fraction gamma knife radiosurgery for brain metastases according to fractionation scheme: preliminary results. Purpose: The optimal interfraction intervals for fractionated radiosurgery has yet to be established. We investigated the outcome of fractionated gamma knife radiosurgery (FGKRS) for large brain metastases (BMs) according to different interfraction intervals. Method(s): Between September 2016 and May 2018, a total of 45 patients who underwent FGKRS for BMs were enrolled in this study. They were divided into two groups (standard fractionation over 3 consecutive days with a 24-h interfraction interval versus prolonged fractionation over 4 or 5 days with an interfraction interval of at least 48-h). BMs with >= 2 cm in maximum diameter or >= 5 cm3 in volume were included in analysis. Result(s): Among 52 BMs treated with 3-fraction GKRS, 25 (48.1%) were treated with standard fractionation scheme, and 27 (51.9%) with prolonged fractionation scheme. The median follow-up period was 10.5 months (range 5-25). Local tumor control rates of the standard group were 88.9% at 6 months and 77.8% at 12 months, whereas those of the prolonged group were 100% at 6 and 12 months (p = 0.023, log-rank test). In multivariate analysis, fractionation scheme (hazard ratio [HR] 0.294, 95% CI 0.099-0.873; p = 0.027) and tumor volume (HR 0.200, 95% CI 0.051-0.781; p = 0.021) were revealed as the only significant factors affecting the local tumor control after 3-fraction GKRS. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary tumor control results suggest a promising role of 3-fraction GKRS with an interfraction interval of at least 48-h.

Several studies suggest that dietary supplementation with antioxidant can influence the response to chemotherapy as well as the development of adverse side effects caused by treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. Using CBA mouse model, we investigated a clinically potential use of a water-soluble derivative of propolis (WSDP) in the treatment of various cytopenias induced by radiation and/or chemotherapy. Also, the antimetastatic efficiency of WSDP given intraperitoneally alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents and their effects on the blood leukocytes count as well as on hematopoiesis were studied. Tumor was a transplantable mammary carcinoma (MCa) of CBA mouse. Metastases in the lung were generated by injecting viable tumor cells intravenously (iv). WSDP (50 or 150 mg/kg) exerted a significant antimetastatic effect (P < 0.001) when given either before or after tumor cell inoculation. In combined treatment WSDP and Epirubicin profoundly inhibited metastasis formation; this synergistic effect is maximal when Epirubicin and WSDP were administrated after tumor cell inoculation. Positive outcome of combined treatment with WSDP and Epirubicin was also found regarding the number of red and white blood cells in peripheral blood while in mice treated with Epirubicin alone the significant drop in all hematological parameters was noticed on day 13 after tumor cell inoculation. Furthermore, when WSDP (50 mg/kg) was given perorally (po) for 20 consecutive days an increased number of exogenous CFUs was found in treated mice. WSDP given either for 20 or 40 days increased cellularity of hematopoietic tissue and the number of leucocytes in peripheral blood; prolonged treatment with WSDP also elevated myeloid and megakaryocytic types of CFUs. To conclude, these findings indicate that the combination of WSDP with chemotherapeutics could increase the antimetastatic potential of chemotherapeutic agents; these findings suggest the benefits of potential clinical trials using WSDP combined with chemotherapeutic agents in order to maximize their antitumor activity and minimize postchemotherapeutic or radiotherapeutic deteriorated reactions.",Excluded,0.041352797

PURPOSE: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MRI is a tool that can characterize changes in susceptibility, an intrinsic property which is associated with compositional changes in the tissue. Current QSM estimation of cortical bone is challenging because conventional clinical MRI cannot acquire signal in cortical bone. This study aimed to implement Cones 3D ultrashort echo time MRI (UTE-MRI) for ex vivo QSM measurements in human tibial cortical bone, investigating the correlations of QSM with volumetric intracortical bone mineral density (BMD)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine tibial midshaft cortical bone specimens (25mm long specimens cut at the mid-point of tibial shaft, 67+/-20years old, 5 women and 4 men) were scanned on a clinical 3T MRI scanner for QSM measurement. The specimens were also scanned on a high-resolution micro-computed tomography (muCT) scanner for volumetric BMD estimation. QSM and muCT results were compared at approximately nine regions of interest (ROIs) per specimen., RESULTS: Average 3D UTE-MRI QSM showed significantly strong correlation with volumetric BMD (R=-0.82, P<0.01) and bone porosity (R=0.72, P<0.01). Combining all data points together (77 ROIs), QSM showed significant moderate to strong correlation with volumetric BMD after correction for interdependencies in specimens (R=-0.70, P<0.01). The corrections were required because the data points were not independent in each specimen. Similarly, the correlation between QSM and porosity was significant (R=0.68, P<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the Cones 3D UTE-MRI QSM technique can potentially serve as a novel and accurate tool to assess intracortical bone mineral density whilst avoiding ionizing radiation.

3167,"Volumetric mapping of bound and pore water as well as collagen protons in cortical bone using 3D ultrashort echo time cones MR imaging techniques. Cortical bone assessment using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently received great attention in an effort to avoid the potential harm associated with ionizing radiation-based techniques. Ultrashort echo time MRI (UTE-MRI) techniques can acquire signal from major hydrogen proton pools in cortical bone, including bound and pore water, as well as from the collagen matrix. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a technique for mapping bound water, pore water, and collagen proton densities in human cortical bone ex vivo and in vivo using three-dimensional UTE Cones (3D-UTE-Cones) MRI. Eight human tibial cortical bone specimens (63+/-19years old) were scanned using 3D-UTE-Cones sequences on a clinical 3T MRI scanner and a micro-computed tomography (muCT) scanner. Total, bound, and pore water proton densities (TWPD, BWPD, and PWPD, respectively) were measured using UTE and inversion recovery UTE (IR-UTE) imaging techniques. Macromolecular proton density (MMPD), a collagen representation, was measured using TWPD and macromolecular fraction (MMF) obtained from two-pool UTE magnetization transfer (UTE-MT) modeling. The correlations between proton densities and muCT-based measures were investigated. The 3D-UTE-Cones techniques were further applied on ten young healthy (34+/-3years old) and five old (78+/-6years old) female volunteers to evaluate the techniques' feasibility for translational clinical applications. In the ex vivo study, PWPD showed the highest correlations with bone porosity and bone mineral density (BMD) (R=0.79 and -0.70, p<0.01). MMPD demonstrated moderate to strong correlations with bone porosity and BMD (R=-0.67 and 0.65, p<0.01). MMPD showed strong correlation with age in specimens from female donors (R=-0.91, p=0.03, n=5). The presented comprehensive 3D-UTE-Cones imaging protocol allows quantitative mapping of protons in major pools of cortical bone ex vivo and in vivo. PWPD and MMPD can serve as potential novel biomarkers to assess bone matrix and microstructure, as well as bone age- or injury-related variations. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the effect of treatment interruptions due to high-grade (> or =3) toxicity on outcome of patients with early stage (I/II) non-small-cell lung cancer treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy (Hfx RT). Of 116 patients treated with total tumour doses of 69.6 Gy, 1.2 Gy b.i.d. fractionation, 44 patients refused surgery while 72 patients were medically inoperable due to existing co-morbid states. Patients who were medically inoperable had worse KPS (P=0.0059) and more pronounced weight loss (P=0.0005). Among them, 12 patients experienced high-grade toxicity and 11 of them with either acute (n=6) or ""consequential"" late (n=5) high-grade toxicity requested interruption in the Hfx RT course (range, 12-25 days; median, 17 days). Superior survival (OS) was observed in patients who refused surgery when compared to those who were medically inoperable (P=0.0041), as well as superior local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) (P=0.011), but not different distant metastasis-free survival (P=0.14).

Multivariate analysis showed independent influence of the reason for not undergoing surgery on OS (P=0.035), but not on LRFS (P=0.084) or CSS (P=0.068). Patients who refused surgery did not experience high-grade toxicity (0/44), whereas 11 of 72 patients with medical inoperability and co-morbid states experienced high-grade toxicity and had treatment interruptions to manage toxicity (P=0.0064). Patients without treatment interruptions had significantly better OS (P=0.00000), LRFS (P=0.00000) and CSS (P=0.00000) than those with treatment interruptions. When corrected for treatment interruptions, the reason for not undergoing surgery independently influenced OS (P=0.040), but not LRFS (P=0.092) or CSS (P=0.068). In contrast to this, treatment interruption was independent prognosticator of all three endpoints used (P=0.00031, P=0.0075 and P=0.00033, respectively). When 11 patients with treatment interruptions were excluded, the reason for not undergoing surgery still affected OS (P=0.037) and CSS (P=0.039) but not LRFS (P=0.11). Multivariate analyses using OS, CSS and LRFS showed that the reason for not undergoing surgery affected OS (P=0.0436), but neither CSS (P=0.083) nor LRFS (P=0.080).",Excluded,0.041416414
3170,"Prognostic significance of pre-treatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with oropharyngeal cancer treated with radiotherapy. Background: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of pre-treatment NLR in patients with oropharyngeal cancer. Method(s): Patients who completed definitive radiotherapy (RT) for oropharyngeal cancer and had blood counts taken pre-RT from 2002 to 2013 were included. NLR was calculated as total neutrophil/lymphocytes. Survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted with linear and Cox regression methods. NLR was analysed posteriori and dichotomised on the discovered median. Result(s): Eight hundred and forty-eight patients were analysed. The median pre-RT NLR was 3. Patients with NLR of <3 had improved overall survival (OS) than those with NLR >= 3 (5-year OS 85 vs 74%, p < 0.0001). OS differences remained significant when stratified according to HPV status (HPV-positive p = 0.011; HPV-negative p = 0.003). Freedom from any recurrence (FFR), locoregional control (LRC) and freedom of distant recurrence (FDR) were better in those with NLR < 3. The negative impact of elevated pre-RT NLR on OS (HR = 1.64, p = 0.001), FFR (HR = 1.6, p = 0.006) and LRC (HR = 1.8, p = 0.005) remained significant on multivariable analysis. Conclusion(s): Pre-RT NLR is an independent prognostic factor in patients with oropharyngeal cancer regardless of HPV status. Patients with lower NLR had more favourable OS and disease control.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Cancer Research UK.",Excluded,0.03901482
3171,"Probability of receiving a high cumulative radiation dose and primary clinical indication of CT examinations: A 5-year observational cohort study. Objective High radiation exposure is a concern because of the association with cancer. The objective was to determine the probability of receiving a high radiation dose from CT (from one or more examinations within a 5-year period) and to assess the clinical context by evaluating clinical indications in the high-dose patient group. Design Observational cohort study. Effective radiation dose received from one or more CT examinations within a predefined 5-year calendar period was assessed for each patient. Setting Hospital setting. Participants All patients undergoing a diagnostic CT examination between July 2013 and July 2018 at the Maastricht University Medical Center. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was the probability of receiving a high effective dose, defined as >=100 mSv, from one or more CT examinations within 5 years as derived from a time-to-event analysis. Secondary outcomes were the clinical indication for the initial scan of patients receiving a high effective dose. Results 100 672 CT examinations were performed among 49 978 patients including 482 (1%) who received a high radiation dose. The estimated probability of a high effective dose from a single examination is low (0.002% (95% CI 0.00% to 0.01%)). The 4.5-year probability of receiving a high cumulative effective dose was 1.9% (95% CI 1.6% to 2.2%) for women and 1.5% (95% CI 1.3% to 1.7%) for men. The probability was highest in age categories between 51 and 74 years. A total of 2711 (5.5%) of patients underwent more than six CT examinations, and the probability of receiving a high effective dose was 16%. Among patients who received a high effective dose, most indications (80%) were oncology related. Conclusions The probability of receiving a high radiation dose from CT examinations is small but not negligible. In the majority (80%) of high effective dose receiving patients, the indication for the initial CT scan was oncology related.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

3172,"Spinal Cord Stimulator-Trial Lead Migration Study. Objectives. Investigate whether percutaneous spinal cord stimulator (SCS) leads migrate significantly during a 3-day trial, and determine whether the skin anchoring method influences lead migration. Material and Methods. Twenty patients were prospectively enrolled. Ten leads were anchored with suture and tape and 10 were anchored with tape only. A standardized X-ray protocol of lead position was obtained immediately following lead placement and upon completion of the trial. Results. Using a standardized method, SCS leads were measured and movement was calculated. The average movement for leads anchored with tape only was 8.72mm (SD=5.77), inferiorly; while movement for leads anchored with suture and tape was 24.49mm (SD=11.3), inferiorly. A t-test revealed a significant difference between the groups (t=3.9, P=0.001). Conclusions. Percutaneous SCS trial electrodes migrate significantly, inferiorly, during a 3-day trial. Anchoring the trial electrodes to the skin with a suture and tape results in significantly greater inferior migration when compared with anchoring the lead with tape only.

3174,"A phase II study of submandibular gland transfer prior to radiation for prevention of radiation-induced xerostomia in head-and-neck cancer (RTOG 0244). PURPOSE: We report the results of a phase II study to determine the reproducibility of a submandibular salivary gland transfer (SGT) surgical technique for prevention of radiation (XRT)-induced xerostomia in a multi-institutional setting and to assess severity of xerostomia., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible patients had surgery for primary, neck dissection, and SGT, followed by XRT, during which the transferred salivary gland was shielded. Intensity modulated radiation therapy, amifostine, and pilocarpine were not allowed, but postoperative chemotherapy was allowed. Each operation was reviewed by 2 reviewers and radiation by 1 reviewer. If 13 or more (of 43) were ""not per protocol,"" then the technique would be considered not reproducible as per study design. The secondary endpoint was the rate of acute xerostomia, grade 2 or higher, and a rate of <= 51% was acceptable., RESULTS: Forty-four of the total 49 patients were analyzable: male (81.8%), oropharynx (63.6%), stage IV (61.4%), median age 56.5 years. SGT was ""per protocol"" or within acceptable variation in 34 patients (77.3%) and XRT in 79.5%. Nine patients (20.9%) developed grade 2 acute xerostomia; 2 had grade 0-1 xerostomia (4.7%) but started on amifostine/pilocarpine. Treatment for these 11 patients (25.6%) was considered a failure for the xerostomia endpoint. Thirteen patients died; median follow-up for 31 surviving patients was 2.9 years. Two-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 76.4% and 71.7%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The technique of submandibular SGT is reproducible in a multicenter setting.

3177,"Predictors of toxicity associated with stereotactic body radiation therapy to the central hepatobiliary tract. PURPOSE: To identify dosimetric predictors of hepatobiliary (HB) toxicity associated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for liver tumors., METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed 96 patients treated with SBRT for primary (53%) or metastatic (47%) liver tumors between March 2006 and November 2013. The central HB tract (cHBT) was defined by a 15-mm expansion of the portal vein from the splenic confluence to the first bifurcation of left and right portal veins. Patients were censored for toxicity upon local progression or additional liver-directed therapy. HB toxicities were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. To compare different SBRT fractionations, doses were converted to biologically effective doses (BED) by using the standard linear quadratic model alpha/beta = 10 (BED10)., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12.7 months after SBRT. Median BED10 was 85.5 Gy (range: 37.5-151.2). The median number of fractions was 5 (range: 1-5), with 51 patients (53.1%) receiving 5 fractions and 29 patients (30.2%) receiving 3 fractions. In total, there were 23 (24.0%) grade 2+ and 18 (18.8%) grade 3+ HB toxicities. Nondosimetric factors predictive of grade 3+ HB toxicity included cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) histology (P<.0001), primary liver tumor (P=.0087), and biliary stent (P<.0001). Dosimetric parameters most predictive of grade 3+ HB toxicity were volume receiving above BED10 of 72 Gy (VBED1072) >= 21 cm(3) (relative risk [RR]: 11.6, P<.0001), VBED1066 >= 24 cm(3) (RR: 10.5, P<.0001), and mean BED10 (DmeanBED10) cHBT >=14 Gy (RR: 9.2, P<.0001), with VBED1072 and VBED1066 corresponding to V40 and V37.7 for 5 fractions and V33.8 and V32.0 for 3 fractions, respectively. VBED1072 >= 21 cm(3), VBED1066 >= 24 cm(3), and DmeanBED10 cHBT >=14 Gy were consistently predictive of grade 3+ toxicity on multivariate analysis., CONCLUSIONS: VBED1072, VBED1066, and DmeanBED10 to cHBT are associated with HB toxicity. We suggest VBED1072 < 21 cm(3) (5-fraction: V40 < 21 cm(3); 3-fraction: V33.8 < 21 cm(3)), VBED1066 < 24 cm(3) (5-fraction: V37.7 < 24 cm(3); 3-fraction: V32 < 24 cm(3)) as potential dose constraints for the cHBT when clinically indicated.

3178,"Is the modified Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability useful for assessing dysphagia in patients with mild to moderate dementia?. Dysphagia is an important causative factor of aspiration pneumonia among the elderly, particularly in patients with dementia. The modified Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (mMASA) is commonly used as a physician-administered screening protocol for assessing dysphagia due to its merits as a clinical test that does not involve special equipment or radiation exposure. The present study investigated whether the mMASA would reflect the dysphagia state as estimated by videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) findings and cognitive function in patients with dementia. This study included 25 subjects with mild to moderate dementia. In all subjects, swallowing function was evaluated with the mMASA and VFSS and cognitive function was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scales. The Spearman correlation and linear regression tests were conducted with the mMASA values and other tests for swallowing and cognition. The mMASA values were correlated with the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) of the VFSS as well as scores on the MMSE, MoCA, GDS, and CDR. In addition, the Judgment and Problem Solving and Community Affairs subscales of the CDR were correlated with mMASA values. The assessments of dysphagia using the mMASA were consistent with the VFSS findings and were reflected by cognitive function. Taken together, the present findings suggest that the mMASA would be useful for the routine evaluation of swallowing function in patients with mild to moderate dementia for the detection of dysphagia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded,0.038577154

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate visualization of the right adrenal vein (RAV) with multidetector CT and non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging in patients with primary aldosteronism., METHODS: A total of 125 patients (67 men) scheduled for adrenal venous sampling (AVS) were included. Dynamic 64-detector-row CT and balanced steady-state free precession-based non-contrast-enhanced 3-T MR imaging were performed. RAV visualization based on a four-point score was documented. Both anatomical location and variation on cross-sectional imaging were evaluated, and the findings were compared with catheter venography as the gold standard., RESULTS: The RAV was visualized in 93.2% by CT and 84.8% by MR imaging (p = 0.02). Positive predictive values of RAV visualization were 100% for CT and 95.2% for MR imaging. Imaging score was significantly higher in CT than MR imaging (p < 0.01). The RAV formed a common trunk with an accessory hepatic vein in 16% of patients. The RAV orifice level on cross-sectional imaging was concordant with catheter venography within the range of 1/3 vertebral height in >70% of subjects. Success rate of AVS was 99.2%., CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic CT is a reliable way to map the RAV prior to AVS. Non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging is an alternative when there is a risk of complication from contrast media or radiation exposure., KEY POINTS: Dynamic CT and non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging detect the right adrenal vein (RAV). Dynamic CT can visualize the RAV more than non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging. Mapping the RAV helps to achieve successful adrenal venous sampling.

3180,"Individualized protocol for radiation and contrast medium dose reduction in one-stop assessment for kidney transplantation patients. Objective: To compare image quality, radiation, and contrast medium (CM) doses between individualized and conventional scan protocols in combined coronary CT angiography (CCTA) and iliac artery CTA for kidney transplantation patients. Method(s): 148 patients needing assessment for coronary and iliac arteries before kidney transplantation were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided into the conventional and individualized groups. All patients underwent one-stop combined scans on a 256-row CT scanner with automatic tube current modulation, 50 % pre-ASIR-V to control radiation dose. CCTA was performed first using one heartbeat axial scan mode with bolus tracking technique and iliac CTA was performed 3 s after CCTA using a spiral scan. The conventional group (n = 72) used the standard protocol: 100 kVp, 60 mL of 350 mgI/mL CM at 4.5 mL/s flow rate. The individualized group (n = 76) used a body-mass-index (BMI)-dependent protocol: kVp: 80 (BMI < 24) and 100 (BMI >= 24) and CM: 19 mgI/kg (BMI < 18); 21 mgI/kg (18 <= BMI < 24); and 22 mgI/kg (BMI >= 24). Image quality radiation and CM doses of the two groups were compared. Result(s): There was no significant difference in patient demographic data. Compared with the conventional group, the individualized group reduced contrast flow rate (in mL/s) by 14.4 % (3.85 +/- 0.72 vs. 4.5), contrast dose (in mL) by 35.8 % (38.53 +/- 7.18 vs. 60) and radiation dose (in mSv) by 34.3 % (4.30 +/- 1.73 vs. 6.54 +/- 1.45). The individualized group had significantly higher subjective image quality score (P < 0.05), lower noise (17.30 +/- 4.97 HU vs. 19.13 +/- 4.73 HU, P = 0.02) and higher signal-to-noise ratio (22.09 +/- 7.41 vs. 19.55 +/- 6.18, P = 0.03) for the three main vessels in CCTA compared with the conventional group. There were no differences in both subjective scores and objective measurements in iliac artery CTA between the two groups. Conclusion(s): The individualized scanning protocol in the one-stop assessment of coronary and iliac arteries before kidney transplantation significantly reduces both radiation and CM doses while maintaining image quality in iliac artery CTA and providing better coronary artery images in CCTA.Copyright © 2021",Excluded,0.038474005
3181,"Radiosurgery Ablation of Medial Branch Nerves of the Lumbar Spine for Facetogenic Back Pain: A Dosimetric Evaluation of Targeting and Safety. Purpose/Objective(s): Low back pain is a common problem across the population and is often multifactorial in etiology. Pain may originate from the facet in 15-40% of cases. Invasive nerve ablation techniques with interventional radiology (IR) targeting the medial branches of the primary dorsal ramus can be effective tools for pain alleviation, though the response may not be durable. Ablative therapies such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and stereotactic ablative radiosurgery (SABR) can be used for nerve ablation in settings such as trigeminal neuralgia. Robotic arm radiosurgery facet rhizotomy has been tested in a pilot series of patients with safe results. We hypothesize that LINAC-based SABR may be a non-invasive option for delivering ablative radiation dose to the medial branch nerves of the lumbar spine, with the goal of prolonged pain control while maintaining low doses to surrounding organs at risk (OARs). Materials/Methods: Anonymized CT images of the lumbosacral spine were obtained from 5 patients immobilized and scanned at our facility with 1.25mm slice thickness and treated for issues unrelated to back pain. With the assistance of an interventional radiologist who regularly performs medial branch nerve blocks and RFA, the branch nerves were contoured for the L2 and L3 levels bilaterally. Four non-coplanar dynamic conformal arcs were used to target the nerves, with both nerves as PTV. We attempted to spare the motor nerve roots and other OARs. In addition, we ran an eight-beam IMRT comparison plan targeting the L2 to L3 facet with a 1mm expansion as PTV. Single fraction SABR was planned with 50Gy dose to the isocenter for each treatment plan. The PTV dose coverage and dose to the OARs were tabulated and compared. Result(s): The following table shows the relevant treatment volumes and OAR doses. We avoided excessive doses to the surrounding structures in the plans for all 5 patients bilaterally. Coverage was acceptable with an average of 45 Gy covering the 90% IDL. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates the feasibility of delivering ablative doses of SABR to the medial branch nerves of the lumbar spine below the level of the cord. OARs received acceptable doses, with lower values obtained from the plans with targeted radiation to the nerves when compared with plans involving radiation to the entire facet. PTV coverage was not compromised. Though efficacy would require in vivo testing, with accurate targeting and the assistance of IR in selecting appropriate patients, SABR may provide a noninvasive, reasonable, and effective treatment option for facetogenic low back pain.

3182,"Downregulation of MicroRNA-330 Correlates with the Radiation Sensitivity and Prognosis of Patients with Brain Metastasis from Lung Cancer. BACKGROUND: The present study sought to explore the role of microRNA-330 (miR-330) in predicting the radiation response and prognosis of patients with brain metastasis (BM) from lung cancer (LC)., METHODS: Patients with BM from LC were identified and classified into radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant groups according to the overall survival rate, local and distant recurrence rate after conventional whole-brain radiation therapy. Quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect miR-330 expression in serum. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the prognostic value of miR-330 for the radiation sensitivity of brain metastasis from LC. Related clinical factors for radiation sensitivity were assessed by logistic regression analysis, and a survival analysis was conducted using COX regression and the Kaplan-Meier method., RESULTS: MiR-330 exhibited lower expression in the radiation-sensitive group than in the radiation-resistant group. The area under the ROC curve of miR-330 for predicting radiation sensitivity was 0.898 (optimal cut-off value, 0.815), with a sensitivity of 71.7% and a specificity of 90.1%. After radiation therapy, patients with low miR-330 expression, compared to patients with high miR-330 expression, displayed a lower survival rate and a median survival time. MiR-330 expression was correlated with extracranial metastasis, maximum BM diameter, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and node (N) stage. Logistic regression and COX regression analyses revealed that extracranial metastasis, TNM stage, N stage and miR-330 expression were factors that influenced both radiation sensitivity and individual prognostic factors in patients with BM from LC., CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the downregulation of miR-330 correlates with radiation sensitivity and poor prognosis in patients with BM from LC.

Background: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with gemcitabine (GEM) for pancreatic cancer at our institute achieved excellent cure rates, while treated patients encountered vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) frequently. Method(s): From January 2006 to December 2011, 220 patients (male/female: 134/86, median age: 66 (range: 33-84)) with resectable pancreatic cancer have been treated with preoperative CRT with GEM. This method consisted of concurrent radiotherapy (50-60 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) and chemotherapy (GEM 1,000 mg/m2intravenous, weekly for 12-15 weeks, 3 times during 4 weeks). Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was used and its fields covered both primary pancreatic tumor and retropancreatic tissues with 50 Gy level. Boost irradiation to the roots of celiac and superior mesenteric arteries with 2.4 Gy/fr using field-within-field technique has been started since 2009.

The structure and properties of FACS complex was characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, UV, SEM, TEM, DLS and XRD analyses. TEM and DLS results showed that FACS complex has nanostructure and the mean size of particles was unimodal with average diameters in the range of 165-252 nm. Radiolabeling of FACS complex (99mTc-FACS) was done with Technetium-99 m (99mTc). The optimum conditions of labeling were investigated. The labeling yield was 85% at pH = 6 and 30 min reaction time. The effect of time on the stability of 99mTc-FACS complex was studied and the results revealed that it is stable up to 6 h after labeling. Biodistribution studies of 99mTc-FACS complex in Quail showed that it distributed to different organs mainly in blood, liver and kidney. The results revealed that the uptake of 99mTc-FACS in the sexual organs (ovary and ovarian) of female Quail was higher than that in the sexual organs (testes) of male Quail, so 99mTc-FACS could be used to differentiate between them.

Diagnostic performance, procedure details, complication rate, and patient radiation exposure were investigated., RESULTS: The technical success rate of PNB under CBCT virtual navigation system was 100 % (100/100). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PNB of small nodules under iGuide CBCT virtual navigation guidance were 95.1 % (79/83), 100 % (12/12), and 95.7 % (91/95), respectively. The number of biopsies and CBCT acquisitions were 2.6 +/- 1.2 (range 1-6) and 3.0 +/- 1.1 (range 2-8), respectively. Complications occurred in five (5.0 %) cases. The mean total procedure time was 11.70 +/- 3.44 min (range 6-27 min), resulting in a mean exposure dose of 9.7 +/- 4.3 mSv., CONCLUSION: Flat detector cone-beam CT-guided PNB is an accurate and safe diagnostic method for mediastinal lesions.",Excluded,0.03871596
3187,"INTESTINE MICROBIOME ASPIRATION (IMBA) CAPSULE: A NEW AUTONOMOUS AND MINIMALLY-INVASIVE DEVICE FOR WHOLE GUT MICROBIOME SAMPLING AND MAPPING. BACKGROUND. Intestinal microbiota is closely related to human health. However, our current understandings about intestine microbiota are limited due to its inaccessibility. Invasive and expensive catheter-based sampling methods are not suitable for large-scale studies. So, a reliable, inexpensive and convenient capsule device to collect intestinal microbiome is demanded. Here, we report the Intestine Microbiome Aspiration (IMBA) which aims to collect intestine fluid sample autonomously. Without using expensive MEMS technologies, IMBA utilizes controlled-release technology equipped with an novel sampling mechanism to achieve precise and regional sampling in intestine. METHODS. Three healthy volunteers and three IBS-D volunteers ingested the IMBA capsule with distilled water in their empty stomach in the morning. As shown in Fig. 1, Each capsule has an outer hard gelatin shell with an small intestine (SI)-targeted coating (Eudragit L100-55) that kept the main capsule body intact in the acidic stomach. Once the outer shell dissolved in SI, the capsule body was exposed to the luminal environment, and intestinal fluid flowed into a compartment via four wide channels on the capsule wall. The compartment contained 50mg hydrophilic fibers to wick and retain the fluidic luminal sample. A piston was fixed by a dissolvable spring-loaded latch to keep the channels open initially. The latch gradually dissolved in its thickness until its structure collapsed to release the spring, which pushed the piston to close the channels and seal the samples. The subjects underwent a low-dose X-ray scan every 30 minutes after oral intake of the capsule to monitor the sampling status until the spring was released. Capsules and swabbed fecal samples were collected by the volunteer after their bowel movements in the following 1-2 days, and sent for 16s rRNA analysis. RESULTS. All six capsules completed sampling in the small intestine within 3 hours after oral intake. Each capsule collected 74mg of small intestine luminal contents on average. The microbiota composition was different not only between intestines and feces, but also between healthy volunteers and IBS-D volunteers. Intestinal samples were characterized by increased abundance of Gammaproteobacteria, Pseudomonadales and Proteobacteria and reduction of Peptostreptococcaceae and Janthinobacterium (Fig. 2). CONCLUSION. The IMBA prototype has proven the concept of ""MEMS-free"" intestine-targeted microbiome sampling technology, a critical step towards personalized whole gut microbiota mapping. The technology offers a safe and reliable solution of capsule-based GI contents sampling while significantly reducing the costs per operation. New designs of large-scale human studies become possible to reveal temporal and spatial variation of gut microbiota for better understanding of its roles in various diseases.

3188,"Clinical Research and Technique Note of TLIF by Wiltse Approach for the Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar. Objective: To assess the clinical efficacy and share the technique notes of Wiltse Approach TLIF for the treating single segment degenerative lumbar spinal disease. Method(s): In this retrospective controlled study, 780 patients with single segment degenerative lumbar disease who were operated in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were randomly assigned to Wiltse approach group (group A, 410 cases) and conventional open approach group (group B, 370 cases). Patient's assessment of pain and disability were evaluated by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) before and after surgery. The incision length, operative time, exposure time, intraoperative blood loss, hidden blood loss, time to ambulation, total length of hospitalization, serum creatine kinase, X-rays, CT and MRI were also evaluated. Result(s): There were no differences in sex, age, pre-operative ODI score, VAS score between the two groups (P > 0.05). The Wiltse approach group had a shorter incision length with 7.69 +/- 0.44 cm compared to the conventional group with 11.13 +/- 0.36 cm (P < 0.01). The average operative time was 119.20 +/- 14.64 min with exposure time of 16.20 +/- 3.42 min in the Wiltse approach group and 145.65 +/- 16.98 min with 29.20 +/- 3.42 min in the conventional group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Comparing the intraoperative blood loss, hidden blood loss, serum creatine kinase, time to ambulation, total length of hospitalization, the Wiltse approach group was less than the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). The VAS score of the two groups decreased significantly with time, and the VAS score of the Wiltse group was significantly lower than that of the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). At last investigation after operation, ODI scores of the two groups were significantly decreased compared with that before operation. Wiltse approach group was significantly lower than that of the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). The multifidus of the two groups of patients had a certain degree of atrophy. But the Wiltse approach group multifidus muscle atrophy rate is significantly lower than the conventional open approach group. Conclusion(s): The Wiltse approach TLIF significantly reduces the damage to the paravertebral muscles and the postoperative incidence of chronic low back pain.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

3189,"Radiation therapy for intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. BACKGROUND: The intrahepatic recurrence rate after curative hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is high, and management of recurrence is thus important for long-term survival. The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC., METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy., RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence., CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients.",Excluded,0.8232512
3190,"Next-generation sequencing analysis of circulating micro-RNA expression in response to parabolic flight as a spaceflight analogue. Understanding physiologic reactions to weightlessness is an indispensable requirement for safe human space missions. This study aims to analyse changes in the expression of circulating miRNAs following exposure to gravitational changes. Eight healthy volunteers (age: 24.5 years, male: 4, female: 4) were included. Each subject underwent 31 short-term phases of weightlessness and hypergravity induced by parabolic flight as a spaceflight analogue. At baseline, 1 and 24 h after parabolic flight, venous blood was withdrawn. Analysis of circulating miRNAs in serum was conducted by means of next generation sequencing. In total, 213 miRNAs were robustly detected (TPM > 5) by small RNA sequencing in all 24 samples. Four miRNAs evidenced a significant change in expression after adjusting for multiple testing. Only miR-223-3p showed a consistent significant decrease 24 h after parabolic flight compared to baseline values and values at 1 h after parabolic flight. miR-941 and miR-24-3p showed a significant decrease 24 h after parabolic flight compared to 1 h after parabolic flight but not to baseline values. miR-486-5p showed a significant increase 24 h after parabolic flight compared to 1 h after parabolic flight but not to baseline values. A target network analysis identified genes of the p53 signaling pathway and the cell cycle highly enriched among the targets of the four microRNAs. Our findings suggest cellular adaption to gravitational changes at the post-transcriptional level. Based on our results, we suggest a change in cell cycle regulation as potential explanation for adaptational changes observed in space missions. 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.041458055
3191,"The thermal effects of therapeutic lasers with 810 and 904 nm wavelengths on human skin. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of therapeutic infrared class 3B laser irradiation on skin temperature in healthy participants of differing skin color, age, and gender., BACKGROUND: Little is known about the potential thermal effects of Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) irradiation on human skin., METHODS: Skin temperature was measured in 40 healthy volunteers with a thermographic camera at laser irradiated and control (non-irradiated) areas on the skin. Six irradiation doses (2-12 J) were delivered from a 200 mW, 810 nm laser and a 60 mW, 904 nm laser, respectively., RESULTS: Thermal effects of therapeutic LLLT using doses recommended in the World Association for Laser Therapy (WALT) guidelines were insignificant; below 1.5degreeC in light, medium, and dark skin. When higher irradiation doses were used, the 60 mW, 904 nm laser produced significantly (p < 0.01) higher temperatures in dark skin (5.7, SD +/- 1.8degreeC at 12 J) than in light skin, although no participants requested termination of LLLT. However, irradiation with a 200 mW, 810 nm laser induced three to six times more heat in dark skin than in the other skin color groups. Eight of 13 participants with dark skin asked for LLLT to be stopped because of uncomfortable heating. The maximal increase in skin temperature was 22.3degreeC., CONCLUSIONS: The thermal effects of LLLT at doses recommended by WALT-guidelines for musculoskeletal and inflammatory conditions are negligible (<1.5degreeC) in light, medium, and dark skin. However, higher LLLT doses delivered with a strong 3B laser (200 mW) are capable of increasing skin temperature significantly and these photothermal effects may exceed the thermal pain threshold for humans with dark skin color.",Excluded,0.6423177
3192,"Exposure to electromagnetic fields and risk of central nervous system disease in utility workers. Occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields has been associated with neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, senile dementia, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease. I studied the incidence of central nervous system diseases in 30,631 persons employed in Danish utility companies between 1900 and 1993. I linked the cohort to the nationwide, population-based Danish National Register of Patients and compared the numbers of cases of these diseases observed between 1978 and 1993 with the corresponding rates in the general population. In addition I fit to the data on utility workers a multiplicative Poisson regression model in relation to estimated levels of exposure to 50-Hz electromagnetic fields. Overall, there was an increase in risk for senile dementia and motor neuron diseases combined. The incidences of Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and other diseases of the central nervous system were essentially unrelated to exposure to electromagnetic fields. A decreased risk of epilepsy compared with the general population probably reflects a healthy worker effect; I observed an increased risk of epilepsy based on internal comparisons. The increased risk for senile dementia and motorneuron diseases may be associated with above-average levels of exposure to electromagnetic fields.",Excluded,0.94262487

3194,"Myocardial perfusion imaging with a cadmium zinc telluride-based gamma camera versus invasive fractional flow reserve. Purpose: Recently introduced ultrafast cardiac SPECT cameras with cadmium zinc telluride-based (CZT) detectors may provide superior image quality allowing faster acquisition with reduced radiation doses. Although the level of concordance between conventional SPECT and invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement has been studied, that between FFR and CZT-based SPECT is not yet known. Therefore, we aimed to assess the level of concordance between CZT SPECT and FFR in a large patient group with stable coronary artery disease. Method(s): Both invasive FFR and myocardial perfusion imaging with a CZT-based SPECT camera, using Tc-tetrofosmin as tracer, were performed in 100 patients with stable angina and intermediate grade stenosis on invasive coronary angiography. A cut-off value of <0.75 was used to define abnormal FFR. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 64+/-11 years, and 64 % were men. SPECT demonstrated ischaemia in 31 % of the patients, and 20 % had FFR <0.75. The concordance between CZT SPECT and FFR was 73 % on a per-patient basis and 79 % on a per-vessel basis. Discordant findings were more often seen in older patients and were mainly (19 %) the result of ischaemic SPECT findings in patients with FFR >=0.75, whereas only 8 % had an abnormal FFR without ischaemia as demonstrated by CZT SPECT. Conclusion(s): Only 20 - 30 % of patients with intermediate coronary stenoses had significant ischaemia as assessed by CZT SPECT or invasive FFR. CZT SPECT showed a modest degree of concordance with FFR, which is comparable with previous results with conventional SPECT. Further investigations are particularly necessary in patients with normal SPECT and abnormal FFR, especially to determine whether these patients should undergo revascularization. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded,0.03831373
3195,"Flow cytometry-based assay for determination of teleost cytotoxic cell lysis of target cells. BACKGROUND: The nonradiometric assays previously developed to detect cellular cytotoxic activity have been hindered by many difficulties. Among the problems are the requirement for expensive commercial kits and the use of techniques that produce high background noise and decreased sensitivity. In addition, these assays did not account for bidirectional apoptosis (activation-induced cell death [AICD]). Most attempts to derive cytometry-based cytotoxicity assays have been unsuccessful because individual effectors and targets could not be identified (i.e., ""separated"") using gating techniques., METHODS: In the present study, teleost nonspecific cytotoxic (NCC) and mammalian target cells were each sufficiently different in size to identify them by flow cytometry (FCM). Using appropriate gating and discriminator techniques, these two cell populations were differentiated based on scatter properties and propidium iodide (PI) binding. Total capacity for PI binding was obtained by permeabilization of the targets with ice-cold acetone. Spontaneous PI binding was relatively low. This technique detected cytotoxicity at effector-to-target ratios (E:T) of 1:1 and after only 30 min cocultivation., RESULTS: Tilapia NCC from peripheral blood kill human transformed target cells by necrosis and apoptosis as identified by PI binding. Maximum killing of HL-60 targets (approximately 100%) occurred by 180 min cocultivation. For the same time, the killing of IM-9 did not exceed 60%. Almost 90% of IM-9 targets are lysed following 14 h of cocultivation. The maximum killing of both HL-60 and IM-9 targets was observed at a 25:1 E:T ratio after 14 h. Comparisons of the chromium(>51) release assay with flow detection of cytotoxicity revealed that FCM detected 55% lysis of the target cells compared with 2% cytotoxicity by chromium release, after a cocultivation time of 240 min., DISCUSSION: FCM detection of (teleost) NCC lysis of target cells using PI uptake is more sensitive than standard chromium release assays. This level of sensitivity was observed because NCC and targets were sufficiently different in size such that they could be resolved by scatter plots. Using FCM, cytotoxicity was detected earlier and at lower E:T ratios than previously reported for chromium release assays. Although tilapia were reported previously to be not capable of lysing IM-9 targets by chromium release detection, the more sensitive method of FCM detected cytotoxicity using PI uptake. HL-60 lysis by tilapia NCC exhibited saturable kinetics but occurred at different times post-cocultivation. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded,0.039022103
3196,"Male breast cancer: risk factors, diagnosis, and management (Review). Male breast cancer (MBC) is extremely rare, with an incidence in the general US population of <1%. It tends to be diagnosed at later stages than breast cancer in females, likely because of low awareness on the part of the patient and low suspicion by the physician. Risk factors include genetic predisposition, alterations to the estrogen-testosterone ratio, radiation exposure, and occupational hazards. Because of the rarity of MBC, mammography in men is more often utilized as a diagnostic tool to evaluate breast symptoms rather than as a tool for widespread screening. While clinical breast examinations are effective at evaluating breast symptoms, mammography also may be beneficial in separating malignant from benign breast disease. This study reviews MBC and its risk factors, recommendations for screening and diagnosis, the roles of mammography and genetic testing in surveillance, and management of patients with MBC. Heightened awareness of the increased risk in certain men by both physicians and patients, and adherence to guidelines recommended for the surveillance of men at increased risk, may result in earlier detection.",Excluded,0.03917621

Experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that veto cells are responsible for the prolonged survival of minor allografts of skin that is observed in recipients primed intravenously with spleen cells from mice syngeneic with the skin donors. This prolonged survival was observed for each of several minor histocompatibility (H) antigens and is antigen-specific. Gamma radiation (3300 rads) abolished the ability of male spleen cells infused i.v. to delay the rejection of male skin grafts (H-Y antigen) on female recipients. However, depletion of Thy-1+ cells from the i.v. infusion failed to abolish the ability to prolong male skin graft survival. Furthermore, the prolonged survival accorded to B6 (H-2b) male skin grafts on CB6F1 (H-2b/H-2d) female recipients given i.v. infusions of B6 male spleen cells extended to BALB/c (H-2d) male skin grafts as well, indicating a lack of MHC restriction. Thus, prolongation of minor allograft survival by i.v. infusion of minor H antigen-bearing spleen cells appears not to depend on veto T cells that others have found to be responsible for the suppression of CTL generation (2, 3, 5).",Excluded,0.11158053

3201,"Investigating the SPECT Dose-Function Metrics Associated With Radiation-Induced Lung Toxicity Risk in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy. Purpose: Dose to normal lung has commonly been linked with radiation-induced lung toxicity (RILT) risk, but incorporating functional lung metrics in treatment planning may help further optimize dose delivery and reduce RILT incidence. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the dose delivered to functional lung regions by analyzing perfusion (Q), ventilation (V), and combined V/Q single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) dose-function metrics with regard to RILT risk in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received radiation therapy (RT). Methods and Materials: SPECT images acquired from 88 patients with locally advanced NSCLC before undergoing conventionally fractionated RT were retrospectively analyzed. Dose was converted to the nominal dose equivalent per 2 Gy fraction, and SPECT intensities were normalized. Regional lung segments were defined, and the average dose delivered to each lung region was quantified. Three functional categorizations were defined to represent low-, normal-, and high-functioning lungs. The percent of functional lung category receiving >=20 Gy and mean functional intensity receiving >=20 Gy (iV20) were calculated. RILT was defined as grade 2+ radiation pneumonitis and/or clinical radiation fibrosis. A logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between dose-function metrics and risk of RILT. Result(s): By analyzing V/Q normalized intensities and functional distributions across the population, a wide range in functional capability (especially in the ipsilateral lung) was observed in patients with NSCLC before RT. Through multivariable regression models, global lung average dose to the lower lung was found to be significantly associated with RILT, and Q and V iV20 were correlated with RILT when using ipsilateral lung metrics. Through a receiver operating characteristic analysis, combined V/Q low-function receiving >=20 Gy (low-functioning V/Q20) in the ipsilateral lung was found to be the best predictor (area under the curce: 0.79) of RILT risk. Conclusion(s): Irradiation of the inferior lung appears to be a locational sensitivity for RILT risk. The multivariable correlation between ipsilateral lung iV20 and RILT, as well as the association of low-functioning V/Q20 and RILT, suggest that irradiating low-functioning regions in the lung may lead to higher toxicity rates.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Excluded,0.567661

The effect of sublethal whole-body irradiation (500 rad) on the resistance of C57BL/6 mice to infection with Toxoplasma gondii was studied. Mice irradiated 1 day before or 4 days after infection via the intraperitoneal or peroral route with cysts of the mildly virulent ME49 strain of T. gondii died sooner than did unirradiated controls. The time to death of irradiated mice was suggestive of impaired acquired immunity. Irradiated mice infected intraperitoneally with T. gondii cysts exhibited reduced levels of Thy-1+CD4-CD8- cells, less natural killer cell activity against YAC-1 targets, and lower levels of IFN-gamma than controls. Numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells were also lower in infected, irradiated mice. Irradiated mice immunized with a vaccine strain of T. gondii, and later challenged with a highly virulent strain, were less well protected than unirradiated controls.

In first group as the control group no intervention was made. Dentures of the second group merely exposed to laser irradiation by the diode laser with wavelength of 940 nm with 100mW for 30 seconds on mucosal surface of dentures before delivery. Samples were collected from the mucosal surface of upper dentures on the determined days. All collected colonies were counted. Clinical outcome was evaluated regarding the colonization of Candida albicans reported by CFU. Difference of colony counts results between two groups was evaluated by Mann-Whitney test. Statistical significance was assumed if p<0.05. Result(s): The results showed laser irradiation was significantly effective in reducing candida colonization. The lower density of the colonies was seen in laser group in compare with control group on 15th and 60th days after denture delivery (P=0.002) & (P=0.003), respectively.

Human radiation burden was estimated to evaluate potential for future use as clinical PET tracers for imaging of neo-angiogenesis. Method(s): A 68Ge/68Ga generator was used for the synthesis of 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2. 68Ga and 64Cu labeled NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 tracers were administrated in nude mice bearing either human glioblastoma (U87MG) or human neuroendocrine (H727) xenograft tumors. PET/CT scans at 3 time points were used for calculating the tracer uptake in tumors (%ID/g), integrin alphaVbeta3 target specificity was shown by blocking with cold NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2, and biodistribution in normal organs were also examined. From biodistribution data in mice human radiation-absorbed doses were estimated using OLINDA/EXM software. Result(s): 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 was synthesized with a radiochemical purity of 89%-99% and a specific activity (SA) of 16-153MBq/nmol. 64Cu-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 had a purity of 92%-99% and an SA of 64-78MBq/nmol.Both tracers showed similar uptake in xenograft tumors 1. h after injection (U87MG: 2.23 vs. 2.31%ID/g; H727: 1.53 vs. 1.48%ID/g). Both RGD dimers showed similar tracer uptake in non-tumoral tissues and a human radiation burden of less than 10. mSv with an administered dose of 200. MBq was estimated. Conclusion(s): 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 and 64Cu-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 can be easily synthesized and are both promising candidates for PET imaging of integrin alphaVbeta3 positive tumor cells. 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 showed slightly more stable tumor retention.

Method(s): The donations of femoral heads to the Queensland Bone Bank over a 9-year period were reviewed, and the incidence and bacteriology of contamination were detailed. Clinical outcomes were determined for donors who had positive cultures at the time of retrieval and they were compared with those of culture-negative donors. Result(s): Between March 1987 and February 1996, 232 femoral heads were donated to the Queensland Bone Bank. Four specimens were sent for culture with each femoral head (surface swab of femoral head, acetabular swab, bone biopsy and capsule). In 51 cases, one or more positive cultures were obtained (22% contamination rate). The majority of organisms cultured were Staphylococcus epidermidis. One hundred and seventy donations came from surgery performed at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, and 40 femoral heads were considered contaminated. Deep infection was recorded in one of the 40 cases with contaminated donations and three out of 130 non-contaminated donations had subsequent septic episodes. Conclusion(s): The contamination rate detailed in the present report is higher than in most series. This may be due to the fact that four bacteriological specimens are taken to assess contamination. Two of these specimens are tissue samples which yielded more positive results than did the two swabs. All other series take no more than two bacteriological specimens, which are usually bone swabs. These are shown to have a poor yield of positive cultures. Therefore there is a significant underestimation of contamination rates by other bone banks. This has implications for the recipients of bone from those banks, particularly when the allograft material is not secondarily sterilized. This is important given increasing allograft usage, and the increasing numbers of revision joint arthroplasty and impaction grafting procedures being performed.

At least six cycles of chemotherapy were planned, with up to eight for patients showing slower response. Involved-field RT was recommended for incomplete response to chemotherapy or bulk disease at presentation. The primary outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), landmarked from the end of chemotherapy., RESULTS: Among 807 patients randomly assigned, 702 achieved objective response. Postchemotherapy RT for consolidation was reported in 300 (43%). With median follow-up of 6.9 years, 161 PFS events and 83 deaths were reported. Baseline characteristics showed more patients with bulk disease having RT (190 [63%] v 111 [28%]) and only partial response after chemotherapy (150 [50%] v 36 [9%]). Other baseline characteristics were similar. PFS was superior for patients having RT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.60) with 5-year PFS 71% without RT, 86% with RT. A similar advantage was seen for overall survival (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.77). There was no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect across subgroups., CONCLUSION: Patients who received consolidation RT apparently had better outcomes, consistently across all prognostic groups which persisted in multivariate analysis. This suggests that RT contributes significantly to the cure rate for advanced HL, although patient selection for combined modality treatment requires better definition in prospective trials.",Excluded,0.043244325

There are many IPL systems that have different setting. Some of them have been reported in the treatment of fresh or laser-resistant port-wine stains localized in different body regions., OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to conduct a prospective trial to assess the effectiveness of Lynton (The Lumina Family of Medical Flashlamp Systems) of the IPL family in the treatment of fresh facial port-wine stains., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve patients with facial and/or neck port-wine stains without previous treatment were enrolled in the trial. Patient demographics, treatment setting, outcome of clearing, and treatment complications were noted., RESULTS: The treatment intervals were 4 to 6 weeks for three to six treatment sessions. Moderate improvement (50-75%) was achieved in 47% of the patients. Complete clearing was seen in only one patient (8.3%) after four treatment sessions. Hypertrophic scar formation in two patients occurred after healing blister. Except for the side effects, long-term complications were not seen., CONCLUSION: Moderate effectiveness was achieved with IPL treatment in the facial port-wine stains.",Excluded,0.03830855
3211,"Mitigation of hematologic radiation toxicity in mice through pharmacological quiescence induced by CDK4/6 inhibition. Total body irradiation (TBI) can induce lethal myelosuppression, due to the sensitivity of proliferating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) to ionizing radiation (IR). No effective therapy exists to mitigate the hematologic toxicities of TBI. Here, using selective and structurally distinct small molecule inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK6, we have demonstrated that selective cellular quiescence increases radioresistance of human cell lines in vitro and mice in vivo. Cell lines dependent on CDK4/6 were resistant to IR and other DNA-damaging agents when treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors. In contrast, CDK4/6 inhibitors did not protect cell lines that proliferated independently of CDK4/6 activity. Treatment of wild-type mice with CDK4/6 inhibitors induced reversible pharmacological quiescence (PQ) of early HSPCs but not most other cycling cells in the bone marrow or other tissues. Selective PQ of HSPCs decreased the hematopoietic toxicity of TBI, even when the CDK4/6 inhibitor was administered several hours after TBI. Moreover, PQ at the time of administration of therapeutic IR to mice harboring autochthonous cancers reduced treatment toxicity without compromising the therapeutic tumor response. These results demonstrate an effective method to mitigate the hematopoietic toxicity of IR in mammals, which may be potentially useful after radiological disaster or as an adjuvant to anticancer therapy.",Excluded,0.96139956
3212,"The role of 18F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography in detecting carcinoma of unknown primary. Objective: The aim of this analysis to describe the value of PET/CT in detecting primary site of malignancy in our patient population with histologically proven metastasis or with a high clinical suspicion of malignancy. Method(s): A total of 52 patients (24 male, 28 female; mean age: 55.1+/-14.3; age range: 21-82 years) who had PET/CT in our department due to histologically proven metastasis or had a high clinical suspicion for malignancy were included in the study. The results of 18F-FDG PET/CT and clinical follow-up data were reviewed retrospectively. Histologically analysis and/or clinical follow-up data were accepted gold standard in the confirmation 18F-FDG PET/CT results. Patients were evaluated in two groups as 29 patients with histologically proven metastasis (group 1) and 23 patients with clinical suspicion of malignancy (group 2). Result(s): Primary site of malignancy was discovered in 16 of 52 patients (30.7%) histologically. Twelve of 16 patients (75%) was in group 1 and 4 patients was in group 2. In the remaining patients (36/52; 69.3%) primary tumor sites were not found by PET/CT. The findings for group 1 and 2 were TN in 15 and 18 patients, respectively. In 3 patients, 18F-FDG PET/CT findings were discordant with gold standard and all of them had FP findings. Primary tumor site could not be determined in none of patients with negative PET/CT. Regarding the whole patient population, a sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET/CT for detecting primary site were calculated 100% and 91% respectively. Regarding the patients groups, the sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET/CT for group 1 and group 2 were calculated 100% and 88%; 100% and 94% respectively. Conclusion(s): In this retrospective analysis we concluded that PET/CT is a useful imaging method in detecting primary site of tumor in patients with histopathologically proven metastasis. Also it can be used in exclusion of malignancy in patients have strong clinical suspicion of malignancy.",Excluded,0.038249508
3213,"The roles of Bcl-xL in modulating apoptosis during development of Xenopus laevis. BACKGROUND: Apoptosis is a common and essential aspect of development. It is particularly prevalent in the central nervous system and during remodelling processes such as formation of the digits and in amphibian metamorphosis. Apoptosis, which is dependent upon a balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, also enables the embryo to rid itself of cells damaged by gamma irradiation. In this study, the roles of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-xL in protecting cells from apoptosis were examined in Xenopus laevis embryos using transgenesis to overexpress the XR11 gene, which encodes Bcl-xL. The effects on developmental, thyroid hormone-induced and gamma-radiation-induced apoptosis in embryos were examined in these transgenic animals., RESULTS: Apoptosis was abrogated in XR11 transgenic embryos. However, the transgene did not prevent the apoptotic response of tadpoles to thyroid hormone during metamorphosis. Post-metamorphic XR11 frogs were reared to sexual maturity, thus allowing us to produce second-generation embryos and enabling us to distinguish between the maternal and zygotic contributions of Bcl-xL to the gamma-radiation apoptotic response. Wild-type embryos irradiated before the mid-blastula transition (MBT) underwent normal cell division until reaching the MBT, after which they underwent massive, catastrophic apoptosis. Over-expression of Bcl-xL derived from XR11 females, but not males, provided partial protection from apoptosis. Maternal expression of XR11 was also sufficient to abrogate apoptosis triggered by post-MBT gamma-radiation. Tolerance to post-MBT gamma-radiation from zygotically-derived XR11 was acquired gradually after the MBT in spite of abundant XR11 protein synthesis., CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Bcl-xL is an effective counterbalance to proapoptotic factors during embryonic development but has no apparent effect on the thyroid hormone-induced apoptosis that occurs during metamorphosis. Furthermore, post-MBT apoptosis triggered by irradiation before the MBT could only be restrained by maternal expression of Bcl-xL. Although maternal expression of XR11 was sufficient to abrogate apoptosis triggered by post-MBT gamma-radiation, radiation tolerance from zygotically-derived XR11 was acquired gradually, indicating that synthesis of XR11 protein is not sufficient to prevent apoptosis. Thus, repression of radiation-induced apoptosis by overexpression of Bcl-xL during embryonic development depends upon the timing of its expression and post-translational events that enable the protein to become effective.",Excluded,0.96997213
3214,"Results of hypofractionated whole brain radiotherapy (2x8 Gy) for patients with brain metastases from lung cancer. Purpose: To evaluate the clinical and radiologic response rates, toxicity and tolerability of 2x8 Gy whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in lung cancer patients with brain metastases (BM). Method(s): WBRT was delivered to 126 lung cancer patients with BM during 2002-2006. External beam RT was delivered with a fraction dose of 8 Gy on the same day of each consecutive week. Tumor and symptom response and toxicity were recorded at every follow-up. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) and the new Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) were used for analysis of overall survival (OS). Result(s): Twenty-three patients had small cell (SCLC) and 103 had non small cell lung cancer. Pretreatment median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 70 (range 20-90). Clinical response rates were as follows: complete 31%; good partial 30.2%; partial 21.4%; stable 7.9%; and progressive 5.6%. Median palliation and survival duration was 57 and 80 days, respectively. Two- and 6-month survival rates (SR) were 59.5% and 25.4%, respectively. According to recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) 6-month SR for groups 1, 2 and 3 were 61.5, 41.6 and 33.9%, respectively (p=0.002). Six-month SR for the new Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) were: GPA 0-1, 7%; GPA 1.5-2.5, 34.2%; GPA 3, 25%; and GPA 3.5-4.0, 66.6% (p=0.0003). Conclusion(s): 2x8 Gy WBRT was found to be feasible. However, the late morbidity of this schedule is unknown so its use could be restricted to patients with poor performance status, with a short life expectancy and/or social problems, unlikely to tolerate more protracted radiotherapy regimens. © 2011 Zerbinis Medical Publications.",Excluded,0.03829593

3216,"Cardiac-CTand transoesophageal echocardiography comparison for left atrial appendage clots detection in patients referred for left atrial interventional procedures. Introduction: Left atrial appendage (LAA) was identified as a main location of clots formation (91% in non-valvular AF), and it is related with stroke and systemic embolic events. Presence of LAA clots is a contraindication to left atrial interventional procedures as pulmonary veins isolation or LAA percutaneous closure. Transoeophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the gold standard technique for exclude LAA clots, but other imaging modalities are emerging for this indication. Our aim was compare TEE and CT diagnostic performance for exclude LAA thrombus in patients referred for left atrium interventional procedure. Material(s) and Method(s): All patients studied with TEE (Philips EPIQ-7) and CT (Philips iCT-256) previous LAA percutaneous closure or pulmonary vein isolation procedures between May/2015 and May/2016 were included. LAA was studied with TTE in mid-esophageal views at 0degree, 45degree, 90degree, 135degree. LAA clot, spontaneous echo-contrast and low LAA velocities were assessed with TEE. CT was performed in two-phase scan (early arterial and venous phase with 70-90 sec delay), for detect filling defects in one or both phases. Result(s): 52 patients were included (67+/-15 years, 75% male). Main structural values were LV ejection fraction 57+/-11%, LA indexed volume 84 ml/m2, atrial fibrillation prevalence 46%. Procedure indication was 50% for LAA closure and 50% for pulmonary veins isolation. TEE detected 1.9% LAA clot (one patient), spontaneous echo-contrast 17,3% and low LAA velocities at 9.6%. Assessment with CT detected 1.9% LAA clot (1 case) and arterial defect at 17.3%. LAA clots cases are no coincident between both techniques (Pearson 0.02 p-value 0.889). Spontaneous echo-contrast was detected in 9 patients with TEE, 6 of them had arterial defect also at CT. On the other hand, arterial defect was detected at 9 with CT, 6 of them with spontaneous echo-contrast at TEE (Pearson 0.595 p-value <0.001). After comparison between indications there were differences in LAA defects prevalence. Previous LAA closure, TEE and CT detected thrombus at 3.8% (1 case) but are no coincident. TEE prevalence of spontaneous echo-contrast 30.8% and low flow velocity 19.2%; while with CT arterial defect 30.8% (Pearson 0.632 p-value 0-001). Previous pulmonary vein isolation TEE no detected any LAA defects and CT detected arterial defect but not at venous phase in one patient. Security data related with CT were 75 ml average of ionidated contrast (Visipaque 320mg), and a mean of radiation dose of 4.4 mSv. Conclusion(s): In our sample, LAA clots had a low prevalence. Both techniques detected a clot which it was no detected by the other modality. Instead, assessment of spontaneous echo-contrast or arterial defects had a moderate diagnostic correlation. A combined strategy with both techniques could improve the accuracy of LAA thrombus exclusion, especially in patients with LAA closure indication.",Excluded,0.038344387
3217,"Comparing outcomes of concurrent chemotherapy regimens in patients 65 years old or older with locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma. Background: The comparative efficacy of cisplatin (CDDP), carboplatin, and cetuximab (CTX) delivered concurrently with radiation for locally advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma continues to be evaluated. Method(s): The linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database was used to identify and compare patient and disease profiles, mortality, toxicity, and overall cost for patients with oropharynx cancer undergoing definitive concurrent chemoradiation with CDDP, carboplatin, or CTX between 2006 and 2011. The human papillomavirus status was unknown. The primary outcome was 2-year overall survival (OS). Result(s): Four hundred nine patients receiving concurrent CDDP (n = 167), carboplatin (n = 69), or CTX (n = 173) were included. Those who were older, those who were nonwhite, and those with a Charlson Comorbidity Index >= 2 were less likely to receive CDDP. Two-year OS was inferior with CTX (hazard ratio [HR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.60; P =.020) and no different with carboplatin (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.73-2.35; P =.362) in a Cox proportional hazards model (reference CDDP). There was no statistically significant difference between carboplatin and CTX (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.77-2.14; P =.891). Rates of antiemetic use and hospital visits for nausea/emesis/diarrhea or dehydration were statistically higher with CDDP. Pneumonia rates were higher with carboplatin. In the multivariate model, the corrected mean per-patient spending was significantly higher for CTX and carboplatin than CDDP ($61,133 and $65,721 vs $48,709). Conclusion(s): Patients who received CDDP had improved OS. CDDP was also associated with slightly lower overall costs and higher antiemetic usage and hospital visit rates, although a strong selection bias was observed because those receiving CTX and carboplatin were older and had higher comorbidity scores.Copyright © 2018 American Cancer Society",Excluded,0.03844128
3218,"Severity of radiation pneumonitis, from clinical, dosimetric and biological features: a pilot study. Background and objective: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) could be a lethal complication of lung cancer treatment. No reliable predictors of RP severity have been recognized. This prospective pilot study was performed to identify early predictors of high grade lung toxicity and to evaluate clinical, biological or dosimetric features associated with different grades of toxicity. Method(s): Sixteen patients with non-small cell lung cancer with indication of concurrent chemoradiotherapy using 60 Gy/2 Gy/fraction starting at cycle one of platinum based chemotherapy were included. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), pulmonary function testing (PFT), and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron-emission tomography was performed before radiotherapy (RT), after three weeks of treatment, and two months post-RT. For analysis, patients were grouped by grade (low [G1-G2] vs. high [G3-G5]). The two groups were compared to identify predictors of RP. Protein expression BAL and lung tissue metabolism was evaluated in two patients (RP-G1 vs. RP-G3). Categorical variables such as comorbidities, stages and locations were summarized as percentages. Radiation doses, pulmonary function values and time to RP were summarized by medians with ranges or as means with standard deviation. Longitudinal analysis PFT was performed by a T-test. Result(s): All 16 patients developed RP, as follows: G1 (5 pts; 31.3%); G2 (5 pts; 31.3%); G3 (5 pts; 31.3%); and G5 (1 pts; 6.1%). Patients with high grade RP presented significant decrease (p = 0.02) in diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) after three weeks of RT. No correlation between dosimetric values and RP grades was observed. BAL analysis of the selected patients showed that CXCL-1, CD154, IL-1ra, IL-23, MIF, PAI-1 and IFN-gamma were overexpressed in the lungs of the RP-G3 patient, even before treatment. The pre-RT SUVmax value in the RP-G3 patient was non-significantly higher than in the patient with RP-G1. Conclusion(s): RT induces some degree of RP. Our data suggest that decrease in DLCO% is the most sensitive parameter for the early detection of RP. Moreover, we detect biological differences between the two grades of pneumonitis, highlighting the potential value of some cytokines as a prognostic marker for developing high grade lung toxicity. Further multicenter studies with larger sample size are essential to validate these findings.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.03997671

The goal of the study was to characterize the changes in neurovegetative control of the circulation, attending the presumed physiological and psychological stress originated by the isolation and confinement typical of the living condition of space stations, as simulated in a ground based unit, using time and frequency domain analysis. As a secondary goal we sought to verify the implementation of real time data acquisition, for off line spectral analysis of R-R interval, systolic arterial pressure (by Finapres) and respiration (by PVF2 piezoelectric sensors). We addressed the cardiorespiratory and neurovegetative responses to standardized, simple stressors (active standing, dynamic and static handgrip) on the EXEMSI 92 crew, before, during and after the isolation period. On average the appropriate excitatory responses (to stand, dynamic and static handgrip) were elicited also in isolation and confinement. Active standing and small masses muscular exercises are easy to be performed in a confined and isolated environment and provide a valuable tool for investigating the adaptational changes in neural control mechanisms.

3221,"Increased occurrence of exfoliation in the male, Spanish American population of New Mexico. Exfoliation syndrome was found to occur much more frequently in the male Spanish American population of New Mexico. This was based on a Veterans Administration Medical Center study in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The prevalence of exfoliation in the Spanish Americans was estimated to be from 3-6 percent and this is consistent with many other such studies performed in the United States and other countries. The Spanish American population is 5.8 times more likely to develop exfoliation than the non-Spanish American population of New Mexico. Exfoliation was found on such eye structures as the lens, iris, ciliary processes, posterior capsule, vitreous face, posterior corneal surface, and arterial chamber angle. Glaucoma capsulare was also studied and it was found that there was not a significant difference between the Spanish American and the non-Spanish American population for developing the condition. However, there was a strong association of glaucoma with the presence of exfoliation in both groups. Based on our results, patients with exfoliation are 22 times more likely to develop glaucoma than are their age-matched controls. Also, 40 percent of the exfoliation patients had glaucoma compared with only 5 percent of the age-matched controls (p less than .001). The patients with glaucoma capsulare were found to have a more medically resistant type of glaucoma, which was consistent with other reports of this condition. There are two theories we propose for the existence of exfoliation in the Spanish American population of New Mexico. The first is a geographic climatic theory that relates exfoliation to greater solar radiation levels due to a high overall altitude and sunny weather in New Mexico.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded,0.06054653
3222,"Ultrasonic delivery of silica-gold nanoshells for photothermolysis of sebaceous glands in humans: Nanotechnology from the bench to clinic. Recent advances in nanotechnology have provided numerous opportunities to transform medical therapies for the treatment of diseases including cancer, atherosclerosis, and thrombosis. Here, we report, through in vitro studies and in vivo human pilot clinical studies, the use of inert, inorganic silica-gold nanoshells for the treatment of a widely prevalent and researched, yet poorly treated disease of acne. We use ~ 150 nm silica-gold nanoshells, tuned to absorb near-IR light and near-IR laser irradiation to thermally disrupt overactive sebaceous glands in the skin which define the etiology of acne-related problems. Low-frequency ultrasound was used to facilitate deep glandular penetration of the nanoshells. Upon delivery of the nanoshells into the follicles and glands, followed by wiping of superficial nanoshells from skin surface and exposure of skin to near-infrared laser, nanoshells localized in the follicles absorb light, get heated, and induce focal thermolysis of sebaceous glands. Pilot human clinical studies confirmed the efficacy of ultrasonically-delivered silica-gold nanoshells in inducing photothermal disruption of sebaceous glands without damaging collateral skin.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.041091103
3223,"Primary adenocarcinoma of the anus: A retrospective analysis. Purpose: To report the clinical features and outcome of patients with primary adenocarcinoma of the anus following radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Methods and Materials: A retrospective analysis was performed on 15 patients referred to Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute between 1981 to 1998 with primary adenocarcinoma of the anus. The median follow-up was 7.5 years. Six patients underwent treatment with curative intent - either chemoradiation or radiotherapy alone. Surgery was mainly limited to either incisional or excisional biopsy. The remaining nine patients were treated with palliative intent because of advanced age, advanced disease, or poor medical status. The biological equivalent doses were calculated for all patients and correlated with time to progression. Result(s): None of the curative group had relapsed after a median follow-up of 6.6 years. All except one were alive and well. No patient developed any serious long-term toxicity and all patients avoided colostomy. All patients managed with palliative intent died with persistent locoregional disease with a median survival of 0.8 year. Conclusion(s): Primary adenocarcinoma of the anus is a very rare disease that precludes a rigorous analysis. This study demonstrates that radiation and in particular chemoradiation are effective therapies consistent with other recent series and analogous to squamous cell carcinomas of the anus.

Objective: To understand the effects of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) evaluation on patients with previously untreated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with clinical evidence of regional lymph node involvement. Study Design: Prospective blinded study. Setting(s): Tertiary care cancer center. Subjects and Methods: Informed consent was obtained and data collected from 52 consecutive previously untreated patients with HNSCC and clinical evidence of cervical metastasis. All patients underwent conventional evaluation for HNSCC and whole body PET/CT. Data were evaluated by 5 independent reviewers, who performed TNM staging per the American Joint Committee on Cancer (seventh edition) manual and proposed a treatment plan prior to viewing, and after reviewing, PET/CT. Cases where at least 3 of 5 reviewers agreed were considered significant. Result(s): There were 0 patients for whom review of the PET/CT altered the T-class assessment (95% CI, 0-6.8), 12 (23.1%) for whom PET/CT altered N classification (95% CI, 12.5-34.5), and 2 (3.8%) for whom PET/CT altered the M classification (95% CI, 0.5-13.2). For 5 patients (9.6%), overall stage was altered per PET/CT review (95% CI, 3.2-21). For 3 patients (5.8%), PET/CT findings prompted reviewers to alter treatment recommendations (95% CI, 1.2-15.9). Conclusion(s): When added to more conventional patient evaluation, PET/CT results in changes to the TNM categories, but overall staging and treatment were less frequently affected. Whether PET/CT should be used routinely for patients with stage III and IV HNSCC is still subjective and merits further study.Copyright © American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2018.",Excluded,0.03847027

Background: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the commonest non-melanoma skin cancer among Caucasian and other light-skinned races. A rising trend in the occurrence of BCC has been observed globally. Data on occurrence of BCC in Indian population is lacking. Objective(s): To study the clinico-epidemiological and histopathological parameters of BCC in Indian patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective data analysis was done from the records of the patients with BCC examined in the dermatology department of a tertiary health care center over 16 years. Result(s): Among 105 premalignant and malignant skin lesions, 40 cases of BCC were recorded. Females were more common sufferers (F: M= 2.33:1). Four patients had genodermatoses (xerodema pigmentosum =3 and nevoid BCC syndrome=1). Most frequent age group was 61-70 years (n=11). Two non-syndromic patients were below 25 years of age. History of chronic sun exposure was present in all, either occupationally or related to daily activities. Four males were chronic alcoholic and 6 were smokers. Face was the commonest site involved (n=35), followed by scalp, post-auricular area and neck. Thirty six patients had single lesion and multiple lesions were present in 4 cases of genodermatoses. Commonest clinical diagnosis was pigmented BCC followed by nodular. Large morpheiform lesion was found in five. Histopathologically, all showed nests of basaloid cells with peripheral pallisading and retraction artifact. Eighteen specimens had melanin deposits; keratotic (2) and metatypical (1) patterns were observed. Chronic inflammatory infiltrate was present in sixteen.

Six patients had preoperative irradiation, and the rest had postoperative irradiation. The most common surgical procedures were partial glossectomy and neck dissection (17 patients) and wide excision of the primary and neck dissection (17 patients). The most common types of free tissue transfer were dorsalis pedis (13 patients) and scapular flaps (6 patients). The primary site was controlled in 22 patients (54%) and the neck in 36 patients (88%). Three patients (7.3%) had flap failure which required further surgical management. Eighteen patients are living with no evidence of disease with a median follow-up of 18 months (5-101 months), 10 patients are living with disease with a median follow-up of 9 months (3-40 months), 9 patients are dead of disease with a median survival of 13 months (6-54 months), and 4 patients are lost for follow-up.

3228,"Overwhelming support among urban Irish COPD patients for lung cancer screening by low-dose CT scan. PURPOSE: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) has renewed interest in low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening for lung cancer. Smokers may be less receptive toward LDCT screening, however, compared with never smokers. The views of patients with COPD, a particularly high-risk group, toward LDCT screening for lung cancer are currently unknown. We therefore evaluated attitudes of patients with COPD toward LDCT screening for lung cancer., METHODS: Interviews with Irish patients with COPD who satisfied NLST eligibility criteria were conducted in clinical settings using a questionnaire based on that of a comparable study of U.S. current/former smokers of unspecified disease status., RESULTS: A total of 142 subjects had a mean age of 65.09 +/- 6.07 years (46.4 % were male, mean pack years 54.5 +/- 33.3, mean FEV1 59.16 +/- 23 %); 97.8 % had an identifiable usual source of healthcare. Compared with data from a U.S. cohort of current/former smokers, a higher proportion of Irish COPD smokers: believed that they were at risk for lung cancer (63.6 vs. 15.7 %); believed that early detection improved chances of survival (90 vs. 51.2 ); were willing to consider LDCT screening (97.9 vs. 78.6 %); were willing to pay for a LDCT scan (68.6 vs. 36.2 %); and were willing to accept treatment recommendations arising (95.7 vs. 56.2 %; p < 0.0001 for all comparisons)., CONCLUSIONS: Urban Irish smokers with COPD who would be eligible for LDCT screening are almost universally in favor of being screened and treated for screening-detected lung cancers. This readily accessible high-risk population should be actively targeted in future screening programs.",Excluded,0.038737524
3229,"Main clinical, therapeutic and technical factors related to patient's maximum skin dose in interventional cardiology procedures. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to characterise the factors related to the X-ray dose delivered to the patient's skin during interventional cardiology procedures., METHODS: We studied 177 coronary angiographies (CAs) and/or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties (PTCAs) carried out in a French clinic on the same radiography table. The clinical and therapeutic characteristics, and the technical parameters of the procedures, were collected. The dose area product (DAP) and the maximum skin dose (MSD) were measured by an ionisation chamber (Diamentor; Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and radiosensitive film (Gafchromic; International Specialty Products Advanced Materials Group, Wayne, NJ). Multivariate analyses were used to assess the effects of the factors of interest on dose., RESULTS: The mean MSD and DAP were respectively 389 mGy and 65 Gy cm(-2) for CAs, and 916 mGy and 69 Gy cm(-2) for PTCAs. For 8% of the procedures, the MSD exceeded 2 Gy. Although a linear relationship between the MSD and the DAP was observed for CAs (r=0.93), a simple extrapolation of such a model to PTCAs would lead to an inadequate assessment of the risk, especially for the highest dose values. For PTCAs, the body mass index, the therapeutic complexity, the fluoroscopy time and the number of cine frames were independent explanatory factors of the MSD, whoever the practitioner was. Moreover, the effect of technical factors such as collimation, cinematography settings and X-ray tube orientations on the DAP was shown., CONCLUSION: Optimising the technical options for interventional procedures and training staff on radiation protection might notably reduce the dose and ultimately avoid patient skin lesions.",Excluded,0.040156756
3230,"Diagnostic Accuracy of Fluoroscopy, Radiography, and Computed Tomography in Detecting Cement Leakage in Kyphoplasty. Purpose Cement leakage is a typical complication of kyphoplasty for vertebral fractures. It is unclear if cement application intraoperatively can be improved by using other techniques of visualization and which kind of postoperative imaging should be recommended to detect cement extravasation accurately. Objective To compare the rates of cement leakage detected by intraoperative fluoroscopy, postoperative radiography, and postoperative computed tomography (CT) in a retrospective study. Patients and Methods The study included 78 patients (60 women and 18 men; 115 vertebral bodies) who were treated with two kinds of kyphoplasty. The patients underwent intraoperative fluoroscopy and postoperative radiography and CT. After surgery, the images were evaluated to compare cement leakage rates and locations in the three visualization techniques. Leakage locations were described as epidural, intradiskal, extravertebral, or intravascular. Results Compared with CT, intraoperative fluoroscopy regularly detected intradiskal leakage (75%) but had a considerably lower sensitivity for visualizing epidural (21%), extravertebral (31%), and intravascular (51%) cement leakages. A comparison of radiography and CT showed that radiography had a high sensitivity for detecting intradiskal (82%) and intravascular (70%) cement extrusions but a lower sensitivity in identifying epidural (42%) and extravertebral (50%) leaks. Therefore, the CT scan overall was best in detecting location and accuracy. Conclusion CT detected more cement leaks than any of the other investigated techniques, especially epidural, extravertebral, and intravascular cement leakages. To achieve the best accuracy, only CT provides complete information.Copyright © 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.",Excluded,0.038167797

3232,"Temporal evolution of parotid volume and parotid apparent diffusion coefficient in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy investigated by magnetic resonance imaging: A pilot study. Purpose: To concurrently quantify the radiation-induced changes and temporal evolutions of parotid volume and parotid apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 11 NPC patients (9 men and 2 women; 48.7 +/- 11.7 years, 22 parotid glands) were enrolled. Radiation dose, parotid sparing volume, severity of xerostomia, and radiation-to-MR interval (RMI) was recorded. MRI studies were acquired four times, including one before and three after radiotherapy. The parotid volume and the parotid ADC were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and MedCalc. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. A P value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Result(s): The parotid volume was 26.2 +/- 8.0 cm3before radiotherapy. The parotid ADC was 0.8 +/- 0.15 x 10-3mm2/sec before radiotherapy. The parotid glands received a radiation dose of 28.7 +/- 4.1 Gy and a PSV of 44.1 +/- 12.6%. The parotid volume was significantly smaller at MR stage 1 and stage 2 as compared to pre-RT stage (P <.005). The volume reduction ratio was 31.2 +/- 13.0%, 26.1 +/- 13.5%, and 17.1 +/- 16.6% at stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The parotid ADC was significantly higher at all post-RT stages as compared to pre-RT stage reciprocally (P <.005 at stage 1 and 2, P <.05 at stage 3). The ADC increase ratio was 35.7 +/- 17.4%, 27.0 +/- 12.8%, and 20.2 +/- 16.6% at stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The parotid ADC was negatively correlated to the parotid volume (R = -0.509; P <.001). The parotid ADC was positively associated with the radiation dose significantly (R2 = 0.212; P =.0001) and was negatively associated with RMI significantly (R2 = 0.203; P =.00096) significantly. Multiple regression analysis further showed that the post-RT parotid ADC was related to the radiation dose and RMI significantly (R2 = 0.3580; P <.0001). At MR stage 3, the parotid volume was negatively associated with the dry mouth grade significantly (R2 = 0.473; P <.0001), while the parotid ADC was positively associated with the dry mouth grade significantly (R2 = 0.288; P =.015). Conclusion(s): Our pilot study successfully demonstrates the concurrent changes and temporal evolution of parotid volume and parotid ADC quantitatively in NPC patients treated by IMRT. Our results suggest that the reduction of parotid volume and increase of parotid ADC are dominated by the effect of acinar loss rather than edema at early to intermediate phases and the following recovery of parotid volume and ADC toward the baseline values might reflect the acinar regeneration of parotid glands.

3233,"Induction treatment in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer. Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises a highly heterogeneous group of patients defined according to the extent and localization of disease. Patients with discrete N2 involvement identified preoperatively with resectable disease are candidates for multimodal therapy either with definitive chemoradiation therapy, induction chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy (CTRT) followed by surgery. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has yielded comparable survival benefit to adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage II-III disease and may allow for downstaging the tumor or the lymph nodes, an earlier delivery of systemic treatment, and better compliance to systemic therapy. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as induction therapy shows encouraging activity and a favorable safety profile in patients with resectable early stage or locally advanced NSCLC. An unprecedented rate of pathological response and downstaging has been reported in single-arm clinical trials, especially when immunotherapy is combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Ongoing randomized phase II/III clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of induction with immunotherapy plus chemotherapy have the potential to establish this therapeutic approach as a novel standard of care. These trials aim to validate pathological response as a surrogate marker of survival benefit and to demonstrate that this therapeutic strategy can improve the cure rate in patients with stage II-III NSCLC.Copyright © Translational Lung Cancer Research.

3234,"Safety and Feasibility of Performing Fenestrated Endovascular Abdominal Aneurysm Repair Using a Portable C-arm Without Fusion Technology: A Single-Center Experience. Objective Most centers performing fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (F-EVAR) use hybrid rooms with fusion technology for mapping. We present our experience of successfully performing F-EVAR using C-arm without fusion technology. Methods During the period of January 2016 to October 2018, data were collected from a prospectively maintained F-EVAR database at our tertiary care institute. The primary endpoint was technical success, and the secondary outcomes measured were short- and midterm clinical success (both defined by the Society for Vascular Surgery reporting standards), blood loss, radiation dose, operative time, postoperative endoleaks, aneurysm rupture, endograft patency, and complications. Results We performed 11 F-EVARs during the study period in five (45.5%) males and six (54.5%) females, with a mean age of 75+8 years. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia using OEC 9900 Elite Mobile C-arm (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) without the use of fusion technology. Three patients had planned preoperative open procedures for access due to prior cutdown or bypass. Technical success was achieved in all 11 (100%) cases. The mean length of stay was 5+2 days, and the mean follow-up was 7.5+6.5 months. The mean procedure time was 301+167 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 361+233 mL. Mean fluoroscopy time was 72+31 minutes, and the mean radiation exposure time was 2,160+930 mGy. No patients required intraoperative transfusion. Thirty-day (short term) clinical success was achieved in 10 (90.0%), cases whereas six-month (midterm) clinical success was achieved in 7 (77.7%) patients. Branch vessel patency was 11 (100%) at 30 days and 9 (81.8%) at six months, and primary endograft patency was 100% (11) at six months. We had no perioperative mortality or major adverse cardiac event at 30 days. Thirty-day postoperative morbidity included readmission for pulmonary edema from cardiac failure in one patient. Two patients had clinically insignificant silent cardiac enzyme elevation. Three patients had re-interventions performed during the mean follow-up period. Two patients developed renal stent thrombosis resulting in renal insufficiency, which is defined as an increase in creatinine concentration >=0.5 mg/dL, without the need for dialysis. One type II endoleak was identified postoperatively that required trans-lumbar embolization. No type I or III endoleaks were identified during the study period. Asymptomatic common femoral artery thrombosis was seen on follow-up imaging in one patient. Conclusions We conclude that F-EVAR can be safely performed using C-arm without the use of fusion technology. Its utility can be expanded to centers with appropriate skill set but no hybrid technology. Copyright © 2020, Juneja et al.",Excluded,0.038286455
3235,"Use of neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and diffusion tensor imaging to avoid motor cortex complications in robotic stereotactic radiation therapy planning. Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of this preliminary study was to find out if motor cortex and the motor tract can be avoided in robotic stereotactic radiation therapy/radiosurgery (RT/SRS) planning by using individually made maps from these areas. Materials/Methods: Before radiation therapy planning, the motor cortex was mapped from 2 meningioma patients using neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) combined with a neuronavigation system. In addition, the descending motor pathways were determined with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. Planning CT and MRI scans were also taken. Images were registered in treatment planning software by using a mutual image information algorithm and, in the case of nTMS, map manual registration via external markers. Two RT plans were made both with and without using the motor cortex and descending motor pathways as organs at risk (OARs). Dosimetric analysis was conducted comparing these plans with a focus on target coverage and motor cortex sparing. Result(s): Individual anatomical information from the motor cortex and motor pathways were imported into the RT planning system. Dosimetric analysis is described in Table 1. (Table Presented) Conclusion(s): For the 2 patients, the motor cortex and descending motor pathways were mapped before robotic stereotactic RT for meningioma. These are both noninvasive procedures and easy for the patients. The new OARs were able to be spared without compromising target irradiation. Sparing of the motor cortex and descending motor pathways was noticeable in their 0.01 mL maximum doses, being respectively 11.4% and 6.3% for patient 1 and 54.4% and 16.1% for patient 2. There were no differences in mean values, due the large volume of these OAR structures and the high dose gradients of the robotic stereotactic RT. Target coverage and mean dose were not affected by sparing of the motor cortex with either patient. With using this individual functional information to avoid motor cortex areas in RT planning we were able to spare selected patients from possible adverse effects without compromising target dose coverage. As the study is in a preliminary stage, in the future, motor area information will be mapped from more intracranial RT patients, and this information will be used to spare the motor area better than has thus far been possible.

3236,"Reliability of appendicular muscle mass assessment by bioelectrical impedance analysis vs. dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in hemodialysis patients. Background: Loss of skeletal muscle mass(MM) increases the risk for morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a valid tool for assessing skeletal MM but limited by cost and radiation exposure. In contrast, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is cheap and has no radiation exposure risk. Aim of this study was to assess the concordance between MM measured by BIA and DXA in HD patients. Method(s): We enrolled 55 clinically stable HD patients. Body composition, including appendicular lean muscle mass (ALM), was evaluated by BIA (Inbody S10) and whole body DXA (HOLOGIC). Hand grip strength (HGS) was performed to evaluate muscle performance. Agreement between tools was assessed by means of the Bland Altman method. Multiple linear regression was used to develop an ALM value by BIA closed to that by DXA. Result(s): The mean age was 63.4+/-11.29 years (range 39 to 88 years) and 65.5% were men. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension was 54.5% and 94.5%, respectively. There was a significant association between muscle mass index which determined via DXA and BIA. The mean value of ALM divided by the height2 (AMMI) was found to be 5.98+/-0.90 kg/m2 and 7.90 +/-1.39 kg/m2 by DXA and by BIA, respectively, indicating overestimation of ALM in BIA method. BIA overestimated total body lean mass in 98% of participants. Bland-Altman plots for differences in AMMI between BIA and DXA showed large bias (Mean= 1.92kg/m2), with significant mean differences ([0.29, 3.55], P<0.001). After adjusting for sex, age and BMI, AMMI by BIA was significantly correlated with those measure by DXA (R2=0.643, P<0.001). Using the formula, we can estimate the AMMI by DXA with AMMI by BIA (DXA=0.859+0.452BIA+0.068BMI, R2=0.709, P<0.001). Mean HGS was 24.6+/-7.90 kg and AMMI showed no correlation with the HGS. Conclusion(s): Our results showed that AMMI measured by BIA is reliable but overestimated in HD patients.

3237,"Sleep Disturbance and Pain Severity and Multi-site Pain: A Prospective 10.7-year Follow-up Study. Background/Purpose: Sleep disturbance is often comorbid with chronic pain disorders, with emerging evidence suggesting a stronger effect of sleep disturbance on pain than vice versa; however, few studies have evaluated the long-term effect of sleep disturbance on pain. This study sought to examine the association of sleep disturbance with knee pain severity and number of painful sites (NPS) and investigate whether persistent sleep disturbance increases the risk of persistent pain. Method(s): 1,099 community-dwelling older adults (age: mean+/-SD, 63+/-7.5 years; 51% female) were recruited and followed-up at 2.6, 5.1 and 10.7-year later. Data on demographics, body mass index, physical activity, comorbidities were collected. At each time-point, sleep disturbance, knee pain severity and NPS were assessed by using questionnaires. Radiographic knee osteoarthritis (ROA) was measured using x-ray. Multi-site pain (MSP) was defined as NPS >=2. Persistent pain was defined as having knee pain or MSP at all time-points. Multivariable mixed-effects models and log-binomial regression were applied for the analyses. Result(s): Sleep disturbance was associated with greater knee pain severity (beta 0.91, 95%CI 0.70-1.11) and higher risk of having more NPS [(Relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95%CI 1.07-1.14] in a dose-response manner in multivariable analyse with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, physical activity, comorbidities, pain medications, ever smoking, emotional problems, employment, and education level. Persistent sleep disturbance was associated with a greater risk of persistent knee pain (RR 1.90, 1.26-2.87) and MSP (RR 1.29, 1.07-1.56). In participants with ROA, results were similar apart from the link between sleep disturbance and persistent pain. pain.

The excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency complementation group 1 (ERCC1), and X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) genes appear to protect mammalian cells from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation. We conducted a large case-control study to investigate the association of polymorphisms in ERCC1 C118T, ERCC1 C8092A, XRCC1 A194T, XRCC1 A194T, and XRCC3 C241T, with glioma risk in a Chinese population. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped, using the MassARRAY IPLEX platform, in 443 glioma cases and 443 controls. Association analyses based on an chi2 test and binary logistic regression were performed to determine the odds ratio (OR) and a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each SNP. For XRCC1 Arg194Trp, the variant genotype T/T was strongly associated with a lower risk of glioma cancer when compared with the wild type C/C (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.43-4.45). Individuals carrying the XRCC1 399A allele had an increased risk of glioma (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.02-1.64). The XRCC3 241T/T genotype was associated with a strong increased glioma risk (OR = 3.78, 95% CI = 1.86-9.06). Further analysis of the interactions of two susceptibility-associated SNPs, XRCC1 Arg194Trp and XRCC3 Thr241Met, showed that the combination of the XRCC1 194T and XRCC3 241T alleles brought a large increase in glioma risk (OR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.54-4.04).

3239,"Differentiation of salivary gland tumors through tumor heterogeneity: a comparison between pleomorphic adenoma and Warthin tumor using CT texture analysis. Purpose: We compared the diagnostic performance of CT texture analysis in single-phase CT scan with that of conventional enhancement pattern analysis in a two-phase CT scan for discrimination of salivary gland tumors, Warthin tumor (WT) from pleomorphic adenoma (PA). Method(s): One hundred seventy-eight patients with PA and 84 patients with WT were selected and CT texture analysis was separately performed on early (40s) and delayed (180s) phases, after injection of the contrast agent, using commercially available software. The attenuation changes and enhancement patterns were visually and quantitatively assessed with Hounsfield units (HU). Differences between PAs and WTs were analyzed using chi2 test and independent t test. Diagnostic performance of texture parameters in single-phase CT was compared with that of dynamic enhancement pattern in two-phase CT using the McNemar test. Result(s): Ratio of tumoral HU (delayed phase/early phase) was significantly higher in PAs compared with WTs (p < 0.001). Tumor heterogeneity parameters, standard deviation (SD) and entropy, were significantly lower in WTs regardless of the type of filter used (p <= 0.001). Mean with coarse filter (AUC = 0.944) on early phase scan and entropy with medium filter (AUC = 0.901) on delayed scan were best discriminators between PAs and WTs. Diagnostic accuracy of mean (90.5%) on early scan and entropy (84.7%) on delayed scan was not significantly different from the accuracy (89.3%) of conventional wash-out pattern for distinguishing WTs from PAs (p = 0.742, p = 0.088, respectively). Conclusion(s): Diagnostic performance of texture parameters was similar to that of quantitative enhancement pattern for differentiating WTs from PAs, with the advantage in lower radiation exposure.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded,0.038492955

3241,"Protected and unprotected radiation exposure to the eye lens of vascular surgeons during endovascular procedures in hybrid operating rooms. Objective: Radiation induced cataract has been observed at lower threshold doses than expected. Therefore, the annual limit for equivalent dose to the eye lens has been reduced from 150 to 20 muSv. We aimed to evaluate radiation exposure to the eye lens of vascular surgeons working in a hybrid operating room before and after a dose reduction program was established. Method(s): Prospective non-randomized trial with a historic control group. From April-October 2019, radiation exposure to the operator was measured during all endovascular procedures performed in the hybrid operating room using BeOSL Hp(3) eye lens dosimeters placed outside the 0.75mm lead equivalent glasses on the side of the radiation source and behind the lead glasses. Measured values were compared to data from a prospective study performed at the same center in the years of 2012 and 2013 before a dose reduction program had been implemented. Result(s): A total of 181 consecutive patients underwent an endovascular procedure in the hybrid operating room. The mean unprotected eye lens dose of the main operator was 0.119 muSv for EVAR (n=30), 0.118 muSv for TEVAR (n=23), 0.312 muSv for more complex aortic procedures (F/BrEVAR; n=15) and 0.046 muSv for peripheral interventions. Compared to the control period, EVAR had 75% lower, TEVAR 79% lower and more complex aortic procedures 55% lower radiation exposure unprotected eye lens of the operator. The 0.75mm lead equivalent glasses led to a median reduction of the exposure to the eye lens by the factor 3.43. Behind the lead glasses at the level of the eye lens, radiation exposure exceeding the detection limit of 0.042 muSv was measured only in 22 of 181 cases. There was a significant correlation between DAP between both protected and unprotected eye lens dose (p<0.0001, r2 = 0.512 and 0.282). DAP correlated significantly with patients' body mass index, operating time, fluoroscopy time and digital subtraction angiography time. Conclusion(s): The dose reduction program at our institution has led to a relevant reduction of the radiation dose to the head and the eye lens of the main operator in endovascular procedures. With optimum radiation protection measures including a ceiling-mounted shield and 0.75mm lead equivalent glasses, more than 440 EVARs, 280 TEVARs or 128 FEVARs could be performed per year until the dose limit for the eye lens of 20 muSv would be reached.",Excluded,0.045277357
3242,"The effect of exposure duration on the biological activity of mobile telephony radiation. In the present experiments we studied the effects of different durations of a single (continuous), daily exposure, ranging from 1 min up to 21 min, to the two established systems of digital mobile telephony radiation that are commonly used in Europe, viz. GSM 900 MHz (Global System for Mobile telecommunications) and DCS 1800 MHz (Digital Cellular System-referred to also as GSM 1800 MHz), on a well-tested biological model, the reproductive capacity of the insect Drosophila melanogaster. The insects were exposed to each type of radiation at an intensity of about 10 microW/cm(2), corresponding to a distance of 20 or 30 cm from the antenna of a DCS 1800 or a GSM 900 mobile phone handset, respectively. At these distances the bioactivity of mobile telephony radiation was found to be at a maximum due to the existence of a ""window"" of increased bioactivity around this value, as we have shown recently [1-4]. The results show that the reproductive capacity decreases almost linearly with increasing exposure duration to both GSM 900 and DCS 1800 radiation, suggesting that short-term exposures to these radiations have cumulative effects on living organisms. Additionally, our results show again that GSM 900 MHz radiation is slightly more bioactive than DCS 1800 MHz radiation, at the same exposure durations and under equal radiation intensities, as shown in our previous experiments [5].

3243,"[Technique and radiation dose of conventional X-rays and computed tomography of the sacroiliac joint]. Anterior-posterior (a.p.) or posterior-anterior X-rays of the sacroiliac joint, sometimes supplemented by a transverse view, have been the method of choice for diagnosis of patients suspected of having sacroiliitis. The sensitivity and specificity of conventional X-rays are relatively low, which can delay the diagnosis of sacroiliitis. Computed tomography (CT) is superior to conventional X-rays for diagnosis of sacroiliitis, but does emit a relatively higher dose of radiation. For this reason, particularly for females, CT should be optimized by employing semi-coronal planes which require a lower radiation dose than axial planes. CT in a semi-coronal plane causes minimal radiation to the ovaries, and the effective radiation dose for women might even be lower than with conventional AP X-rays. Therefore, for suspected sacroiliitis in young women, CT in the semi-coronal plane is the preferred imaging method with respect to diagnostics and radiation protection when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not available. Male gonads can be protected from radiation doses in conventional X-rays, and CT as the primary imaging method can only be justified in these cases because of its better diagnostic capabilities.

Thus, when available, MRI should be given preference for diagnosis of sacroiliitis.",Excluded,0.038618527
3244,"The omentum: an account of its use in the reconstruction of the chest wall. Ten patients with lesions of the chest wall amenable to surgical therapy were reconstructed by a transposition flap of the greater omentum. Eight of these patients had been previously treated for cancer of the female breast by mastectomy and irradiation or by irradiation alone (in one instance). Of these 8, 6 had progressive ulceration of the chest wall consistent with radiation necrosis and three had residual carcinoma within the ulcer. One patient had melanoma of the chest wall still persistent after surgical resection and irradiation. Another had epidermoid carcinoma, whereas two sought breast reconstruction after successful mastectomy for cancer. In five patients the omentum was transposed directly on the pleura and lung or chest wall. In three patients prolene mesh was interposed to stabilize the chest wall. In two patients the defect attendant upon a Halsted mastectomy was ameliorated by a one-stage reconstruction using transposed omentum to cover a silastic gel prosthesis and to support an overlying skin graft. In three patients there were mild transient symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction postoperatively. In one patient delayed healing occurred because of partial separation of the omentum from the underlying irradiated pleura and in another there was partial loss of skin graft and omentum due to hematoma. A closed wound was achieved in all cases without infection.",Excluded,0.038514774
3245,"Detection of suspected recurrent pancreatic adeno-carcinoma: Comparison of fluorine-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET) with contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) and serum CA 19.9. AIM: To establish the value of PET in the detection of suspected recurrent pancreatic adeno-carcinoma previously operated in comparison to contrast-enhanced multidetector CT and serum CA19.9. METHOD(S): Twenty-two patients (6 men, 16 women - mean age 77.6+/-2), previously operated for pancreatic adeno-carcinoma with suspected disease recurrence (increased CA19.9 > 40U/ml) were enrolled. Both PET and CT were performed in all cases. After visual analysis, maximum Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax) of PET focal uptakes were calculated. PET data were compared to CT findings. The value of serum CA19.9 was also compared with the SUVmax obtained from each patient (in case of a patient with multiple lesions we considered the one with greater SUV max). RESULT(S): Out of 22 patients enrolled, 5 (22.7%) negative results at both PET and CT. In the 17 positive cases (77.3%) PET overall showed 26 areas of focal uptake divided as follow: 3 in pancreatic bed, 9 hepatic, 2 pulmonary, 9 nodal (7 sub diaphragmatic, 2 supra diaphragmatic) and 3 peritoneal. On the other hand CT overall showed 50 areas of contrast enhancement divided as follow: 1 in pancreatic bed, 6 in bone, 19 hepatic, 5 pulmonary, 17 nodal (12 sub diaphragmatic, 5 supra diaphragmatic), 1 peritoneal and 1 in adrenal gland. From the comparison between CA19.9 and SUVmax obtained for each patients, in 12 out of 17 positive PET cases we observed a statistically significant correlation (p<0, 05) between CA 19.9 trend and SUVmax. Five patients (22, 7%) with positive PET showed a not significant correlation between CA19.9 and SUVmax trend. The five cases with negative both PET and CT showed lower CA 19.9 levels than patients with positive PET. CONCLUSION(S): In patients with suspected pancreatic adeno-carcinoma relapse after surgery, PET reliably detected local and peritoneal recurrences, whereas CT seemed to be more sensitive for the detection of hepatic, bone, nodal and lung metastases. Although less reliable in the identification of lymph nodes, PET is able to clearly highlight mediastinal lymph nodes. Furthermore, PET does not appear to be advantageous for the detection of non locoregional and extra-abdominal recurrences. Our experience showed a significant direct correlation between CA 19.9 increase and SUVmax. Negative PET and CT cases with positive CA19.9 are probably due to the small size of recurrent disease. To confirm our data an improvement in casuistry is required.",Excluded,0.03847538
3246,"Effect of chromosome size on aberration levels caused by gamma radiation as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful technique for detecting genomic alterations at the chromosome level. To study the effect of chromosome size on aberration formation, we used FISH to detect initial damage in individual prematurely condensed chromosomes (PCC) of gamma-irradiated G0 human cells. A linear dose response for breaks and a nonlinear dose response for exchanges was obtained using a chromosome 1-specific probe. FISH detected more chromosome 1 breaks than expected from DNA based extrapolation of Giemsa stained PCC preparations. The discrepancy in the number of breaks detected by the two techniques raised questions as to whether Giemsa staining and FISH differ in their sensitivities for detecting breaks, or is chromosome 1 uniquely sensitive to gamma-radiation. To address the question of technique sensitivity, we determined total chromosome damage by FISH using a total genomic painting probe; the results obtained from Giemsa-staining and FISH were nearly identical. To determine if chromosome 1 was uniquely sensitive, we selected four different sized chromosomes for paint probes and scored them for gamma-ray induced aberrations. In these studies the number of chromosome breaks per unit DNA increased linearly with an increase in the DNA content of the chromosomes. However, the number of exchanges per unit of DNA did not increase with an increase in chromosome size. This suggests that chromosome size may influence the levels of aberrations observed. Extrapolation from measurements of a single chromosome's damage to the whole genome requires that the relative DNA content of the measured chromosome be considered.",Excluded,0.9707789
3247,"Mitochondrial DNA somatic mutations are frequent in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common cancers in southern China, and is highly sensitive to radiotherapy. The control region (D-loop) of mtDNA is a polymorphic region in which point mutations occur frequently. In this study, point mutation and common deletion (CD) mutations were investigated in 23 samples of NPC tumor tissue and in the radiation-treated NPC cell line CNE2. Polymorphisms at 72 (7.28%, 72/988) nucleotide positions in D-loop region and 6 (0.75%, 6/795) nucleotide positions in part of the functional gene encoding regions were detected in all NPC patients. Of the detected polymorphisms, 8 are novel. These variants are nonencoding transitions, including np292T-->C , np517G-del, np16038A-->G, np513G-del, np16242C-->A, np513G-del, np16242C-->A and np15787T-->C transition. A total of 39 point mutations in the D-loop region of mtDNA were detected in 43.5% (10/23) of the NPC patients. Three point mutations in the functional gene encoding regions of mtDNA were detected in only 8.7% (2/23) of NPC patients. The effect of he mutation at np709G-->A in the 12sRNA gene is unclear, and the A-->G substitution at np15769 in the cytochrome B gene is a synonymous mutation. The C-->T substitution at np15970 in the T Psi C loop of the tRNA(pro) gene could alter the position of the proline residue. After irradiation, the survival fraction of CNE2 cells decreased as X-ray dose increased. Moreover, X-ray radiation could induce apoptosis and the CD mutation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but did not induce mtDNA point mutations. A positive correlation between the apoptosis index and the ratio of CD/WT mtDNA was observed in irradiated CNE2 cells. Our results suggest that CD mutation induced by irradiation is one of the late events after apoptosis of the cancer cells, and the mtDNA CD mutation may associated with the susceptibility of NPC cells to IR-induced apoptosis.",Excluded,0.970759

3249,"Untreated male osteoporosis: Case report. Objective: To underline problems connected with osteoporosis in men through case report. There are need to clarify the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and fractures in men and to develop diagnostic criteria as well as establish most effective treatment. Material(s) and Method(s): After low intensive trauma 64 years old man had back pain and pain in left forearm. X-ray show fractures of Th 12 and L2 vertebrae and left forearm. In his personal history there is also after low intensive trauma elbow and hip fracture in ages of 52 and 53. There are no other risk factor in personal and family history. DXA evaluation results: T-score total LS vertebrae -4.7 SD and T-score total -2.4 healthy hip. Laboratory tests: high rate of thyroid hormone and low rate of 25OH vitamin D. We started with treatment. Result(s): Osteoporosis is leading causes of morbidity and mortality in elderly. "" Silent disease"" progress without symptoms until a fractures occurred. Hip fracture is very serious complication. One fifth of it occurred in men but it rise about 10 years later than in woman. In 65-70 ages men loosing bone mass at the same rate as woman and the absorption of calcium decrease in both sex. For men before 65 years and high risk men recommendation is to begin periodic osteoporotic risk assessment and performing DXA. When we have diagnosis it is important to consider and exclude secondary causes of bone loss. It is almost certain lifestyle, diseases and medications. More than 40 % are primary or idiopathic osteoporosis in men. Careful history, physical examination and laboratory tests are enough component for making decision about treatment. Except medication men should be educated about adequate lifestyle measures as the prevention. Conclusion(s): Osteoporosis in men is an important and often overlooked problem. The consequences of it are underestimated and the condition is often unrecognised and untreated. There is no sufficient scientific based evidence for men osteoporosis.

The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of helical CT in the assessment of intraocular foreign bodies, evaluating two protocols with different collimation. We performed helical-CT studies in 30 patients. Fifteen patients were examined with 1.5-mm collimation and the other 15 patients with 3.0-mm collimation. All other imaging parameters were identical in both protocols. Multiplanar images were reconstructed. The examinations were reviewed for presence, localization and size of intraocular foreign bodies. We compare our results with the surgical data. We estimate the required examination time. In the first group (collimation 1.5 mm) an intraorbital foreign body was detected in 8 of 15 patients. In 3 of 8 patients an intraocular foreign body (all were metallic) was detected. In the second group (collimation 3.0 mm) an intraorbital foreign body was detected in 9 of 15 patients. In 8 of 9 patients an intraocular foreign body (all were metallic) was detected. Our results were confirmed by surgery in all cases. Examination time was 36 s in the first group and 18 s in the second group. Computed tomography should be considered the imaging modality of choice in the assessment of metallic intraocular foreign bodies and 3.0-mm collimation is optional, because of reduced examination time and radiation exposure.",Excluded,0.038560092
3251,"Narrow-band ultraviolet B radiation induces the expression of beta-endorphin in human skin in vivo. BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from the sun and solaria has addictive properties that may develop into dependence. In mice, UVR addiction was connected to beta-endorphin (beta-END) formed in the skin after UVR exposure. In humans, the formation of beta-END in skin keratinocytes has not been confirmed in vivo., OBJECTIVE: To determine with immunohistochemistry if sub-erythematous narrow-band UV-B (NB-UV-B) exposures stimulate p53 mediated expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), beta-END and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) in human skin keratinocytes in vivo., METHODS: Within 12 healthy volunteers, 7 received a single 1 standard erythema dose (SED) of NB-UV-B on their whole body, and 5 volunteers received a cumulative dose of 3 SED delivered on two subsequent days i.e., 1+2 SED. Skin biopsies were taken immediately before the first exposure and at 24h from the last UV-B exposure to assess p53, beta-END, POMC, and alpha-MSH expression., RESULTS: Nuclear p53 expression increased in all samples taken at 24h after NB-UV-B exposure. UV-B irradiation also increased epidermal beta-END expression in 11 out of 12 samples taken at 24h after UV-B exposure. The brownish staining was localized in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes and around the nuclei, being more pronounced in the basal cell layers. POMC and alpha-MSH staining showed no obvious meaningful increase since only one section of each showed any change compared with basal levels., CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to show that UV-B exposures increase beta-END expression in epidermal keratinocytes of human skin in vivo, which could be the link to proposed UVR addiction.

3252,"The effects of extracorporeal photochemotherapy on T cell activation and regulatory mechanisms in patients with systemic sclerosis. In the study, we investigated the influence of extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) on lymphocyte activation and cell death by determining CD95, Annexin V, CD69 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression on circulating T and B cells in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients and assessed their changes after ECP therapies. Moreover, we evaluated the relationship between lymphocyte activation and the observed changes in immunoregulatory functions following ECP treatments. We enrolled 19 SSc patients, who received 12 ECP treatments in total. Blood samples were taken prior to the first therapy and 6 weeks after each cycle. Samples were also obtained from 16 healthy controls. Lymphocyte subgroups were quantified by flow cytometry. Initially, patients had higher numbers and percentages of peripheral CD95+ T cells, but not CD95+ B cells, compared to control values. After ECP treatments, values of CD95+ T cells decreased and became similar to controls. Annexin V expression on T and B cells did not change during the therapy. We observed a significant negative correlation between the changes in percentages of peripheral CD95+ T cells and CD4+CD25 + Treg cells. Although neither early-activated (CD69+) nor lateactivated (HLA-DR+) T lymphocytes showed significant changes after ECP, clear negative correlations developed between them and the functional ability of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells after the last treatment. Our results indicate that the initial increase of CD95+ expression in SSc presumably reflects a physiological response to the pronounced autoimmune processes, which can be effectively attenuated by the restoration of regulative T cell numbers and functions as the result of ECP therapy. © Clinical Rheumatology 2012.",Excluded,0.16757907
3253,"Correlation of pharyngeal residue with penetration- aspiration in post-radiotherapy nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia. Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) ranks first for head and neck malignancies, and radiotherapy is a recommended treatment. Most post-radiotherapy NPC patients experience oropharyngeal dysphagia that results in pharyngeal residue. Pharyngeal residue is thought to be a risk factor for aspiration-penetration. Objective(s): Examining the correlation between pharyngeal residue and penetration-aspiration in postradiotherapy NPC patients. Method(s): Participants have been identified since 2018 to find out the total number of NPC patients. In the period January-October 2019, identification of NPC patients was performed according to participant criteria. Participants were examined for fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), pharyngeal residue using the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale (YPR-SRS), and penetration-aspiration using Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS). Statistical tests were used Spearman correlation test with p<0.05. Result(s): The highest participant's pharyngeal residue appeared in vallecula when given soft bolus (96.55%), and in pyriform sinus when given thick liquid bolus (72.41%). Most participants with soft bolus had the highest negative penetration (72.59%) and positive penetration in thick liquid bolus (51.72%), while most had negative aspirations with the lowest value (89.66%).

3254,"The interdependence between clinical features of rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid gland function, and the anti-hormonal antibodies. Background: According to the common notions, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immunopathological condition with complex autoimmune response, directed presumably to synovial tissue. Besides that, there are some organ involvements in RA, that can strongly affect the extent of the autoimmune reactions. One of this organs is thyroid gland, because changes of its function, either increase or decrease, modulate activity of immune cells and inflammation level on the whole. Production of antibodies, directed to T3 and T4, is a candidate mechanism of the thyroid involvement. Objective(s): The objectives of our study are detection of different thyroid conditions in RA including determination of lesion type and function assessment, as well as searching for interdependence between the clinical features of RA, type of thyroid involvement, and the level of the anti-hormonal antibodies. Method(s): The research was carried out in agreement with the principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (1997). Approval for the investigation was got from the Regional Medical Ethics Committee. We enrolled adult patients with RA, verified using ACR/EULAR criteria (2010). RA activity was determined by means of DAS28 index. Thyroid involvement was detected by clinical, ultrasound, and laboratory assessment, including TSH, free T3, free T4, and anti-TPO. Anti-T3 and anti-T4 antibodies were measured using ELISA and calculated in terms of optical density units (ODU). The positive cutoff values, 0.098 ODU for anti-T3 and 0.093 ODU for anti-T4, have been found using healthy controls (n=39). Results were expressed as means+/-standard errors, the differences were considered significant at p<0.05. Result(s): 75 patients with RA have been enrolled, including 61 (81.4%) women and 14 (18.6%) men, their age was from 25 to 78 years. Mean RA activity was 3.2+/-1.4 DAS28 points. Different visceral involvements were detected in 20 (26.7%) cases, and 5 (6.7%) of them had an overt clinical picture of thyroid lesions. The signs and symptoms for 4 of them were similar to Hashimoto's thyroiditis with hyperfunction, the remaining one was complied to the mixed toxic goiter. All these 5 patients had low TSH and quite high DAS28 score (4.8+/-1.9). However, the prevalence of subclinical thyroid disorders in RA was considerably higher. Virtually all the patients (n=73) have been revealed anti-T3 (0.128+/-0.047 ODU) and/or anti-T4 antibodies (0.152+/-0.050 ODU). There was no relationship between these antibodies and organ involvement, other than thyroid gland; RF titers also had no significant influence. We found some rather unexpected dependencies of these markers with X-ray RA stages, as well as with RA activity. There was a clear trend of elevation of mean anti-T4 concentration together with higher Steinbrocker stage (p=0.034, ANOVA), the inverse tendency have been observed for anti-T3 (p=0.047, ANOVA). Correlations of DAS28 score with anti-T4 (r=0.525, p=0.031) and anti-T3 (r=-0.391, p=0.040) were also opposite. There was another significant inverse correlation of DAS28 score and TSH concentration (r=-0.330, p=0.046). Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that though anti-T4 concentration is tended to be elevated, high RA activity can promote hyperthyroidism. This is probably due to either influence of these antibodies to T4 and T3 production, or immune disturbances caused by thyroid hyperfunction itself.",Excluded,0.03831673

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate whether single-fraction radiotherapy is equal to multiple fractions in the treatment of painful metastases., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study planned to recruit 1000 patients with painful bone metastases from four Norwegian and six Swedish hospitals. Patients were randomized to single-fraction (8 Gy x 1) or multiple-fraction (3 Gy x 10) radiotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study was pain relief, with fatigue and global quality of life as the secondary endpoints., RESULTS: The data monitoring committee recommended closure of the study after 376 patients had been recruited because interim analyses indicated that, as in two other recently published trials, the treatment groups had similar outcomes. Both groups experienced similar pain relief within the first 4 months, and this was maintained throughout the 28-week follow-up. No differences were found for fatigue and global quality of life.

3256,"53BP1 Repair Kinetics for Prediction of In Vivo Radiation Susceptibility in 15 Mouse Strains. We present a novel mathematical formalism to predict the kinetics of DNA damage repair after exposure to both low- and high-LET radiation (X rays; 350 MeV/n 40Ar; 600 MeV/n 56Fe). Our method is based on monitoring DNA damage repair protein 53BP1 that forms radiation-induced foci (RIF) at locations of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in the nucleus and comparing its expression in primary skin fibroblasts isolated from 15 mice strains. We previously reported strong evidence for clustering of nearby DSB into single repair units as opposed to the classic ""contact-first"" model where DSB are considered immobile. Here we apply this clustering model to evaluate the number of remaining RIF over time. We also show that the newly introduced kinetic metrics can be used as surrogate biomarkers for in vivo radiation toxicity, with potential applications in radiotherapy and human space exploration. In particular, we observed an association between the characteristic time constant of RIF repair measured in vitro and survival levels of immune cells collected from irradiated mice. Moreover, the speed of DNA damage repair correlated not only with radiation-induced cellular survival in vivo, but also with spontaneous cancer incidence data collected from the Mouse Tumor Biology database, suggesting a relationship between the efficiency of DSB repair after irradiation and cancer risk.Copyright ©2020 by Radiation Research Society.

BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Chronic radiation proctitis is a complication of radiotherapy for malignant pelvic diseases. Rectal bleeding caused by radiation proctitis is difficult to manage. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is an electrocoagulation technique that appears to be an effective and low-cost alternative to the use of lasers in gastrointestinal endoscopy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of APC, as well as patients' tolerance of the procedure, in the treatment of bleeding radiation-induced proctitis., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of 16 patients with chronic radiation proctitis were analyzed retrospectively. Their average age was 73.5 (range 62-80). Fifteen patients had prostate cancer, and one had uterine cancer. The average time to onset of symptoms after radiotherapy was 15 months (range 6-36 months). All patients had intermittent or daily rectal bleeding, and three patients needed blood transfusions. The severity of bleeding was graded from 0 to 4. APC treatment was administered every month; the argon gas flow was set at 0.6 l/min with an electrical power setting of 40 W., RESULTS: All patients were improved with APC treatment. A mean of 3.7 sessions was necessary to relieve symptoms. APC therapy resulted in a reduction in the mean severity score from 2.4 to 0.6. Seven patients had no recurrent rectal bleeding, and the bleeding was significantly reduced to occasional and negligible spotting (less than one bleeding episode per week) in nine patients. None of the patients required transfusions after treatment. During the follow-up period (average 10.7 months, range 8-28 months), one patient had a recurrence of rectal bleeding that required two repeat sessions. The tolerance was good, with no long-term treatment-related complications., CONCLUSIONS: APC is an effective, safe and well-tolerated treatment for rectal bleeding caused by chronic radiation proctitis. It should be considered as a first-line therapy for radiation proctitis.",Excluded,0.039658096

In 12 rats, 3D AR visualization of preprocedural MR images was performed before embolization. Procedural metrics including catheterization time and radiation exposure were compared vs a prospective cohort of 16 rats in which embolization was performed without AR. An additional cohort of 15 retrospective cases was identified and combined with the prospective control cohort (n = 31) to improve statistical power., RESULTS: A 37% reduction in fluoroscopy time, from 11.7 min to 7.4 minutes, was observed with AR when compared prospectively, which did not reach statistical significance (P = .12); however, when compared with combined prospective and retrospective controls, the reduction in fluoroscopy time from 14.1 min to 7.4 minutes (48%) was significant (P = .01). A 27% reduction in total catheterization time, from 42.7 minutes to 31.0 minutes, was also observed with AR when compared prospectively, which did not reach statistical significance (P = .11). No significant differences were seen in dose-area product or air kerma prospectively., CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional AR visualization of preprocedural imaging may aid in the reduction of procedural metrics in a preclinical model of transarterial embolization.

3259,"A minimally invasive assay for individual assessment of the ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity. Ionizing radiation induces DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) which activate the ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through transcription of genes including CDKN1A (p21) and BBC3 (PUMA). This pathway prevents genomic instability and tumorigenesis as demonstrated in heritable syndromes (e.g., Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT); Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS)). Here, a simple assay based on gene expression in peripheral blood to measure accurately ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity is described. The expression of p21, Puma and Sesn2 was determined in blood from mice with different gene copy numbers of Atm, Trp53 (p53), Chek2 or Arf and in human blood and mitogen stimulated T-lymphocyte (MSTL) cultures from AT, AT carriers, LFS patients and controls, both before and after ex vivo ionizing irradiation. Mouse Atm/Chek2/p53 activity was highly dependent on the copy number of each gene except Arf. In human MSTL, an AT case, AT carriers and LFS patients showed responses distinct from healthy donors. The relationship between gene copy number and transcriptional induction upon radiation was linear for p21 and Puma and correlated well with cancer incidence in p53 variant mice. This reliable blood test provides an assay to determine ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity and demonstrates the feasibility of assessing the activity of this essential cancer protection pathway in simple assays.

Material(s) and Method(s): Eighty-three patients who had undergone CT venography of the lower extremities with MBIR at 80 kVp (Group A; 21 men and 20 women; mean age, 55.5 years) or ASIR-V at 70 kVp (Group B; 18 men and 24 women; mean age, 57.3 years) were enrolled. Two radiologists retrospectively evaluated the objective (vascular enhancement, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio [SNR], contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) and subjective (quantum mottle, delineation of contour, venous enhancement) image quality indicators at the inferior vena cava and femoral and popliteal veins. Clinical information, radiation dose, reconstruction time, and objective and subjective image quality indicators were compared between groups A and B. Result(s): Vascular enhancement, SNR, and CNR were significantly greater in Group B than in Group A (p <= 0.015). Image noise was significantly lower in Group B (p <= 0.021), and all subjective image quality indicators, except for delineation of vein contours, were significantly better in Group B (p <= 0.021).

3261,"Individual variations in the micronucleus assay for biological dosimetry after high dose exposure. The micronucleus assay is widely used as a biological dosimeter. Due to an inhibitory effect of radiation on cell proliferation the assay yields satisfactory results only when the absorbed dose is below about 5Gy. In 2002 Muller and Rode suggested that a modified version of the test, based on the analysis of the ratio of trinucleated to tetranucleated cells and the frequency of micronuclei (Mn) in binucleated cells containing at least one Mn, can be applied to detect a dose reaching 15Gy (Mutat. Res. 502 (2002) 47-51). Their conclusion was based on the results of experiments with lymphocytes from one donor and nothing is known about the possible influence of individual variability on the applicability of the Mn test to detect high doses of radiation. The aim of the present study was to validate the modified micronucleus assay with lymphocytes of 5 donors. Their blood was exposed to 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20Gy of 60Co gamma rays. The levels of Mn and of cell proliferation were assessed using various approaches. A strong inter-individual variability was observed for all endpoints.

I used a self-administered postal questionnaire survey sent to all 200 GPs working in municipal general practices in Bergen to investigate their knowledge about radiation doses and the risks associated with ionizing radiation. The response rate was 47%. Most GPs showed poor knowledge of radiation doses and associated risks. Male GPs had greater knowledge compared with female GPs (P=0.049). GPs with training in radiation safety had significantly greater knowledge compared with those with no radiation safety training (P=0.005).

3263,"Chemoradiotherapy for extrahepatic bile duct cancer with gross residual disease after surgery. Background: The purpose of the present study was to analyze the outcome of chemoradiotherapy for extrahepatic bile duct (EHBD) cancer patients with gross residual disease after surgical resection. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 30 patients with EHBD adenocarcinoma who underwent chemoradiotherapy after palliative resection (R2 resection). Postoperative radiotherapy was delivered to the tumor bed including residual tumor and regional lymph nodes (range=40-55.8 Gy). Most patients underwent chemoradiotherapy concurrently with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or gemcitabine. Result(s): The 2-year locoregional progression-free, distant metastasis-free and overall survival rates were 33.3%, 42.4% and 44.5%, respectively. High radiation dose >=50 Gy had a marginally significant impact on superior locoregional progression-free survival compared to 40 Gy (p=0.081). One patient developed grade 3 late gastrointestinal toxicity. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for EHBD cancer patients with gross residual disease after surgery was well-tolerated. There could be a chance for durable locoregional control and even long-term survival in selected patients.Copyright © 2014, International Institute of Anticancer Research.

3264,"Non-inferior low-dose coronary computed tomography angiography image quality with knowledge-based iterative model reconstruction for overweight patients. We investigated the feasibility of low-dose coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), using a prospective electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered axial scan protocol, knowledge-based iterative model reconstruction (IMR), and fixed tube current, in overweight subjects. Forty non-overweight (group A; body-mass index [BMI] < 25 kg/m2) and 40 overweight individuals (group B; BMI = 25-30 kg/m2), who underwent CCTA for coronary artery disease screening, were retrospectively and consecutively enrolled. A 64-slice CT scanner was used at 100-kVp tube voltage and 150-mA tube current, and images were reconstructed using IMR techniques. Image noise, attenuation at the aorta, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) at the proximal right and left main coronary arteries (pRCA and LMCA) were calculated. CCTA images were qualitatively evaluated using a four-point scale (1, poor; 4, excellent) and analyzed using a non-inferiority test with a predefined non-inferiority margin of -0.2. The mean CCTA radiation dose (Group A: 1.33 +/- 0.02 mSv; Group B: 1.35 +/- 0.10 mSv; p = 0.151) and mean aortic root CT attenuation values (Group A: 447.9 +/- 81.6 HU; Group B: 439.5 +/- 63.6 HU; p = 0.571) did not differ significantly between the two groups. The mean noise in groups A and B was 26.0 +/- 4.8 HU and 29.2 +/- 4.4 HU, respectively (p = 0.005). The noise reduction ratio in the groups, compared to filtered back projection, was 65.0% and 68.1%, respectively. The mean grade of image quality did not differ significantly (3.75 +/- 0.04 vs. 3.71 +/- 0.04, p = 0.478). Group B CCTA image quality was non-inferior (mean difference = -0.043, 95% CI = -0.162-0.077) to that of Group A. We concluded that low-dose CCTA with prospective ECG-triggering and IMR might be applied to overweight subjects, as well as to normal-weight subjects, by using a fixed tube current without an increase in tube current based on the patient's body size.Copyright © 2018 Park et al.

3265,"Self-awareness of computed tomography ordering in the emergency department. OBJECTIVES: Physician variation in the use of computed tomography (CT) is concerning due to the risks of ionizing radiation, cost, and downstream effects of unnecessary testing. The objectives of this study were to describe variation in CT-ordering rates among emergency physicians (EPs), to measure correlation between perceived and actual CT-ordering rates, to assess attitudes that influence decisions to order imaging tests, and to identify EP attitudes associated with higher CT utilization., METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of imaging and administrative billing records at two emergency department sites of a tertiary care adult teaching hospital. The study also included a cross-sectional survey of EPs at this hospital. We asked physicians about their perceived ordering behaviour, and what factors influenced their decision to order a CT. We examined correlations between perceived and actual CT-ordering rates. We adjusted ordering rates for shift distribution using a logistic regression model and identified outlier physicians whose ordering rate was significantly lower or higher than expected. We used multivariable regression analysis to determine which survey responses predicted higher CT utilization., RESULTS: During the study period, 59 EPs saw 45,854 patients, and ordered 6,609 CTs - a mean ordering rate of 14.4% (standard deviation (SD)=4.3%). The ordering rate for individual physicians ranged from 5.9% to 25.9%. Of the 59 EPs, 13 EPs were low-ordering outliers; 12 were high-ordering outliers. Forty-five EPs (76.3%) completed the survey. Mean perceived ordering rate was 12.6%, and was weakly correlated with actual ordering (r=0.19, p=0.21). 42 EPs (93.3%) believed they ordered ""about the same"" or ""fewer"" CTs than their peers. Of the 17 EPs in the two highest ordering quintiles, only 3 (18%) knew they were high orderers. In the multivariable analysis, higher ordering was associated with increasing strength of response to the following predictors: medico-legal risk (relative risk [RR]=1.18, 95% CI: 1.03-1.21), risk of contrast (RR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.07-1.22), what colleagues would do (RR=1.09, 95% CI: 0.99-1.19), risk of missing a diagnosis (RR=1.08, 95% CI: 0.98-1.21), and patient wishes (RR=1.07, 95% CI: 0.97-1.17)., CONCLUSIONS: There is large variation in CT ordering among EPs. Physicians' self-reported ordering rate correlates poorly with actual ordering. High CT orderers were rarely aware that they ordered more than their colleagues. Higher rates of ordering were observed among physicians who reported increased concern with 1) risk of missing a diagnosis, 2) medico-legal risk, 3) risk of contrast, 4) patient wishes, and 5) what colleagues would do.",Excluded,0.038424496
3266,"Salvage gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery followed by bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme: a case-control study. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GKSR) followed by bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy in 11 patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme who experienced tumor progression despite aggressive initial multi-modality treatment. Our experience included eight male and three female patients. The median patient age at GKSR was 62 years (range 46-72 years). At the time of GKSR, seven patients had a first recurrence and four had two or more recurrences. The median interval from the initial diagnosis until GKSR was 17 months (range 5-34.5 months). The median tumor volume was 13.6 cm(3) (range 1.2-45.1 cm(3)) and the median margin dose of GKSR was 16 Gy (range 13-18 Gy). Following GKSR, bevacizumab was administrated with irinotecan in nine patients and with temozolomide in one patient. One patient was treated with bevacizumab monotherapy. The treatment outcomes were compared to 44 case-matched controls who underwent GKSR without additional bevacizumab. At a median of 13.7 months (range 4.6-28.3 months) after radiosurgery, tumor progression was evident in seven patients. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 15 months (95% confidential interval (CI), 6.5-23.3 months). Six-month and 1-year PFS rates were 73 and 55%, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) from GKSR was 18 months (95% CI, 10.1-25.7 months) and 1-year OS rate was 73%. One patient (9%) experienced grade III toxicity and one patient (9%) had major adverse radiation effects. Compared with patients who did not receive bevacizumab, the patients who received bevacizumab had significantly prolonged PFS (15 months vs. 7 months, P = 0.035) and OS (18 months vs. 12 months, P = 0.005), and were less likely to develop an adverse radiation effect (9 vs. 46%, P = 0.037).

Intrinsic skin aging results in progressive loss of structural integrity and physiological function which is aggravated by unprotected exposure to solar radiation the most common source of extrinsic aging. Clinical signs for these aging are different with the latter characterized by dryness, irregular pigmentation, sallowness, laxity, telangiectasia and leathery appearance. Sunscreen actives minimize the effects of ultraviolet (UV) A and B rays, but have no effects on pre-existent alterations. Topically applied antioxidants are commonly used by the cosmetic industry due to their great tolerability profile broad efficacy spectrum and stability. The goal of this study was to investigate the benefits of a cosmetic formulation (TDR SPF34) in which SPF actives were mixed with a unique blend of antioxidants to provide protection against solar UV and infrared rays as well as evaluating its ability to repair and/or revert pre-existent damage. Study was conducted on volunteers with facial photo-damage (n=24). TDR SPF34 was applied once daily in the morning up to 12 weeks. Investigator assessment and standardized digital photographs were obtained at week 4, 8 and 12. Punch biopsies (n=5) were obtained at baseline and week 12. Investigator assessments showed statistically significant improvements at week 12 when compared to baseline. Also histological observations reported improvement in the thickening of epidermis, increased deposit of collagen I in dermis and collagen IV in the DEJ also enhanced levels of hyaluronic acid in dermis and epidermis. Reduction in the expression of MMP1 and mutant (m)p53 were also observed in epidermis. These observations suggest that the unique blend of antioxidants present in TDR SPF34 is able to revert clinical and histological signs of photo-aging.

3269,"Comparison of effective radiation dose between low-and conventional-dose protocols in patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography: A randomized blinded comparison. Background: Radiation exposure to the patient during coronary angiography or intervention is relatively high and considered to be potentially harmful. However, there is little data about the reduction strategy of radiation hazard. Purpose(s):We intended to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of low dose radiation protocols compared to current conventional dose protocols in the patients during diagnostic coronary angiography. Method(s): From February 2015 to October 2015, one hundred three consecutive patients (66.2+/-12.3 years old, 46 women (44.7%) who undertook diagnostic coronary angiography using Artis zeeTM angiography system were enrolled. After randomization of low- or conventional radiation dose protocols (LDP versus CDP), The patient underwent coronary angiography according to the standard angiography method (AP-Caudal, RAO-caudal, RAO-cranial, and LAO-cranial views of each 30 degrees, and spider view of 50 degrees and 30 degrees). The LDP consists of 10 frame rate (FR) per second during fluoroscopy and 40% reduced dose of conventional dose during cineangiography. The radial approach was used in all the procedures. We analyzed and compared the dose-area product (DAP: muGy m2), air-kerma (AK: mGy), exposure time (seconds), and FR between the LDP and CDP group. Result(s): Firstly, there is no significant interference to evaluate the coronary artery status by eyeball estimation between both groups. There are no significant basic demographics between the groups including age, body mass index or waist circumferences. Body weight is well correlated with the level of DAP and AK (gamma=0.27, p=0.006 and gamma=0.29, p=0.008 respectively). Marvelously, there are markedly reduction of effective radiation dose in the LDP group compared to CDP group (DAP, 1087.8+/-612.5 vs. 2188.2+/-949.4 muGy m2; AK, 171.5+/-111.6 vs. 348.1+/-178.3 mGy, p<0.001) by Mann-Whitney test, while on the similar total radiation exposure time (50.7+/-21.1 vs. 52.0+/-19.6 sec, p=0.739), FR (662.2+/-197.0 vs. 685.6+/-211.1, p=0.695), and image counts (10.1+/-2.0 vs. 10.7+/-3.5 images) by student t-test. Conclusion(s): The use of low dose radiation protocol was associated with nearly half amount reduction in exposure to patients undergoing diagnostic angiography without any significant loss of diagnostic information by eyeball estimation.

3270,"The first evidence for SLFN11 expression as an independent prognostic factor for patients with esophageal cancer after chemoradiotherapy. Background: Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) was recently identified as a dominant determinant of sensitivity to DNA-targeting agents including platinum-based drugs. SLFN11 also reportedly enhances cellular radiosensitivity. In this study, we examined the prognostic value of SLFN11 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT), including the platinum derivative nedaplatin. Method(s): Seventy-three patients with ESCC who received dCRT were examined. SLFN11 expression was analyzed in pre-dCRT biopsies using immunohistochemistry and evaluated using a histo-score (H-score). Correlation between the H-score and overall survival was analyzed. An H-score >= 51 was provisionally defined as indicating high SLFN11 expression. Viability assays were performed using previously established isogenic human cell lines differentially expressing SLFN11 to test the usefulness of SLFN11 as marker of response to the dCRT regimen. Result(s): High SLFN11 expression was independently associated with better prognosis in ESCC patients (hazard ratio = 0.295, 95% CI = 0.143-0.605, p = 0.001 for multivariate analysis). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the prognostic value of high SLFN11 expression was most evident in patients at clinical stages II and III (p = 0.004). In in vitro study, SLFN11-proficient cells were highly sensitive to platinum derivatives compared to SLFN11-deficient cells. Conclusion(s): SLFN11 expression is an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients treated with dCRT and a potential biomarker for treatment selection of ESCC. Examination of SLFN11 may be particularly useful for clinical Stage II-III patients who wish to choose dCRT (instead of surgery) to preserve esophageal function.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.108834535

Purpose: We performed this retrospective study to investigate the outcomes of patients with hemangioma of the cavernous sinus after fractionated radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): We analyzed 10 patients with hemangioma of the cavernous sinus who were treated with conventional radiotherapy between January 2000 and December 2016. The median patient age was 54 years (range, 31-65 years), and 8 patients (80.0%) were female. The mean hemangioma volume was 34.1 cm3 (range, 6.8-83.2 cm3), and fractionated radiation was administered to a total dose of 50-54 Gy with a daily dose of 2 Gy. Result(s): The median follow-up period was 6.8 years (range, 2.2-8.8 years). At last follow-up, the volume of the tumor had decreased in all patients. The average tumor volume reduction rate from the initial volume was 72.9% (range, 18.9-95.3%). All 10 of the cranial neuropathies observed before radiation therapy had improved, with complete symptomatic remission in 9 cases (90%) and partial remission in 1 case (10%). No new acute neurologic impairments were reported after radiotherapy. One probable compressive optic neuropathy was observed at 1 year after radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): Fractionated radiotherapy achieves both symptomatic and radiologic improvements. It is a well-tolerated treatment modality for hemangiomas of the cavernous sinus.Copyright © 2017.

3272,"A preliminary experience of moderate-intensity stereotactic body radiation therapy for ultra-central lung tumor. Purpose: Administration of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to ultra-central (UC) lung tumors, generally defined as those abutting the proximal bronchial trees, is difficult due to concerns about serious toxicities. Therefore, our institution has performed moderate-intensity SBRT. Patients and Methods: Patients with UC tumors underwent SBRT at a dose of 50-60 Gy in 10 fractions, with Dmax in the target volume not exceeding 110% of the prescribed dose. The primary outcomes were tumor response and overall survival (OS). Result(s): From January 2017 to September 2018, we treated eight patients who had been diagnosed with UC tumors. The median follow-up time was 8.6 months (range: 2.7-14.9). Five of the eight patients (62.5%) showed a complete response (CR), two (25%) had a partial response (PR), and one (12.5%) had stable disease (SD); the response and disease control rates were 87.5% and 100%, respectively. Seven patients were alive with no evidence of disease or with controlled disease until the last follow-ups, except for one patient who died due to a non-RT cause at 3 months after SBRT. One patient experienced grade 2 esophageal pain and another had grade 1 cough. No grade 3 or higher toxicities were reported. Conclusion(s): Moderate-intensity SBRT might aid in achieving good control of UC tumors without excessive toxicities. Future studies involving larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up times are warranted to confirm the efficacy and feasibility.© 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded,0.038160365
3273,"Improvement and induction property of radiation-responsive promoter through DNA shuffling of 5'-flanking regions of the human p21 gene. A promoter that augments gene expression in response to stimulation of ionizing radiation would be a desired tool for radiogenetic therapy, a combination of radiotherapy and gene therapy. Although various promoters occurring naturally or artificially have been used for researches, one showing higher reactivity to ionizing radiation is desirable. In the present study, we attempted to improve a radiation-responsive promoter of the p21 through a technique called DNA shuffling. A library of DNA fragments was constructed by re-ligation of randomly digested promoter fragments and improved promoters were chosen out of the library. We repeated this process twice to obtain a promoter showing 2.6-fold better reactivity to ionizing radiation compared with its parent, p21 promoter after 10 Gy gamma-ray irradiation. Nucleotide sequence analyses revealed that the obtained promoter was densely packed with some of the cis-acting elements including binding sites for p53, NF-kappaB, NRF-2, AP-1 and NF-Y more than p21 promoter. In addition, it was shown that its induction by ionizing radiation was dependent upon p53 status of a cell line, suggesting that the promoter retained properties of the p21 promoter. This technique is simple and efficient to improve a promoter responsive to other stimulus of interest besides IR. © 2009 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.",Excluded,0.97044253

In Japan, a robotic-assisted PCI (R-PCI) system, the CorPath GRX System (Corindus Inc.), has been approved for clinical use in 2018, which is the first introduction of R-PCI into Japan. In this study, the clinical performance of the R-PCI system in the initial year at Kurume University Hospital was evaluated comparing with conventional manual PCI (M-PCI). A total of 30 R-PCI and 77 M-PCI procedures performed between April 2019 and March 2020, were retrospectively included. The primary outcome was the rate of clinical success defined as < 30% residual stenosis without in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The secondary outcomes were fluoroscopy time, dose area product (DAP), amount of radiation exposure to operators and assistants, procedural time, and contrast volume. Propensity-matching technique was used to match each R-PCI lesion to the nearest M-PCI lesion without replacement. After propensity score matching, 30 R-PCI procedures in 28 patients and 37 M-PCI procedures in 35 patients were analyzed. Clinical success rate with R-PCI was favorable and comparable to M-PCI (93.3 vs. 94.6%, p = 0.97), without any in-hospital MACE. The operator radiation exposure was significantly lower in R-PCI (0 vs. 24.5 microSV, p < 0.0001). Radiation exposure to the patients was tended to be reduced by R-PCI (DAP: 77.6 vs. 100.2 Gycm2, p = 0.07). There were no statistically significant differences in radiation exposure to the assistant, fluoroscopy time, procedural time and contrast volume between the two groups (radiation exposure to the assistant: 10.5 vs. 10.0 microSV, p = 0.64, fluoroscopy time: 27.5 vs. 30.1 min, p = 0.55, procedural time: 72.4 vs. 61.6 min, p = 0.23, and contrast volume: 93.2 vs. 102.0 ml, p = 0.36).

Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a flowable hemostatic matrix, and their effects for postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) after pancreatectomy. Method(s): This was a randomized, clinical, single-center, single-blind (participant), non-inferiority, phase IV, and parallel-group trial. The primary endpoint was the incidence of POPF. The secondary endpoints were risk factors for POPF, drain removal days, incidence of complication, 90-day mortality, and length of hospital stay. Result(s): This study evaluated a total of 53 patients, of whom 26 patients were in the intervention group (flowable hemostatic matrix) and 27 patients were in the control group (thrombin-coated collagen patch). POPF was more common in the control group than in the intervention group (59.3% vs. 30.8%, p = 0.037). Among participants who underwent distal pancreatectomy, POPF (33.3% vs. 92.3%, p = 0.004), and clinically relevant POPF (8.3% vs. 46.2%, p = 0.027) was more common in the control group. A multivariate logistic regression model identified flowable hemostatic matrix use as an independent negative risk factor for POPF, especially in cases of distal pancreatectomy (DP) (odds ratio 17.379, 95% confidential interval 1.453-207.870, p = 0.024).

Purpose: To evaluate the predictive factors of radiation pneumonitis (RP) and associated changes in pulmonary function after definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Material(s) and Method(s): Medical records of 60 patients with NSCLC who received definitive CCRT were retrospectively reviewed. Dose volumetric (DV) parameters, clinical factors, and pulmonary function test (PFT) data were analyzed. RP was graded according to the CTCAE ver. 4.0. Percentage of lung volume that received a dose of threshold (Vdose) and mean lung dose (MLD) were analyzed for potential DV predictors. PFT changes were calculated as the difference between pre-RT and post-RT values at 3, 6, and 12 months after RT. Result(s): Twenty-two patients (37%) developed grade >=2 RP. Among clinical factors, tumor location in lower lobe was associated with RP. Among the DV parameters, only MLD >15 Gy was associated with grade >=2 RP. There were statistically significant decreases in PFT at all points compared with pre-RT values in grade >=2 RP group. MLD was associated with forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) changes at 6 and 12 months. V10 was associated with FVC changes at 12 months. V20 and V30 were associated with FEV1 changes at 6 months and FVC changes at 12 months. Conclusion(s): After definitive CCRT in patients with NSCLC, MLD >15 Gy and lower lobe tumor location were predictors of grade >=2 RP. Pulmonary functions were decreased after CCRT and the magnitude of changes was associated with DV parameters. © 2013. The Korean Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded,0.03900911
3277,"Development of hypothyroidism during long-term follow-up of patients with toxic nodular goitre after radioiodine therapy. Objective To investigate the cure rate and incidence of hypothyroidism of radioiodine treatment with a calculated dose regimen and an intended thyroid dose of 150 Gy in patients with toxic nodular goitre during long-term follow-up. Patients A total of 265 consecutive patients with toxic nodular goitre were treated between March 2003 and August 2004 at our institute and followed up for a maximum of 8 years. Preliminary radioiodine testing with volumetric measurement of the thyroid by ultrasound as well as individual thyroidal radioiodine uptake and half-life measurements were performed before radioiodine therapy. The estimated radiation dose to the thyroid was 150 Gy. Measurements Follow-up controls with respect to success of therapy and development of hypothyroidism were performed 3 months, 1 and up to 8 years after radioiodine treatment. The relation of the achieved thyroid dose to the success rate of treatment and to the incidence of hypothyroidism was analysed. Results The cure rates were 85% at 3 months, 98% at 1 year and 98% at the end of follow-up. Above an achieved thyroid dose of more than 120 Gy, there was no significant association between the dose achieved in the thyroid and the cure rate on follow-up. The incidences of hypothyroidism at 3 months, at 1 year and at the end of follow-up were 32%, 55% and 73%, respectively. Conclusions Radioiodine treatment with a calculated dose regimen is a highly effective treatment option in patients with toxic goitre with an overall success rate of 98%. However, radioiodine treatment with an intended thyroid dose of 150 Gy leads to a high incidence of hypothyroidism on long-term follow-up. This finding supports the suggestion that in future intended thyroid doses could be lowered in patients treated with a calculated dose regimen for toxic nodular goitre. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Excluded,0.042512037

All received radiotherapy with a median dose of 40 Gy (range, 40-56), and 61 patients received concomitant fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. MMP-9 was highly expressed in 33 patients (50.0%). MMP-9 expression was significantly associated with locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) and overall survival (OS) but not with distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). The 5-year LRRFS and OS rates were 50.8% versus 86.5% (p =.0281), and 23.3% versus 68.1% (p =.0087) in patients with low and high expression of MMP-9, respectively. Among the clinicopathologic factors, tumor location was associated with DMFS and OS (p =.0292 and.0003, respectively). Nodal stage and histologic differentiation showed significant association with DMFS (p =.0277 and.0060, respectively). Based on multivariate analysis for OS, tumor location was the only significant prognostic factor (p =.0021), while MMP-9 expression showed marginal significance (p =.0633). Conclusion(s): MMP-9 expression is a useful prognostic factor for predicting LRRFS and OS in patients with EHBD cancer after surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology",Excluded,0.9435255

3281,"A comparison of neuron response properties in areas A1 and CM of the marmoset monkey auditory cortex: tones and broadband noise. The purpose of this study was to compare response properties of two adjacent areas of the marmoset monkey auditory cortex. Multiunit responses to 50 ms tones and broadband noise bursts (BBN) were recorded in the core area, A1, and the caudomedial belt area, CM, of ketamine-anesthetized animals. Neurons in A1 and CM exhibited robust low-threshold short-latency responses to BBN and tones, whereas neurons in adjoining lateral belt areas were poorly responsive or unresponsive to tones and noise. Except for a population of broadly tuned units in CM, the characteristic frequency (CF) could be determined for all recording sites in A1 and CM. Both areas were tonotopically organized and shared a high CF border. Whereas the tonotopic gradient in A1 was smooth and continuous across the field, the gradient in CM was discontinuous, and the intermediate CF range was underrepresented. For BBN stimuli, rate level functions were largely monotonic in A1 and CM. Response profiles were also similar in both areas. As a population, neurons in CM were distinguished from A1 by significantly shorter response latencies, lower thresholds, and broader tuning bandwidth at higher intensities. The results indicated that, while A1 and CM represent anatomically and physiologically distinct areas, their response profiles under anesthesia overlapped considerably compared with the lateral belt areas. Therefore refinements of current models of the primate auditory cortex may be needed to account for differences in organization among the auditory belt areas.",Excluded,0.03859934
3282,"Radiation- and Age-Associated Changes in Peripheral Blood Dendritic Cell Populations among Aging Atomic Bomb Survivors in Japan. Previous immunological studies in atomic bomb survivors have suggested that radiation exposure leads to long-lasting changes, similar to immunological aging observed in T-cell-adaptive immunity. However, to our knowledge, late effects of radiation on dendritic cells (DCs), the key coordinators for activation and differentiation of T cells, have not yet been investigated in humans. In the current study, we hypothesized that numerical and functional decreases would be observed in relationship to radiation dose in circulating conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) among 229 Japanese A-bomb survivors. Overall, the evidence did not support this hypothesis, with no overall changes in DCs or functional changes observed with radiation dose. Multivariable regression analysis for radiation dose, age and gender effects revealed that total DC counts as well as subpopulation counts decreased in relationship to increasing age. Further analyses revealed that in women, absolute numbers of pDCs showed significant decreases with radiation dose. A hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression profiles in DCs after Toll-like receptor stimulation in vitro identified two clusters of participants that differed in age-associated expression levels of genes involved in antigen presentation and cytokine/chemokine production in cDCs. These results suggest that DC counts decrease and expression levels of gene clusters change with age. More than 60 years after radiation exposure, we also observed changes in pDC counts associated with radiation, but only among women.",Included,0.9707506

3284,"Some radiation effects on segregation in Drosophila. Translocation induced in the immature oocyte, in meiotic prophase, affects division I orientation and segregation, the usual result being that the two halves of translocations are directed to opposite poles. Since interchange is usually (if not exclusively) between chromatids, this is to be expected from the creation of illegitimate conjunctions. Good agreement is obtained between patterns of segregations deduced from recovered half-translocation bearing exceptions and the kinds of disomic gametes expected as alternative recoveries from the same division I configurations. Inferences drawn from the study of compound-X females have been found to apply as well in the case of females of normal karyotype. Numerical errors occur predominantly, possibly exclusively, in division I. The rate of induced nondisjunction of specific chromosome pairs varies in relation to the structure of the entire complement, as required if radiation-induced nondisjunction is interchange dependent, but which would be unexpected if the mechanism involved effects on individual spindle fibers, chromosomes, or chromosomal bivalents.",Excluded,0.9699892

3286,"16. The fraction of cancer attributable to lifestyle and environmental factors in the UK in 2010. This chapter summarises the results of the preceding sections, which estimate the fraction of cancers occurring in the UK in 2010 that can be attributed to sub-optimal, past exposures of 14 lifestyle and environmental risk factors. For each of 18 cancer types, we present the percentage of cases attributable to one or all of the risk factors considered (tobacco, alcohol, four elements of diet (consumption of meat, fruit and vegetables, fibre, and salt), overweight, lack of physical exercise, occupation, infections, radiation (ionising and solar), use of hormones, and reproductive history (breast feeding)).Exposure to less than optimum levels of the 14 factors was responsible for 42.7% of cancers in the UK in 2010 (45.3% in men, 40.1% in women)-a total of about 134 000 cases.Tobacco smoking is by far the most important risk factor for cancer in the UK, responsible for 60 000 cases (19.4% of all new cancer cases) in 2010. The relative importance of other exposures differs by sex. In men, deficient intake of fruits and vegetables (6.1%), occupational exposures (4.9%) and alcohol consumption (4.6%) are next in importance, while in women, it is overweight and obesity (because of the effect on breast cancer)-responsible for 6.9% of cancers, followed by infectious agents (3.7%).Population- attributable fractions provide a valuable quantitative appraisal of the impact of different factors in cancer causation, and are thus helpful in prioritising cancer control strategies. However, quantifying the likely impact of preventive interventions requires rather complex scenario modelling, including specification of realistically achievable population distributions of risk factors, and the timescale of change, as well as the latent periods between exposure and outcome, and the rate of change following modification in exposure level. © 2011 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.",Included,0.039274454
3287,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for idiopatic myelofibrosis: A single centre experience. Background: Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) is the only curative option for Myelofibrosis (MF). Development of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens and introduction of Ruxolitinib (Rux) have improved the outcome of ASCT. However, this procedure is still burdened by substantial morbidity and high transplantrelated mortality (TRM). Here we report our experience with ASCT in MF setting, in order to evaluate the factors influencing post-transplant outcome, in term of overall survival (OS) and Progression-free survival (PFS). Method(s): In the last 10 years we performed 30 ASCT on 27 MF patients (pts); 3 pts of them received a second ASCT for MF relapse. The median age was 51 (range: 25-68) years. Driver mutations were found in 23 pts and were: JAK2V617F in 16 (59%), MPL in 3(11%) and CALR mutations in 4 (15%) pts; 4 (15%) pts were defined as ""triple-negative"". According to Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) at transplant, pts were stratified into high, intermediate-2 and intermediate-1 risk in 11 (41%), 12 (44%) and 4 (15%) cases, respectively. Considering the first ASCT, donors were matched related (MRD), matched unrelated (MUD) and haploidentical in 18 (67%), 7 (26%), and 2 (7%) of cases, respectively. Conditioning regimen (CR) was RIC in 11 pts (41%) or myeloablative in 16 pts (59%); all CR were Busulfan and Fludarabine-based, in 48% of cases (n=13) associated with Tiothepa. Conventional GVHD prophylaxis regimens were used according to type of ASCT. Splenectomy or spleen irradiation were performed before ASCT in 2 and 6 pts in pre-Rux era; 16 pts (59%) received Rux before ASCT. Source of stem cells were bone marrow in 15 (56%) or peripheral blood stem cells in 12 (44%) pts. OS and PFS have been evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Result(s): Aafter a median follow-up of 18.5 (range: 0.5 - 175) months from first ASCT, 4/27 pts (15%) died for early TRM, 6 (22%) pts for MF relapse (4) or leukemic evolution (2). 17 (63%) pts were alive, 15 of them with full chimerism and complete remission (one after the second ASCT); 2 pts were alive in MF relapse. Chronic GVHD occurred in 6 (22%) pts. The probability of OS for the entire cohort at 2 and 5 years was respectively 75% and 60% and the 2 and 5 year PFS was 75% and 55% respectively. In statistical analysis, significant predictive factors of good outcome were: intermediate-1 DIPSS score at transplant, Rux-exposition pre-transplant and development of chronic GVHD. There was no correlation between clinical outcome and type of driver mutations, age at transplant, donor type, CR, source of stem cells. Conclusion(s): ASCT in MF is actually a valid therapeutic option for pts eligible to the procedure also in the Rux era. In our experience, earlier stage of MF at time of transplant and Rux exposition before transplant seem to have a favourable impact on the outcome post-ASCT; also a chronic GVHD seems to play a protective role for reducing relapse risk post-ASCT.",Excluded,0.03868237
3288,"Emotional determinants of life-space through GPS and ecological momentary assessment in schizophrenia: What gets people out of the house?. Background: Previous research employing global positioning satellite (GPS) data and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has shown a smaller life-space (distance traveled from home) was associated with poorer community functioning and more severe negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia. Momentary emotional experiences may influence how much time is spent outside of the home. We evaluated the associations between emotional experiences in relation to life-space among people with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls (HCs). Method(s): 105 participants with schizophrenia and 76 HCs completed in-lab assessments of symptoms, cognition, and functioning. Participants completed EMA assessments of location and emotions seven times daily for seven days at stratified random intervals. GPS coordinates were collected 24 h a day over the 7-day study period. Analyses were performed at the momentary, day, and full week level using mixed effects models and Spearman correlations. Result(s): For HCs, greater happiness was associated with greater concurrent distance traveled away from home as measured by GPS. For participants with schizophrenia, greater anxiety was associated with greater distance traveled away from home and being outside of the home. Less happiness, but not anxiety, was also associated with greater negative symptoms, especially outside the home. Discussion(s): These findings suggest diminished positive emotion is associated with the experience of leaving the home in schizophrenia, but also suggest that anxiety may contribute to avoidance of out of home mobility. Interventions targeting both positive emotions and social anxiety may improve social functioning, and life-space may provide a useful outcome for functional rehabilitation interventions in schizophrenia.Copyright © 2020",Excluded,0.03853576
3289,"Detection of renal dysfunction by point-of-care creatinine testing in patients undergoing peripheral MR angiography. OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to analyze the effectiveness of prestudy questionnaires in identifying at-risk patients and estimate the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), nephrogenic systemic fibrosis risk factors, and other comorbidities in patients scheduled to undergo lower extremity MR angiography (MRA) studies using gadoliniumbased contrast agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patent demographics, comorbidities, contrast type, and point-of-care (POC) serum creatinine values were recorded from the medical records of consecutive patients undergoing lower extremity MRA examinations in a single year. Patients were divided into groups by CKD stage (non-CKD, stage III, stage IV, or stage V) on the basis of estimated glomerular filtration rate values determined from POC creatinine results. Patient awareness of a history of CKD was noted if patients admitted to any form of CKD on prestudy questionnaires. RESULTS. Of 199 patients, 72 patients (36.2%) had stage III CKD, six patients (3.0%) had stage IV CKD, and seven patients (3.5%) had stage V CKD. Comorbidities - including smoking status, transplant status, and presence of diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease - as well as administered contrast type and dosage showed significant differences among the CKD groups (p < 0.05). Only five stage III patients (7%) were aware of any history of renal dysfunction, whereas three stage IV patients (50%) and seven stage V patients (100%) admitted any history of renal dysfunction via questionnaires. CONCLUSION. Compared with POC creatinine testing, a prestudy questionnaire used alone is ineffective in identifying all patients with histories of CKD who are scheduled to undergo gadolinium-based peripheral MRA studies. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded,0.03843039

3291,"Analysis of the seasonal pattern in suicide. BACKGROUND: Suicide has been attributed to social and psychological factors but also to geophysical effects. Of the latter, changes in solar radiation and geomagnetic activities may contribute to the frequency and the seasonal pattern of suicides., METHODS: We studied with a population-based, nationwide analysis all the individuals who committed suicide (n=27,469) in Finland during the period of 1979 to 1999. The daily data on the number of suicides, and the mean and maximum levels of geomagnetic activity were compiled and modelled with Poisson regression using the number of inhabitants in each province as the denominator. Time series analysis of monthly numbers of suicides was carried out using a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure., RESULTS: There was a strong seasonal effect on suicide occurrence (P<0.00001), the risk of suicide being greatest in spring. The seasonal effect was most pronounced when the number of suicides was relatively low. High levels of solar radiation activity were associated with the increased risk of suicide (P=0.00001), but the effect of geomagnetic activity was weak., LIMITATIONS: No individual data on alcohol consumption or mental disorders were available., CONCLUSIONS: Suicide occurrence varies markedly by season and needs attention where prevention is concerned.",Excluded,0.039456494

3293,"Outcomes of Hodgkin's lymphoma patients with relapse or progression following first autologous stem cell transplantation. According to recent retrospective analyses, the median survival of patients (pts) with relapsed/progressed Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) following autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) may exceed 2 years regardless of therapeutic approach. We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of 103 (female: 39, male: 64) pts, who underwent 1st ASCT for HL from September 1990 to November 2008 and relapsed or progressed. Sixty-four pts had been transplanted for refractory disease. The median time to relapse/progression was 5 (0.7-132) months post ASCT, and < 12 months in 77/103 pts. The median age at relapse was 29 (13-67) years. The stage at relapse was advanced (III or IV) in 58, and B-symptoms were present in 26 pts. In 41 pts, progression of disease to additional sites was noted. Salvage treatment was chemotherapy +/- irradiation (R/T) in 75 pts, R/T only in 6, 2nd SCT in 14 (ASCT in 3, and alloSCT with a reduced-intensity regimen in 11), while 2 refused any therapy. Six pts had a positive PET-scan without clinical suggestion of active disease, and did not receive any treatment (watch-and-wait approach). Sixty of the 95 treated pts achieved a complete (38 pts, 40%) or partial (22 pts, 24%) remission. The interval of < 12 months from 1st ASCT to relapse, advanced stage and presence of B-symptoms at relapse, as well as the disease refractoriness before 1st ASCT emerged as significant adverse factors for response rate (P < 0,05 by t-test). The median survival for all pts was 29.5 months. Multivariate analysis revealed late relapse (> 12 months), absence of B-symptoms at relapse and disease sensitivity before 1st ASCT as significant factors for prolonged survival (P < 0.05). The type of treatment had no impact on survival rates. Three of the 14 re-transplanted pts (2 allo- and 1 autografted) are alive (with 2 in CR for 7 and 5 years, respectively). Eight re-transplanted pts succumbed to progressive disease and 3 to treatment related toxicity. Interestingly, all 6 patients managed with the watch-and-wait approach are alive without disease progression for a median of 12 (1.5-45) months. Our results confirm that selected pts with relapsed or progressed HL following ASCT could be rescued with recent treatment modalities. Currently, given the conventional and alternative treatment options, management of relapsed disease post 1st ASCT remains a challenge and prospective studies with large series of pts are needed to establish the appropriate approach.",Excluded,0.038620632

PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to assess the effect of Sinogram Affirmed Iterative Reconstruction (SAFIRE) and filtered back-projection (FBP) techniques on abdominal computed tomography (CT) performed with 50% and 75% radiation dose reductions., METHODS: Twenty-four patients (mean age, 64 +/- 14 years; male-female ratio, 10:14) gave informed consent for an institutional review board-approved prospective study involving acquisition of additional research images through the abdomen on 128-slice multi-detector-row CT (SOMATOM Definition Flash) at quality reference mAs of 100 (50% lower dose) and 50 (75% lower dose) over a scan length of 10 cm using combined modulation (CARE Dose 4D). Standard-of-care abdominal CT was performed at 200 quality reference mAs, with remaining parameters held constant. The 50- and 100-mAs data sets were reconstructed with FBP and at 4 SAFIRE settings (S1, S2, S3, S4). Higher number of SAFIRE settings denotes increased strength of the algorithm resulting in lower image noise. Two abdominal radiologists independently compared the FBP and SAFIRE images for lesion number, location, size and conspicuity, and visibility of small structures, image noise, and diagnostic confidence. Objective noise and Hounsfield units (HU) were measured in the liver and the descending aorta., RESULTS: All 43 lesions were detected on both FBP and SAFIRE images. Minor blocky, pixelated appearance of 50% and 75% reduced dose images was noted at S3 and S4 SAFIRE but not at S1 and S2 settings. Subjective noise was suboptimal in both 50% and 75% lower-dose FBP images but was deemed acceptable on all SAFIRE settings. Sinogram Affirmed Iterative Reconstruction images were deemed acceptable in all patients at 50% lower dose and in 22 of 24 patients at 75% lower dose. As compared with 75% reduced dose FBP, objective noise was lower by 22.8% (22.9/29.7), 35% (19.3/29.7), 44.3% (16.7/29.3), and 54.8% (13.4/29.7) on S1 to S4 settings, respectively (P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Sinogram Affirmed Iterative Reconstruction-enabled reconstruction provides abdominal CT images without loss in diagnostic value at 50% reduced dose and in some patients also at 75% reduced dose.",Excluded,0.038528055
3314,"Mouse spleen lymphocyte bactericidal and peroxidase activities: enhancement by whole body x-irradiation. A 20,000 g pellet obtained from the homogenate of CD1 mouse spleen cells has measurable peroxidase and bactericidal activities. Whole body x-irradiation stimulates the in vitro peroxidative and bactericidal activities of the spleen cells. These cells do not phagocytize. However, addition of polystyrene latex particles to spleen cells from non- or x-irradiated mice, increases glucose oxidation. The extent of this stimulation (three- to fourfold) is less than that of PMN (six- to tenfold). Interaction between particles and lymphocyte surface may be the cause of this stimulation. The increased bactericidal activity due to x-ray is attributed mainly to an increase in the peroxidase activity of the lymphocytes. Surface (membrane) action rather than phagocytosis may be involved in the bactericidal process. The spleen lymphocyte peroxidase is distinct from myeloperoxidase in several respects.",Included,0.9619438
3344,"Irradiation-resistance conferred by superoxide dismutase: possible adaptive role of a natural polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster. The toxic effects of ionizing radiation to DNA are thought to be due to the generation of the superoxide radical, 02-. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), which scavenges 02-., has been invoked as a protecting enzyme against ionizing radiation in viruses, bacteria, mammalian cells in culture, and live mice. We now demonstrate that SOD is involved in the resistance of Drosophila melanogaster against irradiation. The protection is greatest when flies carry the S form of the enzyme (which exhibits highest in vitro specific activity), intermediate when they carry the F form of the enzyme, and lowest when they are homozygous for N, an allele that reduces the amount of the enzyme to 3.5% of the normal level. Natural selection experiments show that the fitness of the high-activity S allele is increased in an irradiated population relative to the nonirradiated control. These results point towards a possible adaptive function of the S/F polymorphism found in natural populations of D. melanogaster.",Included,0.9707254

INTRODUCTION: Radiation therapy (RT) of malignant tumors in the head and neck area may have damaging effects on surrounding tissues. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the long-term effects of ionizing radiation on pulp vitality by measuring pulp oxygenation levels (%SpO2) in patients with history of RT of intraoral and oropharyngeal tumors 4-6 years after treatment., METHODS: In an experimental group RT (n = 90, history of RT) and a control group CON (n = 90, no history of RT), pulp vitality was assessed by measuring %SpO2 by using pulse oximetry and pulp sensitivity by cold thermal testing. All anterior teeth without history of endodontic therapy of the participants in group RT were measured (n = 693), regardless of the quadrant and the irradiated area. An equal number of anterior teeth were tested in group CON., RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the %SpO2 levels in group RT (92.7%; standard deviation, +/- 1.83) and group CON (92.6%; standard deviation, +/- 1.80). All teeth in RT and CON groups showed a positive response to the thermal test. All tested teeth were considered vital., CONCLUSIONS: Pulp %SpO2 was found to be within normal limits 4-6 years after RT. This suggests that RT may not have a long-term influence on pulp vitality, and reported short-term changes in pulpal microcirculation because of RT may be temporary.

Cataractogenesis, which progressed according to the model proposed by Rubin and Casarett (1968), was modified by radiation quality in the following ways. (1) The rate of development of the early (acute) stage increased with the LET infinity of the incident radiation; (2) at the intermediate (plateau) stage, the values for the relative biological effectiveness (r.b.e.) of the heavy ions were similar to those reported for proliferating cells in culture; (3) for a given intermediate level, the onset of late cataractogenesis occurred earlier the higher the LET affinity of the radiation involved.
