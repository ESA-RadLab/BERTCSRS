350,"Translocation analysis by the FISH-painting method for retrospective dose reconstruction in individuals exposed to ionizing radiation 10 years after exposure Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful method largely used for detecting chromosomal rearrangements, translocations in particular, which are important biomarkers for dose assessment in case of human exposure to ionizing radiation. To test the possibility of using the translocation analysis by FISH-painting method in retrospective dose assessment, we carried out in vitro experiments in irradiated human lymphocytes, in parallel with the analysis of translocations in lymphocytes from 10 individuals, who were exposed to 137cesium in the Goiania (Brazil) accident (samples collected 10 years after exposure). The in vitro dose-response curve for the genomic translocation frequencies (FGs) fits a linear quadratic model, according to the equation: Y=0.0243X2+0.0556X. The FG values were also calculated for the individuals exposed to 137cesium, ranging from 0.58 to 5.91 per 100 cells, and the doses were estimated and compared with the results obtained by dicentric analysis soon after the accident, taking the opportunity to test the validity of translocation analysis in retrospective biodosimetry. A tentative of retrospective dosimetry was performed, indicating that the method is feasible only for low level exposure (below 0.5Gy), while for higher doses there is a need to apply appropriate correction factors, which take into consideration mainly the persistence of chromosomal translocations along with time, and the influence of endogenous and exogenous factors determining the inter-individual variability in the cellular responses to radiation. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

116,"Dose Estimation Curves Following In Vitro X-ray Irradiation Using Blood From Four Healthy Korean Individuals Cytogenetic dosimetry is useful for evaluating the absorbed dose of ionizing radiation based on analysis of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations. We created two types of in vitro dose-response calibration curves for dicentric chromosomes (DC) and translocations (TR) induced by X-ray irradiation, using an electron linear accelerator, which is the most frequently used medical device in radiotherapy. We irradiated samples from four healthy Korean individuals and compared the resultant curves between individuals. Aberration yields were studied in a total of 31,800 and 31,725 metaphases for DC and TR, respectively, obtained from 11 X-ray irradiation dose-points (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Gy). The dose-response relationship followed a linear-quadratic equation, Y=C+alphaD+betaD2, with the coefficients C=0.0011 for DC and 0.0015 for TR, alpha=0.0119 for DC and 0.0048 for TR, and beta=0.0617 for DC and 0.0237 for TR. Correlation coefficients between irradiation doses and chromosomal aberrations were 0.971 for DC and 0.6 for TR, indicating a very strong and a moderate correlation, respectively. This is the first study implementing cytogenetic dosimetry following exposure to ionizing X-radiation. Copyright © The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine.",Excluded,0.96160465
802,"Sex-specific differences in fetal germ cell apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that male human fetal germ cells are highly radiosensitive and that their death depends on p53 activation. Male germ cell apoptosis was initiated with doses as low as 0.1 Gy and was prevented by pifithrin alpha, a p53 inhibitor. In this study, we investigated the radiosensitivity of early female and male fetal proliferating germ cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Both male and female fetal germ cells displayed a similar number of gamma H2AX foci in response to ionizing radiation (IR). In organ culture of human fetal ovaries, the germ cells underwent apoptosis only when exposed to high doses of IR (1.5 Gy and above). Accumulation of p53 was detected in irradiated male human fetal germ cells but not in female ones. Inhibition of p53 with pifithrin alpha did not affect oogonia apoptosis following irradiation. IR induced apoptosis similarly in mouse fetal ovaries in organ culture and in vivo during oogonial proliferation. Germ cell survival in testes from p53 knockout or p63 knockout mice exposed to IR was better than wild-type, whereas female germ cell survival was unaffected by p53 or p63 knockout.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that pre-meiotic male and female fetal germ cells behave differently in response to a genotoxic stress--irradiation--with oogonia being less sensitive and undergoing p53-independent apoptosis.",Excluded,0.9615955
31,"Chromosome aberrations induced by tritiated water or 60Co gamma-rays at early pronuclear stage in mouse eggs The induction of chromosome aberrations in mouse eggs by exposure to HTO beta-particles and 60Co gamma-rays at the early pronuclear stage was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase by using an in vitro fertilization technique. Eggs at the pronuclear stage were exposed to beta-particles in a chemically defined medium containing tritiated water (HTO) for 2 h at 3-5 h after insemination. Other eggs at the same stage were exposed to gamma-rays from 60Co during the same period. The dose-response relationships for frequencies of chromosome aberrations per egg were fitted to a linear-quadratic model for HTO beta-particles, and to a linear model for 60Co gamma-rays. The chromosome aberrations were mainly chromosome-type, and the majority of all aberrations were fragments. RBE values of HTO beta-particles relative to 60Co gamma-rays and acute X-rays, which were estimated from the ratio of the linear regression coefficients over 0.05-Gy range, were 2.0 and 1.6, respectively.",Excluded,0.9615849
882,"Chromosome anomalies in mouse oocytes after irradiation We investigated the cytogenetic effects of X-rays on unfertilized mouse oocytes. NMRI females received an irradiation with 0,22.2,66.6,200, and 600 R during the preovulatory phase 3 hrs after HCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin). This is a stage during oogenesis in which the oocytes pass from late dictyotene to diakinesis. Chromosome analysis was performed after ovulation at metaphase II. From these experiments we can draw the following conclusions: 1) X-rays induced during the preovulatory phase a high number of chromosome anomalies. Among these, structural anomalies prevail. 7 out of 144 ovulated oocytes in matched controls carried such an abnormality, whereas after irradiation we observed with 22.2, 66.6, 200, and 600 R, 11 out of 72, 34 out of 108, 89 out of 102, and 122 out of 124, respectively. 2) Irradiation seems also to affect the chromosome segregation during the 1. meiotic division, as we observed after 22.2, 66.6, and 200 R a total of 6 oocytes out of 204 with a supernummary chromosome. In controls, however, no hyperploidy was found in 143 ova. This increase, however, was not significant. 3) Chromosome anomalies, e.g. breaks and deletions that go back to a one-break event increased linearly with increasing dose. Exchanges, however, going back to two-break events fittest best to the linear-quadratic dose-response model. 4) The dose of 600 R seems to represents a kind of borderline in this experiment, because nearly all (122 out 124) carried at least one structural chromosome anomaly. It is also this dose after which the highest frequency of reciprocal translocations was observed in a hump-shaped slope in spermatocytes after irradiation of spermatogonia (Preston and Brewen, 1973). With an increasing dosage up to 1200 R the frequency of translocations decrease again. The elimination of cells, crossing this borderline, might be due to genetic or non-genetic effects. 5) The frequency of radiation-induced translocations per oocyte agrees with the frequency of translocations in human lymphocytes (Dolphin and Lloyd, 1974) after in vitro irradiation. 6) Significant, lower frequencies of structural chromosome anomalies were observed irradiating earlier stages of mouse oogenesis. These stages are dictyotene from females at the age of 3, or 6 weeks and prophase I-stages in female embryos on the 17th day of gestation. This result may be due to a lower sensitivity of these stages or to modifying events during the interval between irradiation and preparations.",Excluded,0.96157986
432,"DNA alterations detected in the progeny of paternally irradiated Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) A nonmammalian test system for germ-cell mutagenesis has been developed by using the Japanese medaka fish. We describe a system for detecting DNA alterations in F1 progeny descended from the gamma-irradiated male medaka that uses an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction and fingerprinting. A combination of these two methods has some advantages for screening changes in genomic DNA of individual progeny because this detection system can (i) screen for mutational events before embryos with dominant lethal mutations are eliminated during development and (ii) detect DNA changes in the progeny of irradiated males without functional selection and bias, such as resistance to chemicals. DNA alterations are detected as changes in patterns (i.e., band loss and/or band gain) of DNA fingerprints of progeny descended from males whose spermatozoa or spermatids were gamma-irradiated (4.75 or 9.50 Gy). We determined the frequency of gamma-irradiation-induced band loss in arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction fingerprints of DNA from severely malformed embryos with dominant lethal mutations and hatched viable embryos. The frequency of band loss in both dominant lethal embryos and hatched viable embryos increased with increasing gamma-ray dose, although more so in the former. We detected a new band in the fingerprints as a heritable DNA alteration but not a viability- or phenotype-affecting DNA alteration in two viable mutants recovered after gamma-irradiation experiments. A cloned amplified fragment of the new band contained a repeated sequence of p(ATGT)n.",Excluded,0.9615681
844,"Induction of malformations by X-ray exposure of various stages of the oogenesis of mice We studied the effects of ionizing radiation (X-rays, 0-3 Gy, dose rate 1 Gy/min) on various stages of oogenesis of a mouse strain (HLG/Zte) that had been shown previously to respond with an increased number of malformations after radiation exposure of preimplantation stages. Like the results obtained with preimplantation stages, we observed a statistically significant increase in the number of malformed fetuses (exclusively gastroschises) on day 19 of gestation, when oocytes within 1-4 weeks before ovulation were exposed to 2 or 3 Gy. Less mature oocytes were killed by radiation doses of 0.5 Gy and higher. In addition to the increased frequency of malformations, we found a dose-dependent increase of lethal effects (affecting either oocytes or specific gestational stages) and of runts ('dwarfs').",Excluded,0.9615678
725,"Multivariate analysis of low-dose radiation-associated changes in cytokine gene expression profiles using microarray technology OBJECTIVE: The availability of microarray technology, which permits evaluation of the entire cellular transcriptome in a single experiment, has provided new insights on the function of the genome under normal and pathological conditions, as well as in response to genotoxic stimuli, including ionizing radiation. The aims of this study were to: 1) determine whether specific cytokine gene expression profiles can be delineated in individuals exposed to chronic, low-dose radiation; and 2) compare analyses from three multivariate analytic methodologies, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), and projection pursuit (PP), in evaluating transcriptional responses in human mononuclear cells to low doses of ionizing radiation (IR), as determined by cDNA microarrays., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total RNA isolated from mononuclear cells of 19 apparently healthy adult individuals exposed to low doses of IR ranging from 0.18 mSv to 49 mSv over a period of 11 to 13 years, as a result of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant catastrophe, was reverse transcribed in the presence of radioactive dATP to generate radiolabeled complementary cDNA. Target cDNA was hybridized to human cytokine and receptor arrays and mRNA transcriptional patterns were evaluated using HCA, PCA, and PP., RESULTS: Statistical analyses of the data generated from 19 microarrays revealed distinct gene expression patterns in mononuclear cells of individuals exposed to radiation doses of greater than 10 mSv or less than 10 mSv. Genes encompassed within clusters discerned by HCA, PCA, and PP varied depending on the methodology used to analyze the microarray data. The most frequently expressed genes across all radiation doses were serine/threonine protein kinase receptor (11/19), transforming growth factor (TGF) receptor (11/19), EB13 (10/19), and CD40 ligand., CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings suggest that it may be possible to assign gene expression profiles to low-dose-irradiated individuals, we show that gene expression profiles vary, depending on the statistical method used to analyze the data. Since there is, as of yet, no consensus regarding the best method to analyze a multivariate dataset, and since discarding the raw data and repeating the experiment at a later date constitutes an unwarranted expenditure, it is important to submit microarray data to public databases where these data can be reevaluated and interpreted by investigators holding expertise in various fields within the scientific community, including radiation biology, statistics, and bioinformatics.",Excluded,0.9615667
133,"[Adaptive response of blood lymphocytes as a marker of hemopoiesis status in exposed persons] An obvious correlation between the type of reaction manifested by peripheral blood lymphocytes to low dose irradiation in vitro (adaptive potential), the RBM cell composition (during the period of the major exposure), and the peripheral blood cell composition (at a late time period coincident with the studies of induced radioresistance) has been found in the Techa riverside residents in the later periods after the onset of a long-term low-dose rate radiation exposure (55-60 years later) within a range of individual red bone marrow doses from 0.01 to 1.79 Gy. The nature of these dependences observed in chronically exposed individuals differs from that revealed in the controls. It can be suggested based on the results of the study that the capacity for the adaptive response shown by peripheral blood lymphocytes donated by exposed persons in the remote period after exposure can be regarded as a biological marker of the functional state of the hemopoietic stem cell pool.",Excluded,0.9615645

The contraction was either reversible, semireversible or persistent, and the basal muscle tone was elevated. A tachyphylactic reaction was observed. The phasic activity of the preparations was temporarily increased, then inhibited after irradiation.

174,"Profiles of non-cancer diseases in atomic bomb survivors This article summarizes the results of a recent study of atomic bomb radiation and non-cancer diseases in the AHS (Adult Health Study) population by the RERF (Radiation Effects Research Foundation) along with a general discussion of previous studies. The association of atomic bomb radiation and CVD was examined by incidence studies and prevalence studies of various endpoints of atherosclerosis, such as MI, stroke, aortic arch calcification, isolated systolic hypertension, and pulse wave velocity, and, although the excess was small, all endpoints indicated an increase of CVD in the heavily exposed group. Because of the consistency of the results, it is almost certain that CVD is higher among atomic bomb survivors. However, all CVD risk factors associated with lifestyle had not necessarily been adjusted for in studies to date, and it is difficult at present to conclude that the increase in CVD among survivors was a direct effect of radiation. Recent studies have demonstrated almost certainly that uterine myoma is more frequent among atomic bomb survivors. It cannot, at present, be concluded that uterine myoma is caused by radiation, because there are no reported studies of other exposed populations. Further analyses including the role of confounding factors as well as molecular approaches are needed to verify this radiation effect. The relationship between atomic bomb radiation exposure and hyperparathyroidism can now be said to have been established in view of the strong dose response, the agreement with results of studies of other populations, the high risk in the younger survivors, and the biological plausibility. Future studies by molecular approaches, etc., are needed to determine the pathogenic mechanism. Among other benign tumours, a dose response has been demonstrated for tumours of the thyroid, stomach and ovary. Although fewer studies have been conducted than for cancer, a clear association between radiation and various benign tumours is emerging. Concerning the association between atomic bomb radiation exposure and chronic liver diseases, the recent incidence study of members of the AHS population demonstrated a significant dose response. Both chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis were suggested as being associated with exposure. The possibility that the increased occurrence of chronic liver diseases among the survivors may be due to hepatitis virus infection cannot be excluded, and the results of the ongoing hepatitis C virus antibody titre studies are awaited.",Excluded,0.96155274
828,"Gamma-H2AX-based dose estimation for whole and partial body radiation exposure Most human exposures to ionising radiation are partial body exposures. However, to date only limited tools are available for rapid and accurate estimation of the dose distribution and the extent of the body spared from the exposure. These parameters are of great importance for emergency triage and clinical management of exposed individuals. Here, measurements of gamma-H2AX immunofluorescence by microscopy and flow cytometry were compared as rapid biodosimetric tools for whole and partial body exposures. Ex vivo uniformly X-irradiated blood lymphocytes from one donor were used to generate a universal biexponential calibration function for gamma-H2AX foci/intensity yields per unit dose for time points up to 96 hours post exposure. Foci--but not intensity--levels remained significantly above background for 96 hours for doses of 0.5 Gy or more. Foci-based dose estimates for ex vivo X-irradiated blood samples from 13 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered to the targeted samples. Flow cytometric dose estimates for X-irradiated blood samples from 8 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered at 1 hour post exposure but less so at 24 hours post exposure. In partial body exposures, simulated by mixing ex vivo irradiated and unirradiated lymphocytes, foci/intensity distributions were significantly over-dispersed compared to uniformly irradiated lymphocytes. For both methods and in all cases the estimated fraction of irradiated lymphocytes and dose to that fraction, calculated using the zero contaminated Poisson test and gamma-H2AX calibration function, were in good agreement with the actual mixing ratios and doses delivered to the samples. In conclusion, gamma-H2AX analysis of irradiated lymphocytes enables rapid and accurate assessment of whole body doses while dispersion analysis of foci or intensity distributions helps determine partial body doses and the irradiated fraction size in cases of partial body exposures.",Excluded,0.9615504
1034,"Variant Splicing and Influence of Ionizing Radiation on Human Endogenous Retrovirus K (HERV-K) Transcripts in Cancer Cell Lines Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) is the most intact retrovirus in the human genome. There are multiple full-length or near full-length HERV-K proviruses in it. To analyze which HERV-K proviruses give rise to viral transcripts in cancer cell lines and to test whether ionizing radiation can alter the levels of HERV-K transcripts, RT-PCR studies were undertaken using multiple human cancer cell lines. Primers from several positions in the viral genome were used and included pairs designed to cross splice junctions in viral RNAs. In the absence of ionizing radiation, transcripts were detected from multiple HERV-K proviruses in cell lines from human prostate, cervical, head and neck, or breast cancers, and the proviruses from which the transcripts originated varied among the different lines. Only one of 13 cell lines tested (cervical cancer line C33A) failed to show HERV-K transcripts. Spliced RNAs detected included viral RNAs spliced as expected at the conventional viral splice sites, plus several alternatively spliced RNAs. Alternatively spliced transcripts arose from specific proviruses, and were detected in most of the cell lines used. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to assess the effects of ionizing radiation. These analyses showed that HERV-K transcripts were elevated in four of twelve lines tested, specifically all three prostate cancer lines used and one breast cancer line. The increases were transient, peaking at 24 hours following a single dose of gamma-irradiation that ranged from 2.5 to 20 Gy, and returning to baseline levels by 72 hours. In summary, these studies showed that ionizing radiation can affect the levels of HERV-K transcripts in cells, and these effects vary among different cells. The changes in HERV-K transcript levels might affect multiple biological processes in cells, and future studies of the effects of ionizing radiation on HERV-K are worth pursuing. © 2013 Agoni et al.",Excluded,0.961543

143,"Telomere stability correlates with longevity of human beings exposed to ionizing radiations Normal somatic cells have a finite number of divisions, a limited capacity to proliferate. Human telomeres contain TTAGGG repeats which are considered a molecular clock marker. The gradual and progressive telomere shortening at each replicative cycle is associated, through the activation of pRB and p53 pathways and genomic instability, to the replicative senescence, a non-dividing state and widespread cell death. There is no information available about telomere status in individuals who live long and have been exposed to ionizing radiations (IR). To determine the telomere stability, we examined telomeres at metaphase, G2-type chromosome aberrations after IR treatment and karyotypic analysis of 15 individuals. Three individuals were above the age of 80 years and 1 among the 3 was estimated to have received more than 10 Gy of occupational exposure about 30 years back. The other 12 were cancer patients that had received more than 50 Gy of gamma-radiation for therapeutic purposes. No telomere instability or defective G2 chromosome repair was found in 3 individuals above the age of 80 years. Whereas, 3 out of 7 prostate and 1 out of 5 breast cancer patients showed higher G2-type chromosome damage as well as a high frequency of telomeric association (also known as chromosome end associations) along with frequent loss of telomeres. Present studies demonstrate that telomere stability along with normal G2 chromosome repair correlates with the longevity of human beings, whereas defective G2 chromosome repair and telomere instability correlate with the radiotherapy related late toxicity.",Excluded,0.96153057
630,"Exposure of patients to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional imaging and procedures: Dose estimation and analysis of gamma-H2AX foci and gene expression in blood lymphocytes Radiation has widespread applications in medicine. However, despite the benefits of medical radiation exposures, adverse long-term health effects are cause for concern. Protein and gene biomarkers are early indicators of cellular response after low-dose exposure. We examined DNA damage by quantifying gamma-H2AX foci and expression of twelve candidate genes in the blood lymphocytes of patients exposed to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional procedures. Entrance surface dose (ESD; 10.92-1062.55 mGy) was measured by thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD). Absorbed dose was estimated using gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression, with in vitro dose-response curves generated for the same biomarkers. gamma-H2AX foci in post-exposure samples were significantly higher than in pre-exposure samples. Among the genes analysed, FDXR, ATM, BCL2, MDM2, TNFSF9, and PCNA showed increased expression; CDKN1A, DDB2, SESN1, BAX, and TNFRSF10B showed unchanged or decreased expression. Absorbed dose, estimated based on gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression changes, did not show any correlation with measured ESD. Patients undergoing interventional procedures receive considerable radiation doses, resulting in DNA damage and altered gene expression. Medical procedures should be carried out using the lowest radiation doses possible without compromising treatment. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.9615289
1004,"A comparison of in vivo cellular responses to CS-137 gamma rays and 320-KV X rays Research reported here relates to comparing the relative effectiveness of 320-kV X rays compared to Cs-137 gamma rays for two in vivo endpoints in C.B-17 mice after whole-body exposure: (1) cytotoxicity to bone marrow cells and splenocytes evaluated at 24-hours post exposure and (2) bone marrow and spleen reconstitution deficits (repopulation shortfalls) evaluated at 6 weeks post exposure. We show that cytotoxicity dose-response relationships for bone marrow cells and splenocytes are complex, involving negative curvature (decreasing slope as dose increases), presumably implicating a mixed cell population comprised of large numbers of hypersensitive, modestly radiosensitive, and resistant cells. The radiosensitive cells appear to respond with 50% being killed by a dose < 0.5 Gy. The X-ray relative biological effectiveness (RBE), relative to gamma rays, for destroying bone marrow cells in vivo is > 1, while for destroying splenocytes it is < 1.

1024,"Effect of gamma radiation on the biology of the flesh fly, Parasarcophaga argyrostoma. I. Following larval exposure One and seven days old larvae of the flesh fly, Parasarcophaga argyrostoma were exposed to doses ranging from 1-90 Gy. Lower doses ranging from 1-9 Gy applied to young larvae accelerate larval development whereas old larvae responded to doses from 10-90 Gy by a remarkable retardation of the larval and pupal development. Reduction in percentage pupation and adult emergence were noticed with increment in the radiation doses applied. This reduction was higher for irradiated seven days old larvae than the one day old larvae at all doses applied, indicating that young larvae were more susceptible to gamma radiation than the older one. At higher doses (30-70 Gy) the pupae could not continue their development and died within 17 days after pupation. The longevity of adults resulted from irradiated larvae was decreased by increasing the radiation dosage and it was found that adults emerging from irradiated young larvae lived shorter than those from irradiated young ones, the fecundity of adults resulted from irradiated larvae was also decreased by gamma irradiation exposures.

51,"Effects of different gamma exposure regimes on reproduction in the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Oligochaeta) Ecological risk assessment of ionising radiation requires knowledge about the responses of individuals and populations to chronic exposures, including situations when exposure levels change over time. The present study investigated processes such as recovery and the adaptive response with respect to reproduction endpoints in the earthworm Eisenia fetida exposed to (60)Co gamma-radiation. Furthermore, a crossed experiment was performed to investigate the influence of F0 parental and F1 embryonic irradiation history on the response of irradiated or non-irradiated F1 offspring. Recovery: The sterility induced by sub-chronic exposure at 17 m Gy/h (accumulated dose: 25 Gy) was temporary, and 8 weeks after irradiation the worms had regained their reproductive capacity (number of viable offspring produced per adult per week). Adaptive response: Adult worms were continuously exposed at a low priming dose rate of 0.14 mGy/h for 12 weeks (accumulated dose: 0.24 Gy), followed by 14 weeks exposure at a challenge dose rate of 11 mGy/h. The results suggest a lack of adaptive response, since there were no significant differences in the effects on reproduction capacity between the primed and the unprimed groups after challenge doses ranging from 7.6 to 27 Gy. Crossed experiment: The effects of exposure at 11 mGy/h for 21 weeks on growth, sexual maturation and reproduction of offspring, derived either from parent worms and cocoons both exposed at 11 mGy/h, or from non-irradiated parents and cocoons (total accumulated dose 44 and 38 Gy, respectively) were compared. There were no significant differences between the two exposed offspring groups for any of the endpoints. The reproduction capacity was very low for both groups compared to the controls, but the reproduction seemed to be maintained at the reduced level, which could indicate acclimatisation or stabilisation. Finally, parental and embryonic exposures at 11 mGy/h did not affect reproduction in the F1 offspring as adults. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.9615051

To explore if cocarcinogenesis would affect the incidence of tumour on implants, we tested several physical (asbestos, beta irradiation) and chemical (acridine orange, phorbol methyl ester, cigarette smoke tar, extract of Agaricus bisporus mushroom) carcinogens on 25 mm diameter nitrocellulose filters implanted in groups of BALB/c mice in 9 experiments. Saline was applied in 287 concurrent controls. Irradiation by 540 kBq I-125 fibrinogen on foreign bodies of surface area 20sq cm induced tumour in 6/6 pilot animals (expected 2/6) and in 25/36 animals (controls 13/29; p < 0.04). The mean dose (beta and gamma) to cells within 20 mum of the filter surface was estimated to be 782 mGy. Exposures to 270kBq or less were not significantly cocarcinogenic with single implants. Radiation from the paired implants was detectible up to 80 weeks. Asbestos, however, 2.3 or 4.6 mgm on implants did not in 3 trials increase sarcoma yield significantly, but did induce mesothelial-type growths in the peritoneum. Asbestos (2.3 mg) injected without an implant provoked no tumour at the site. The chemical carcinogen acridine orange gave ambiguous results, and the others reduced tumour incidence insignificantly.

413,"Soft-tissue allografts terminally sterilized with an electron beam are biomechanically equivalent to aseptic, nonsterilized tendons BACKGROUND: Allograft safety is contingent on effective sterilization. However, current sterilization methods have been associated with decreased biomechanical strength and higher failure rates of soft-tissue allografts. In this study, electron beam (e-beam) sterilization was explored as an alternative sterilization method to preserve biomechanical integrity. We hypothesized that e-beam sterilization would not significantly alter the biomechanical properties of tendon allograft compared with aseptic, nonsterilized controls and gamma-irradiated grafts., METHODS: Separate sets of forty fresh-frozen tibialis tendon allografts (four from each of ten donors) and forty bisected bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) allografts (four from each of ten donors) were randomly assigned to four study groups. One group received a 17.1 to 21.0-kGy gamma radiation dose; two other groups were sterilized with an e-beam at either a high (17.1 to 21.0-kGy) or low (9.2 to 12.2-kGy) dose. A fourth group served as nonsterilized controls. Each graft was cyclically loaded to 200 N of tension for 2000 cycles at a frequency of 2 Hz, allowed to relax for five minutes, and then tested in tension until failure at a 100%/sec strain rate. One-way analysis of variance testing was used to identify significant differences., RESULTS: Tibialis tendons sterilized with both e-beam treatments and with gamma irradiation exhibited values for cyclic tendon elongation, maximum load, maximum displacement, stiffness, maximum stress, maximum strain, and elastic modulus that were not significantly different from those of nonsterilized controls. BTB allografts sterilized with the high e-beam dose and with gamma irradiation were not significantly different in cyclic tendon elongation, maximum load, maximum displacement, stiffness, maximum stress, maximum strain, and elastic modulus from nonsterilized controls. BTB allografts sterilized with the e-beam at the lower dose were significantly less stiff than nonsterilized controls (p = 0.014) but did not differ from controls in any other properties. The difference in stiffness likely resulted from variations in tendon size rather than the treatments, as the elastic moduli of the groups were similar., CONCLUSIONS: The biomechanical properties of tibialis and BTB allografts sterilized with use of an e-beam at a dose range of 17.1 to 21.0 kGy were not different from those of aseptic, nonsterilized controls or gamma-irradiated allografts., CLINICAL RELEVANCE: E-beam sterilization can be a viable method to produce safe and biomechanically uncompromised soft-tissue allografts.

Among the 47 recessive lethals, no two-break aberrations were detected in 48.9% of the lethals, deletions were associated with 42.2%, inversions with 6.7% and translocations with 2.2%.-When these genetic results are compared to those for 250 KV X-rays, the mutation rate for betatron treatments was slightly lower (.76), the recessive lethal rate among induced mutations was higher, and the chromosome aberrations among lethal mutations were slightly lower than with 250 KV X-rays. Although the two types of irradiations differ by an ion density of approximately ten, the amount and types of inheritable genetic damage induced by the two radiations in mature sperm were not significantly different.",Excluded,0.9614922

The diets were either untreated (negative control diets) or irradiated at 1, 2.5 and 5 megarad and were freshly irradiated, or stored. The animals were fed their test diets for a period of 3 weeks prior to mating. Groups of mice given a single intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg cyclophosphamide per kg body weight served as the positive controls. Freshly irradiated PRD diet fed to male mice of both strains caused an increase in early deaths in females mated to the males in week 7 and to a lesser extent in week 4. The increase due to irradiation was small by comparison with that produced by the positive control compound. The responses for the other irradiated diets showed no significant increases in early deaths although some values for Oakes diet were high. The effect of storage was examined with PRD and BPN diet on one occasion and produced conflicting results. Thus there was some evidence that irradiated PRD diet has weak mutagenic activity in the meiotic and/or pre-meiotic phase of the spermatogenic cycle which appeared to be lessened on storage; the inclusion of such a diet in toxicological studies would therefore need to be carefully considered.",Excluded,0.96148646

Our preliminary results show a decrease statistically significant in fertility of irradiated groups, but cytogenetic analysis did not shown any inherited damage attributed to radiation.

225,"Changes in X-ray sensitivity of mouse eggs from fertilization to the early pronuclear stage, and their repair capacity To study the changes in radiosensitivity of male and female genomes from fertilization to the pronuclear stage, the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase in eggs fertilized with X-irradiated sperm, in eggs X-irradiated at the mature oocyte stage immediately before fertilization, and in fertilized eggs exposed to X-rays at various stages before DNA synthesis (1-5 h after insemination). Gametic treatment, fertilization and embryo culture were carried out in vitro. Most of the induced chromosome aberrations were chromosome-type aberrations, the frequency of chromosome fragments being the highest, followed by chromosome exchanges in both sperm and oocytes. The induction of chromosome-type aberrations was much higher in oocytes than in sperm. Chromosome-type aberrations were the main type also in fertilized eggs irradiated at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. The radiosensitivity increased gradually with pronuclear formation (1-4h after insemination), but little difference in radiosensitivity was observed between eggs irradiated at 4 h and 5 h, corresponding to the stage when pronuclear formation was complete. The drastic change with pronuclear formation was found not only in radiosensitivity but also in the frequency of chromosome aberrations. The frequency of chromosome-type exchanges decreased drastically 2 h after insemination, and exchanges were barely observed at 5 h. The difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes also markedly changed with pronuclear formation, the chromosome aberration induction in the female genome being much higher than that in the male genome before accomplishment of pronuclear formation. The analysis of potentiation effects of 3-aminobenzamide and caffeine on the yield of X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations demonstrated that the increase of radiosensitivity and the decrease of chromosome-type exchange induction with pronuclear formation, may be closely correlated with alterations in chromatin configuration in the pronuclei and in repair capacity of fertilized eggs at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. No evidence based on repair efficiency was found for the marked difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes during pronuclear formation.",Excluded,0.96148074

608,"Telomere length in human adults and high level natural background radiation BACKGROUND: Telomere length is considered as a biomarker of aging, stress, cancer. It has been associated with many chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Although, telomere shortening due to ionizing radiation has been reported in vitro, no in vivo data is available on natural background radiation and its effect on telomere length. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The present investigation is an attempt to determine the telomere length among human adults residing in high level natural radiation areas (HLNRA) and the adjacent normal level radiation areas (NLNRA) of Kerala coast in Southwest India. Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 310 individuals (HLNRA: N = 233 and NLNRA: N = 77). Telomere length was determined using real time q-PCR. Both telomere (T) and single copy gene (S) specific primers were used to calculate the relative T/S and expressed as the relative telomere length. The telomere length was determined to be 1.22+/-0.15, 1.12+/-0.15, 1.08+/-0.08, 1.12+/-0.11, respectively, among the four dose groups (</=1.50, 1.51-3.00, 3.01-5.00 and >5.00 mGy per year), which did not show any dose response. The results suggested that the high level natural chronic radiation did not have significant effect on telomere length among young adult population living in HLNRA, which is indicative of better repair of telomeric ends. No significant difference in telomere length was observed between male and female individuals. In the present investigation, although the determination of telomere length was studied among the adults with an age group between 18 to 40 years (mean maternal age: 26.10+/-4.49), a negative correlation was observed with respect to age. However, inter-individual variation was (0.81-1.68) was clearly observed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In this preliminary investigation, we conclude that elevated level of natural background radiation has no significant effect on telomere length among the adult population residing in HLNRAs of Kerala coast. To our knowledge, this is the first report from HLNRAs of the world where telomere length was determined on human adults. However, more samples from each background dose group and samples from older population need to be studied to derive firm conclusions.",Excluded,0.9614758
954,"High incidence of mosaic mutations induced by irradiating paternal germ cells of the medaka fish, Oryzias latipes Delayed-type mutations induced by radiation have recently been demonstrated in various somatic-cell systems. Such mutations are thought to result from the transmission of genetic instability through many cell divisions subsequent to a single exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, we have examined whether 'transgenerational' delayed-type mutations can arise during embryonic development of the medaka fish as a result of exposing the sperm and spermatids of live fish to 137 Cs gamma-radiation. To do this, we made use of a sensitive specific-locus test (SLT) for the medaka that we have recently developed. Because the medaka has a transparent egg membrane and embryo body, both visible mosaics and whole-body mutations can be detected during development at an early-expressed pigmentation locus. When wild-type +/+ males were gamma-irradiated and then mated with wl/wl females, the frequency of F1 embryos with both wild-type orange leucophores (wl/+) and mutant-type white leucophores (wl/wl*) (mosaic mutants) was about 5.7 x 10-3/Gy. The frequency of embryos with only white leucophores (whole-body mutants) was about 1.3 x 10-3/Gy. These results suggest that delayed mutations frequently arise in medaka fish embryos that have been fertilized with irradiated sperm. Some possible mechanisms involved in the generation of these delayed mutational events (including genomic instability in the early embryos) are discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded,0.96146214

Full grown pupae of the wax moth, Galleria mellonella were irradiated with 80 and 160 Gy of gamma irradiation. The size of the testes was decreased by increasing of gamma irradiation dose. Also, the size of the testes was decreased in F 1 males comparing with the size of the testes of both the parents and the untreated control. The effects of gamma rays on the DNA patterns of adult male parents and F 1 males showed alterations among the controls, the treated parents and F 1 individuals.

By a conservative estimate, about three per cent of the pre-1987 cancer deaths of Hanford workers had occupational exposures to external radiation as the critical (induction) event. These radiogenic cancers were evenly distributed between five diagnostic groups, but as a result of there being much greater sensitivity to cancer induction by radiation"" after, rather than before, 50 years of age, they were concentrated among the cancers which proved fatal after 70 years of age. The reanalysis provides no support for the idea that radiation is more likely to cause leukemia than solid tumors, or the idea that there is reduced cancer effectiveness of radiation at low dose levels (dose rate effectiveness factor or DREF hypothesis), but the estimated proportion of radiogenic cancers was much higher for the 175 nonfatal cancers (which had other certified causes of death) than for the 1,732 fatal cases. Finally, according to the latest publication of the US Committee on Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR V), dose rate is more important than exposure age, and even a single exposure to 10 rem would only increase the normal cancer risk by four percent. Nevertheless, for all recorded exposures of Hanford workers, the estimated doubling dose was close to 26 rem; for exposures after 58 years, it was close to 5 rem, and for exposures after 62 years, it was less than 1 rem.""",Excluded,0.961408

Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity. To do so, hepatotoxicity was induced in rats by intraperitoneal administration of lead nitrate (7.5 mg/kg) thrice weekly for two consecutive weeks and/or a whole-body gamma-irradiation at a single dose of 6 Gy. Activated PRP (0.5 ml/kg) was injected subcutaneously 24 h after the last dose of lead nitrate and/or gamma-irradiation and continued twice weekly for three successive weeks. Lead nitrate intoxication and/or gamma-irradiation resulted in a significant elevation of serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities accompanied with a significant decrease in serum levels of total protein and albumin. Further, a significant increase in malondialdehyde level and nitric oxide content accompanied with a significant decrease in the reduced glutathione content and the enzyme activities of glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were observed. Additionally, hepatic extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling pathways were stimulated. PRP treatment notably ameliorated the induced cell injury, reduced the intracellular oxidative and interestingly increased the upregulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Akt. Moreover, PRP treatment relieved lead nitrate and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatic histological damages. In conclusion, this study sheds the light on a probable therapeutic role of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity which might attribute to its ability to activate ERK and Akt signaling pathways.",Excluded,0.96138376

Further data on differences between Canton-S and ebony strains with respect to maternal effects for the X-ray induction of autosomal translocations and ring-X chromosome losses in mature spermatozoa The influence of the maternal genotype (Canton-S, proficient in the repair of X-ray-induced chromosome breaks and ebony, less proficient in this regard) on the recovery of X-ray-induced autosomal (II-III) translocations and ring-X chromosome losses in mature spermatozoa was studied. In the first series of experiments, males carrying appropriate markers on their second and third chromosomes were irradiated and mated to Canton-S or ebony females and the frequencies of II-III translocations were determined. In the second series of experiments, males carrying ring-X chromosomes were irradiated in N2 or in O2, mated to Canton-S or ebony females and the frequencies of XO males were determined; additionally, under similar gas-treatment and radiation conditions, the pattern of egg-mortality was also assessed. The data on translocations show that the yields are higher with ebony than with Canton-S females; these and earlier results on dominant lethals and sex-linked recessive lethals support the interpretation that the maternal repair system in the ebony strain is less proficient and more error-prone than that of the Canton-S strain. Those on the losses of ring-X chromosomes demonstrate that (i) the absolute yields of XO males are lower with ebony than with Canton-S females irrespective of whether the parental males are irradiated in N2 or in O2; (ii) the exposure-frequency relationships are all linear, but the slopes are higher when the males are irradiated in O2 and are consistent with an oxygen-enhancement-ratio of about 1.5 and (iii) the relationships between the logarithm of egg-survival and XO male frequency are also linear, but the slopes for the O2 groups are lower than those for the N2 groups (slope ratios of 0.86-0.87). The finding that at given survival levels, the XO frequencies are lower in the O2 than in the N2 groups of both the Canton-S and ebony series viewed in the context of the mechanisms that have been postulated to explain the loss of ring-X chromosomes in irradiated mature spermatozoa permits the following interpretation for the observed results: (i) a higher proportion of potential XO zygotes is lost through dominant lethality in the O2 groups than in the N2 ones presumably because the chromosome breaks induced in O2 are qualitatively different in the sense that they have a higher probability to undergo reunions relative to restitution, compared with breaks induced under anoxia and (ii) this leads to lower than expected oxygen-enhancement ratios (i.e., expected on the basis of published data on sex-linked recessive lethals, another kind of genetic damage which shows a linear exposure-frequency relationship.",Excluded,0.96131945

The estimation of such risks directly through observational studies would generally require infeasibly large studies and long-term follow-up to achieve reasonable statistical power. We developed an online radiation risk assessment tool (RadRAT) which can be used to estimate the lifetime risk of radiation-related cancer with uncertainty intervals following a user-specified exposure history (https://irep.nci.nih.gov/radrat). The uncertainty intervals constitute a key component of the program because of the various assumptions that are involved in such calculations. The risk models used in RadRAT are broadly based on those developed by the BEIR VII committee for estimating lifetime risk following low-dose radiation exposure of the US population for eleven site-specific cancers. We developed new risk models for seven additional cancer sites, oral, oesophagus, gallbladder, pancreas, rectum, kidney and brain/central nervous system (CNS) cancers, using data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The lifetime risk estimates are slightly higher for RadRAT than for BEIR VII across all exposure ages mostly because the weighting of the excess relative risk and excess absolute risk models was conducted on an arithmetic rather than a logarithmic scale. The calculator can be used to estimate lifetime cancer risk from both uniform and non-uniform doses that are acute or chronic.

In this context, we investigated the impact of the sterilisation process on male mating success and sexual competitiveness in the laboratory and under semi-feld conditions. Males from a young laboratory colony (F4) were irradiated as pupae (>20h old) with gamma-rays at 35 or 40 Gy. In the laboratory, the time for male sexual maturation was not affected by the irradiation, neither was the insemination rate of 4 days old males as compared to un-irradiated ones. The daily individual mating success of sterile males during 15 days was reduced as compared to un-irradiated males; however the differences were signifcant only during the second week. Sterility was maintained over successive matings and after a resting period. Under semi-feld conditions, sterile males competed well against wild males, though a resting period of 5 days in the laboratory before release greatly improved their effciency. A ratio of fve sterile to one wild male resulted in a two-fold reduction of the wild females' mean fertility. Valuable information on the effects of the sterilization process was collected and it is suggested that an effcient reduction of a wild population might be achieved by releasing sterile males as adults. Moreover, the results indicate that a resting period allows a recovery from radiation-induced somatic damages which improved the biological quality of the males.",Excluded,0.9611697
214,"A case-control study of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the high background radiation areas of Yangjiang, China The main purposes of this study were to identify the major determinants of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the high-background radiation areas (HBRA) in Yangjiang, China and to evaluate their potential confounding effects on the NPC risk associated with exposure to high background radiation. A matched case-control study was conducted using those who died of NPC during the period 1987-1995. Two controls were randomly selected for each case from those who died from causes other than malignancies and external causes. Cases and their controls were matched with respect to sex and the years of birth and death (+/- 5 years). Study subjects' next-of-kin were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire to collect information on socioeconomic status, dietary habits, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption, disease history, pesticide use, medical X-ray exposure, the family history of NPC and so on. We succeeded in interviewing 97 cases and 192 controls. Univariate conditional logistic regression analysis showed that NPC risk was associated with the consumption of salted fish, homemade pickles, and fermented soy beans, education levels, the history of chronic rhinitis, and the family history of NPC. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that education levels (Odds ratio (OR) for middle school or higher levels vs. no school education = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.2 to 11.8), salted fish intake (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.7 to 6.1), the history of chronic rhinitis (OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.3 to 10.1), and the family history of NPC (OR = 14.2, 95% CI = 2.7 to 73.4) were independent risk factors of NPC. Tobacco smoking (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.7 to 2.1), and alcohol consumption (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.5 to 1.9) were not significantly related to NPC risk. The ORs of NPC risk comparing HBRA and a nearby control area before and after adjustment for the major risk determinants identified in the present study were 0.86 (95% CI = 0.50 to 1.50) and 0.87 (95% CI = 0.45 to 1.67), respectively. Salted fish intake was a strong risk factor of NPC. Education, the history of chronic rhinitis and the family history of NPC were also related to NPC risk. The exposure to high background radiation in HBRA of Yangjiang was not related to NPC risk with or without the adjustment for those major risk determinants of NPC.",Excluded,0.96114796
243,"Hepatic irradiation augments engraftment of donor cells following hepatocyte transplantation Engraftment of donor hepatocytes is a critical step that determines the success of hepatocyte transplantation. Rapid and efficient integration of donor cells would enable prompt liver repopulation of these cells in response to selective proliferative stimuli offered by a preparative regimen. We have earlier demonstrated that hepatic irradiation (HIR) in combination with a variety of hepatotrophic growth signals, such as partial hepatectomy and hepatocyte growth factor, can be used as a preparative regimen for liver repopulation of transplanted hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated the effects of HIR on engraftment of transplanted dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV)-positive hepatocytes in congeneic DPPIV-deficient rats. HIR-induced apoptosis of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC) within 6 hours of HIR resulted in dehiscence of the SEC lining in 24 hours. Although there was no change of the number of Kupffer cells after HIR, colloidal carbon clearance decreased 24 hours post HIR, indicating a suppression of phagocytic function. DPPIV + donor cells were transplanted 24 hours after HIR (0-50 Gy). There was an HIR dose-dependent increase in the donor hepatocyte mass engrafted in the liver parenchyma. The number of viable transplanted hepatocytes present in hepatic sinusoids or integrated in the parenchyma was greater in the HIR-treated group at 3 and 7 days after transplantation compared with the sham controls. Finally, we validated these rodent studies in cynomolgus monkeys, demonstrating that a single 10-Gy dose of HIR was sufficient to enhance engraftment of donor porcine hepatocytes. These data indicate that transient disruption of the SEC barrier and inhibition of the phagocytic function of Kupffer cells by HIR enhances hepatocyte engraftment and the integrated donor cell mass. Thus, preparative HIR could be potentially useful to augment hepatocyte transplantation. Copyright © 2008 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded,0.9611354

In addition, five males and five females were treated in a similar fashion, but were exposed to sham conditions. For each subject, a blood sample was obtained prior to the exposure period and aliquots were used as negative- (pre-exposure) and positive- [1.5 Gray (Gy) (60)Cobalt ((60)Co) gamma-irradiation] controls. At the end of the 4 h exposure period, a second blood sample was obtained. The extent of DNA damage was assessed in peripheral human blood leukocytes from all samples using the alkaline comet assay. To detect possible clastogenic effects, the incidence of micronuclei was assessed in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay., RESULTS: There was no evidence of either increased DNA damage, as indicated by the alkaline comet assay, or increased incidence of micronuclei (MN) in the magnetic field exposed group. However, an in vitro exposure of 1.5 Gy gamma-irradiation caused a significant increase in both DNA damage and MN induction., CONCLUSIONS: This study found no evidence that an acute, whole-body exposure to a 200 microT, 60 Hz magnetic field for 4 hours could cause DNA damage in human blood.",Excluded,0.9611333
374,"Risk assessment for developing gliomas: A comparison of two cytogenetic approaches Chromosome instability (CIN) measured as chromosome aberrations has long been suggested as a cancer susceptibility biomarker. Conventional cytogenetic end-points are now being improved by combining molecular methods, which increases the sensitivity, specificity, and precision of the assay. In this study we examined both spontaneous and gamma-ray induced CIN in lymphocyte cultures from 51 previously untreated glioma patients and 51 age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched controls. CIN was assessed using two parallel methods: (1) the mutagen sensitivity (MS) assay and (2) the multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. The frequency of spontaneous breaks was significantly higher in glioma patients (mean +/- S.D., 2.12 +/- 1.07) than in controls (1.24 +/- 0.86, P < 0.001) when using the FISH assay but not the MS assay (0.019 +/- 0.02 and 0.019 +/- 0.01, respectively; P = 0.915). Similarly, the frequency of induced chromatid breaks was significantly higher using the FISH assay (3.39 +/- 1.72) but not the MS assay (0.42 +/- 0.16) in the patients versus controls (2.08 +/- 1.18 and 0.37 +/- 0.15, respectively; P < 0.001 and P = 0.10, respectively). By using the median number of breaks in the controls as the cutoff value, we observed an odds ratio (ORs) of 5.13 (95% CI = 2.23-12.1) for spontaneous and 4.86 (95% CI = 2.08-11.4) for induced CIN using the FISH assay, whereas the ORs were 1.32 (95% CI = 0.49-3.58) and 1.28 (95% CI = 0.59-2.80) for spontaneous and induced CIN using the MS assay. There was also a significant increase in the frequency of hyperdiploid cells in the glioma cases which could only be detected using the FISH assay (OR = 4.0, 95% CL = 0.9-17.0). By combining both methods an estimated risk of 7.0 (95% CI = 1.7-25.6) was observed. There was no correlation between the breaks detected by the two methods suggesting that each method is a measure of a different event. The results indicate that using the multicolor FISH assay for detection of CIN in peripheral blood lymphocytes in glioma patients is a more useful marker for risk assessment. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded,0.96111786
994,"Cytogenetic and molecular characterization of plutonium-induced rat osteosarcomas The association between ionizing radiation and the subsequent development of osteosarcoma has been well described, but little is known about the cytogenetic and molecular events, which could be involved in the formation of radiation-induced osteosarcomas. Here, we performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to detect chromosomal copy number changes in a series of 16 rat osteosarcomas induced by injection of plutonium-238. Recurrent gains/amplifications were observed at chromosomal regions 3p12-q12, 3q41-qter, 4q41-qter, 6q12-q16, 7q22-q34, 8q11-q23, 9q11-q22, 10q32.1-qter, and 12q, whereas recurrent losses were observed at 1p, 1q, 3q23-q35, 5q21-q33, 8q24-q31, 10q22-q25, 15p, 15q, and 18q. The gained region at 7q22-q34 was homologous to human chromosome bands 12q13-q15/8q24/22q11-q13, including the loci of Mdm2, Cdk4, c-Myc and Pdgf-b genes. The lost regions at 5q21-q33, 10q22-q25 and 15q contained tumor suppressor genes such as p16INK4a/p19ARF, Tp53 and Rb1. To identify potential target gene(s) for the chromosomal aberrations, we compared the expression levels of several candidate genes, located within the regions of frequent chromosomal aberrations, between the tumors and normal osteoblasts by using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The Cdk4, c-Myc, Pdgf-b and p57KIP2 genes were thought to be possible target genes for the frequent chromosomal gain at 7q22-34 and loss at 1q in the tumors, respectively. In addition, mutations of the Tp53 gene were found in 27% (4 of 15) osteosarcomas. Our data may contribute to further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying osteosarcomas induced by ionizing radiation in human.",Excluded,0.9610542
351,"Radiation dose response estimation with emphasis on low dose range using restricted cubic splines: application to all solid cancer mortality data, 1950-2003, in atomic bomb survivors Using the all solid cancer mortality data set of the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort from 1950 to 2003 (LSS Report 14) data among atomic bomb survivors, excess relative risk (ERR) statistical analyses were performed using the second degree polynomial and the threshold and restricted cubic spline (RCS) dose response models. For the RCS models with 3 to 7 knots of equally spaced percentiles with margins in the dose range greater than 50 mGy, the dose response was assumed to be linear at less than 70 to 90 mGy. Due to the skewed dose distribution of atomic bomb survivors, the current knot system for the RCS analysis results in a detailed depiction of the dose response as less than approximately 0.5 Gy. The 6 knot RCS models for the all-solid cancer mortality dose response of the whole dose or less than 2 Gy were selected with the AIC model selection criterion and fit significantly better (p < 0.05) than the linear (L) model. The usual RCS includes the L-global model but not the quadratic (Q) nor linear-quadratic (LQ) global models. The authors extended the RCS to include L or LQ global models by putting L or LQ constraints on the cubic spline in the lower and upper tails, and the best RCS model selected with AIC criterion was the usual RCS with L-constraints in both the lower and upper tails. The selected RCS had a linear dose-response model in the lower dose range (i.e., < 0.2-0.3 Gy) and was compatible with the linear no-threshold (LNT) model in this dose range. The proposed method is also useful in describing the dose response of a specific cancer or non-cancer disease incidence/mortality.",Excluded,0.9609907

The patients received radiation therapy for head and neck cancer at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. For each patient the 3D dose distribution delivered to the upper 5 cm of the oesophagus was analysed. The analysis was conducted for two periods, 1992-2000 and 2001-2005, due to the different irradiation techniques used. The fitting has been done using the relative seriality model., RESULTS: For the treatment period 1992-2005, the mean doses were 49.8 and 33.4 Gy, respectively, for the cases and the controls. For the period 1992-2000, the mean doses for the cases and the controls were 49.9 and 45.9 Gy and for the period 2001-2005 were 49.8 and 21.4 Gy. For the period 2001-2005 the best estimates of the dose-response parameters are D(50)=61.5 Gy (52.9-84.9 Gy), gamma=1.4 (0.8-2.6) and s=0.1 (0.01-0.3)., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced strictures were found to have a dose response relation and volume dependence (low relative seriality) for the treatment period 2001-2005.

846,"31P NMR spectroscopy can predict the optimum interval between fractionated irradiation doses This study was performed to clarify whether changes in the metabolites observed by phosphorous-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) could indicate an optimum interval between two doses of radiation in a murine tumor model. Murine mammary carcinoma cells, FM3A, were irradiated 7 days after transplantation with a single 5 Gy dose without anesthesia. 31P spectra were measured with a spectrometer up to 30 days. The beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi values were calculated from the peak area of each spectrum. In a fractionation experiment, two fractions of irradiation at a 5 Gy per fraction were given at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 6 day intervals. Tumor growth delay was also scored to determine the fractionated radiation effect. In the control group, beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi decreased with tumor growth. In the single irradiation group, the tumor did not grow up to day 6, and an initial rise and subsequent decrease in beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed. Maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed on day 2 after irradiation. In a fractionation experiment, the greatest growth delay was observed in the two day interval group, in which maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were demonstrated in 31P-MRS. Our results suggested that changes in the metabolites observed by 31P-MRS could be useful indicators for determining the fractionation schedule in radiation therapy.",Excluded,0.96090704

Twenty-six BDIX rats were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb syngeneic colon cancer cells in the right hind flank. Three weeks post-inoculation, the right leg of 12 rats bearing the tumor nodule was treated with BPA-BNCT (BPA-Boronophenylalanine) at the RA-3 nuclear reactor located in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at an absorbed dose of 7.5 Gy to skin as the dose-limiting tissue. The remaining group of 14 tumor-bearing rats were left untreated and used as control. Two weeks post-BNCT, 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb cells were injected subcutaneously in the contralateral left hind flank of each of the 26 BDIX rats. Tumor volume in both legs was measured weekly for 7 weeks to determine response to BNCT in the right leg and to assess a potential influence of BNCT in the right leg on tumor development in the left leg. Within the BNCT group, a statistically significant reduction was observed in contralateral left tumor volume in animals whose right leg tumor responded to BNCT (post-treatment/pre-treatment tumor volume <1) versus animals who failed to respond (post/pre >=1), i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 271 +/- 128 mm3. In addition, a statistically significant reduction in contralateral left leg tumor volume was observed in BNCT-responsive animals (post/pre <1) vs untreated animals, i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 254 +/- 251 mm3.

Incidence ratios were standardized to the general population and computed for different cancer sites., RESULTS: The cumulative risk for cancer at all sites (excluding brain tumors where the standardized incidence ratio [SIR] was 28) reached 86% 50 years after Thorotrast injection. SIR was greatly elevated at all sites except the brain and CNS (3.3, 95% confidence interval = 3.0-3.7), mainly because of liver cancers (SIR = 126) as well as leukemia (SIR = 10) for which a relationship was found between the time since injection and the estimated dose (but not the age at injection). Other sites with significantly increased risks of cancer included the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts (SIR = 14), peritoneum (SIR = 8.6), sites of multiple myeloma (SIR = 4.6), metastatic sites (SIR = 12), and unspecified sites (SIR = 11). Cancers of the lung and breast also occurred in significant excess, but no relationship between SIR and volume of injected Thorotrast or time since injection was observed. Cancer risk was increased at most other sites, although this increase was not statistically significant., CONCLUSION: Alpha radiation may account for the increased risk of tumors of the liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum as well as leukemia and multiple myeloma, whereas confounding factors most probably contribute to the increased risks at other sites.",Excluded,0.9608236

965,"Long-term in vitro and in vivo effects of gamma-irradiated BCG on innate and adaptive immunity BCG vaccination is associated with a reduced mortality from nonmycobacterial infections. This is likely to be mediated by a combination of innate-immune memory (trained immunity"") and heterologous effects on adaptive immunity. As such, BCG could be used to boost host immunity but not in immunocompromised hosts, as it is a live, attenuated vaccine. Therefore, we assessed whether killed gammaBCG has similar potentiating effects. In an in vitro model of trained immunity, human monocytes were incubated with gammaBCG for 24 h and restimulated after 6 d. Cytokine production and the role of pattern recognition receptors and histone methylation markers were assessed. The in vivo effects of gammaBCG vaccination were studied in a proof-of-principle trial in 15 healthy volunteers. gammaBCG induced trained immunity in vitro via the NOD2 receptor pathway and up-regulation of H3K4me3 histone methylation. However, these effects were less strong than those induced by live BCG. gammaBCG vaccination in volunteers had only minimal effects on innate immunity, whereas a significant increase in heterologous Th1/Th17 immunity was observed. Our results indicate that gammaBCG induces long-term training of innate immunity in vitro. In vivo, gammaBCG induces mainly heterologous effects on the adaptive-immune system, whereas effects on innate cytokine production are limited.

When cells treated with IUDR were compared with irradiated cells for the isolation of C. trachomatis from clinical specimens, 5 of 138 specimens yielded isolates in IUDR-treated cells not found in irradiated ones, and one isolate was obtained from irradiated but not from IUDR-treated cells. In those 56 cases where inclusions were seen in both systems, there were significantly more inclusions in IUDR-treated than in irradiated cells.

1137,"A review of the effects of uranium and depleted uranium exposure on reproduction and fetal development Depleted uranium (DU) is used in armor-penetrating munitions, military vehicle armor, and aircraft, ship and missile counterweighting/ballasting, as well as in a number of other military and commercial applications. Recent combat applications of DU alloy [i.e., Persian Gulf War (PGW) and Kosovo peacekeeping objective] resulted in human acute exposure to DU dust, vapor or aerosol, as well as chronic exposure from tissue embedding of DU shrapnel fragments. DU alloy is 99.8% 238Uranium, and emits approximately 60% of the alpha, beta, and gamma radiation found in natural uranium (4.05 x 10(-7) Ci/g DU alloy). DU is a heavy metal that is 160% more dense than lead and can remain within the body for many years and slowly solubilize. High levels of urinary uranium have been measured in PGW veterans 10 years after exposure to DU fragments and vapors. In rats, there is strong evidence of DU accumulation in tissues including testes, bone, kidneys, and brain. In vitro tests indicate that DU alloy may be both genotoxic and mutagenic, whereas a recent in vivo study suggests that tissue-embedded DU alloy may be carcinogenic in rats. There is limited available data for reproductive and teratological deficits from exposure to uranium per se, typically from oral, respiratory, or dermal exposure routes. Alternatively, there is no data available on the reproductive effects of DU embedded. This paper reviews published studies of reproductive toxicity in humans and animals from uranium or DU exposure, and discusses ongoing animal research to evaluate reproductive effects in male and female rats embedded with DU fragments, and possible consequences in F1 and F2 generations.",Excluded,0.9604191
953,"The impact of lymphocyte isolation on induced DNA damage in human blood samples measured by the comet assay The comet assay is frequently used in human biomonitoring for the detection of exposure to genotoxic agents. Peripheral blood samples are most frequently used and tested either as whole blood or after isolation of lymphocytes (i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMC). To investigate a potential impact of lymphocyte isolation on induced DNA damage in human blood samples, we exposed blood ex vivo to mutagens with different modes of genotoxic action. The comet assay was performed either directly with whole blood at the end of the exposure period or with lymphocytes isolated directly after exposure. In addition to the recommended standard protocol for lymphocyte isolation, a shortened protocol was established to optimise the isolation procedure. The results indicate that the effects of induced DNA strand breaks and alkali-labile sites induced by ionising radiation and alkylants, respectively, are significantly reduced in isolated lymphocytes. In contrast, oxidative DNA base damage (induced by potassium bromate) and stable bulky adducts (induced by benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide; BPDE) seem to be less affected. Our findings suggest that in vivo-induced DNA damage might also be reduced in isolated lymphocytes in comparison with the whole blood depending of the types of DNA damage induced. Because only small genotoxic effects can generally be expected in human biomonitoring studies with the comet assay after occupational and environmental exposure to genotoxic agents, any loss might be relevant and should be avoided. The possibility of such effects and their potential impact on variability of comet assay results in human biomonitoring should be considered when performing or evaluating such kind of studies.

301,"Somatic-cell mutations as a possible predictor of cancer risk The somatic-mutation theory of carcinogenesis has received strong scientific support from results of recent studies on tumor-suppressor genes. We anticipated that people among the high risk for cancer group, either through exposure to various ionizing radiations or by virtue of unique genotypes, would also manifest increased frequencies of somatic mutation. This report presents the results of two somatic-mutation assays--at the erythrocyte glycophorin A (GPA) and lymphocyte T-cell receptor (TCR) genes--in various groups at high risk for cancer development, including atomic-bomb survivors, patients with various cancers, patients administered Thorotrast, and patients with genetic disorders that make them cancer prone. Although neither the GPA-mutation nor the TCR-mutation assay detects gene mutations directly related to carcinogenesis, increased mutation frequencies were detected by both assays in many individuals among the high-risk groups and among cancer patients.

Thus, these assays may prove useful for identifying high-risk cancer groups and for estimating the effects of mutagens.

426,"Nasal mucociliary clearance after radiation therapy Irradiation has been demonstrated to cause decreased mucociliary clearance in animal models. We sought to verify this effect clinically by using the saccharin transport test to evaluate nasal mucociliary clearance in 9 patients previously treated with radiation therapy to the nasal cavity. The patients also completed a questionnaire examining the prevalence of nasal symptoms before and after radiation therapy. Patients who received radiation therapy had no clearance of saccharin from the nasal cavity at a minimum of 20 minutes. The controls had a median clearance time of 5 minutes. The patients noted a higher prevalence of nasal congestion, drainage, and facial pain after radiation therapy. This study demonstrates that radiation therapy to the nasal cavity causes a decrease in nasal mucociliary clearance. This alteration should be considered when selecting therapy for malignancies in the nasal area.",Excluded,0.9600972
249,"Inter-laboratory consistency and variability in the buccal micronucleus cytome assay depends on biomarker scored and laboratory experience: results from the HUMNxl international inter-laboratory scoring exercise The buccal micronucleus cytome (BMNcyt) assay in uncultured exfoliated epithelial cells from oral mucosa is widely applied in biomonitoring human exposures to genotoxic agents and is also proposed as a suitable test for prescreening and follow-up of precancerous oral lesions. The main limitation of the assay is the large variability observed in the baseline values of micronuclei (MNi) and other nuclear anomalies mainly related to different scoring criteria. The aim of this international collaborative study, involving laboratories with different level of experience, was to evaluate the inter- and intra-laboratory variations in the BMNcyt parameters, using recently implemented guidelines, in scoring cells from the same pooled samples obtained from healthy subjects (control group) and from cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (treated group). The results indicate that all laboratories correctly discriminated samples from the two groups by a significant increase of micronucleus (MN) and nuclear bud (NBUD) frequencies and differentiated binucleated (BN) cells, associated with the exposure to ionizing radiation. The experience of the laboratories was shown to play an important role in the identification of the different cell types and nuclear anomalies. MN frequency in differentiated mononucleated (MONO) and BN cells showed the greatest consistency among the laboratories and low variability was also detected in the frequencies of MONO and BN cells. A larger variability was observed in classifying the different cell types, indicating the subjectivity in the interpretation of some of the scoring criteria while reproducibility of the results between scoring sessions was very good. An inter-laboratory calibration exercise is strongly recommended before starting studies with BMNcyt assay involving multiple research centers. Copyright © The Author 2016.

487,"Radioprotection of hematopoietic stem cells by interleukin-1 Radioprotective agents such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), when given prior to irradiation, protect animals from radiation damage. However, in vivo administration of these cytokines does not allow one to determine whether the protective effects act directly on the hematopoietic system. In the present study, we subjected male bone marrow cells to in vitro treatment with IL-1 prior to irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. We found that male bone marrow cells pretreated with IL-1 prior to irradiation increased the survival of irradiated female recipient mice when compared with nontreated irradiated marrow cells. In addition, irradiated female recipients that received IL-1-pretreated male donor bone marrow cells displayed an increased presence of male donor cells in their bone marrow, spleen, and thymus for up to 3 months posttransplant. Furthermore, serial transplantation studies revealed that male cells could only be detected in tertiary female recipients who received bone marrow from mice transplanted with IL-1-treated cells. These results indicate that IL-1 pretreatment protects both short-term and long-term repopulating stem cells from an irradiation insult and that these cells are capable of reconstituting the myeloid and lymphoid organs of recipient mice.",Excluded,0.96001357
107,"Lymphocyte transformation to phytohaemagglutinin and delayed hypersensitivity related to age and previous cancer history Declining immunosurveillance in old age has been considered one possible explanation for the increased incidence of cancer in the elderly. This study was set up to search for evidence of persistent immunodeficiency in patients with a past history of cancer. Lymphocyte responses to phytohaemagglutinin and cutaneous delayed hypersensivity were assessed in fifty-seven elderly subjects who had successfully completed treatment for cancer more than 18 months previously and compared with those of forty-three healthy controls matched for age and sex. Although a significant difference between mean tritiated thymidine uptake was observed in the lymphocyte response to phytohaemagglutinin (cancer patients 1859 cpm, control 2502 cpm), this could be explained by an unexpectedly prolonged effect of radiotherapy. Mean counts for those twenty-six cancer patients receiving radiotherapy within the period 18 months to 4 years were low (1257 cpm), but were normal (2366 cpm) for the remainder. A significant negative correlation of lymphocyte transformation with age was confirmed in both groups. There was no significant difference in cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity response to commonly encountered antigens. Whilst recognising that these tests do not comprehensively assess immune function, the present results provide no support for the theory that an age-related decline in immune function contributes to the heightened incidence of cancer in the elderly.",Excluded,0.9599926

483,"Occupational risk factors and reproductive health of women BACKGROUND: This in-depth review summarizes and interprets the available recent epidemiologic evidence on the relationship between occupational exposures and negative reproductive outcome among women workers. METHODS: The studies examined by the review include those published in the international scientific literature since 1990, and were identified through the search of relevant data banks using selected keywords. RESULTS: From the examination of studies dealing with exposures of women to chemical agents, pesticides, physical agents, ergonomic factors and stress, it appears that at present the evidence is sufficient to warrant the maximum protection of pregnant women to several well-documented occupational risk factors. These include exposures to anaesthetic gases, antineoplastic drugs, heavy metals, solvents, heavy physical work and irregular work schedules. For other work risks, such as exposure to non-ionizing radiation and psychosocial work stress, the evidence is often suggestive but not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers and health professionals should advise women and employers to avoid exposure to the well-known occupational risk factors, while epidemiologic research should pursue methodological improvements and provide more insight into the magnitude of exposures responsible for detrimental effects.

55,"Environmental and occupational causes of cancer: new evidence 2005-2007 What do we currently know about the occupational and environmental causes of cancer? As of 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified 415 known or suspected carcinogens. Cancer arises through an extremely complicated web of multiple causes, and we will likely never know the full range of agents or combinations of agents. We do know that preventing exposure to individual carcinogens prevents the disease. Declines in cancer rates-such as the drop in male lung cancer cases from the reduction in tobacco smoking or the drop in bladder cancer among cohorts of dye workers from the elimination of exposure to specific aromatic amines-provides evidence that preventing cancer is possible when we act on what we know. Although the overall age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in the United States among both men and women have declined in the last decade, the rates of several types of cancers are on the rise; some of which are linked to environmental and occupational exposures. This report chronicles the most recent epidemiologic evidence linking occupational and environmental exposures with cancer. Peer-reviewed scientific studies published from January 2005 to June 2007 were reviewed, supplementing our state-of-the-evidence report published in September 2005. Despite weaknesses in certain individual studies, we consider the evidence linking the increased risk of several types of cancer with specific exposures somewhat strengthened by recent publications, among them brain cancer from exposure to non-ionizing radiation, particularly radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile telephones; breast cancer from exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) before puberty; leukemia from exposure to 1,3-butadiene; lung cancer from exposure to air pollution; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) from exposure to pesticides and solvents; and prostate cancer from exposure to pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metal working fluids or mineral oils. In addition to NHL and prostate cancer, early findings from the National Institutes of Health Agricultural Health Study suggest that several additional cancers may be linked to a variety of pesticides. Our report also briefly describes the toxicological evidence related to the carcinogenic effect of specific chemicals and mechanisms that are difficult to study in humans, namely exposures to bis-phenol A and epigenetic, trans-generational effects. To underscore the multi-factorial, multi-stage nature of cancer, we also present a technical description of cancer causation summarizing current knowledge in molecular biology. We argue for a new cancer prevention paradigm, one based on an understanding that cancer is ultimately caused by multiple interacting factors rather than a paradigm based on dubious attributable fractions. This new cancer prevention paradigm demands that we limit exposure to avoidable environmental and occupational carcinogens, in combination with additional important risk factors like diet and lifestyle. The research literature related to environmental and occupational causes of cancer is constantly growing, and future updates will be carried out in light of new biological understanding of the mechanisms and new methods for studying exposures in human populations. The current state of knowledge is sufficient to compel us to act on what we know. We repeat the call of ecologist Sandra Steingraber: From the right to know and the duty to inquire flows the obligation to act.""""",Excluded,0.95932114

1088,"In vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts can identify a group of radiotherapy patients having developed complications in a variety of normal tissues Purpose. - A retrospective study of the in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts derived from two groups of patients treated by definitive radiotherapy for a variety of tumors who either displayed or did not display severe complications. Patients and methods. - Seven radiotherapy patients were selected: three were treated for head and neck, prostate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma tumors, and did not develop any significant complications (control group); four patients were treated for bladder, thyroid, head and neck and anal canal tumors and developed serious acute and especially late reactions (hypersensitive group). Primary cell cultures of skin fibroblasts were established and their radiosensitivity studied by the clonogenic assay after exposing to single radiation doses ranging between 1 and 8 Gy. Results. - The survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) ranged from 0.27 to 0.38, with a mean of 0.33 for the control group, and from 0.10 to 0.20 with a mean of 0.17 for the hypersensitive group. The Mann-Whitney non-parametric test showed that the difference between the two means was statistically significant (p = 0.03). Conclusion. - The data are in favor of a correlation between the radiosensitivity of patients' fibroblasts and the reactions of different normal tissues to radiotherapy. This association supports the use of the clonogenic survival, or a surrogate test, as a predictive assay. The multiplicity of normal tissues and organs implicated in this association suggests the existence of genetic factors that determine, at least in part, the radiosensitivity of target cells involved in the expression of normal tissues complications following radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.9592415
742,"Mating competitiveness of sterile male anopheles coluzzii in semi-field cages The renewed interest in the development of control strategies using sterile insects raises hopes of being able to control the disease by cutting down the high reproductive rate of mosquitoes. Specifically, investigations into factors that account for male mating competitiveness are critical to the development of genetic control strategies. In this study, we assessed the effects of partial irradiation with 75 Gy on Anopheles coluzzii sexual competitiveness when allowed to mate in different ratios of sterile/ fertile males for 2 nights in field cages. Moreover, to determine the dynamics of this competition, competitiveness was compared between males allowed 1 night vs 2 nights of contact with females. Sterilized (S) and fertile (U) males between 4 and 6 days of age were released in field cages (1.70mx1.70mx1.70m) with females (F) of similar age and left for 2 nights at the following ratios (S:U:F): (100:0:100) (100:100:100) (300:100:100) (500:100:100) (0:100:100). Each treatment was replicated 3 times. Competitiveness was determined by assessing the hatching rate of eggs laid en masse and the insemination rate, determined by dissecting recaptured females. An additional experiment with a ratio of (500:100:100) has been done with a mating period of either 1 or 2 nights. For the first experiment, the egg hatching rate was significantly affected by the release ratio and we thus observed that the Fried competitiveness index of sterile males was between 0.29 and 0.55. A similar insemination rate was recorded after 2 nights of contact in experiment 1, while significant difference was observed in the (S:U:F) (100:0:100) ratio between the males left to mate for 1 and 2 nights. However, a similar hatching rate was observed when mating occurred for 1 or 2 nights. The results suggest a release ratio of at least 2 sterile males for 1 fertile male and that An. coluzzii mating competitiveness experiments in field cages should be run for 1 instead of 2 nights.",Excluded,0.9590196

Both mast cell progenitors (MCp) and mature mast cells express these cell surface markers, and ways validated to distinguish between the two maturation forms with flow cytometry have been lacking. Here, we show that primary peritoneal MCp from naive mice expressed high levels of integrin beta7 and had a low side scatter (SSC) light profile; whereas mature mast cells expressed lower levels of integrin beta7 and had a high SSC light profile. The maturation statuses of the cells were confirmed using three main strategies: (1) MCp, but not mature mast cells, were shown to be depleted by sublethal whole-body gamma-irradiation. (2) The MCp were small and immature in terms of granule formation, whereas the mature mast cells were larger and had fully developed metachromatic granules. (3) The MCp had fewer transcripts of mast cell-specific proteases and the enzyme responsible for sulfation of heparin than mature mast cells. Moreover, isolated peritoneal MCp gave rise to mast cells when cultured in vitro. To summarize, we have defined MCp and mature mast cells in naive mice by flow cytometry. Using this strategy, mast cell maturation can be studied in vivo.",Excluded,0.9585585

We identified patients (n = 130) with neurologist-confirmed idiopathic PD through contacts with Calgary general hospitals, long-term care facilities, neurologists, the Movement Disorder Clinic, and the Parkinson's Society of Southern Alberta, and selected two matched (by sex and age +/- 2.5 years) community controls for each case by random digit dialing. We obtained lifetime work, chemical, radiation, medical, and smoking exposure histories and family histories of PD and essential tremor by personal interviews, and analyzed the data using conditional logistic regression for matched sets. After controlling for potential confounding and interaction between the exposure variables, using multivariate statistical methods, having a family history of PD was the strongest predictor of PD risk, followed by head trauma and then occupational herbicide use. Cases and controls did not differ in their previous exposures to smoking or ionizing radiation; family history of essential tremor; work-related contact with aluminum, carbon monoxide, cyanide, manganese, mercury, or mineral oils; or history of arteriosclerosis, chicken pox, encephalitis, hypertension, hypotension, measles, mumps, rubella, or Spanish flu.

In this report, the effect of implanted DU on adult rat behavior and health is described. Adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, 8 wk of age, were surgically implanted with 0, 4, 8, 12, or 20 DU pellets (1 x 2 mm); 20 DU pellets of size 1 x 2 mm approximates to 0.22 kg (0.5 lb) of DU in a 70-kg (154 lb) person. Control animals were implanted with 12 or 20 tantallum (Ta) pellets. The animals were then housed for up to 150 d postimplantation or 20% of an assumed 2-yr life span for rats. The concentration of uranium in urine directly correlated with the number of implanted DU pellets, indicating that DU was migrating into the body from the implanted pellets. Three male and 4 female animals died during the 150-d period of causes apparently not related to DU implantation. Behavioral testing found no definitive evidence of neurobehavioral perturbations associated with DU implantation. Uranium translocated to tissues known to sequester uranium (bone, teeth, and kidneys), but uranium concentrations varied considerably within each dose group and did not follow a dose-response pattern as anticipated. Serum chemistry values were within normal ranges for the SD rat. However, alanine aminotransferase measurements were significantly lower for rats implanted with 20 DU pellets as compared to sham surgery controls but not when compared to animals implanted with Ta pellets only. Phosphate measurements were significantly lower for female rats implanted with 20 DU pellets as compared to both sham surgery controls and animals implanted with Ta pellets only. Monocyte ratios were higher in adult rats implanted with 20 DU pellets as compared to sham surgery controls but not when compared to animals implanted with 20 Ta pellets. Mean platelet volume was found to be significantly lower for rats implanted with 20 DU pellets as compared to sham surgery controls but not when compared to animals implanted with 20 Ta pellets. Gross necropsy found no obvious tissue abnormalities in implanted rats, and the weights of major tissues did not differ between Ta- and DU-implanted animals. Histopathologic analysis of major tissues from animals implanted with 0 pellets, 20 Ta pellets, or 20 DU pellets found no differences between treatment groups. The findings of this study indicate that implantation of up to 20 DU pellets in adult rats did not have a significant negative impact on their general health and neurobehavioral capacities when assessed after 150 d of pellet implantation. However, the growing body of data on the potential health effects associated with DU exposure warrants further studies involving higher embedded DU body burdens in conjunction with longer surveillance periods postimplantation.",Excluded,0.958463
926,"Histopathology of arteriovenous malformations after gamma knife radiosurgery Stereotactic radiosurgery effectively obliterates many arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Hemodynamic changes in AVMs after radiosurgery have been illustrated using magnetic resonance imaging and angiography, but there have been no detailed reports describing the underlying histopathological changes. This study examines AVMs at various times after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and describes the histopathological changes that lead to vessel occlusion. The authors examined nine AVM specimens obtained 10 months to more than 5 years after GKRS, by using routine histopathological stains as well as immunohistochemical techniques to detect smooth-muscle actin, factor VIII, and type IV collagen. Blood vessels within the AVMs showed progressive changes leading to narrowing or obliteration of the lumen. The earliest changes after gamma knife irradiation appear to be damage to endothelial cells, followed by progressive thickening of the intimal layer caused by proliferation of smooth-muscle cells that elaborate an extracellular matrix that includes type IV collagen. Finally, cellular degeneration and hyaline transformation occur. For statistical correlation analyses, the specimens were graded according to the degree of histopathological change and the relative number of vessels showing such changes. Both of these parameters were significantly correlated with time after GKRS and with AVM size reduction shown on follow-up imaging studies. Gamma knife radiosurgery of AVMs causes endothelial damage, which induces the proliferation of smooth-muscle cells and the elaboration of extracellular collagen by these cells, which leads to progressive stenosis and obliteration of the AVM nidus. This series of pathological changes in AVMs after GKRS is essentially similar to the response-to-injury model of atherosclerosis.",Excluded,0.95807844

Unlike schistosome vaccine development strategies that relied on direct selection of antigens from crude responses leading to selection of mildly protective antigens, the present study tested the utility of selection of potentially protective antigens encompassed rounds of immunoregulation via idiotypic network. Anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) were purified from sera of New Zealand white rabbits multiply immunized with gamma-irradiated cercariae of S. haematobium, using adult worm specific idiotypes (Ab1) purified from sera of subjects resistant to reinfection. Ab2 was used for immunization of C57BL/6 mice and consequences of immunization were monitored before and after challenge infection with S. haematobium. Results showed an increase of splenic T cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) upon immunization (average % stimulated cells 54.9 vs. 20.4, P < 0.05 for ICAM-1 and 31.1 vs. 6.6, P < 0.01 for VLA-4) and challenge, especially at day 6 (83.5 vs. 45.6, P < 0.01) for ICAM-1 and day 10 (50.4 vs. 20.8, P < 0.05) for VLA-4. Thereafter, both adhesion molecules declined at day 28 through 90. Similarly, lymphoproliferation was manifested upon immunization (OD570-630 0.27 vs. 0.09, P < 0.01) and challenge at day 6 (0.5 vs. 0.17, P < 0.01) through day 10 (0.49 vs.0.18, P < 0.05), then declined at day 28 through 90. Moreover, sera of Ab2-immunized mice exhibited an anti-anti-ids (Ab3) reactivity against antigens of approximate molecular weight 40, 80 and 160 kDa of adult worms, which were also recognized by Ab1. However, in contrast to Ab1, Ab3 showed no surface binding to 3 hr schistosomula. Strikingly, mice immunized with Ab2 showed strong resistance to challenge infection (approximately 82% reduction in worm burden, P < 0.001). Taking all, this alternative vaccine development strategy appears to filter out non-protective antigens. Indeed Ab3 recognizes much fewer numbers of antigens, which passed through two rounds of immune regulation. These antigens appear to represent a significant proportion of the protective response in the gamma-irradiated cercariae vaccine and human resistance model as well, providing the basis for an alternative vaccine for schistosomiasis.",Excluded,0.9575623

Several cancer-preventive mechanisms have been proposed, such as antioxidant properties and modulation of biotransformation enzyme activities; both may be associated with reducing DNA damage and hence the mutation rate. We investigated, in a randomized, controlled, crossover feeding trial, the effect of 10 servings/day of botanically defined F&V for 2 wk on endogenous DNA damage; resistance to gamma-irradiation damage; and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes, measured by the Comet assay. We also explored the association between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and serum bilirubin concentrations and DNA damage and repair measures. Healthy men (n = 11) and women (n = 17), age 20 to 40 yr, provided blood samples at the end of each feeding period. Overall, F&V did not affect DNA damage and repair measures in lymphocytes. The number of UGT1A1*28 alleles was inversely associated with sensitivity to gamma-irradiation exposure and DNA repair capacity, but a biological mechanism to explain this association is unclear. A larger sample size is needed to investigate the association between bilirubin concentrations and endogenous DNA damage. With inconsistent findings in the literature, additional dietary intervention studies on the effect of F&V on DNA damage and repair are needed.

The aim of this study was to obtain a diabetic chimeric model with bone marrow cells expressing enhanced green fluorecence protein (EGFP), without modifying the course of diabetic nephropathy. Material(s) and Method(s): Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed in an obese type 2 diabetic murine model (db/db) owing to a mutation in the leptin receptor gene. Whole bone marrow from female donor C57BL/6 EGFP+ mice was transplanted into 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice and into 8- and 24-week-old female C57BLKS (db/db) EGFP- mice. Recipient mice received total body irradiation (TBI) followed by bone marrow (BM) cell infusion. We tested various irradiation doses (Gy) and numbers of BM cells. Result(s): When a low TBI dose and a small number of BM cells were administered, only syngeneic C57BL/6 mice became chimeric, whereas allogeneic db/db mice showed rejection. When Gy dose and BM cells were increased, db/db mice became chimeric. However, 8-week-old db/db mice lost the obese phenotype and became normoglycemic, probably due to peripheral BM cell infiltration. Conversely, 24-week-old db/db mice remained obese showing similar blood glucose values, body weights, albuminuria, and glomerular lesions at nontransplanted db/db mice. Conclusion(s): Recipient age greatly influenced the peripheral repopulation after BMT in db/db mice. Only the adult chimeric db/db mice seemed to be a good model to study the cellular mechanisms involved in the regression of diabetic nephropathy. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

239,"Kidney cancer mortality in Spain: geographic patterns and possible hypotheses BACKGROUND: Since the second half of the 1990s, kidney cancer mortality has tended to stabilize and decline in many European countries, due to the decrease in the prevalence of smokers. Nevertheless, incidence of kidney cancer is rising across the sexes in some of these countries, a trend which may possibly reflect the fact that improvements in diagnostic techniques are being outweighed by the increased prevalence of some of this tumor's risk factors. This study sought to: examine the geographic pattern of kidney cancer mortality in Spain; suggest possible hypotheses that would help explain these patterns; and enhance existing knowledge about the large proportion of kidney tumors whose cause remains unknown., METHODS: Smoothed municipal relative risks (RRs) for kidney cancer mortality were calculated in men and women, using the conditional autoregressive model proposed by Besag, York and Mollie. Maps were plotted depicting smoothed relative risk estimates, and the distribution of the posterior probability of RR>1 by sex., RESULTS: Municipal maps displayed a marked geographic pattern, with excess mortality in both sexes, mainly in towns along the Bay of Biscay, including areas of Asturias, the Basque Country and, to a lesser extent, Cantabria. Among women, the geographic pattern was strikingly singular, not in evidence for any other tumors, and marked by excess risk in towns situated in the Salamanca area and Extremaduran Autonomous Region. This difference would lead one to postulate the existence of different exposures of environmental origin in the various regions., CONCLUSION: The reasons for this pattern of distribution are not clear, and it would thus be of interest if the effect of industrial emissions on this disease could be studied. The excess mortality observed among women in towns situated in areas with a high degree of natural radiation could reflect the influence of exposures which derive from the geologic composition of the terrain and then become manifest through the agency of drinking water.",Excluded,0.9558591

As a cumulative effective dose (CED) >= 100 mSv is considered significant for stochastic risks of cancer, it is important to monitor and control the radiation exposure of the IBD patients. In the present work, we aimed to quantify the mean CED in IBD patients to assess any harmful effects of radiation., Methods: This study includes 200 IBD patients, identified retrospectively, from the outpatient clinics of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal between January 1, 2010, and February 15, 2017, from the gastroenterologists' patients lists. The number and type of each radiology test performed were listed for each patient during the study period and the CED was calculated using our institution's dose index when available and standardized tables., Results: Among the 200 IBD patients, 157 patients had Crohn's disease (CD), 41 had ulcerative colitis (UC), and 2 had indeterminate colitis. The mean CED for IBD patients was 23.1 +/- 45.2 mSv during a mean follow-up duration of 4.3 years. CED was higher among patients with CD than with UC (27.5 +/- 49.5 versus 6.8 +/- 14.8 mSv; p<0.01). Six patients were exposed to a high CED (>100 mSv) and all had CD., Conclusion: While potentially harmful levels of radiation exposure are of concern in only a small number of patients, strategies to limit such exposure are encouraged when clinically appropriate.",Excluded,0.9553102
1011,"Osteoradionecrosis of the mandible after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer: risk factors and dose-volume correlations Background: The project aimed at determining the incidence of mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) after radiotherapy, possible risk factors, and mandibular dose-volume effects in a large cohort of head and neck cancer patients (HNC). Methods: The cohort consisted of 1224 HNC patients treated with 66-68 Gy in 2007-2015 predominantly with IMRT. ORN cases were defined from clinical observations at follow-up and through hospital code diagnostics after oral-maxillofacial surgery and cross-checked with the national Danish Head and Neck Cancer database. In a nested case-control study, patients with ORN cases were matched with two controls (1:2) and pre-RT dental procedures including surgery to the mandible were documented. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was applied using demographic and treatment variables including dental procedures, smoking and tumor characteristics, and combined with dosimetric data. Mean mandibular dose (Dmean) was pre-selected for the multivariable model. Results: ORN was recorded in 56 cases (4.6%) with a median time to event of 10.9 months (range 1.8-89.7) after RT, 90% occurred within 37.4 months. Median follow-up time was 22 months (0.3-95). Average Dmean was significantly higher in the ORN event cohort and significant dose-volume differences were observed for population mean DVH doses between 30 Gy and 60 Gy. In univariable analysis, smoking (HR = 1.69; CI 1.14-2.5), pre-RT surgery/tooth extraction (HR = 2.76; 1.48-5.14), and several dosimetric parameters including Dmean (HR = 1.05, 1.02-1.08) were all significantly associated with ORN. Dmean and surgery/tooth extraction remained significant predictors of ORN in multivariable analysis, HR = 1.04 (CI 1.01-1.07) and HR = 2.09 (CI 1.1-3.98), respectively, while smoking only retained its significance in an interaction analysis with pre-RT dental procedures. Conclusion: The onset of ORN of the mandible was early (median 10.8 months) and the incidence low (4.6%) after IMRT in HNC cancer patients. Surgery to the mandible and pre-RT tooth extraction, tobacco smoking, and treatment dose were associated with the development of ORN.",Excluded,0.95509166
1046,"Environmental radioactivity and high incidence rates of stomach and esophagus cancer in the Van Lake Region: A causal relationship? This study examined the incidence rates of cancer cases (averages for 2006-2010) and relationships with environmental radioactivity levels. Soil and water samples were collected from provincial and district centers of Van city and the outdoor gamma doses were determined using a portable gamma scintillation detector. Gross alpha and beta, (226)Ra, (232)Th, and (40)K activities were measured in both tap water and soil samples. Although high rates of stomach and esophagus cancers have been reported previously in Van the underlying reasons have not hitherto been defined. Incidences of cancers were highest in the Gurpinar (326.0) and Ozalp (377.1) counties (p<0.001). As to the results of the gross alpha and gross beta radioactivity measurements in the drinking water, these two counties also had high beta radionuclide levels: Gurpinar (140 mBq/dm3) and Ozalp (206 mBq/dm3). Even if within the normal range, a relation between the higher rate of the incidence of stomach and esophagus cancers with that of the higher rate of beta radionuclide activity was clear. On Spearman correlation analysis, the relation between higher beta radionuclide levels and cancer incidence was found to be statistically significant (p<0.01). According to the results of the analysis, Van residents receive an average 1.86 mSv/y annual dose from outdoor gamma radiation, ingestion of radionuclides in the drinking water, and indoor 222Rn activity. Moreover, gross alpha and beta activities were found to be extremely high in all of the lakes around the city of Van, Turkey. Further investigations with long-term detailed environmental radiation measurements are needed regarding the relationship between cancer cases and environmental radioactivity in the city of Van.",Excluded,0.9546419

311,"The Impact of Hypoxia on Out-of-Field Cell Survival after Exposure to Modulated Radiation Fields Advanced radiotherapy techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy achieve highly conformal dose distributions within target tumor volumes through the sequential delivery of multiple spatially and temporally modulated radiation fields and have been shown to influence radiobiological response. The goals of this study were to determine the effect of hypoxia on the cell survival responses of different cell models (H460, DU145, A549, MDA231 and FADU) to modulated fields and to characterize the time dependency of signaling under oxic conditions, following reoxygenation and after prolonged hypoxia. Hypoxia was induced by incubating cells at 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide for 4 h prior to irradiation. The out-of-field response in MDA231 cells was oxygen dependent and therefore selected for co-culture studies to determine the signaling kinetics at different time intervals after irradiation under oxic and hypoxic conditions. Under both oxic and hypoxic conditions, significant increases in cell survival were observed in-field with significant decreases in survival observed out-of-field (P < 0.05), which were dependent on intercellular communication. The in-field response of MDA231 cells showed no significant time dependency up to 24 h postirradiation, while out-of-field survival decreased significantly during the first 6 h postirradiation (P < 0.05). While in-field responses were oxygen dependent, out-of-field effects were observed to be independent of oxygen, with similar or greater cell killing under hypoxic conditions. This study provides further understanding of intercellular signaling under hypoxic conditions and highlights the need for further refinement of established radiobiological models for future applications in advanced radiotherapies.",Excluded,0.9542201
250,"Environmental exposure to pyrethroids and sperm sex chromosome disomy: a cross-sectional study BACKGROUND: The role of environmental pesticide exposures, such as pyrethroids, and their relationship to sperm abnormalities are not well understood. This study investigated whether environmental exposure to pyrethroids was associated with altered frequency of sperm sex chromosome disomy in adult men.
METHODS: A sample of 75 subjects recruited through a Massachusetts infertility clinic provided urine and semen samples. Individual exposures were measured as urinary concentrations of three pyrethroid metabolites ((3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA), cis- and trans- 3-(2,2-Dichlorovinyl)-1-methylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (CDCCA and TDCCA)). Multiprobe fluorescence in situ hybridization for chromosomes X, Y, and 18 was used to determine XX, YY, XY, 1818, and total sex chromosome disomy in sperm nuclei. Poisson regression analysis was used to examine the association between aneuploidy rates and pyrethroid metabolites while adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: Between 25-56% of the sample were above the limit of detection (LOD) for the pyrethroid metabolites. All sex chromosome disomies were increased by 7-30% when comparing men with CDCCA and TDCCA levels above the LOD to those below the LOD. For 3PBA, compared to those below the LOD, those above the LOD had YY18 disomy rates 1.28 times higher (95% CI: 1.15, 1.42) whereas a reduced rate was seen for XY18 and total disomy (IRR = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.87; IRR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87-0.97), and no association was seen for XX18 and 1818.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that urinary concentrations of CDCCA and TDCCA above the LOD were associated with increased rates of aneuploidy. However the findings for 3BPA were not consistent. This is the first study to examine these relationships, and replication of our findings is needed before the association between pyrethroid metabolites and aneuploidy can be fully defined.",Excluded,0.9535705
458,"Assessment of internal exposure doses in Fukushima by a whole body counter within one month after the nuclear power plant accident Information on early internal radiation doses in Fukushima after the nuclear power plant accident on March 11, 2011, is quite limited due to initial organizational difficulties, high background radiation and contamination of radiation measuring devices. In Nagasaki, approximately 1,200 km away from Fukushima, the internal radioactivity in evacuees and short-term visitors to Fukushima has been measured by a whole body counter (WBC) since March 15, 2011. A horizontal bed-type scanning WBC equipped with two NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors was used for 173 people who stayed in the Fukushima prefecture between March 11 and April 10, 2011. The average length of stay was 4.8 days. The internal radioactivity was converted to an estimated amount of intake according to the scenario of acute inhalation, and then the committed effective dose and the thyroid dose were evaluated. 131I, 134Cs and 137Cs were detected in more than 30% of examined individuals. In subjects who stayed in Fukushima from March 12 to March 18, the detection rate was approximately 50% higher for each radionuclide and 44% higher for all three nuclides. The maximum committed effective dose and thyroid equivalent dose were 1 mSv and 20 mSv, respectively. Although the number of subjects and settlements in the study are limited, the results suggest that the internal radiation exposure in Fukushima due to the intake of radioactive materials shortly after the accident will probably not result in any deterministic or stochastic health effects. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.9532396
663,"Staff radiation dose and estimated risk in an interventional radiology department In interventional radiology attendant staff can be exposed to significant doses from the radiation scattered from the patient, giving rise to heterogeneous energy distribution, exposure occurring over extended periods of time. Protection of staff is a prime concern, also including reducing the risk of carcinogenesis. With only limited published studies available, as in for instance in regard to lens opacifications, further evaluation of staff exposures and assessment of radiation protection techniques and measures are crucial. Present study has sought to evaluate staff radiation exposure in a radiology department that performs interventional procedures. Annual occupational exposures were obtained for 32 personnel (6 females and 26 males) in a radiology department at a tertiary hospital. Personal dose equivalent Hp (d) was measured in terms of Hp (0.07) (shallow dose) and Hp (10) (deep dose). The measurements were made over a period of two consecutive years, 2017 and 2018, use being made of TLD-100 thermoluminescent dosimeters. In units of mSv, the corresponding average annual dose equivalent and range for Hp (10) and Hp (0.07) were 4.6 +/- 7.0 (0.1-25.5) and 5.1 +/- 7.3 (0.1-25.5). Notably, 16% of staff received doses that were greater than the annual dose limit. Since Hp (10) offers a conservative evaluation of effective dose, evaluation of the working environment is necessary in seeking to ensure dose values remain below annual dose limits.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded,0.95240426
345,"Recovery kinetics in mouse skin and CaNT tumours Recovery kinetics and recovery capacity were studied in a fast proliferating normal tissue, skin, and in an anaplastic mouse mammary carcinoma, CaNT. Three fractions per day of X-rays, repeated over 5 days, were given at varying interfraction intervals from 0 to 8 h. The rate of recovery in tumours (t1/2 = 0.31 +/- 0.15 h for local control) was significantly faster than in skin (t1/2 = 0.96 +/- 0.10 h). By contrast, the fractionation sensitivity of CaNT tumours was less than that of skin (alpha/beta = 43.3 +/- 8.5 Gy vs. alpha/beta = 7.9 +/- 0.2 Gy). Tissues with recovery half-times similar to or longer than that determined for skin would be at risk if interfraction intervals less than 6 h are used in regimes which involve the use of two or more fractions per day. This would be especially true for tissues that show a greater sensitivity to dose fractionation, and hence more sparing of radiation damage with hyperfractionation.",Excluded,0.9503818
777,"Predictors of Late Cardiovascular Complications in Survivors of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Long-term survival after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is now an expected outcome. The growing population of survivors is at risk of developing treatment-related complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). A nested case-controlled design was used to identify clinical and treatment-related risk factors for development of late (1+ years after HCT) CVD. Cases were identified from a cohort of 1+-year survivors who underwent transplantation at City of Hope between 1977 and 2006. Controls (HCT survivors without CVD) were matched on age, year of HCT, type of HCT, and duration of follow-up. Sixty-three patients with late CVD were identified, 44 (69.8%) with a coronary artery event and 19 (30.2%) with a cerebrovascular event. Median age at HCT was 49.0 years. Median age at onset of late CVD was 54.0 years; 66.7% of the affected patients had undergone autologous HCT. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors (2 or more of the following: obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes) after HCT was associated with a 5.2-fold increased risk of late CVD (P < .01), and that pre-HCT chest radiation exposure was associated with a 9.5-fold greater risk of coronary artery disease (P = .03). Pre-HCT exposure to chest radiation and the presence of comorbidities were primarily responsible for the risk associated with late CVD after HCT. These data form the basis for developing predictive models for identifying high-risk individuals for targeted surveillance and aggressive management of comorbidities. © 2010 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.",Excluded,0.94994164
760,"Factors affecting the quality of voice in the early glottic cancer treated with radiotherapy Aims: To prospectively analyze the objective voice quality before and after radiotherapy (RT) for early glottic cancer and to evaluate the role of different factors that may affect it. Method(s): Patients with T1-T2N0M0 glottic cancer underwent voice quality assessment before treatment and after radical RT. Post-RT voice quality was compared to the voice at diagnosis and the voice of healthy individuals used as controls. A comprehensive set of voice parameters were measured. The effects of age, smoking history, T stage, anterior commissure (AC) involvement, radiation dose, fractionation and volumes on pre-treatment and post-treatment voice quality were analyzed. Result(s): The voice quality data of 50 patients were analyzed. Following treatment, there was a significant improvement in the majority of measured parameters. However, perturbation and HNR remained inferior compared to controls. A history of smoking, AC involvement and larger RT volumes resulted in poorer voice parameters following RT. There was no significant impact of age alone. T2 tumors had an inferior voice quality before treatment, but did not remain inferior following RT. Hypofractionated RT did not show any negative impact. Conclusion(s): There is a considerable improvement of voice quality following RT. Several factors may have specific effects on pre-treatment and post-treatment voice. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

168,"Optimal adjuvant radiotherapy dose for stage I, II or III Merkel cell carcinoma: an analysis of the National Cancer Database BACKGROUND: We performed an analysis of the National Cancer Database to determine optimal doses of conventionally-fractionated adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with stage I/II or III Merkel cell carcinoma., METHODS: The cohort included 2735 patients with resected Merkel cell carcinoma of the head and neck, trunk or extremities receiving radiotherapy. Exclusion criteria included doses of radiotherapy <30 or >80 Gy, or dose per fraction >200 or <180 cGy. Recursive partitioning analysis and spline models were used to select dose thresholds. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to validate thresholds with respect to overall survival., RESULTS: Recursive partitioning analysis models defined a threshold of 57 Gy for stage I/II Merkel cell carcinoma, above which 3-year overall survival rate was decreased (P < 0.0001). The 3-year overall survival rate for patients receiving 50.0-57.0 Gy (81.2%) was greater compared to doses of 30.0-49.9 Gy (75.3%) or >57.0 Gy (70%, P < 0.0001). Doses > 57.0 Gy were associated with an increased hazard of death (1.31, confidence interval 1.07-1.60) with respect to doses of 50.0-57.0 Gy. Doses < 50.0 Gy for stage III Merkel cell carcinoma were associated with worsened 3-year overall survival (P < 0.0001) and increased hazard of death (2.01, confidence interval 1.43-2.82) with respect to doses between 50.0 and 57.0 Gy., CONCLUSIONS: Our results support doses of 50-57 Gy for most patients with stage I/II Merkel cell carcinoma receiving conventionally-fractionated adjuvant radiotherapy. In contrast to a prior National Cancer Database analysis, our results suggest doses >= 50 Gy should be strongly considered for patients with stage III Merkel cell carcinoma regardless of anatomic subsite.

835,"Do non-thermal electromagnetic fields cause nitrosative stress in male and female rats? Nitrosative stress occurs when the generations of highly Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS) such as nitric oxide (NO) exceed the ability of the human body to neutralize and eliminate them. It may lead to nitrosylation reactions that can alter protein structure by inhibiting normal body functions. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether RF Fields at non - thermal level can affect total NO (NOx) and antioxidant levels in plasma thus cause nitrosative stress. Twenty-four male and female Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Group I and Group II: male (n=6) and female (n=6) control groups, Group III and Group IV: male (n=6) and female (n=6) RF radiation exposed groups. The exposed groups of rats were exposed to non - thermal RF radiation 20 min/day for a month. NOx (nitrite/nitrate) levels were measured by Griess assay using Elisa reader. The total sulfhydryl (RSH) levels were determined spectrophotometrically by Kurtel method. The exposure to RF Radiation for a month caused significant increase in NOx plasma levels in male and female rats (p < 0.05). Conversely RSH levels were significantly lower in exposed rats compared to control rats (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in the rectal temperature between control and RF - irradiated rats (p > 0.05). In the present study, we showed that plasma NOx level may be increased in both male and female rats due to RF radiation exposure.

646,"Ex vivo radiosensitivity is increased in non-cancer patients taking valproate BACKGROUND: Valproate (VPA) is a commonly prescribed antiepileptic drug for patients experiencing epileptic seizures due to brain tumors. VPA increases radiation sensitivity in various tumor cells in vitro due to complex mechanisms. This could make tumors more vulnerable to ionizing radiation or overcome radioresistance. Yet, clinical data on possible improvement of tumor control by adding VPA to tumor therapy is controversial. Potentially radiosensitizing effects of VPA on healthy tissue remain unclear. To determine individual radiosensitivity, we analyzed blood samples of individuals taking VPA., METHODS: Ex vivo irradiated blood samples of 31 adult individuals with epilepsy were studied using 3-color fluorescence in situ hybridization. Aberrations in chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 were analyzed. Radiosensitivity was determined by the mean breaks per metaphase (B/M) and compared to age-matched (2:1) healthy donors., RESULTS: The patient cohort (n = 31; female: 38.7%) showed an increase of their average B/M value compared to healthy individuals (n = 61; female: 56.9%; B/M: 0.480 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.415 +/- 0.07; p = .001). The portion of radiosensitive (B/M > 0.500) and distinctly radiosensitive individuals (B/M > 0.600) was increased in the VPA group (54.9% vs. 11.3 and 9.7% vs. 0.0%; p < .001). In 3/31 patients, radiosensitivity was determined prior to and after VPA treatment and radiosensitivity was increased by VPA-treatment., CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we confirmed that patients treated with VPA had an increased radiosensitivity compared to the control group. This could be considered in patients taking VPA prior to the beginning of radiotherapy to avoid toxic side effects of VPA-treatment.",Excluded,0.9447442

Postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) is frequently recommended to improve survival outcome. The effect of PORT-associated morbidity on patients' quality of life (QOL) is, however, not well established. This study assessed the effect of PORT on medium-term (ie, at 6 months) QOL in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Methods. Patients completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life Questionnaire Core Head and Neck 35 (QLQ-HN35) at initial presentation, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Baseline QOL scores were adjusted for using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results. Global health status (mean difference = 13.3; p =.042) and xerostomia (mean difference = 35.4; p =.003) were significantly worse at 6 months in patients who received PORT compared to those treated with surgery alone. Conclusion. The survival advantage needs to be balanced against increased treatment toxicity.

751,"Lifetime attributable risk of cancer from CT among patients surviving severe traumatic brain injury OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the lifetime attributable risk of cancer from CT among patients surviving severe traumatic brain injury., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted with prospectively collected data on patients 16 years old and older admitted with a Glasgow coma scale score of 8 or less to a single level 1 trauma center from 2007 to 2010. The effective dose of each CT examination the patients underwent was predicted with literature-accepted effective dose values of standard helical CT protocols. The lifetime attributable risk of cancer and related mortality incurred as a result of CT were estimated with the cumulative effective dose incurred from the time of injury to a 1-year follow-up evaluation and with the approach established by the Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII report., RESULTS: The average patient was a 34-year-old man. The median number of CT examinations received during the first 12 months after injury was 20, and the average cumulative effective dose was 87 +/- 45 mSv. This resulted in increases in the lifetime incidence of all cancer types from 45.5% to 46.3% and in the lifetime incidence of cancer-related mortality from 22.1% to 22.5%., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure from the use of CT in the evaluation and management of severe traumatic brain injury causes negligible increases in lifetime attributable risk of cancer and cancer-related mortality.

Esters, acids and hydroperoxides were found under the surface of the EtO sterilised PEs up to 2 mm depth. The behaviour of gamma ray sterilised PEs is more complex due to the oxidation following the sterilisation process.

Then the thymus were taken out after the mice were decapitated. Thymus index, morphological characteristics of thymus were examined. The changes of thymus T-cell subgroups, cell cycle progression in thymocytes and cellular apoptosis were detected with flow cytometry (FCM). RESULT(S): The body weights of animals in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups [(28.10 +/- 1.46), (27.50 +/- 2.52) g] were lower than that of the control [(31.95 +/- 2.51) g] (P < 0.05). Pathological observation showed dark red piece of nucleus, some nuclei inclined to one side, slight increase in hassall body. The expressions of CD8 in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups (29.14% +/- 1.68%, 29.18% +/- 0.81%) were higher than that in control group (26.95% +/- 1.27%) (P < 0.05).

We constructed a whole genome radiation hybrid (RH) panel for yellowtail gene mapping and developed a framework physical map using a nanofluidic dynamic array to use SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in ESTs (expressed sequence tags) for the DNA-assisted breeding of yellowtail., RESULTS: Clonal RH cell lines were obtained after ionizing radiation; specifically, 78, 64, 129, 55, 42, and 53 clones were isolated after treatment with 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 8,000, or 10,000 rads, respectively. A total of 421 hybrid cell lines were obtained by fusion with mouse B78 cells. Ninety-four microsatellite markers used in the genetic linkage map were genotyped using the 421 hybrid cell lines. Based upon marker retention and genome coverage, we selected 93 hybrid cell lines to form an RH panel. Importantly, we performed the first genotyping of yellowtail markers in an RH panel using a nanofluidic dynamic array (Fluidigm, CA, USA). Then, 580 markers containing ESTs and SNPs were mapped in the first yellowtail RH map., CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed a yellowtail RH panel to facilitate the localization of markers. Using this, a framework RH map was constructed with 580 markers. This high-density physical map will serve as a useful tool for the identification of genes related to important breeding traits using genetic structural information, such as conserved synteny. Moreover, in a comparison of 30 sequences in the RH group 1 (SQ1), yellowtail appeared to be evolutionarily closer to medaka and the green-spotted pufferfish than to zebrafish. We suggest that synteny analysis may be potentially useful as a tool to investigate chromosomal evolution by comparison with model fish.",Excluded,0.87825537
443,Statistics of medical exposure in the USSR Statistical analysis of medical radiation exposure has been pursued in the USSR since 1970. Collection and evaluation of the diagnostic X ray exposure data are carried out at LIRH with a special computer program. Patient dose values are computed with due regard for the actual technical conditions of X ray procedures. The mean per caput effective dose equivalent from diagnostic radiology in Russia in 1986 was estimated at 1.2 mSv,Excluded,0.8385326

195,"A system for in vivo measurement of bone calcium by local neutron activation of the hand A 252Cf neutron-irradiation facility designed specifically for clinical in vivo measurement of calcium in the hand is described. Results of preliminary measurements are presented. Hand phantoms were exposed to the neutron beam for 10 min and the induced 49Ca activities were counted for 10 min after an elapsed time of 2 min. The results indicate that with a 2 X 100 micrograms 252Cf neutron source and two 20.3 X 12.7 cm NaI crystals, the counts per gram of bone mineral mass changes by about 4% for each 100 cm3 change in the overall volume (soft tissue plus bone) of the hand. For hands of equal volumes the counts per gram are expected to be almost independent of the bone volume. With an absorbed dose equivalent of 150 mSv (15 rem), the sensitivity is about 200 counts per 10 min per gram Ca. The statistical reproducibility of the results is better than 3% for the average value of 11 g Ca in the normal hand.",Excluded,0.7471381
756,"Proton radiobiology and uncertainties This paper briefly reviews proton radiobiology. Clinical applications of protons produced by accelerators have led to a significant biological literature that contributes to our goal of estimating the proton shielding requirements for human interplanetary missions. Protons are primarily a low-LET radiation with biological effects much like gamma radiation. There are however data indicating enhanced biological effectiveness for small doses of very low energy (<10 MeV) stopping protons, and some limited data for extremely high energy protons (>0.5 GeV).",Excluded,0.7142913
1089,"Correlation between normal tissue complications and in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts derived from radiotherapy patients treated for variety of tumors PURPOSE: To assess the relationship between fibroblast intrinsic radiosensitivity in vitro and late reactions of normal tissues in patients treated by definitive radiotherapy for variety of tumors., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients were selected for this study. They were treated by radical radiotherapy for variety of tumors, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate, glottic larynx, anal canal, cervix, bladder, thyroid gland, and tonsil pillar. Five patients did not develop any significant late reactions (normally sensitive group, NS). The other five developed late complications in different normal tissues and organs that proved to be fatal in one patient (clinically hyper-sensitive group, HS). Fibroblast cultures were established from punch skin biopsy and radiosensitivity in vitro was measured. The survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) was calculated and compared between the two groups., RESULTS: SF2 ranged between 0.10 and 0.38 with a mean of 0.24. The mean SF2 for each of the NS and the HS groups were 0.31 and 0.17, respectively. The non-parametric rank test of Mann-Whitney shows that the difference between the two groups is statistically significant (p = 0.01)., CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts is correlated with late complications in different organs and normal tissues following radiotherapy for variety of tumors. It also lends support to the existence of a common genetic component determining the radiosensitivity of cells targeted by the late effects of ionizing radiation.",Excluded,0.70749116
594,"Myocardial infarction mortality risk after treatment for hodgkin disease: A collaborative British cohort study Background Myocardial infarction is a major cause of excess long-term mortality in survivors of Hodgkin disease, but limited information exists on the effects of specific chemotherapy regimens used to treat these patients on their risk of death from myocardial infarction. Methods We followed a cohort of 7033 Hodgkin disease patients who were treated in Britain from November 1, 1967, through September 30, 2000, and compared their risk of myocardial infarction mortality with that in the general population of England and Wales. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results A total of 166 deaths from myocardial infarction occurred in the cohort, statistically significantly more than expected(standardized mortality ratio[SMR] = 2.5, 95% confidence interval[CI] = 2.1 to 2.9), with an absolute excess risk of 125.8 per 100000 person-years. Standardized mortality ratios decreased sharply with older age at first treatment, but absolute excess risks of death from myocardial infarction increased with older age up to age 65 years at first treatment. The statistically significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction mortality persisted through to 25 years after first treatment. Risks were increased statistically significantly and independently for patients who had been treated with supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy, anthracyclines, or vincristine. Risk was particularly high for patients treated with the doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine regimen(SMR = 9.5, 95% CI = 3.5 to 20.6). Risk at 20 or more years after first treatment was particularly great for patients who had received supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy and vincristine without anthracylines(SMR = 14.8, 95% CI = 4.8 to 34.5). Conclusions The risk of death from myocardial infarction after treatment for Hodgkin disease remains high for at least 25 years. The increased risks are related to supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy but may also be related to anthracycline and vincristine treatment.",Excluded,0.68859404

478,"Chromosome sensitivity to bleomycin in G<inf>2</inf> lymphocytes from Down syndrome patients Several studies have demonstrated that lymphocytes from patients with Down syndrome (DS) exhibit an increased frequency of chromosome aberrations when they are exposed to ionizing radiation or to chemicals at the G<inf>0</inf> or G<inf>1</inf> phases of the cell cycle, but not at G<inf>2</inf> when compared to normal subjects. To determine the susceptibility of DS lymphocytes at G<inf>2</inf> phase, bleomycin, a radiomimetic agent, was used to induce DNA breaks in blood cultures from 24 Down syndrome patients. All the patients with DS showed free trisomy 21 (47,XX + 21 or 47,XY + 21). Individuals that showed an average number of chromatid breaks per cell higher than 0.8 were considered sensitive to the drug. No control child showed susceptibility to bleomycin, and among the 24 patients with DS, only one was sensitive to the drug. No significant difference was observed between the two groups, regarding chromatid break frequencies in treated G<inf>2</inf> lymphocytes. The distribution of bleomycin-induced breaks in each group of chromosomes was similar for DS and controls. No significant difference was found in the response to bleomycin between male and female subjects. Probably, the main factor involved in chromosome sensitivity of lymphocytes from patients with DS is the phase of the cell cycle in which the cell is treated.",Excluded,0.6023844
984,"Cancer incidence in professional flight crew and air traffic control officers: disentangling the effect of occupational versus lifestyle exposures Flight crew are occupationally exposed to several potentially carcinogenic hazards; however, previous investigations have been hampered by lack of information on lifestyle exposures. The authors identified, through the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority medical records, a cohort of 16,329 flight crew and 3,165 air traffic control officers (ATCOs) and assembled data on their occupational and lifestyle exposures. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated to compare cancer incidence in each occupation to that of the general population; internal analyses were conducted by fitting Cox regression models. All-cancer incidence was 20-29% lower in each occupation than in the general population, mainly due to a lower incidence of smoking-related cancers [SIR (95% CI) = 0.33 (0.27-0.38) and 0.42 (0.28-0.60) for flight crew and ATCOs, respectively], consistent with their much lower prevalence of smoking. Skin melanoma rates were increased in both flight crew (SIR = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.45-2.38) and ATCOs (2.66; 1.55-4.25), with rates among the former increasing with increasing number of flight hours (p-trend = 0.02). However, internal analyses revealed no differences in skin melanoma rates between flight crew and ATCOs (hazard ratio: 0.78, 95% CI = 0.37-1.66) and identified skin that burns easily when exposed to sunlight (p = 0.001) and sunbathing to get a tan (p = 0.07) as the strongest risk predictors of skin melanoma in both occupations. The similar site-specific cancer risks between the two occupational groups argue against risks among flight crew being driven by occupation-specific exposures. The skin melanoma excess reflects sun-related behaviour rather than cosmic radiation exposure. Copyright © 2012 UICC.",Excluded,0.5923423

Despite decades of epidemiologic study, the known and suspected risk factors for leukemia are insufficient to explain more than a small fraction of the observed variation in the occurrence of the leukemias. Important contributions to the literature in 1993 included studies further clarifying the role of known risk factors (ionizing radiation, certain chemotherapeutic agents, and specific occupational chemical exposures) and suspected risk factors (infectious agents, electromagnetic fields, cigarette smoking, other chemotherapeutic agents, and additional occupational chemical exposures) in leukemogenesis.",Excluded,0.5550011
