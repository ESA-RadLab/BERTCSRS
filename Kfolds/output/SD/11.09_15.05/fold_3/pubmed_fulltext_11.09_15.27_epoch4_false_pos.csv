811,"Effects of beta radiation from organically bound tritium on cultured mouse embryonic mid brain cells Effects of beta radiation from four kinds of organically bound tritium compounds were investigated on cultured mouse embryonic mid brain cells, isolated from 11-d-old mouse embryos. The MBC showed a critical time when they were more radiosensitive. Although dose-dependent inhibition was found for both cellular proliferation and differentiation, the differentiation was more sensitive to radiation than proliferation when compared at ID50, the inhibitory dose that reduced assessment value by 50% of the control. Dose-dependent decrease of DNA and protein contents were also observed. The relative biological effectiveness values, ranging from 4.6 to 8.7, of beta ray from organically bound tritium compounds were obtained when compared with x irradiation at their ID50s on the inhibition of cell proliferation and differentiation, and on the decrease of DNA and protein contents of the cultures. The mixed exposure to x ray and one kind of organically bound tritium compound or to any two kinds of organically bound tritium compound resulted in a more efficiently inhibitory effect on differentiation than the exposure to x ray or to any one kind of organically bound tritium compound alone, especially when methyl-3H-thymidine was used. Doses as low as 0.05 Gy (5 cGy) from a mixed exposure resulted in detectable inhibitory effects.",Excluded,0.9522381
172,"Evaluation of the genotoxic effects of chronic low-dose ionizing radiation exposure on nuclear medicine workers INTRODUCTION: Nuclear medicine workers are occupationally exposed to chronic ionizing radiation. It is known that ionizing radiation may have damaging effects on chromosomes. In the present study, we investigated the genotoxic effects of ionizing radiation on nuclear medicine workers. We used two different indicators of genotoxicity methods: sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronucleus (MN)., METHODS: The present research was carried out using 21 nuclear medicine workers (11 females and 10 males) during two periods: during normal working conditions and after a 1-month vacation. The radiation dose varied from 1.20 to 48.56 mSv, which accumulated during the occupational exposure time between two vacations. Peripheral blood samples were taken from each subject for two distinct lymphocyte cultures (SCE and MN) in each period., RESULTS: In nearly all subjects, SCE values increased significantly during radiation exposure compared to the postvacation period (P<.05). Similarly, MN frequencies in most of the subjects increased significantly during radiation exposure compared to the postvacation period (P<.05)., CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that both SCE and MN frequencies in most of the subjects were significantly higher during exposure to ionizing radiation than after a 1-month vacation period. However, this genotoxic effect was reversible in most of the subjects.",Excluded,0.95217806
631,"[X-ray-induced breaks in the X chromosomes in Drosophila lines of various radiosensitivities] The frequency of X-ray induced X-chromosome breaks has been studied in females of the line rad (2) 201G1 hypersensitive to radiation and in females of the control line selected from the same population. The frequency of X-chromosome breaks was judged based on the frequency of X0 males occurrence. Synergism of the effects of X-rays (at doses 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 kr) and of hyperthermia (+37 degrees C, 5.5 hours) applied after irradiation served as an indirect evidence for the functioning of DNA repair systems. It is demonstrated that radiosensitivity of mature oocytes of the lines compared was equal and that hyperthermia applied after irradiation increased the latter effect in both lines. Young oocytes of the control line were radioresistant, and hyperthermia applied after irradiation enhanced its effect. Opposite to them, young oocytes of the rad line females were radiosensitive. They did not differ from mature oocytes in the frequency of X-chromosome losses. Synergism of the two factors (irradiation and hyperthermia) was not registered in young oocytes. On the basis of the results obtained, it may be concluded that radiosensitivity of young oocytes in the hypersensitive line is conditioned by the failure of DNA repair systems and that the rad (2) 201G1 gene may be considered, in relation to the genes controlling DNA repair, as a suppressor functioning selectively at a certain stage of oogenesis.",Excluded,0.9521035
695,"Induction of micronuclei in human sperm-hamster egg hybrids at the two-cell stage after in vitro gamma-irradiation of human spermatozoa The efficiency of the micronucleus test to assess radiation-induced chromosomal damage in human spermatozoa has been investigated. Micronuclei were scored in human sperm-hamster egg hybrids at the two-cell stage, after exposure of human spermatozoa to in vitro gamma-rays at doses of 0.00, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, and 4.00 Gy. The relationship between the yield of micronuclei per two-cell stage as well as the percentage of two-cell stages with micronuclei and the different doses of irradiation were fitted to linear equations. To evaluate whether scoring micronuclei is useful for the quantification of chromosomal damage occurring in human spermatozoa, induced micronuclei at the different doses of sperm irradiation were compared to the induction of breaks and fragments in sperm-derived chromosomes. After interspecific fertilization of zona-free hamster oocytes by irradiated spermatozoa, a total of 699 fertilized eggs at the two-cell stage and a total of 387 sperm-derived complements were analyzed. The incidence of fertilized eggs with micronuclei at the two-cell stage coincided well with the incidence of sperm-derived chromosome breaks and fragments (e.g., 8.9% vs. 6.7% in the 0.25 Gy group and 52.8% vs. 58.6% in the 4.00 Gy group). A similar correlation was found between the number of micronuclei per two-cell stage and the number of breaks and fragments per sperm complement (0.09 vs. 0.07 in the 0.25 Gy group and 0.71 vs. 0.81 in the 4.00 Gy group). The results show that this test system can be used for the quantification of spontaneous or induced chromosomal damage in human spermatozoa.",Excluded,0.95206213
422,"Altered proliferation and differentiation of human epidermis in cases of skin fibrosis after radiotherapy PURPOSE: To characterize, at the histopathologic and molecular levels, the irradiated epidermis in cases of human skin fibrosis induced by radiotherapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Surgical samples were obtained from 6 patients who had developed cutaneous fibronecrotic lesions from 7 months to 27 years after irradiation. The proliferation and differentiation status of the irradiated epidermis was characterized with specific markers using immunohistochemical methods., RESULTS: All samples presented with hyperplasia of the epidermis associated with local inflammation. The scar epidermis exhibited an increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which revealed hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Furthermore, an abnormal differentiation was found, characterized by the expression of K6 and K16, and by alterations in protein amounts and localization of cytokeratins, involucrin, and transforming growth factor-beta1., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that late damage of irradiated skin is not only characterized by fibrosis in the dermis but also by hyperplasia in the epidermis. This hyperplasia was due to both hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes.",Excluded,0.9519817
247,"The radiologic technologists' health study in South Korea: study design and baseline results PURPOSE: To describe the study design, methods, and baseline results of a prospective cohort of radiologic technologists which we have initiated in South Korea., METHODS: The cohort participants were enrolled through a self-administered questionnaire survey administered from April 2012 to May 2013. Survey data were linked with radiation dosimetry, a cancer registry, and health insurance data by personal identification numbers. A nationwide representative survey was also conducted using a stratified random sampling design with face-to-face interviews., RESULTS: A total of 12,387 radiologic technologists were enrolled, which accounted for approximately 63% of all diagnostic radiologic technologists working in South Korea. For nationwide survey, 585 workers were interviewed using the detailed questionnaire, and buccal cells were also collected by scraping the inside of the cheek. The majority of study subjects were under 50-year-old and male workers. The average annual effective dose of radiation declined both men (from 2.75 to 1.43 mSv) and women (from 1.34 to 0.95 mSv) over the period of 1996-2011. A total of 99 cancers (66 cancers in men and 33 in women) were reported from 1992 to 2010. The standardized incidence ratio of all cancer combined was significantly lower in men (SIR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96) than general population, but the ratios for thyroid cancer were significantly higher than expected among both men and women., CONCLUSIONS: This cohort provides comprehensive information on work activities and health status of diagnostic radiologic technologists. In addition, the nationwide representative sample provides unique opportunities compared with previous radiologic technologist studies.",Excluded,0.9519256
618,"Inter-laboratory comparison of cytogenetic endpoints for the biomonitoring of radiological workers Purpose: The evaluation of different cytogenetic endpoints of radiation damage for the biomonitoring of contract workers temporarily employed at nuclear power plants. Material(s) and Method(s): Blood samples from six donors were irradiated in vitro with doses ranging from 0.1 to 2 Gy 60Co gamma-rays. Compared were a conventional analysis for dicentrics, the conventional micronucleus (MN) assay, the centromere micronucleus assay using p82H and an alphaAllCen pancentromeric probe, and tricolour FISH with chromosome 2, 4 and 8 DNA probes for the scoring of translocations. Result(s): Agreement in the number of MN between Giemsa-and propidium iodine fluorescence-stained preparations was obtained. The control samples showed higher centromere positivity for the MN after FISH with the p82H probe compared with the alphaAllCen probe. The MN results with both probes showed a slight but systematic increase in the number of centromere-positive MN with dose, indicating that radiation, although principally clastogenic, also has aneuploidogenic properties. The values of the genomic translocation frequency (F(G)) derived from the observed translocation frequencies were systematically higher than the dicentric yields. Comparing the sensitivity of the different methods with restriction of the scoring time to 1 day for biomonitoring purposes, the centromere micronucleus assay had the lowest dose detection limit (0.1 to 0.2 Gy). Conclusion(s): This study shows that at present only the centromere micronucleus assay can combine high sensitivity with a reasonable scoring time for the biomonitoring of relatively large populations.",Excluded,0.9518772
504,"Mortality among individuals exposed to atomic bomb radiation in utero: 1950-2012 We examined the mortality risks among 2463 individuals who were exposed in utero to atomic bomb radiation in Hiroshima or Nagasaki in August 1945 and were followed from October 1950 through 2012. Individual estimates of mother's weighted absorbed uterine dose (DS02R1) were used. Poisson regression method was used to estimate the radiation-associated excess relative risk per Gy (ERR/Gy) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cause-specific mortality. Head size, birth weight, and parents' survival status were evaluated as potential mediators of radiation effect. There were 339 deaths (216 males and 123 females) including deaths from solid cancer (n = 137), lymphohematopoietic cancer (n = 8), noncancer disease (n = 134), external cause (n = 56), and unknown cause (n = 4). Among males, the unadjusted ERR/Gy (95% CI) was increased for noncancer disease mortality (1.22, 0.10-3.14), but not for solid cancer mortality (- 0.18, < - 0.77-0.95); the unadjusted ERR/Gy for external cause mortality was not statistically significant (0.28, < - 0.60-2.36). Among females, the unadjusted ERRs/Gy were increased for solid cancer (2.24, 0.44-5.58), noncancer (2.86, 0.56-7.64), and external cause mortality (2.57, 0.20-9.19). The ERRs/Gy adjusted for potential mediators did not change appreciably for solid cancer mortality, but decreased notably for noncancer mortality (0.39, < - 0.43-1.91 for males; 1.48, - 0.046-4.55 for females) and external cause mortality (0.10, < - 0.57-1.96 for males; 1.38, < - 0.46-5.95 for females). In conclusion, antenatal radiation exposure is a consistent risk factor for increased solid cancer mortality among females, but not among males. The effect of exposure to atomic bomb radiation on noncancer disease and external cause mortality among individuals exposed in utero was mediated through small head size, low birth weight, and parental loss.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.9518721
317,"Dose-dependent expression of CLIP2 in post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid carcinomas A previous study on papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) in young patients who were exposed to 131iodine from the Chernobyl fallout revealed an exclusive gain of chromosomal band 7q11.23 in exposed cases compared to an age-matched control cohort. CLIP2, a gene located within band 7q11.23 was shown to be differentially expressed between exposed and non-exposed cases at messenger RNA and protein level. Therefore, a standardized procedure for CLIP2 typing of PTCs has been developed in a follow-up study. Here we used CLIP2 typing data on 117 post-Chernobyl PTCs from two cohorts of exposed patients with individual dose estimates and 24 non-exposed controls to investigate a possible quantitative dose-response relationship of the CLIP2 marker. The 'Genrisk-T' cohort consisted of 45 PTCs and the 'UkrAm' cohort of 72 PTCs. Both cohorts differed in mean dose (0.59 Gy Genrisk-T, 1.2 Gy UkrAm) and mean age at exposure (AaE) (2 years Genrisk-T, 8 years UkrAm), whilst the median latency (16 years Genrisk-T, 18 years UkrAm) was comparable. We analyzed the association between the binary CLIP2 typing and continuous thyroid dose with logistic regression. A clear positive dose-response relationship was found for young PTC cases [age at operation (AaO) < 20 years, AaE < 5 years]. In the elder age group a higher proportion of sporadic tumors is assumed due to a negligible dose response, suggesting different molecular mechanisms in sporadic and radiation-induced cases. This is further supported by the association of elder patients (AaO > 20 years) with positivity for BRAF V600E mutation.Copyright © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

476,"Reciprocal translocations as an indicator for radiation exposures in the low dose range A few years back, the frequency of dicentrics was determined shortly after exposure in five accidentally exposed radiation workers. In all cases the observed dicentric yield was significantly higher in comparison with the background level, and the resulting estimated whole body doses lay between 0.2 and 0.3 Gy. Now, a number of years later (1 to 11 years), the frequency of translocations has been determined by means of the FISH technique. Chromosomes 2, 4 and 8 were painted. The measured translocation frequency lay, however, within the range of the spontaneous variation between individuals. No radiation exposure could, therefore, be proven. In two further cases, the dicentrics were determined by means of the conventional Giemsa staining technique, and the translocations by means of chromosome painting carried out on the same blood samples, which were taken about 3 and 10 years, respectively, after the radiation exposure. The dose estimates obtained on the basis of dicentric frequency using the Qdr method, and on the basis of FISH detected translocations, are compared.

857,"Radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes after partial-body exposure to 60Co gamma-irradiation and in vitro exposure to 230 kV X-irradiation Small yields of chromosome aberrations were present in lymphocytes from 12 patients observed at first metaphase in culbure. Blood samples were obtained at various times, up to three days, after single partial-body therapeutic exposure ranging from 75 to 400 rads of 60Co gamma-irradiation. When all patients were considered there was no correlation between treatment dose and aberration frequency, but on subdivision into two groups on the basis of whether the reticuloendothelial system was involved in the cancer, linear regression analysis could be fitted to the data for each group. An in vitro dose response curve for dicentrics induced by 230 kV X rays at a dose rate of 23.3 rads per minute was constructed for use as a standard calibration curve for 48 hour cultures. The yield of dicentric aberrations was best fitted by a power law model, Y = kDn in which k = (1.59 +/- 0.66) 10(-4) and n= 1.49 +/- 0.08, (P =0.96).",Excluded,0.95181173
313,"HPRT-mutant frequency and lymphocyte characteristics of workers exposed to ionizing radiation on a sporadic basis: a comparison of two exposure indicators, job title and dose Using the clonal HPRT-mutant frequency assay, mutant frequencies of humans have been shown to rise following exposure to large doses of mutagens during radiotherapy, chemotherapy or after an atom bomb explosion. Success in relating mutant frequencies to exposure to high levels of mutagens has encouraged researchers to examine the effects of lower doses, such as those found among workers exposed at their jobs. In order to relate low doses of mutagens to biological effects, accurate characterization of exposure is critical, but most occupational studies are forced to use gross measures of exposure derived from job title or professional judgments as to potential exposure. Mutant frequencies and other relevant lymphocyte characteristics of 58 industrial workers were related to exposure status in two ways. When workers were classed as ""exposed"" or ""unexposed"" to ionizing radiation, no difference in any biological variable was seen between the two groups. When dosimeter readings were used as the exposure indicator, significant relationships appeared between dose and mutant frequency and CD4/CD8 lymphocyte subpopulation ratios. Mutant frequency was also positively related to age and smoking status. The time course of exposure and of appearance of mutant cells is discussed and it is suggested that this relationship receive attention in occupational studies of genotoxic effects.",Excluded,0.9517983
184,"Lack of high-dose radiation mediated prostate cancer promotion and low-dose radiation adaptive response in the TRAMP mouse model Cancer of the prostate is a highly prevalent disease with a heterogeneous aetiology and prognosis. Current understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the responses of prostate tissue to ionizing radiation exposure, including cancer induction, is surprisingly limited for both high- and low-dose exposures. As population exposure to radiation increases, largely through medical imaging, a better understanding of the response of the prostate to radiation exposure is required. Low-dose radiation-induced adaptive responses for increased cancer latency and decreased cancer frequency have been demonstrated in mouse models, largely for hematological cancers. This study examines the effects of high- and low-dose whole-body radiation exposure on prostate cancer development using an autochthonous mouse model of prostate cancer: TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP). TRAMP mice were exposed to single acute high (2 Gy), low (50 mGy) and repeated low (5 x 50 mGy) doses of X rays to evaluate both the potential prostate cancer promoting effects of high-dose radiation and low-dose adaptive response phenomena in this prostate cancer model. Prostate weights and histopathology were examined to evaluate gross changes in cancer development and, in mice exposed to a single 2 Gy dose, time to palpable tumor was examined. Proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis, DNA damage (gamma-H2AX) and transgene expression (large T-antigen) were examined within TRAMP prostate sections. Neither high- nor low-dose radiation-induced effects on prostate cancer progression were observed for any of the endpoints studied. Lack of observable effects of high- or low-dose radiation exposure suggests that modulation of tumorigenesis in the TRAMP model is largely resistant to such exposures. However, further study is required to better assess the effects of radiation exposure using alternative prostate cancer models that incorporate normal prostate and in those that are not driven by SV40 large T antigen. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.951785
617,"Biological dosimetry using the micronucleus assay for lymphocytes: interindividual differences in dose response The dose response of the number of micronuclei in cytokinesis-blocked lymphocytes after in-vitro irradiation of whole blood with x rays in the dose range 0-4 Gy was studied for a heterogeneous population of 10 donors. One thousand binucleated cells were systematically scored for micronuclei. A linear-quadratic dose dependency of the micronucleus yields was observed. The data were used to derive the accuracy of the dose assessment with the technique in case of a radiation accident. It was shown that for doses of 2 Gy and higher, the uncertainty of the dose was predominantly due to interindividual differences in the x-ray-induced micronucleus yields. At the 95% confidence level, doses lower than 0.3 Gy could not be unequivocally detected with the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay due to the variability of the baseline micronucleus frequency within the donor population and the poor statistical accuracy when scoring 1,000 cells. The precision and sensitivity of the method in the low-dose range could be improved by the knowledge of individual pre-irradiation baseline values and an increase of the number of cells scored by automation of the technique.",Excluded,0.951768
227,"Detrimental effects of electron beam irradiation on the cowpea bruchid Callosobruchus maculatus BACKGROUND: Electron beam (eBeam) irradiation technology is an environmentally friendly, chemical-free alternative for disinfesting insect pests of stored grains. The underlying hypothesis is that specific doses of eBeam will have defined detrimental effects on the different life stages. We evaluated the effects of eBeam exposure in a range of doses (0.03-0.12 kGy) on the development of the cowpea bruchid (Callosobruchus maculatus) at various stages of its life cycle., RESULTS: Differential radiosensitivity was detected during egg development. Early and intermediate stages of eggs never hatched after exposure to a dose of 0.03 kGy, whereas a substantial portion of black-headed (i.e. late) eggs survived irradiation even at 0.12 kGy. However, further development of the hatched larvae was inhibited. Although midgut protein digestion remained intact, irradiated larvae (0.06 kGy or higher) failed to develop into normal living adults; rather, they died as pupae or abnormally eclosed adults, suggesting a detrimental effect of eBeam on metamorphosis. Emerged irradiated pupae had shorter longevity and were unable to produce any eggs at 0.06 kGy or higher. At this dose range, eggs laid by irradiated adults were not viable. eBeam treatment shortened adult longevity in a dose-dependent manner. Reciprocal crosses indicated that females were more sensitive to eBeam exposure than their male counterparts. Dissection of the female reproductive system revealed that eBeam treatment prevented formation of oocytes., CONCLUSION: eBeam irradiation has very defined effects on cowpea bruchid development and reproduction. A dose of 0.06 kGy could successfully impede cowpea burchid population expansion. This information can be exploited for post-harvest insect control of stored grains.

816,"Hormonal suppression restores fertility in irradiated mice from both endogenous and donor-derived stem spermatogonia Irradiation interrupts spermatogenesis and causes prolonged sterility in male mammals. Hormonal suppression treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues has restored spermatogenesis in irradiated rats, but similar attempts were unsuccessful in irradiated mice, monkeys, and humans. In this study, we tested a stronger hormonal suppression regimen (the GnRH antagonist, acyline, and plus flutamide) for efficacy both in restoring endogenous spermatogenesis and in enhancing colonization of transplanted stem spermatogonia in mouse testes irradiated with a total doses between 10.5 and 13.5 Gy. A 4-week hormonal suppression treatment, given immediately after irradiation, increased endogenous spermatogenic recovery 1.5-fold, and 11-week hormonal suppression produced twofold increases compared with sham-treated irradiated controls. Furthermore, 10-week hormonal suppression restored fertility from endogenous surviving spermatogonial stem cells in 90% of 10.5-Gy irradiated mice, whereas only 10% were fertile without hormonal suppression. Four-and 11-week hormonal suppression also enhanced spermatogenic development from transplanted stem spermatogonia in irradiated recipient mice, by 3.1-and 4.8-fold, respectively, compared with those not given hormonal treatment. Moreover, the 10-week hormonal suppression regimen, but not a sham treatment, restored fertility of some 13.5-Gy irradiated recipient mice from donor-derived spermatogonial stem cells. This is the first report of hormonal suppression inducing recovery of endogenous spermatogenesis and fertility in a mouse model treated with anticancer agents. The combination of spermatogonial transplantation with hormonal suppression should be investigated as a treatment to restore fertility in young men after cytotoxic cancer therapy. © The Author 2010.

1040,"Radiation-dose response of glycophorin A somatic mutation in erythrocytes associated with gene polymorphisms of p53 binding protein 1 Information on individual variations in response to ionizing radiation is still quite limited. Previous studies of atomic-bomb survivors revealed that somatic mutations at the glycophorin A (GPA) gene locus in erythrocytes were significantly elevated with radiation exposure dose, and that the dose response was significantly higher in survivors with subsequent cancer development compared to those without cancer development. Noteworthy in these studies were great inter-individual differences in GPA mutant fraction even in persons with similar radiation doses. It is hypothesized that persistent GPA mutations in erythrocytes of atomic-bomb survivors are derived from those in long-lived hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations, and that individual genetic backgrounds, specifically related to DNA double-strand break repair, contribute to individual differences in HSC mutability following radiation exposure. Thus, we examined the relationship between radiation exposure, GPA mutant fraction in erythrocytes, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the key gene involved in DNA double-strand break repair, p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1). 53BP1 SNPs and inferred haplotypes demonstrated a significant interaction with radiation dose, suggesting that radiation-dose response of GPA somatic mutation is partly dependent on 53BP1 genotype. It is also possible that 53BP1 plays a significant role in DNA double-strand break repair in HSCs following radiation exposure. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.9516763

The immunogenicity of irradiated blood parasites for intact cattle and splenectomised calves Intraerythrocytic forms of B. bovis were exposed to 350 Grays (Gy) gamma irradiation and were then injected intravenously into intact two and three year old Hereford steers. One of 15 steers died on initial infection and subsequently six steers were given a virulent heterologous challenge three weeks after recovery; all six animals were highly immune. The remaining eight animals were kept under quarantine conditions for 10 months and were then challenged with a different virulent heterologous strain of B. bovis. Seven of eight were highly immune, but one animal died. Subsequently a further 12 steers were injected intravenously with 1 X 10(8) irradiated organisms. All showed only mild transient clinical signs. After 12 months quarantine in a tick-free area these animals were then challenged with a virulent heterologous strain and all 12 were shown to be highly immune. Irradiation reduced the infective dose from 1 X 10(8) to 2.5 X 10(3) parasites. These parasites multiplied at the same rate, and achieved the same maximum parasitaemia as the parent non-irradiated strain, but the disease produced by them was not severe. A dose of 2.5 X 10(3) non-irradiated parasites was lethal to all of the four animals which received it.

We analysed the changes of HGF protein levels in rat lung following 12 Gy of whole thoracic irradiation. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was then collected from 11 patients (10 lung cancer and one oesophageal cancer) after completion of radiation therapy. One month after irradiation, the HGF protein level in the lungs of irradiated rats decreased (p<0.05), followed by a remarkable elevation in HGF protein levels 2 (p<0.05) and 3 months (nonsignificant) after irradiation accompanied by the clinical appearance of radiation pneumonitis. Finally, HGF protein levels in the lung returned to their original level 6 months after thoracic irradiation. In humans, HGF protein levels in the BALF in the limited irradiated area were lower than those obtained from unirradiated areas (p<0.05).

129,"Comparative study of DNA damage and repair in head and neck cancer after radiation treatment We compared DNA damage and the efficacy of its repair after genotoxic treatment with gamma-radiation of lymphocytes and tissue cells isolated from patients with squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (HNSCC) and healthy donors. Thirty-seven subjects with HNSCC and 35 healthy donors were enrolled in the study. The extent of DNA damage including oxidative lesions and efficiency of the repair were examined by alkaline comet assay. HNSCC cancer cells were more sensitive to genotoxic treatment and displayed impaired DNA repair. In particular, lesions caused by gamma-radiation were repaired less effectively in metastasis of HNSCC than in healthy controls. The differences in radiation sensitivity of cancer and control cells suggested that DNA repair might be critical for HNSCC treatment. We conclude that gamma-radiation might be considered as an effective therapeutic strategy for head and neck cancers, including patients in advanced stage of the disease with clear evidence of metastasis.",Excluded,0.95148957
41,"Estimation of background radiation doses for the Peninsular Malaysia's population by ESR dosimetry of tooth enamel Background radiation dose is used in dosimetry for estimating occupational doses of radiation workers or determining radiation dose of an individual following accidental exposure. In the present study, the absorbed dose and the background radiation level are determined using the electron spin resonance (ESR) method on tooth samples. The effect of using different tooth surfaces and teeth exposed with single medical X-rays on the absorbed dose are also evaluated. A total of 48 molars of position 6-8 were collected from 13 district hospitals in Peninsular Malaysia. Thirty-six teeth had not been exposed to any excessive radiation, and 12 teeth had been directly exposed to a single X-ray dose during medical treatment prior to extraction. There was no significant effect of tooth surfaces and exposure with single X-rays on the measured absorbed dose of an individual. The mean measured absorbed dose of the population is 34 +/- 6.2 mGy, with an average tooth enamel age of 39 years. From the slope of a regression line, the estimated annual background dose for Peninsular Malaysia is 0.6 +/- 0.3 mGy y(-1). This value is slightly lower than the yearly background dose for Malaysia, and the radiation background dose is established by ESR tooth measurements on samples from India and Russia.",Excluded,0.9514834
783,"An approach to the assessment of risk from chronic radiation to populations of European lobster, Homarus gammarus (L.) The basic principles underlying a four-discrete age group, logistic, growth model for the European lobster Homarus gammarus are presented and discussed at proof-of-concept level. The model considers reproduction, removal by predation, natural death, fishing, radiation and migration. Non-stochastic effects of chronic low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation are modelled with emphasis on (99)Tc, using three endpoints: repairable radiation damage, impairment of reproductive ability and, at higher dose rates, mortality. An allometric approach for the calculation of LD(50/30) as a function of the mass of each life stage is used in model calibration. The model predicts that at a dose rate of 1 Gy day(-1), lobster population reproduction and survival become severely compromised, leading eventually to population extinction. At 0.01 Gy day(-1), the survival rate of an isolated population is reduced by 10%, mainly through loss of fecundity, comparable to natural migration losses. Fishing is the main ecological stress and only dose rates in the range 0.03-0.1 Gy day(-1) can achieve discernible effects above it. On the balance of radiation and other ecological stresses, a benchmark value of 0.01 Gy day(-1) is proposed for the protection of lobster populations. This value appears consistent with available information on radiation effects in wildlife.",Excluded,0.9514512
651,"Chromosomal principle of radiation-induced F1 sterility in Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) A dose-response analysis of chromosomal aberrations was performed in male progeny of gamma-irradiated males in the flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella. For comparison, several female progeny from each dose level were examined. Aberrations were detected on microspread preparations of pachytene nuclei in the electron microscope and classified according to pairing configurations of synaptonemal complexes (SCs). Fragmentation and various translocations were the most numerous aberrations, whereas interstitial deletion and inversion were rare. At 100 Gy, relatively simple multiple translocations were found. Multiple translocations showing complicated configurations occurred at 150 and 200 Gy, and their number increased with the dose. In males, the mean number of chromosomal breaks resulting in aberrations linearly increased with the dose from 8.4 to 16.2 per nucleus. In females, this value achieved a maximum of 11.2 breaks/nucleus at 200 Gy. Three factors were suggested to contribute to the reported higher level of F1 sterility in males than females: (i) survival of males with high numbers of breaks, (ii) crossing-over in spermatogenesis but not in the achiasmatic oogenesis, and (iii) a higher impact of induced changes on the fertility of males than females. It was concluded that translocations are most responsible for the production of unbalanced gametes resulting in sterility of F1 moths. However, F1 sterility predicted according to the observed frequency of aberrations was much higher than the actual sterility reported earlier. This suggests a regulation factor which corrects the predicted unbalanced state towards balanced segregation of translocated chromosomes.",Excluded,0.9514154

The quantitative transmission of Litomosoides carinii to un-irradiated and irradiated golden hamsters and white mice The quantitative transmission of Litomosoides carinii by Liponyssus bacoti to un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters and mice is described. Both young and adult, un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters were highly susceptible to L. carinii but mice (un-irradiated or irradiated) were poor hosts. All hamsters (18 un-irradiated and seven irradiated) became infected. Seven out of nine mice in an un-irradiated series became infected. There was apparently 'age resistance' or 'young susceptibility' in the hamsters. The susceptibility of young hamsters appeared similar to that of new-born Carworth white rats and cotton rats. The pattern of infection in un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters was similar. Results from irradiated animals were insufficient to draw any clear conclusions on the effect of irradiation to susceptibility to infection with L. carinii. X-irradiation apparently did not affect the innate susceptibility cr resistance of hamsters and mice to worms. The duration and intensity of microfilaraemia was apparently higher in irradiated hamsters.",Excluded,0.9513953
258,"Deregulated levels of the NF-kappaB1, NF-kappaB2, and rel genes in ukrainian patients with leukemia and lymphoma in the post-chernobyl period Objective: Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is an important transcription factor in cancer and NF-kappaB activation has been seen in angiogenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis. Relationships between specific NF-kappaB gene networks, leukemogenesis, and radiation exposure are still unknown. Our aim was to study the expression levels of the NF-kappaB1, NF-kappaB2, and Rel genes in hematological malignancies in the post-Chernobyl period. Material(s) and Method(s): We analyzed gene expression levels of NFkappaB1, NF-kappaB2, and Rel in 49 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 8 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 3 acute myeloid leukemia, 3 chronic myeloid leukemia, 2 hairy cell leukemia, 2 myelodysplastic syndrome, and 2 T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia patients using realtime polymerase chain reaction. Result(s): Expression levels of NF-kappaB1, NF-kappaB2, and Rel genes were found to be deregulated. Conclusion(s): These results could be accepted as specific gene traces to radiation-induced leukemia or as potential candidates for new diagnostic biomarker studies. Larger experiments and non-exposed control malignant cell populations are needed to clarify these suggestions.Copyright © 2016, Turkish Society of Hematology. All right reserved.",Excluded,0.9513085
551,"Mortality Analysis of the Life Span Study (LSS) Cohort Taking into Account Multiple Causes of Death Indicated in Death Certificates Mortality analyses have been performed using underlying causes of death as reported on death certificates; these are uniquely determined for a deceased person according to the World Health Organization coding system. Comorbidities, the disease conditions other than the underlying cause of death from death certificates recording multiple causes of death, have rarely been explored in Life Span Study subjects. The purpose of this study was to clarify associations between atomic bomb radiation exposure and mortality from combinations of the underlying cause of death and comorbidities. The focused follow-up period was 1977-2003, prior to which death certificate accuracy was unreliable. The study cohort was comprised of 10,017 people for whom the category ""all circulatory disease"" was listed as the underlying cause of death, of which heart disease (rheumatic, hypertensive and ischemic heart disease) and stroke were major subtypes. Comorbidities considered were pneumonia, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer and the major circulatory disease subtypes listed above. Poisson regression models were used for analyses. Excess relative risks (ERRs) for mortality at 1 Gy were significantly increased when cancer was comorbid with all circulatory disease, heart disease, ischemic heart disease or stroke, ranging from 0.61 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.13, 1.41; N = 177 for all circulatory diseases to 1.60 (CI: 0.07, 4.86; N = 42) for ischemic heart disease. Among the other comorbidities, only diabetes comorbid with heart disease had a significant radiation dose response (ERR at 1 Gy of 0.62, CI: 0.10, 1.46; N = 128). It remains uncertain if the high ERRs with comorbid cancers were anomalous due to the small number of cases or some dissimilarity in statistical methodologies, or if this might suggest some pathogenetic basis for increased fatality. For this reason, further investigation is required.Copyright © 2017 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.95130223
717,"Evaluation of endogenous control gene(s) for gene expression studies in human blood exposed to 60Co gamma-rays ex vivo In gene expression studies, it is critical to normalize data using a stably expressed endogenous control gene in order to obtain accurate and reliable results. However, we currently do not have a universally applied endogenous control gene for normalization of data for gene expression studies, particularly those involving (60)Co gamma-ray-exposed human blood samples. In this study, a comparative assessment of the gene expression of six widely used housekeeping endogenous control genes, namely 18S, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, MT-ATP6 and CDKN1A, was undertaken for a range of (60)Co gamma-ray doses (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 Gy) at 8.4 Gy min(-1) at 0 and 24 h post-irradiation time intervals. Using the NormFinder algorithm, real-time PCR data obtained from six individuals (three males and three females) were analyzed with respect to the threshold cycle (Ct) value and abundance, DELTACt pair-wise comparison, intra- and inter-group variability assessments, etc. GAPDH, either alone or in combination with 18S, was found to be the most suitable endogenous control gene and should be used in gene expression studies, especially those involving qPCR of gamma-ray-exposed human blood samples.

825,"The development and biological characteristics of a novel potentially radioresistant inbred mouse strain The growth of biomedical research over the previous decades has been accompanied by an increase in the number, complexity and diversity of experimental animals developed as research tools, and inbred mice are some of the most widely used. However, thus far, no inbred mice have exhibited strong radioresistance for use in radiation-damage research. To develop a radioresistant mouse model, a female Japanese outbreeding strain ICR/JCL mouse was mated with a male Chinese inbred strain 615 mouse. From the F1 generation, the mouse line was maintained by brother-to-sister mating. A novel mouse strain was established over >20 continuous generations and designated the Institute of Radiation Medicine-2 (IRM-2) mouse. The biological characteristics, genetic characteristics and susceptibility to radiation of these mice were determined. The IRM-2 mice inherited traits from the parents, including strong reproductive capacity, stable physiological and biochemical indices and few differences among individuals. According to the genetic results, the IRM-2 mice exhibited homozygosity, isogenicity and consistency, in agreement with international standards for inbred strains. Radiosensitivity studies have previously suggested that the lethal dose (LD)50 values for IRM-2 mice were 7.17 Gy (male) and 7.5 Gy (female), resulting in a dose reduction factor value of 1.39 (male) and 1.37 (female). The mortality of IRM-2 mice irradiated with 8 Gy total body irradiation was 15% at day 9 and 90% at day 15 after radiation. The number of nucleated cells in bone marrow, DNA content and colony-forming unit-spleen counts in IRM-2 mice after exposure to gamma-ray irradiation were markedly higher than the corresponding values for the parental strains, suggesting that the IRM-2 mice exhibit high resistance to ionizing radiation. Thus, it is suggested that this novel inbred mouse strain may be developed as an animal model of radioresistance for future use in radiation research.",Excluded,0.95126075
660,"Site-specific cancer incidence and mortality after cerebral angiography with radioactive thorotrast Few opportunities exist to evaluate the carcinogenic effects of long-term internal exposure to alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides. Patients injected with Thorotrast (thorium-232) during radiographic procedures, beginning in the 1930s, provide one such valuable opportunity. We evaluated site-specific cancer incidence and mortality among an international cohort of 3,042 patients injected during cerebral angiography with either Thorotrast (n = 1,650) or a nonradioactive agent (n = 1,392) and who survived 2 or more years. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for Thorotrast and comparison patients (Denmark and Sweden) were estimated and relative risks (RR), adjusted for population, age and sex, were generated with multivariate statistical modeling. For U.S. patients, comparable procedures were used to estimate standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and RR, representing the first evaluation of long-term, site-specific cancer mortality in this group. Compared with nonexposed patients, significantly increased risks in Thorotrast patients were observed for all incident cancers combined (RR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.9-4.1, n = 480, Denmark and Sweden) and for cancer mortality (RR = 4.0, 95% CI 2.5-6.7, n = 114, U.S.). Approximately 335 incident cancers were above expectation, with large excesses seen for cancers of the liver, bile ducts and gallbladder (55% or 185 excess cancers) and leukemias other than CLL (8% or 26 excess cancers). The RR of all incident cancers increased with time since angiography (P < 0.001) and was threefold at 40 or more years; significant excesses (SIR = 4.0) persisted for 50 years. Increasing cumulative dose of radiation was associated with an increasing risk of all incident cancers taken together and with cancers of the liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum and other digestive sites; similar findings were observed for U.S. cancer mortality. A marginally significant dose response was observed for the incidence of pancreas cancer (P = 0.05) but not for lung cancer. Our study confirms the relationship between Thorotrast and increased cancer incidence at sites of Thorotrast deposition and suggests a possible association with pancreas cancer. After injection with >20 ml Thorotrast, the cumulative excess risk of cancer incidence remained elevated for up to 50 years and approached 97%. Caution is needed in interpreting the excess risks observed for site-specific cancers, however, because of the potential bias associated with the selection of cohort participants, noncomparability with respect to the internal or external comparison groups, and confounding by indication. Nonetheless, the substantial risks associated with liver cancer and leukemia indicate that unique and prolonged exposure to alpha-particle-emitting Thorotrast increased carcinogenic risks.",Excluded,0.9512412

All the patients examined were maintained within 4 weeks on a diet, radioprotective effect of which was realized due to the elevated content of sulfur containing amino acids, antioxidants and complexes. In the patients who lived in the radionuclide-contaminated areas, a moderate activation of lipid peroxidation was detected simultaneously with marked alterations in the humoral component of the immunity system, which involved a considerable increase in the levels of IgG and complements C3 and C4. A decrease in content of malonic dialdehyde and diene conjugates as well as normalization of IgG and decrease in content of IgA, IgM and C3 were observed in blood plasma of the patients on diet. Supplementation of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega 3-PUFA), 5 g/day and alpha-tocopherol, 12.5 mg/day, to the diet elevated the serum concentrations of all lg classes, which suggests the presence of an immunomodulating effect of omega 3-PUFA. Moreover, the content of malonic dialdehyde was not increased in blood plasma if 3-PUFA was used. Hence, increased alpha-tocopherol levels should be used in the treatment of these patients with omega 3-PUFA (up to 5-7 mg per g PUFA) in order to stabilize lipid peroxidation.",Excluded,0.9512127

1132,"Impact of chemical exposure on cancer mortality in a French cohort of uranium processing workers Background: Nuclear workers may be exposed to a variety of chemical hazards, in addition to radiation. We examined the effect of chemical exposures on cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers at the AREVA NC Pierrelatte facility. Method(s): A cohort of 2,897 uranium processing workers employed for at least 6 months was followed from 1968 through 2006. Exposure to uranium and potentially carcinogenic chemicals was assessed with a plant-specific job-exposure matrix. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for cancers of the lung, lymphohematopoietic system, kidney and bladder, brain and central nervous system (BCNS), and prostate were estimated for each specific chemical exposure, with Cox regression models stratified for sex and calendar period and adjusted for socioeconomic status. Additional adjustments enabled us to examine the effect of co-exposure to uranium and other chemicals. Result(s): Exposure to aromatic solvents was associated with increased risk of BCNS malignancies after adjustment for other chemicals (HR=6.53, 95% CI=1.14-37.41; n=6) and for other chemicals and uranium (HR=7.26, 95% CI=0.90-58.19) in the annual exposure status model. Selected groups of lymphohematopoietic cancers were found associated with solvent exposure. Inconclusive results were found regarding chromium (VI) exposure, since only 2 workers died from lung cancer among 109 exposed. Conclusion(s): Based on our pilot study, it seemed important to take into account chemical exposures in the analyses of cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers. Am. J. Ind.

Our in vivo study measured miRNA and gene expression changes in human blood cells in response to ionizing radiation, to develop miRNA signatures that can be used as biomarkers for radiation exposure. Methods and Materials: Blood from 8 radiotherapy patients in complete remission 1 or 2 was collected immediately before and 4 hours after total body irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays. Both miRNA and gene expression changes were measured by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction and microarray hybridization, respectively. Hierarchic clustering, multidimensional scaling, class prediction, and gene ontology analysis were performed to investigate the potential of miRNAs to serve as radiation biomarkers and to elucidate their likely physiologic roles in the radiation response. Result(s): The expression levels of 45 miRNAs were statistically significantly upregulated 4 hours after irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays, 27 of them in every patient. Nonirradiated and irradiated samples form separate clusters in hierarchic clustering and multidimensional scaling. Out of 223 differentially expressed genes, 37 were both downregulated and predicted targets of the upregulated miRNAs. Paired and unpaired miRNA-based classifiers that we developed can predict the class membership of a sample with unknown irradiation status, with accuracies of 100% when all 45 upregulated miRNAs are included. Both miRNA control of and gene involvement in biologic processes such as hemopoiesis and the immune response are increased after irradiation, whereas metabolic processes are underrepresented among all differentially expressed genes and the genes controlled by miRNAs. Conclusion(s): Exposure to ionizing radiation leads to the upregulation of the expression of a considerable proportion of the human miRNAome of peripheral blood cells. These miRNA expression signatures can be used as biomarkers of radiation exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.9510514

A subset was imaged prospectively using a high-resolution Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography., RESULTS: Among 94 eyes treated, 33 eyes (32 subjects) had >= 2-year follow-up information (mean follow-up, 6.2 years; range, 2-10 years). Final visual acuity ranged from 20/50 to no light perception. Final macular findings included central geographic atrophy (49%), disciform scar (30%), and active choroidal neovascular membrane (9%). Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography images of three eyes with geographic atrophy revealed photoreceptor layer loss within areas of geographic atrophy with intact retinal morphology in areas of radiation exposure outside geographic atrophy. Radiation retinopathy was suspected in 18% and confirmed by fluorescein angiography in 15%, ranging from mild to neovascular glaucoma/phthisis bulbi (2 eyes). Mean time from stereotactic fractionated external beam radiation to development of radiation retinopathy was 5.4 years (range, 1-10 years)., CONCLUSION: A moderate rate of delayed radiation retinopathy was noted in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration treated with stereotactic fractionated external beam radiation.

805,"Impact of radiotherapy dose on dentition breakdown in head and neck cancer patients Purpose: To evaluate the severity of post-radiation dental lesions and possible correlation with radiation dose to the teeth in patients treated for head and neck cancers. Methods and Materials: Data from 93 head and neck radiotherapy patients treated between 1997 and 2008 were analyzed retrospectively. The main effect, radiation dose to the individual teeth, was evaluated with covariates of elapsed time after radiation, xerostomia, topical fluoride use, and oral hygiene status included. Patients' radiotherapy plans were used to calculate cumulative exposure for each tooth. Patients' teeth were evaluated using a validated index and then categorized as having none-slight or moderate-severe post-radiation damage. Result(s): Patients (31 females, 62 males) ranged in age from 18-82 years (mean 57). The number of teeth-patient ranged from 3-30 (mean 20) with a total of 1873 teeth evaluated. Overall, 51% of teeth had moderate-severe damage, with the remaining having little or none. Using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, the odds for moderate-severe damage were 2-3 times greater for teeth exposed to between 30 and 60 Gy as compared to no radiation. However, for teeth exposed to >= 60 Gy as compared to no radiation the odds of moderate-severe tooth damage was greater by a magnitude of 10 times. Conclusion(s): The results indicate that there is minimal tooth damage below 30 Gy (salivary gland threshold), a greater than 1:1 increased dose-response between 30 and 60 Gy likely related to salivary gland damage, and a critical threshold of >= 60 Gy, which may be linked to direct effects of radiation on tooth structure.

However, the current knowledge on the mutation spectra is limited, and the effects of radiation exposure on germ cells at stages other than the sperm stage remain unknown. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing experiments to investigate the exposure of spermatogonia and mature oocytes.

Results did not seem to correlate with known vascular disease risk factors such as sex, arterial pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking and diabetes. After the effect of age was controlled, flow measurements remained statistically stable. Radiation dosage did not appear to influence carotid flow parameters. Perivascular reaction had the highest peak immediately postirradiation but regressed with time.

The radiobiological response of the mammary glands renders it possible to prevent hormone induced gynecomastia by means of radiotherapy. On this indication, 121 patients treated with female sex hormones between 1961 and 1972 for carcinoma of the prostate were subjected to irradiation of both mammary glands. On 4 successive days, daily doses of 300 r surface dose were administered to each mammary gland, corresponding to a focal dose of 840 r at 3 cm tissue depth. The parameters were: roentgen radiation, 150 kV, 20 mA, 0.5 mm Cu, focus skin distance 40 cm, field size 6 x 6 m. 84 patients could be followed up more than 6 mth after the treatment. In 67 cases (79.8%), development of gynecomastia was completely suppressed, while in 16 cases, a slight degree of gynecomastia had occurred in spite of the irradiation. In one case, the gynecomastia that had already been completely developed at the time of the radiotherapy, had remained uninfluenced apart from a mitigation of the sensation of tension. In 6 of the patients who were free from gynecomastia (8.9%) the hormone treatment had been started prior to the radiotherapy. This proportion was considerably larger among the patients with mild gynecomastia, viz. 75% (12 cases). The lesser effect of the radiotherapy is considered to be correlated with the duration and dosage of the hormone treatment started prior to the radiotherapy, and may also be correlated with the duration of the interval between the end of the hormone treatment and the start of the irradiation.",Excluded,0.95070225

The average length of follow-up was 36.6 yr. There were 36 confirmed cases of hyperparathyroidism. Based on a relative risk model, the excess relative risk increased significantly by 0.11/centigray; however, the confidence interval was wide (95% confidence interval, 0.0-17.2). The hyperparathyroidism rates and dose-response relationships were not affected by gender or age at first radiation treatment.

Two functions, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD and I = (C + beta D2)e-gammaD, fit the data for year of entry (p greater than or equal to 0.05); both these functions and I = (C + alpha D) fit the data for first measurement.

795,"Biological dosimetry after yttrium-90 citrate colloid radiosynoviorthesis UNLABELLED: Radiosynoviorthesis (RSO) with the ss-particle-emitting nuclide yttrium-90 is an established concept for the treatment of persistent synovitis of the knee joint. The AIM of this study was to investigate the biological radiation effect on the basis of a characteristic radiation parameter., PATIENTS, METHODS: After RSO procedures with yttrium-90 citrate colloid and subsequent immobilisation of the knee, blood specimens of 10 patients were collected immediately before RSO and 11 to 13 days after the intervention. The yield of dicentric chromosomes in the lymphocytes was determined exclusively in metaphases of the first cell cycle in vitro. In addition, activity leakage was measured by wholebody bremsstrahlung-scintigraphy., RESULTS: No statistically significant increase in the number of dicentric chromosomes (26 before treatment and 34 after treatment) in 20 192 cells analyzed from the 20 blood samples could be found as a result of RSO. However, the analysis of at least 1000 cells per blood sample demonstrates a tendency for a biological radiation effect in the blood of patients on the basis of this characteristic radiation parameter. Two of the 10 RSO patients had undergone a second RSO using yttrium-90 citrate, whereby one patient displayed activity transport out of the knee joint, amounting to 6 MBq. Only for him a radiation effect (about 130 mGy per single RSO) could be calculated by biological dosimetry., CONCLUSION: Since in general, based on the analysis of dicentric chromosomes in at least 1000 lymphocytes per individual, detection limits for groups of persons after long-term exposures to low-LET radiation of 50-100 mGy are possible, we assume that RSO with yttrium-90 should be associated with a low whole-body radiation exposure.",Excluded,0.950425
525,"Impaired permeability in radiation-induced lung injury detected by technetium-99m-DTPA lung clearance UNLABELLED: This study evaluates the use of the 99mTc-DTPA aerosol lung clearance method to investigate radiation-induced lung changes in eight patients undergoing radiotherapy for lung or breast carcinoma. The sensitivity of the method was compared with chest radiography for detecting radiation-induced changes in the lung, regional alterations within (irradiated region) and outside (shielded region) the treatment ports, effect of irradiated lung volume, and dependence on time after radiotherapy., METHODS: Serial DTPA lung clearance studies were performed before the first radiation treatment (baseline), then weekly during a 5- to 7-wk course, and up to 12 times post-therapy over periods of 56-574 days. The total activity deposited in the lungs for each study was approximately 150 microCi (approximately 5.6 MBq). DTPA clearance, expressed in terms of the biological half-time, t 1/2, was computed from the slopes of the least-squares fit regression lines of the time-activity curves for the first 10 min for irradiated and shielded lung regions., RESULTS: Major findings include: (a) significant and early DTPA t 1/2 changes were observed in all patients during and after radiotherapy; (b) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in both irradiated and shielded lung regions in all patients suggesting a radiation-induced systemic reaction; (c) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were correlated (p < 0.05) with the irradiated lung volumes; (d) significantly reduced DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in three patients who subsequently presented with clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes consistent with radiation pneumonitis (t1/2 felt to 19% +/- 6% of baseline values, compared with 64% +/- 17% in the remaining patients [p < 0.01]); (e) the onset of decreased DTPA t 1/2 values in these three patients occurred 35-84 days before clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes; and (f) DTPA t 1/2 tended to approach baseline values with time after radiotherapy, suggesting a long-term recovery in lung injury., CONCLUSION: These observations show significant and early alterations in DTPA lung clearance during and after radiotherapy that may provide a sensitive assay to monitor changes in radiation-induced lung injury and may facilitate early therapeutic intervention.",Excluded,0.9503962

474,"A sentinel case series of cancer patients with occupational exposures to electromagnetic non-ionizing radiation and other agents Background. There are reports that intense prolonged occupational exposure to non-ionizing radiation may increase risks for cancer. We previously have reported a sentinel cluster, of 7 workers with high exposures and short latent periods, and individual patients with brain cancer high occupational exposures and short latent periods. We present a sentinel case series (n=47, 40M, 7F) of cancer patients, referred to our medical unit with occupational exposures to non-ionizing radiation of all types. Objectives. Our aims were to report the findings on tumour types, age of first diagnosis, and latency, to describe their exposures and to examine the hypothesis that latencies for all tumour types (solid tissue, hematolymphatic, testicular) were coherently related to high occupational exposures starting at young ages. Methods. We divided the patients into groups by latency. We categorized each patient's exposures in regard to types of radiation, far or near field exposure and direct body contact. For some we had data on frequencies, for others we provided assessments. We also present the patient data categorized by age of diagnosis.We used a case-case type comparison to examine latencies for tumour types [solid, hematolymphatic (HL), testicular]. Results. 15 patients developed cancer with latent periods of less than 5 years and 12 patients with latent periods between 5 and 10 years. The remaining 20 patients had longer latent periods between first occupational exposure to EMF and diagnosis of cancer. 6 patients (12.7%) had multiple tumours. 12 patients (25.5%) reported cancer cases in co-workers. In the <5 years latency group there were 8 hematolymphatic cancers, 3 testicular cancers and 6 solid tumours [head & neck (including brain) and GI tract]. In all latency groups there were patients who were exposed to intense levels of electromagnetic fields (EMF), to several types of EMF, or to EMF in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) or other exposures, and patients who had direct body contact with the equipment, were in direct focus of high radiation, or worked in small, electronically dense environments. Case classification by age showed shorter latencies with younger ages, but this association is complicated by the fact that shorter latencies co-vary with younger ages especially for testicular tumours. But patients with testicular and hematolymphatic tumours had shorter latencies than those with solid tumours. Conclusion. Many of the patients were young and had extremely short latent periods, especially for HL and testicular cancers. The fact that latent periods for testes were very short, HL longer and solid still longer suggests a coherent and biologically plausible pattern of latency in relation to the onset of exposure to EMF and other agents. The findings strengthen the hypothesis that these exposures may possibly be the major cause of many of these tumours. The findings state the case for (1) better modelling of exposure sources and penetration into the body and (2) preventive and protective measures based on control of exposure at source, barriers, and personal protection.",Excluded,0.9502684
913,"Radiation Exposure to solar and ionizing radiation increases the risk for cancer in humans. Some 5% of solar radiation is within the ultraviolet spectrum and may cause both malignant melanoma and non-melanocytic skin cancer; the latter is regarded as a benign disease and is accordingly not included in our estimation of avoidable cancers. Under the assumption that the rate of occurrence of malignant melanoma of the buttocks of both men and women and of the scalp of women would apply to all parts of the body in people completely unexposed to solar radiation, it was estimated that approximately 95% of all malignant melanomas arising in the Nordic populations around the year 2000 will be due to exposure to natural ultraviolet radiation, equivalent to an annual number of about 4700 cases, with 2100 in men and 2600 in women, or some 4% of all cancers notified. Exposure to ionizing radiation in the Nordic countries occurs at an average effective dose per capita per year of about 3 mSv (Iceland, 1.1 mSv) from natural sources, and about 1 mSv from man-made sources. While the natural sources are primarily radon in indoor air, natural radionuclides in food, cosmic radiation and gamma radiation from soil and building materials, the man-made sources are dominated by the diagnostic and therapeutic use of ionizing radiation. On the basis of measured levels of radon in Nordic dwellings and associated risk estimates for lung cancer derived from well-conducted epidemiological studies, we estimated that about 180 cases of lung cancer (1% of all lung cancer cases) per year could be avoided in the Nordic countries around the year 2000 if indoor exposure to radon were eliminated, and that an additional 720 cases (6%) could be avoided annually if either radon or tobacco smoking were eliminated. Similarly, it was estimated that the exposure of the Nordic populations to natural sources of ionizing radiation other than radon and to medical sources will each give rise to an annual total of 2120 cancers at various sites. For all types of ionizing radiation, the annual total will be 4420 cancer cases, or 3.9% of all cancers arising in the Nordic populations, with 3.4% in men and 4.4% in women.",Excluded,0.9502163
1139,"Statistical analysis of observational study of the influence of radon and other risk factors on lung cancer incidence An observational study is a type of epidemiological study when the researcher observes the situation but is not able to change the conditions of the experiment. The statistical analysis of the observational study of the population of Lermontov city (North Caucasus) was conducted. In the initial group, there were 121 people with lung cancer diagnosis and 196 people of the control group. Statistical analysis was performed only for men (95 cases and 76 controls). The use of logistic regression with correction on age gives the value of odds ratio 1.95 (0.87/4.37; 90% CI) per 100 working levels per month of combined (occupational and domestic) radon exposure. It was demonstrated that chronic lung diseases are an additional risk factor for uranium miners but it is not a significant risk factor for general population. Thus, the possibility of obtaining statistically reliable results in the observational studies when using the correct methods of analysis is demonstrated.Copyright © The Author 2014.

180,"Lung exposure from inhalation of radon progeny: Calculated from in vivo measurements of 210Pb in the skull To calculate the radiation dose to the lungs from the inhalation of radon and its short-lived progeny, an accurate estimate of cumulative exposure is necessary. In this preliminary study, the content of 210Pb in the skeleton is used to obtain a measure of integrated exposure to the lungs of people living in homes with above average concentrations of radon. Measurements of skeletal 210Pb made in vivo allow the exposed individuals to become, in effect, their own 'samplers' and 'dosimeters' through the normal physical and physiological processes of inhalation, deposition, and retention. 210Pb measurements have been made on 40 subjects whose homes have above average levels of radon. These data are used to obtain their cumulative lung exposures, defined as RLM (Respiratory Level Months). RLM is calculated from the numbers of atoms of RaA, RaB, and RaC,C' deposited in their respiratory systems over the time periods lived in the surveyed homes.

Workers at the MPA were exposed to relatively large internal radiation intakes and external radiation exposures, particularly in the early years of plant operations. This paper describes the updated dosimetry database, ""Doses-2005."" Doses-2005 represents a significant improvement in the determination of absorbed organ dose from external radiation and plutonium intake for the original cohort of 18,831 Mayak workers. The methods of dose reconstruction of absorbed organ doses from external radiation uses: 1) archive records of measured dose and worker exposure history, 2) measured energy and directional response characteristics of historical Mayak film dosimeters, and 3) calculated dose conversion factors for Mayak Study-defined exposure scenarios using Monte Carlo techniques. The methods of dose reconstruction for plutonium intake uses two revised models developed from empirical data derived from bioassay and autopsy cases and/or updates from prevailing or emerging International Commission on Radiological Protection models. Other sources of potential significant exposure to workers such as medical diagnostic x-rays, ambient onsite external radiation, neutron radiation, intake of airborne effluent, and intake of nuclides other than plutonium were evaluated to determine their impact on the dose estimates.",Excluded,0.9498495

An experimental autoallergic sialadenitis (EAS) of the rat submandibular gland was developed to serve as the standard lesion. Consistently mild or severe lesions of EAS were induced in male Lewis rats when they were immunized with allogeneic submandibular glands from sexually immature or mature female donors, respectively. Neck irradiation alone 7-56 days prior to sacrifice induced only occasional inflammatory lesions in the submandibular glands. The weights of the submandibular glands were seen to decrease progressively while the body weights continued to rise. Neck irradiation 7-56 days prior to sacrifice of animals immunized 7-21 days prior to sacrifice to induce mild or severe EAS did not significantly accelerate development of the lesion nor w,as the intensity of inflammatory lesions significantly modified. In nanimals with mild or severe EAS which were neck irradiated, the weights of the submandibular glands were found to decrease while the body weight remained relatively unchanged.

In the context of the sterile insect technique (SIT), the sterilization of the male mosquitoes before their release can be achieved by gamma-ray irradiation. As gamma-ray irradiators are becoming increasingly problematic to purchase and transport, the suitability of an X-ray irradiator as an alternative for the sterilization of Ae. albopictus males was studied. The sterilization of up to 200,000 pupae at one time can be achieved with relative ease, and the sterility results obtained were comparable with those achieved by gamma irradiation, where 99% sterility is induced with a dose of 40 Gy. A significant reduction of longevity was observed in the latter stages of the males' life after irradiation treatments, especially at doses > 40 Gy, which is consistent with the negative effects on longevity induced by similar radiation doses using gamma rays. Females irradiated at 40 Gy were not only 100% sterile, but also failed to oviposit entirely, i.e., all of the females laid 0 eggs. Overall, it was found that the X-ray irradiator is generally suitable for the sterilization process for sterile insect technique programs, as it showed a high processing capacity, practicality, high effectiveness, and reproducibility.",Excluded,0.9497844

An attempt is now made to quantify the impact of random error in the exposure assessment on the risk estimate for lung cancer in this study. The study included 1,360 lung cancer cases, diagnosed from 1980 to 1984, and 2,847 population controls. Radon measurements were performed in 8,992 dwellings occupied by the study subjects some time since 1947. Questionnaires provided information on smoking and other risk factors. Imprecision in the retrospective exposure assessment for radon was estimated from a Monte Carlo technique modeling Swedish conditions. Adjusted risk estimates were obtained from regression analyses based on expected values for true time-weighted average residential radon concentration (TWA), conditional on observed TWA. Without adjustment for random error in the TWA estimates, the linear excess relative risk coefficient was 0.10 per 100 Bq m(-3), but an excess relative risk of about 0.15 to 0.20 per 100 Bq m(-3) was suggested following adjustment.

V: limitations of repair following damage to the hematopoietic support stroma Damage and repair of the hematopoietic microenvironment of the spleen was studied using X-irradiation, anoxic necrosis induced by splenic ligation, or a combination of the two, as the destructive agents. Spleen colony number, size and type, 59Fe uptake, and microscopic study of splenic structure were used as means of assessment. The most severe or least repaired damage was induced by high dose irradiation (4000 r), by 1000 r followed immediately by splenic ligation, and by two successive splenic ligations separated by a 30 day recovery period. It was seen that reduction of CFUs lodgment, as measured by f factor, played a very major role in the lesser number of spleen colonies formed after either kind of damage. Following the several treatments, the numbers of spleen colonies formed, their size and their typing as erythrocytic or granulocytic varied independently of each other, suggesting that these functions of the microenvironment, and the cell types responsible for them, are independent of each other.

64,"Assessment of effect of partial sterility on mating performance in sweetpotato weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) The sterile insect technique (SIT) is widely used to suppress or eradicate target pest insect populations. Although the effectiveness of SIT depends on the ability of released sterile males to mate with and inseminate wild females, the use of gamma radiation to induce sterility negatively impacts reproductive cells as well as somatic cells. Consequently, sterilization by irradiation drastically diminishes mating performance over time. In the current study, we evaluated the effect of irradiation dose intensity on fertility, mating propensity, and mating competitiveness in sweetpotato weevil, Cylas formicarius elegantulus (Summers) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), for 16 d after irradiation. Although the mating propensity of males irradiated with 200 Gy, the dose currently used to induce complete sterility of C. f. elegantulus in the SIT program in Okinawa Prefecture, was equal to that of nonirradiated weevils for the first 6 d, the mating propensity of males irradiated with doses between of 75 and 150 Gy was maintained for the first 12 d. The potential fertilization ability of weevils was highly depressed compared with the control weevils, even in those treated with 75 Gy. Mating performance was severely compromised in weevils that were irradiated with a dose of 100 Gy or more. These results demonstrate that partial sterilization can be highly advantageous in eradication programs for the sweetpotato weevil.

Materials and Methods Nine large U.S. medical institutions identified 208 former and current nuclear medicine technologists certified after 1979 and linked these individuals to historic badge dose records maintained by a commercial dosimetry company (Landauer), yielding a total of 2618 annual dose records. The distributions of annual and cumulative occupational doses were described by using summary statistics. Results Between 1992 and 2015, the median annual personal dose equivalent per nuclear medicine technologist was 2.18 mSv (interquartile range [IQR], 1.25-3.47 mSv; mean, 2.69 mSv). Median annual personal dose equivalents remained relatively constant over this period (range, 1.40-3.30 mSv), while maximum values generally increased over time (from 8.00 mSv in 1992 to 13.9 mSv in 2015). The median cumulative personal dose equivalent was 32.9 mSv (IQR, 18.1-65.5 mSv; mean, 51.4 mSv) for 45 technologists who had complete information and remained employed through 2015. Conclusion Occupational radiation doses were well below the established occupational limits and were consistent with those observed for nuclear medicine technologists worldwide and were greater than those observed for nuclear and general medical workers in the United States These results should be informative for radiation monitoring and safety efforts in nuclear medicine departments. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",Excluded,0.94937295

In head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, long-term treatment-related complications include radiotherapy (RT)-induced carotid vasculopathy and stroke. The current study investigated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of the carotid wall in long-term HNC survivors treated with RT.Methods. MRI of the carotid arteries was performed within a prospective cohort of 42 HNC patients on average 7 years after RT. Two independent radiologists assessed maximal vessel wall thickness of common and internal carotid arteries. In case of wall thickening (>= 2 mm) the MRI signals as well as length of the thickened segment were assessed.Results. Mean (SD) age of the 42 patients at baseline was 53 (13) years and mean (SD) follow-up time after RT was 6.8 (1.3) years. In total 62% were men and 60% had one or more cerebrovascular risk factors. Mean (SD) dose of RT on the common carotid arteries and internal carotid arteries was 57 Gy (11) and 61 Gy (10), respectively. Wall thickening was observed in 58% of irradiated versus 27% of non-irradiated common carotid arteries and 24% of irradiated versus 6% of non-irradiated internal carotid arteries (p < 0.05). Mean (SD) thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated common carotid arteries was 2.5 (0.9) and 2 (0.7) mm (p = 0.02). Mean thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated internal carotid arteries was 1.8 (0.8) and 1.5 mm (0.3) (n.s.). Mean length of the thickened vessel wall was 48 mm versus 36 mm in the irradiated versus non-irradiated common carotid arteries (p = 0.03) and 20 mm versus 15 mm in the irradiated versus non-irradiated internal carotid arteries (n.s.). No significant differences were observed for signal intensities of the vessel walls.Conclusions.

We hypothesized that LC3B could play a role in the regulation of thyroid cancer cells response to radiation. Expression of LC3B was examined by real-time PCR and Western blot in FTC133, FTC236 and FTC238 cells. Stable LC3B-deficient cells were created by transfection with lentiviral particles containing LC3B specific shRNA. Thyroid cancer cell viability, proliferation, migration and apoptosis were analyzed in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells after exposure to gamma-radiation (6 Gy). Immunostaining with anti-LC3B was performed on tissue samples from 10 patients with anaplastic (ATCs) and 10 patients with papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs). LC3B expression was decreased in cell lines that derived from metastatic lesions (by 70% in FTC236 and by 90% in FTC238) as compared to FTC133 cells. Transfection with lentiviral particles inhibited LC3B mRNA level by 80% in FTC133 cells. LC3B silencing had no effect on cell cycle, did not inhibit thyroid cancer cells migration, and did not induce apoptosis. Glucose deprivation led to phosphorylation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells. Induction of LC3BII and loss of p62 protein were detected in LC3B-expressing but not in LC3B-deficient cells. gamma-radiation induced gH2AX and caspase 3 cleavage in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells. However, recovery of thyroid cancer cells after irradiation was more efficient in LC3B-deficient cells. Colony forming assay showed that survival fraction after gamma-radiation was higher in LC3B-deficient cells compared to LC3B-expressing cells (p = 0.01). Granular cytoplasmic staining with anti-LC3B was detected in 5/10 (50%) differentiated PTCs, but in 0/10 (0%) ATCs. LC3B is involved in thyroid cancer cell resistance to metabolic and oxidative stressors. Decreased LC3B expression in undifferentiated thyroid cancer suggests that defective autophagy can contribute to thyroid cancer cell resistance to therapy.",Excluded,0.9492593

An ecological study from an area with high indoor radon concentration (Galicia, Spain) PURPOSE: To analyze the correlation between municipal esophageal cancer relative risk and municipal residential radon concentration in a high radon emission Spanish area., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an ecological study at municipal level in Galicia, Spain. For each municipality we estimated the median radon concentration and the relative risk (RR) for esophageal cancer mortality for males and females. The relative risk was calculated using a Bayesian approach. Homes with data on radon concentration were selected through stratified random sampling. To be included, each municipality had to have at least five radon measurements. We obtained Spearman's correlations for median residential radon concentration and esophageal cancer mortality RR for males and females, separately., RESULTS: We included 129 municipalities, covering the 79% of Galician population. 14% of municipalities had radon concentrations above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) action level. We found a statistically significant correlation among residential radon and esophageal cancer mortality RR for males (p < 0.001), but not for females. When the analysis was restricted to municipalities with more than 15 radon measurements the correlation pattern remained., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study analyzing the association between residential radon and esophageal cancer.

This study presents a novel minimally invasive protocol for molecular study of fibrosis in the stromal tissues., METHODS: Subjects with radiation-induced fibrosis in the head and neck who were at least 6 months post treatment received submental core needle biopsies, followed by molecular processing and quantification of gene expression for 14 select pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes. Control biopsies from the upper arm were obtained from the same subjects. Patients were followed up at 1 and 2 weeks to monitor for safety and adverse outcomes., RESULTS: Six subjects were enrolled and completed the study. No subjects experienced adverse outcomes or complication. An 18 gauge core biopsy needle with a 10 mm notch inserted for up to 60 seconds was needed. Subcutaneous tissue yielded 3 ng of RNA, amplified to 6 microg of cDNA, allowing for adequately sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of approximately 28 genes., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the safety and utility of a novel technique for the molecular study of fibrosis in head and neck cancer patients.

Materials/Methods: This study was consisted of 2 phases. In the primary phase, mice treated with helical tomotherapy based SBRT were stratified according to escalating radiation doses to the livers. Pathological differences, signs, such as mouse performance status (MPS), and serum aspartate/ alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT)/albumin levels were observed. Radiation-induced disease severities of OARs were scored using systematic evaluation standards. In the validation phase in human, 13 patients with HCC who had undergone radiation therapy before hepatectomy were enrolled to validate RILD pathological changes in mice study. Result(s): Evaluation criteria of mouse liver radiation therapy relating signs were as follows: MPS >=2.0+/-0.52, AST/ALT >=589.2+/-118.5/137.4+/-15.3 U/L, serum albumin <=16.8+/-2.29 g/L. Preliminary dose constraints of OARs had also been obtained, such as livers: average dose <=26.36+/-1.71 Gy and gastrointestinal tract: maximum dose <=22.63 Gy. Mouse RILD models could be developed when livers were irradiated with the average doses >=31.76+/-1.94 Gy (single fraction). RILD pathological changes in mice had also been validated in HCC patients. Conclusion(s): Mouse RILD models could be developed with SBRT based on the dose constraints for OARs and evaluation criteria of mice liver radiation therapy relating signs, which will favor the study of further approaches of treating HCC with SBRT.",Excluded,0.9486519
503,"Seven cases of radiation-induced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma We report 7 cases of radiation-induced skin cancer. The diagnosis was based on the history of radiotherapy for benign skin diseases (5 cases) and of occupational exposures to medical doctors (2 cases). All cases were squamous cell carcinomas which arose from chronic radiodermatitis. The estimated latent period of these tumors ranged from 6 to 64 years, with an average of 29.9 years. After surgical treatments of the lesions, no local recurrences were observed in all cases. Benign skin diseases had sometimes been treated with low-energy radiation before the 1960s. Considering the estimated latent period, the peak time point of developing risk of radiation-induced skin cancer by such treatment has been already passed, however, the danger of it should not be ignored in future. In association with multiplicity of radiation usage, occupational exposure of radiation may develop the risk of occurrence of skin cancer in future. Therefore, we should recognize that radiation-induced skin cancer is not in the past. In the cases of chronic skin diseases showing warty keratotic growth, erosion and ulcer, we should include chronic radio-dermatitis in the differential diagnosis. It is necessary to recall all patients about the history of radiotherapy or radiation exposure. Rapid histopathological examination is mandatory because of the suspicion of radiation-induced skin cancer.",Excluded,0.9485782
445,"Residential randon exposure and lung cancer risk in Misasa, Japan: a case-control study In order to investigate an association between residential radon exposure and risk of lung cancer, a case-control study was conducted in Misasa Town, Tottori Prefecture, Japan. The case series consisted of 28 people who had died of lung cancer in the years 1976-96 and 36 controls chosen randomly from the residents in 1976, matched by sex and year of birth. Individual residential radon concentrations were measured for 1 year with alpha track detectors. The average radon concentration was 46 Bq/m3 for cases and 51 Bq/m3 for controls. Compared to the level of 24 or less Bq/m3, the adjusted odds ratios of lung cancer associated with radon levels of 25-49, 50-99 and 100 or more Bq/m3, were 1.13 (95% confidence interval; 0.29-4.40), 1.23 (0.16-9.39) and 0.25 (0.03-2.33), respectively. None of the estimates showed statistical significance, due to small sample size. When the subjects were limited to only include residents of more than 30 years, the estimates did not change substantially. This study did not find that the risk pattern of lung cancer, possibly associated with residential radon exposure, in Misasa Town differed from patterns observed in other countries.",Excluded,0.94777083
248,"Long-term results of radiation therapy for pituitary adenoma Purpose. Local control for pituitary adenomas treated with external beam radiation therapy was retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of radiation. Materials and methods. Thirty-eight patients treated with radiation therapy between 1979 and 1994 were analyzed. The median age was 46. Nineteen newly diagnosed tumors were treated with surgery and radiation therapy, while the others were recurrent cases. Twenty-two tumors were non-functioning, while 10 produced growth hormone (GH) and three each were prolactin-, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing tumors. The median radiation dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Results. Non-functioning adenomas and prolactin-producing adenomas were completely controlled, judging from the absence of tumor progression on neuroimaging studies and clinical symptoms, and normalization of the serum prolactin level (< 25 ng/ml). On the other hand, local control was obtained in only one of the 3 patients with ACTH-producing adenomas, and the control rate at 10 years was only 46% for GH-producing adenomas. Panhypopituitarism developed in 35% of the patients after radiation therapy. No other serious complications were noted. Conclusion. Non-functioning pituitary adenomas and prolactin-producing adenomas were well controlled with external radiation therapy combined with surgery. However, dose escalation might be necessary to control GH- or ACTH-producing tumors. It is important to replace corticosteroid hormone and thyroid hormone in many patients.",Excluded,0.9474417

304,"Influence of previous radiation exposure on pathologic features and clinical outcome in patients with thyroid cancer Objective: To determine whether previous radiation exposure to the head and neck is related to less favorable pathologic and clinical outcome in patients after surgical management of thyroid cancer. Design(s): Retrospective chart review. Setting(s): Academic teaching hospital (referral center). Patient(s): All patients with diagnosed thyroid cancer who had been exposed to radiation before surgical treatment were retrospectively identified from the thyroid cancer database at our institution (1963-2007). One hundred twenty-five patients (95 women and 30 men) were included. Inclusion criteria included surgical treatment for thyroid cancer and a history of exposure to radiation at least 3 years before diagnosis of the disease. Main Outcome Measure(s): Pathologic features and data related to disease recurrence, distant metastasis, and survival. Result(s): Mean (range) age at first exposure to radiation was 19.4 (1-65) years, and mean lag time to diagnosis of disease was 28.7 (3-60) years. Patients were treated surgically with either total or near-total thyroidectomy (83%) or partial or subtotal thyroidectomy (17%). Pathologic diagnoses included 111 papillary carcinomas (89%). Sixty- three percent of patients had multifocal disease, 12% had lymphovascular tumor invasion, and 26% had direct ex- trathyroid extension of disease. Twenty-five percent of patients had metastases to cervical lymph nodes, and 9% had distant metastases. Sixteen percent of patients experienced local recurrence of disease. At last follow-up, 86% of patients were alive and free of disease, 8% were alive with disease, 4% had died of thyroid cancer, and 2% had died of an unrelated cause. Compared with other patients with thyroid cancer, this radiation-exposed cohort was more likely to undergo total thyroidectomy, multiple operative procedures, and external radiotherapy. A higher percentage had multifocal disease, extrathyroid extension, stage IV disease, and distant metastases. At follow-up, fewer patients were free of disease, and more patients had died of thyroid disease. Conclusion(s): Patients who have been exposed to radiation have more aggressive disease and worse clinical outcome than other patients with thyroid cancer. © 2009 American Medical Association.

47,"The Assessment of the Integrated Antioxidant System of the Body in the Course of Radon Therapy: A Pilot Study Introduction. The sources of Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) in the organism are the respiratory processes occurring in cells catalyzed by different enzymes. Operation of ROS is balanced by antioxidants, the compounds; although present in low concentrations, they significantly inhibit the degree of oxidation of particular molecules. The Aim of the Study. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in the integrated antioxidant system under the influence of radon therapy in osteoarthritis patients. Material and Methods. Observation included 35 patients suffering from degenerative joints and disc disease (mean age 56.5 years) undergoing radon water therapy and control group that consisted of 15 osteoarthritis patients (mean age 54.2) without contact with radon water. Before therapy and after 18 days of treatment, serum total antioxidant status (TAS) was assessed with the use of standard colorimetric assay. Results. In the study group, we observed trends to increase TAS concentration, whereas, in the control group, TAS concentration was decreasing. Conclusions. (1) Radon waters treatment influenced the level of TAS of osteoarthritis patients treated with the radon water. (2) The change in TAS concentrations in the study group may be the result of low doses of ionizing radiation, but further studies on larger patient's groups are demanded.

Sensitisation to DNCB occurred in 52% of 37 patients but in 78% of controls. There was depression of lymphocyte transformation by PPD in 19 patients compared with controls (P=0.001), but there was no difference in lymphocyte transformation by PHA or pokeweed mitogen between 34 patients and controls. In a pilot study patients were randomly allocated to autograft (eight) or non-autograft (seven) groups. The autograft group were given an intradermal injection of a suspension of irradiated autologous tumour-cells mixed with intradermal BCG on the day of operation. Tests of cell-mediated immunity were repeated two weeks after operation. Five patients in each group received a course of radiotherapy to the mediastinum three weeks after operation. There was a rise in cutaneous tuberculin reactivity (P=0.08) and total leucocyte count (P=0.09) in the autograft group postoperatively with a fall in total lymphocyte and T lymphocyte counts in the non-autograft group (P less 0.05). These differences, however, were not followed by any difference in the frequency of tumour recurrence or the survival rate two years after operation. The results show that the immunological surveillance mechanism is impaired even in patients with early bronchial carcinoma and that it is possible to overcome postoperative immunological depression with specific immunotherapy combined with BCG. This treatment did not produce any clinical advantage in this small number of patients and the skin lesions caused the patients considerable discomfort.",Excluded,0.94687414

16,"A novel method of continuous cage-side monitoring of hyperthyroid cats treated with radio-iodine A continuous monitoring system (MGP DM2000X) was assessed for monitoring gamma radiation emissions and determining appropriate isolation times for hyperthyroid cats treated with radioactive iodine (I(131)). Daily radiation emitted by 12 cats who had received a range of doses of I(131) (80-200 MBq) was measured and average background radiation readings deducted. The effective half-lives of the I(131) in the cats were found to have a median of 2.54 days (range 1.40-3.24 days). Cats treated with 200 MBq emitted 5 microGy/day more exposure than cats treated with lower doses throughout the study period (P=0.032). All cats were found to emit a total radiation dose exposure less than 100 microGy (range 0-43 microGy) during days 18-21 of isolation. The potential additional dose exposure to owners was calculated at various days that might be considered for the cats to be returned to their owners. Using this provisional data, maximum isolation periods at this institution could be safely reduced to 17 days as long as certain precautions are followed. This preliminary study demonstrated that this novel cage-side monitoring system can be used to calculate the effective half-life of I(131) and to measure gamma radiation exposure from treated cats, which may assist other institutions in determining appropriate isolation times for individual cats.Copyright British Veterinary Association.",Excluded,0.946691
844,"Gut microbial dysbiosis is associated with development and progression of radiation enteritis during pelvic radiotherapy Radiation enteritis (RE) is the most common complication of radiotherapy for pelvic irradiation receivers. Herein we investigated the alterations in gut microbial profiles and their association with enteritis in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. Faecal samples were collected from 18 cervical cancer patients during radiotherapy. Microbiota profiles were characterized based on 16S rRNA sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Epithelial inflammatory response was evaluated using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures. Dysbiosis was observed among patients with RE, which was characterized by significantly reduced alpha-diversity but increased beta-diversity, relative higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria and lower abundance of Bacteroides. Coprococcus was clearly enriched prior to radiotherapy in patients who later developed RE. Metastat analysis further revealed unique grade-related microbial features, such as more abundant Virgibacillus and Alcanivorax in patients with mild enteritis. Additionally, using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures, RE patient-derived microbiota induced epithelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction, enhanced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta expression compared with control microbiota. Taken together, we define the overall picture of gut microbiota in patients with RE. Our results suggest that dysbiosis of gut microbiota may contribute to development and progression of RE. Gut microbiota can offer a set of biomarkers for prediction, disease activity evaluation and treatment selection in RE. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

469,"Health profiles of 996 melanoma survivors: The M. D. Anderson experience Background: The incidence and survival of melanoma are increasing, but little is known about its long-term health effects in adult survivors. Method(s): A health survey was available from 996 melanoma survivors (577 treated with surgery alone, and 391 with combined treatments). Their medical/physiologic and psychosocial responses were analyzed and compared with those of the survivors from other cancers. Result(s): The melanoma survivors were 44.8 +/- 12.8 years of age at diagnosis (significantly younger than the survivors of other cancers) and 63.7 +/- 12.8 years at survey. Melanoma survivors were less likely to report that cancer had affected their health than survivors of other cancers (15.8% vs. 34.9%). The 577 individuals treated with surgery alone reported arthritis/osteoporosis, cataracts, and heart problems most frequently (less often than survivors of other cancers). The 391 individuals who had undergone combined treatments reported circulation problems and kidney problems generally as often as survivors of other cancers. Health problems were not associated with number of decades since diagnosis but with age at diagnosis, treatment modality, and family relationships. Conclusion(s): We present information from a large cohort of long-term survivors of melanoma. As a group, they were less likely to report that cancer had affected their overall health than survivors of other cancers; a number of disease related and psychosocial factors appear to influence their health profiles. © 2006 Stava et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded,0.9463013
37,"Small Cell Lung Cancer. Methodology and Preliminary Results of the SMALL CELL Study INTRODUCTION: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive histologic type of lung cancer, and accounts for approximately 10%-15% of all cases. Few studies have analyzed the effect of residential radon. Our aim is to determine the risk factors of SCLC., METHODS: We designed a multicenter, hospital-based case-control study with the participation of 11 hospitals in 4 autonomous communities., RESULTS: Results of the first 113 cases have been analyzed, 63 of which included residential radon measurements. Median age at diagnosis was 63 years; 11% of cases were younger than 50 years of age; 22% were women; 57% had extended disease; and 95% were smokers or former smokers. Median residential radon concentration was 128Bq/m3. Concentrations higher than 400Bq/m3 were found in 8% of cases. The only remarkable difference by gender was the percentage of never smokers, which was higher in women compared to men (P<.001). Radon concentration was higher in patients with stageIV disease (non-significant difference) and in individuals diagnosed at 63 years of age or older (P=.032)., CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of SCLC cases are diagnosed early and there is a predominance of disseminated disease at diagnosis. Residential radon seems to play an important role on the onset of this disease, with some cases having very high indoor radon concentrations. Copyright © 2017 SEPAR.

537,"Cerebral metastases pathology after radiosurgery: a multicenter study BACKGROUND: To the authors' knowledge, comprehensive human pathologic investigations that explore fundamental radiosurgical effects on metastatic brain tumors are sparse in the literature. The objective of this study was to analyze histopathologic findings in a set of clinically recurrent cerebral metastases after patients underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)., METHODS: In a series of 7500 patients who underwent radiosurgery, 2020 patients (27%) harbored cerebral metastases. Eighteen of 2020 patients (0.9%) underwent subsequent craniotomy for tumor removal anywhere from 1 month to 59 months after they received high-dose irradiation. Histologic and immunohistochemical investigations were performed on the surgically resected tissue specimens. These specimens were within the radiosurgical treatment volume of the metastatic tumor., RESULTS: Light microscopy revealed 3 basic categories of histologic responses: acute-type, subacute-type, and chronic-type tissue reactions. A moderate-to-intense inflammatory cell reaction was seen in the tissue responses of well controlled neoplasms (i.e., in patients who had neoplasms that required craniotomy for recurrent disease > 5 months after SRS), whereas the inflammatory reaction was missing or sparse in poorly controlled neoplasms (patients who required craniotomy for recurrent disease < 5 months after SRS). This reaction was seen within the irradiated tumor volume and not in the peritumoral area nor in areas remote from the radiosurgical treatment volume. Immunohistochemical characterization demonstrated the presence of prominent CD68-positive macrophage and CD3-positive T-lymphocyte populations. A progressively severe vasculopathy also was observed with increasing time after radiosurgery., CONCLUSIONS: Although causality has not been established, a brisk inflammatory response and more severe vasculopathy were observed in lesions in which recurrences were more delayed.

Tissue engineering using biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is considered as a promising alternative. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of BCP and total fresh bone marrow (TBM) in regenerating irradiated bone defect. The aim of this study was to know if adding MSC to BCP + TBM mixture could improve the bone formation in irradiated bone defects. Twenty-four Lewis 1A rats received a single dose of 20 Gy to the hind limbs. MSC were sampled from non-irradiated donors and amplified in proliferative, and a part in osteogenic, medium. 3 weeks after, defects were created on femurs and tibias, which were filled with BCP alone, BCP + TBM, BCP + TBM + uncommitted MSC, or BCP + TBM + committed MSC. 3 weeks after, samples were removed and prepared for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The rate of bone ingrowth was significantly higher after implantation of BCP + TBM mixture. The adding of a high concentration of MSC, committed or not, didn't improve the bone regeneration. The association BCP + TBM remains the most efficient material for bone substitution in irradiated areas.Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded,0.94562775

The plating efficiency for 11 of the 14 melanomas studied was sufficiently high (PE = 0.3-58%) to measure cell survival over at least two decades. Experiments repeated with cells stored in liquid nitrogen showed that the survival assay gave highly reproducible results. The melanomas exhibited individual and characteristic survival curves whether exposed to radiation or heat (43.5 degrees C). The Do-values were in the ranges 0.63-1.66 Gy (X-rays) and 33-58 min (heat). The survival curves were similar to those reported previously for human melanoma xenografts. The radiation sensitivity of the cells was not correlated to the heat sensitivity. Since the melanomas appeared to be very heterogeneous in radiation response in vitro as melanomas are known to be clinically, it is suggested that melanomas may be suitable for prospective studies aimed at establishing whether clinical radioresponsiveness somehow is related to in vitro survival curve parameters.",Excluded,0.9456152
266,"The secondary sex ratio in Italy over the past eighty years (1940 to 2019) and potential impact of radiological contamination after atmospheric nuclear testing and after Chernobyl: Temporal change-point analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo In Europe, the male to female ratio at birth (secondary sex ratio: SSR; sex odds: SO) is 1.04-1.06, is influenced by many factors and is declining in industrialized countries. This study was carried out to identify possible impacts of fallout by atomic bomb tests or by the Chernobyl event on SSR in Italy. Italy is a country without commercial nuclear power generation for the last four decades and thus nearly free of radiological confounders. Counts of annual male and female live births in Italy are provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by the Italian Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT). This study included 57.7 million live births (1940-2019) with overall SSR 1.05829. The Italian SSR trend was modelled with linear and non-linear logistic regression. Trend changes, i.e., periods with level shifts were estimated with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Two distinct idealized level shifts were identified superimposed on a uniform secular downward trend. The first one is seen towards the end of the 1960s with a jump sex odds ratio (SOR) 1.00681, p < 0.0001. The second one occurred in 1987 with SOR 1.00474, p < 0.0001. In each of the 3 periods separated by the two jumps, SSR uniformly decreased with trend SOR per 100 years of 0.98549, p < 0.0001. In conclusion, the secular trend in the Italian SSR showed two marked level shifts, at the end of the 1960s and from 1987 onward. These follow the release of radioactivity by atmospheric atomic bomb tests during the 1960s and by Chernobyl in 1986 and corroborate the hypothesis that ionizing radiation increases SSR.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.9453191

An EcoRI restriction fragment-length polymorphism previously identified in XRCC1 did not correlate with the repair phenotypes of these cells. The mRNA of XRCC1 decreased to 20-40% after treatment of cells with a DNA damaging agent. XRCC1 also showed tissue specific expression in rats. The mRNA levels were high in testis (7-8 fold), ovary (3-4 fold) and brain (4-5 fold), when compared with those in intestine, liver and spleen (1-2 fold).

The target volumes in two patients with malignant tumors showed sharply demarcated coagulative necrosis. In the third patient, who had a benign acoustic nerve tumor, neuropathological examination found intratumoral hemorrhage and cyst formation, but no necrosis.

Experimental Design: Adult mice were infused with Alda-89 or vehicle before, during, and after radiotherapy. Saliva secretion was monitored weekly. Hematology, metabolic profile, and postmortem evaluation for toxicity were examined at the time of sacrifice. Alda-89 or vehicle was applied toHNCcell lines in vitro, and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice transplanted with HNC in vivo with or without radiation; HNC growth was monitored. The ALDH3A1 and ALDH3A2 protein expression was evaluated in 89 patients with HNC and correlated to freedom from relapse (FFR) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Alda-89 infusion significantly resulted in more whole saliva production and a higher percentage of preserved acini after radiotherapy compared with vehicle control. There was no difference in the complete blood count, metabolic profile, and major organ morphology between the Alda-89 and vehicle groups. Compared with vehicle control, Alda-89 treatment neither accelerated HNC cell proliferation in vitro, nor did it affect tumor growth in vivo with or without radiotherapy. Higher expression of ALDH3A1 orALDH3A2 was not significantly associated with worse FFR or OS in either human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive or HPV-negative group. Conclusion(s): Alda-89 preserves salivary function after radiotherapy without affecting HNC growth or causing measurable toxicity in mice.

1077,"Lung cancer and cigarette smoking in Europe: An update of risk estimates and an assessment of inter-country heterogeneity Ten case-control studies have been carried out in 6 European countries to investigate the major risk factors for lung cancer. Carcinogenic effect from cigarette smoke was the most relevant interest in our study, which has included 7,609 cases of lung cancer and 10,431 controls, mainly population based. The results indicate elevated odds ratios (ORs; 23.9 among men and 8.7 among women) with attributable risks exceeding 90% for men and close to 60% for women. A large, and statistically significant, variability of the results across countries was detected after adjusting for the most common confounding variables, and after controlling, at least in part, for the instability of the ORs due to the small number of non-smokers in some of the study subsets. This pattern of lung cancer risk associated with cigarettes smoke, across different European regions, reflects inherent characteristics of the studies as well as differences in smoking habits, particularly calender periods of starting, and it is likely to have been influenced by effect modifiers like indoor radon exposure, occupation, air pollution and dietary habits. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded,0.94449466

Within the latter designation, there was a higher rate of self-reported agricultural occupation (40% vs 10%, P < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): The increased incidence of hematologic cancer in low population density areas of south central North Dakota supports the need for more detailed prospective research centered on agricultural exposures.",Excluded,0.9437911
511,"Salivary gland cancer in the United States The risk of salivary gland cancer (SGC) is increased in atomic bomb survivors and after radiotherapy, but other risk factors are not well established. Some studies have suggested an association of SGC with breast cancer and with exposure to various viruses or UVB radiation. Corroborating evidence of these associations was sought by using population-based registries to examine the demographic distribution of SGC, patterns of secondary primary cancers after SGC, and risk of SGC with AIDS. SGC incidence per 100,000 persons did not change between 1973 and 1992, averaging 1.2 in males and 0.8 in females, with a steep age gradient. To examine the relationship between UVB exposure and SGC, population-based, age-adjusted incidence rates of SGC were plotted against the UVB insolation of each registry site. Regression analysis suggested no correlation between SGC incidence and increasing UVB insolation (beta = 0.10, R2 = 0.08). SGC also did not appear to be associated with second cancers that have been linked to herpes or papilloma viruses or with AIDS [observed/expected (O/E) ratio, <2.8], but all of these conditions are so uncommon that only very large relative risks would have been statistically significant. Women with SGC before age 35 had a statistically nonsignificant elevation in breast cancer risk [O/E, 3.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.66-9.65], and older women had no increased risk of breast cancer. SGC patients were at increased risk for nonsalivary, second-primary oropharyngeal cancers (O/E, 3.27; 95% CI, 2.00-5.05), thyroid cancer (O/E, 3.31; 95% CI, 1,07-7.73), and lung cancer (O/E, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.45-2.35), particularly in patients whose SGC was treated with radiotherapy (O/E, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.06-3.80). In summary, SGC remains rare and does not appear to be associated with AIDS, virally related malignancies, or UVB. Patients who have had SGC, however, should be monitored for subsequent oropharyngeal, thyroid, and lung cancers.",Excluded,0.94370776
439,"Comparative toxicity of synchrotron and conventional radiation therapy based on total and partial body irradiation in a murine model Synchrotron radiation can facilitate novel radiation therapy modalities such as microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) and high dose-rate synchrotron broad-beam radiation therapy (SBBR). Both of these modalities have unique physical properties that could be exploited for an improved therapeutic effect. While pre-clinical studies report promising normal tissue sparing phenomena, systematic toxicity data are still required. Our objective was to characterise the toxicity of SBBR and MRT and to calculate equivalent doses of conventional radiation therapy (CRT). A dose-escalation study was performed on C57BLJ/6 mice using total body and partial body irradiations. Dose-response curves and TD50 values were subsequently calculated using PROBIT analysis. For SBBR at dose-rates of 37 to 41 Gy/s, we found no evidence of a normal tissue sparing effect relative to CRT. Our findings also show that the MRT valley dose, rather than the peak dose, best correlates with CRT doses for acute toxicity. Importantly, longer-term weight tracking of irradiated animals revealed more pronounced growth impairment following MRT compared to both SBBR and CRT. Overall, this study provides the first in vivo dose-equivalence data between MRT, SBBR and CRT and presents systematic toxicity data for a range of organs that can be used as a reference point for future pre-clinical work.",Excluded,0.94284254
961,"RAD18 mediates resistance to ionizing radiation in human glioma cells Radioresistance remains a major challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). RAD18 a central regulator of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), has been shown to play an important role in regulating genomic stability and DNA damage response. In the present study, we investigate the relationship between RAD18 and resistance to ionizing radiation (IR) and examined the expression levels of RAD18 in primary and recurrent GBM specimens. Our results showed that RAD18 is an important mediator of the IR-induced resistance in GBM. The expression level of RAD18 in glioma cells correlates with their resistance to IR. Ectopic expression of RAD18 in RAD18-low A172 glioma cells confers significant resistance to IR treatment. Conversely, depletion of endogenous RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells sensitized these cells to IR treatment. Moreover, RAD18 overexpression confers resistance to IR-mediated apoptosis in RAD18-low A172 glioma cells, whereas cells deficient in RAD18 exhibit increased apoptosis induced by IR. Furthermore, knockdown of RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells disrupts HR-mediated repair, resulting in increased accumulation of DSB. In addition, clinical data indicated that RAD18 was significantly higher in recurrent GBM samples that were exposed to IR compared with the corresponding primary GBM samples. Collectively, our findings reveal that RAD18 may serve as a key mediator of the IR response and may function as a potential target for circumventing IR resistance in human GBM.

254,"Estimates of Environmental Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields and Risk of Lymphoma Subtypes We investigated the association between environmental exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) and risk of lymphoma subtypes in a case-control study comprised of 322 patients and 444 individuals serving as controls in Sardinia, Italy in 1998-2004. Questionnaire information included the self-reported distance of the three longest held residential addresses from fixed radio-television transmitters and mobile phone base stations. We georeferenced the residential addresses of all study subjects and obtained the spatial coordinates of mobile phone base stations. For each address within a 500-meter radius from a mobile phone base station, we estimated the RF-EMF intensity using predictions from spatial models, and we performed RF-EMF measurements at the door in the subset of the longest held addresses within a 250-meter radius. We calculated risk of lymphoma and its major subtypes associated with the RF-EMF exposure metrics with unconditional logistic regression, adjusting by age, gender and years of education. In the analysis of self-reported data, risk associated with residence in proximity (within 50 meters) to fixed radio-television transmitters was likewise elevated for lymphoma overall [odds ratio = 2.7, 95% confidence interval = 1.5-4.6], and for the major lymphoma subtypes. With reference to mobile phone base stations, we did not observe an association with either the self-reported, or the geocoded distance from mobile phone base stations. RF-EMF measurements did not vary by case-control status. By comparing the self-reports to the geocoded data, we discovered that the cases tended to underestimate the distance from mobile phone base stations differentially from the controls (P = 0.073). The interpretation of our findings is compromised by the limited study size, particularly in the analysis of the individual lymphoma subtypes, and the unavailability of the spatial coordinates of radio-television transmitters. Nonetheless, our results do not support the hypothesis of a link between environmental exposure to RF-EMF from mobile phone base stations and risk of lymphoma subtypes.Copyright © 2018 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.9417298
288,"The prostate cancer risk locus at 10q11 is associated with DNA repair capacity Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mildly predict prostate cancer risk. These SNPs are local tagging markers for causal gene alterations. Consideration of candidate genes in the tagged regions would be facilitated by additional information on the particular pathomechanisms which contribute to the observed risk increase. In this study we test for an association of prostate cancer tagging SNPs with alterations in DNA repair capacity, a phenotype that is frequently involved in cancer predisposition. DNA repair capacity was assessed on blood lymphocytes from 128 healthy probands after ionizing irradiation. We used the micronucleus (MN) assay to determine the cellular DNA double-strand break repair capacity and flow cytometry to measure damage induced mitotic delay (MD). Probands were genotyped for a panel of 14 SNPs, each representing an independent prostate cancer risk locus previously identified by GWAS. Associations between germline variants and DNA repair capacity were found for the SNPs rs1512268 (8p21), rs6983267 (8q24) and rs10993994 (10q11). The most significant finding was an association of homozygous rs10993994 T-allele carriers with a lower MN frequency (. p=. 0.0003) and also a decreased MD index (. p=. 0.0353). Cells with prostate cancer risk alleles at rs10993994 seem to cope more efficiently with DNA double strand breaks (less MN) in a shorter time (decreased MD index). This intriguing finding imposes concern about the accuracy of repair, with respect to the cancer risk that is mediated by T genotypes. To date, . MSMB (microseminoprotein beta) is favored as the causal gene at the 10q11 risk locus, since it was the first candidate gene known to be expressionally altered by rs10993994. Based on the present observation, candidate genes from the contexts of DNA repair and apoptosis may be more promising targets for expression studies with respect to the rs10993994 genotype. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.941259
38,"Impact of gamma radiation dose on sterility and quality parameters of Anastrepha fraterculus (Diptera: Tephritidae) Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann, 1830) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a major fruit pest, which is basicaly controlled using insecticides, which represents a risk to beneficial arthropods, human health and food contamination. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a potential alternative tool for the management of this pest, however, only conflicting data is found regarding the optimal dose to achieve sterility. Thus, this study evaluated the effect of gamma radiation doses (0, 40, 50, 60 and 70 Gy) on male and female reproductive sterility, gonads morphometry, emergence, flight ability, and longevity under nutritional stress of A. fraterculus. Full female sterility was achieved at 50 Gy, while full male sterility was achieved at 70 Gy. Both ovarian and testicular sizes were affected by irradiation, while no influence was observed on the quality parameters evaluated. Our results suggest that 70 Gy applied 48 h before adult emergence can be used to sterilize A. fraterculus in a SIT programme.",Excluded,0.941143
22,"Pleomorphic adenomas: post-operative radiotherapy is unnecessary following primary incomplete excision: a retrospective review BACKGROUND: Current standard treatment of Pleomorphic Salivary Adenoma (PSA) of the Parotid Gland is by surgical excision. The management of incomplete excision remains undecided with post-operative radiotherapy advocated by some and observation by others., METHODS: 190 patients who underwent resection of PSA of the parotid gland within the West of Scotland region from 1981 to 2008 were identified and data collected., RESULTS: 78/190 patients had a primary incomplete excision. 25/78 received post-operative radiotherapy and 53 were observed. Recurrences occurred in 11/53 in those observed and in 1/25 of those who received radiotherapy. 21/25 complained of significant side effects from the radiotherapy. 38 surgeons performed 190 procedures, with a range of experience from 1 to28 procedures., CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy does appear to reduce recurrence with incomplete excision, however it is associated with significant side effects. We therefore feel radiotherapy should not be routinely recommended. Subspecialisation should be adopted to increase the operating surgeon's experience.

349,"A Small Peptide Ac-SDKP Inhibits Radiation-Induced Cardiomyopathy BACKGROUND: Advances in radiotherapy for thoracic cancers have resulted in improvement of survival. However, radiation exposure to the heart can induce cardiotoxicity. No therapy is currently available to inhibit these untoward effects. We examined whether a small tetrapeptide, N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (Ac-SDKP), can counteract radiation-induced cardiotoxicity by inhibiting macrophage-dependent inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. METHODS AND RESULTS: After characterizing a rat model of cardiac irradiation with magnetic resonance imaging protocols, we examined the effects of Ac-SDKP in radiation-induced cardiomyopathy. We treated rats with Ac-SDKP for 18 weeks. We then compared myocardial contractile function and extracellular matrix by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and the extent of inflammation, fibrosis, and Mac-2 (galectin-3) release by tissue analyses. Because Mac-2 is a crucial macrophage-derived mediator of fibrosis, we performed studies to determine Mac-2 synthesis by macrophages in response to radiation, and change in profibrotic responses by Mac-2 gene depleted cardiac fibroblasts after radiation. Cardiac irradiation diminished myocardial contractile velocities and enhanced extracellular matrix deposition. This was accompanied by macrophage infiltration, fibrosis, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and cardiac Mac-2 expression. Ac-SDKP strongly inhibited these detrimental effects. Ac-SDKP migrated into the perinuclear cytoplasm of the macrophages and inhibited radiation-induced Mac-2 release. Cardiac fibroblasts lacking the Mac-2 gene showed reduced transforming growth factor beta1, collagen I, and collagen III expression after radiation exposure. CONCLUSION(S): Our study identifies novel cardioprotective effects of Ac-SDKP in a model of cardiac irradiation. These protective effects are exerted by inhibiting inflammation, fibrosis, and reducing macrophage activation. This study shows a therapeutic potential of this endogenously released peptide to counteract radiation-induced cardiomyopathy.",Excluded,0.94045866

The esophagectomy specimens were sampled at the resection margins, the edge of irradiated length, 1 cm from the proximal and distal edge of visible tumor, the center of the tumor, and the lymph nodes., RESULTS: Radiation change in the form of fibrosis was limited to the submucosa at the resection margins, the circular muscle layer at the edge of irradiated length, and full thickness at 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Surface epithelium did not show any changes at the resection margins but did show basal cell hyperplasia at the edge of the irradiated length and ulceration at 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Endarteritis obliterans was seen only 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Necrosis, intense keratin formation, and giant cell reaction were observed at the center of the tumor. When compared with the preradiotherapy biopsies, the amount of keratin in the postradiotherapy specimens was extensive. HDRILBT may cause induction of the keratin gene in the irradiated cells to stimulate differentiation toward better differentiated cells., CONCLUSIONS: HDRILBT may cause the keratin gene in the irradiated cells to induce differentiation toward better differentiated cells.

885,"Pre-apoptotic response to therapeutic DNA damage involves protein modulation of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3 in acute myeloid leukemia cells BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are characterized by non-mutated TP53, high levels of Hdm2, and frequent mutation of the Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase. The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis., RESULTS: Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis., CONCLUSION: Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients.",Excluded,0.94034433

Limited data are available regarding long-term vision-targeted health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adult retinoblastoma survivors. OBJECTIVE To examine vision-targeted HRQoL as reported on the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Field Questionnaire for overall and specific scale scores among adult survivors of retinoblastoma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Retinoblastoma Survivor Study is a retrospective cohort of adult retinoblastoma survivors treated at 3 academic medical centers in New York between 1932 and 1994. Participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire between April 2008 and June 2010. Items were scored in January 2013 and preliminary analyses were performed in July 2015. Models were finalized in May 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported vision-targeted HRQoL as reported on the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Field Questionnaire. Items are scored from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest quality of life. RESULTS Among 470 adult retinoblastoma survivors (53.6% with bilateral disease; 52.1% female; 86.4% white and non-Hispanic; mean age at study, 43.3 years; range, 18.0-77.0 years), 86% had at least 1 eye removed (1 eye, 74.5%; both eyes, 11.5%); 56.5% were previously treated with radiotherapy; and 61.3% rated their eyesight as excellent/good while 16.2% reported complete blindness. The overall mean (SD) VFQ composite score for all survivors was 81.1 (17.2) (mean [SD] score for unilateral retinoblastoma survivors, 91.4 [7.7]; bilateral retinoblastoma survivors, 72.3 [18.2]; difference between survivors with unilateral and bilateral disease, 19.1 [95% CI, 16.5-21.7; P < .001]). Prior exposure to radiotherapy was not associated with decreased overall VFQ (s = -0.08; 95% CI, -0.15 to 0.002; P = .06) but was related to a few specific subdomains of visual functioning. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest retinoblastoma-related oculo-visual problems are associated with functional status and vision-targeted HRQoL of adult survivors, particularly among those with bilateral disease.Copyright © 2018 American Medical Association.

A relationship between low-density lipoprotein oxidation and radioiodine therapy-related side effects, consequently inducing increased formation of 8-epi-prostaglandin F(2 alpha) (PGF(2 alpha)) in situ, has recently been reported by several investigators. Isoprostanes, among them 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha), have been associated with increased oxidation injury due to various pathologic conditions in vivo. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible induction of oxidative stress as a consequence of (131)I therapy., METHODS: 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha) was examined in plasma, serum, and urine in 42 patients undergoing radioiodine treatment of hyperthyroidism or thyroid cancer. The 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha) levels were analyzed daily for 1 wk and thereafter at different points up to 12 wk after treatment., RESULTS: The isoprostane levels showed an increase after application of radioiodine in all investigated compartments. The effect was significantly higher and longer lasting after higher-activity therapy (2,960 or 7,400 MBq) than after lower-activity therapy (185 or 740 MBq)., CONCLUSION: These findings document a significant, dose-dependent in vivo oxidation injury as a consequence of therapeutic radioiodine application to the salivary gland.",Excluded,0.9402536

Patients conditioned with TBI without lung shielding received a significantly higher total lung dose compared with the control group (p less than 0.0001). The 3-year leukaemia-free survival for patients receiving TBI without lung shielding is 54 +/- 18% versus 51 +/- 18% for patients receiving TBI with lung shielding (p = ns). There was no significant difference in the probability of leukaemia relapse (22 +/- 18% for TBI without lung shielding versus 24 +/- 18% for control group; p = ns). The probability of interstitial pneumonitis is 15 +/- 14% for TBI without lung shielding and 5 +/- 5% for TBI with lung shielding (p = ns). A higher incidence of lung fungal infection (15 versus 3%) and interstitial pneumonitis (12 versus 3%) has been documented in patients receiving TBI without lung shielding compared with the control group.

98,"Non-myeloablative busulfan chimeric mouse models are less pro-inflammatory than head-shielded irradiation for studying immune cell interactions in brain tumours Background: Chimeric mouse models generated via adoptive bone marrow transfer are the foundation for immune cell tracking in neuroinflammation. Chimeras that exhibit low chimerism levels, blood-brain barrier disruption and pro-inflammatory effects prior to the progression of the pathological phenotype, make it difficult to distinguish the role of immune cells in neuroinflammatory conditions. Head-shielded irradiation overcomes many of the issues described and replaces the recipient bone marrow system with donor haematopoietic cells expressing a reporter gene or different pan-leukocyte antigen, whilst leaving the blood-brain barrier intact. However, our previous work with full body irradiation suggests that this may generate a pro-inflammatory peripheral environment which could impact on the brain's immune microenvironment. Our aim was to compare non-myeloablative busulfan conditioning against head-shielded irradiation bone marrow chimeras prior to implantation of glioblastoma, a malignant brain tumour with a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Method(s): Recipient wild-type/CD45.1 mice received non-myeloablative busulfan conditioning (25 mg/kg), full intensity head-shielded irradiation, full intensity busulfan conditioning (125 mg/kg) prior to transplant with whole bone marrow from CD45.2 donors and were compared against untransplanted controls. Half the mice from each group were orthotopically implanted with syngeneic GL-261 glioblastoma cells. We assessed peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen chimerism, multi-organ pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles at 12 weeks and brain chimerism and immune cell infiltration by whole brain flow cytometry before and after implantation of glioblastoma at 12 and 14 weeks respectively. Result(s): Both non-myeloablative conditioning and head-shielded irradiation achieve equivalent blood and spleen chimerism of approximately 80%, although bone marrow engraftment is higher in the head-shielded irradiation group and highest in the fully conditioned group. Head-shielded irradiation stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood and spleen but not in the brain, suggesting a systemic response to irradiation, whilst non-myeloablative conditioning showed no cytokine elevation. Non-myeloablative conditioning achieved higher donor chimerism in the brain after glioblastoma implantation than head-shielded irradiation with an altered immune cell profile. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that non-myeloablative conditioning generates a more homeostatic peripheral inflammatory environment than head-shielded irradiation to allow a more consistent evaluation of immune cells in glioblastoma and can be used to investigate the roles of peripheral immune cells and bone marrow-derived subsets in other neurological diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded,0.9376742

In contrast to upward trends observed for older men and women (i.e., over 40), downward trends were noted for younger age groups. The risk of dying from skin melanoma appears to have peaked for male cohorts born during the 1950s and for female cohorts born during the 1930s. Assuming no future environmental or lifestyle changes, the upward trend in age-adjusted mortality rates, which averaged 2 to 3% per annum since 1950, is projected to discontinue and bend downward by the second decade of the 21st century. Skin melanoma incidence data, which was limited to a series of 12 years (1973-84) and inadequate for cohort analyses, were included to demonstrate that trends in age-specific rates were comparable with those observed for mortality during the overlapping time period.

Several flavonoids are known to be good antioxidants. Therefore, the effect of orientin and vicenin on radiation-induced lipid peroxidation in vivo and their antioxidant activity in vitro were studied. Adult mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mug/kg of orientin or vicenin and exposed whole-body to 3 Gy of gamma radiation. Lipid peroxidation was measured in the liver 15 min to 8 h postirradiation. The antioxidant activity of orientin/vicenin (10-500 muM) was studied by measuring inhibition of hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction (Fe3+-EDTA-ascorbic acid-H2O2) in vitro. The compounds were also tested for possible pro-oxidant and iron chelation activities at the above concentrations in the in vitro system. Orientin and vicenin provided almost equal protection against radiation-induced lipid peroxidation in mouse liver. Both compounds showed a significantly greater free radical-inhibiting activity in vitro than DMSO. Neither orientin nor vicenin showed any pro-oxidant activity at the concentrations tested. Both compounds inhibited free radical formation in the absence of EDTA. Free radical scavenging appears to be a likely mechanism of radiation protection by these flavonoids.

However, in the field of oral squamous cell carcinoma, evaluation of host immune response on the basis of proliferative activity of tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TIL) has not been reported. Therefore, we applied double immunohistochemical staining of proliferation markers Ki-67 and CD8 to surgically resected and paraffin-embedded tissue sections for 35 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma. With this method, there was a significant correlation between the percentage of Ki-67+CD8+TIL and the intra-tumor epithelium infiltration rate of CD8+TIL (P=0.0237). In the process of analysis, we found that the proliferative activity of CD8+TIL tended to correlate (P=0.0859) with clinical N factor (lymph node metastasis), which was previously reported to suppress host immune response. We therefore assumed there was another factor inducing host immune response. The proliferative activity of CD8+TIL was well correlated with preoperative radiotherapy (P=0.0200) while there was no significant correlation between the proliferative activity of CD8+TIL and other clinical factors; age, tumor size, clinical stage, pathological N factor (P=0.5410, 0.7769, 0.1041, and 0.1072, respectively).

957,"Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase Upregulation by Phenylephrine Reduces Radiation Injury in Submandibular Gland PURPOSE: Radiation therapy for head and neck cancer commonly leads to radiation sialadenitis. Emerging evidence has indicated that phenylephrine pretreatment reduces radiosensitivity in the salivary gland; however, the underlying cytoprotective mechanism remains unclear. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is not only a key enzyme for the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide salvage pathway, but also a cytokine participating in cell survival, metabolism, and longevity, with a broad effect on cellular functions in physiology and pathology. However, the regulatory events of NAMPT in response to the irradiated salivary gland are unknown., METHODS AND MATERIALS: The cell viability of primary cultured submandibular gland cells was determined using the PrestoBlue assay. NAMPT expression was measured using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting in vitro and in vivo. Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and phosphorylated Akt protein levels were examined by Western blotting. The cellular locations of NAMPT and SIRT1 were detected by immunohistochemistry. NAMPT promoter activity was assessed using the luciferase reporter gene assay., RESULTS: NAMPT was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of granular convoluted tubule cells and ductal cells in normal submandibular glands. mRNA and protein expression of NAMPT was downregulated after radiation but upregulated with phenylephrine pretreatment both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the protein expression of phosphorylated Akt and SIRT1 was decreased in irradiated glands, and phenylephrine pretreatment restored the expression of both. SIRT1 was mainly located in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm in the normal submandibular gland. Phenylephrine dramatically enhanced the expression of SIRT1, which was significantly reduced by radiation. Furthermore, phenylephrine induced a marked increase of NAMPT promoter activity., CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the regulatory mechanisms of NAMPT expression, which help to understand the mechanism of the cytoprotective role of phenylephrine on irradiated tissues.

428,"Phosphorylation of Ser312 contributes to tumor suppression by p53 in vivo The tumor suppressor p53 is a master sensor of stress, and posttranslational modifications are key in controlling its stability and transcriptional activities. p53 can be phosphorylated on at least 23 Ser/Thr residues, the majority of which are phosphorylated by stress-related kinases. An exception is Ser315 in human p53 (Ser312 in mouse), which is predominantly phosphorylated by cell cyclerelated kinases. To understand the biological importance of Ser312 phosphorylation in vivo, wegenerated p53Ser312Ala knock-in mice. We show here that, although Ser312 is not essential for mouse life span under normal physiological conditions, Ser312Ala mutation dampens p53's activity during embryonic development. This is evident from its partial rescue of embryonic lethality caused by Mdm4 deletion. In agreement with the notion that Ser312 mutation weakens p53 function, Ser312Ala mice are alsomore susceptible to tumorigenesis following a sublethal ionizing radiation dose. Importantly, in the cohort studied, Ser312 mutation predisposes mice to develop thymic lymphomas and liver tumors, partly due to p53Ser312Ala's inability to fully induce a set of p53 target genes including p21 and cyclin G1. Thus, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser312 is required for p53 to function fully as a tumor suppressor in vivo.",Excluded,0.9273493

The photon fluences giving a unit absorbed dose to the target organ were estimated by using photon energy spectra together with the dose conversion coefficients given in ICRP Publication 116 for the target organs of the colon, bone marrow, stomach, lung, skin and breast with three irradiation geometries. As a result, it was demonstrated that the weighted LET values did not show a clear difference among the photon radiation fields subjected to epidemiological studies, regardless of the target organ and the irradiation geometry.",Excluded,0.9265173
355,"Fast-neutron irradiation of glioblastoma multiforme. Neuropathological analysis Various modes of therapy, alone or in combination, have had little effect in improving the survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Recently, in a pilot study, 34 patients with glioblastoma were treated by fast-neutron-beam irradiation of the whole brain. Following treatment, the patients became steroid-dependent and pursued a gradual downhill course with increasing obtundation. Although there was no improvement in the length or quality of survival of these patients, neuropathological studies in the 13 patients who came to autopsy showed the following: 1) extensive coagulative necrosis of much of the tumor mass; 2) dense infiltration by collagenous connective tissue; 3) minimal phagocytic reaction; 4) marked reduction in the amount of viable tumor; 5) abnormal astrocytic proliferation, which may represent either astrocytoma or a radiation-induced bizarre gliosis, and 6) areas of gliosis and white matter degeneration in the brain stem, remote form the tumor site. These observations suggest that continued efforts to further refine this mode of therapy for glioblastoma are warranted.",Excluded,0.9264337
922,"Comparison of the micronucleus and chromosome aberration techniques for the documentation of cytogenetic damage in radiochemotherapy-treated patients with rectal cancer PURPOSE: The goal of the interdisciplinary Clinical Research Unit KFO179 (Biological Basis of Individual Tumor Response in Patients with Rectal Cancer) is to develop an individual Response and Toxicity Score for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. The aim of the present study was to find a reliable and sensitive method with easy scoring criteria and high numbers of cell counts in a short period of time in order to analyze DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Thus, the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay and the chromosome aberration technique (CAT) were tested., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from 22 patients with rectal cancer before (0 Gy), during (21.6 Gy), and after (50.4 Gy) radiochemotherapy were stimulated in vitro by phytohemagglutinin (PHA); the cultures were then processed for the CBMN assay and the CAT to compare the two methods., RESULTS: A significant increase of chromosomal damage was observed in the course of radiochemotherapy parallel to increasing radiation doses, but independent of the chemotherapy applied. The equivalence of both methods was shown by Westlake's equivalence test., CONCLUSION: The results show that the CBMN assay and the CAT are equivalent. For further investigations, we prefer the CBMN assay, because it is simpler through easy scoring criteria, allows high numbers of cell counts in less time, is reliable, sensitive, and has higher statistical power. In the future, we plan to integrate cytogenetic damage during radiochemotherapy into the planned Response and Toxicity Score within our interdisciplinary Clinical Research Unit.",Excluded,0.9263987
1147,"Epidemiological features of brain tumors Brain tumors account for 1.4% of all cancers and 2.4% of all cancer-related deaths. The incidence of brain tumors varies and it is higher in developed countries of Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. In Serbia, according to data from 2009, malignant brain tumors account for 2.2 of all tumors, and from all cancer-related deaths, 3.2% is caused by malignant brain tumors. According to recent statistical reports, an overall incidence of brain tumors for benign and malignant tumors combined is 18.71 per 100,000 persons/year. The most common benign brain tumor in adults is meningioma, which is most present in women, and the most common malignant tumor is glioblastoma, which is most present in adult men. Due to high mortality, especially in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma and significant brain tumor morbidity, there is a constant interest in understanding its etiology in order to possibly prevent tumor occurrence in future and enable more efficient treatment strategies for this fatal brain disease. Despite the continuously growing number of epidemiological studies on possible factors of tumor incidence, the etiology remains unclear. The only established environmental risk factor of gliomas is ionizing radiation exposure. Exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields via cell phone use has gained a lot of attention as a potential risk factor of brain tumor development. However, studies have been inconsistent and inconclusive, so more definite results are still expected.",Excluded,0.92626524
999,"Characteristics, sources and health risk assessment of airborne particulate PAHs in Chinese cities: A review Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic compounds composed of at least two benzene rings. This paper reviews the characteristics, sources and health risk of airborne particulate PAHs in Chinese cities. The airborne particulate PAH concentrations varied from 3.35 to 910ngm-3, with an average of 75.0ngm-3, and the pollution level of PAHs in northern cities was generally higher than that in southern cities. The PAH concentrations in different cities underwent similar seasonal variations, with high concentrations in the winter and relatively low concentrations in the summer. Many factors, such as meteorological conditions and source emissions, influenced the spatiotemporal pattern of PAHs. High temperatures, frequent flow exchanges, abundant rainfall and strong solar radiation reduced the level of particulate PAHs in the atmosphere. The historical changes in the level of airborne particulate PAHs in four cities were analyzed. The PAH concentrations in Beijing and Taiyuan presented a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, while the level of particulate PAHs in Nanjing and Guangzhou had a decreasing tendency from year 2000-2015. The airborne particulate PAHs in cities were derived from several sources, including coal combustion, vehicle emissions, coking industries, biomass burning and petroleum volatilization. The results of a health risk assessment indicated that the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for people in the northern cities was higher than that for people in the other regions, especially during the cold season. Moreover, adults were at greater risk than people in other age groups, and the health risk to females was slightly higher than that to males. The potential risk of airborne particulate PAH exposure was relatively high in some cities, and controlling PAH emissions at the source should be required to prevent pollution.

696,"Analysis of 66 patients definitive with transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease and the effect of universal irradiation of blood Background: Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) is a potentially fatal adverse reaction to blood transfusion. Although TA-GVHD was formerly considered to be rare and to occur only in immunocompromised patients, it was confirmed to occur even in immunocompetent patients in Japan, based on a definitive diagnostic test for TA-GVHD using highly polymorphic microsatellite repeat sequences. We clarify the clinical picture of TA-GVHD via definitive diagnosed cases and argue the validity of blood irradiation for TA-GVHD prevention. Patients and Methods: Two-hundred and ninety patients who were suspected of having TA-GVHD and referred to us for diagnostic testing from October 1992 to August 1999 were analysed for the associated clinical characteristics and risk factors. Effects of universal irradiation were followed up until 2010. Result(s): Sixty-six of the 290 study patients were diagnosed as having definite TA-GVHD by microsatellite DNA analysis. Regarding the symptoms of patients with definite TA-GVHD, a fever of over 38degreeC, erythema and leucocytopenia were found in virtually all of these patients. Among patients in whom human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typing was carried out, TA-GVHD almost always developed in HLA heterozygous patients following the transfusion of HLA homozygous blood. TA-GVHD was reported significantly more frequently in older patients. In this study, TA-GVHD was caused by the transfusion of HLA one-way match blood stored for 14days. Conclusion(s): No cases of TA-GVHD development have been confirmed since 2000, when the supply of irradiated blood products became widespread. No major problems have been encountered since the start of universal irradiation, more than 10years ago. © 2013 British Blood Transfusion Society.",Excluded,0.92385405
686,"Does hyperbaric oxygen administration before or after irradiation decrease side effects of irradiation on implant sites? One of the main limitations of implant-based breast reconstruction is the high rate of complications such as capsular contracture and poor aesthetic outcome, due to adjuvant radiotherapy. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) has been used to assist wound healing in the prevention and treatment of the side effects of irradiation. We aimed to investigate this effect of HBOT on the capsule reaction and skin, applied before and after irradiation, following the placement of an implant under the dorsal skin of the rat. Fifteen Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. A 18-mL smooth testicular implant was introduced into a subcutaneous pocket located on the dorsum of each rat. A single dose of 17-Gy irradiation was given to the implanted area of each rat at the third week. HBOT which lasted 3 weeks was administered to group I before irradiation, group II after irradiation. The control group did not receive HBOT. All of the rats were killed at the ninth week (6 weeks after irradiation). The dorsal skin with the capsule overlying the implant were excised for histopathological processing. The thickness of the capsule reaction of each group was evaluated statistically. Our histopathological examination revealed changes due to radiation in the control group. Many of these findings were found to be more subtle in group I and nearly absent in the group II. There was not any statistical difference between the thickness of the capsule reactions of the control group and group I, or group I and group II, but the capsular thickness of the control group was statistically higher than group II. It can be predicted that the use of HBOT following irradiation is an effective tool to reduce the capsule reaction of the implanted area and the tissue damage seen in radiodermatitis.",Excluded,0.9228836

Protection from cosmic radiation of crews of long-term space missions is now becoming an urgent requirement to allow a safe colonization of the moon and Mars. Epidemiology provides little help to quantify the risk, because the astronaut group is small and as yet mostly involved in low-Earth orbit mission, whilst the usual cohorts used for radiation protection on Earth (e.g. atomic bomb survivors) were exposed to a radiation quality substantially different from the energetic charged particle field found in space. However, there are over 260,000 patients treated with accelerated protons or heavier ions for different types of cancer, and this cohort may be useful for quantifying the effects of space-like radiation in humans. Space radiation protection and particle therapy research also share the same tools and devices, such as accelerators and detectors, as well as several research topics, from nuclear fragmentation cross sections to the radiobiology of densely ionizing radiation.

Several published prognostic gene expression signatures were evaluated within this set. These consisted of different radiotherapy relevant signatures (i.e. for hypoxia, proliferation and 'stemness'). Signatures were correlated with various endpoints that have been determined in the ten different xenograft models. These include immunohistochemical measures for hypoxia and proliferation, volume doubling time (VDT) and local tumour control after fractionated irradiation or after single dose irradiation under clamp hypoxia., RESULTS: We found several significant correlations between the published gene expression signatures and tumour parameters. Several signatures, like the proliferation and wound signature correlated with BrdU labelling index.

44,"Radiation sensitivity in vitro of primary tumors and metastatic lesions of malignant melanoma The radiation sensitivity of cells isolated directly from surgical specimens of the primary tumor and one to three distant metastases in ten different melanoma patients was measured in vitro using the Courtenay soft agar colony assay. Dose-response curves were fitted to the cell survival data by the method of least squares using the multitarget-single hit and the linear-quadratic models. The ten patients could be divided into three distinct groups. Group I consisted of four patients with radioresistant primary tumors (D0s from 1.38 +/- 0.06 Gy to 1.69 +/- 0.08 Gy). The radiation sensitivity of the metastases (D0s from 1.33 +/- 0.10 Gy to 1.73 +/- 0.06 Gy) was not significantly different from that of the primary tumor in this group; i.e., no heterogeneity was observed. Group II consisted of three patients with radiosensitive primary tumors (D0s from 0.84 +/- 0.06 Gy to 0.91 +/- 0.05 Gy). Heterogeneity was not observed in this group either; i.e., all metastases were radiosensitive (D0s from 0.85 +/- 0.05 Gy to 1.00 +/- 0.06 Gy). Group III consisted of three patients with a heterogeneous disease. The primary tumor of all patients in this group was radiosensitive (D0s from 0.85 +/- 0.05 Gy to 1.03 +/- 0.05 Gy). The most radioresistant metastasis in each patient was significantly (P much less than 0.05) more resistant (D0s from 1.46 +/- 0.06 Gy to 1.56 +/- 0.07 Gy) than the primary tumor. None of the metastases were significantly more radiosensitive than the primary tumor in any patient. These observations suggest that the progression of tumors to increased levels of malignancy includes the increased ability to become radioresistant, and it may be speculated that similar genomic alterations are responsible for the development of the metastatic and the radioresistant tumor cell phenotype. If so, this may have severe implications for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma with low linear energy transfer ionizing radiation as well as for the development of predictive assays for tumor treatment sensitivity.",Excluded,0.91970336
311,"Radiation Dose-Dependent Hippocampal Atrophy Detected With Longitudinal Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging PURPOSE: After radiation therapy (RT) to the brain, patients often experience memory impairment, which may be partially mediated by damage to the hippocampus. Hippocampal sparing in RT planning is the subject of recent and ongoing clinical trials. Calculating appropriate hippocampal dose constraints would be improved by efficient in vivo measurements of hippocampal damage. In this study we sought to determine whether brain RT was associated with dose-dependent hippocampal atrophy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Hippocampal volume was measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 52 patients who underwent fractionated, partial brain RT for primary brain tumors. Study patients had high-resolution, 3-dimensional volumetric MRI before and 1 year after RT. Images were processed using software with clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration and Conformite Europeene marking for automated measurement of hippocampal volume. Automated results were inspected visually for accuracy. Tumor and surgical changes were censored. Mean hippocampal dose was tested for correlation with hippocampal atrophy 1 year after RT. Average hippocampal volume change was also calculated for hippocampi receiving high (>40 Gy) or low (<10 Gy) mean RT dose. A multivariate analysis was conducted with linear mixed-effects modeling to evaluate other potential predictors of hippocampal volume change, including patient (random effect), age, hemisphere, sex, seizure history, and baseline volume. Statistical significance was evaluated at alpha = 0.05., RESULTS: Mean hippocampal dose was significantly correlated with hippocampal volume loss (r=-0.24, P=.03). Mean hippocampal volume was significantly reduced 1 year after high-dose RT (mean -6%, P=.009) but not after low-dose RT. In multivariate analysis, both RT dose and patient age were significant predictors of hippocampal atrophy (P<.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The hippocampus demonstrates radiation dose-dependent atrophy after treatment for brain tumors. Quantitative MRI is a noninvasive imaging technique capable of measuring radiation effects on intracranial structures. This technique could be investigated as a potential biomarker for development of reliable dose constraints for improved cognitive outcomes. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

481,"Cumulative radiation dose from medical imaging procedures in patients undergoing resection for lung cancer Background: Radiation dose from diagnostic imaging procedures is not monitored in patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer. Evidence suggests an increased lifetime risk of malignancy of 1.0% per 100 millisieverts (mSv). As such, recommendations are to restrict healthcare and radiation workers to a maximum dose of 50 mSv per year or to 100 mSv over a three-year period. The purpose of this study was to estimate cumulative effective doses of radiation in patients undergoing lung cancer resection and to determine predictors of increased exposure. Method(s): We identified 94 consecutive patients undergoing resection for non-small cell lung cancer. Radiologic procedures performed from one year prior to resection until two years postresection were recorded. Estimates of effective doses (mSv) were obtained from published literature and institutional records. Predictors of dose greater than 50 mSv per year and greater than 100 mSv per three years were examined statistically. Result(s): The majority of patients (median age = 67 years) had stage IA cancer (52%). In the three-year period, patients had 1,958 radiologic studies (20.8/patient) including 398 computed tomographic (CT) scans (4.23/patient) and 211 positron emission tomography (PET) scans (2.24 per patient). The three-year median estimated radiation dose was 84.0 mSv (interquartile range, 44.1 to 123.2 mSv). The highest dose was in the preoperative year. In any one year, 66% of patients received more than 50 mSv, while 19% received over 100 mSv. Over the three-year period, 43.6% of patients exceeded 100 mSv. The majority of the radiation (89.8%) was from CT or PET scans. On multivariate analysis, a history of previous malignancy (odds ratio [OR] 3.8; confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 12.7), postoperative complications (OR 6.16; CI 1.42 to 26.6), and postoperative surveillance with PET-CT (OR 13.2; CI 4.34 to 40.3) predicted exposure greater than 100 mSv over the three-year period. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that lung cancer patients often receive a higher dose of radiation than that considered safe for healthcare and radiation workers. The median cumulative dose reported in this study could potentially increase the individual estimated lifetime cancer risk by as much as 0.8%. Although risk-benefit considerations are clearly different between these groups, strategies should be in place to decrease radiation doses during the preoperative workup and postoperative period. © 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",Excluded,0.918799
869,"Host and tumor immunity: Local and systemic opportunities to enhance tumor curability by radiotherapy Success of radiation treatment depends on intrinsic properties of tumor cells, involvement of the host immune system and the crosstalk between tumor and host cells in primary and secondary (metastatic) sites. During the last decade our laboratory has investigated the role of these interactions in the ability of radiotherapy to eradicate primary tumors and metastatic disease. In the current presentation we will focus on host factors which interact with ionizing radiation (IR). The results of our studies using genetic models and specific immunological probes have identified CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, professional antigen presenting cells (CD11c+ dendritic cells), local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and host Type I Interferons (IFNs) as required for successful treatment by radiation 1,2. Transformation of the tumor microenvironment into an ""immunological hub"" to suppress local and distant disease is a tantalizing goal for which radiotherapy might be well suited, especially in combination with immunotherapy. , Our group has recently demonstrated that the combination of radiotherapy and anti-PD-L1 antibodies decrease accumulation and function of myeloid derived suppressor cells(CD11b,Gr1+) through enhanced local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs). in experimental systems3,4 The capacity of local radiotherapy to augment the activation TILs and drive cytokine production is, in part, due to the ability to increase tumor antigen cross-presentation by professional antigen presenting cells in the tumor stroma. Our group demonstrated host type I IFNs are essential for enhanced tumor antigen cross-presentation following radiotherapy. The critical role of type I IFNs in the host immune response to radiotherapy positions them as central components in the crosstalk between tumor cells and the host that can exert positive or negative influences depending on the context. In particular, the interaction of tumor cells with the host leads to the selection of clones resistant to the cytotoxic effects of IFNs and radiotherapy. Using transcriptomic approaches we identified a set of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) associated with tumor radioresistance.5 This gene set was identified in different types of primary tumors (lung, prostate, breast and glioblastoma) and termed the Interferon Related DNA Damage Signature (IRDS). Statistical training of this gene set detected a 7 gene signature which predicted response to adjuvant radio/chemotherapy for some woman with breast cancer 6. The IRDS is prognostic for patients with subsets of glioma and prostate cancer. We propose that these data indicate the presence of pro-survival genes in the IFN/Jak/Stat axis, which has been confirmed recently through a genomics approach The Jak-Stat pathway is currently under investigation as a potential therapeutic target for radio-chemosensitization in different tumor types. Our current approaches are directed towards identification of tumor ISGs with pro-survival/radioprotective functions.

We quantitatively assessed the gustatory function of patients with head and neck cancers who underwent radiotherapy using recently developed standardised tools for measuring taste. Method(s): Twenty patients undergoing head and neck irradiation responded to a specific questionnaire and were assessed by olfactory and gustatory function tests. To assess changes over time, testing was performed before, immediately after, and at 2- and 4-week intervals following the start of radiotherapy. Concurrently, patients were evaluated for xerostomia from radiotherapy. Result(s): A decrease in the taste recognition threshold was observed in the second week after the beginning of radiotherapy. The taste detection threshold improved within the 14th-18th week. Most affected patients demonstrated that their gustatory function primarily decreased independent of the olfactory function. Disturbances in taste were exponentially worsened beyond an accumulated dose of 30 Gy and involved all tastants. According to a multivariate analysis, radiation-induced taste impairment was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia. However, there was an association between the dose of irradiation and the severity of taste disturbance. Conclusion(s): In this preliminary study, we found that the taste function was worse 2 weeks after the start of radiotherapy and returned to pretreatment levels within 4.5 months. Taste disturbances were exponentially worse beyond an accumulated dose of 20 Gy. Taste dysfunction after radiotherapy was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia, whereas only the dose of irradiation was associated with the severity of taste dysfunction.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded,0.9147437

Cytogenetic analysis was applied to eight patients, all treated for the same tumour localisation; the same localisation was used to prevent the variability usually observed between patients treated with radiotherapy and to allow the corresponding roles of the size of irradiation field and of the dose rate to be studied. The yield of dicentrics, centric rings and fragments was measured in blood samples taken before treatment, during the course of radiotherapy and up to 6 months after. After the first fraction of radiotherapy, we observed that the whole-body dose estimated from the yield of dicentrics and rings was higher (0.35+/-0.2 Gy) than the calculated equivalent whole-body dose (0.07+/-0.04 Gy). By contrast, the partial-body dose derived from the Qdr (quotient of dicentrics and rings) model was estimated to be 2.2+/-0.3 Gy, which agreed quite well with the dose delivered to the tumour (2.1+/-0.1 Gy). We also found a correlation between the yield of induced chromosome aberrations and the target field size (p = 0.014). U-value analysis showed that the distribution of dicentrics and rings was overdispersed, despite the fractionation of the exposure, and a positive correlation between the U-value and the dose rate was observed (p = 0.017).

Rats bearing small tumors, treated with carboplatin and X-irradiation, had a mean survival time (MST) of 83.4 d following CED and 111.8 d following pump delivery with 40% of the latter surviving >180 d (i.e. cured) compared to 55.2 d for CED and 77.2 d. for pump delivery of carboplatin alone and 31.8 d and 24.2 d, respectively, for X-irradiated and untreated controls. There was no microscopic evidence of residual tumor in the brains of all long-term survivors. Not surprisingly, rats with large tumors had much shorter MSTs. Only modest increases in MSTs were observed in animals that received either oral administration or CED of temozolomide plus X-irradiation (23.2 d and 29.3 d) compared to X-irradiation alone. The present survival data, and those previously reported by us, are among the best ever obtained with the F98 glioma model.

The ability of the native endotoxic glycolipid (GL) from S. minnesota (R595) as well as diphosphoryl lipid A (LAD) and nontoxic monophosphoryl lipid A (LAM) derived from GL to protect LPS responsive (CD2F1 or C3H/HeN) and nonresponsive (C3H/HeJ) mice from 60Co gamma irradiation has been studied. Administration of GL, LAD, or LAM to CD2F1 or C3H/HeN mice (400 micrograms/kg) 24 h prior to exposure provided significant radioprotection. No protection was afforded to C3H/HeJ mice. Experiments were also conducted to determine the relative abilities of GL, LAD, and LAM to stimulate hematopoiesis as reflected by the endogenous spleen colony (E-CFU) assay. Protection was not correlated with the ability of these substances to increase E-CFUs or to induce colony-stimulating activity (CSA).",Excluded,0.9059942
386,"Therapeutic action of radioprotector indometofen The experiments on mice and dogs have shown the effectiveness of indomethofene administration after total acute radiation exposure. Introduction of indomethofene at doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg during time from 30 min to 3 days after irradiation resulted in reliable increase of mice survivability, 40-60% on average. Mice survival rate after single peroral introduction of indomethofene radioprotective doses was comparable with that resulting from referencing preparation estrofeme, which is estradiol oral dosage from (under the assumption that in contrast to indometafene estrofeme was introduced repeatedly every other day from 3 till 21 day after irradiation). Therapeutic action of indomethofene was confirmed in the experiments on dogs. After radiation exposure at a dose which caused the death of all dogs of control group, survival rate of experimental animals which received single oral dosage form of indomethofene at radioprotective dose in 1 and 3 days after irradiation was 40%. This study showed that indomethofene--long-acting radioprotector--is effective as therapeutic agent for acute radiation damage treatment.",Excluded,0.9053614

Epidermal melanin in 5mum thick vertical paraffin embedded sections of eighty human skin samples were studied with light microscopy from different age and ethnic groups with schmort technique. The quantity of epidermal melanin diminished as the age advanced. There was no significant difference among different ethnic groups in Pakistan, and the amount of epidermal melanin was significantly higher in exposed than in unexposed parts of body among the population of Karachi. The distribution of epidermal melanin appeared to be inversely proportional to the advancing age, it remained constant among different ethnic groups of Pakistan, but the intensity was significantly higher in exposed than in unexposed parts of body among Karachiites.",Excluded,0.9035808
945,"Citrus consumption is associated with risk of malignant melanoma Citrus products are dietary sources of psoralens, a group of chemicals that have photocarcinogenic properties. We examined the association between citrus consumption and subsequent incident malignant melanoma among participants in the Nurses' Health Study (1984-2010) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2010). Among 105,437 participants over 2 million person-years of follow-up, we documented 1857 incident melanomas. The pooled multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio for melanoma comparing the extreme total citrus consumption categories (1.5 or more serving per day vs. less than twice per week) was 1.30 (95 confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 1.57) (P=0.003 for trend). Grapefruit and orange juice were two individual citrus products that showed significant associations with risk of melanoma. The pooled multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for melanoma were 1.41 (95% CI, 1.09 to 1.82) comparing the extreme consumption categories of grapefruit (three times or more per week vs. never, P=0.004 for trend) and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.56) comparing the extreme consumption categories of orange juice (once or more per day vs. never, P=0.001 for trend). Significant positive associations between citrus consumption and risk of melanoma were also observed for invasive melanoma and melanoma that occurred on the head, neck and extremities, and among participants who spent more time in direct sunlight since high school and resided in areas with higher solar ultraviolet radiation in the US. In conclusion, we found that consumption of grapefruit and orange juice was positively associated with risk of malignant melanoma among US women and men.",Excluded,0.90038866

Design(s): Retrospective case review. Method(s): A review was conducted of 35 patients who received stereotactic three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for optic nerve sheath meningioma from 1990 to 2005. Result(s): Four patients with radiographic confirmation of optic nerve sheath meningioma were identified who had neuro-ophthalmologic assessment, which included perimetry, either while radiation treatment was underway or immediately afterwards. All of the patients showed improvement in visual acuity and visual fields. Conclusion(s): A rapid response to radiation therapy may occur in some patients with optic nerve sheath meningioma. In such patients, it may be possible to customize the radiation dose by assessing of visual function during the course of therapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.8989582
1026,"Sexual Function, Quality of Life, and Mood After Radiation Therapy in Patients with Anal Cancer PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Definitive chemoradiation (CRT) results in high cure rates of anal cancer, with advanced radiation (RT) techniques improving toxicity. However, there is limited data regarding these patients' sexual function (SF), quality of life (QOL), and mood. We hypothesized that anal cancer treatment would result in detrimental effects on SF, QOL, and mood., MATERIALS/METHODS: We prospectively surveyed patients with anal cancer treated with definitive CRT. We assessed SF for women with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and for men with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). For all patients, we assessed QOL using EORTC QLQ-C30 and CR29 and mood using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). We reported descriptive statistics for SF, QOL, and mood and used univariate analysis to evaluate predictors of SF for women., RESULTS: Of 50 eligible patients, 84% completed the surveys. Median time from RT until survey was 36 months (1-97 months). Women (n = 34) reported poor SF overall (mean FSFI score = 15, scale 2-36, standard deviation (SD) 10.4). Most women reported poor SF related to satisfaction, desire, orgasm, arousal, pain, and lubrication. Men (n = 8) also had poor overall satisfaction (mean IIEF score = 6.1, scale 2-10, SD 3.6). Men reported poor erectile function and lower satisfaction with intercourse. Mean QLQ-C30 QOL score was 86.5 (SD 16.3). Results from EORTC QLQ-CR-20 demonstrated patients experienced poor sexual interest. Per HADS, 2.5% reported depression and 18% anxiety., CONCLUSION: Patients with anal cancer experience sexual dysfunction after RT, with QOL and mood symptoms similar to patients with other cancers. Our data support the need for ongoing efforts to understand and address issues with SF, QOL, and mood following RT for these patients.",Excluded,0.890507

METHOD(S): The bilateral auricles of New Zealand white rabbits were received surgical trauma and beta-active irradiation(90Sr-90Y), bFGF was then applied to the wound. The efficacy of bFGF on wound healing was compared with the control group. RESULT(S): On the 10th day after the trauma, the mean epithelalized area was (34.17 +/- 0.37) mm2 and the mean number of microvessels/high power field was (10.25 +/- 2.34) in the treated group, whereas both were (26.25 +/- 0.20) mm2 and (4.38 +/- 0.92) respectivety in the control group. There was a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). On the 7th and 14th days after the trauma, the mean epithelialized area in the treated group was significantly different from that of the control group. The measurement by the image cytometry showed that the treated group had a mean nuclear peak area value of (38.28 +/- 7.23) micron 2 and the mean S-stage cell value of (31.28 +/- 10.35)%, and those of the control group were (28.02 +/- 8.13) micron 2 and (20.14 +/- 9.46)% respectively.

1155,"Histopathological examination of spine tumors after treatment with radiosurgery OBJECTIVE Increased survival time after diagnosis of neoplastic disease has resulted in a gradual increase in spine tumor incidence. Radiosurgery is frequently a viable alternative to operative management in a population with severe medical comorbidities. The authors sought to assess the histopathological consequences of radiosurgery in the subset of patients progressing to operative intervention. METHODS Eighteen patients who underwent radiosurgery for spine tumors between 2008 and 2014 subsequently progressed to surgical treatment. A histopathological examination of these cases was performed. Indications for surgery included symptomatic compression fractures, radiographic instability, and symptoms of cord or cauda equina compression. Biopsy samples were obtained from the tumor within the radiosurgical zone in all cases and were permanently fixated. Viable tumor samples were stained for Ki 67. RESULTS Fifteen patients had metastatic lesions and 3 patients had neurofibromas. The mean patient age was 57 years. The operative indication was symptomatic compression in 10 cases (67%). The most frequent metastatic lesions were breast cancer (4 cases), renal cell carcinoma (3), prostate cancer (2), and endometrial cancer (2). In 9 (60%) of the 15 metastatic cases, histological examination of the lesions showed minimal evidence of inflammation. Viable tumor at the margins of the radiosurgery was seen in 9 (60%) of the metastatic cases. Necrosis in the tumor bed was frequent, as was fibrotic bone marrow. Vascular ectasia was seen in 2 of 15 metastatic cases, but sclerosis with ectasia was frequent. No evidence of malignant conversion was seen in the periphery of the lesions in the 3 neurofibroma cases. In 1 case of neurofibroma, the lesion demonstrated some small areas of remnant tumor in the radiosurgical target zone. CONCLUSIONS This case series demonstrates important histopathological characteristics of spinal lesions treated by SRS. Regions with the highest exposure to radiation appear to be densely necrotic and show little evidence of tumor growth, whereas peripheral regions distant from the radiation dosage are more likely to demonstrate viable tumor in malignant and benign neoplasms. Physiological tissue appears to be similarly affected. With additional investigation, a more homogenized field of hypofractionated radiation exposure may allow for tumor obliteration with relative preservation of critical anatomical structures.",Excluded,0.88637626
771,"Salivary and serum proteomics in head and neck carcinomas: Before and after surgery and radiotherapy Several body fluids have been evaluated as new sources for cancer biomarker discovery. In this context, salivary and serum proteomics seem promising diagnostic and predictive tools for head and neck diseases. In the present study, we performed a proteomic analysis of saliva and serum from patients presenting head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and compared the results before and after therapy. In saliva of cancer patients, we observed an altered protein profile, including over-expression of PLUNC and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein. Both proteins may contribute to control tumor growth and, therefore, represent targets for new analysis. We also detected serotransferrin and a modified transthyretin form with altered levels in serum from patients. Comparing preoperative and postreatment samples, the results showed that the protein profile after treatment reverted to a pattern closer to those observed for controls. These results add information on the role of secreted proteins in the cancer process and emphasize the potential of saliva and serum analysis for diagnosis and monitoring of HNSCC. © 2010/2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

142,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for recurrent surgically treated acromegaly: comparison with fractionated radiotherapy OBJECT: The authors tested the assumption that gamma knife radiosurgery is more effective than fractionated radiotherapy for the treatment of patients with acromegaly who have undergone unsuccessful resective surgery. Untreated and uncured acromegaly causes illness and death. Acromegalic patients in whom growth hormone and, particularly, insulin-like growth factor I are not normalized must undergo further treatment., METHODS: After unsuccessful operations, 16 patients suffering from recurrent and uncured acromegaly underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (25 Gy to the tumor margin, 50 Gy maximum), the outcome of which was compared with the result obtained in 50 patients who received fractionated radiotherapy (40 Gy). The cumulative distribution functions of the two groups (Kaplan-Meier estimate) differed significantly (p < 0.0001 in the log-rank test of Mantel). The mean time to simultaneous normalization of both parameters was 1.4 years in the group treated with the gamma knife and 7.1 years in the group treated with fractionated radiotherapy., CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest the use of stereotactic radiosurgery as the preferred treatment for recurrent acromegaly resulting from unsuccessfully resected tumors.",Excluded,0.8827425

Visual acuity, complication data, and recurrence rates were recorded up to 120 months after brachytherapy., RESULTS: Median age at presentation was 63.0 years (range, 22-93). Median follow-up was 65.5 months (range, 2-180). Median radiation dose at the prescription point was 85.8 Gy (range, 51.8-103.7). Preservation of useful visual acuity, defined as better than 20/200, was noted in 43 of 74 (58%) of patients in the present study at 36 months compared with 50.1% of Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study participants. By 120 months, 17 of 30 (57%; 95% confidence interval, 45-69%) progressed to visual acuity worse than 20/200, whereas 9 of 30 (30%) retained visual acuity of 20/40 or better, and 4 of 30 (13%) were 20/50-20/200. The rate of retinopathy after radiation was approximately 40% of all those observed by 60 months. Baseline visual acuity, apical tumor height, American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor category, and distance between the tumor and the fovea were all significantly associated with loss of visual acuity. The local tumor control rate by 60 months of follow-up was 93% (95% confidence interval, 85-97%)., CONCLUSIONS: The OSU-Nag custom (125)I plaque is an effective treatment for uveal melanoma, with preservation of useful visual acuity in 58% of eyes 3 years after treatment and 43% of eyes 10 years after treatment.

Additionally they reported their examinations of the gastrointestinuum and their use of gastroprotective medication (PPI). Several sociodemographic parameters and some more medical parameters were observed. Treatment group (n = 49) and control group (n = 51) had about 6 in-patient rehabilitation treatments within the period of 12 years, in the treatment group additionally radon mine inhalation therapy was given. Compared to the beginning of the study consumption of NSAIDS after 12 years was only reduced in the treatment group (p < 0,05). Severe complications of the gastrointestinuum followed by in patient treatment were reported by 18 % of the control group and 5% of the treatment group. Bleeding complications only occurred in the control group. So regularly repeated radon mine inhalation therapy seems to lead to a reduced consumption of NSAIDS and a reduced rate of side effect complications for patients with ankylosing spondylitis.",Excluded,0.8812497
942,"Role of Angiogenesis in Chronic Radiation Proctitis: New Evidence Favoring Inhibition of Angiogenesis Ex Vivo Background: Chronic radiation proctitis (CRP), a common complication after radiotherapy for pelvic malignancies, compromises patient quality of life. Vascular damage and aberrant angiogenesis in the mucosal layer are essential histological features, but changes to the submucosal layer are unclear. Thus, we evaluated the histological characteristics and distribution changes of key angiogenic factors in full-layered human CRP samples. Method(s): Thirty paraffin-embedded CRP and twenty-nine non-CRP tissues were used to evaluate histopathological changes. Immunohistochemistry with anti-CD34 antibody was performed to calculate microvascular density (MVD). Frozen tissues from eight CRP patients and five non-CRP controls were collected and analyzed by antibody array, which contained sixty human angiogenesis-related factors. Quality controls with positive and negative controls were performed during antibody array analysis. Two differentially expressed factors were confirmed by ELISA. Result(s): CRP lesions showed vasculopathy, fibrosis, mucosal ulceration, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Human angiogenesis antibody array and ELISA confirmed the increased angiostatin in CRP lesions. Immunohistochemical staining showed dispersed distribution of angiostatin throughout the mucosal and submucosal layers in CRP lesions, while angiostatin accumulated within the vessel lumens in non-CRP tissues. MVD significantly decreased in the submucosal layer of CRP, suggesting a potential association with increased angiostatin. Conclusion(s): Angiostatin increased and had a distinct distribution in CRP lesions. Compensatory telangiectasia in the mucosa, vessel stenosis, and reduced MVD might attenuate blood flow in the submucosa and contribute to CRP progression. Restoration of vascular functionality by promoting angiogenesis in the submucosal layer may help alleviate CRP in clinical practice.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded,0.8740505
424,"Knowledge and risk perception among nuclear power plant employees This is a study of knowledge, risk perception, and attitudes among nuclear power plant employees. A total of 236 persons participated, belonging to 10 different professional groups and working at two Swedish power plants. Job-related radiation risks were judged about average as compared to a number of other risks. On the whole, the participants in the study were satisfied with the measures of safety at work, but there were some exceptions to this rule, especially among those hired for temporary jobs through external contractors. The experience of job-related radiation risks was related to the level of knowledge about radiation and its risks: those who knew less experienced larger risks. General level of anxiety did not correlate with risk perception. The latter was accounted for mainly by perceived radiation risks. Job satisfaction was more strongly related to perceived conventional job risks than to nuclear risks. Risk ratings were related to how subjects defined the concept of risk. Those who stressed consequences as part of their risk definition gave higher risk ratings.",Excluded,0.87265825
1055,"YWHAZ amplification/overexpression defines aggressive bladder cancer and contributes to chemo-/radio-resistance by suppressing caspase-mediated apoptosis The objective of this study was to characterize the oncogenic actions of a recently identified cancer-associated gene YWHAZ (also named as 14-3-3 zeta/delta) in urothelial carcinomas of the urinary bladder (UCUB). A genome-wide study revealed YWHAZ to be involved in the amplicon at 8q22.3, and its genetic amplification was detected predominantly in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the association of YWHAZ overexpression with higher tumor stages, lymph node/vascular invasion, and mitotic activity. Univariate and multivariate analyses further indicated the prognostic potential of YWHAZ for more aggressive cancer types. Both gene set enrichment analysis and STRING network studies suggested involvement of YWHAZ in regulating caspase-mediated apoptosis. Ectopic expression of YWHAZ in bladder cells with low endogenous YWHAZ levels boosted cell resistance to doxorubicin and cisplatin, as well as to ionizing radiation. Conversely, YWHAZ-knockdown using specific shRNA in cells with high endogenous YWHAZ levels diminished survival activity, suppressing cell growth and increasing cell death. Our findings confirm the essential role played by YWHAZ in sustaining cell proliferation during chemo/radiotherapy. Treatments based on anti-YWHAZ strategies may thus be beneficial for UCUB patients overexpressing YWHAZ. © 2019 The Authors.

Minimal lumen diameters and lengths were measured for (1) stent, (2) peri-stent subsegments subjected to angioplasty with/without irradiation, and (3) irradiation margins. GM was defined as: (Type 1) edge injury within the 32P source dose fall-off: 2.0 mm inside and outside the source end marker or (Type 2) overt, nonirradiated injury: beyond the outer 2.0-mm long dose fall-off zone., RESULTS: Restenosis rate was 28.3% at 8.9+/-4.5 months with 60% located exclusively outside the stent. Type 1 GM was present in 24.7% of proximal edges, whereas Type 2 in 18.1%. Respective percentages for distal edges were 23.5% and 15.7%. Regardless of presence and type of GM, significant late lumen loss occurred only outside the stent. However, the biggest late lumen loss at the proximal edge was induced by the Type 1 GM (0.65+/-0.79, p<0.001), while proximal Type 2 GM was not associated with edge renarrowing (-0.04+/-0.48, p=NS).

The Israeli data include 30526 hospital deaths, two groups of fatal suicides (2359, 2763), and 15435 suicidal attempts for two periods of 108 and 236 consecutive months. The national data for the entire Republic of Lithuania include 424925 deaths for the period of 120 consecutive months. Cosmic rays intensity was measured by an Apatity neutron monitor. We obtained the data on solar, geomagnetic radiovawe propagation, ionosphere ionization hours, proton flux of two energy levels (>90 and 60 MeV) from the National Geophysical Data Center at Goddard Space Flight Center, National Space Environment Center at Boulder, Colorado, USA, and from the Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation (IZMIRAN), Russia. We calculated Pearson coefficients and their probabilities for correlation between monthly space activity level and monthly number of male and female deaths from different causes. Cosmic rays activity revealed significant negative correlation with solar/geomagnetic activity indices and related physical phenomena levels. This activity strongly correlated with flux of protons with the energies >90 MeV proton flux and did not exhibit significant correlation with 60 MeV proton fluxes.

Clinical and pharmacologic data] 20 patients with highly dosed irradiation of the small pelvis had been treated with Colifoam (hydrocortisone) in order to prove the therapeutic effect of radiation-induced proctitis. Over a period of three to six weeks starting in the third week of irradiation all patients received one applicator filling of rectal foam after bowel movement daily. The findings were verified by proctoscopy, histology and subjective personal well being. In ten patients we determined the daily cortisol profiles. Six months post irradiation ten patients underwent barium enema of the colon. During therapy no major complaints were recorded. The proctoscopic findings showed little changes concerning the submucous vascular walls. In none of the patients any kind of late lesion could be observed. The daily cortisol profile did not show any aberration of the physiological patterns.

915,"TRAIL enhances efficacy of radiotherapy in a p53 mutant, Bcl-2 overexpressing lymphoid malignancy Background and purpose: Resistance to apoptosis is a contributing factor in the response to radiotherapy. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether TRAIL - in a soluble isoleucine zippered form - enhances the cytotoxic effect of irradiation on tumour cells with a blockade in the mitochondrial apoptosis route and/or a dysfunctional p53 pathway. Material(s) and Method(s): The p53 mutant human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia line Jurkat transduced with the Bcl-2 gene was used as model system in vitro and in a subcutaneous transplant setting in immunodeficient mice. Sensitivity to single and combined treatment was read out by apoptosis hallmarks and clonogenic survival in vitro, and by bioluminescence and palpation in vivo. Result(s): Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 did not undergo apoptosis after irradiation, but the combination with TRAIL synergistically induced apoptosis without breaking mitochondrial resistance. TRAIL also reduced clonogenic survival after irradiation. In vivo, radiotherapy or TRAIL alone delayed tumour outgrowth, but combination treatment had the most profound effect. Conclusion(s): Isoleucine zippered TRAIL can strongly enhance the efficacy of tumour therapy with ionising radiation in an unfavourable setting of p53 mutation and Bcl-2 overexpression. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Totally, 120 patients with locally advanced lung cancer in radiotherapy were randomized into treatment and control groups. Patients in the treatment group took ambroxol orally at a dosage of 90 mg, three times per day for 3 months from the beginning of radiotherapy. The expression of TGF-beta1 and TNF-alpha in plasma was analyzed. The clinical symptoms and lung diffusing capacity were monitored using high resolving power computed tomography. The level of TGF-beta1 in the control group was increased (11.8 +/- 5.5 ng/ml), whereas in ambroxol-treated patients, the increase was not significant (5.6 +/- 2.6 ng/ml, P < 0.001). Radiotherapy-induced elevation of TNF-alpha levels, seen in control patients, was also abolished after treatment with ambroxol (5.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.8 ng/ml, P < 0.001). In the treatment group, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity was not significantly decreased at 6, 12, and 18 months post-radiotherapy, compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Ambroxol decreased the expression of TGF-beta1 and TNF-alpha, and minimized the diminishment of lung diffusion capacity after radiotherapy. © 2009 Humana Press Inc.",Excluded,0.8482391
756,"Adjuvant radiotherapy for margin-positive high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity Purpose: Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) has been shown to improve local control in patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities (STS). The specific impact of adjuvant radiation on patients with positive margins, however, has not been clearly defined. The purpose of this study was to determine if adjuvant RT improves local control in patients with high-grade STS who had positive margins of resection. Methods and Materials: Between 8/82 and 2/97, 110 adult patients with primary high-grade STS of an extremity underwent limb sparing surgery and were found to have a histologically positive microscopic surgical margin. Ninety-one (83%) received RT and 19 (17%) had no RT. The two groups were balanced with regard to size, site, location, and tumor depth. Adjuvant RT was delivered with brachytherapy (BRT) alone in 34 patients, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) alone in 33 patients, or BRT+EBRT in 24 patients. The BRT dose was 45 Gy when used alone and 15-20 Gy when used as a boost. The EBRT dose was 60-70 Gy when used alone and 45-50 Gy when given with BRT. The median follow-up time was 41 months (range, 3-186 months). Result(s): The overall 5 year local control rate was 71%. This rate was significantly higher in the RT group compared to the no RT group (74% vs. 56%, respectively) (p = 0.01). On univariate analysis, lower extremity site and proximal location were also found to be predictors of improved local control (p = 0.03 and 0.03, respectively). However, only proximal location and the use of RT retained their significance as predictors of improved local control on multivariate analysis (p = 0.003 and 0.01, respectively). The overall 5-year distant relapse-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 54%, 44%, and 53%, respectively. No statistical differences were found in these survival rates between RT and no RT groups. Conclusion(s): Based on this study, adjuvant radiotherapy seems to improve local control in patients with high-grade STS of the extremity with positive margins. However, local recurrence still occurs in a substantial proportion of patients, mandating further need for improvement. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded,0.84711117
331,"Combination Therapy with Radiation and PARP Inhibition Enhances Responsiveness to Anti-PD-1 Therapy in Colorectal Tumor Models PURPOSE: The majority of colorectal cancers are resistant to cancer immune checkpoint inhibitors. Ionizing radiation (IR) and several radiosensitizers, including PARP inhibitors, can enhance responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors by potentially complementary mechanisms of action. We assessed the ability of radiation and PARP inhibition to induce proimmunogenic changes in tumor cells and enhance their in vivo responsiveness to anti-PD-1 antibodies., METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a candidate drug screen and used flow cytometry to assess effects of the PARP inhibitor veliparib on IR-mediated changes in MHC-1 antigen presentation and surface localization of immune-modulating proteins including PD-L1 and calreticulin in colorectal cancer tumor models. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the effects of veliparib and radiation on the expression of proinflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines. The ability of concurrent PARP inhibition and subablative doses of radiation therapy to enhance in vivo responsiveness to anti-PD-1 antibodies was assessed using unilateral flank-tumor models with or without T-cell depletion., RESULTS: Veliparib was a potent radiosensitizer in both cell lines. Radiation increased surface localization of MHC-1 and PD-L1 in a dose-dependent manner, and veliparib pretreatment significantly enhanced these effects with high (8 Gy) but not with lower radiation doses. Enhancement of MHC-1 and PD-L1 surface localization by IR and IR+ veliparib remained significant 1, 3, and 7 days after treatment. IR significantly increased delayed tumoral expression of proinflammatory cytokines interferon-Y and CXCL10 but had no significant effect on the expression of IL-6 or TGF-beta. Concurrent administration of veliparib and subablative radiation therapy (8 Gy x 2) significantly prolonged anti-PD-1-mediated in vivo tumor growth delay and survival in both tumor models. Moreover, these effects were more pronounced in the microsatellite instability-mutated MC38 tumor model. Enhancement of anti-PD-1 mediated tumor growth delay with veliparib and IR was attenuated by CD8+ T-cell depletion., CONCLUSIONS: We provide preclinical evidence for a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance responsiveness of colorectal tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

338,"Radiation exposure among patients with the highest CT scan utilization in the emergency department The risk of cancer from computed tomography (CT) scan radiation is a rising concern in the medical field. Our objectives were to determine how many patients received more than ten CT scans in an academic emergency department (ED) over the course of 7 years and to quantify their radiation exposure and lifetime attributable risk of cancer. An electronic chart review was performed at our urban academic institution with an annual census of 110,000 patients. All patients who underwent a CT scan performed during ED management between the dates of January 2001 and December 2007 were identified. Specific predetermined data elements (e.g., subject demographics, type of CT scan) were extracted by two researchers blinded to hypothesis, using a preformatted data form. After identifying patients with more than ten CTs performed during the study period, radiation exposure was calculated based on accepted and reported radiation doses for the respective anatomic CTs, and lifetime attributable cancer risk was calculated based on the seventh report of the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR VII) projections. Over the 7-year study period, 24,393 patients received 34,671 CT scans. The vast majority of patients (17,909) received a single CT. Twenty-six (0.1 %) patients received more than ten CTs totaling 374 scans with an average radiation exposure of 83.4 mSv. The maximum lifetime attributable risk for any individual in this cohort was 1.7 % above the baseline cancer risk. Among those undergoing CT imaging in our ED, high-exposure patients (greater than ten scans) constituted a significant minority, while more than one in four patients underwent more than one CT scan during the study period. While the presumed overall risk of radiation-induced cancer continues to be low, it is important for the emergency physician to use clinical knowledge as well as concern for the patient when utilizing radiographic imaging. Increasing attributable cancer risk may have important public health implications in the future, regardless of the low individual risk.",Excluded,0.83481324

79,"Advanced multimodal nanoparticles delay tumor progression with clinical radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a major treatment regimen for more than 50% of cancer patients. The collateral damage induced on healthy tissues during radiation and the minimal therapeutic effect on the organ-of-interest (target) is a major clinical concern. Ultra-small, renal clearable, silica based gadolinium chelated nanoparticles (SiGdNP) provide simultaneous MR contrast and radiation dose enhancement. The high atomic number of gadolinium provides a large photoelectric cross-section for increased photon interaction, even for high-energy clinical radiation beams. Imaging and therapy functionality of SiGdNP were tested in cynomolgus monkeys and pancreatic tumor-bearing mice models, respectively. A significant improvement in tumor cell damage (double strand DNA breaks), growth suppression, and overall survival under clinical radiation therapy conditions were observed in a human pancreatic xenograft model. For the first time, safe systemic administration and systematic renal clearance was demonstrated in both tested species. These findings strongly support the translational potential of SiGdNP for MR-guided radiation therapy in cancer treatment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.8229403

However, for earlobe keloids, an optimal protocol for the total dose and fractions of adjuvant radiation has not yet been established. We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of immediate three-fraction electron radiotherapy after operation for resistant earlobe keloids. From 2011 to 2017, three-fraction electron radiotherapy with single dose of 5 Gy was given postoperatively to 23 patients with 30 keloids in our hospital. The first fraction of adjuvant radiotherapy was administered within 2 h of surgery, and the other two sessions were completed within the next day or two. Five (16.7%) primary keloids and 25 (83.3%) recurrent keloids were examined in this study. The primary endpoint was the local control rate, which was 86.7% after a median follow-up of 26 months (14-93 months). Secondary endpoints were acute and late procedure-related complications, and no severe complications were observed after combination therapy. Our results suggest that three-fraction electron radiotherapy after excision within 2 days of surgery is a safe and effective protocol for the prevention of earlobe keloid recurrence that can also improve patient compliance and comfort.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.81325877
380,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for pituitary adenoma invading the cavernous sinus Object. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) treatment of pituitary adenomas that have invaded the cavernous sinus. Methods. Sixteen patients were treated with GKS: three with nonfunctional adenomas and 13 with hormone-secreting (seven growth hormone [GH] and six adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) adenomas. More than 16 Gy and 30 Gy were delivered to the tumor margin for nonfunctioning tumors and functioning tumors, respectively, keeping the dose to the optic pathways below 10 Gy. The median follow up was 3 years. Tumor growth control was achieved in all cases. In GH-producing tumors, four of six cases evaluated were endocrinologically normalized (serum GH < 10 mIU/L, somatomedin C < 450 ng/ml), and the remaining two cases also showed a steady decrease in the GH and somatomedin level. In ACTH-producing tumors, three of six cases were endocrinologically normalized (24-hour urinary-free cortisol < 90 mg/day), two were unchanged, and one showed hormonal recurrence 3 years after radiosurgery. Notably, there were no cases of permanent hypopituitarism or visual symptoms caused by radiosurgery. Conclusions. The authors data indicate that GKS can be a safe salvage therapy for invading pituitary adenomas, with effectiveness equivalent to conventional radiation therapy but with less risk of causing radiation-induced injury to the surrounding structures.",Excluded,0.81315297
606,"Patterns of Care Study of radiation therapy for esophageal cancer in Japan: Influence of age on parameters of treatment Background. In Japan, the elderly population is growing rapidly, and therefore, so is the number of cancer patients who are not good candidates for aggressive surgery or chemotherapy. Radiation therapy offers excellent potential for the treatment of such patients, with minimal invasion and functional preservation. A Patterns of Care Study (PCS) examined the parameters of treatments used for patients with esophageal cancer to determine nationwide variations by age. Methods. From July 1996 through February 1997, external nationwide PCS audits were performed for 29 institutions. Medical charts were reviewed for 455 patients with thoracic esophageal cancer treated between 1992 and 1994. The parameters of treatments used for these patients were compared between those aged >=75 years (elderly; n = 113) and those aged <75 years (younger; n = 342). Results. Surgery was used in 49% of the younger group and in 17% of the elderly group (P < 0.0001) while chemotherapy was used in 48% of the younger and 24% of the older group (P < 0.0001). The ratio of non-surgery group with radiation therapy increased significantly from 49% to 82% (P < 0.0001). Approximately 70% of the non- surgery patients received an external radiation dose of more than 60 Gy, even in the elderly (P = 0.3001). Preliminary results showed no significant difference in survival between the two age groups (P = 0.5559). Conclusions. The use of radiation therapy in elderly people with esophageal cancer has increased markedly. The PCS provided important information about variations in radiotherapy parameters in patients with esophageal cancer in relation to age. Such information should be useful for future prospective studies of the elderly.",Excluded,0.8052273
559,"Trends in the incidence of sudden deaths and heart diseases in fukushima after the great east Japan earthquake On March 11, 2011, a great earthquake, known as the Great East Japan Earthquake, hit northeastern Japan, resulting in a tsunami that caused a nuclear disaster, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, forcing about 160,000 people to evacuate. We, therefore, sought to examine the effects of this evacuation on the onset of cardiovascular diseases and sudden death (SD) in Fukushima Prefecture, three years after the earthquake. We divided the evacuation zone into two areas, whole evacuation zone (Area 1) and partial evacuation zone (Area 2), and we defined the north district of the prefecture as the control area (Area 3). We cross-referenced the death certificate data with data from the Fukushima Prefecture acute myocardial infarction registration survey. For each area, we tallied the number of people who fell into the SD, myocardial infarction (MI), and MI suspected groups. We calculated the age-adjusted incidence rates and analyzed the differences in the adjusted incidence rates across three years using a Poisson regression model. The age-adjusted death rate of the SD group was significantly higher in 2011 in all areas than in 2012 or 2013 (P < 0.05). The total death rate was higher in Area 1 in March 2011, just after the disaster, than in the other two areas. The rate of SD was also higher in Area 1 than in the other areas in March 2011. The incidence of sudden cardiac death might have increased just after the Great East Japan Earthquake in the evacuation area, but not in other areas in Fukushima Prefecture.Copyright © 2019, International Heart Journal Association.

1014,"Potential Functional Variants in DNA Repair Genes Are Associated with Efficacy and Toxicity of Radiotherapy in Patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Background. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Radiotherapy, either alone or with chemotherapy, is still the primary treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are variations in how patients with NSCLC respond to radiotherapy and how toxic the therapy is. DNA repair gene polymorphisms are related to cancer development; however, their association with radiotherapy outcomes remains unknown. We hypothesized that gDNA repair gene variation could affect the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Methods. A total of 486 histologically confirmed patients with NSCLC were recruited from the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from July 2015 to September 2019. Eleven potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four DNA repair genes (XRCC1, XRCC2, XPD, and MSH2) were genotyped in these patients. A multiple factor logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between these SNPs and the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy. Results. Three SNPs, rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD), were all significantly associated with the efficacy of radiotherapy. The allele frequencies of the rs25487 CC genotype (OR = 0.457, 95% CI = 0.259-0.804, p=0.006) and the rs3218556 AG or AA genotypes (AG genotype: OR = 0.664, 95% CI = 0.442-0.999, p=0.049; AA genotype: OR = 0.380, 95% CI = 0.181-0.795, p=0.008) were both significantly higher in the response group than in the nonresponse group. For rs13181, the radiotherapy efficacy was associated with the heterozygous genotype GT (OR = 1.663, 95% CI = 1.057-2.614,p=0.027). Statistically significant associations between radiation-induced toxic reactions and rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) were also observed. The rs13181GT genotype was associated with lower toxic reactions than the TT genotype (OR = 1.680, 95% CI = 1.035-2.728,p=0.035). Conclusions. The variants rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) all contribute to the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Our findings may clarify the predictive value of DNA repair genes for prognosis in patients with NSCLC after radiotherapy. Further investigation of more genes and samples should be performed to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2020 Zhiguang Yang and Zhaoyu Liu.",Excluded,0.79440403

TaqMan Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) was used to verify the SNPs of LIG4 and HSPB1 genes. Chi-square criterion was used to compare the differences in demographic characteristics, exposure to risk factors, and SNPs genotypes. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated by logistic regression analysis. All statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS 18.0., RESULTS: A total of 32 (20.0%) lung cancer patients had RP after receiving radiotherapy. Of the 32 cases, 4 cases were of grade 2, 24 cases were of grade 3, and 4 cases were of grade 4. However, our results indicated that the general condition and treatment of all patients had no significant difference with RP risk (P > 0.05). Meanwhile, our results revealed that there was no significant association between the frequencies of LIG4 rs1805388 and HSPB1 rs2868371 genotype distribution and the risk of RP (P > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we demonstrated that the genetic polymorphisms in LIG4 rs1805388 and HSPB1 rs2868371 were not obviously correlated with the risk of RP and RILI of lung cancer.",Excluded,0.7936265

After successful PTA, a segmented centering balloon catheter was positioned to cover the PTA site. The patients were then transported to the radiation oncology suite and treated with a microSelectron HDR afterloader with use of an Ir-192 source with a prescribed dose of 14 Gy, 2 mm into the vessel wall. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) and Rutherford score were evaluated at 1, 6, and 12 months after the procedure and angiographic follow-up was conducted at 6 months., RESULTS: Radiation was delivered successfully to 35 of 40 patients. There were no procedural complications. Exercise and rest ABI were higher at 1 year (0.72 +/- 0.26 and 0.89 +/- 0.18, respectively) compared to baseline (0.51 +/- 0.25 and 0.67 +/- 0.17, respectively). Maximum walking time on a treadmill increased from 3.41 min +/- 2.41 to 4.43 min +/- 2.49 at 30 days and was 4.04 min +/- 2.8 at 12 months. The angiographic binary restenosis rate at 6 months was 17.2% and the clinical restenosis rate at 12 months was 13.3%. There were no angiographic or clinical adverse events related to the radiation therapy., CONCLUSIONS: Intraarterial radiation after PTA of SFA lesions with use of high-dose rate gamma radiation is feasible and safe.

The purpose of this study was to compare and contrast the clinical and sialographic imaging features of 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis to 131I radiation-induced parotitis. Patients and Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study included patients with 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis. Clinical records and sialographic image features were evaluated. The predictor variables included age at the time of diagnosis, gender, course of the disease, site of symptoms, and sialographic image grades. The outcome variable was the location of sialadenitis. A student t-test was conducted to analyze the associations between predictor variables and the outcome. Result(s): The sample was composed of 4 patients with submandibular gland sialadenitis (100% female), 28 with parotitis (85.7% female), and 1 with submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis (P <.05). The occurrence of bilateral glands dysfunction was less often in submandibular glands (SMG: 1/4; PG: 19/28). The age and course of disease were not different between submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis (Age, SMG: 46.00 +/- 13.59 years; PG: 50.04 +/- 10.71 years, P >.05; Course of the disease, SMG: 11.00 +/- 16.69 months; PG: 6.96 +/- 11.18 months, P >.05). Radiographically, 7 of 16 patients with parotitis were identified as grade 2 and 9 patients as grade 3. In 3 patients with submandibular gland sialadenitis, 1 patient was identified as grade 2 and 2 patients as grade 3. The postoperative pathological results showed that the proliferation of glandular tissue from the hilum of the submandibular gland caused duct stenosis. Conclusion(s): The results suggest 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis has a lower incidence compared with parotitis and 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis might be related to duct stenosis caused by proliferative glandular tissue after 131I radiation treatment.Copyright © 2020 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons",Excluded,0.74131703

964,"PHD3-dependent hydroxylation of HCLK2 promotes the DNA damage response The DNA damage response (DDR) is a complex regulatory network that is critical for maintaining genome integrity. Posttranslational modifications are widely used to ensure strict spatiotemporal control of signal flow, but how the DDR responds to environmental cues, such as changes in ambient oxygen tension, remains poorly understood. We found that an essential component of the ATR/CHK1 signaling pathway, the human homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans biological clock protein CLK-2 (HCLK2), associated with and was hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 3 (PHD3). HCLK2 hydroxylation was necessary for its interaction with ATR and the subsequent activation of ATR/CHK1/p53. Inhibiting PHD3, either with the pan-hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) or through hypoxia, prevented activation of the ATR/CHK1/p53 pathway and decreased apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Consistent with these observations, we found that mice lacking PHD3 were resistant to the effects of ionizing radiation and had decreased thymic apoptosis, a biomarker of genomic integrity. Our identification of HCLK2 as a substrate of PHD3 reveals the mechanism through which hypoxia inhibits the DDR, suggesting hydroxylation of HCLK2 is a potential therapeutic target for regulating the ATR/CHK1/p53 pathway.",Excluded,0.7346357
1065,"DNA double strand breaks but not interstrand crosslinks prevent progress through meiosis in fully grown mouse oocytes There is some interest in how mammalian oocytes respond to different types of DNA damage because of the increasing expectation of fertility preservation in women undergoing chemotherapy. Double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation and agents such as neocarzinostatin (NCS), and interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by alkylating agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), are toxic DNA lesions that need to be repaired for cell survival. Here we examined the effects of NCS and MMC treatment on oocytes collected from antral follicles in mice, because potentially such oocytes are readily collected from ovaries and do not need to be in vitro grown to achieve meiotic competency. We found that oocytes were sensitive to NCS, such that this ionizing radiation mimetic blocked meiosis I and caused fragmented DNA. In contrast, MMC had no impact on the completion of either meiosis I or II, even at extremely high doses. However, oocytes treated with MMC did show gamma-H2AX foci and following their in vitro maturation and parthenogenetic activation the development of the subsequent embryos was severely compromised. Addition of MMC to 1-cell embryos caused a similarly poor level of development, demonstrating oocytes have eventual sensitivity to this ICL-inducing agent but this does not occur during their meiotic division. In oocytes, the association of Fanconi Anemia protein, FANCD2, with sites of ICL lesions was not apparent until entry into the embryonic cell cycle. In conclusion, meiotic maturation of oocytes is sensitive to DSBs but not ICLs. The ability of oocytes to tolerate severe ICL damage and yet complete meiosis, means that this type of DNA lesion goes unrepaired in oocytes but impacts on subsequent embryo quality.",Excluded,0.7071758

Ninety-seven percent of tumors progress, and 5-year surgery rates are 20%-60%. Stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated radiotherapy have had limited success. For the first time, we have used infratentorial craniospinal radiation therapy (ICSRT) for VHL patients with CNS hemangioblastomas. Consecutive VHL patients treated at the National Institutes of Health with radiographic evidence of hemangioblastomas were included if they received ICSRT. Patients underwent neurologic examinations and imaging at 3- to 12-month intervals. Seven patients with 84 hemangioblastomas met eligibility criteria. ICSRT was commonly administered to 43.2 Gy in 24 fractions. Mean pre-ICSRT tumor volume was 5.48 cm3. At a mean follow-up of 73.8 months, mean post-ICSRT tumor volume was 6.87 cm3, and 91 tumors were identified. Complete radiographic resolution was achieved in 17.9% of lesions. Although many patients were no longer optimal surgical candidates, only 4 surgeries were needed for symptomatic lesions after ICSRT, compared with 33 prior. Acute toxicity was mild and no patient developed grade >=1 late spinal cord toxicity according to the criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, despite the high dose that the entire spinal cord received. Clinical and radiographic stability or resolution was demonstrated in the majority of tumors. Tumor growth rate in this study was less than reported in natural history studies, and the rate of surgical intervention was reduced.

842,"T95 nucleophosmin phosphorylation as a novel mediator and marker of regulated cell death in acute kidney injury The function of site-specific phosphorylation of nucleophosmin (NPM), an essential Bax chaperone, in stress-induced cell death is unknown. We hypothesized that NPM threonine 95 (T95) phosphorylation both signals and promotes cell death. In resting cells, NPM exclusively resides in the nucleus and T95 is nonphosphorylated. In contrast, phosphorylated T95 NPM (pNPM T95) accumulates in the cytosol after metabolic stress, in multiple human cancer cell lines following gamma-radiation, and in postischemic human kidney tissue. Based on the T95 phosphorylation consensus sequence, we hypothesized that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) regulates cytosolic NPM translocation by phosphorylating T95 NPM. In a cell-free system, GSK-3beta phosphorylated a synthetic NPM peptide containing T95. In vitro, bidirectional manipulation of GSK-3beta activity substantially altered T95 phosphorylation, cytosolic NPM translocation, and cell survival during stress, mechanistically linking these lethal events. Furthermore, GSK-3beta inhibition in vivo decreased cytosolic pNPM T95 accumulation in kidney tissue after experimental ischemia. In patients with acute kidney injury, both cytosolic NPM accumulation in proximal tubule cells and NPM-rich intratubular casts were detected in frozen renal biopsy tissue. These observations show, for the first time, that GSK-3beta promotes cell death partly by phosphorylating NPM at T95, to promote cytosolic NPM accumulation. T95 NPM is also a rational therapeutic target to ameliorate ischemic renal cell injury and may be a universal injury marker in mammalian cells.Copyright © 2020 the American Physiological Society",Excluded,0.664767

Radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to improve local control in several retrospective studies, but outcomes of adjuvant versus salvage RT after a gross total resection (GTR) are not well understood.We reviewed the outcomes of patients treated with RT after GTR and subtotal resection (STR) at our institution, where radiation therapy (RT) has typically been reserved for salvage. Materials/Methods: Between 1997 and 2014, 76 patients with WHO Grade II meningiomas were treated at our institution. One patient with NF2 was excluded from this analysis. Of the 75 remaining patients, 62 underwent GTR (Simpson grade I e III) and 13 STR (Simpson IV-V). No patient with GTR received adjuvant RT. A total of 22 patients received RT: 10 as salvage of recurrence following GTR, 10 as salvage following STR, and 2 adjuvantly, each after biopsy only. Fractionated RT was employed in 18 patients, with doses ranging from 50.4-60 Gy (median 59.4 Gy) in 28-33 fractions, and stereotactic radiosurgery in 4 patients, with a single fraction of 15-18 Gy (median 17 Gy). Result(s): Extent of surgery was significantly predictive of progression-free survival (PFS). Following GTR and STR respectively, 2-year PFS was 75% versus 33%, and 4-year PFS 68% versus 17% (P = 0.0008). Despite a significant improvement in PFS after GTR, patients who recurred following GTR had a poor response to salvage RT, with 6 of the 10 patients continuing to progress despite RT. Conversely, none of the 12 patients who had undergone STR or biopsy experienced progression following RT. Respectively for GTR and STR, PFS following RT was 77% and 100% at 1 year, and 39% and 100% after 2 years (P = 0.04). Radiation dose was not significantly different between patients who progressed (median 56.7 Gy) and those who did not (median 60 Gy) following RT (P = 0.42). Likewise there was no difference in RT dose for those with GTR versus STR (median 60 Gy versus 59.4 Gy respectively, P = 0.94). Conclusion(s): In our patient cohort, salvage RT for recurrence following GTR was associated with a high rate of failure (61% at 2 years), whereas salvage or adjuvant RT following STR was effective, with no failures at 2 years. This data suggests that tumors recurring after GTR are biologically distinct from tumors that progress following STR. While extent of resection is predictive of PFS, the 4-year local failure following GTR alone was still 32%; therefore, adjuvant RT should be considered in this setting. Whether routine adjuvant RT following GTR of Grade II meningioma will significantly reduce subsequent failures remains to be determined. A randomized, prospective comparison of adjuvant RT after GTR is needed to resolve this question.",Excluded,0.6625081
24,"Low-dose ultraviolet exposure early in development can lead to widespread melanoma in the opossum model Suckling young of opossums (Monodelphis domestica) were exposed to ultraviolet radiation (UVR, predominantly UVB: 290-320 nm) in part to determine an optimal protocol for induction and progression of melanoma in this species. In all, 620 litters were introduced to one of seven protocols. The lowest dose (175 J/m2) administered three times a week for almost three weeks led to the highest incidence of melanotic lesions with melanoma potential (8.1%) among young (5-month-old) adults. Among 101 much older animals (> 17 months at necropsy), 43% showed metastatic melanoma to the lymph nodes and almost one-third of these had progressed to widespread dissemination. Three of the latter animals, from a total of 13 obtained so far, were selected for detailed histological examination of disseminated disease. At necropsy, all three showed widespread metastases beyond the lymph nodes to the spleen, lungs, and other distant sites. Histological changes typical of malignant melanoma included junctional activity, mitotic figures, and nerve and vessel invasion. This novel finding leads us to conclude that UVR can act as a complete carcinogen for progression to widely disseminated disease and that exposure of sucklings can lead, in old age, to widespread metastatic melanoma in this model. The results are thus not inconsistent with the view that, in humans, early exposure to sunlight might act as an initiating factor in a later progression to malignant melanoma.",Excluded,0.65572494
718,"Relative Safety of External Beam Radiation Therapy in Lung Transplant Recipients Who Develop Thoracic Malignancies We report outcomes for three patients who previously received lung transplants, subsequently developed malignancies, and were given radiation therapy to the chest for treatment of their cancers despite lack of scientific data on radiation tolerance of transplanted lung. None of three patients exhibited early or delayed adverse reactions to radiotherapy. For these three cases, the mean dose to the ipsilateral transplanted lung was 10 Gy, and ipsilateral lung relative volume of lung receiving 20 Gy or more was, on average, 22%. These doses are relatively low and would have been considered safe for patients with native lungs. In our opinion, tolerance of transplanted lung to therapeutic radiotherapy clearly requires additional research. While those data are pending, radiation therapy to the thorax should not be ruled out on the basis of having a lung transplant alone, provided lung dose can be maintained as low as possible using meticulous treatment planning.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

976,"Involved-site radiotherapy for helicobacter pylori-independent gastric MALT lymphoma: 26 years of experience with 178 patients Treatment options for Helicobacter pylori-independent gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (GML) include surgery, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy (RT). The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of RT and routine endoscopic surveillance, hypothesizing that most patients are curable with RT alone. We queried a single institution database at a tertiary referral cancer center for patients with H pylori-independent GML treated with RT between 1991 and 2017. Response was assessed by follow-up endoscopies (EGDs) starting 10 to 12 weeks post-RT. Computed tomography scans were also part of the follow-up program, and positron emission tomography was added when clinically appropriate. We identified 178 patients (median age, 63 years; range, 25-89 years); 86% had stage I disease, 7% had stage II disease, and 7% had stage IV disease. Median RT dose was 3000 cGy over 20 fractions. Ninety-five percent of patients exhibited complete pathologic response on posttreatment EGD. Two patients experienced grade 3 toxicity, and 2 patients experienced in-field secondary malignancies. Over a median follow-up of 6.2 years, 9.6% experienced local failures, and 11.8% developed distant sites of disease. Five-year and 10-year overall survival were 94% and 79%, respectively, from last date of RT. RT is a highly effective and safe treatment for GML with excellent overall survival and very rare acute or late treatment-related toxicities. Favorable outcomes from this large retrospective sample of patients provide credible and compelling support for RT as standard of care for H pylori-independent GML.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology",Excluded,0.65494215
475,"Anthropometric factors and cutaneous melanoma: Prospective data from the population-based Janus Cohort The aim of the present study was to prospectively examine risk of cutaneous melanoma (CM) according to measured anthropometric factors, adjusted for exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), in a large population-based cohort in Norway. The Janus Cohort, including 292,851 Norwegians recruited 1972-2003, was linked to the Cancer Registry of Norway and followed for CM through 2014. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of CM with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Restricted cubic splines were incorporated into the Cox models to assess possible non-linear relationships. All analyses were adjusted for attained age, indicators of UVR exposure, education, and smoking status. During a mean follow-up of 27 years, 3,000 incident CM cases were identified. In men, CM risk was positively associated with body mass index, body surface area (BSA), height and weight (all ptrends < 0.001), and the exposure-response curves indicated an exponential increase in risk for all anthropometric factors. Weight loss of more than 2 kg in men was associated with a 53% lower risk (HR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.57). In women, CM risk increased with increasing BSA (ptrend = 0.002) and height (ptrend < 0.001). The shape of the height-CM risk curve indicated an exponential increase. Our study suggests that large body size, in general, is a CM risk factor in men, and is the first to report that weight loss may reduce the risk of CM among men.Copyright © 2017 UICC",Excluded,0.6511121
166,"IGF-1R expression predicts clinical outcome in patients with locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma To assess the expression of IGF-1R in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma patients, to explore its relation with clinical and pathologic prognostic factors and its role in predicting clinical outcome. One hundred and thirty-one consecutive patients suffering from oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma were included in this study from July 1989 to April 2005. Follow-up was closed in May 2010. The mean follow-up for survivors was 110.26 +/- 47.42 months. Patients were staged following the TNM classification. Patients in tumour stages I and II were referred to surgery. Patients in stages III-IV were referred to postoperative radiotherapy. Radiation therapy was administered up to a mean dose of 62.13 +/- 7.74 Gy in 1.8-2 Gy fractions. IGF-1R expression was studied by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tumour tissue. IGF-1R was expressed in 101 patients (77.1%). IGF-1R expression was related to tumour grade (P = 0.012). Tumour stage was the most important prognostic factor for survival. Low (negative and fairly) IGF-1R tumour expression was correlated to better long-term Local Disease Free Survival (P = 0.016), Disease-Free Survival (P = 0.029), and Survival (P = 0.009) in patients achieving tumour stages III-IV. Low IGF-1R expression was related to better long-term control in patients suffering locally advanced oral carcinoma. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded,0.6433049
401,"Establishing the European diagnostic reference levels for interventional cardiology Interventional cardiac procedures may be associated with high patient doses and therefore require special attention to protect the patients from radiation injuries such as skin erythema, cardiovascular tissue reactions or radiation-induced cancer. In this study, patient exposure data is collected from 13 countries (37 clinics and nearly 50 interventional rooms) and for 10 different procedures. Dose data was collected from a total of 14,922 interventional cardiology procedures. Based on these data European diagnostic reference levels (DRL) for air kerma-area product are suggested for coronary angiography (CA, DRL = 35 Gy cm2), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, 85 Gy cm2), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI, 130 Gy cm2), electrophysiological procedures (12 Gy cm2) and pacemaker implantations. Pacemaker implantations were further divided into single-chamber (2.5 Gy cm2) and dual chamber (3.5 Gy cm2) procedures and implantations of cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (18 Gy cm2). Results show that relatively new techniques such as TAVI and treatment of chronic total occlusion (CTO) often produce relatively high doses, and thus emphasises the need for use of an optimization tool such as DRL to assist in reducing patient exposure. The generic DRL presented here facilitate comparison of patient exposure in interventional cardiology.Copyright © 2018 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica",Excluded,0.64200616
917,"Retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma: low-dose neoadjuvant radiation therapy followed by surgery with or without intraoperative radiotherapy and adjuvant radiation therapy Background: We describe the clinical history, outcome, and toxicity of five patients with high-grade retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma (RSTS) who were treated with neoadjuvant low-dose radiotherapy (RT) followed by resection with or without intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), followed by adjuvant RT. We aim to provide additional evidence for the various treatment options that exist for this rare tumor entity. Method(s): Most patients presented with mild abdominal symptoms. Diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy. Additional imaging was done by sonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). All patients were treated with neoadjuvant RT of 19.8Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions followed by resection and postoperative RT up to 45Gy with a median interval between resection and start of postoperative RT of 5 weeks. Two patients received additional IORT. Median follow-up was 61 months. Result(s): One patient developed a local recurrence that was diagnosed 30 months after the start of the first therapy. He was treated with a salvage resection and had no evidence of disease at the last follow-up. Another patient developed a right-sided RSTS on the contralateral side from the primary radiation field with pelvic bone infiltration 56 months after the start of RT. He was treated again by RT and resection and was without evidence of disease at last follow-up. Radiotherapy was well tolerated without major toxicity. Conclusion(s): The treatment of RSTS by low-dose neoadjuvant RT, resection with IORT and adjuvant RT seems to be a feasible and effective treatment approach. Further studies comparing neoadjuvant with adjuvant RT are necessary to find the best treatment option.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded,0.61286724
669,"Role of radiation therapy in the treatment of stage I/II mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma Background: Few large studies exist on the outcome of patients treated for stage I/II mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 77 patients consecutively treated for stage I (n = 66) or II (n = 11) MALT lymphoma at our institution. Progression-free survival (PFS), freedom from treatment failure (FFTF), and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-uptime was 61 months (range 2-177 months). Fifty-two patients (68%) received local radiation therapy (RT) alone, 17 (22%) had surgery followed by adjuvant RT, five (6%) had surgery alone, two (3%) had surgery and chemotherapy, and one patient had chemotherapy alone. The median RT dose was 30 Gy (range 18-40 Gy). The 5-year PFS, FFTF, and OS rates were 76%, 78%, and 91%, respectively. The 5-year PFS (79% versus 50%; P = 0.002) and FFTF (81% versus 50%; P = 0.0004) rates were higher for patients who received RT as compared with patients who did not. Conclusion(s): The prognosis following treatment of stage I/II MALT lymphoma is excellent. RT improves PFS and FFTF and has an important role in the curative treatment of patients with localized disease. © 2007 Oxford University Press.",Excluded,0.5949631
440,"Radon testing in rapid access lung clinics: an opportunity for secondary prevention Background: Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas and a level 1 carcinogen. It acts synergistically with cigarette smoke to cause lung cancer. In Ireland, radon is estimated to be associated with 13 % of all lung cancers. Rapid access lung cancer clinics (RALC's) were established in the UK and Ireland to improve lung cancer management outcomes. There has been no attempt to date to provide advice on household radon exposure assessments in this setting. Aim(s): We performed a prospective feasibility study of radon assessment in our RALC to test the hypothesis that patients would avail of this service and that it would provide an opportunity for secondary prevention in at risk persons. Method(s): We investigated household radon levels in consecutive patients who were newly referred with symptoms of lung cancer to the RALC in Galway University Hospital, Ireland over a 6-month period. Result(s): Of 50 patients enrolled, 42 returned valid results. Overall 21 % of patients had radon levels recorded above the national reference level. Only 5 % of patients were aware of the association between radon gas and lung cancer. Smokers were significantly less likely to engage fully in radon testing. Conclusion(s): The development of RALC's offers a novel opportunity to integrate the concepts of radon exposure, cigarette smoking and the development of lung cancer, and to reinforce this message in the minds of at risk patients.Copyright © 2016, Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.",Excluded,0.5749831

In the Ames test for mutagenicity, 2-F-A-85380 was without effect in five bacterial strains. No evidence of gross pathology or histopathological changes occurred in either 2-day acute (0.4-4000 nmol/kg i.v.) or 14-day expanded acute (40-4000 nmol/kg i.v.) toxicity studies in mice. Similarly, hematology and serum chemistry values in rhesus monkeys administered 60 nmol/kg i.v. were not affected over 14 days. Like nicotine, 2-F-A-85380 produced convulsions in mice at very high doses. The ED(50) value of 2-F-A-85380 for eliciting tonic-clonic convulsions (5.0 micromol/kg i.v.) was nearly 4 times greater than that of nicotine (ED(50) = 1.4 micromol/kg i.v.). Lower doses of 2-F-A-85380 (30-300 nmol/kg i.v.) and nicotine (20-400 nmol/kg i.v.) increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac contractility in rats. Notably, the PR, QRS, or QTc intervals of the rat electrocardiogram were unaffected by either drug. Dosimetry studies indicated that the urinary bladder wall was the critical organ and total radiation exposure was within acceptable limits. Estimated doses of 2-F-A-85380 required to elevate blood pressure and heart rate by 10% ranged from 40 to 58 nmol/kg i.v. Nevertheless, the estimated radiopharmaceutically relevant dose of [(18)F]2-F-A-8380 required for initial PET imaging studies, 10 pmol/kg, is less than 1/4000th of the doses calculated (40-58 nmol/kg i.v.) to elevate blood pressure and heart rate by 10% in humans and should elicit no clinically significant effects and have acceptable dosimetry.",Excluded,0.57076615

This paper aims to fill this gap with reference to the recovery process in Fukushima City following the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami in Japan., METHODS: Open access data were sourced from the 2015 Social Survey on Living and Disaster Recovery (SSLDR) (N = 1439) of Fukushima citizens. Pearson's Chi-square Test and the t-test were employed to examine gender differences with regard to happiness and exploratory variables. Following this, a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the determinants of happiness., RESULTS: The results showed that, compared to females, male respondents were unhappier and reported more property loss and less neighborhood connectedness. Individuals' mental and physical health and neighborhood connectedness were found to be significantly correlated with their happiness. However, the disaster-related variables of people's evaluation of recovery achievement, concerns around the health impacts of radiation, property loss in the disaster, and experiences of casualty, had no effects on happiness., CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that policies and countermeasures dealing with disaster recovery over the long term should continuously focus on health issues and social relationships.",Excluded,0.5374218
96,"Incidental gonadal radiation exposure in the prophylactic treatment of heterotopic ossification Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy is commonly used for heterotopic ossification (HO) prophylaxis after the orthopedic repair of fractures involving the hip and femur. Given the young age of many of these patients presenting for treatment and the proximity of the reproductive organs to tissue requiring radiation therapy, incidental radiation exposure to the gonads must be considered for potential fertility issues. The purpose of this study was to report dosimetric gonadal exposure among a large cohort of patients who underwent 3-dimensional simulation and radiation therapy for HO prophylaxis. Materials/Methods: A total of 45 patients (38 males; 7 females) were identified that underwent volumetric CT-planned radiation therapy for HO prophylaxis using a single fraction dose of 700 cGy. The median age was 22 years (range, 12 - 55 years). Treatment plans were generated with the Pinnacle3 treatment planning system (Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Milpitas, CA) with heterogeneity corrections accounted for via convolution/superposition dose calculation algorithm. Treatments were delivered post-operatively within 48 hours using opposed AP/PA fields that generally included the surgical prosthesis as well as the femoral head, ischial ramus, and greater/lesser trochanters. Three male patients received bilateral radiation for fractures involving both hips. The simulation CT scans were retrieved from archives, and the testicles and ovaries were delineated as paired structures on 3 millimeter axial sections so that dose-volume characteristics could be determined. Result(s): The proportion of male patients receiving ipsilateral testicular doses (maximum) greater than 15 cGy, 50 cGy, and 100 cGy was 63%, 24%, and 21%, respectively. Another 20% of male patients had both testicles exposed to maximum doses greater than 15 cGy, the number commonly cited to cause sperm abnormalities. The 3 men undergoing bilateral radiation received an average maximal testicular dose of 422 cGy (range, 187 - 686 cGy). Among female patients, 86% received maximal ipsilateral ovarian doses over 15 cGy. One of the seven women received a dose exceeding 15 cGy to both ovaries (778 cGy and 31.5 cGy). Conclusion(s): Gonadal doses exceeding historically recommended tolerances can result in patients undergoing radiation for HO prophylaxis. Scrotal shields, informing patients about possible fertility issues, and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as an alternative to radiation therapy should be considered as appropriate in the management of this benign condition.",Excluded,0.51798254

About 31 patients with glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma were studied between October 2003 and December 2004. Hypofractionated radiotherapy (3 Gy/fraction/day) was delivered to a total dose of 45 Gy in 15 fractions in 10 patients (32%) who had total excision before radiotherapy and to a total dose of 54 Gy in 18 fractions in 21 patients (68%) who had subtotal excision or biopsy alone. Sex, age, type of surgery, tumor grade, Karnofsky performance status, time between surgery and initiation of radiotherapy, and total radiotherapy dose were analyzed as potential prognostic factors for survival using the univariate log-rank method. The median follow-up was 15 months (4-16 months). A total of 15 patients (48%) died of their illness; 16 patients (52%) were still alive at the last follow-up. The median survival time was 8 months. Actuarial 1-year overall survival was 40%. Type of surgery, timing of radiotherapy after surgery, and initial Karnofsky performance status were significant prognostic factors for survival. No grade 3-4 acute or late neurotoxicity was observed. The tolerance of patients to hypofractionated RT was not different from that for conventional radiotherapy.

METHOD(S):: Patients were of age 50 years or more with invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ, tumor size <=3 cm, and negative surgical margins. After lumpectomy, patients received EBT in 10 fractions over 5 days (34 Gy total). RESULT(S):: Of the 69 patients enrolled, 62 were evaluated at 1 year and 20 patients at 2 years after treatment. At 1 year, 28 (45.2%) patients reported adverse events that were possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment. Most (90%) were grade 1: manageable and typical of radiation therapy. Four events were grade 2: induration/firmness (2), field contracture (1), and seroma (1). One event was grade 3: a draining fistula at the lumpectomy site due to residual effects of a breast infection at 1 month. No recurrences have been reported. Cosmetic ratings were excellent or good in 93.4% of patients at 1 year. Most patients (69%) were energetic most or all of the time.

807,"Geographical clustering of mortality from systemic lupus erythematosus in the United States: contributions of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and solar radiation The objective was to investigate whether spatial variation in poverty, Hispanic ethnicity, and solar radiation explains the strong pattern of geographical clustering of mortality from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the United States. SLE mortality counts for women and men of black and white race in US counties, 1979-1998, were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics. County-level poverty rates and proportions of Hispanic residents were drawn from the 1990 national census. The annual cumulative level of ambient ultraviolet 'B' radiation (UVB) was estimated for each county according to latitude, longitude, and elevation. Maps for the full study population and for sex - and race-specific subpopulations showed that the national pattern of geographical variation in SLE mortality primarily reflected the experience of white women. Formal spatial analysis of the data for white women identified 10 statistically significant, multi-county clusters--four with elevated and six with reduced SLE mortality rates. Multivariate regression modeling established that higher levels of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity, and UVB were each associated with elevated local rates of SLE mortality among white women. Statistical adjustment via the regression model was used to remove effects of these factors on local rates. In a re-application of spatial analysis to the adjusted rates, four clusters 'disappeared'. In those clusters, poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and UVB had explained an average of 58.2% of the deviations between local and national SLE mortality rates. In six clusters (including three that disappeared with adjustment), Hispanic ethnicity explained a larger percentage of the deviations between local and national rates than either poverty or UVB. In multivariate models based on data for black women and for men of both races, poverty and UVB had similar effects on SLE mortality rates to those observed among white women. However, Hispanic ethnicity was not a significant predictor of SLE mortality in any of these other groups. The contributions of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and solar radiation to geographical variation of SLE mortality in the United States are substantial, but these factors do not fully account for the clustering phenomenon.",Excluded,0.5041562
