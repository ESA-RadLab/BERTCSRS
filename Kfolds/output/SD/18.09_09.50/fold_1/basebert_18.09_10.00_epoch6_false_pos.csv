177,"Cancer incidence and mortality in populations living near uranium milling and mining operations in grants, New Mexico, 1950-2004 In a previous cohort study of workers engaged in uranium milling and mining activities near Grants, Cibola County, New Mexico, we found lung cancer mortality to be significantly increased among underground miners. Uranium mining took place from early in the 1950s to 1990, and the Grants Uranium Mill operated from 1958-1990. The present study evaluates cancer mortality during 1950-2004 and cancer incidence during 1982-2004 among county residents. Standardized mortality (SMR) and incidence (SIR) ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed, with observed numbers of cancer deaths and cases compared to expected values based on New Mexico cancer rates. The total numbers of cancer deaths and incident cancers were close to that expected (SMR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07; SIR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.02). Lung cancer mortality and incidence were significantly increased among men (SMR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21; SIR 1.40, 95% CI 1.18-1.64) but not women (SMR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85-1.10; SIR 1.01, 95% CI 0.78-1.29). Similarly, among the population of the three census tracts near the Grants Uranium Mill, lung cancer mortality was significantly elevated among men (SMR 1.57; 95% CI 1.21-1.99) but not women (SMR 1.12; 95% CI 0.75-1.61). Except for an elevation in mortality for stomach cancer among women (SMR 1.30; 95% CI 1.03-1.63), which declined over the 55-year observation period, no significant increases in SMRs or SIRs for 22 other cancers were found. Although etiological inferences cannot be drawn from these ecological data, the excesses of lung cancer among men seem likely to be due to previously reported risks among underground miners from exposure to radon gas and its decay products. Smoking, socioeconomic factors or ethnicity may also have contributed to the lung cancer excesses observed in our study. The stomach cancer increase was highest before the uranium mill began operation and then decreased to normal levels. With the exception of male lung cancer, this study provides no clear or consistent evidence that the operation of uranium mills and mines adversely affected cancer incidence or mortality of county residents.",Excluded,0.628068
647,"Radioprotective effect of the Barbados Cherry (Malpighia glabra L.) against radiopharmaceutical Iodine-131 in Wistar rats in vivo Background: The increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables has contributed to the improvement of populational health, due in part, to the abundance of antioxidants in these foods. Antioxidants reduce the level of oxidative damage to DNA caused by free radicals and ionizing radiation, including the radioisotope iodine-131 (131I). This isotope is used for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid injuries, such as hyperthyroidism and cancer. Method(s): This study aimed to evaluate the radioprotective and cytotoxic activity of acute and subchronic treatments with Barbados Cherry (BC) (Malpighia glabra L.) fruit juice (5 mg), which is rich in potent antioxidants such as vitamin C, phenols, carotenoids, anthocyanins and yellow flavonoids and its activity against the mutagenic activity of the therapeutic dose of 25 muCi of radioiodine for hyperthyroidism. The test system used was the bone marrow cells of Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) that were treated in vivo by gavage. Result(s): BC showed radioprotective activity in acute treatments, which is most likely due to the joint action of its antioxidant components. In subchronic treatments, the continuous treatment presented an effective radioprotective activity, which was significantly different from treatment with the radiopharmaceutical only. Treatment with BC prior to (PRE) and simultaneous with (SIM) ionizing radiation decreased the number of induced chromosomal alterations, while post-treatment produced no protective effect. In addition, BC exhibited no cytotoxic activity. Conclusion(s): These data serve as evidence that BC can be used as a preventive health measure to improve public health quality by countering the action of inevitable exposure to mutagens, such as 131I. © 2014 Dusman et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded,0.62806463
1037,"Increased incidence of haematological cancer among physicians in a University Hospital OBJECTIVES: The oral report of eight cases of cancer over a period of 3 years among physicians working in a French University Hospital led us to conduct a retrospective cohort study to compare the incidence of cancer in these physicians with that of the general population living in the same area., METHOD: The cohort consisted of 940 physicians (72% male, 28% female) who had worked for at least 1 year in this hospital between 1945 and 1994 (a total of 10,693 person-years). The incidence of cancer among physicians was compared with that of the general population using a local cancer registry which has recorded all cancer cases occurring in the Department between 1979 and 1994. Standardised incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated for all causes of cancer and site by site., RESULTS: Although the global incidence of cancer did not differ from that of the general population (SIR=0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59-1.5), a significantly increased incidence of haematological malignancy was found among physicians (SIR=5.45; 95% CI 2-11.9)., CONCLUSIONS: These findings pointed out the risk of lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer among physicians who started working after 1945 when the first rules pertaining to protection from ionising radiation came into effect. However, limitations of this study such as limited statistical power and lack of individual exposure data should be considered in the interpretation of these findings. Possible aetiological factors responsible for these risks are discussed. Education about general safety protection programmes against carcinogenic risk factors including physical, biological and chemical agents still remains a priority among physicians.",Excluded,0.6280618
548,"Analysis of EPR and FISH studies of radiation doses in persons who lived in the upper reaches of the Techa River Waterborne radioactive releases into the Techa River from the Mayak Production Association in Russia during 1949-1956 resulted in significant doses to about 30,000 persons who lived in downstream settlements. The residents were exposed to internal and external radiation. Two methods for reconstruction of the external dose are considered in this paper, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements of teeth, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) measurements of chromosome translocations in circulating lymphocytes. The main issue in the application of the EPR and FISH methods for reconstruction of the external dose for the Techa Riverside residents was strontium radioisotopes incorporated in teeth and bones that act as a source of confounding local exposures. In order to estimate and subtract doses from incorporated (89,90)Sr, the EPR and FISH assays were supported by measurements of (90)Sr-body burdens and estimates of (90)Sr concentrations in dental tissues by the luminescence method. The resulting dose estimates derived from EPR to FISH measurements for residents of the upper Techa River were found to be consistent: The mean values vary from 510 to 550 mGy for the villages located close to the site of radioactive release to 130-160 mGy for the more distant villages. The upper bound of individual estimates for both methods is equal to 2.2-2.3 Gy. The EPR- and FISH-based dose estimates were compared with the doses calculated for the donors using the most recent Techa River Dosimetry System (TRDS). The TRDS external dose assessments are based on the data on contamination of the Techa River floodplain, simulation of air kerma above the contaminated soil, age-dependent lifestyles and individual residence histories. For correct comparison, TRDS-based doses were calculated from two sources: external exposure from the contaminated environment and internal exposure from (137)Cs incorporated in donors' soft tissues. It is shown here that the TRDS-based absorbed doses in tooth enamel and muscle are in agreement with EPR- and FISH-based estimates within uncertainty bounds. Basically, this agreement between the estimates has confirmed the validity of external doses calculated with the TRDS.",Excluded,0.6280577
329,"Harderian Gland Tumorigenesis: Low-Dose and LET Response Increased cancer risk remains a primary concern for travel into deep space and may preclude manned missions to Mars due to large uncertainties that currently exist in estimating cancer risk from the spectrum of radiations found in space with the very limited available human epidemiological radiation-induced cancer data. Existing data on human risk of cancer from X-ray and gamma-ray exposure must be scaled to the many types and fluences of radiations found in space using radiation quality factors and dose-rate modification factors, and assuming linearity of response since the shapes of the dose responses at low doses below 100 mSv are unknown. The goal of this work was to reduce uncertainties in the relative biological effect (RBE) and linear energy transfer (LET) relationship for space-relevant doses of charged-particle radiation-induced carcinogenesis. The historical data from the studies of Fry et al. and Alpen et al. for Harderian gland (HG) tumors in the female CB6F1 strain of mouse represent the most complete set of experimental observations, including dose dependence, available on a specific radiation-induced tumor in an experimental animal using heavy ion beams that are found in the cosmic radiation spectrum. However, these data lack complete information on low-dose responses below 0.1 Gy, and for chronic low-dose-rate exposures, and there are gaps in the LET region between 25 and 190 keV/mum. In this study, we used the historical HG tumorigenesis data as reference, and obtained HG tumor data for 260 MeV/u silicon (LET ~70 keV/mum) and 1,000 MeV/u titanium (LET ~100 keV/mum) to fill existing gaps of data in this LET range to improve our understanding of the dose-response curve at low doses, to test for deviations from linearity and to provide RBE estimates. Animals were also exposed to five daily fractions of 0.026 or 0.052 Gy of 1,000 MeV/u titanium ions to simulate chronic exposure, and HG tumorigenesis from this fractionated study were compared to the results from single 0.13 or 0.26 Gy acute titanium exposures. Theoretical modeling of the data show that a nontargeted effect model provides a better fit than the targeted effect model, providing important information at space-relevant doses of heavy ions.",Excluded,0.62805325
1144,"Association of radiation risk in the second and third generations with polymorphisms in the genes CYP1A1, CYP2E1, GSTP1 and changes in the thyroid Background: To study the association of radiation risk in the 2nd-3rd generations with polymorphisms in the genes CYP1A1, CYP2E1, GSTP1 and changes in the thyroid. Method(s): 5 polymorphic gene variants (rs1048943, rs4646421, rs2070676, rs3813867, rs1695) were studied in 399 people living in the East Kazakhstan region in this research. 248 people of the 2nd-3rd generation lived in the territory with radiation exposure in Abai, Borodulikha areas, and 151 people the comparison group lived in Kurchum district without radiation exposure comparable in sex and age with control group. Result(s): The results show that there is a significant association of rs1048943 in exposed and unexposed groups (p < 0.003), and the absence of association of rs4646421, rs2070676, rs3813867, rs1695 in the studied groups. The mean value of thyroxine in carriers of the AG + GG genotype of rs4646421 is significantly lower than in AA genotype carriers (p = 0.04); no significant changes were found in genotypes' distribution with thyroid-stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid peroxidase indicators. Significant changes were in levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase between exposed and unexposed groups (p = 0.007). The thyroxine-thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were not significantly different in exposed and unexposed groups (p > 0.3). Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated the association of rs1048943 polymorphism with living in the radiation zone in the 2nd and 3rd generations for the first time. Thyroxine levels decrease was identified in the 2nd and 3rd generation residents of the exposed area, as well as a significant increase of anti-thyroid peroxidase occurs in individuals of the 2nd and 3rd generation living in areas with radiation exposure.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded,0.6280518
252,"In vitro fertilization rate of mouse oocytes with spermatozoa from the F1 offspring of males irradiated with 1.0 Gy 137Cs gamma-rays Previous studies suggest that the spermatozoa from acutely irradiated male mice exhibit a reduced fertilization rate in vitro with the maximum decrease occurring for spermatozoa produced 6 weeks after irradiation (Y. Matsuda et al., Mutation Res. 142 (1985) 59-63). We have found that spermatozoa from unirradiated F1 males conceived 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation also exhibit a significantly reduced fertilization rate in vitro. After acute 137Cs gamma-irradiation yielding an absorbed dose of 1.0 Gy, adult CD1 F0 male mice were mated at weekly intervals with unirradiated female CD1 mice. Unirradiated adult males from F1 litters conceived 5 and 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation were allowed to mature. Their epididymal spermatozoa were evaluated for in vitro fertilization rates using oocytes from unirradiated 8-12-week-old CD1 females. The mean fertilization rate for spermatozoa from F1 males conceived 5 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (80.74 +/- 15.74 SD %, n = 5) did not differ significantly from the control fertilization rate (89.40 +/- 10.94 SD %, n = 8). However, the fertilization rate for spermatozoa from F1 males conceived 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (56.14 +/- 21.93 SD %, n = 5) was significantly less than the fertilization rate for control spermatozoa (p < 0.006) or for that of the F1 males conceived 5 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (p < 0.04). These data suggest that spermatozoa obtained 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation can transmit a decrease in fertilization rate to the F1 generation males as well as exhibit decreased fertilization rate themselves when tested directly in vitro.",Excluded,0.62805015
1029,"Radionuclide monitoring in Northern Ireland of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident Northern Ireland received higher radiation doses due to the radionuclide contamination from the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident than did the south of England. Levels of radioactive iodine ((131)I) and caesium ((137)Cs) in cows' milk in Northern Ireland increased to 166 and 120 Bq/l respectively in May 1986, but had decreased by factors of one million, and of twenty-five, respectively, by 1 September 1986. The resultant radiation doses represent less than one per cent of those received by a Northern Ireland individual over a period of 40 years from natural background radiation sources. The added risk to any individual from the Chernobyl accident will therefore be very small and may best be judged in the context of the enormously greater risk of death due to potentially preventable diseases, such as smoking-related lung cancer, and coronary heart disease.",Excluded,0.62804747
210,"Incidence of Breast Cancer in the Life Span Study of Atomic Bomb Survivors: 1958-2009 The importance of reproductive history in breast tissue development and etiology of sporadic breast cancer in females is well established. However, there is limited evidence of factors, other than age, that modify risk of radiation-related breast cancer. In this study, we evaluated breast cancer incidence in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors, adding 11 years of follow-up and incorporating reproductive history data. We used Poisson regression models to describe radiation risks and modifying effects of age and reproductive factors. Among 62,534 females, we identified 1,470 breast cancers between 1958 and 2009. Of 397 new cases diagnosed since 1998, 75% were exposed before age 20. We found a strong linear dose response with excess relative risk (ERR) of 1.12 per Gy [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73 to 1.59] for females at age 70 after exposure at age 30. The ERR decreased with increasing attained age ( P = 0.007) while excess absolute rate (EAR) increased with attained age up to age 70 ( P < 0.001). Age at menarche was a strong modifier of the radiation effect: for a given dose, both the ERR and EAR decreased with increasing age at menarche ( P = 0.007 and P < 0.001). Also, independently, age-at-exposure effects on ERR and EAR differed before and after menarche ( P = 0.043 and P = 0.015, respectively, relative to log-linear trends), with highest risks for exposures around menarche. Despite the small number of male breast cancers (n = 10), the data continue to suggest a dose response (ERR per Gy = 5.7; 95% CI: 0.3 to 30.8; P = 0.018). Persistently increased risk of female breast cancer after radiation exposure and its modification pattern suggests heightened breast sensitivity during puberty.",Excluded,0.6280467
1019,"Statistical modeling of carcinogenic risks in dogs that inhaled 238PuO2 Combined analyses of data on 260 life-span beagle dogs that inhaled 238PuO2 at the Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute (ITRI) and at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) were conducted. The hazard functions (age-specific risks) for incidence of lung, bone and liver tumors were modeled as a function of cumulative radiation dose, and estimates of lifetime risks based on the combined data were developed. For lung tumors, linear-quadratic functions provided an adequate fit to the data from both laboratories, and linear functions provided an adequate fit when analyses were restricted to doses less than 20 Gy. The estimated risk coefficients for these functions were significantly larger when based on ITRI data compared to PNNL data, and dosimetry biases are a possible explanation for this difference. There was also evidence that the bone tumor response functions differed for the two laboratories, although these differences occurred primarily at high doses. These functions were clearly nonlinear (even when restricted to average skeletal doses less than 1 Gy), and evidence of radiation-induced bone tumors was found for doses less than 0.5 Gy in both laboratories. Liver tumor risks were similar for the two laboratories, and linear functions provided an adequate fit to these data. Lifetime risk estimates for lung and bone tumors derived from these data had wide confidence intervals, but were consistent with estimates currently used in radiation protection. The dog-based lifetime liver tumor risk estimate was an order of magnitude larger than that used in radiation protection, but the latter also carries large uncertainties. The application of common statistical methodology to data from two studies has allowed the identification of differences in these studies and has provided a basis for common risk estimates based on both data sets.",Excluded,0.6280465
208,"Genotoxic effects of intermediate frequency magnetic fields on blood leukocytes in vitro The widespread presence of electromagnetic sources in daily life has initiated several studies on the effects of radiofrequency and power frequency fields. Only few investigations on the genotoxic effects of exposure to intermediate frequency magnetic fields (IF-MF) have been done so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate possible genotoxic effects of exposure to 123.90 kHz and 250.80 kHz IF-MF on canine and human blood. Blood was exposed to IF-MF at 630 A/m (0.79 mT) and 80 A/m (0.10 m T) with exposure durations of 1-5 h (hourly), 20 and 24 h. Cylindrically divided Petri dish system was developed for in vitro exposures where different induced current could be achieved in the samples at the same magnetic flux density level. For the assessment of genotoxicity the alkaline comet assay was applied. We detected a statistically significant increase in DNA damage only following 20 h exposure to IF-MF.

462,"Three-dimensional structures of avian beta-microseminoproteins: insight from the chicken egg-specific beta-microseminoprotein 3 paralog Beta-microseminoproteins (MSMBs) are small disulfide-rich proteins that are conserved among vertebrates. These proteins exhibit diverse biological activities and were mainly reported to play a role in male fertility, immunity, and embryogenesis. In this work, we focused on the chicken MSMB3 protein that was previously depicted as an egg antibacterial protein. We report that MSMB3 protein is exclusively expressed in the reproductive tissues of laying hens (in contrast to chicken MSMB1 and MSMB2 paralogs), to be incorporated in the egg white during the process of egg formation. We also showed that chicken MSMB3 possesses highly conserved orthologs in bird species, including Neognathae and Palaeognathae. Chicken MSMB3 was purified from egg white using heparin affinity chromatography and was analyzed by top-down and bottom-up proteomics. Several proteoforms could be characterized, and a homodimer was further evidenced by NMR spectroscopy. The X-ray structure of chicken MSMB3 was solved for the first time, revealing that this protein adopts a novel dimeric arrangement. The highly cationic MSMB3 protein exhibits a distinct electrostatic distribution compared with chicken MSMB1 and MSMB2 structural models, and with published mammalian MSMB structures. The specific incorporation of MSMB3 paralog in the egg, and its phylogenetic conservation in birds together with its peculiar homodimer arrangement and physicochemical properties, suggests that the MSMB3 protein has evolved to play a critical role during the embryonic development of avian species. These new data are likely to stimulate research to elucidate the structure/function relationships of MSMB paralogs and orthologs in the animal kingdom.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Method(s): Specific surveys of agricultural workers in Switzerland and France were conducted (N=1538). Multivariate logistic regressions identified occupational sunburn determinants. Occupational and recreational sun protection habits were estimated and correlated. Result(s): One-year occupational and recreational sunburn prevalences were 19.8% and 11.5%, respectively. Occupational sunburn increased with having a recent recreational sunburn, highly sensitive skin, young age, high perceived skin cancer risk, using sunscreen, and not wearing a hat. Correlation between protection habits during work and leisure was substantial (r s 0.5 to 0.7). Skin health knowledge was high and pro-tanning attitude moderate.

869,"Evaluation of cancer tests of 1,3-butadiene using internal dose, genotoxic potency, and a multiplicative risk model In cancer tests with 1,3-butadiene (BD), the mouse is much more sensitive than the rat. This is considered to be related to the metabolism of BD to the epoxide metabolites, 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (EB), 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane, and 1,2-epoxy-3,4-butanediol. This study evaluates whether the large difference in outcome in cancer tests with BD could be predicted quantitatively on the basis of the concentration over time in blood (AUC) of the epoxide metabolites, their mutagenic potency, and a multiplicative cancer risk model, which has earlier been used for ionizing radiation. Published data on hemoglobin adduct levels from inhalation experiments with BD were used for the estimation of the AUC of the epoxide metabolites in the cancer tests. The estimated AUC of the epoxides were then weighed together to a total genotoxic dose, by using the relative genotoxic potency of the respective epoxide inferred from in vitro hprt mutation assays using EB as standard. The tumor incidences predicted with the risk model on the basis of the total genotoxic dose correlated well with the earlier observed tumor incidences in the cancer tests. The total genotoxic dose that leads to a doubling of the tumor incidences was estimated to be the same in both species, 9 to 10 mmol/Lxh EB-equivalents. The study validates the applicability of the multiplicative cancer risk model to genotoxic chemicals. Furthermore, according to this evaluation, different epoxide metabolites are predominating cancer-initiating agents in the cancer tests with BD, the diepoxide in the mouse, and the monoepoxides in the rat.",Excluded,0.6280347

The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of cancer in NM technologists in relation to work history, procedures performed and radioprotection practices. Methods From the US Radiologic Technologists cohort study, 72 755 radiologic technologists who completed a 2003-2005 questionnaire were followed for cancer mortality through 31 December 2012 and for cancer incidence through completion of a questionnaire in 2012-2013. Multivariable-adjusted models were used to estimate HRs for total cancer incidence and mortality by history of ever performing NM procedures and frequency of performing specific diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and associated radiation protection measures by decade. Results During follow-up (mean=7.5 years), 960 incident cancers and 425 cancer deaths were reported among the 22 360 technologists who worked with NM procedures. We observed no increased risk of cancer incidence (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04) or death (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.19) among workers who ever performed NM procedures. HRs for cancer incidence but not mortality were higher for technologists who began performing therapeutic procedures in 1960 and later compared with the 1950s. Frequency of performing diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and use of radioprotection measures were not consistently associated with cancer risk. No clear associations were observed for specific cancers, but results were based on small numbers. Conclusion Cancer incidence and mortality were not associated with NM work history practices, including greater frequency of procedures performed.Copyright © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

In the present study, we assess the stratum corneum (SC) hydration in sun-exposed males and females., METHODS: A total of 168 subjects (84 males and 84 females) aged 19-75 years were enrolled. A multifunctional skin physiology monitor was used to measure SC hydration., RESULTS: In comparison with non-sun exposure, sun exposure does not cause a significant change in SC hydration in either young males or young females, whereas in aged females, a significant reduction of SC hydration is seen on the forehead and the dorsal hand of sun-exposed subjects. SC hydration on the canthus of both aged males and aged females is significantly lower than that of young subjects. Additionally, SC hydration on the dorsal hand of aged females is also significantly lower as compared with young females. Sun-induced reduction of SC hydration is more evident on the dorsal hand of aged females than that of males (P<0.001). Moreover, the SC rehydration capacity is significantly lower in sun-exposed aged females than in age-matched males., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that sun-induced changes of the SC hydration property vary with age and gender.

852,"The metabolic effects of abdominal irradiation in man with and without dietary therapy with an elemental diet The metabolic effects of abdominal radiotherapy were assessed in patients with pelvic neoplasms, and the effects of supplementation of the diet with an 'elemental' diet assessed. Therapeutic irradiation led to significant mean weight losses of 1.4 kg in control patients and 1.0 kg in patients receiving 'elemental' diet supplements. Irradiation was associated with small falls in plasma potassium and calcium concentrations in both groups. In the 'elemental' group there was a small increase in circulating alanine and insulin concentrations and a fall in glycerol and ketone body concentrations, but all variables remained within or close to normal basal reference ranges. Plasma albumin fell slightly but significantly in the 'elemental' diet group from 44 +/- 1 to 42 +/- 1 g/litre during treatment. Is is concluded that modern radiotherapy is no more than a modest catabolic stimulus. Long-term dietary supplementation with 'elemental' diets in ill subjects did not produce adverse effects.",Excluded,0.62803274

The deduced dose dependency agrees well with a previous analysis in terms of a non-parametric proportional hazards model, and confirms the temporal distribution which has been used in the Radioepidemiological Tables of NIH.

871,"Exogenous T3 mimics long day lengths in Siberian hamsters Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) exhibit seasonal cycles of reproduction driven by changes in day length. Day length is encoded endogenously by the duration of nocturnal melatonin (Mel) secretion from the pineal gland. Short-duration Mel signals stimulate reproduction and long-duration signals inhibit reproduction. The mechanism by which Mel signals are decoded at the level of neural target tissues remains uncharacterized. In Siberian hamsters, exposure to short day lengths or injections of Mel in long days results in a decrease in hypothalamic expression of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2) mRNA. Dio2 catalyzes the conversion of the thyroid hormone thyroxine to triiodothyronine (T3). Thus exposure to short and long day lengths should decrease and increase hypothalamic T3 concentrations, respectively. We tested the hypothesis that exogenous T3 administered to short-day hamsters would mimic exposure to long day lengths with respect to gonadal stimulation. Hamsters gestated and raised in short day lengths that exhibited photoinhibition of the testes were given daily subutaneous injections of T3 or saline vehicle for 4 wk beginning at week 12 of life. The results indicate that exogenous T3 induced gonadal growth in short-day hamsters and delayed spontaneous gonadal development by an interval equal to the number of weeks during which T3 was administered. T3 injections delayed gonadal regression if given coincident with the transfer of hamsters from long to short day lengths. These results suggest that T3 mimics long day exposure in Siberian hamsters and may serve as an intermediate step between the Mel rhythm and the reproductive response.",Excluded,0.6280317
296,"Irradiation induced inversions suppress recombination between the M locus and morphological markers in Aedes aegypti Background: Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of arthropod-borne viruses and one of the most widespread and invasive mosquito species. Due to the lack of efficient specific drugs or vaccination strategies, vector population control methods, such as the sterile insect technique, are receiving renewed interest. However, availability of a reliable genetic sexing strategy is crucial, since there is almost zero tolerance for accidentally released females. Development of genetic sexing strains through classical genetics is hindered by genetic recombination that is not suppressed in males as is the case in many Diptera. Isolation of naturally-occurring or irradiation-induced inversions can enhance the genetic stability of genetic sexing strains developed through genetically linking desirable phenotypes with the male determining region. Result(s): For the induction and isolation of inversions through irradiation, 200 male pupae of the 'BRA' wild type strain were irradiated at 30 Gy and 100 isomale lines were set up by crossing with homozygous 'red-eye' (re) mutant females. Recombination between re and the M locus and the white (w) gene (causing a recessive white eye phenotype when mutated) and the M locus was tested in 45 and 32 lines, respectively. One inversion (Inv35) reduced recombination between both re and the M locus, and wand the M locus, consistent with the presence of a rather extended inversion between the two morphological mutations, that includes the M locus. Another inversion (Inv5) reduced recombination only between w and the M locus. In search of naturally-occurring, recombination-suppressing inversions, homozygous females from the red eye and the white eye strains were crossed with seventeen and fourteen wild type strains collected worldwide, representing either recently colonized or long-established laboratory populations. Despite evidence of varying frequencies of recombination, no combination led to the elimination or substantial reduction of recombination. Conclusion(s): Inducing inversions through irradiation is a feasible strategy to isolate recombination suppressors either on the M or the m chromosome for Aedes aegypti. Such inversions can be incorporated in genetic sexing strains developed through classical genetics to enhance their genetic stability and support SIT or other approaches that aim to population suppression through male-delivered sterility.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.6280312
127,"Comparison of documented and recalled histories of exposure to diagnostic x-rays in case-control studies of thyroid cancer Most information concerning possible cancer risks attributable to lifetime exposure to diagnostic x-rays comes from studies in which x-ray history was ascertained by interview or questionnaire, but little is known about the accuracy of such information. The authors assessed agreement between medical x-ray histories obtained through interview and by review of medical records from thyroid cancer case-control studies conducted in Sweden (1985-1992; 123 cases and 123 controls) and from members of a prepaid health plan in the United States (1986-1991; 50 cases and 50 controls). In both studies, substantial disagreement was found between the numbers of x-ray examinations reported in the interview and in the medical records. There was an indication of relatively poorer reporting among controls, particularly for certain types of x-ray examinations and for large numbers of such examinations. Estimates of the risk associated with exposure to diagnostic x-rays were similar, regardless of whether interview or medical record data were used, even though ordinal dose classifications based on the two sources differed considerably. In populations with a high frequency of exposure, spurious associations with numbers of x-ray examinations or estimated thyroid dose might arise because of differences in recall. However, in the present data, reporting errors by cases and controls seemed to be largely nondifferential.",Excluded,0.62803096
941,"Factors influencing the release of volatiles in Anastrepha obliqua males (Diptera: Tephritidae) During sexual signaling, males of Anastrepha obliqua (Macquart) form leks and attract females by producing sounds and releasing volatile compounds. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence time of time of day, age, irradiation, mating status, and the presence of host fruit on the release of volatile components by laboratory-reared A. obliqua males. A. obliqua males released four compounds identified by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as (E,E)-alpha-farnesene, (Z,E)-alpha-farnesene, (Z)-3-nonenol, and a farnesene isomer during calling behavior. Although males released volatiles during the entire day, the amount of volatiles was higher in the early morning and afternoon hours. Males began to emit volatiles when they were 6 d old, but only the amount of (Z)-3-nonenol was affected by age. Irradiation of flies with gamma rays from a 60Co source at a dose rate of 80 [corrected] Gy significantly reduced the amount of volatiles released during calling behavior. The amount of volatiles was lower in recently mated males than virgin males. However, there were no significant differences between virgin males and males 24 h after mating. The presence of host fruit did not affect the amount of volatiles compared with the control.",Excluded,0.6280308

The aim of this study was to identify serum metabolite biomarkers that might be used to predict the side-effects of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Patients and Methods: Metabolomic analysis of serum samples from 26 patients with ESCC that were collected before neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was performed. The metabolites associated with hematological toxicity or nephrotoxicity were evaluated. Result(s): Serum levels of glutaric acid, glucuronic acid, and cystine were significantly higher in hematological toxicity, and phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines exhibited a tendency to be higher in those with hematological toxicity. The serum level of pyruvic acid was significantly lower in nephrotoxicity, and lysophosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylethanolamines tended to be lower in those with nephrotoxicity. Conclusion(s): Our study found that serum levels of some metabolites differed significantly between patients with and without hematological or renal side-effects. These metabolites may be useful biomarkers for predicting hematological toxicity or nephrotoxicity after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for ESCC.Copyright © 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

245,"Solid cancer risk dependence on the Pasquill-Gifford atmospheric stability classes in a radiological event In a radiological event, the lack of preliminary information about the site of explosion and the difficulty in predicting the accurate path and distribution of radioactive plumes makes it difficult to predict expected health effects of exposed individuals. So far, in such a health evaluation, radiation-induced stochastic health effects such as cancer are not included. The Pasquill-Gifford atmospheric classes generally allow connecting atmospheric stability with dispersion of radioactive contaminants to the environment. In this work, an environmental release of radioactive Cs-137 was simulated and the resulting relative risk for solid cancer incidence among the affected population calculated. The HotSpot health physics code was used to simulate the radioactive atmospheric dispersion and calculate the Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE), which was then used to estimate the relative risk of cancer incidence. The main results from this work suggest that the relative cancer risk and atmospheric stability classes are linked by differences in the TEDE. Such a finding may support triage, because it adds additional information on the potentially affected population at the early stages of an emergency response.",Excluded,0.62802964

54,"Potential welfare impacts of kill-trapping European moles (Talpa europaea) using scissor traps and Duffus traps: A Post mortem examination study Moles are widely trapped as pests on farms and amenity land in Britain. Spring traps for killing mammals generally require welfare approval in the UK, but mole traps are exempt. Previous research demonstrated wide variation in the mechanical performance of mole traps. In this context, we aimed to produce new data on the welfare impact of kill-trapping moles in the field. We collected 50 moles trapped in southern England (November 2008-August 2009). Captures peaked during the peak in male breeding activity, when captures were almost exclusively male. Post mortem and x-ray (radiation) examinations were conducted to determine injuries and likely cause of death. No moles sustained damaged skulls or upper cervical vertebrae (which could cause unconsciousness immediately). The primary identifiable cause of death for all but one mole was acute haemorrhage; this contrasts with the findings of the only previous such study, in which only one mole showed clear evidence of haemorrhaging. Some moles may have asphyxiated although it was not possible to determine this. Moles most likely became unconscious before death, but times to unconsciousness, and death, can be determined only through killing trials and further investigation is urgently needed. This should be done through the spring traps approval process; this could improve the welfare standards of trapping for many thousands of moles each year. Mole trapping for long-term population control might be better targeted after the peak in male breeding activity, when females are more likely to be caught, but this would threaten the welfare of dependent young underground.Copyright © 2015 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.",Excluded,0.628029
34,"Indoor exposure to 222Rn: a public health perspective The objective of this study was to assess the lung cancer risk resulting from indoor radon exposure in the province of Quebec, Canada, and to evaluate the efficacy of mitigation measures to reduce this exposure. Concentrations of radon were determined in a representative sample of houses, and the corresponding lung cancer risk estimates were generated using the BEIR IV model, taking into account smoking, residential mobility, and regional variations in radon concentrations. Mean (geometric) radon concentrations in basements (n = 418) and on first floors (n = 319) were, respectively, 34.4 (95% CI-30.6 to 38.8) and 16.5 Bq m(-3) (14.2 to 19.3). A total of 109 deaths from lung cancer are predicted to occur as a result of this exposure in a cohort of 60,000 people. Detecting all residences with high radon concentrations (equal to or above 200 Bq m(-3)) and implementing mitigation measures in each of them would reduce by 4 the number of lung cancer deaths attributable to indoor radon exposure. A reduction of 0.05% in the prevalence of smoking would prevent as many deaths from lung cancer as would radon mitigation. From a public health perspective, in order to reduce mortality from lung cancer, most efforts should be focused on smoking, not on the relatively minor and hardly preventable population risk arising from household radon exposure.",Excluded,0.6280289
499,"Flexible Modeling of the Association between Cumulative Exposure to Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation from Cardiac Procedures and Risk of Cancer in Adults with Congenital Heart Disease Adults with congenital heart disease are increasingly being exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) from cardiac procedures. In a recent study, Cohen et al. (Circulation. 2018;137(13):1334-1345) reported an association between increased LDIR exposure and cancer incidence but did not explore temporal relationships. Yet, the impact of past exposures probably accumulates over years, and its strength may depend on the amount of time elapsed since exposure. Furthermore, LDIR procedures performed shortly before a cancer diagnosis may have been ordered because of early symptoms of cancer, raising concerns about reversal causality bias. To address these challenges, we combined flexible modeling of cumulative exposures with competing-risks methodology to estimate separate associations of time-varying LDIR exposure with cancer incidence and all-cause mortality. Among 24,833 patients from the Quebec Congenital Heart Disease Database, 602 had incident cancer and 500 died during a follow-up period of up to 15 years (1995-2010). Initial results suggested a strong association of cancer incidence with very recent LDIR exposures, likely reflecting reverse causality bias. When exposure was lagged by 2 years, an increased cumulative LDIR dose from the previous 2-6 years was associated with increased cancer incidence, with a stronger association for women. These results illustrate the importance of accurate modeling of temporal relationships between time-varying exposures and health outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

213,"Development of a medical examination program for former workers at a Department of Energy national laboratory BACKGROUND: As a part of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Former Workers' Medical Surveillance Program, a Needs Assessment was conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The objective was to identify former LANL employees who may be at significant risk for occupational disease and determine whether a medical examination program could reduce morbidity or mortality. We describe the needs assessment approach used at LANL., METHODS: An algorithm was developed to make needs determinations. Information on factors including exposure, health impacts, size of exposed populations, and LANL worker concerns and recommendations were obtained. Each of these factors was scored from 1 to 3. The resulting factor sum was then multiplied by a binary (1 or 0) intervention suitability factor which was 1 if both of the following were available: (1) a screening test with acceptable sensitivity and specificity for the health outcome of concern; and (2) an intervention that decreases morbidity or mortality. This resulted in an Intervention Needs Score that was used to set priorities for the medical examination program for the estimated 35,000 former LANL workers., RESULTS: Analysis of the algorithm output suggested that six exposure categories be recommended for consideration in a medical examination program. Beryllium, asbestos, and noise clearly warranted inclusion. Lead and ionizing radiation required careful consideration regarding availability of screening tests. Solvents were problematic due to the lack of screening tests and suitable intervention in formerly exposed workers., CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm approach to the needs assessment at LANL documented that six chemical and physical agents should be considered as candidates for inclusion in a medical examination program for former workers.

427,"Sargramostim accelerates leukocyte recovery and improves mortality rate at day 60 in a non-human primate model of hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome when administered 48 h after total body irradiation Background: Hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) occurs in individuals that are exposed to high levels of radiation over a short period of time. The destruction of bone marrow leads to pancytopenia, which increases the incidence of infections and accounts for the majority of morbidity and mortality. Sargramostim (yeast-derived rhGM-CSF) is a leukocyte growth factor that promotes differentiation, maturation and activation of granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages. Method(s): We evaluated the efficacy of repeat administrations of sargramostim (7 mug/kg/day) in a blinded, GLP study in total body irradiated non-human primates (NHPs) when administered 48 h postirradiation with minimal supportive care (e.g., no blood products or individualized antibiotics). The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of sargramostim versus vehicle on mortality rate at Day 60 in irradiated male and female NHPs at LD50-60/60 (n=36/group). Secondary objectives included the efficacy of sargramostim on overall survival and its effect on hematology parameters. The study included an exploratory arm of male and female NHPs that were irradiated at a LD70-80/60 (n= 18/group) and received the same treatments. Result(s): Sargramostim decreased the mortality rate at Day 60 by 36% in the LD50-60/60group (p=0.0018) and by 44% in the LD70-80/60group (p=0.0076). Additionally, neutrophil, platelet, lymphocyte, and white blood cell levels in survivors demonstrated accelerated recovery in the sargramostim-treated NHPs in the LD50-60/60and LD70-80/60groups. Conclusion(s): Treatment with sargramostim (7 mug/kg/day) beginning at 48 h, in the absence of blood products and individualized antibiotics, suggests that the use of sargramostim is a viable therapeutic strategy for H-ARS in a mass casualty event.",Excluded,0.6280247

The parameter employed was induction of reciprocal translocations. Two assumptions were made: human radiosensitivity equals that of the mouse; and dose-response is linear. From observations with acute gamma irradiation the estimate of risk per 10(-2) Gy was as follows: 39 translocation heterozygotes are expected among one million F1 conceptions, 5 cases of multiple congenital anomalies, 25 abortions recorded and 49 unrecorded. Chronic gamma irradiation at dose rates of 1.3 X 10(-5), 1.7 X 10(-4) and 1.0 X 10(-4) Gy/min was 3 to 10 times less effective. Exposure to 4.2 GeV deuterons proved inferior in effectiveness to gamma irradiation. Chronic exposure to 4.1 MeV neutrons delivered at 8 X 10(-4) Gy/min showed 7 times the effectiveness of chronic gamma irradiation. Administration of tritiated water (from 37 to 37 X 10(2) kBq/g b.w.) to rats entailed a risk of the same order of magnitude as external chronic gamma irradiation. Reduction of genetic risk was achieved by pretreatment with either AFT-, ATP-serotonin mixtures or the molecular combinations, Adeturon and Cytriphos. Study of interspecies differences in genetic radiosensitivity showed decline in the following order: rat-rabbit-mouse-Syrian hamster. A dose-rate effect was most clearly seen in the rat, and least clearly in the rabbit.

472,"An examination of radon awareness, risk communication, and radon risk reduction in a Hispanic community Purpose: Radiation risk communication is a critical component of radiation protection and the public's understanding of radiation risks and benefits. Risk communication becomes even more complicated when considering cultural and language differences. In the US, many diverse communities face risk communication challenges. We obtained radon testing data to evaluate patterns of radon testing in Allentown, the third largest city in Pennsylvania. Radon exposure is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking and is associated with over 21,000 lung cancer deaths in the US annually. It is estimated that 1 in every 15 homes in the US has elevated radon levels above the recommended action level set by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Allentown has some of the highest reported levels of indoor radon in the country, yet only a small portion of the population has tested their homes. This is true particularly among self-identified Hispanics, who make up nearly half of the city's population. This study seeks to (1) characterize the difference in testing rates between self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics in Allentown, (2) quantify the level of radon awareness and knowledge, (3) identify potential obstacles to radon testing among the Allentown population that self-identifies as Hispanic, and (4) determine whether more effective risk communication is needed. Method(s): Radon test results in Allentown were analyzed to better understand the nature of radon testing. To evaluate radon awareness and knowledge, a cross-sectional study was conducted using a face-to-face survey. This data was informative in assessing testing and mitigation practices, ethnicity, income level, age, education level, homeowner status, zip code and primary language. Result(s): Ethnicity was an independent predictor of radon awareness and knowledge. Statistically significant differences were found between the number of self-identified Hispanics (39%) and non-Hispanics (84%) who indicated that they had ever heard of radon; 13% of Hispanics and 49% of non-Hispanics knew that they lived in an area with typically high radon levels. There was a statistically significant association between self-reported ethnicity and radon testing with non-Hispanics (43%) more likely to test their homes for radon than Hispanics (32%). Conclusion(s): Individual and community understanding of the risks of exposure to radiation sources such as radon is dependent upon communication that informs and spurs appropriate action. This study demonstrates the need for culturally appropriate radon risk communication strategies targeted to a Hispanic population. Successful communication will raise awareness and knowledge that can lead to better public health protection.© 2020, Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded,0.62802285

The following indices were used for the evaluation of the basal status of the body: oxygen consumption level, body mass increase rate, the level of water and basal metabolism, peripheral blood indices, body temperature, basal indices of the functional adrenocortical activity, the state of the cardiovascular system. The following non-radiation stress-exposures were used: physical exercise, constant magnetic field, starvation, hypoxia, and adrenaline administration. A V-type dependency was established for most investigated indices of the basal status and reaction of the body to non-radiation exposures. The utmost radioresistance was shown by animals in whom the basal indices or their reaction to non-radiation exposure approximated the average group level. The third direction: comparison of radiosensitivity and radiation damage--was analyzed by comparing the reaction of cerebral biocurrents to radiation exposure at a small dose with subsequent damage of the body following irradiation at a lethal dose. The accuracy of predicting the outcome of radiation injury by some of the indices varied from 65 to 80%.

The occurrence of IPE in young immunosuppressed C58 mice was systematically analyzed. When mice less than 2 weeks old were x-irradiated with 600 R, IPE could not be induced. The incidence in 1-month-old mice was approximately 50% and increased progressively with the age except for a drop in incidence at 3 months. An analysis of the dose effects of x-irradiation on the occurrence of IPE in mice of different ages revealed a marked increase in the incidence in 3- and 5-month-old mice beginning at dose levels of 450 R and 300 R, respectively. Considered together, these data indicated that two subpopulations of immunocytes differing in x-ray sensitivity interacted to protect mice from IPE. It appears that under natural conditions an x-ray sensitive cell population, possibly having suppressor function, decreased with age and made mice susceptible ot induction of IPE. Five-month-old mice were immunosuppressed with an LD10 of cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, or methotrexate to determine whether mice immunosuppressed with drugs also were susceptible to the induction of IPE. The incidence was 89%, 13%, and 5%, respectively. The mouse strain specificity of IPE induction also was studied. In 6- to 8-month-old mice suppressed with 600 R, IPE could not be induced in non-H-2k strains: BALB, C57BL/6, NZB. Of the H-2K strains tested (CBA/J, C3H/He, AKR/J, C58), the disease could be induced only in the C58 and AKR/J strains. Histopathologic studies showed that CNS lesions in immunosuppressed C58 and AKR/J mice did not differ significantly from those in old C58 mice with IPE.

Information on external gamma doses is available for virtually all of these workers; in contrast, plutonium body burden was measured only for 30% of workers. During the follow-up period in the study cohort 1,175 incident cases of chronic bronchitis were verified. The analyses of nonradiation factors revealed that the underlying risk of chronic bronchitis incidence increased with increasing attained age and was higher among smokers compared with never-smokers as would be expected. The most interesting finding in relationship to nonradiation factors was a sharp increase in the baseline chronic bronchitis risk before 1960. The cause of this is not clear but a number of factors may play a role. Based on the follow-up data after 1960, the analysis showed a statistically significant linear dose response relationship with cumulative external gamma-ray dose (ERR/Gy = 0.14, 95% CI 0.01, 0.32). Based on the same subset but with an additional restriction to members with cumulative internal lung dose below 1 Gy, a statistically significant linear dose response relationship with internal alpha-radiation lung dose from incorporated plutonium was found (ERR/Gy = 2.70, 95% CI 1.20, 4.87). In both cases, adjustment was made for nonradiation factors, including smoking and either internal or external dose as appropriate.

938,"Does mountaineering increase the incidence of cutaneous melanoma? A hypothesis based on cancer registry data Exposure to ultraviolet radiation is considered a major risk factor for the development of cutaneous melanoma. In white populations in Australia or the USA, the melanoma incidence increases with the vicinity of residence to the equator. In Europe decreasing incidence rates towards southern countries may be due to the darker pigmentation of the Mediterranean population. The comparison of age-standardized incidence rates (world standard population) in Europe shows that Swiss cancer registries and the Austrian Tyrol registry have much higher incidence rates for cutaneous melanoma than other Central European cancer registries. The excess of Swiss/Austrian incidence rates is even more pronounced when head localization is analysed separately. Due to the altitude-related increase in UV radiation two possible explanations for the Swiss/Austrian excess rates may be considered: firstly, as a result of the altitude of residence, higher UV exposure is generally present in these countries; secondly, mountaineering activities may additionally increase UV exposure.",Excluded,0.62801915
854,"Optimum fractionation in X ray treatment of C3H mouse mammary tumours The doses required to control 50% of tumors at 150 days after irradiation were determined for eight fractionated X ray schedules. The tumors were first generation transplants from spontaneous mammary tumors in C3H/He mice. The schedules were: single doses, 5, 9 or 15 fractions given daily excluding weekends, and 2, 3, 5 or 9 fractions at the two day interval known to be optimal for reoxygenation in these tumors after a priming dose of 1,500 rads. For comparison, skin reactions on the feet of albino mice were determined, using the same fractionation schedules, in order to plot the tumor control probability (TCP) against skin reactions for corresponding schedules. Two optimum schedules were found which gave maximum local control of tumors for the lowest skin reaction: nine fractions in ten days (9F/10d) and 5F/9d. The treatments given in shorter overall times were fairly good if the two day intervals were used but were poor for 'daily' doses. Both schedules employing overall times of 18 days gave poor results. The results are discussed in relation to the time course of reoxygenation and cell proliferation. A substantial difference in TCD 50 was found between male and female mice, the females being easier to cure. (16 references.)",Excluded,0.6280191
423,"Transfusion of irradiated red blood cell units with a potassium adsorption filter: A randomized controlled trial BACKGROUND: The irradiation of red blood cells (RBCs) causes damage of the RBC membrane with increased potassium (K) leak during storage compared with nonirradiated RBC units of similar age. A previous in vitro study showed a mean reduction of K of 94 +/- 5% with a potassium adsorption filter (PAF)., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective, single-center, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transfusing irradiated RBC units with the PAF. Patients 18 years of age or older who received irradiated RBC units due to chemotherapy-induced anemia were randomly assigned to receive irradiated RBC units with the PAF (PAF group) or with the standard blood infusion set (control group). Primary outcome measures were safety and efficacy of the PAF (absolute change in hemoglobin [Hb] and K, respectively, in patient's blood values after transfusing the irradiated RBC units with or without the PAF)., RESULTS: A total of 63 irradiated RBC units were transfused to 17 patients in the control group, and a total of 56 irradiated RBC units were transfused to 13 patients in the PAF group. The absolute change of Hb (9.3 +/- 6.3 g/L vs. 8.1 +/- 5.8 g/L; p = 0.3) and the absolute change of K (-0.01 +/- 0.4 mmol/L vs. -0.01 +/- 0.3 mmol/L; p = 0.2) were comparable between the two groups of the trial., CONCLUSION: The transfusion of 1 irradiated RBC unit with the PAF was as safe and efficacious as the transfusion of 1 irradiated RBC unit with the standard blood infusion set in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia.

We also investigated the possibility of expanding ex vivo the residual progenitors exposed to different dose levels of TBI., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight patients treated for AML (n = 3) and myeloma (n = 5) were included. BM and PB samples were harvested before TBI and after doses of: 5 Gy. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were assayed for burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), granulocyte-forming unit macrophage (CFU-GM), and long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-ICs). Ex vivo expansion: MNCs (after irradiation and controls) were suspended in long-term cultures and expanded with a combination of five cytokines., RESULTS: CD34+ cells were detectable at 10 Gy. We observed a significant decrease of CFU-GM and BFU-E, respectively, to 13.5% and 8.5% of baseline values for doses <or=2 Gy and to 8.2% and 4.6% for doses ranging between 2.1 and 5 Gy. No dose effect was observed for residual MNCs. LTC-ICs were not detectable after 0.8 Gy. The expansion was not successful after 1.2 Gy., CONCLUSION: This study confirms the significant decrease of human mature and immature progenitors in BM and PB immediately after low-dose TBI. In addition, the lack of expansion suggests that autografting using BM or PB residual stem cells collected and expanded in vitro in case of accidental whole body exposure may be impractical.",Excluded,0.62801695
332,"Preclinical evaluation of pions in vivo: experience at TRIUMF This paper describes the results obtained from in vivo studies of the pion beam at the TRI University Meson Facility (TRIUMF). The studies encompass work (from 1978 to 1986), designed to evaluate the RBE for early and late effects and to assess the importance of X-ray dose rate and treatment volume on these values. Results with early responding tissues, i.e. mouse and pig skin and mouse intestine indicate a pion RBE of about 1.5 in the clinically relevant dose per fraction range of 2-3 Gy. At these doses, RBE appears to be independent of the reference X-ray dose rate. However, at high doses per fraction, the RBE values become increasingly X-ray dose rate dependent. The induction of late effects by pions has been assessed by monitoring the late dermal response of pig skin; late fibrosis was not assessed in this study. The values obtained using the chosen endpoint indicate that the RBE is not significantly higher than that seen in any of the early responding tissues for pion doses as low as 2-3 Gy per fraction. The effect of increasing the treatment volume for pion therapy has been assessed using mouse intestine. The results show that for a constant field size, RBE decreases with increasing peak width. However, if peak width is held constant and field size increased, there is evidence for an increased RBE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded,0.62801653
842,"Pooled bayesian analysis of twenty-eight studies on radon induced lung cancers The influence of ionizing radiation of Rn and its progeny on lung cancer risks that were published in 28 papers was re-analyzed using seven alternative dose-response models. The risks of incidence and mortality were studied in two ranges of low annual radiation dose: 0-70 mSv per year (391 Bq m) and 0-150 mSv per year (838 Bq m). Assumption-free Bayesian statistical methods were used. The analytical results demonstrate that the published incidence and mortality data do not show that radiation dose is associated with increased risk in this range of doses. This conclusion is based on the observation that the model assuming no dependence of the lung cancer induction on the radiation doses is at least ~90 times more likely to be true than the other models tested, including the linear no-threshold (LNT) model.

853,"Dramatic and prolonged decrease of whole salivary secretion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy Objectives. This study evaluates: (1) the change in whole salivary secretion rates of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients before, during, and after radiotherapy, especially during the first week of irradiation; (2) the recovery capability of salivary glands up to 2 years postirradiation; and (3) the possible prognostic factors affecting salivary gland functions. Study design. Fifty patients who completed conventional radiotherapy using either once-per-day or hyperfractionated technique were included. Both unstimulated and stimulated whole salivary flow rates and ratios (flow rate compared with baseline) were measured before, during, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years after radiotherapy. Multivariate analysis of potential prognostic factors affecting the salivary secretion ratio was made. Results. Salivary glands were very radiosensitive and responded to radiation very early. After 720 cGy at the fourth day of the 8-week treatment, the unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates had decreased by 40%-50%. The nadir was reached in many patients after 3600 cGy (4 weeks). A second phase of decrease in salivary secretion was noted after completion of radiotherapy. Conclusions. Different mechanisms may be responsible for salivary response after low and high dose of radiation. This study shows no recovery of salivary secretion during the follow-up period, and the best strategy for managing radiation-induced salivary gland damage may be reduction of radiation dose to the glands. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Repeated administrations of 131I delivered the same dose each time, resulting in a cumulative dose from 1-3.5 Gy in the patients who had two to seven treatments. However, the estimated dose, based on the number of chromosomal aberrations on Day 4 and, above all, from the third treatment on, was considerably lower than the real dose absorbed by the lymphocytes. This may be linked to the phenomenon of apoptosis, which results in a loss of information during the course of repeated irradiation., CONCLUSION: Both chromosomal painting and conventional cytogenetics underestimate the cumulative dose after repeated 131I treatments. A complementary test measuring apoptosis may improve the dose estimates.",Excluded,0.62801355
957,"Combined effects of glutathione S-transferase polymorphisms and thyroid cancer risk Since exposure to ionizing radiation, a risk factor for thyroid cancer, may produce genotoxins potentially eliminated by glutathione-S-transferases, we conducted a case control study to evaluate the role of the GSTM1- and GSTT1-null genotypes and GSTP1 polymorphisms in thyroid cancer. The frequency of GSTP1 Ile/Ile, GSTM1-, and GSTT1-null genotypes was increased in cancer patients when compared with control population. Considering the genotypes over-represented in thyroid cancer patients as potential risk genotypes, we carried out an odds ratio (OR) analysis considering the presence of none, one, two, or three risk genotypes. The results obtained showed that the presence of three potentially risk alleles (GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, and GSTP1 Ile/Ile) lead to a significant OR increase for all the cases, irrespective of the type of tumor (OR=2.91), for papillary (OR=3.64) but not for follicular tumors. The presence of GSTP1 Ile/Ile leads to a significant later age of tumor onset when compared with GSTP1 Ile/Val and Val/Val (P<0.05), suggesting a possible association between GSTP1 Ile/Ile and the age of disease manifestation. These results suggest that combined GST polymorphisms lead to a moderate increased risk for thyroid cancer, especially for the papillary type, and GSTP1 polymorphisms might modulate the age of onset of the disease.",Excluded,0.62801355
653,"The role of age, sex and steroid sex hormones in radiation cataractogenesis It is critical to identify and gain a better understanding of the factors that enhance or reduce the risk of cataractogenesis, to minimize the possibility of occurrence after deliberate (e.g., radiation therapy, interplanetary travel) or unintentional exposure to ionizing radiation. Both gender and age at the time of exposure have been established as key determinants of cataractogenesis induced by sparsely ionizing (low-LET) and densely ionizing (high-LET) radiation. However, animal data from several older studies are often conflicting and somewhat difficult to interpret, in that the experiments suffered from small group sizes, limited dose ranges or short periods of observation, and human data are sparse or statistical significance is sometimes limited. Steroid sex hormones (SSH) may underlie age and gender-based differences in the progression and prevalence of cataracts that otherwise occur spontaneously in humans and animal models, and may also underlie age and sex-related differences in radiation cataractogenesis. Here, we review data that have aided in our understanding of the role of age, sex and steroid sex hormones in radiation cataractogenesis. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.62801135
439,"Lung tumour induction in mice after uniform and non-uniform external thoracic X-irradiation The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of the ICRP procedure of using average tissue/organ dose in estimating carcinogenic risk. It has been suggested that highly non-uniform exposure ('hot spots') is much more carcinogenic than an equivalent dose delivered uniformly. In a series of experiments, mice were irradiated with X-rays either uniformly to the thorax or non-uniformly with 72 1-mm microbeams which irradiated approximately 20 per cent of the total lung volume. Two experiments involving uniform irradiation showed a peaked tumour incidence curve with a maximum at 5 Gy. The first 'microbeam' study also produced a pronounced peak in the dose response with a maximum tumour incidence at 1 Gy average lung dose or 5 Gy to the irradiated lung tissue. This implied the use of average tissue dose might underestimate the carcinogenic hazard of non-uniform exposure. Later, more extensive, microbeam experiments failed to replicate this finding. The results were nearly similar to those for uniform irradiation, with a slight increase in tumour incidence from 2.5-5.0 Gy average lung dose. These results imply that for these irradiation conditions the ICRP dose averaging procedure remains valid.",Excluded,0.62801117

Because differentiated thyroid cancer has a good prognosis, reduction of long-term side effects is important. This study investigated the radioprotective effects of amifostine in animals and humans receiving high- dose radioiodine therapy. Method(s): Quantitative salivary gland scintigraphy was performed in five rabbits before and up to 3 mo after high-dose radioiodine therapy applying 1 GBq 131l. Three animals received 200 mg/kg amifostine before high-dose radioiodine therapy, and two served as controls. All animals were examined histopathologically. Quantitative salivary gland scintigraphy also was performed in 17 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer before and 3 mo after high-dose radioiodine therapy with 6 GBq 131l. Eight patients were treated with 500 mg/m2 amifostine before high- dose radioiodine therapy, and nine served as controls. Result(s): In two control rabbits, high-dose radioiodine therapy significantly reduced parenchymal function by 63% and 46% in parotid and submandibular glands, respectively. In contrast, there was no significant decrease in parenchymal function in amifostine-treated animals. Histopathologically, lipomatosis was observed in control animals but was negligible in amifostine-treated animals. Similar findings were observed in differentiated thyroid cancer patients. In nine control patients, high-dose radioiodine therapy significantly (p < 0.01) reduced parenchymal function by 37% and 31% in parotid and submandibular glands, respectively. Three patients exhibited Grade I (World Health Organization) xerostomia. In contrast, there was no significant decrease in parenchymal function in amifostine-treated patients and no incidence of xerostomia.

Cytogenetic tests were conducted on 2396 healthy Hungarian individuals and cancer incidence was followed up from 1989 to 2018. Venous blood samples were obtained from the subjects and metaphases from lymphocyte cultures were prepared. We compared the CA frequencies of the various smoking (1-5; 6-10; 11-19; or 20-40 cigarettes/day) and exposure (irradiation; chemical industry; chemical research laboratory) groups. Chromatid break (p = 0.0002), total aberration (p = 0.002), and aberrant cell (p = 0.001) frequencies were higher in smokers than in non-smokers. For very heavy smokers, total CAs were significantly higher than for non-smokers (<0.001) or less intensive smokers (p = 0.003-0.0006). Intensity of smoking was a predictor of chromosomal aberrations, while duration was not. During follow-up, 177 (7.3 %) cancer cases were found. A Cox-regression model showed that subjects with cell values >=2 CAs developed cancer more frequently (hazard ratio = 1.39; 95 % CI, 1.02-1.90). The relative risks of cancer were 1.06 (95 % CI 0.53-2.06) for light smokers and 1.74 (95 % CI 1.08-2.77) for very heavy smokers. The distributions of cancer sites showed differences between smoker and non-smoker groups: in male smokers, lung cancer, in non-smokers, prostate, and in females (both groups) breast cancer were most common. Cancer incidence correlated with chromosome aberrations; smoking was not a confounder in this relationship.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.6280089

748,"Radio-resistant recipient bone marrow (BM) macrophages (MACS) are necessary for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftment post transplantation For decades it has been assumed that lethal irradiation in bone marrow transplantation experiments ablates the entire host hematopoietic system but preserves the host non-hematopoietic bone marrow stroma. This postulate is at the basis of transplantation chimera experiments in mice to test involvement of hematopoietic cells versus non-hematopoietic stroma. As BM-Macs support HSC niche homeostasis, we examined whether host-derived BM-Macs persist lethal irradiation and play a role in HSC engraftment. Recipient MacGreen mice (expressing GFP in myeloid cells under the control of Csf1r promoter) were lethally irradiated (11.5Gy) and transplanted with sorted syngeneic B6.SJL CD45.1+ Lin-Kit+Sca1+ sorted cells. Flow cytometry analyses of BM 2-30 weeks (wk) post-transplant confirmed more than 99% donor chimerism of monocytes and granulocytes validating ablation of recipient HSC. In contrast, GFP+CD11b+F4/80+CD169+VCAM-1+ERHR3+Ly6Gneg recipient BM-Macs were detected throughout the time-course. A 5.9 fold expansion of these recipient BM-Macs occurred between wk 2 and 5 (from 45,000 to 270,000 cells/femur) post-transplant which coincided with increased number of phenotypic donor HSC (GFP-Lin-Kit+Sca1+CD48-CD150+). Host BM-Mac proliferation was cell autonomous in the absence of host HSC and granulocytes. Recipient Macs in spleen displayed different frequency and longevity kinetics that correlated with transient post-Tx splenic extramedullary haematopoiesis. In situ, GFP+F480+ recipient BM-Macs were enriched in perivascular microenvironments within both central BM and endosteal regions. These GFP+ host-derived macrophages persisted long-term forming 8.4% of BM macrophages 7months post-transplant. To evaluate the importance of these host-derived radiation-resistant macrophages, we selectively depleted recipient BM-Macs using CD169-DTR mice transplanted with syngeneic ubiquitous GFP+ HSC. Depletion of recipient CD169+ Macs abated engraftment of donor phenotypic HSC by 70% at 5 wk post-transplant and reduced BM reconstitution potential in competitive secondary transplants. In conclusion BM contains a myeloablation-resistant self-repopulating Mac subset that is necessary for efficient and/or sustained HSC BM engraftment following transplantation. Therefore interpretation of transplantation chimera experiments must take into account the persistence of this subset of host macrophages that support donor HSC engraftment.",Excluded,0.6280085

This study was undertaken to determine whether standard salivary gland scintigraphy may be used for the objective assessment of salivary gland sialogogues, in particular oral pilocarpine, in the treatment of post-radiotherapy xerostomia. Nine patients, with xerostomia following radiotherapy to the head and neck region underwent salivary gland scintigraphy with technetium-99m pertechnetate (40 MBq) both before and following 1 month of oral pilocarpine (5 mg tds). For each scan, the percentage uptake in the first 14 min, the peak uptake, time to peak uptake and the percentage of activity excreted following lemon juice stimulation were calculated. The results were correlated with the subjective response as assessed by questionnaire and visual analogue scale. We found no correlation between subjective response and any of the four scan parameters analysed. We could not identify any parameter that predicted those patients who would respond to pilocarpine. In addition, only one parameter, the percentage of activity excreted following stimulation, correlated with previous dose of radiotherapy to the gland. In conclusion, in this study salivary gland scintigraphy did not appear to correlate with or predict response to oral pilocarpine.

Both syndromes are transmitted by an autosomic dominant pattern. None of the known biomarkers are specific and/or sensitive enough to rely on their predictive values of patient's risks. A typical Swiss family was investigated on the basis of the cancer-prone family history. 21% of the family members observed over 5 generations presented one or more (30% of the cases) colo-rectal neoplasms at the age of 50. 55% of the tumors were right sided. Histologically, half of the tumors were mucinous. 30% of metachronous cancer appeared within 10 years. Polyps (1-3) and flat adenomas were associated to the lesion in 57%. Extra-colonic tumors appeared in 18% of family members and in half of the colon cancer patients. The sites of these tumors were the urinary tract, ovary, small bowel, breast and stomach. Two fibroblast strains of affected individuals were established. No increased tetraploidy was noted. Preliminary results suggest that this two strains are rather sensitive to ionising radiation.

Photolyase (EC 4.1.99.3) is a DNA repair enzyme that reverses damage caused by exposure to UVR. We sought to investigate whether addition of photolyase enhances the protection provided by a traditional sunscreen (SS), by reducing the in vivo formation of cyclobutane-type pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and UVR-induced apoptosis in human skin. Ten volunteers (Fitzpatrick skin type II) were exposed to solar-simulated (ss) UVR at a three times minimal erythema dose for 4 consecutive days. Thirty minutes prior to each exposure, the test materials [vehicle, SS (sun protection factor 50) alone, and SS plus photolyase from Anacystis nidulans] were applied topically to three different sites. One additional site was left untreated and one received ssUVR only. Biopsy specimens were taken 72 h after the last irradiation. The amount of CPDs and the extent of apoptosis were measured by ELISA. Photolyase plus SS was superior to SS alone in reducing both the formation of CPDs and apoptotic cell death (both P<0.001). In conclusion, the addition of photolyase to a traditional SS contributes significantly to the prevention of UVR-induced DNA damage and apoptosis when applied topically to human skin.",Excluded,0.62800574
561,"Combining paratransgenesis with SIT: impact of ionizing radiation on the DNA copy number of Sodalis glossinidius in tsetse flies BACKGROUND: Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are the cyclical vectors of the causative agents of African Trypanosomosis, which has been identified as a neglected tropical disease in both humans and animals in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa. The sterile insect technique (SIT) has shown to be a powerful method to manage tsetse fly populations when used in the frame of an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) program. To date, the release of sterile males to manage tsetse fly populations has only been implemented in areas to reduce transmission of animal African Trypanosomosis (AAT). The implementation of the SIT in areas with Human African Trypanosomosis (HAT) would require additional measures to eliminate the potential risk associated with the release of sterile males that require blood meals to survive and hence, might contribute to disease transmission. Paratransgenesis offers the potential to develop tsetse flies that are refractory to trypanosome infection by modifying their associated bacteria (Sodalis glossinidius) here after referred to as Sodalis. Here we assessed the feasibility of combining the paratransgenesis approach with SIT by analyzing the impact of ionizing radiation on the copy number of Sodalis and the vectorial capacity of sterilized tsetse males., RESULTS: Adult Glossina morsitans morsitans that emerged from puparia irradiated on day 22 post larviposition did not show a significant decline in Sodalis copy number as compared with non-irradiated flies. Conversely, the Sodalis copy number was significantly reduced in adults that emerged from puparia irradiated on day 29 post larviposition and in adults irradiated on day 7 post emergence. Moreover, irradiating 22-day old puparia reduced the copy number of Wolbachia and Wigglesworthia in emerged adults as compared with non-irradiated controls, but the radiation treatment had no significant impact on the vectorial competence of the flies., CONCLUSION: Although the radiation treatment significantly reduced the copy number of some tsetse fly symbionts, the copy number of Sodalis recovered with time in flies irradiated as 22-day old puparia. This recovery offers the opportunity to combine a paratransgenesis approach - using modified Sodalis to produce males refractory to trypanosome infection - with the release of sterile males to minimize the risk of disease transmission, especially in HAT endemic areas. Moreover, irradiation did not increase the vector competence of the flies for trypanosomes.",Excluded,0.62800515
857,"Has the outlook improved for amifostine as a clinical radioprotector? UNLABELLED: Amifostine has recently been approved for clinical radiotherapy as a protector against irradiation-induced xerostomia. It is our aim to review the outlook for using amifostine as a general clinical radioprotector. Protection against X-rays is mainly obtained by the scavenging of free radicals. The degree of protection is therefore highly dependent on oxygen tension, with protection factors ranging from 1 to 3. Maximal protection is observed at physiological levels of oxygenation. A great variability in protection has also been observed between different normal tissues. Some tissue, like brain, is not protected while salivary glands and bone marrow may exhibit a three-fold increase in radiation tolerance. Amifostine is dephosphorylized to its active metabolite by a process involving alkaline phosphatase. Due to lower levels of alkaline phosphatase in tumor vessels, amifostine is marketed as a selective protector of normal tissue and not tumors. However, the preclinical investigations concerning the selectivity of amifostine are controversial and the clinical studies are sparse and do not have the power to evaluate the influence of amifostine on the therapeutic index., CONCLUSION: based on the present knowledge amifostine should only be used in experimental protocols and not in routine practice.",Excluded,0.6280047

A Sertoli cell line from mouse testis (42GPA9) was analyzed for cytoskeletal and Sex Hormone Binding Globilin (SHBG) changes by immunohistochemistry, for antioxidant content by RT-PCR and for culture medium lactate concentrations by protein chemistry. Cells were cultured for 6, 24 and 48 h on a three-dimensional Random Positioning Machine (3D-RPM); static controls (1G) were positioned on the supporting frame. At the end of each experiment, cultured cells were either fixed in paraformaldehyde or lysed and RNA-extracted or used for culture medium lactate measurements as needed. At 0G, Sertoli cytoskeleton became disorganized, microtubules fragmented and SHBG undetectable already after 24 h, with alterations worsening by 48 h. It was evident that various antioxidant systems appreciably increased during the first 24 h but significantly decreased at 48 h. No changes occurred in the 1G samples. Initially, 0G seemed to disturb antioxidant protection strategies allowing the testes to support sperm production, thus generating an aging-like state of oxidative stress. Lactate production at 0G slightly decreased after 24 h. Further experiments are needed in space to investigate upon steroidogenesis and germ cell differentiation within the testis, to rule out male infertility as a possible consequence, which could be a problem, as life expectancy increases. 2010 COSPAR.

675,"Dose, volume, and function relationships in parotid salivary glands following conformal and intensity-modulated irradiation of head and neck cancer PURPOSE: To determine the relationships between the three-dimensional dose distributions in parotid glands and their saliva production, and to find the doses and irradiated volumes that permit preservation of the salivary flow following irradiation (RT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-eight patients with head and neck cancer irradiated with parotid-sparing conformal and multisegmental intensity modulation techniques between March 1994 and August 1997 participated in the study. The mean dose and the partial volumes receiving specified doses were determined for each gland from dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Nonstimulated and stimulated saliva flow rates were selectively measured from each parotid gland before RT and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the completion of RT. The data were fit using a generalized linear model and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model of Lyman-Kutcher. In the latter model, a ""severe complication"" was defined as salivary flow rate reduced to < or =25% pre-RT flow at 12 months., RESULTS: Saliva flow rates data were available for 152 parotid glands. Glands receiving a mean dose below or equal to a threshold (24 Gy for the unstimulated and 26 Gy for the stimulated saliva) showed substantial preservation of the flow rates following RT and continued to improve over time (to median 76% and 114% of pre-RT for the unstimulated and stimulated flow rates, respectively, at 12 months). In contrast, most glands receiving a mean dose higher than the threshold produced little saliva with no recovery over time. The output was not found to decrease as mean dose increased, as long as the threshold dose was not reached. Similarly, partial volume thresholds were found: 67%, 45%, and 24% gland volumes receiving more than 15 Gy, 30 Gy, and 45 Gy, respectively. The partial volume thresholds correlated highly with the mean dose and did not add significantly to a model predicting the saliva flow rate from the mean dose and the time since RT. The NTCP model parameters were found to be TD50 (the tolerance dose for 50% complications rate for whole organ irradiated uniformly) = 28.4 Gy, n (volume dependence parameter) = 1, and m (the slope of the dose/response relationship) = 0.18. Clinical factors including age, gender, pre-RT surgery, chemotherapy, and certain medical conditions were not found to be significantly associated with the salivary flow rates. Medications (diuretics, antidepressants, and narcotics) were found to adversely affect the unstimulated but not the stimulated flow rates., CONCLUSIONS: Dose/volume/function relationships in the parotid glands are characterized by dose and volume thresholds, steep dose/response relationships when the thresholds are reached, and a maximal volume dependence parameter in the NTCP model. A parotid gland mean dose of < or =26 Gy should be a planning goal if substantial sparing of the gland function is desired.",Excluded,0.6280042
355,"Protective Effects of Magnesium Sulfate on Radiation Induced Brain Injury in Rats OBJECTIVES: The effect of magnesium sulfate on brain tissue of SD rats irradiated by 6MeV electron was investigated., METHODS: SD rats were divided into three groups: control group, irradiation (IR group) and irradiation treated with magnesium sulfate (IR+M group). After being anesthetized, the whole brains of IR group and IR+M group were exposed to 6 MeV electron radiation. IR+M group was i.p. injected with 10% magnesium sulfate (400 mg/kg) one day before radiation and three days and five days after radiation. And on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th day after radiation, SD rats were euthanatized to take brain tissue for the detection of calcium, redox status and cell apoptosis, as well as the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1., RESULTS: The results indicated that magnesium treatment may alleviate the elevation of calcium and enhance redox status through increasing the activities of superoxide dimutase (SOD) and myeloperodase (MPO), and decreasing the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). Tunnel and immunohistochemistry assay suggested that treatment with magnesium decreased the apoptosis rate of brain cells and the expressions of caspase-3, respectively. Decline of the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 protein was observed after the treatment of magnesium., CONCLUSION: All the results demonstrated that magnesium may elicit protective effect against radiationinduced brain injury by reducing calcium overload, improving redox and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Moreover, magnesium significantly down-regulated the protein or mRNA levels of NF-kappaB and ICAM- 1. The findings may provide references for the application of magnesium in clinic for brain injury induced by radiation.

1061,"Development and evaluation of solid lipid nanoparticles of n-6-furfuryl adenine for prevention of photoaging N-6-furfuryl adenine (N6FA) also known as ""kinetin"" is a biologically active natural phytochemical. It belongs to the category of cytokinins, the natural plant growth hormones that promote cell division and play role in cell differentiation. Overall, N6FA aids in increasing the plant's life span. Human cells also contain small quantities of N6FA. Scientists are trying to understand its function in humans. N6FA is being investigated for its properties such as antiplatelet, antioxidant, antiproliferative and anti-aging effects on human cells. The aim of the present investigation was to prepare solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) based topical formulations of N6FA and to evaluate its efficacy against ultraviolet (UV) radiation induced skin photodamage. SLNs were prepared by hot microemulsion technique and optimized for the type and concentration of lipid and surfactant(s). The optimized SLN formulation was characterized in terms of particle size, drug entrapment efficiency, zeta potential and pH; evaluated for stability, spreadability, ex-vivo skin permeation and photoprotective effects against UV induced skin damage. The cumulative amount of drug permeated through mice skin using SLNs was 3 folds higher than from conventional cream base. The results of biochemical and histopathological investigations of skin treated with N6FA loaded SLNs clearly demonstrated the efficacy of optimized formulation in preventing photodamage (lesions, ulcers and changes in skin integrity) due to chronic UV exposure. The effects were comparable with widely used marketed formulation, Garnier wrinkle lift anti-aging cream. Results suggested that N6FA incorporated into SLNs may provide therapeutic as well as cosmeceutical benefits.Copyright © 2015 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.6280031
670,"Cancer risk estimation of genotoxic chemicals based on target dose and a multiplicative model A mechanistic model and associated procedures are proposed for cancer risk assessment of genotoxic chemicals. As previously shown for ionizing radiation, a linear multiplicative model was found to be compatible with published experimental data for ethylene oxide, acrylamide, and butadiene. The validity of this model was anticipated in view of the multiplicative interaction of mutation with inherited and acquired growth-promoting conditions. Concurrent analysis led to rejection of an additive model (i.e. the model commonly applied for cancer risk assessment). A reanalysis of data for radiogenic cancer in mouse, dog and man shows that the relative risk coefficient is approximately the same (0.4 to 0.5 percent per rad) for tumours induced in the three species. Doses in vivo, defined as the time- integrated concentrations of ultimate mutagens, expressed in millimol x kg- 1 x h (mMh) are, like radiation doses given in Gy or rad, proportional to frequencies of potentially mutagenic events. The radiation dose equivalents of chemical doses are, calculated by multiplying chemical doses (in mMh) with the relative genotoxic potencies (in rad x mMh-1) determined in vitro. In this way the relative cancer incidence increments in rats and mice exposed to ethylene oxide were shown to be about 0.4 percent per rad-equivalent, in agreement with the data for radiogenic cancer. Our analyses suggest that values of the relative risk coefficients for genotoxic chemicals are independent of species and that relative cancer risks determined in animal tests apply also to humans. If reliable animal test data are not available, cancer risks may be estimated by the relative potency. In both cases exposure dose/target dose relationships, the latter via macromolecule adducts, should be determined.",Excluded,0.6280027

Hence in this study, genetic damage using the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay was assessed in peripheral blood leukocytes of individuals residing in the vicinity of a mobile phone base station and comparing it to that in healthy controls. The power density in the area within 300 m from the base station exceeded the permissive limits and was significantly (p = 0.000) higher compared to the area from where control samples were collected. The study participants comprised 63 persons with residences near a mobile phone tower, and 28 healthy controls matched for gender, age, alcohol drinking and occupational sub-groups. Genetic damage parameters of DNA migration length, damage frequency (DF) and damage index were significantly (p = 0.000) elevated in the sample group compared to respective values in healthy controls. The female residents (n = 25) of the sample group had significantly (p = 0.004) elevated DF than the male residents (n = 38). The linear regression analysis further revealed daily mobile phone usage, location of residence and power density as significant predictors of genetic damage. The genetic damage evident in the participants of this study needs to be addressed against future disease-risk, which in addition to neurodegenerative disorders, may lead to cancer.",Excluded,0.628002
1045,"Dose-dependent influence of genetic polymorphisms on DNA damage induced by styrene oxide, ethylene oxide and gamma-radiation Styrene oxide (SO), ethylene oxide (EO) and gamma-radiation (G) are agents with a well-described metabolism and genotoxicity. EPHX1 and GSTs play an important role in the detoxification of electrophiles and oxidative stress. Enzymes involved in base excision repair (hOGG1, XRCC1), in rejoining single strand breaks (XRCC1) and in repair of cross-links and chromosomal double strand breaks (XRCC3) might have an impact on genotoxicity as well. In this study we assessed the dose-dependent effect of genetic polymorphisms in biotransforming (EPHX (Tyr113/His113 and His139/Arg139), GSTP1 (Ile105/Val105), GSTM1 and GSTT1) and DNA repair enzymes (hOGG1 (Ser326/Cys326), XRCC1 (Arg194/Trp194, Arg280/His280, Arg399/Gln399), XRCC3 (Thr241/Met241)) on the induced genotoxicity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 20 individuals were exposed to 3 doses per agent (+control). Genotoxicity was evaluated by measuring comet tail length (TL) and micronucleus frequencies in binucleated cells (MNCB). Dose-dependent DNA damage was found for all agents and end-points, with the exception of MNCB induced by EO. Repeated measure ANOVA revealed a significant contribution of hOGG1 and XRCC3 genotypes to the inter-individual variability of TL and MNCB in cells exposed to EO and G. Homozygous hOGG1326 wild cells showed significantly lower EO-induced TL than the heterozygous cells. Significantly higher TL and MNCB were found in EO-exposed cells carrying the XRCC3(241)Met variant and the influence on TL was more pronounced at higher dose. In G-irradiated cells, TL was significantly higher in the hOGG1326 homozygous wild types compared with mutated genotypes. The influence of hOGG1326 on TL was borderline dose-dependent. We conclude that the influence of genetic polymorphisms of enzymes involved in DNA repair on induced genotoxicity depends on exposure dose.",Excluded,0.6280015
1083,"Radioprotective effect of sulfasalazine on mouse bone marrow chromosomes Sulfasalazine (SAZ), a prescribed drug for inflammatory bowel disease, is a potent scavenger of reactive oxygen species. The present study was undertaken to ascertain its ability to protect against gamma radiation-induced damage. Acute toxicity of the drug was studied taking 24-h, 72-h and 30-day mortality after a single intraperitoneal injection of 400-1200 mg/kg body weight (b.wt.) of the drug. The drug LD(50) for 24- and 72-h/30-day survival were found to be 933 and 676 mg/kg b.wt., respectively. The optimum time of drug administration and drug dose-dependent effect on in vivo radiation protection of bone marrow chromosomes was studied in mice. Injection of 30-180 mg/kg SAZ 30 min before gamma irradiation (RT) with 4 Gy produced a significant dose-dependent reduction in the RT-induced percent aberrant metaphases and in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes at 24 h after exposure, with a corresponding decrease in the different types of aberrations. The optimum dose for protection without drug toxicity was 120 mg/kg b.wt. At this dose, SAZ produced >60% reduction in the RT-induced percent aberrant metaphases and micronucleated erythrocytes. SAZ also produced a significant increase in the ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes to normochromatic erythrocytes from that of irradiated control. Injection of 120 mg/kg of the drug 60 or 30 min before or within 15 min after 4 Gy whole-body RT resulted in a significant decrease in the percent of aberrant metaphases and in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes at 24 h post-irradiation; the maximum effect was seen when the drug was administered 30 min before irradiation. These results show that SAZ protect mice against RT-induced chromosomal damage and cell cycle progression delay. SAZ also protected plasmid DNA (pGEM-7Zf) against Fenton's reactant-induced breaks, suggesting free radical scavenging as one of the possible mechanism for radiation protection.",Excluded,0.62800103
540,"XPA-deficiency in hairless mice causes a shift in skin tumor types and mutational target genes after exposure to low doses of U.V.B Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients with a defect in the nucleotide excision repair gene XPA, develop tumors with a high frequency on sun-exposed areas of the skin. Here we describe that hairless XPA-deficient mice also develop skin tumors with a short latency time and a 100% prevalence after daily exposure to low doses of U.V.B. Surprisingly and in contrast to U.V.B.-exposed repair proficient hairless mice who mainly develop squamous cell carcinomas, the XPA-deficient mice developed papillomas with a high frequency (31%) at a U.V. dose of 32 J/m2 daily. At the highest daily dose of 80 J/m2 mainly squamous cell carcinomas (56%) and only 10% of papillomas were found in XPA-deficient hairless mice. p53 gene mutations were examined in exons 5, 7 and 8 and were detected in only 3 out of 37 of these skin tumors, whereas in tumors of control U.V.B.-irradiated wild type littermates this frequency was higher (45%) and more in line with our previous data. Strikingly, a high incidence of activating ras gene mutations were observed in U.V.B.-induced papillomas (in 11 out of 14 tumors analysed). In only two out of 14 squamous cell carcinomas we found similar ras gene mutations. The observed shift from squamous cell carcinomas in wild type hairless mice to papillomas in XPA-deficient hairless mice, and a corresponding shift in mutated cancer genes in these tumors, provide new clues on the pathogenesis of chemically- versus U.V.B.-induced skin carcinogenesis.",Excluded,0.6280008
56,"Biodosimetry for high dose accidental exposures by drug induced premature chromosome condensation (PCC) assay The conventional dicentric assay does not provide an accurate dose estimate in the case of accidental exposure to ionizing radiation above 6 Gy due to mitotic delay and poor mitotic index. The present study aims to establish a simple and rapid dose assessment technique based on scoring of rings and fragments in PCC spreads of stimulated lymphocytes. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were gamma irradiated to different doses (6.2-24.5 Gy), cultured for two days with PHA and were forced to condense prematurely using 500 nM Okadaic acid (OA). The chromosome spreads were prepared, stained with Giemsa and observed under a microscope. The PCC index, PCC rings, and PCC fragments were scored for each dose point to arrive at the dose effect curve for various end points such as induction of rings and fragments and dicentrics. The PCC index varied from 12-18% up to 18 Gy and thereafter dropped to 6-8% at higher doses. The dose dependent increase in rings and fragments was found to be linear with a slope of 0.054+/-0.001 Gy(-1) for rings and 0.45+/-0.03 Gy(-1) for PCC fragments. An experiment was carried out to simulate partial-body exposure by mixing 10 Gy in vitro irradiated blood with un-irradiated blood in different proportions. The ratio of frequency of damaged cells among the total number of cells analyzed was found to be a good index of partial-body exposure. The culture duration was extended to 72 h to overcome the cell cycle delay induced by high doses of radiation. The conventional dicentrics rings and fragments also showed a dose response at high doses. The response can be best fitted to a linear model with a slope of 0.28+/-0.0007 Gy(-1) for the induction of dicentrics. However, long culture duration, technical skill and time required to analyse multi-aberrant cells makes the dicentric assay less suitable for high dose exposures requiring a rapid dose estimate. The PCC assay can be performed in 50 h with biodosimetric information about the irradiated fraction in cases of acute radiation exposures. The automated finding of PCC spreads significantly increased the speed of scoring PCC fragments. Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.62800074

Premalignant skin lesions are seen very much earlier in white skinned populations exposed to excessive sunlight, and over time these same individuals develop larger numbers of all of the three major skin cancers than individuals who do not experience excessive UV exposure. These three skin cancers are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and malignant melanoma. In the case of SCC the major aetiological pattern is chronic long-term exposure, but for BCCs the pattern appears to be slightly different with short-term burning episodes being more important. In the case of melanomas, there is evidence that for the 4 main types of melanomas, the pattern of excess UV exposure which is most injurious varies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

669,"A specific melon concentrate exhibits photoprotective effects from antioxidant activity in healthy adults Skin is the largest body organ and the first barrier to exogenous threats. This organ is constantly exposed to external factors such as ultraviolet radiation, which induces many adverse effects including sunburn, depigmentation, photo aging, photo immune suppression, and even skin cancer. Antioxidants seem to be good candidates in order to reduce ultraviolet-mediated damages and to prevent the health consequences of ultraviolet exposure. The present investigation aims to further characterize the potential skin photoprotective effects of a food supplementation and a topical administration of a melon concentrate alone or in combination. A clinical study assessing the Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) was first set up to evaluate photoprotection. Afterward, an independent in vitro study was performed on human skin explants from a donor to evaluate the effect of the melon concentrate at different levels including on the sunburn cells formation and on the endogenous antioxidant enzymes and its influence on melanin. Clinical study results demonstrate that melon concentrate application and/or supplementation increased MED. It also increased the endogenous antioxidant enzymes and reduced sunburn cells and melanin level on irradiated skin explants. Therefore, it is suggested that melon concentrate administration (oral and/or topical) could be a useful strategy for photoprotection due to its antioxidant properties.Copyright © 2018 by the authors.

365,"Early stage transplantation of bone marrow cells markedly ameliorates copper metabolism and restores liver function in a mouse model of Wilson disease Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that normal bone marrow (BM) cells transplantation can correct liver injury in a mouse model of Wilson disease (WD). However, it still remains unknown when BM cells transplantation should be administered. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential impact of normal BM cells transplantation at different stages of WD to correct liver injury in toxic milk (tx) mice. Method(s): Recipient tx mice were sublethally irradiated (5 Gy) prior to transplantation. The congenic wild-type (DL) BM cells labeled with CM-DiI were transplanted via caudal vein injection into tx mice at the early (2 months of age) or late stage (5 months of age) of WD. The same volume of saline or tx BM cells were injected as controls. The DL donor cell population, copper concentration, serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in the various groups were evaluated at 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-transplant, respectively. Result(s): The DL BM cells population was observed from 1 to 12 weeks and peaked by the 4th week in the recipient liver after transplantation. DL BM cells transplantation during the early stage significantly corrected copper accumulation, AST across the observed time points and serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity through 8 to 12 weeks in tx mice compared with those treated with saline or tx BM cells (all P < 0.05). In contrast, BM cells transplantation during the late stage only corrected AST levels from 4 to 12 weeks post-transplant and copper accumulation at 12 weeks post-transplant (all P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between the saline and tx BM cells transplantation groups across the observed time points (P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Early stage transplantation of normal BM cells is better than late stage transplantation in correcting liver function and copper metabolism in a mouse model of WD. © 2011 Chen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded,0.6280001

181,"Relationships between nasopharyngeal carcinoma and radioactive elements in soils in China Earlier comparisons of epidemiological and geochemical maps of China disclosed associations between high mortality rates from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and low contents of magnesium in the soil. More recent work has shown that high rates of NPC are also associated with high levels of uranium and thorium in the soil. These latest findings are consistent with the earlier ones, since uranium and thorium occur predominantly in acid rocks poor in magnesium. Uranium and thorium are radioactive, and their progeny include radioactive elements such as radium and radon. Whether or not naturally occurring radioactive elements could be risk factors in NPC should, therefore, be further investigated. Direct carcinogenic properties of radon are well known, but in connection with NPC possibilities for reactivation of virus by natural ionizing radiation should also be considered.

194,"Evidence for variation in human radiosensitivity and its potential impact on radiological protection Radiological protection standards generally assume that all members of the population are equally sensitive to the adverse health effects associated with radiation exposure, recognising the age- and sex-related differences in sensitivity to radiation-induced cancer. It has become very clear over recent years that genetic and lifestyle factors can play important roles in the susceptibility of individuals to a range of diseases; as such, the same may apply to radiation-associated diseases. Evidence is accumulating from studies at many levels of biological organisation - cells, experimental organisms, and humans - that a range of radiosensitivity exists between individuals in the population. Consideration of improvements in radiological protection practices to take account of such differences will require the availability of robust and accurate ways to assess the sensitivity of an individual or population subgroup. In addition, there will need to be careful consideration of the ethical aspects relating to use of individual sensitivity information. These ethical considerations are very likely to be exposure context dependent, and require careful risk-benefit balance consideration before practical application.

Mutations of Lig4 are exclusively hypomorphic and have only been described in six patients, four exhibiting mild immunodeficiency associated with microcephaly and developmental delay, while two patient had leukemia. Here we report a SCID associated with microcephaly caused by compound heterozygous hypomorphic mutations in Lig4. Residual activity of Lig4 in these patients is underscored by a normal pattern of TCR-alpha and -beta junctions in the T cells of the patients and a moderate impairment of V(D)J recombination as tested in vitro.

361,"BMI1-KLF4 axis deficiency improves responses to neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer Purpose: Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is a gold standard treatment for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI1) is a member of the polycomb group of proteins that are involved in regulating gene expression. High levels of BMI1 have been demonstrated to contribute to the malignant phenotypes of several cancers; however, its relevance in rectal cancer treated with CCRT is largely unknown. Methods and materials: We used two patient cohorts to address the clinical relevance of BMI1 in human cancers. In addition, HT-29 and HCT-116 cells were chosen as our in vitro models to verify the role of BMI1 in cell response to ionizing radiation. Stemness-related proteins were analyzed by western blotting and cell survival was determined using clonogenic assays. Result(s): BMI1 overexpression was found to significantly correlate with advanced pre-treatment nodal status (N1-N2; p < 0.001), post-treatment tumor stage (T1-T2; p = 0.015), inferior tumor regression grade (p = 0.001), and also an independent prognosis factor in 172 rectal cancer patients receiving CCRT. Serial cell-based functional examination indicated that BMI1 deficiency sensitized cells to radiation treatment by modulating the gene expression of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and enhanced radiosensitivity in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancers. Overexpression of KLF4 partially overcame BMI1-deficiency-mediated gamma-H2AX expression after ionizing radiation exposure. Consistent with in vitro data, an analysis of an additional 30 rectal cancer tissue specimens revealed a positive correlation between BMI1 and KLF4 (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Higher levels of BMI1 are associated with poor therapeutic response and adverse outcomes in rectal cancer patients receiving CCRT.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.62799674
1137,"Evaluation of the reticulocyte micronucleus assay in patients treated with radioiodine for thyroid cancer In the case of accidental radiation exposure, biological dosimetry has an important role. Previous studies have indicated that the flow cytometric micronucleus (MN) assay in human transferrin receptor positive reticulocytes (Tf-Ret) in blood could be a sensitive biomarker for chromosome damage. In the present investigation, the utility and sensitivity of this method was studied in 44 young patients from Belarus, who were treated with 131I for thyroid cancer. Red marrow (RM) is the critical organ in radioiodine therapy (RIT). In our patients, it was exposed to 100-700 mSv low-dose rate irradiation within 2-4 days. About 3 days after 131I administration, the frequency of micronucleated-Tf-Ret (f(MN-Tf-Ret)) increases within 1 day to a maximum and declines in the following 2-5 days to its value before treatment. A total dose of 100 mSv was easily detectable. The sensitivity of the assay after acute irradiation may be 50 mSv. The method should be useful for monitoring individuals after a radiation accident, provided blood samples can be obtained within a few days after exposure. The time-course of f(MN-Tf-Ret) is interpreted using a model, which considers the exponential exposure of red marrow in RIT as well as the kinetics of erythroblast maturation and reticulocyte migration into the peripheral circulation. Similar modelling was done on published data of MN in immature mouse erythrocytes. Striking similarities in the kinetic and in the yield of MN-induction were found between these two species.

In the present study, seven patients with psoriasis ingested 400 mug of sodium selenite daily during a 4 week course of whole-body narrow-band UVB (TL01) therapy while six more psoriasis patients, similarly irradiated, ingested a placebo. Skin biopsies, collected at the start and end of the phototherapy were analysed for phosphorylated p53, Fas, Bcl-2, Bax and oxidized guaninosine, and for numbers of Langerhans and sunburn cells. Following the TL01 therapy, no significant difference was observed for any of these markers when the Se group was compared with the placebo group of patients, although p53 and Bcl-2 expression decreased in the Se supplemented group. © 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.",Excluded,0.62799567
448,"Loss of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 causes increased tumour latency in p53-deficient mice PARP-1-deficient mice display a severe defect in the base excision repair pathway leading to radiosensitivity and genomic instability. They are protected against necrosis induced by massive oxidative stress in various inflammatory processes. Mice lacking p53 are highly predisposed to malignancy resulting from defective cell cycle checkpoints, resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis as well as from upregulation of the iNOS gene resulting in chronic oxidative stress. Here, we report the generation of doubly null mutant mice. We found that tumour-free survival of parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice increased by 50% compared with that of parp- 1(+/+)p53(-/-) mice. Tumour formation in nude mice injected with oncogenic parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) fibroblasts was significantly delayed compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) cells. Upon gamma-irradiation, a partial restoration of S-phase radiosensitivity was found in parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) primary fibroblasts compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) cells. In addition, iNOS expression and nitrite release were dramatically reduced in the parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) mice. The abrogation of the oxydated status of p53(-/-) cells, due to the absence of parp-1, may be the cause of the delay in the onset of tumorigenesis in parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice.",Excluded,0.6279934
731,"Occupational cancer in central European countries The countries of central Europe, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, suffer from environmental and occupational health problems created during the political system in place until the late 1980s. This situation is reflected by data on workplace exposure to hazardous agents. Such data have been systematically collected in Skovakia and the Czech Republic since 1977. The data presented describe mainly the situation in the early 1990s. The number of workers exposed to risk factors at the workplace represent about 10% of the working population in Slovakia and 30% in Poland. In Slovakia in 1992 the percentage of persons exposed to chemical substances was 16.4%, to ionizing radiation 4.3%, and to carcinogens 3.3% of all workers exposed to risk factors. The total number of persons exposed to substances proven to be carcinogens in Poland was 1.3% of the employees; 2.2% were exposed to the suspected carcinogens. The incidence of all certified occupational diseases in the Slovak Republic was 53 per 100,000 insured employees in 1992. Cancers certified as occupational cancers are skin cancer caused by occupational exposure to carcinogens, lung cancer caused by ionizing radiation, and asbestosis together with lung cancer. Specific information on occupational cancers from Romania and Bulgaria was not available for this paper. It is difficult to predict a trend for future incidences of occupational cancer. Improved control technology, governmental regulatory activity to reduce exposure, surveillance of diseases and risk factors, and vigilant use of preventive measures should, however, ultimately reduce occupational cancer.",Excluded,0.6279929
42,"Dose-dependent shift of apoptotic and unaltered melanocytes into the dermis after irradiation with UVA 1 BACKGROUND: Intense UVA irradiation induces an increase in number, size and activity of intraepidermal melanocytes. The number of melanocytes and the activity of melanogenesis return to normal after cessation of irradiation., OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to clarify the mechanism of reduction of melanocytes by apoptosis to prevent an uncontrolled increase in melanocytes within the epidermis., METHODS: The position of the melanocytes before and after UVA 1 irradiation was controlled by electronmicroscopy and histochemistry using Fontana-Masson staining. The status of apoptosis was demonstrated immunohistologically by the use of p53 and bcl2., RESULTS: A dose-dependent shift of melanocytes into the corium could be demonstrated. At low irradiation doses (20 J/cm2) pendulous melanocytes protrude into the dermis without losing contact to the dermoepidermal basement membrane. Higher irradiation doses (60 J/cm2) lead to a total elimination of fibrillary degenerated, apoptotic or even morphologically intact melanocytes into the corium. Once transported into the corium, the melanocytes can be detected there for more than 4 years., CONCLUSION: This shift mechanism seems to regulate and control UV-induced proliferation of epidermal melanocytes.",Excluded,0.62799287
714,"An ecological study of cancer incidence and radon levels in South West England To investigate the relationship of domestic radon levels and cancer, the incidence of 14 major cancers in Devon and Cornwall were examined in relation to the local radon levels. Cancer registrations for 1989-1992 were provided by the South-Western Regional Cancer Registry. The average radon levels for postcode sectors were sorted into ten categories from low (< 40 Bq/m3) to extremely high (> or = 230 Bq/m3) and age-standardised incidence rates were calculated for each radon category. The incidence rates for lung cancer, where radon has been claimed to be a risk factor, were very similar across all domestic radon categories. Only non-melanoma skin cancers, showed a significant increase in incidence in the high-radon postcode sectors (> or = 100 Bq/m3) compared with the low-radon sectors (< 60 Bq/m3) and this effect was observed for both sexes. The remaining 12 cancer sites showed no significant trend in incidence rates with increasing radon concentration. There was no significant difference in corrected survival rates for any cancer site between the low- and high-radon areas.

881,"Determination of netilmicin in rat serum using high performance liquid chromatography and resonance Rayleigh scattering A method was developed for the direct determination of netilmicin in rat serum using high performance liquid chromatography and resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS). The separation was carried out on a Cl8 column with the isocratic elution of the mixture of 20 mmol/L sodium acetate aqueous solution and methanol containing 0.22% trifluoroacetic acid (92: 8, v/ v). With the molecular recognition probe of pontamine sky blue, netilmicin formed an ion-association complex and enhanced the intensity of RRS. The RRS signal was detected by a commercial fluorescence detector at 365 nm of both excitation wavelength (lambdaem) and emission wavelength (lambdaex). Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD, S/N = 3) for the netilmicin was 0. 7 mg/L. With the internal standard (IS) of tobramycin, a linear calibration curve ranged from 1. 2 mg/L to 30 mg/L was obtained. The presented method can be used for the pharmacokinetics study of netilmicin in rat serum, and can be a new choice for the determination of aminoglycoside antibiotics in biological samples.",Excluded,0.6279914
149,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor CIP2A indicates resistance to radiotherapy in rectal cancer Preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy, (C)RT, is an essential part of the treatment of rectal cancer patients, but tumor response to this therapy among patients is variable. Thus far, there are no clinical biomarkers that could be used to predict response to (C)RT or to stratify patients into different preoperative treatment groups according to their prognosis. Overexpression of cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) has been demonstrated in several cancers and is frequently associated with reduced survival. Recently, high CIP2A expression has also been indicated to contribute to radioresistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, but few studies have examined the connection between CIP2A and radiation response regarding other malignancies. We have evaluated CIP2A protein expression levels in relation to tumor regression after preoperative (C)RT and survival of rectal adenocarcinoma patients. The effects of CIP2A knockdown by siRNA on cell survival were further investigated in colorectal cancer cells exposed to radiation. Patients with low-CIP2A-expressing tumors had more frequently moderate or excellent response to long-course (C)RT than patients with high-CIP2A-expressing tumors. They also had higher 36-month disease-specific survival (DSS) rate in categorical analysis. In the multivariate analysis, low CIP2A expression level remained as an independent predictive factor for increased DSS. Suppression of CIP2A transcription by siRNA was found to sensitize colorectal cancer cells to irradiation and decrease their survival in vitro. In conclusion, these results suggest that by contributing to radiosensitivity of cancer cells, low CIP2A protein expression level associates with a favorable response to long-course (C)RT in rectal cancer patients.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

775,"[Clinical significance of low-dose CT performed for three consecutive years in diagnosis of lung nodules in coal mine workers with 20 working years] Objective: To investigate the clinical significance of low-dose CT (LDCT) in coal mine workers with relatively long working years. Methods: A total of 907 coal mine workers with >=20 working years were enrolled, among whom there were 863 male and 44 female workers with a mean age of 49.5 years. Digital radiography (DR) was performed for these workers in 2013, and LDCT was performed for three consecutive years from 2014 to 2016. Results: A total of 32 workers were found to have lung nodules by DR in 2013, while in 2014, 269 workers were found to have non-calcified lung nodules by LDCT, and there was a significant difference in the number of workers with lung nodules (chi(2)=233.73, P<0.005) . There was also a significant difference in the detection rate of nodules between the workers with different working years of dust exposure (chi(2)=6.648, P=0.00) . The male workers had a significantly higher detection rate of nodules than the female workers (chi(2)=5.690, P=0.017) . There was no significant difference in the number of nodules between workers with different types of work (chi(2)=16.985, P=0.05) . There were 443 lung nodules in total, among which 71.56% were solid nodules and 55.75% had a size of <=4mm; malignant nodules were confirmed by surgery in 6 (0.66%) of the 907 workers after baseline LDCT. LDCT reexamination in 2015 and 2016 found new nodules in 8 workers and enlarged nodules in 3 workers, and there was no significant change in the number of nodules with a size of <=4 mm. Conclusions: It is necessary to perform high-risk population screening for coal mine workers by LDCT. The follow-up strategies for nodules with a size of <=4mm are the same as those for negative results; annual reexamination is recommended for nodules with a size of >4-8 mm, and clinical treatment should be considered for nodules with a size of >8 mm.",Excluded,0.62799066

362,"Super-enhancers modulate interleukin-6 expression and function in cancers Background: It is widely accepted that inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 6 (IL-6), was not only elevated in cancer but also important in carcinogenesis. But how did IL-6 be produced in tumor microenvironment remains to be addressed. Method(s): Both bioinformatics tools and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to examine the expression of IL-6 in cancer cells. To map super-enhancers of IL-6, sgRNAs were constructed. Stable knockout cells were established and subsequently used for cell proliferation and colony formation assay. The correlation between mapped super-enhancers and IL-6 expression was studied by ATAC-seq analysis. Result(s): The expression of IL-6 was high in multiple cancers, including pancreatic cancer (PAAD). The elevated expression of IL-6 in PAAD was further confirmed by transcriptional data and in a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines (one immortal HPDE6-C7 cell line and four PDAC cell lines: BxPC-3, PANC-1, AsPC-1 and CFPAC-1). When treated with JQ-1 and I-BET-762, two inhibitors of super-enhancers, the expression of IL-6 in multiple cancer cells including CFPAC-1, HeLa and SUM-159 cells was significantly reduced. By analyzing the H3K27Ac profiling, BRD4 binding, Med1 binding and DNA conservation in CFPAC-1, HeLa and SUM-159 cells, we identified a potential super-enhancer (IL6-SE) that might be important for IL-6 expression in cancer. The super-enhancer (IL6-SE) can be further divided into two elements (IL6-SEa and IL6-SEb). Genetic deletion of IL6-SEa in cancer cells greatly reduces the expression of IL-6. IL6-SEa deficient cells also showed low proliferation and colony formation ability. In patients, the epigenetic activation (ATAC signal) of IL6-SEa is correlated with the expression of IL-6. Conclusion(s): In summary, we not only provide convincing experimental evidence to demonstrate that IL-6 expression in cancer is dependent on super-enhancers but also identified IL6-SEa as a critical DNA regulatory element. Our findings provide new insights to understand the epigenetic regulation of IL-6 expression in cancers.Copyright © Translational Cancer Research. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.6279886
684,"A regenerative role for bone marrow following experimental colitis: Contribution to neovasculogenesis and myofibroblasts Background & Aims: Bone marrow (BM) cells form differentiated adult lineages within nonhematopoietic tissues, with a heightened propensity with increasing regenerative pressure dictated by disease. We have previously shown that BM cells engraft into the gut and contribute substantially to the subepithelial intestinal myofibroblast population in the lamina propria. To investigate the reparative capacity of BM in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a well-established model of experimental colitis was used. Method(s): Lethally irradiated female mice were rescued by a BM transplant from male donors. Colitis was induced 6 weeks posttransplantation by injection of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), and tissues were analyzed 1-14 days later. Donor-derived cells were detected by in situ hybridization using a Y chromosome-specific probe, and their phenotype was determined by immunohistochemistry. Result(s): TNBS-induced colitis was manifest as patchy lesions that increased in severity between days 1 and 8, and the mucosa gradually regenerated between days 8 and 14. The contribution of BM to intestinal myofibroblasts was significantly increased in regions of colitis compared with noninflamed regions. Furthermore, BM-derived endothelial cells, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells were frequently interspersed throughout blood vessels, suggesting that these cells facilitate angiogenesis in tissue repair, substantiated by a significant increase in the incidence of BM-derived vascular smooth muscle cells in colitic compared with noninflamed regions. Blood vessels formed entirely from BM-derived cells were also seen, suggesting a role for BM in neovasculogenesis. Conclusion(s): Our data show that BM contributes to multiple intestinal cell lineages in colitis, with an important function in tissue regeneration and vasculogenesis after injury. © 2005 by the American Gastroenterological Association.",Excluded,0.6279882
1149,"[Topical application of vitamins, phytosterols and ceramides. Protection against increased expression of interstital collagenase and reduced collagen-I expression after single exposure to UVA irradiation] Photoaged skin is characterized by a decrease of dermal collagen fibers, resulting from an increased breakdown and a diminished de novo synthesis. The increased breakdown results from an increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The main building blocks involved in de novo synthesis of collagen fibers are collagen 1A1 and 1A2, the expression of which is reduced in photoaged skin. We studied the effect of topical application of vitamins, phytosterols and ceramides on UV-induced up-regulation of the expression of MMP-1 and on UV-induced down-regulation of COL1A1 and COL1A2. The study was conducted with 10 subjects with healthy skin who were comparatively treated for 10 days with (i) a basic preparation containing jojoba oil, (ii) the basic preparation supplemented with vitamins, (iii) the basic preparation supplemented with phytosterols and ceramides, and (iv) the basic preparation supplemented with vitamins, phytosterols and ceramides. All four preparations inhibited the UV induced up-regulation of MMP-1. Neither the basic product nor that supplemented with vitamins inhibited down-regulation of COL1A1 and COL1A2, but addition of phytosterols and ceramides caused a decreased down-regulation of the expression of these genes. Our results indicate that phytosterols and ceramides are effective in blocking the reduced collagen synthesis after UV irradiation and even stimulating synthesis.

566,"Eosinophilic interleukin 5 (IL-5) transgenic mice: eosinophil activity and impaired clearance of Schistosoma mansoni Eosinophilia is a feature common to many invasive helminth infections and eosinophils are often considered to be effector cells in immunity to helminths. This study examined the possible influence of constitutive eosinophilia on the clearance of Schistosoma mansoni infections in mice. Eosinophils from interleukin-5 transgenic mice exhibit normal ultrastructure and function with regard to phagocytosis and killing of bacteria and responses to chemotactic stimuli. IL-5 transgenics and non-transgenic littermates were immunized once or four (hyperimmunization) times with irradiated cercariae of S. mansoni. Animals were challenged percutaneously with unirradiated cercariae one month after their last exposure to irradiated parasites. One month after challenge transgenic animals, whether unimmunized, vaccinated or hypervaccinated, carried significantly more liver-stage parasites than non-transgenic animals. These results suggest that although eosinophils from IL-5 transgenic mice are functional for a number of key parameters, large numbers of eosinophils and/or high levels of IL-5 may in some way impair clearance of S. mansoni. A re-evaluation of the roles of eosinophils and IL-5 in infections with this and other parasites may therefore be warranted.",Excluded,0.627988

As part of a study of this phenomenon, we also investigated apoptotic response in a series of breast cancer patients lacking TP53 mutations and in a control group of individuals without cancer. There was a significant reduction in mean apoptotic response with increasing age in all groups. These findings are consistent with a number of studies in rodents, which have demonstrated a reduction in DNA damage-induced apoptosis with increasing age. In addition, after adjusting for age, breast cancer patients showed significantly reduced apoptotic responses compared with normal controls (P=0.002). The odds ratio for breast cancer in women with an apoptotic response of <35%, compared with women with a response of >49%, was 6.42 (95% CI 1.68-24.6).

988,"Celecoxib and radioresistant glioblastoma-derived CD133+ cells: Improvement in radiotherapeutic effects. Laboratory investigation Object. Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor, has a poor prognosis, even with aggressive resection and chemoradiotherapy. Recent studies indicate that CD133+ cells play a key role in radioresistance and recurrence of glioblastoma. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, is overexpressed in a variety of tumors, including CD133+ glioblastomas. The COX-2-derived prostaglandins promote neovascularization during tumor development, and conventional radiotherapy increases the proportion of CD133+ cells rather than eradicating them. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in enhancing the therapeutic effects of radiation on CD133+ glioblastomas. Methods. Cells positive for CD133 were isolated from glioblastoma specimens and characterized by flow cytometry, then treated with celecoxib and/or ionizing radiation (IR). Clonogenic assay, cell irradiation, cell cycle analysis, Western blot, and xenotransplantation were used to assess the effects of celecoxib alone, IR alone, and IR with celecoxib on CD133+ and CD133- glioblastoma cells. Three separate xenotransplantation experiments were carried out using 310 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice: 1) an initial tumorigenicity evaluation in which 3 different quantities of untreated CD133- cells or untreated or pretreated CD133+ cells (5 treatment conditions) from 7 different tumors were injected into the striatum of 2 mice (210 mice total); 2) a tumor growth study (50 mice); and 3) a survival study (50 mice). For these last 2 studies the same 5 categories of cells were used as in the tumorigenicity (untreated CD133 - cells, untreated or pretreated CD133+ cells, with pretreatment consisting of celecoxib alone, IR alone, or IR and celecoxib), but only 1 cell source (Case 2) and quantity (5 x 104 cells) were used. Results. High levels of COX-2 protein were detected in the CD133 + but not the CD133- glioblastoma cells. The authors further demonstrated that 30 mM celecoxib was able to effectively enhance the IR effect in inhibiting colony formation and increasing IR-mediated apoptosis in celecoxib-treated CD133+ glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, reduction in radioresistance was correlated with the induction of G2/M arrest, which was partially mediated through the increase in the level of phosphorylated-cdc2. In vivo xenotransplant analysis further confirmed that CD133+-associated tumorigenicity was significantly suppressed by celecoxib treatment. Importantly, pretreatment of CD133+ glioblastoma cells with a combination of celecoxib and IR before injection into the striatum of SCID mice resulted in a statistically significant reduction in tumor growth and a statistically significant increase in the mean survival rate of the mice. Conclusions. Celecoxib combined with radiation plays a critical role in the suppression of growth of CD133+ glioblastoma stemlike cells. Celecoxib is therefore a radiosensitizing drug for clinical application in glioblastoma.",Excluded,0.627987
139,"The role of thiols in cellular response to radiation and drugs Cellular nonprotein thiols (NPSH) consist of glutathione (GSH) and other low molecular weight species such as cysteine, cysteamine, and coenzyme A. GSH is usually less than the total cellular NPSH, and with thiol reactive agents, such as diethyl maleate (DEM), its rate of depletion is in part dependent upon the cellular capacity for its resynthesis. If resynthesis is blocked by buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine(BSO), the NPSH, including GSH, is depleted more rapidly, Cellular thiol depletion by diamide, N-ethylmaleimide, and BSO may render oxygenated cells more sensitive to radiation. These cells may or may not show a reduction in the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER). Human A549 lung carcinoma cells depleted of their NPSH either by prolonged culture or by BSO treatment do not show a reduced OER but do show increased aerobic responses to radiation. Some nitroheterocyclic radiosensitizing drugs also deplete cellular thiols under aerobic conditions. Such reactivity may be the reason that they show anomalous radiation sensitization (i.e., better than predicted on the basis of electron affinity). Other nitrocompounds, such as misonidazole, are activated under hypoxic conditions to radical intermediates. When cellular thiols are depleted peroxide is formed. Under hypoxic conditions thiols are depleted because metabolically reduced intermediates react with GSH instead of oxygen. Thiol depletion, under hypoxic conditions, may be the reason that misonidazole and other nitrocompounds show an extra enhancement ratio with hypoxic cells. Thiol depletion by DEM or BSO alters the radiation response of hypoxic cells to misonidazole. In conclusion, we propose an altered thiol model which includes a mechanism for thiol involvement in the aerobic radiation response of cells. This mechanism involves both thiol-linked hydrogen donation to oxygen radical adducts to produce hydroperoxides followed by a GSH peroxidase-catalyzed reduction of the hydroperoxides to intermediates entering into metabolic pathways to produce the original molecule.",Excluded,0.6279862
611,"Use of unstable chromosome aberrations for biological dosimetry after the first postirradiation mitosis The loss of unstable chromosome aberrations after the first postirradiation mitosis makes their use difficult in radiation dosimetry. We describe here a method which, in a cell population observed at this stage, allows retrospective estimation of the frequencies of the unstable aberrations induced at the time of irradiation, and their use as a dosimeter. The laws controlling the behavior of unstable aberrations during mitosis were defined from a large-scale experiment on irradiated human lymphocytes. For cells undergoing the first, second, or third mitosis after irradiation, relationships were determined between the frequency, at irradiation time, of acentric fragments not arising from formation of dicentrics or rings, and the ratio of dicentrics and centric rings appearing without acentric fragments to the total number of dicentrics plus rings. On the basis of this ratio, the method described here provides an assessment of the postirradiation mitotic activity in a cell population. This assessment permitted estimation of the cell distribution and frequency of dicentrics plus centric rings, and of the frequency of acentric fragments at the time of irradiation. The use of this method for retrospective dosimetry after whole-body irradiation under various conditions of exposure is illustrated.",Excluded,0.62798554

Several cancer-preventive mechanisms have been proposed, such as antioxidant properties and modulation of biotransformation enzyme activities; both may be associated with reducing DNA damage and hence the mutation rate. We investigated, in a randomized, controlled, crossover feeding trial, the effect of 10 servings/day of botanically defined F&V for 2 wk on endogenous DNA damage; resistance to gamma -irradiation damage; and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes, measured by the Comet assay. We also explored the association between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and serum bilirubin concentrations and DNA damage and repair measures. Healthy men (n = 11) and women (n = 17), age 20 to 40 yr, provided blood samples at the end of each feeding period. Overall, F&V did not affect DNA damage and repair measures in lymphocytes. The number of UGT1A1*28 alleles was inversely associated with sensitivity to gamma -irradiation exposure and DNA repair capacity, but a biological mechanism to explain this association is unclear. A larger sample size is needed to investigate the association between bilirubin concentrations and endogenous DNA damage.

661,"Baseline MAPK signaling activity confers intrinsic radioresistance to KRAS-mutant colorectal carcinoma cells by rapid upregulation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) is overexpressed in malignant tumors and involved in DNA damage response upon ionizing radiation (IR). Here, we investigate its role in radioresistance of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and evaluate a pharmacological approach to enhance CRC radiosensitivity via downregulation of hnRNP K. We show that hnRNP K is overexpressed in CRC tissue specimens and upregulated in response to IR in vitro, which occurs faster in KRAS-mutant CRC cells. HnRNP K knockdown impairs cell survival, cell cycle progression and KRAS-dependent radioresistance and increases apoptosis. Using the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay, a decrease in xenograft tumor growth and radioresistance upon hnRNP K depletion could be verified in vivo, and comparable effects were achieved by suppression of hnRNP K expression using the MEK inhibitor MEK162 (Binimetinib). In summary, KRAS-mutant CRC shows intrinsic radioresistance along with rapid upregulation of hnRNP K in response to IR that can effectively be targeted by MEK inhibition. Our results point towards a possible use of MAPK pathway inhibitors to decrease radioresistance of KRAS-mutant CRC via downregulation of hnRNP K.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded,0.62797934
68,"Residential radon and lung cancer: a cohort study in Galicia, Spain Case-control studies show an association between residential radon and lung cancer. The aim of this paper is to investigate this association through a cohort study. We designed an ambispective cohort study using the Galician radon map, Spain, with controls drawn from a previous case-control study. Subjects were recruited between 2002 and 2009. The data were cross-checked to ascertain lung cancer incidence and then analysed using a Cox regression model. A total of 2,127 subjects participated; 24 lung cancer cases were identified; 76.6% of subjects were drawn from the radon map. The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.2 (95%CI: 0.5-2.8) for the category of subjects exposed to 50Bq/m3 or more. This risk rose when subjects from the case-control study were analyzed separately. In conclusion, we did not observe any statistically significant association between residential radon exposure and lung cancer; however, it appears that with a sample of greater median age (such as participants from the case-control study), the risk of lung cancer would have been higher.",Excluded,0.6279792
1095,"Innate immune responses of Drosophila melanogaster are altered by spaceflight Alterations and impairment of immune responses in humans present a health risk for space exploration missions. The molecular mechanisms underpinning innate immune defense can be confounded by the complexity of the acquired immune system of humans. Drosophila (fruit fly) innate immunity is simpler, and shares many similarities with human innate immunity at the level of molecular and genetic pathways. The goals of this study were to elucidate fundamental immune processes in Drosophila affected by spaceflight and to measure host-pathogen responses post-flight. Five containers, each containing ten female and five male fruit flies, were housed and bred on the space shuttle (average orbit altitude of 330.35 km) for 12 days and 18.5 hours. A new generation of flies was reared in microgravity. In larvae, the immune system was examined by analyzing plasmatocyte number and activity in culture. In adults, the induced immune responses were analyzed by bacterial clearance and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of selected genes following infection with E. coli. The RNA levels of relevant immune pathway genes were determined in both larvae and adults by microarray analysis. The ability of larval plasmatocytes to phagocytose E. coli in culture was attenuated following spaceflight, and in parallel, the expression of genes involved in cell maturation was downregulated. In addition, the level of constitutive expression of pattern recognition receptors and opsonins that specifically recognize bacteria, and of lysozymes, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) pathway and immune stress genes, hallmarks of humoral immunity, were also reduced in larvae. In adults, the efficiency of bacterial clearance measured in vivo following a systemic infection with E. coli post-flight, remained robust. We show that spaceflight altered both cellular and humoral immune responses in Drosophila and that the disruption occurs at multiple interacting pathways.",Excluded,0.6279782

Leukaemogenesis due to soluble 226Ra was more uncertain. Clinical expression was variable, but as a generalization the disease was a lymphosarcoma with haematogenous (leukaemic) spread. Only rarely, unlike the commonly recorded forms of natural and X-ray-induced lymphosarcomas, was the thymus apparently the site of onset. The cell-type was lymphoblastic of undifferentiated null form (not T, not B). The average doses of alpha or beta radiation accumulated in the bone-marrow, the presumed site of induction, were at the time of diagnosis usually more than 2500 rad, but, if the cases occurring after radium or low activities of plutonium are accepted as induced, 300-1500 rad of alpha radiation. Mice converted to chimaeras only rarely exhibited any lymphoma, general or local.

784,"GUCY2C signaling opposes the acute radiation-induced GI syndrome High doses of ionizing radiation induce acute damage to epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, mediating toxicities restricting the therapeutic efficacy of radiation in cancer and morbidity and mortality in nuclear disasters. No approved prophylaxis or therapy exists for these toxicities, in part reflecting an incomplete understanding of mechanisms contributing to the acute radiation-induced GI syndrome (RIGS). Guanylate cyclase C (GUCY2C) and its hormones guanylin and uroguanylin have recently emerged as one paracrine axis defending intestinal mucosal integrity against mutational, chemical, and inflammatory injury. Here, we reveal a role for the GUCY2C paracrine axis in compensatory mechanisms opposing RIGS. Eliminating GUCY2C signaling exacerbated RIGS, amplifying radiation-induced mortality, weight loss, mucosal bleeding, debilitation, and intestinal dysfunction. Durable expression of GUCY2C, guanylin, and uroguanylin mRNA and protein by intestinal epithelial cells was preserved following lethal irradiation inducing RIGS. Oral delivery of the heat-stable enterotoxin (ST), an exogenous GUCY2C ligand, opposed RIGS, a process requiring p53 activation mediated by dissociation from MDM2. In turn, p53 activation prevented cell death by selectively limiting mitotic catastrophe, but not apoptosis. These studies reveal a role for the GUCY2C paracrine hormone axis as a novel compensatory mechanism opposing RIGS, and they highlight the potential of oral GUCY2C agonists (Linzess; Trulance) to prevent and treat RIGS in cancer therapy and nuclear disasters.Copyright ©2017 AACR.",Excluded,0.6279774
1031,"Hybrid resistance to parental bone marrow grafts in nonlethally irradiated mice Resistance to parental bone marrow (BM) grafts in F1 hybrid recipients is due to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated rejection triggered through ""missing self"" recognition. ""Hybrid resistance"" has usually been investigated in lethally irradiated F1 recipients in conjunction with pharmacological activation of NK cells. Here, we investigated BM-directed NK-cell alloreactivity in settings of reduced conditioning. Nonlethally irradiated (1-3 Gy) or nonirradiated F1 (C57BL6 x BALB/c) recipient mice received titrated doses (5-20 x 106) of unseparated parental BALB/c BM without pharmacological NK cell activation. BM successfully engrafted in all mice and multilineage donor chimerism persisted long-term (24 weeks), even in the absence of irradiation. Chimerism was associated with the rearrangement of the NK-cell receptor repertoire suggestive of reduced reactivity to BALB/c. Chimerism levels were lower after transplantation with parental BALB/c than with syngeneic F1 BM, indicating partial NK-mediated rejection of parental BM. Activation of NK cells with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid sodium salt poly(I:C), reduced parental chimerism in nonirradiated BM recipients but did not prevent hematopoietic stem cell engraftment. In contrast, equal numbers of parental lymph node cells were completely rejected. Hence, hybrid resistance leads to incomplete rejection of parental BM under reduced conditioning settings.Copyright © 2018 The Authors American Journal of Transplantation published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons",Excluded,0.6279773
505,"Vitamin D improves sunburns by increasing autophagy in M2 macrophages Cutaneous inflammation from UV radiation exposure causes epidermal damage, cellular infiltration, and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators that exacerbate tissue destruction. Recovery is mediated chiefly by anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages that suppress inflammation and augment epidermal regeneration. Vitamin D enables anti-inflammation to promote tissue repair in response to injury. Since vitamin D enhances cellular macroautophagy/autophagy, we investigated the role of autophagy in vitamin D protection of UV-mediated sunburn and inflammation. Using a UV-mediated acute skin injury mouse model, we demonstrate that a single dose of vitamin D resolves injury with sustained inhibition of inflammatory cytokines associated with enhanced autophagy in myeloid anti-inflammatory M2 macs. Increased MAP1LC3B/LC3 expression corroborated with complete autolysosome formation detected by electron microscopy and correlated with degradation of SQSTM1/p62 in the skin following vitamin D treatment. Specifically, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy increased UV-induced apoptosis, suppressed M2 macs recruitment, and prevented vitamin D downregulation of Tnf and Mmp9 in the skin. Furthermore, selective deletion of autophagy in myeloid cells of atg7 cKO mice abrogated vitamin D-mediated protection and recapitulated UV-induced inflammation. Mechanistically, vitamin D signaling activated M2-autophagy regulators Klf4, Pparg, and Arg1. Lastly, analysis of UV-exposed human skin biopsies detected a similar increase in macrophage autophagy following vitamin D intervention, identifying an essential role for autophagy in vitamin D-mediated protection of skin from UV damage.

543,"Molecular and cellular profiling of acute responses to total body radiation exposure in ovariectomized female cynomolgus macaques Purpose: The threat of radiation exposure requires a mechanistic understanding of radiation-induced immune injury and recovery. The study objective was to evaluate responses to ionizing radiation in ovariectomized (surgically post-menopausal) female cynomolgus macaques. Material(s) and Method(s): Animals received a single total-body irradiation (TBI) exposure at doses of 0, 2 or 5 Gy with scheduled necropsies at 5 days, 8 weeks and 24 weeks post-exposure. Blood and lymphoid tissues were evaluated for morphologic, cellular, and molecular responses. Result(s): Irradiated animals developed symptoms of acute hematopoietic syndrome, and reductions in thymus weight, thymopoiesis, and bone marrow cellularity. Acute, transient increases in plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) were observed in 5 Gy animals along with dose-dependent alterations in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) signatures in thymus, spleen, and lymph node. Expression of T cell markers was lower in thymus and spleen, while expression of macrophage marker CD68 (cluster of differentiation 68) was relatively elevated in lymphoid tissues from irradiated animals. Conclusion(s): Ovariectomized female macaques exposed to moderate doses of radiation experienced increased morbidity, including acute, dose-dependent alterations in systemic and tissue-specific biomarkers, and increased macrophage/T cell ratios. The effects on mortality exceeded expectations based on previous studies in males, warranting further investigation.Copyright © 2015 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded,0.6279761

The heterochromatin-sensitive period has been determined in white/white-apricot variegated eyes of YSWa/Wa; Dp (1,3)W264-58 flies. When such larvae, carrying a Y-short (YS) arm at the distal end of one X chromosome, are X-rayed, mitotic recombination leads to one daughter cell with two YS arms and an adjacent daughter cell with no YS arm. When induced after clonal initiation, the frequency of dark clones developing from daughter cells with two YS arms is significantly higher than the frequency of dark clones in the rest of the eye; and this frequency is even higher when induced before clonal initiation. The modifying action of the Y-heterochromatin is exerted, therefore, during and after clonal initiation. Surprisingly, the frequency of dark clones developing from cells with no YS arm is not lower than the frequency of dark clones in the rest of the eye.",Excluded,0.627976
88,"Differential recruitment of caspase 8 to cFlip confers sensitivity or resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis in a subset of familial lymphoma patients Resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis (FMA) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hematologic malignancies. Recently, a collaborative study showed that germline Fas mutations represent a genetic risk factor for the development of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Here, we report that transformed B cell lines from familial lymphoma patients show a range of sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis with lymphocytes from two patients with a marked resistance to Fas-, but not p53-mediated cell death. Fas resistance in these cells was associated with reduced recruitment of the initiator caspase 8 compared to cFlip, an inhibitor of apoptosis, to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). A decreased ratio of caspase 8 to cFlip in total cell extracts as well as in the DISC was associated with a profound disturbance of the Fas signaling cascade. We propose here that the relative reduction in caspase 8 to cFlip in the Fas DISC confers a survival advantage to lymphocytes and predisposes to the development of malignancy in some familial lymphoma patients.",Excluded,0.62797564
1124,"Skin cancer risk perception and sun protection behavior at work, at leisure, and on sun holidays: A survey for Danish outdoor and indoor workers 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1117 Public Health and Health Services Background: To prevent occupational skin cancer, it is essential that the sun-protective behavior of outdoor workers is adequate. The aim is to study the sun-protective behavior of Danish outdoor workers at work, at leisure, and on sun holiday and compare it to that of indoor workers. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional study, based on a 53-item survey completed by Danish outdoor (n = 380) and indoor workers (n = 119) in 2016-2017. Status as outdoor or indoor worker was decided based on self-report and behavioral differences were tested using (paired) t tests and multiple regression adjusted for age, sex, educational level, history of smoking, and skin type. Result(s): Danish outdoor workers at work use sun protection less than they do at leisure and on sun holiday (alpha <.05) where their sun protection behavior is similar to that of indoor workers. The proportion of Danish outdoor workers that always/often use sun protection at work is for shade seeking around noon 4.2%, sunscreen 34.5%, wide-brimmed hat 25.3%, and long trousers and shirt with sleeves 42.4%. Of Danish outdoor workers, 49.5% do not think about the risk of occupational skin cancer and 11.8% think the risk is insignificant, 32.4% think that the use of sun protection is of low or no importance, 84.2% consider sunburn important as skin cancer risk factor still 88.9% have a history of sunburn at work, > 80.0% agree that risk of skin cancer is reduced by the use of sun protection, and only 4.0% dismiss the possibility of sun protection use at work. Conclusion(s): Skin cancer risk and use of sun protection at work are largely neglected in Danish outdoor workers, more so than at leisure and on sun holiday where their risk behavior resembles that of indoor workers. This indicates an untapped workplace preventive potential.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded,0.6279751

In cysticercosis, previous studies have shown that irradiating (with 0.3 kGy) pork infected with Taenia solium larvae completely inhibits growth of the parasite. This study was conducted to evaluate the mechanisms that induce the effect of gamma irradiation on metacestodes of T. solium. Metacestodes were obtained from several infected pigs and irradiated with a dose of 0.3 kGy. The viability of the metacestodes was evaluated by their capacity to evaginate in vitro and in vivo development to tapeworms after they were orally infected into prednisolone-treated golden hamsters. Using the typical ladder pattern of fragmented DNA and the TdT-mediated DUTP-nick-end labeling assay, apoptosis was evaluated in metacestodes after irradiation and in the scolices and tapeworms recovered from infected hamsters at 21 days post-infection. Apoptosis was observed in the structure of scolices obtained from hamsters at 21 days post-infection with irradiated metacestodes, This study provides evidence of the existence of apoptosis in the irradiated metacestodes of T. solium and helps elucidate the possible mechanisms that are involved when gamma irradiation inhibits the normal development of the T. solium metacestode into the adult worm.",Excluded,0.6279724
344,"Growth hormone mitigates against lethal irradiation and enhances hematologic and immune recovery in mice and nonhuman primates Medications that can mitigate against radiation injury are limited. In this study, we investigated the ability of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) to mitigate against radiation injury in mice and nonhuman primates. BALB/c mice were irradiated with 7.5 Gy and treated post-irradiation with rhGH intravenously at a once daily dose of 20 mug/dose for 35 days. rhGH protected 17 out of 28 mice (60.7%) from lethal irradiation while only 3 out of 28 mice (10.7%) survived in the saline control group. A shorter course of 5 days of rhGH post-irradiation produced similar results. Compared with the saline control group, treatment with rhGH on irradiated BALB/c mice significantly accelerated overall hematopoietic recovery. Specifically, the recovery of total white cells, CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets, B cells, NK cells and especially platelets post radiation exposure were significantly accelerated in the rhGH-treated mice. Moreover, treatment with rhGH increased the frequency of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells as measured by flow cytometry and colony forming unit assays in bone marrow harvested at day 14 after irradiation, suggesting the effects of rhGH are at the hematopoietic stem/progenitor level. rhGH mediated the hematopoietic effects primarily through their niches. Similar data with rhGH were also observed following 2 Gy sublethal irradiation of nonhuman primates. Our data demonstrate that rhGH promotes hematopoietic engraftment and immune recovery post the exposure of ionizing radiation and mitigates against the mortality from lethal irradiation even when administered after exposure. © 2010 Chen et al.",Excluded,0.62797225
388,"Hapten-specific IgE antibody responses in mice. VI. Selective enhancement of IgE antibody production by low doses of X-irradiation and by cyclophosphamide Exposure of BALB/c, A/J, and (BALB/c X A/J)F1 mice, which are IgE high responder animals, to total body x-irradiation ranging from 50 to 200 R resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of the hapten-specific IgE antibody level as compared to unirradiated control mice. In contrast, anti-hapten antibody responses of the IgG class in these same animals were rarely enhanced, and when so, were of a lesser degree. This relatively selective augmentation of the IgE vs IgG antibody responses was observed in both unprimed and primed mice. By utilizing adoptive transfer systems, it was demonstrated that the enhancing effects of x-irradiation resulted from its action on the carrier-primed cell population and not upon the responding B cells or upon macrophages. The data presented herein suggest that this enhancement phenomenon is the result of the elimination of T cells (or their products) with suppressive functions and that these cells are neither dependent upon nor specific for the carrier antigen employed in the immunization. This hypothesis is given indirect support by the observations that treatment of the same strains of mice with cyclophosphamide, in doses known to abrogate suppressive T cell functions, resulted in a similar enhancing effect to that observed after low doses of x-irradiation. In addition an interesting difference between IgE and IgG precursor B lymphocytes was observed by the ability of IgE B cells to differentiate to the secretory state at a strikingly more rapid rate than IgG B lymphocytes when exposed to comparable T cell helper influences. These observations may provide important clues to the cellular mechanisms of the immune regulation of the IgE response and its relationship to allergic diseases.",Excluded,0.62797153

92,"Effects of parental radiation exposure on developmental instability in grasshoppers Mutagenic and epigenetic effects of environmental stressors and their transgenerational consequences are of interest to evolutionary biologists because they can amplify natural genetic variation. We studied the effect of parental exposure to radioactive contamination on offspring development in lesser marsh grasshopper Chorthippus albomarginatus. We used a geometric morphometric approach to measure fluctuating asymmetry (FA), wing shape and wing size. We measured time to sexual maturity to check whether parental exposure to radiation influenced offspring developmental trajectory and tested effects of radiation on hatching success and parental fecundity. Wings were larger in early maturing individuals born to parents from high radiation sites compared to early maturing individuals from low radiation sites. As time to sexual maturity increased, wing size decreased but more sharply in individuals from high radiation sites. Radiation exposure did not significantly affect FA or shape in wings nor did it significantly affect hatching success and fecundity. Overall, parental radiation exposure can adversely affect offspring development and fitness depending on developmental trajectories although the cause of this effect remains unclear. We suggest more direct measures of fitness and the inclusion of replication in future studies to help further our understanding of the relationship between developmental instability, fitness and environmental stress.

549,"The small molecule drug CBL0137 increases the level of DNA damage and the efficacy of radiotherapy for glioblastoma Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable brain tumor with inevitable recurrence. This is in part due to a highly malignant cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulation of tumor cells that is particularly resistant to conventional treatments, including radiotherapy. Here we show that CBL0137, a small molecule anti-cancer agent, sensitizes GBM CSCs to radiotherapy. CBL0137 sequesters the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex to chromatin, resulting in cytotoxicity preferentially within tumor cells. We show that when combined with radiotherapy, CBL0137 inhibited GBM CSC growth and resulted in more DNA damage in the CSCs compared to irradiation or drug alone. Using an in vivo subcutaneous model, we showed that the frequency of GBM CSCs was reduced when tumors were pretreated with CBL0137 and then exposed to irradiation. Survival studies with orthotopic GBM models resulted in significantly extended survival for mice treated with combinatorial therapy. As GBM CSCs contribute to the inevitable recurrence in patients, targeting them is imperative. This work establishes a new treatment paradigm for GBM that sensitizes CSCs to irradiation and may ultimately reduce tumor recurrence.Copyright © 2020",Excluded,0.6279698
371,"IL-6 promotes stemness of cancer stem cells and may contribute to radiation resistance of non-small cell lung cancer Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among both men and women. Long-term survival of lung cancer patients remains low despite aggressive therapies including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Ionizing radiation (IR) is the standard therapy for patients diagnosed with localized unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However local tumor control by standard fractionated radiotherapy (RT) remains poor due to tumor resistance to IR. Accumulating evidences have indicated that cancer stem cells (CSCs, also known as cancer initiating cells) exist as a very minor population in NSCLC tumors, which are composed of heterogeneous cell populations. Our laboratory and others found that CSC population increases upon irradiation, which may contribute to radiation resistance. The role of IL-6 in NSCLC progression has been suggested since high IL-6 levels were detected in sera of lung cancer patients, but not detectable in most patients with benign lung diseases. However, the exact mechanism by which IL-6 influences lung cancer progression and its role in CSCs mediated radioresistance remain unresolved. Method(s): We isolated CD133+ CSC population from 3 NSCLC cell lines (NSCLC-CSCs) and studied the role of IL-6 in CD133+ CSCs growth by treating cells with IL-6. In addition, we manipulated IL-6 expression levels in the IL-6 expressing A549 and H157 cells by the knockdown of IL-6 using lentiviral infection system carrying IL-6siRNA and isolated CD133+ cells for further analyses. The growth and stem cell marker expressions of these CSCs, IL-6 treated or non-treated, or IL-6 expressing or knocked down cells upon irradiation were then investigated. The differences in the activation of signaling pathways and neuroendocrine differentiation were also studied. Results and Conclusion(s): We found that IL-6 increased self-renewal of NSCLC-CSCs significantly and thereby increased NSCLC-CSC population. We also found that IL-6 increased stemness of the isolated CD133+ CSCs when CD133+ cells were treated with IL-6. More importantly, when we irradiated the CD133+ CSCs isolated from the IL-6 knocked down and scramble control A549 cells, we found that the CSCs isolated from the IL-6 knocked down cells exhibited lower survival than the CSCs of control cells. Therefore, we suggest that IL-6 may contribute to NSCLC-CSCs mediated-radioresistance via (i) direct triggering radioresistance, and (ii) increasing self-renewal and stemness of the survived CSCs. Mechanistic dissection studies revealed that the increased self-renewal of CSCs by IL-6 is due to the activation of the hedgehog signaling and the increased expression of bcl-2, while the IL-6 mediated increase of radioresistance is due to the activation of neuroendocrine differentiation, Stat 3 signaling pathway, and increased expression of bcl-2.",Excluded,0.62796897

And nowadays, no effective biological markers have been identified for predicting the prognosis of patients with ESCC. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is associated with a poor prognosis of various malignancies. The present study aimed to assess the effect of PDGF-BB on radiotherapeutic responses of ESCC and the underlying mechanisms of its roles in ESCC. Serum from 68 cases that received neoadjuvant or radical radiotherapy was obtained before and during radiotherapy. Gene expression analyses were validated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The prognosis of patients with significantly reduced PDGF-BB was probably better than that of the others found in the progression-free survival and overall survival groups. Depletion of PDGFB significantly suppressed the proliferation, invasion and migration of cancer cells. Inhibiting PDGFB induced cellular apoptosis and promoted the sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR). Furthermore, IR inhibited PDGF-BB-induced migration by blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway in ESCC cells. We found that the expression of PDGF-BB provided a possible model for predicting ESCC radiotherapy. It can also be used as a prognostic indicator for locally advanced ESCC that was treated by radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.62796736
743,"Plasminogen is a master regulator and a potential drug candidate for the healing of radiation wounds Around 95% of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy experience cutaneous side effects, and some develop radiation wounds or fibrosis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for these indications. We show here that plasminogen administration enhanced the healing of radiation wounds via pleiotropic effects on gene expression. Using RNA sequencing, we found that plasminogen downregulated the expression of genes in the TLR, TNF, WNT, MAPK, and TGF-beta signaling pathways, and enhanced the anti-inflammatory effect of arachidonic acid, leading to significantly decreased inflammation and improved remodeling of granulation tissue compared with placebo treatment. In addition, plasminogen induced metabolic changes, including decreased glycolysis. Importantly, many of the factors downregulated by plasminogen are pro-fibrotic. Therefore, in radiation wounds with excessive inflammation, plasminogen is able to enhance and redirect the healing process, such that it more closely resembles physiological healing with significantly reduced risk for developing fibrosis. This makes plasminogen an attractive drug candidate for the treatment of radiation wounds in cancer patients.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.6279672

Despite the known sensitivity of sperm to ionizing radiation, the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility in crustaceans have not been studied. For the first time, the present study aimed to assess the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility, sperm DNA damage and concomitant impacts on breeding in two amphipod crustaceans. Echinogammarus marinus and Gammarus pulex (male fertility only) were exposed to phosphorus-32 at dose rates of 0, 0.1, 1 and 10mGy/d and sperm parameters, DNA damage and knock-on impacts on breeding were assessed. Sperm quality parameters and DNA damage were assessed using a fluorescent staining method and single cell gel electrophoresis respectively. Concomitant effects of male exposure to radiation on fecundity were determined by pairing phosphorus-32 exposed males to unexposed sexually mature females. In E. marinus, a statistically significant reduction of 9 and 11% in the quality of sperm was recorded at dose rates of 1 and 10mGy/d respectively, with no significant effects recorded on sperm counts. Conversely in the freshwater G. pulex, no significant impact of radiation on sperm quantity or quality was recorded. For E. marinus, a statistically significant increase in DNA damage was recorded at doses of 10mGy/d. Reduced fecundity and an increase in the frequency of abnormal embryos was recorded in female E. marinus breeding with males exposed to radiation. These findings suggest sperm quality may be a sensitive indicator of radiation exposure in invertebrates with potential impacts on the unexposed embryo, though unclear dose-response and differences between two closely related species necessitate further study before robust conclusions can be drawn.

364,"High expression of Rad51c predicts poor prognostic outcome and induces cell resistance to cisplatin and radiation in non-small cell lung cancer Rad51c is critical for homologous recombination repair and genomic stability and may play roles in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy. We investigated the expression level and clinical significance of Rad51c in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and determined the effect of Rad51c on NSCLC cell chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity. Rad51c expression was detected using immunohistochemistry and was higher in NSCLC patient samples than in adjacent normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high Rad51c expression was an independent predictor of short overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in NSCLC patients receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Furthermore, Rad51c knockdown increased the killing effect of ionizing radiation (IR) and enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptotic cells in NSCLC cells by disrupting the repair of cisplatin- and IR-induced DNA damage. In addition, ectopic expression of Rad51c dramatically enhanced NSCLC cell resistance to cisplatin and radiotherapy. These findings suggest that increased expression of Rad51c may confer resistance to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy of NSCLC, and also be an independent prognostic factor for patient outcome. Therefore, targeting Rad51c may represent an improved therapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients with locally advanced disease.Copyright © 2016, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).",Excluded,0.62796575
1104,"Differentiation of functionally active mouse T lymphocytes from functionally inactive bone marrow precursors II. Limited recovery of T-cell responses from mouse bone marrow in tissue culture The limited differentiation of mature T cell function from mouse bone marrow in tissue culture is described and compared with similar differentiation occuring in vivo in irradiated bone marrow protected mice. Data are presented to show that a pool of precursors, similar in size to that able to produce early (transient?) regeneration in thymectomized recipients, is responsible for the development of mitogen responsive T cells active in MLC (proliferation) and CML (development of cytotoxic cells) assays. In contrast, a helper cell population which augments antibody formation from T-depleted normal spleen cells derives from a pool of similar precursors yet does not seem to be theta positive. Similarly, larger cells (perhaps typical of those giving rise to suppressor T cells in vivo) give rise to a suppressor cell pool after 4 days of culture, though again only a fraction of this suppressor activity could be attributed to theta positive cells. It is suggested that much of the data for regenration of T lymphocytes in vitro from T-depleted sources needs to be re-interpreted in terms of this evidence for a pool of post-thymic precursors of T cells in such T-deficient cell populations.",Excluded,0.6279656

1060,"Estimation of long-term salivary gland damage induced by radiotherapy A classification is proposed for estimating salivary gland damage induced by radiotherapy to the head and neck. The volume of salivary glands irradiated was evaluated, and their relative proportions of whole saliva output were calculated. Stimulated salivary flow rate was measured in 61 patients treated with radiotherapy for head and neck malignancies. A highly significant negative correlation was found between the classification of salivary gland damage and stimulated salivary flow rate. The volume of the major salivary glands irradiated seems to be the most important factor affecting the postirradiation salivary flow after a curative dose of radiotherapy. If possible, partial sparing of the salivary glands may help to keep the patient's salivary secretion at an acceptable level and promote protection against dental caries. Most patients irradiated to the head and neck, however, need an effective prophylactic programme for the rest of their lives in order to preserve their teeth.",Excluded,0.6279627

The mechanism by which VP-16 exerts its cytotoxic and antineoplastic actions has not yet been firmly established, although the unique correlation between sensitivity to ionizing radiation and to topoisomerase II inhibitors suggest the involvement of DNA double-strand breaks. In the present study we analyzed the chromosomal sensitivity of lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patients to low concentrations of the drug. Our results indicate that AT derived cells are hypersensitive to the clastogenic activity of VP-16 either when the drug is present for the whole duration of the cell cycle or specifically in the G2 phase, confirming that the induction of DNA double strand breaks, to which AT cells seem typically sensitive, could have an important role in the biological activity of VP-16.",Excluded,0.6279623

In the capacity of additional tests, loading tests involving in vitro irradiation at the dose of 1 Gy of a suspension of lymphocytes and incubations for 5 and 24 hours were used. Activation of the initial apoptotic and necrotic death of peripheral blood lymphocytes was revealed in the persons chronically exposed to low-intensity radiation within the range from 0.01 to 4.23 Gy. Exposed patients demonstrated a decrease in the number of CD95(+)-cells as compared to unexposed patients.

It is considered that antigen-specific T cells are involved in the pathogenesis. However, the role of drug-specific T cells in the skin lesions is not fully investigated. We expanded skin-infiltrating T cells from 4-mm biopsied lesional skin samples of TEN, SJS, DIHS, and erythema multiforme (EM) using anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and IL-2. We obtained >107 cells/specimen by this method. For the drug reactivity, T cells labeled with CFSE were cultured with X-ray-irradiated PBMCs from the same patients and causative drugs, and the proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry. The cytokine profiles of responding T cells were also examined by intracellular staining for interferon (IFN)-gamma;, IL-4, and IL-17, or by cytokine quantification of the supernatants. Both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells proliferated to the causative drugs in all cases. Notably, 80% of expanded CD8+ T cells with the causative drugs expressed high levels of IFN-gamma. The expanded CD4+ T cells bore IFN-gamma, IL-4 or IL-17A at various frequencies. The culture supernatants contained IL-17A at various concentrations. The ability of T cells to produce IL-17A did not correlate with their ability to produce the other cytokines. In DIHS, however, the IL-17A production levels appeared to fluctuate in parallel with the clinical courses. Our results demonstrate that drug-specific T cells are definitely present in the skin infiltrate of severe drug eruptions. It is suggested that drug-reactive, IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells infiltrate at a high frequency and Th17 cells also participate in the formation of lesional skin depending on cases.",Excluded,0.6279571

In this context, the aim of this research was to compare these methods in the biomonitoring of health professionals occupationally exposed to ionising radiation. In parallel, the C-banding technique was applied to confirm the presence of unstable chromosomal aberrations (dicentrics and rings). For this, samples of peripheral blood from health professionals of three hospitals (Recife - Brazil) were collected and lymphocyte cultures were carried out based on classical cytogenetic techniques. The number of cells scored per subject was the same (1000) for each assay.

445,"Simulation of inflorescence dynamics in oil palm and estimation of environment-sensitive phenological phases: a model based analysis For oil palm, yield variation is in large part due to variation in the number of harvested bunches. Each successively-produced phytomer carries a female (productive), male or aborted inflorescence. Since phytomer development takes 3-4 years and nearly two phytomers are produced per month, many inflorescences develop in parallel but have different phenological stages. Environment-dependent developmental rate, sex and abortion probability determine bunch productivity, which, in turn, affects other phytomers via source-sink relationships. Water deficit, solar radiation, temperature and day length are considered key external factors driving variation. Their impact is difficult to predict because of system complexity. To address this question we built a simple model (ECOPALM) to simulate the variation in number of harvested bunches. In this model, trophic competition among organs, expressed through a plant-scale index (Ic), drives sex determination and inflorescence abortion during specific sensitive phases at phytomer level. As a supplemental hypothesis, we propose that flowering is affected by photoperiod at phytomer level during a sensitive phase, thus, contributing to seasonal production peaks. The model was used to determine by parameter optimisation the influence of Ic and day length on inflorescence development and the stages at which inflorescences are sensitive to these signals. Parameters were estimated against observation of number of harvested bunches in Ivory Coast using a genetic algorithm. The model was then validated with field observations in Benin and Indonesia. The sensitive phases determined by parameter optimisation agreed with independent experimental evidence, and variation of Ic explained both sex and abortion patterns. Sex determination seemed to coincide with floret meristem individualisation and occurred 29-32 months before bunch harvest. The main abortion stage occurred 10 months before harvest - at the beginning of rapid growth of the inflorescence. Simulation results suggest involvement of photoperiod in the determination of bunch growth dynamics. This study demonstrates that simple modelling approaches can help extracting ecophysiological information from simple field observations on complex systems.",Excluded,0.62795573
626,"Lifelong hematopoiesis in both reconstituted and sublethally irradiated mice is provided by multiple sequentially recruited stem cells Objective. To evaluate the dynamics of stem cell production to hematopoiesis, the number of active stem cell clones and the lifespan of individual clones were studied. Materials and Methods. The clonal contribution of primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) responsible for long-term hematopoiesis was determined using two approaches. In one model, irradiated female mice were reconstituted with retrovirally marked male hematopoietic cells. In the second model, mice were irradiated sublethally without hematopoietic cell transplantation. In both models, bone marrow cells were serially sampled from the same mouse throughout a 12- to 20-month period and injected into irradiated recipients for analysis of day 10 colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S). The donor origin of CFU-S was determined by the presence of retrovirally marked cells or cells with chromosomal aberrations. Results. The results of the two essentially different models show that 1) hematopoiesis is mainly the product of small clones of hematopoietic cells; 2) the lifespan of the majority of clones is only 1 to 2 months; 3) the clones usually function locally; and 4) the vast majority of the clones replace one another sequentially. Primitive HSCs capable of producing long-lived clones (about 10% among all clones), which exist during the entire life of a mouse, were detected by the radiation-marker technique only. Conclusion. Multiple short-living clones (at least on the level of CFU-S production) comprise the vast majority of the active stem cells in transplanted recipients or after endogenous recovery from sublethal irradiation. © 2001 International Society for Experimental Hematology.",Excluded,0.62795365

We have combined mutations in factors from both repair pathways, the HR protein Rad54 and the DNA-end-binding factor Ku80, which has a role in NHEJ. Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) mice were severely compromised in their survival, such that fewer double mutants were born than expected, and only a small proportion of those born reached adulthood. However, double-mutant mice died at lower frequency from tumors than Ku80 single mutant mice, likely as a result of rapid demise at a young age from other causes. When challenged with an exogenous DNA damaging agent, ionizing radiation, double-mutant mice were exquisitely sensitive to low doses. Tissues and cells from double-mutant mice also showed indications of spontaneous DNA damage. Testes from some Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) mice displayed enhanced apoptosis and reduced sperm production, and embryonic fibroblasts from Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) animals accumulated foci of gamma-H2AX, a marker for DSBs.

Recently, the role of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity has been reported in several types of cancers. Here, we investigated whether temozolomide (TMZ) and irradiation (IR) combined treatment induced Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells. And we further performed a preliminary study about the effect of Nrf2 on chemoradiation sensitivity. Immunohistochemical staining for Nrf2 in paired clinical specimens showed that TMZ and IR combined treatment increased the expression and nuclear localization of Nrf2 in human glioblastoma tissues. Moreover, we found nuclear Nrf2 expression in the glioblastoma tissues obtained from the patients undergoing TMZ and IR combined treatment was associated with the time to tumor recurrence. In vitro, we further verified these findings. First, we detected increased nuclear localization of Nrf2 following treatment with TMZ+IR in human glioblastoma cell lines. Second, we demonstrated TMZ+IR increased the levels of Nrf2 protein in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of U251 cells and induced Nrf2 target genes expression. Finally, downregulating Nrf2 expression increased TMZ+IR-induced cell death in the U251 cells. These findings suggest TMZ+IR combined treatment induces Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells.

There are 60, 000 active brick kilns, providing employment to nearly 12 million people in different suboccupations. This industry is largely non-mechanized and operates from November to June. Almost all the workers are exposed to direct sunlight for 8-10 h a day. Cellular DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are the biologically active nucleoprotein complexes formed between DNA and proteins. Ultraviolet light and gamma-rays, and other suspected carcinogens in humans, induce DPC formation in blood cells. DPCs have therefore been identified as a biomarker for monitoring exposure to these hazardous agents. Here we report steady-state levels of DPCs in human peripheral lymphocytes from 46 brick-kiln workers exposed occupationally for 8-10 h a day to solar radiation in brickfields and 25 unexposed controls. A significant increase (p <0.05) in DPC content and DPC coefficients in peripheral lymphocytes was observed in the brick-kiln workers compared with the controls.

904,"Bone marrow-derived cells rescue salivary gland function in mice with head and neck irradiation Treatment for most patients with head and neck cancers includes ionizing radiation. A consequence of this treatment is irreversible damage to salivary glands (SGs), which is accompanied by a loss of fluid-secreting acinar-cells and a considerable decrease of saliva output. While there are currently no adequate conventional treatments for this condition, cell-based therapies are receiving increasing attention to regenerate SGs. In this study, we investigated whether bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) can differentiate into salivary epithelial cells and restore SG function in head and neck irradiated mice. BMDCs from male mice were transplanted into the tail-vein of 18 Gy-irradiated female mice. Salivary output was increased in mice that received BMDCs transplantation at week 8 and 24 post-irradiation. At 24 weeks after irradiation (IR), harvested SGs (submandibular and parotid glands) of BMDC-treated mice had greater weights than those of non-treated mice. Histological analysis shows that SGs of treated mice demonstrated an increased level of tissue regenerative activity such as blood vessel formation and cell proliferation, while apoptotic activity was increased in non-transplanted mice. The expression of stem cell markers (Sca-1 or c-kit) was detected in BMDC-treated SGs. Finally, we detected an increased ratio of acinar-cell area and approximately 9% of Y-chromosome-positive (donor-derived) salivary epithelial cells in BMDC-treated mice. We propose here that cell therapy using BMDCs can rescue the functional damage of irradiated SGs by direct differentiation of donor BMDCs into salivary epithelial cells. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Our objective was to determine whether irradiation and bone marrow transplantation affected inflammation and fibrosis associated with inhaled asbestos exposure. Inflammation, cytokine production, and fibrosis were assessed in lungs of naive and sex-mismatched chimeric mice exposed to asbestos for 3, 9, or 40 days. Potential engraftment of donor-derived cells in recipient lungs was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Compared with asbestos-exposed naive (nonchimeric) mice, chimeric mice exposed to asbestos for 3, 9, or 40 days demonstrated significant abrogation of acute increases in asbestos-associated inflammatory mediators and fibrosis.

However, the effects of radiation therapy on telomere DNA of non-cancer tissue have not been thoroughly investigated. This study analyzed the telomere length of inpatients with cancer treated with radiation therapy to see whether the telomere lengths change in response to therapeutic radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-five patients were enrolled in the study. The patients had lung cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatoma, or rectal cancer. They received radiation therapy with a dose range of 15-74 Gy. The telomere lengths and telomere length distribution in peripheral leukocytes were analyzed by using a Southern blot-based method. Result(s): The telomere length and the telomere length distribution of the peripheral leukocytes did not change after radiation therapy. However, there was a significant proportional decrease in the short telomere fraction (< 4.4 kb) per day and per Gy. Conclusion(s): This observation suggested that the telomere length distribution of peripheral leukocytes could be affected by radiation therapy, and that the effect of radiation tends to appear in cells with short telomeres. Radiation therapy-associated somatic telomere length change within a short range of time, about three months or shorter, can be detected by analyzing the mean telomere length and telomere length distribution. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded,0.6279429
481,"Therapeutic applications of PARP inhibitors: Anticancer therapy and beyond The aim of this article is to describe the current and potential clinical translation of pharmacological inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) for the therapy of various diseases. The first section of the present review summarizes the available preclinical and clinical data with PARP inhibitors in various forms of cancer. In this context, the role of PARP in single-strand DNA break repair is relevant, leading to replication-associated lesions that cannot be repaired if homologous recombination repair (HRR) is defective, and the synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors in HRR-defective cancer. HRR defects are classically associated with BRCA1 and 2 mutations associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer, but there may be many other causes of HRR defects. Thus, PARP inhibitors may be the drugs of choice for BRCA mutant breast and ovarian cancers, and extend beyond these tumors if appropriate biomarkers can be developed to identify HRR defects. Multiple lines of preclinical data demonstrate that PARP inhibition increases cytotoxicity and tumor growth delay in combination with temozolomide, topoisomerase inhibitors and ionizing radiation. Both single agent and combination clinical trials are underway. The final part of the first section of the present review summarizes the current status of the various PARP inhibitors that are in various stages of clinical development. The second section of the present review summarizes the role of PARP in selected non-oncologic indications. In a number of severe, acute diseases (such as stroke, neurotrauma, circulatory shock and acute myocardial infarction) the clinical translatability of PARP inhibition is supported by multiple lines of preclinical data, as well as observational data demonstrating PARP activation in human tissue samples. In these disease indications, PARP overactivation due to oxidative and nitrative stress drives cell necrosis and pro-inflammatory gene expression, which contributes to disease pathology. Accordingly, multiple lines of preclinical data indicate the efficacy of PARP inhibitors to preserve viable tissue and to down-regulate inflammatory responses. As the clinical trials with PARP inhibitors in various forms of cancer progress, it is hoped that a second line of clinical investigations, aimed at testing of PARP inhibitors for various non-oncologic indications, will be initiated, as well. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study aimed to identify mechanisms that confer hypoxia resistance. Partially hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-resistant proximal tubular (PT) cells were selected by exposing PT cultures to repetitive cycles of H/R. Thereafter, H/R-induced changes in mRNA and protein expression, inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DELTAPSI(m)), formation of superoxide, and cell death were compared between H/R-adapted and control PT cultures. As a result, H/R-adapted PT cells exhibited lower H/R-induced hyperpolarization of DELTAPSI(m) and produced less superoxide than the control cultures. Consequently, H/R triggered DELTAPSI(m) break-down and DNA degradation in a lower percentage of H/R-adapted than control PT cells. Moreover, H/R induced upregulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3) in H/R-adapted PT but not in control cultures. In addition, ionizing radiation killed a lower percentage of H/R-adapted as compared to control cells suggestive of an H/R-radiation cross-resistance developed by the selection procedure. Knockdown of UCP-3 decreased H/R- and radioresitance of the H/R-adapted cells.

1106,"Acute Erythemal Ultraviolet Radiation Causes Systemic Immunosuppression in the Absence of Increased 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 Levels in Male Mice Vitamin D is synthesised by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of skin and is hypothesized to be a direct mediator of the immunosuppression that occurs following UV radiation (UVR) exposure. Both UVR and vitamin D drive immune responses towards tolerance by ultimately increasing the suppressive activities of regulatory T cells. To examine a role for UVR-induced vitamin D, vitamin D3-deficient mice were established by dietary vitamin D3 restriction. In comparison to vitamin D3-replete mice, vitamin D3-deficient mice had significantly reduced serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3, <20 nmol.L-1) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3, <20 pmol.L-1). Following either acute erythemal UVR, or chronic sub-erythemal UVR (8 exposures over 4 weeks) treatment, serum 25(OH)D3 levels significantly increased in vitamin D3-deficient female but not male mice. To determine if UVR-induced vitamin D was a mediator of UVR-induced systemic immunosuppression, responses were measured in mice that were able (female) or unable (male) to increase systemic levels of 25(OH)D3 after UVR. Erythemal UVR (>=4 kJ/m2) suppressed contact hypersensitivity responses (T helper type-1 or -17), aspects of allergic airway disease (T helper type-2) and also the in vivo priming capacity of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells to a similar degree in female and male vitamin D3-deficient mice.

728,"Independent roles of calcium and voltage-dependent potassium currents in controlling spike frequency adaptation in lateral amygdala pyramidal neurons The calcium-dependent afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that follows trains of action potentials is responsible for controlling action potential firing patterns in many neuronal cell types. We have previously shown that the slow AHP contributes to spike frequency adaptation in pyramidal neurons in the rat lateral amygdala. In addition, a dendritic voltage-gated potassium current mediated by Kv1.2-containing channels also suppresses action potential firing in these neurons. In this paper we show that this voltage-gated potassium current and the slow AHP act together to control spike frequency adaptation in lateral amygdala pyramidal neurons. The two currents have similar effects on action potential number when firing is evoked either by depolarizing current injections or by synaptic stimulation. However, they differ in their control of firing frequency, with the voltage-gated potassium current but not the slow AHP determining the initial frequency of action potential firing. This dual mechanism of controlling firing patterns is unique to lateral amygdala neurons and is likely to contribute to the very low levels of firing seen in lateral amygdala neurons in vivo.",Excluded,0.6279391

Endovascular radiation (beta or gamma) at the time of angioplasty prevents restenosis in a large proportion of vessels in swine (short term) and humans (short and long term). Little information is available about the effects of this radiation exposure beyond the wall of the coronary arteries., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Samples were obtained from 76 minipigs in the course of several experiments designed to evaluate endovascular brachytherapy: 76 of 114 coronary arteries and 6 of 12 iliac arteries were exposed to endovascular radiation from 32P sources (35 Gy at 0.5 mm from the intima). Two-thirds of the vessels had angioplasty or stenting.

It was characterized by fibrinoid necrosis of the wall, often associated with lymphocytic exudates or thrombosis. Based on the review of perpendicular sections of tissue samples, the arterioles had received between 6 and 40 Gy. This arteriolar vasculitis occurred at 28 days in samples from 51% of irradiated coronary arteries and 100% of irradiated iliac arteries. By 6 months, the incidence of acute vasculitis decreased to 24% around the coronary arteries. However, at that time, healing vasculitis was evident, often with luminal narrowing, in 46% of samples. Vasculitis was not seen in any of 44 samples from unirradiated vessels (0%) and had no relation to angioplasty, stenting, or their sequelae. This radiation-associated vasculitis in the swine resembles the localized lymphocytic vasculitis that we have reported in tissues of humans exposed to external radiation. On the other hand, it is quite different from the various types of systemic vasculitis that occur in nonirradiated humans., CONCLUSION: Endoarterial brachytherapy using 32P results in vascular effects beyond the adventitia of the target vessel. This necrotizing vasculitis is causally related to radiation, but its mechanism is unclear and a dose effect is not evident. Quite possibly, local upregulation of inflammatory cytokines contributes to this radiation-associated vasculitis, which only involved some of the arterioles in each sample. It is likely that radiation-associated vasculitis also occurs around human coronary arteries and may result in foci of ischemia. To our knowledge, this lesion has not been previously recognized, either in experimental models or in human specimens examined after angioplasty/brachytherapy.",Excluded,0.62793815
1033,"The epidemiology of vitamin D and colorectal cancer: recent findings PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight the human studies published over the past year examining the influence of vitamin D on risk of colorectal cancer., RECENT FINDINGS: Studies over the past year have added more support to the idea that higher levels of vitamin D may decrease risk of colorectal cancer. Further, typical dietary intakes such as 200-400 IU/day may be too low to exert appreciable benefits, and protection may occur with higher levels of vitamin D associated with exposure to sunshine. Recent studies also suggest a potential benefit of vitamin D on other digestive-tract cancers, and that vitamin D status at the time of diagnosis and treatment may influence survival of cancer. However, the evidence for these latter findings is based on limited data and needs to be confirmed. Higher vitamin D levels may also be associated with a higher rate of apoptosis in colorectal mucosa., SUMMARY: Recent studies add more support to a potential role of vitamin D on risk of colorectal cancer, but suggest that intakes higher than customary are required if solar ultraviolet-B exposure is low. More studies are required to determine the optimal levels and intakes of this vitamin to reduce cancer risk. Potential benefits of vitamin D on other digestive-tract cancers and on survival in patients with colorectal cancer have been suggested by recent studies, but require confirmation.",Excluded,0.62793493
545,"Evidence that a single stem cell can lead to multi-organ engraftment Purification of rare hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to homogeneity is required to study their self-renewal, differentiation, phenotype, and homing. Long-term repopulation (LTR) of irradiated hosts and serial transplantation to secondary hosts represent the gold standard for demonstrating self-renewal and differentiation, the defining properties of HSC. We show that rare cells that home to bone marrow can LTR primary and secondary recipients. During the homing, CD34 and SCA-1 expression increases uniquely on cells that home to marrow. These adult bone marrow cells have tremendous differentiative capacity as they can also differentiate into epithelial cells of the liver, lung, GI tract, and skin. This finding may contribute to clinical treatment of genetic disease or tissue repair.",Excluded,0.62792844
622,"Cytoplasmic chromatin triggers inflammation in senescence and cancer Chromatin is traditionally viewed as a nuclear entity that regulates gene expression and silencing. However, we recently discovered the presence of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments that pinch off from intact nuclei of primary cells during senescence, a form of terminal cell-cycle arrest associated with pro-inflammatory responses. The functional significance of chromatin in the cytoplasm is unclear. Here we show that cytoplasmic chromatin activates the innate immunity cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase linked to stimulator of interferon genes) pathway, leading both to short-term inflammation to restrain activated oncogenes and to chronic inflammation that associates with tissue destruction and cancer. The cytoplasmic chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway promotes the senescence-associated secretory phenotype in primary human cells and in mice. Mice deficient in STING show impaired immuno-surveillance of oncogenic RAS and reduced tissue inflammation upon ionizing radiation. Furthermore, this pathway is activated in cancer cells, and correlates with pro-inflammatory gene expression in human cancers. Overall, our findings indicate that genomic DNA serves as a reservoir to initiate a pro-inflammatory pathway in the cytoplasm in senescence and cancer. Targeting the cytoplasmic chromatin-mediated pathway may hold promise in treating inflammation-related disorders.Copyright © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

980,"FANCD2 depletion sensitizes cancer cells repopulation ability in vitro Inactivation of Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway in some cancers causes increased sensitivity to various drugs used for chemo-therapy. Several approaches have been suggested to artificially disrupt this pathway for better treatment. In our study, we have utilized RNA interference technique to knock-down the expression of FANCD2 and sensitize cancer cells undergoing treatment with DNA damaging agents. For this purpose, we transiently depleted FANCD2 by siRNA in a number of breast, bladder, or liver cancer cell lines and screened for mitomycin C or gamma-irradiation sensitivity changes. We could show that knocking-down FANCD2 gene expression increases sensitivity of cancer cells to mitomycin C and to less extent to gamma-rays. Importantly, this effect strongly correlates to repopulation ability of cancer cells and those cell lines with significant FANCD2 depletion revealed decreased recurrence capacity. In summary, the results we presented show proof of principle that opens new possibilities for further preclinical trials.",Excluded,0.6279255
63,"Characterization of neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius pars centralis Esophageal sensory afferent inputs terminate principally in the central subnucleus of the tractus solitarius (cNTS). Neurons of the cNTS comprise two major neurochemical subpopulations. One contains neurons that are nitric oxide synthase (NOS) immunoreactive (-IR) while the other comprises neurons that are tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-IR. We have shown recently that TH-IR neurons are involved in esophageal-distention induced gastric relaxation. We used whole cell patch clamp techniques in rat brainstem slices combined with immunohistochemical and morphological reconstructions to characterize cNTS neurons. Postrecording reconstruction of cNTS neurons revealed two morphological neuronal subtypes; one group of cells (41 out of 131 neurons, i.e., 31%) had a multipolar soma, while the other group (87 out of 131 neurons, i.e., 66%) had a bipolar soma. Of the 43 cells in which we conducted a neurochemical examination, 15 displayed TH-IR (9 with bipolar morphology, 6 with multipolar morphology) while the remaining 28 neurons did not display TH-IR (18 with bipolar morphology, 10 with multipolar morphology). Even though the range of electrophysiological properties varied significantly, morphological or neurochemical distinctions did not reveal characteristics peculiar to the subgroups. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) recorded in cNTS neurons had a frequency of 1.5 +/- 0.15 events s(-1) and an amplitude of 27 +/- 1.2 pA (Vh = -50 mV) and were abolished by pretreatment with 30 muM AP-5 and 10 muM CNQX, indicating the involvement of both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors. Some cNTS neurons also received a GABAergic input that was abolished by perfusion with 30-50 muM bicuculline. In conclusion, our data show that despite the heterogeneity of morphological and neurochemical membrane properties, the electrophysiological characteristics of cNTS neurons are not a distinguishing feature.",Excluded,0.6279222
830,"Malignant melanoma and other second cutaneous malignancies in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The influence of additional therapy after total skin electron beam radiation BACKGROUND: Previous large studies have shown that patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are at increased risk for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and anecdotal case reports have suggested an association with malignant melanoma. It has been postulated that the exposure of cutaneous structures to potentially carcinogenic therapies, such as ionizing radiation or alkylating agents, might be causally associated with the development of these second cutaneous malignancies, but, to date, no study has directly addressed this issue. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of second cutaneous malignancies in a group of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated with total skin electron beam therapy and to examine the additional effects of oral psoralen with UV-A phototherapy, topical mechlorethamine hydrochloride therapy, and further radiation therapy. One hundred sixty-four patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma who had received total skin electron beam therapy between 1974 and 1990 were identified, and information was abstracted from their records., RESULTS: Six patients developed malignant melanoma 12 to 95 months after total skin electron beam therapy. Of the six patients, three had received oral psoralen with UV-A as additional therapy and two had received topical mechlorethamine. None had received additional radiation therapy. Twenty-four patients developed more than 37 basal cell carcinomas and 34 squamous cell carcinomas from 11 months to more than 10 years after total skin electron beam therapy. Of the 24 patients, 15 had received oral psoralen with UV-A and 12 had received mechlorethamine as additional therapy. Additional radiation therapy had been administered to nine patients. During a median follow-up of 6 years, no patients died of any second cutaneous malignancy., CONCLUSION: We found a high rate of both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. The additional use of mechlorethamine or oral psoralen plus UV-A, but not radiation, was significantly associated with the development of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but not malignant melanoma.",Excluded,0.62791914
710,"Outbreak of pneumonia associated with emergent human adenovirus serotype 14--Southeast Alaska, 2008 BACKGROUND: In September 2008, an outbreak of pneumonia associated with an emerging human adenovirus (human adenovirus serotype 14 [HAdV-14]) occurred on a rural Southeast Alaska island. Nine patients required hospitalization, and 1 patient died., METHODS: To investigate the outbreak, pneumonia case patients were matched to control participants on the basis of age, sex, and community of residence. Participants in the investigation and their household contacts were interviewed, and serum samples and respiratory tract specimens were collected. Risk factors were evaluated by means of conditional logistic regression., RESULTS: Among 32 pneumonia case patients, 21 (65%) had confirmed or probable HAdV-14 infection. None of 32 matched control participants had evidence of HAdV-14 infection (P<.001 for the difference). Factors independently associated with pneumonia included contact with a known HAdV-14-infected case patient (odds ratio [OR], 18.3 [95% confidence interval {CI}, >or=2.0]), current smoking (OR, 6.7 [95% CI, >or=0.9]), and having neither traveled off the island nor attended a large public gathering (OR, 14.7 [95% CI, >or=2.0]). Fourteen (67%) of 21 HAdV-14-positive case patients belonged to a single network of people who socialized and often smoked together and infrequently traveled off the island. HAdV-14 infection occurred in 43% of case-patient household contacts, compared with 5% of control-participant household contacts (P = .005)., CONCLUSIONS: During a community outbreak in Alaska, HAdV-14 appeared to have spread mostly among close contacts and not widely in the community. Demographic characteristics and illness patterns among the case patients were similar to those observed in other recent outbreaks of HAdV-14 infection in the United States.",Excluded,0.62791425
708,"Hemoglobin levels and acute radiotherapy-induced toxicity AIMS AND BACKGROUND: To analyze the possible correlation between hemoglobin concentration and the appearance of acute radiotherapy-induced toxicity., METHODS: We prospectively studied hemoglobin levels and acute radiotherapy-induced toxicity in 86 patients treated for 3 months. Both sexes were considered to have anemia if their hemoglobin level was < or = 12 g/dL. No patient received corrective treatment for hemoglobin levels. Acute toxicity was analyzed weekly during radiotherapy and 45 days after therapy ended. The possible relationship between anemia and toxicity was analyzed, as was the correlation between hemoglobin values and the degree of toxicity., RESULTS: The findings were similar for all prognostic factors in patients with and without anemia. Hemoglobin concentration was < or = 12 g/dL in 24 patients (27.9%; mean, 10.93 +/- 0.78 g/dL). At the end of radiotherapy, hemoglobin levels were < or = 12 g/dL in 18 patients (20.9%; mean, 11.26 +/- 1.06 g/dL). The correlation between pretherapy and posttherapy hemoglobin concentration was significant at r = 0.729 (P = 0.01). The correlation between absolute hemoglobin values and the degree of toxicity, and the possible relationship between hemoglobin concentration and the appearance or the degree of toxicity after radiotherapy, was not significant., CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation of the tumor and healthy tissues was not linear. This may account for the influence of hemoglobin levels on control of the disease as reported in earlier studies, but it does not account for their influence on acute toxicity after radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.6279028

565,"Factors influencing the degree of erythematous skin reactions in humans Dose-response relationships have been studied using an ordinal visual scale and reflectance spectrophotometry data from 123 treatment sites on 110 patients treated with 10 dose fractions over 12-14 days. Dose rates varied between 3 and 240 Gy/h and total doses of between 25 and 41 Gy were given using teletherapy apparatus. We found qualitative scoring of erythematous skin reactions to be subject to considerable inter- and intra-observer variation. Reflectance spectrophotometry provided more reproducible information, some of which was undetectable by naked eye. Baseline erythema readings were significantly higher in male patients and at anatomical sites of previous heavy UV exposure. In addition, a pronounced decline in erythema readings during the second week of therapy and 'reciprocal vicinity' (abscopal) effects adjacent to the field, undetected by the eye, were observed in a subset of patients. Meaningful dose-response relationships could be derived only from reflectance data with peak change from the pretreatment baseline measure providing the best discrimination. Peak erythema measures following treatment were found to depend on the age and gender of the patient as well as the treatment site and its baseline erythema measurement. This was independent of the total dose administered or the instantaneous dose rate at which it was delivered. The rate of erythema development was also dose rate dependent but only weakly dependent on the biological dose intensity (Gy equiv./day) of the treatment course. The data raise the question of whether irradiation-induced erythema is exclusively a secondary phenomenon occurring as a result of basal cell killing. The short repair half time value of 0.06 h obtained by direct analysis is perplexing and may reflect a dose rate-dependent physiological vasodilatory response to irradiation and/or a multi-component cellular repair process.",Excluded,0.627873
577,"Detection of point mutations at codon 12 of KI-ras in ophthalmic pterygia AIMS: Ophthalmic pterygium is a potentially vision-threatening lesion of unknown etiology, related to an exposure to solar light. Mutations to the ras genes are frequently observed in lesions related to an exposure to solar light. The present study aims at screening pterygia for mutations at codons 12 and 13 of the ras genes., METHODS: In all, 50 pterygia were examined, together with respective blood samples and specimens of normal conjunctiva. A PCR reaction was performed to amplify sequences containing codons 12 and 13 of Ki-ras, H-ras, and N-ras. An RFLP analysis was then performed to detect point mutations at codon 12. The mutational status at codons 12 and 13 was further explored with sequencing of PCR products., RESULTS: RFLP analysis revealed Ki-ras mutations at codon 12 in five (10%) of pterygia, whereas H-ras or N-ras mutations were not observed. Sequencing confirmed Ki-ras mutations at codon 12 and revealed absence of mutations at codon 13. The presence of Ki-ras mutations was significantly correlated with postoperative recurrence (P=0.02) and young age (P=0.04). Mutations were not observed in specimens of blood or normal conjunctiva for any of the genes examined., CONCLUSIONS: The absence of N-ras mutations is in agreement with previous reports concerning mucosal lesions. The detection of Ki-ras mutations and the association with postoperative recurrence implies a possible role of Ki-ras in the clinical profile of pterygium. The mechanism of Ki-ras mutations is unclear and could be independent of the action of UV light.",Excluded,0.62786615

The goal of this study was to assess long-term survival of patients with OPC alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis. Method(s): This study included newly diagnosed patients with OPC, who had been treated with radiation and were alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis. Overall survival (OS) probabilities beyond 5 years were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Factors associated with OS were determined using Bayesian piecewise exponential survival regression. Standardized mortality ratios for all-cause death were estimated controlling for study year, age, and sex in the US general population. Result(s): Among 1699 patients, the additional 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year OS probabilities were 94%, 83%, and 63%, respectively, and were lower than those in the general population. Patients who were older, were current or former smokers, had other than tonsil or base of tongue tumors, or had T4 tumors had a higher risk of death. Patients who had base of tongue tumors and had received intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or lower-radiation doses had a lower risk of death. Standardized mortality ratios were higher among current and heavy smokers and lower among recipients of IMRT and lower radiation doses. Conclusion(s): In this large cohort, long-term survival among patients with OPC was good but lower than predicted for the general population. Patients treated with IMRT and those with less tobacco exposure had better outcomes.Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society",Excluded,0.62786305

It can be induced by many triggers, such as ionizing radiation. Methods We report a case of radiotherapy-induced pemphigus (RIP) with a review of the published cases in the English and French literature. Results A 61-year old man was diagnosed to have epidermoid carcinoma of the piriform sinus and then received a 70 Gy radiation therapy. One month after the treatment completion, multiple blisters and erosions occurred initially on the site of irradiation, then in other skin areas. Histological examination showed an intraepidermal blister with acantholysis and necrosis of individual keratinocytes. Direct immunofluorescence and indirect immunofluorescence were typical of pemphigus. Immunoblot revealed antibodies reacting with a 110 kDa antigen. This feature was consistent with the diagnosis of RIP. Less than 20 cases of RIP have been reported previously. Mean age at diagnosis was 64.2 years, and there is a slight female preponderance. RIP occurred, in most cases, initially within the area of irradiation. Conclusion Our patient showed some distinctive findings never reported previously in RIP: a histological focal keratinocyte necrosis, and the presence of autoantibodies reacting with a 110 kDa keratinocytic protein in immunoblot analysis. Because of a different prognosis, it is important to differentiate RIP and paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP), although cases of ionizing radiation-induced PNP had also been described. As in our patient, RIP seems to respond well to systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy, which induce remission within a few months. © 2011 The International Society of Dermatology.",Excluded,0.6278069

The aim of the study was to analyze the response of antioxidant systems through the determination of the antioxidant markers in the blood of patients exposed to oxidative stress resulting from the routine HRCT examination of the chest. Blood of 35 people aged 60.77 +/- 10.81 taken before and at four time points after the examination constituted the test material. The determination of the total antioxidant capacity expressed as ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and ferric reducing antioxidant activity and ascorbic acid concentration (FRASC) were performed together with an examination of catalase activity and the concentration of the reduced glutathione. The organism's response to ionizing radiation was associated with a significant decrease in the antioxidant markers' levels at all time-points and showed a significant negative correlation depending on the radiation dose. Visible down-regulation of these markers is a response to increased oxidative stress. In light of the obtained results, the measurement of the selected markers of antioxidant defense may be a useful parameter of oxidative stress caused by ionizing radiation.",Excluded,0.62777126
299,"Corticofugal modulation of the tactile response coherence of projecting neurons in the gracilis nucleus Precise and reproducible spike timing is one of the alternatives of the sensory stimulus encoding. We test coherence (repeatability) of the response patterns elicited in projecting gracile neurons by tactile stimulation and its modulation provoked by electrical stimulation of the corticofugal feedback from the somatosensory (SI) cortex. To gain the temporal structure we adopt the wavelet-based approach for quantification of the functional stimulus-neural response coupling. We show that the spontaneous firing patterns (when they exist) are essentially random. Tactile stimulation of the neuron receptive field strongly increases the spectral power in the stimulus and 5- to 15-Hz frequency bands. However, the functional coupling (coherence) between the sensory stimulus and the neural response exhibits ultraslow oscillation (0.07 Hz). During this oscillation the stimulus coherence can temporarily fall below the statistically significant level, i.e., the functional stimulus-response coupling may be temporarily lost for a single neuron. We further demonstrate that electrical stimulation of the SI cortex increases the stimulus coherence for about 60% of cells. We find no significant correlation between the increment of the firing rate and the stimulus coherence, but we show that there is a positive correlation with the amplitude of the peristimulus time histogram. The latter argues that the observed facilitation of the neural response by the corticofugal pathway, at least in part, may be mediated through an appropriate ordering of the stimulus-evoked firing pattern, and the coherence enhancement is more relevant in gracilis nucleus than an increase of the number of spikes elicited by the tactile stimulus.",Excluded,0.62774724
33,"Peritumoral inflammatory reaction in non-melanoma skin cancers - histological and immunohistochemical study Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) are the most frequent types of cancer in white skin populations, all over the world. In the last 40 years, there was observed a rapid increase of their incidence, because of the UV radiations exposure and weather changes. Although its morbidity is a relatively modest one, the direct social costs of NMSCs are quite substantial due to a high incidence. Due to these reasons, numerous studies try to clarify the etiopathogenic mechanisms of NMSCs, to elaborate treatment and prevention measures. In the last years, a special attention was given to the relation between inflammation and skin cancer. In our study, we performed a histological and immunohistological evaluation of the inflammatory reaction on a number of 73 surgical exeresis pieces coming from the patients diagnosed with NMSCs. Of these, 21 were squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 52 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). The peritumoral inflammatory reaction in NMSCs was an extremely variable one in intensity and distribution, from one case to another and even from one area to another within the same tumor, thus proving the complexity of the relations between tumor cells and the cells of the immune system. By comparing the intensity of the inflammatory reaction between the two main types of NMSCs, there was observed that in SCCs the inflammatory reaction was more intense in comparison to BCCs. Also, in SCC there was highlighted a more abundant inflammatory infiltrate in poorly differentiated carcinomas, in comparison to the well-differentiated ones. The presence of the immune system cells (T-lymphocytes, macrophages, mast cells) among the tumoral cells, in a direct contact with these, makes us believe that between the two categories of cells there may appear mechanisms of intercellular communication, distinct from the mechanisms of paracrine signaling.",Excluded,0.6276926

In all patients, dose-volumetric parameters were analyzed according to their relation to development of HT, and thyroid volumes spared from doses >=10, 20, 30, 40 and 50Gy (V10, V20, V30, V40 and V50) were analyzed from the dose volume histograms (DVHs)., RESULTS: Median follow-up duration was 31months. At the end of study, 33 patients (42.3%) developed HT and the cumulative incidence of HT was 24.6%, 36.5% and 42.3% at one, two and three years, respectively. V30 of 42.1% (P=0.005) was defined as dose-volumetric threshold of radiation-induced HT in HNSCC patients. Our analysis showed that V30 separates patients into low- and high-risk groups; the incidence of radiation-induced HT in the group with V30<42.1% and V30>=42.1% was 29.4% and 71.4%, respectively (P=0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: The V30 may predict risk of developing HT after RT for HNSCC patients.

142,"Set-up of an infrared fast behavioral assay using zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae, and its application in compound biotoxicity screening Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is increasingly employed for evaluating toxicity and drug discovery assays. Commonly experimental approaches for biotoxicity assessment are based on visual inspection or video recording. However, these techniques are limited for large-scale assays, as they demand either a time-consuming detailed inspection of the animals or intensive computing resources in order to analyze a considerable amount of screenshots. Recently, we have developed a simple methodology for tracking the locomotor activity of small animals cultured in microtiter plates. In this work, we implemented this automatic methodology, based on infrared (IR) microbeam scattering, for measuring behavioral activity in zebrafish larvae. We determined the appropriate culture conditions, number of animals and stage of development to get robust results. Furthermore, we validated this methodology as a rapid test for evaluating toxicity. By measuring the effects of reference compounds on larvae activity, we were able to estimate the concentration that could cause a 50% decrease in activity events values (AEC50), showing a strong linear correlation (R2 = 0.91) with the LC50 values obtained with the standard DarT test. The toxicity order of the measured compounds was CuSO4 > 2,4-dinitrophenol > 3,4-dichloroaniline > SDS > sodium benzoate > EDTA > K2CrO4 ; regarding solvents, EtOH = DMSO. In this study, we demonstrate that global swimming behavior could be a simple readout for toxicity, easy to scale-up in automated experiments. This approach is potentially applicable for fast ecotoxicity assays and whole-organism high-throughput compound screening, reducing the time and money required to evaluate unknown samples and to identify leading pharmaceutical compounds.

In the use of megavoltage sources and a continuous irradiation course the 5-year survival was 8.8%. The use of a split course in rational dosimetric planning made it possible to improve the 3-year survival up to 22.4% in a split course and up to 11.2% in a continuous course. The use of the optimum dosimetric planning made it possible while irradiationg esophageal cancer patients to reduce radiation exposure of the pulmonary tissue and to achieve a decrease of severe forms of radiation pneumonia.",Excluded,0.627538
479,"Trend dynamics of thyroid cancer incidence among China and the U.S. adult population from 1990 to 2017: a joinpoint and age-period-cohort analysis BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common malignant disease of the endocrine system. Based on the previously published reports, the incidence of TC has been increasing in the past 25 years, and the reason for the increase is not yet clear. The present study aims to reveal the long-term trends and age-period-cohort effects for the incidence of TC in China and the U.S. from 1990 to 2017., METHODS: We examined the trends of TC incidence and the average annual percentage change (AAPC) of rate using the Joinpoint regression analysis in the two countries, for the different genders (men/women) in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD 2017). We further used an age-period-cohort model to analyze age-period-cohort effects on TC incidence., RESULTS: The ASIR of China increased markedly with AAPC of 4.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.0, 5.0%) and 1.8% (1.6, 2.0%) for men and women during 1990-2017. The ASIR of the U. S increased by 1.4% (1.0, 1.8%) and 1.3% (0.9, 1.7%) for men and women from 1990 to 2017.TC increased with the age and period. Aging was one of the most influential factors of TC in China. The age effect increased markedly in the U.S. compared with China. The period effect showed an increase in China while that tended to grow steadily during 1990-2017 in the U.S. The cohort effect peaked in 1963-1967 birth cohorts for men and women in China and declined consistently in the birth cohort in the U.S., CONCLUSION: From 1990 to 2017, due to ionizing radiation and over-diagnosis, age-standardized TC incidence rates in both genders rose in China and the U.S. The standardized incidence rate of women is higher than that of men. It is necessary to provide women with reasonable prevention and protection measures for TC. We need to apply for health services and screening to reduce ionizing radiation.",Excluded,0.62749106
440,"Simplified screening for immune complexes by laser nephelometry of ultracentrifuged serum Serum samples were drawn from 14 healthy volunteers after an overnight fast and again after a meal. Each sample was divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 20 min, and a portion from the middle of the tube was removed by puncturing the tube's side. All samples were then added to cuvettes containing 0.14 M NaCl alone or 1, 2, 3, or 4% polyethylene glycol in 0.15 M KCl. The light scattering of each tube was measured. The centrifuged samples scattered 58% less light than the uncentrifuged controls. The range of values obtained with the centrifuged samples was also smaller as reflected in the standard deviation of the means obtained at each polyethylene glycol concentration. The coefficient of variation for replicate samples ranged from 0 to 16.6% (mean 5.8%), even when samples were processed differently. Storage at -70 degrees C significantly increased light scattering compared to baseline values. Serum samples were drawn from 44 patients with diseases that have been associated with immune complexes. Nephelometry selectively identified some groups of patients as abnormal. We conclude that preparative ultracentrifugation removes much of the background light scattering of serum samples, including that due to lipid, under conditions that do not sediment out immune complexes. Because it measures a physical property of immune complexes, this assay may provide information that is not available from biological receptor-based assays.",Excluded,0.6274572
594,"Parotid gland function after radiotherapy: The combined Michigan and Utrecht experience Purpose: To analyze the combined and updated results from the University of Michigan and University Medical Center Utrecht on normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) of the parotid gland 1 year after radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck (HN) cancer. Patients and Methods: A total of 222 prospectively analyzed patients with various HN malignancies were treated with conventional and intensity-modulated RT. Stimulated individual parotid gland flow rates were measured before RT and 1 year after RT using Lashley cups at both centers. A flow ratio <25% of pretreatment was defined as a complication. The data were fitted to the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model. Result(s): A total of 384 parotid glands (Michigan: 157; Utrecht: 227 glands) was available for analysis 1 year after RT. Combined NTCP analysis based on mean dose resulted in a TD50 (uniform dose leading to 50% complication probability) of 39.9 Gy and m (steepness of the curve) of 0.40. The resulting NTCP curve had good qualitative agreement with the combined clinical data. Mean doses of 25-30 Gy were associated with 17-26% NTCP. Conclusion(s): A definite NTCP curve for parotid gland function 1 year after RT is presented, based on mean dose. No threshold dose was observed, and TD50 was equal to 40 Gy.

141,"Monochromatic excimer light (308 nm): an immunohistochemical study of cutaneous T cells and apoptosis-related molecules in psoriasis BACKGROUND: Various types of UVB radiation source (290-320 nm) are used in treating psoriasis and their therapeutic mechanism has been attributed to immunosuppressive properties. Recently, a new UVB source generated by a 308-nm excimer laser has been introduced for the treatment of psoriasis., OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the immunohistochemical evaluation of T cells and the expression of various apoptosis-related molecules in the psoriatic hyperproliferative skin before and after treatment with 308-nm monochromatic excimer light (MEL)., METHODS: Ten patients (three women and seven men), ranging in age from 29 to 79 years, affected by plaque-type psoriasis vulgaris, were treated with MEL. Biopsies from psoriatic lesions of MEL-treated sites were taken before, 24 h and/or 48 h after the first irradiation and analysed by the immunophosphatase alkaline technique (APAAP)., RESULTS: MEL treatment was found to cause a significant decrease in the rate of proliferation of keratinocytes and a relevant depletion of T cells in all psoriatic lesions, 48 h after the first irradiation: 308 nm light eliminated T cells from the psoriatic epidermis and also from the dermis, highlighting the ability of this UVB source to penetrate the skin compared with normal UVB and establish direct cytotoxic action on T cells infiltrating skin lesions. Rapid clearing of psoriatic lesions involves potential molecular targets of UVB in T cells including p53, which is upregulated after direct irradiation with 308-nm UVB. Moreover, Bcl-2 expression in healing psoriasis epidermis after MEL treatment is significantly decreased compared with untreated skin and the TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling) technique revealed the presence of relevant apoptotic keratinocytes in the irradiated epidermis., CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that psoriatic skin after monochromatic excimer light therapy is associated with significant T-cell depletion and alterations of apoptosis-related molecules accompanied by a decreased proliferation index and clinical remission.",Excluded,0.62730306

817,"The effects of post-radiation education pamphlet on self-efficacy in cancer patients Cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy often experience anxiety and a sense of loss of control immediately after completion of their active treatment. This study aims to evaluate, using a cross-sectional survey, the effects of a post-radiation education pamphlet on the self-efficacy of cancer patients in terms of seeking/understanding medical information, seeking support, and coping with radiation side effects. Forty-eight patients from various age groups with a variety of cancer diagnoses were recruited from the Radiation Medicine Program at Princess Margaret Hospital. Descriptive analysis of 35 survey responses suggests that the pamphlet improved patient self-efficacy in terms of seeking and understanding medical information, seeking support, and coping with radiation side effects. The benefits of the pamphlet were also found to be independent of patients' education level. Despite the small sample size, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the education pamphlet in improving patient self-efficacy and gives support to the pamphlet's utility in improving the transition care of cancer patients finishing radiotherapy. In parallel, 40 Princess Margaret Hospital Radiation Medicine Program staff members were also asked, via online surveys, about their awareness of the pamphlet, and its usefulness in terms of content, format, and timing of the information provided. More than 90% of the staff indicated that the pamphlet was an effective tool. Only 57% of oncologists were aware of the pamphlet's existence. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

321,"A double-blind randomised controlled trial of a natural oil-based emulsion (Moogoo Udder Cream R) containing allantoin versus aqueous cream for managing radiation-induced skin reactions in patients with cancer BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced skin reaction (RISR) is one of the most common and distressing side effects of radiotherapy in patients with cancer. It is featured with swelling, redness, itching, pain, breaks in skin, discomfort, and a burning sensation. There is a lack of convincing evidence supporting any single practice in the prevention or management of RISR., METHODS/DESIGNS: This double-blinded randomised controlled trial aims to investigate the effects of a natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin (as known as Moogoo Udder Cream R) versus aqueous cream in reducing RISR, improving pain, itching and quality of life in this patient group. One group will receive Moogoo Udder Cream R. Another group will receive aqueous cream. Outcome measures will be collected using patient self-administered questionnaire, interviewer administered questionnaire and clinician assessment at commencement of radiotherapy, weekly during radiotherapy, and four weeks after the completion of radiotherapy., DISCUSSION: Despite advances of radiologic advances and supportive care, RISR are still not well managed. There is a lack of efficacious interventions in managing RISR. While anecdotal evidence suggests that Moogoo Udder Cream R may be effective in managing RISR, research is needed to substantiate this claim. This paper presents the design of a double blind randomised controlled trial that will evaluate the effects of Moogoo Udder Cream R versus aqueous cream for managing in RISR in patients with cancer., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN 12612000568819.",Excluded,0.625564
433,"Effects of non-covalent self-association on the subcutaneous absorption of a therapeutic peptide PURPOSE: To utilize an acylated peptide as a model system to investigate the relationships among solution peptide conformation, non-covalent self-association, subcutaneous absorption and bioavailability under pharmaceutically relevant solution formulation conditions., METHODS: CD spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, equilibrium sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and size exclusion chromatography were employed to characterize the effects of octanoylation on conformation and self-association of the 31 amino acid peptide derivative des-amino-histidine(7) arginine(26) human glucagon-like peptide (7-37)-OH (IP(7)R(26)GLP-1). Hyperglycemic clamp studies were performed to compare the bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of solution formulations of oct-IP(7)R(26)GLP-1 administered subcutaneously to normal dogs., RESULTS: Octanoylation of IP(7)R(26)GLP-1 was shown to confer the propensity for a major solvent-induced conformational transition with an accompanying solvent- and temperature-dependent self-association behavior. Formulations were characterized that give rise to remarkably different pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics that correlate with distinct peptide conformational and self-association states. These states correspond to: (i) a minimally associated alpha-helical form (apparent molecular weight = 14 kDa), (ii) a highly associated, predominantly beta-sheet form (effective molecular diameter 20 nm), and (iii) an unusually large, micelle-like soluble beta-sheet aggregate (effective molecular diameter 50 nm)., CONCLUSIONS: Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of a self-associating peptide can be influenced by aggregate size and the ease of disruption of the non-covalent intermolecular interactions at the subcutaneous site. Hydrophobic aggregation mediated by seemingly innocuous solution formulation conditions can have a dramatic effect on the subcutaneous bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of a therapeutic peptide and in the extreme, can totally preclude its absorption. A size exclusion chromatographic method is identified that distinguishes subcutaneously bioavailable aggregated oct-IP(7)R(26)GLP-1 from non-bioavailable aggregated oct-IP(7)R(26)GLP-1.",Excluded,0.6237267
467,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for adult T-cell leukemia/Lymphoma-Romanian experience Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a rare and aggressive mature T-cell malignancy caused by the human T lymphoma virus I (HTLV-I) affecting 3-5% of HTLV-1 carriers and is usually diagnosed in endemic regions. Romania is a region with high prevalence of HTLV-1 infection and ATLL and with low median age at diagnosis for aggressive types. We performed a retrospective analysis of post-transplant outcome in the first Romanian patients with ATLL receiving hematopoietic stem cell allotransplant. The study population included eight patients (three males, five females), with median age of 39.5 (range 26-57), with acute (one case) and lymphoma type (seven cases) that received peripheral stem cells (PBSC) from matched related (MRD) and unrelated donors (MUD) after reduced intensity conditioning. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) developed in six patients. Relapse occurred in four cases (50%) at a median time of 5-months post-transplant. Six patients died: four cases with disease-related deaths and two patients with GVHD-related deaths. The median survival post-transplant was 19.5 months (range 2.3-44.2 months). The post-transplant survival at 1-year was 62.5%, at 2-years 50%, and at 3-years 37.5%. In our opinion allogeneic transplant improves outcome in aggressive type ATLL.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

960,"Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms and Parkinson's disease in a population with high ultraviolet radiation exposure INTRODUCTION: A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency has been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD). Epidemiologic studies examining variability in genes involved in vitamin D metabolism have not taken into account level of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). We examined whether exposure to UVR (as a surrogate for vitamin D levels) and variations in the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) are associated with PD., METHODS: Within a geographical information system (GIS) we linked participants' geocoded residential address data to ground level UV data to estimate historical exposure to UVR. Six SNPs in VDR were genotyped in non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects., RESULTS: Average lifetime UVR exposure levels were >5000 Wh/m(2), which was higher than levels for populations in previous studies, and UVR exposure did not differ between cases and controls. Homozygotes for the rs731236 TT (major allele) genotype had a 31% lower risk of PD risk (OR=0.69; 95% CI=0.49, 0.98; p=0.04 for TT vs. TC+CC). The rs7975232 GG (minor allele) genotype was also associated with decreased risk of PD (OR=0.63; 95% CI=0.42, 0.93; p=0.02 for GG vs. TG+TT). The association between PD risk and a third locus, rs1544410 (BsmI), was not statistically significant after adjustment for covariates, although there was a trend for lower risk with the GG genotype., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial evidence that VDR polymorphisms may modulate risk of PD in a population highly exposed to UVR throughout lifetime.

322,"Effects of irradiation on nasal mucociliary clearance in head and neck cancer patients A prospective longitudinal study was conducted on fifty patients of histopathologically confirmed head and neck cancer with the main aim to assess the nasal mucociliary clearance, pre- and post-irradiation; and to compare the findings with the healthy non-irradiated age and sex-matched controls. All the patients underwent saccharin particle test for nasal mucociliary clearance before commencement of radiation therapy and again within 6 months of completion of radiation therapy. The difference between the saccharin perception times of nasal mucosa in the healthy non-irradiated controls and the pre-irradiated head and neck cancer patients were statistically insignificant (P> 0.05). But, the difference between the saccharin perception times of nasal mucosa in the pre- and post-irradiated head and neck cancer patients was found to be statistically significant (P=0). It is concluded that even indirect irradiation of nasal mucosa in head and neck cancer patients significantly affect its ciliary activity.

Gastrointestinal bleeding is a frequent cause of hospital admission and is a factor in hospital morbidity and mortality. Understanding the cause and specific differences between the onset, signs and symptoms and evolution of upper and lower GI bleeding is essential for proper treatment. Our purpose was to compare prevalence, the onset, clinical outcomes and resource utilization between subjects with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Materials and methods. We did a retrospective study, during the period from January 1st 2018 to 15 March 2019, on batch of 418 patients admitted in Gastroenterology and Hepatology Clinic of Timisoara with gastrointestinal bleeding. Using clinical observations, assessing the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level, hemoglobin concentration, platelet, white blood cell counts, proteins level, electrolytes, creatinine, urea and with the help of the endoscopy Results. Our study group includes 418 patients admitted in clinic with gastrointestinal bleeding. There is a higher prevalence of a upper gastrointestinal bleeding 80,14%(335) compared to lower gastrointestinal bleedings prevalence 19,86% (83). Etiology, for upper gastrointestinal bleeding includes: peptic ulcer 47,9%, esophageal and gastric varices 22,80%, Mallory- Weiss syndrome 4,65%, gastric cancer 2,32%, vascular ectasia 2,79%, Dieulafoy lesion 2,79%, esophageal ulcer 0,46%, jejunal bleeding 0,46%. For lower gastrointestinal bleeding etiology includes: diverticulum or diverticulosis 30,86%, hemorrhoids 18,51%, colonic polyps 14,81%, colonic cancer 7,41%, inflammatory bowel disease 4,93%,ischemic colitis 1,23%,irradiation colitis 3,70%. A 7,34% percentage of the GI bleeding didn't have an obvious cause.The mean age for UGIB was 58(+/-20) years and for LGIB 68(+/-5) years.Subjects with UGIB compared to LGIB had greater admission hemodynamic instability including tachycardia, lower blood pressure or shock. Severe anemia was present at 30% of patients with LGIB and at 52,13% of patients with UGIB. Creatinine, urea ratio was grown in UGIB. Generally a low level of protein is more common in LGIB group. For the other biological parameters evaluated there is no significant difference between UGIB group and LGIB group. Hematochezia and bloody diarrhea are most common in LGIB but they also appeared in 1,26% of UGIB. Melena appeared in 3, 57 % of LGIB (small bowel or cecal bleeding). Mortality was 11,94% in UGIB group and 6,02% in LGIC group. Resource utilization was similar in UGIB and LGIB including mean costs, length of stay and number of endoscopic procedures. Conclusions. This presentation could be useful for a rapid diagnostic and therapeutic orientation and and appreciation of the prognosis of bleeding.

413,"Patterns of long-term swallowing dysfunction after definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiation Objectives To identify patterns of long-term, radiation-induced swallowing dysfunction after definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy (RT or CHRT) and to determine which factors may explain these patterns over time. Material and methods The study population consisted of 238 consecutive head and neck cancer patients treated with RT or CHRT. The primary endpoint was >=grade 2 swallowing dysfunction at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after treatment. Cluster analysis was used to identify different patterns over time. The differences between the mean dose to the swallowing organs at risk for each pattern were determined by using dose maps. Results The cluster analysis revealed five patterns of swallowing dysfunction: low persistent, intermediate persistent, severe persistent, transient and progressive. Patients with high dose to the upper pharyngeal, laryngeal and lower pharyngeal region had the highest risk of severe persistent swallowing dysfunction. Transient problems mainly occurred after high dose to the laryngeal and lower pharyngeal regions, combined with moderate dose to the upper pharyngeal region. The progressive pattern was mainly seen after moderate dose to the upper pharyngeal region. Conclusions Various patterns of swallowing dysfunction after definitive RT or CHRT can be identified over time. This could reflect different underlying biological processes.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
