426,"Transgenerational effects of preconception paternal contamination with (55)Fe The conjecture that germline mutations induced by radiation exposure before conception may predispose subsequent offspring to cancer remains contentious. Previous experimental studies have shown that preconception paternal irradiation with (239)Pu induces perturbations in the hemopoietic systems of offspring and influences sensitivity to a secondary carcinogen. In the present study, male DBA2 mice were injected intravenously with the Auger electron emitter (55)Fe (4 kBq g(-1)) 18 or 84 days before mating with normal females. Comet analysis showed an increased incidence of DNA strand breaks in sperm from contaminated animals after 84 days, but not after 18 days, indicating spermatogonial rather than spermatid damage. Offspring were either assayed for changes in bone marrow stem cells and committed progenitors or challenged with the chemical carcinogen methyl nitrosourea (MNU, 50 mg/kg) at 10 weeks of age and monitored for the onset of malignancy. Offspring from irradiated fathers had normal peripheral blood profiles, although the stem cell population was amplified in offspring arising from those exposed to (55)Fe at 84 days before conception. Exposure to MNU significantly increased the incidence of lympho-hemopoietic malignancies in offspring from the 84-day group, but not in those from the 18-day group. These findings support the hypothesis that aberrations that are potentially leukemogenic may be transmitted to offspring after radiation damage to the paternal germline.",Excluded,0.71283376
1116,"A critical period for estrogen action on neurons of the song control system in the zebra finch The song nuclei of the male zebra finch (Poephila guttata) contain larger neurons than those of the female. This gender difference arises after hatching as a result of cell atrophy in the female and cell growth in the male. Implantation of estrogen in female chicks induces masculine differentiation of neurons in their song nuclei. The effects of estrogen on neuron size decline steeply after posthatching day 35 when neuronal atrophy begins. Estrogen loses its masculinizing effects completely after day 45 when the adult level of neuronal atrophy is reached. Thus, the end and the intensity of hormone action appear to be correlated with the timing of neuronal atrophy.",Excluded,0.7128301

The induction of chromosome aberrations in irradiated males Irradiated males were mated to females that had received treatment with caffeine or honey (by feeding), and the frequencies of sex chromosome losses and chromosome rearrangements induced in mature spermatozoa of the males were compared. Caffeine treatment led to an enhancement of the frequencies of sex chromosome loss and a decrease in those of rearrangements. These findings can be interpreted on the assumption that caffeine inhibits repair and misrepair processes that are active in the oocytes. Caffeine treatment administered to one of the female stocks used in these studies was without any effect, presumably because of the absence of a caffeine sensitive repair mechanism in the oocytes.",Excluded,0.71282727
401,"A transgene-based, embryo-specific lethality system for insect pest management Biological approaches to insect pest management offer alternatives to pesticidal control. In area-wide control programs that cover entire regions, the sterile insect technique (SIT) can be used to successfully suppress economically important pest species by the mass release of sterilized pest organisms. However, conventional sterilization by ionizing radiation reduces insect fitness, which can result in reduced competitiveness of the sterilized insects. Here we report a transgene-based, dominant embryonic lethality system that allows for generation of large quantities of competitive but sterile insects without the need of irradiation. The system involves the ectopic expression of a hyperactive pro-apoptotic gene that causes embryo-specific lethality when driven by the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) under the regulation of a cellularization gene enhancer-promoter. We have successfully tested this system in Drosophila melanogaster. The embryonic lethality can be suppressed maternally, which will allow it to be combined with transgenic female-specific lethality systems to raise only vigorous but sterile males.",Excluded,0.71282727
697,"Toxoplasma gondii: effect of sublethal irradiation on host resistance in mice The effect of sublethal whole-body irradiation (500 rad) on the resistance of C57BL/6 mice to infection with Toxoplasma gondii was studied. Mice irradiated 1 day before or 4 days after infection via the intraperitoneal or peroral route with cysts of the mildly virulent ME49 strain of T. gondii died sooner than did unirradiated controls. The time to death of irradiated mice was suggestive of impaired acquired immunity. Irradiated mice infected intraperitoneally with T. gondii cysts exhibited reduced levels of Thy-1+CD4-CD8- cells, less natural killer cell activity against YAC-1 targets, and lower levels of IFN-gamma than controls. Numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells were also lower in infected, irradiated mice. Irradiated mice immunized with a vaccine strain of T. gondii, and later challenged with a highly virulent strain, were less well protected than unirradiated controls. Irradiation appears to impair early, CD4(+)- and CD(8+)-independent resistance to T. gondii, as well as acquisition of immunity.",Excluded,0.71282613
817,"Endocrine function and reproductive impairment in an irradiated population of the lizard Uta stansburiana This study describes gonadal changes in lizards (Uta stansburiana) exposed to chronic low levels of gamma radiation (1.5-10 R/day) under field conditions and attempts to evaluate endocrine involvement in these changes. Reproductive impairment in irradiated males is demonstrated during the breeding season by reduced testes weights and by seminiferous tubules devoid of germ cells. Ultrastructural morphology of Leydig cells, plasma testosterone levels, and developed accessory sex structures indicate normal steroidogenesis in such males; cytology of the pituitary gonadotropes and pituitary gonadotropin content indicate normal gonadotropin levels. These findings suggest that low levels of radiation affect the spermatogenic process directly, rather than through damage to the pituitary. Comparable irradiation causes complete resorption of ovarian tissue in some female Uta. The oviducts are atrophic and the pituitary gonadotropes hyperactive. Resemblance of gonadotropes to those of castrated animals and reduced pituitary hormone content suggest elevated levels of gonadotropin production, probably due to the absence of ovarian steroid feedback in affected animals. The continued mitotic activity of oogonia in adult reptiles and their limited number contribute to the vulnerability of germinal tissue in irradiated female lizards. Destruction of the germ cells is accompanied by resorption of all ovarian tissue including steroidogenic elements. Thus, in females as in males, radiation appears to damage gametogenesis rather than pituitary function.",Excluded,0.7128233
634,"The influence of calf thymus DNA and deoxyribonucleosides on the induction of different mutation types in drosophila The influence of exogenous DNA on the induction of mutations by X-rays was compared with the influence of an equimolar mixture of four deoxyribonucleosides. Pretreatment and posttreatment with calf thymus DNA did not influence the frequency of mutations at the specific loci dp, b, cn and bw as well as Minute mutations induced in Drosophila sperm by X-radiation. Pretreatment with the equimolar mixture of four deoxyribonucleosides increased the frequency of the Minutes, but it did not affect the frequency of mutations at the loci dp, b, cn, bw. Equimolar mixture of nucleosides alone induced a low frequency of Minute mutations in Drosophila sperm. DNA alone induced a low frequency of recessive lethals. These lethals arose as mosaics of small sectors of the gonads of F1 females and they were revealed as late as the F3 generation.",Excluded,0.712823
101,"Hormonal treatment after cytotoxic therapy stimulates recovery of spermatogenesis Previous studies have shown that treatment of rats with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues or steroids either before exposure to procarbazine or radiation or after irradiation enhances subsequent levels of spermatogenesis. We demonstrate here that giving a GnRH agonist after procarbazine injection also enhances spermatogenesis and fertility. We also demonstrate that GnRH agonist stimulated recovery of spermatogenesis and fertility not only when the hormone was administered immediately after irradiation, but also at 20 weeks after irradiation, after the decline in spermatogenesis had occurred. These results suggest that GnRH agonist treatment given to azoospermic men after cytotoxic therapy for cancer may stimulate the recovery of spermatogenesis and fertility.",Excluded,0.712821
804,"Gene expression signatures of radiation exposure in peripheral white blood cells of smokers and non-smokers Purpose: The issue of potential confounding factors is critical to the development of any approach to radiation biodosimetry, and has not been fully addressed for gene expression-based approaches. Material(s) and Method(s): As a step in this direction, we have investigated the effect of smoking on the global radiation gene expression response in ex vivo-irradiated peripheral blood cells using microarray analysis. We also evaluated the ability of gene expression signatures to predict the radiation exposure level of ex vivo-exposed samples from smokers and non-smokers of both genders. Result(s): We identified eight genes with a radiation response that was significantly affected by smoking status, and confirmed an effect of smoking on the radiation response of the four and a half LIM domains 2 (FHL2) gene using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The performance of our previously defined 74-gene signature in predicting the radiation dose to samples in this study was unaffected by differences in gender or smoking status, however, giving 98% correct prediction of dose category. This is the same accuracy as that found in the original study from which the signature was derived, using different donors. Conclusion(s): The results support the development of peripheral blood gene expression as a viable strategy for radiation biodosimetry. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded,0.7128185
600,"Genomic characterization of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in radiation-exposed Chornobyl cleanup workers Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was the predominant leukemia in a recent study of Chornobyl cleanup workers from Ukraine exposed to radiation (UR-CLL). Radiation risks of CLL significantly increased with increasing bone marrow radiation doses. Current analysis aimed to clarify whether the increased risks were due to radiation or to genetic mutations in the Ukrainian population. Method(s): A detailed characterization of the genomic landscape was performed in a unique sample of 16 UR-CLL patients and age- and sex-matched unexposed general population Ukrainian-CLL (UN-CLL) and Western-CLL (W-CLL) patients (n = 28 and 100, respectively). Result(s): Mutations in telomere-maintenance pathway genes POT1 and ATM were more frequent in UR-CLL compared to UN-CLL and W-CLL (both p < 0.05). No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at del13q14, del11q, del17p or trisomy12 was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. Type of work performed in the Chornobyl zone, age at exposure and at diagnosis, calendar time, and Rai stage were significant predictors of total genetic lesions (all p < 0.05). Tumor telomere length was significantly longer in UR-CLL than in UN-CLL (p = 0.009) and was associated with the POT1 mutation and survival. Conclusion(s): No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at CLL-associated genes was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. The novel associations between radiation exposure, telomere maintenance and CLL prognosis identified in this unique case series provide suggestive, though limited data and merit further investigation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded,0.7128126
329,"Altered senescence, apoptosis, and DNA damage response in a mutant p53 model of accelerated aging The tumor suppressors p16(INK4a) and p53 have been implicated as contributors to age-associated stem cell decline. Key functions of p53 are the induction of cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Here, we examine senescence, apoptosis, and DNA damage responses in a mouse accelerated aging model that exhibits increased p53 activity, the p53(+/m) mouse. Aged tissues of p53(+/m) mice display higher percentages of senescent cells (as determined by senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining and p16(INK4a) and p21 accumulation) compared to aged tissues from p53(+/+) mice. Surprisingly, despite having enhanced p53 activity, p53(+/m) lymphoid tissues exhibit reduced apoptotic activity in response to ionizing radiation compared to p53(+/+) tissues. Ionizing radiation treatment of p53(+/m) tissues also induces higher and prolonged levels of senescence markers p16(INK4a) and p21, suggesting that in p53(+/m) tissues the p53 stress response is enhanced and is shifted away from apoptosis toward senescence. One potential mechanism for accelerated aging in the p53(+/m) mouse is a failure to remove damaged or dysfunctional cells (including stem and progenitor cells) through apoptosis. The increased accumulation of dysfunctional and senescent cells may contribute to reduced tissue regeneration, tissue atrophy, and some of the accelerated aging phenotypes in p53(+/m) mice.",Excluded,0.71281004
489,"Characterization of biological peculiarities of the radioprotective activity of double-stranded RNA isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae The purpose of the article: Protection from ionizing radiation is the most important component in the curing malignant neoplasms, servicing atomic reactors, and resolving the situations associated with uncontrolled radioactive pollutions. In this regard, discovering new effective radioprotectors as well as novel principles of protecting living organisms from high-dose radiation is the most important factor, determining the new approaches in medical and technical usage of radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Experimental animals were irradiated on the gamma-emitter (Cs137) with a dose of 9.4 Gy. Radioprotective properties of several agents (total RNA, single-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA and B-190) were estimated by the survival/death rates of experimental animals within 30-90 d. Pathomorphological examination of internal organs end electron microscope assay was done on days 9-12 after irradiation. Cloning and other molecular procedures were performed accordingly to commonly accepted protocols. For assessment of the internalization of labeled nucleic acid, bone marrow cells were incubated with double-stranded RNA labeled with 6-FAM fluorescent dye. Cells with internalized double-stranded RNA were assayed using Axio Imager M1 microscope. In the other experiment, bone marrow cells after incubation with double-stranded RNA were stained with Cy5-labeled anti-CD34 antibodies and assayed using Axioskop 2 microscope. Result(s): In this study, several biological features of the radioprotective action of double-stranded RNA are characterized. It was shown that 160 microg of the double-stranded RNA per mouse protect experimental animals from the absolutely lethal dose of gamma-radiation of 9.4 Gy. In different experiments, 80-100% of irradiated animals survive and live until their natural death. Radioprotective properties of double-stranded RNA were found to be independent on its sequence, but strictly dependent on its double-stranded form. Moreover, double-stranded RNA must have 'open' ends of the molecule to exert its radioprotective activity. Conclusion(s): Experiments indicate that radioprotective effect of double-stranded RNA is tightly bound to its internalization into hematopoietic stem cells, which further repopulate the spleen parenchyma of irradiated mice. Actively proliferating progenitors form the splenic colonies, which further serve as the basis for restoration of hematopoiesis and immune function and determine the survival of animals received the lethal dose of radiation.© Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded,0.71280795
795,"Targeted disruption of NBS1 reveals its roles in mouse development and DNA repair Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease that shares some common defects with ataxia-telangiectasia. The gene product mutated in NBS, named NBS1, is a component of the Mre11 complex that is involved in DNA strand-break repair. To elucidate the physiological roles of NBS1, we disrupted the N-terminal exons of the NBS1 gene in mice. NBS1(m/m) mice are viable, growth retarded and hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (IR). NBS1(m/m) mice exhibit multiple lymphoid developmental defects, and rapidly develop thymic lymphoma. In addition, female NBS1(m/m) mice are sterile due to oogenesis failure. NBS1(m/m) cells are impaired in cellular responses to IR and defective in cellular proliferation. Most systematic and cellular defects identified in NBS1(m/m) mice recapitulate those in NBS patients, and are essentially identical to those observed in Atm(-/-) mice. In contrast to Atm(-/-) mice, spermatogenesis is normal in NBS1(m/m) mice, indicating that distinct roles of ATM have differential requirement for NBS1 activity. Thus, NBS1 and ATM have overlapping and distinct functions in animal development and DNA repair.",Excluded,0.7128059

534,"Hertwig effect caused by UV-irradiation of sperm of Oryzias latipes (teleost) and its photoreactivation When sperm of the fish Oryzias latipes were irradiated with ultraviolet light and allowed to fertilize normal eggs, the so-called ""Hertwig effect"" was observed, with a dose-dependent decrease in survival rate at low doses (0-27 J . m-2) but a better survival rate at higher dose ranges. Illumination with visible light after fertilization (10-70 min after insemination) showed the existence of photoreactivation (PR), demonstrating that pyrimidine dimers are a lesion in sperm DNA that is mainly responsible for the UV-caused Hertwig effect. Genetic analysis, in which sperm from a wild-type of this fish was used, showed that, after UV-irradiation at the high dose range, male nuclei did not participate in embryonic development (a gynogenetic haploid condition). Embryos having only a maternal set of chromosomes could develop no further than stage 27.

1070,"Parasympathetic stimulation improves epithelial organ regeneration Parasympathetic nerves are a vital component of the progenitor cell niche during development, maintaining a pool of progenitors for organogenesis. Injured adult organs do not regenerate after parasympathectomy, and there are few treatments to improve organ regeneration, particularly after damage by therapeutic irradiation. Here we show that restoring parasympathetic function with the neurotrophic factor neurturin increases epithelial organ regeneration after damage. We use mouse salivary gland explant culture containing fluorescently labelled progenitors, and injure the tissue with irradiation. The progenitors survive, parasympathetic function is diminished and epithelial apoptosis reduces the expression of neurturin, which increases neuronal apoptosis. Treatment with neurturin reduces neuronal apoptosis, restores parasympathetic function and increases epithelial regeneration. Furthermore, adult human salivary glands damaged by irradiation also have reduced parasympathetic innervation. We propose that neurturin will protect the parasympathetic nerves from damage and improve organ regeneration. This concept may be applicable for other organs where parasympathetic innervation influences their function.",Excluded,0.71280044
1079,"The role of endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphisms in patients with lung cancer Objectives: Lung cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in the lung tissues. The most common causes of lung cancer include smoking, exposure to radon gas, asbestos, environmental pollutants as well as genetic factors. Nitric oxide (NO) has potential mutagenic and carcinogenic activity and may play an important role in lung cancer. Endothelial NO, synthesized from L-arginine by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), inhibits apoptosis and promotes angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. The aim of the present study was to examine the possible relationship between eNOS gene intron 4 variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) and exon 7-G894T (Glu298Asp) polymorphisms and lung cancer risk. Method(s): DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of 107 lung cancer patients and 100 control subjects. Designated polymorphisms were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Result(s): Our study showed that the frequencies of the b/b genotype and b allele of eNOS gene intron 4 VNTR polymorphism were significantly higher in lung cancer patients than in controls (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant association between eNOS gene G894T polymorphism and lung cancer risk (P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): These results suggest that the presence of the intron 4 VNTR* b allele and b/b genotype may be a genetic risk factor for development of lung cancer. Further larger-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Excluded,0.7127978

F344 rats were exposed to 239PuO22 to achieve an initial lung burden of 0.5 kBq and then exposed 6 h/day, 5 days/week to cigarette smoke at 100 or 250 mg particulate matter/m3 for up to 30 months. Exposure to cigarette smoke increased the cumulative radiation dose to lung by slowing the clearance of 239PuO2. 239PuO2 alone did not affect survival, but the higher cigarette smoke exposure shortened survival in females. Combined exposure to 239PuO2 and cigarette smoke acted synergistically to shorten survival in both genders. The combined effects of cigarette smoke and 239PuO2 were approximately additive for lung hyperplasia and adenomas but were strongly synergistic for carcinomas. Differences between observed incidences and incidences predicted by survival-adjusted models accounting for increased radiation dose revealed a substantial component of synergy for carcinomas above that attributable to the radiation dose effect. The synergy for malignant lung tumors is consistent with findings from uranium miners and nuclear weapons production workers.

706,"The roles of Bcl-xL in modulating apoptosis during development of Xenopus laevis BACKGROUND: Apoptosis is a common and essential aspect of development. It is particularly prevalent in the central nervous system and during remodelling processes such as formation of the digits and in amphibian metamorphosis. Apoptosis, which is dependent upon a balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, also enables the embryo to rid itself of cells damaged by gamma irradiation. In this study, the roles of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-xL in protecting cells from apoptosis were examined in Xenopus laevis embryos using transgenesis to overexpress the XR11 gene, which encodes Bcl-xL. The effects on developmental, thyroid hormone-induced and gamma-radiation-induced apoptosis in embryos were examined in these transgenic animals., RESULTS: Apoptosis was abrogated in XR11 transgenic embryos. However, the transgene did not prevent the apoptotic response of tadpoles to thyroid hormone during metamorphosis. Post-metamorphic XR11 frogs were reared to sexual maturity, thus allowing us to produce second-generation embryos and enabling us to distinguish between the maternal and zygotic contributions of Bcl-xL to the gamma-radiation apoptotic response. Wild-type embryos irradiated before the mid-blastula transition (MBT) underwent normal cell division until reaching the MBT, after which they underwent massive, catastrophic apoptosis. Over-expression of Bcl-xL derived from XR11 females, but not males, provided partial protection from apoptosis. Maternal expression of XR11 was also sufficient to abrogate apoptosis triggered by post-MBT gamma-radiation. Tolerance to post-MBT gamma-radiation from zygotically-derived XR11 was acquired gradually after the MBT in spite of abundant XR11 protein synthesis., CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Bcl-xL is an effective counterbalance to proapoptotic factors during embryonic development but has no apparent effect on the thyroid hormone-induced apoptosis that occurs during metamorphosis. Furthermore, post-MBT apoptosis triggered by irradiation before the MBT could only be restrained by maternal expression of Bcl-xL. Although maternal expression of XR11 was sufficient to abrogate apoptosis triggered by post-MBT gamma-radiation, radiation tolerance from zygotically-derived XR11 was acquired gradually, indicating that synthesis of XR11 protein is not sufficient to prevent apoptosis. Thus, repression of radiation-induced apoptosis by overexpression of Bcl-xL during embryonic development depends upon the timing of its expression and post-translational events that enable the protein to become effective.",Excluded,0.7127933

After 45 or 70 Gy, the CFU-C decreased to 14 +/- 10% in irradiated areas. This remaining CFU-C population probably reflects a combination of radioresistance and survival in situ, and migration of CFU-C from protected marrow areas. The frequency of peripheral blood CFU-C did not change after irradiation. Endogenous colony stimulating activity (CSA), i.e., release of CSA within the marrow cell population, in post-irradiation bone marrow persisted on roughly the same level, indicating a fairly low radiosensitivity of the CSA-producing cells in the bone marrow. Colony stimulating activity in peripheral blood cells and serum remained unchanged, but there were great interindividual variations, and some of the patients with hypercellularity and CFU-C increase in nonirradiated marrow areas also had increased CSA.

168,"Reactive oxygen species and DNA damage after ultrasound exposure The aim of this work was to detect the formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals after ultrasound (US) exposure and test the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species induced by ultrasound can contribute to DNA damage. Formation of reactive oxygen species was observed in incubated medium after sonication with 1 MHz continuous ultrasound at the intensities of 0.61-2.44 W/cm2. Free radicals and hydrogen peroxide produced by ultrasound exposure of cells can lead to DNA damage. Comet assay was used to assess the effect of ultrasound on the level of nuclear DNA damage. The nucleated erythrocytes from fish were exposed in vitro to ultrasound at the same intensities and frequency. It was noticed that ultrasound in all used intensities induced DNA damage. The effect was not eliminated by the addition of catalase, which indicates that DNA damage was not caused by hydrogen peroxide only. The results showed that the DNA damage can be repair and this mechanism was the most effective after 30 and 60 min after sonication. Furthermore, the ultrasound-induced DNA damage in the presence of sonosensitizer (Zn- and AlCl-phthalocyanine) was studied.

763,"Improvement and induction property of radiation-responsive promoter through DNA shuffling of 5'-flanking regions of the human p21 gene A promoter that augments gene expression in response to stimulation of ionizing radiation would be a desired tool for radiogenetic therapy, a combination of radiotherapy and gene therapy. Although various promoters occurring naturally or artificially have been used for researches, one showing higher reactivity to ionizing radiation is desirable. In the present study, we attempted to improve a radiation-responsive promoter of the p21 through a technique called DNA shuffling. A library of DNA fragments was constructed by re-ligation of randomly digested promoter fragments and improved promoters were chosen out of the library. We repeated this process twice to obtain a promoter showing 2.6-fold better reactivity to ionizing radiation compared with its parent, p21 promoter after 10 Gy gamma-ray irradiation. Nucleotide sequence analyses revealed that the obtained promoter was densely packed with some of the cis-acting elements including binding sites for p53, NF-kappaB, NRF-2, AP-1 and NF-Y more than p21 promoter. In addition, it was shown that its induction by ionizing radiation was dependent upon p53 status of a cell line, suggesting that the promoter retained properties of the p21 promoter.

Each recipient was intravenously infused with 1-3 X 10(7) of the mixed marrow cells of donors. In the result, the average incidence of surviving over 1 month was 86% in the recipients. Myelocytic leukemia developed in all the transplanted groups, the average incidence being 88.5%. Leukemia was observed in 1.5-2.5 months after transplantation in the recipients receiving marrow cells from donors exposed to 3 Gy, but in 5-8 months in other groups. It was demonstrated by the analysis of Y-chromosome that the leukemic cells were derived from the donor's marrow cells. The results suggest that marrow transplantation for the mice irradiated by Co-60 gamma-rays of lethal dose can protect them from death, but promote the development of leukemia. Radiation can induce production of factors which lead to leukemic transformation of engrafted normal marrow cells in the irradiated mice; the direct damage of DNA caused by radiation is not the unique factor that gives rise to leukemia.",Excluded,0.71279013
746,"53BP1 Repair Kinetics for Prediction of In Vivo Radiation Susceptibility in 15 Mouse Strains We present a novel mathematical formalism to predict the kinetics of DNA damage repair after exposure to both low- and high-LET radiation (X rays; 350 MeV/n 40Ar; 600 MeV/n 56Fe). Our method is based on monitoring DNA damage repair protein 53BP1 that forms radiation-induced foci (RIF) at locations of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in the nucleus and comparing its expression in primary skin fibroblasts isolated from 15 mice strains. We previously reported strong evidence for clustering of nearby DSB into single repair units as opposed to the classic ""contact-first"" model where DSB are considered immobile. Here we apply this clustering model to evaluate the number of remaining RIF over time. We also show that the newly introduced kinetic metrics can be used as surrogate biomarkers for in vivo radiation toxicity, with potential applications in radiotherapy and human space exploration. In particular, we observed an association between the characteristic time constant of RIF repair measured in vitro and survival levels of immune cells collected from irradiated mice. Moreover, the speed of DNA damage repair correlated not only with radiation-induced cellular survival in vivo, but also with spontaneous cancer incidence data collected from the Mouse Tumor Biology database, suggesting a relationship between the efficiency of DSB repair after irradiation and cancer risk.Copyright ©2020 by Radiation Research Society.

149,"Compartments and cell flows within the mouse haemopoietic system. II. Estimated rates of interchange Part-body irradiated CBA mice were injected with CBA-T6 bone marrow. In this way a predominantly donor population was established in the femora while the marrow of the humeri remained largely (average 94%) of host origin. In animals examined cytologically up to 2 years later, no tendency was observed for the proportion of donor cells in the humeri to increase. Splenectomy had no effect on this. When femoral bone marrow from the experimental mice was injected into lethally (whole-body) irradiated recipients, cells originating from the primary host repopulated the lymph nodes to a disproportionate extent. Equilibration between the cell populations of femora and humeri occurred after re-exposure to 600 rad whole-body irradiation, but not after 100 rad or 350 rad; thus, regeneration of damaged bone marrow involved a significant contribution from extrinsic stem cells only after the highest dose of radiation. The data are compatible with an inflow of at most ten effective stem cells per humerus per day from the blood, and suggest a much lower figure. This means that few if any of the stem cells of peripheral blood enter the bone marrow and found haemopoietic clones. Evidence is adduced for the existence of a proliferating lymphoid sub-population in the bone marrow, contributing some 5-10% of the observed mitoses. The mitotic cells in the lymph nodes are replaced from marrow-derived progenitors at an estimated rate of 4-5%/day. The relevant data for the thymus are more variable, but suggest an average figure of 8-11%/day. Earlier data from mouse parabionts suggest a lower rate of inflow to the thymus.",Excluded,0.712788
737,"Effect of chromosome size on aberration levels caused by gamma radiation as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful technique for detecting genomic alterations at the chromosome level. To study the effect of chromosome size on aberration formation, we used FISH to detect initial damage in individual prematurely condensed chromosomes (PCC) of gamma-irradiated G0 human cells. A linear dose response for breaks and a nonlinear dose response for exchanges was obtained using a chromosome 1-specific probe. FISH detected more chromosome 1 breaks than expected from DNA based extrapolation of Giemsa stained PCC preparations. The discrepancy in the number of breaks detected by the two techniques raised questions as to whether Giemsa staining and FISH differ in their sensitivities for detecting breaks, or is chromosome 1 uniquely sensitive to gamma-radiation. To address the question of technique sensitivity, we determined total chromosome damage by FISH using a total genomic painting probe; the results obtained from Giemsa-staining and FISH were nearly identical. To determine if chromosome 1 was uniquely sensitive, we selected four different sized chromosomes for paint probes and scored them for gamma-ray induced aberrations. In these studies the number of chromosome breaks per unit DNA increased linearly with an increase in the DNA content of the chromosomes. However, the number of exchanges per unit of DNA did not increase with an increase in chromosome size. This suggests that chromosome size may influence the levels of aberrations observed. Extrapolation from measurements of a single chromosome's damage to the whole genome requires that the relative DNA content of the measured chromosome be considered.",Excluded,0.71278304
268,"Effects of psychotherapy on DNA strand break accumulation originating from traumatic stress Background: Previous research reveals an association between traumatic stress and an increased risk for numerous diseases, including cancer. At the molecular level, stress may increase carcinogenesis via increased DNA damage and impaired DNA repair mechanisms. We assessed DNA breakage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and measured the cellular capacity to repair single-strand breaks after exposure to ionizing X-radiation. We also investigated the effect of psychotherapy on both DNA breakage and DNA repair. Method(s): In a first study we investigated DNA breakage and repair in 34 individuals with PTSD and 31 controls. Controls were subdivided into 11 trauma-exposed subjects and 20 individuals without trauma exposure. In a second study, we analysed the effect of psychotherapy (Narrative Exposure Therapy) on DNA breakage and repair. Thirty-eight individuals with PTSD were randomly assigned to either a treatment or a waitlist control condition. Follow-up was performed 4 months and 1 year after therapy. Result(s): In study 1 we found higher levels of basal DNA breakage in individuals with PTSD and trauma-exposed subjects than in controls, indicating that traumatic stress is associated with DNA breakage. However, single-strand break repair was unimpaired in individuals with PTSD. In study 2, we found that psychotherapy reversed not only PTSD symptoms, but also DNA strand break accumulation. Conclusion(s): Our results show-for the first time in vivo-an association between traumatic stress and DNA breakage; they also demonstrate changes at the molecular level, i.e., the integrity of DNA, after psychotherapeutic interventions. © 2014 S.

996,Protective effect of flavonoids from Astragalus complanatus on radiation induced damages in mice This study aimed to evaluate the radioprotective effect of flavonoids extracted from the seeds of Astragalus complanatus R.Br. (FAC) and their protective mechanism against radiation damage. FAC increased the survival rate of mice and made the damaged organ injured by 60Co gamma-irradiation recovered to normal appearance with the mechanism of enhancing immune function and blood-producing function in vivo. The molecule mechanism of FAC against radiation is involved in the reduction of DNA injury and mutation in vitro. Eleven monomers of the FAC were analyzed by HPLC. These results seem to support the use of FAC in relieving radiation damage. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,Excluded,0.71278256
99,"The early causal influence of cell size upon synaptic number: the mutant gigas of Drosophila The number of synaptic contacts formed by a neuron is known to vary with its surface area. This could be because large neurons are able to establish more synaptic sites, or because those neurons that are able to establish more sites are subsequently able to enlarge. To test between these two possibilities clones of enlarged ommatidia were generated in the retina of the Drosophila mutant gigas, by mitotic recombination following gamma-irradiation in the third-instar larva. The numbers of afferent synaptic contacts formed by the photoreceptor terminals in the first optic neuropil, or lamina, were then counted in the adult. The terminals of mutant photoreceptors were also enlarged, but by varying degrees. The sizes of their profiles in single sections merged with the size distribution of terminals having a wild-type phenotype, lying outside the clone in the same lamina. A perimeter of 6.0 microns for the profiles of receptor terminal in cross section was established as a criterion for distinguishing between normal and mutant phenotypes. The mutant terminals had more presynaptic sites. Because only the gigas terminals are mutant and because they enlarged at a time long before synapse formation occurred in the lamina we may conclude that cell enlargement preceded elevated synaptic number. The increase in synaptic number roughly matched the increased membrane surface of the terminals, so as nearly to preserve a constant areal density of synaptic sites over a 5-fold range in synaptic frequency.",Excluded,0.71278113

The study was performed on 149 people, 84 agricultural workers and 65 healthy men from the same area, who served as the control group. The exposed group was divided into a subgroup with 65 individuals moderately exposed (39 men and 26 women) and a highly exposed subgroup consisted of 19 men. The statistical analysis of the comet assay results showed that there were no significant differences in basal DNA damage between pesticide-exposed workers and the control group nor between moderately and highly exposed ones. In addition, exposure of peripheral blood lymphocytes to hydrogen peroxide or gamma-irradiation led to a similar degree of DNA damage and subsequent repair for all the studied populations.

937,"Indirect measurement of mitochondrial proton leak and its application In mitochondria, ATP synthesis is coupled to oxygen consumption by the proton electrochemical gradient established across the mitochondrial inner membrane in a process termed oxidative phosphorylation. It has long been known from stoichiometric studies that ATP synthesis is not perfectly coupled to oxygen consumption. The major inefficiency in the system is leakage of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane driven by the proton electrochemical gradient. The kinetics of the proton leak can be determined indirectly, by measuring the oxygen consumption of mitochondria under non-phosphorylating conditions (plus oligomycin) as a function of the proton electrochemical gradient. This experimental system provides a convenient means to investigate inner membrane permeability to protons and the effect of factors that may effect that permeability. In this paper we review some results from our laboratory of indirect measurement of mitochondrial proton leak and how it has been applied to investigate the effect of aging, obesity and thyroid status on proton leak. The results show that (i) proton leak in isolated liver mitochondria is not significantly different in a comparison of young and old rats, in contrast (ii) there is an apparent increase in proton leak in in situ mitochondria in hepatocytes from old rats when compared to those from young rats, (iii) proton leak in neuronal mitochondria in situ in synaptosomes is not significantly different in young and old rats, (iv) proton leak is greater in isolated liver mitochondria from ob/ob mice compared to lean controls, (v) acute leptin (OB protein) administration restores the increased leak rate in isolated liver mitochondria from ob/ob mice to that of lean controls, (vi) administration of thyroid hormone (T3) increases proton leak in rat muscle mitochondria, and (vii) proton leak in muscle mitochondria is insensitive to the presence of GDP. It is proposed that the experimental system described here for measuring proton leak, is an ideal functional assay for determining whether the novel uncoupling proteins increase inner membrane permeability to protons.",Excluded,0.71278083

Adaptation to the mutagenic effects of X-rays in several experimental populations with irradiation histories Selection responses of the laboratory stock Berlin wild (+60, +K) of Drosophila melanogaster to the mutagenic effects of high, accumulated exposures of X-rays were studied in several sub-populations with long irradiation histories. Interest was focussed on adaptive adjustments of mutation rates. In samples from the populations, radiosensitivities of immature oocytes were tested, by using dominant lethals (A), X-chromosome losses (B) and sex-linked recessive lethals (C) as end-points of genetic radiation damage. Populations RO II and RO V are similar to the previously studied population RO I and were exposed to 2100 R/generation, delivered to oocyte stages 6-14, mature sperm, and spermatids. RO II (first tests after 160 generations) is radioresistant relative to +60 (control). The resistance was characterized by dose-reduction factors (DRFs) of 1.72 (with respect to end-points A, B) and 1.53 (C), and these were similar to those previously obtained for RO I. The resistance of RO II was inherited semidominantly as was that of RO I, and the radiosensitivity of the hybrids RO I/RO II was similar to that of RO I and RO II with respect to end-points A and B. RO V did not become resistant within 25 generations of irradiation history (A). Populations RO III (6000 R/generation) and RO IV (7000 R/generation) have histories of irradiations given to oogonia and spermatogonia. Radiosensitivities of immature oocytes of RO III did not differ from those of +K after 55 generations, but after 105 and 135 generations of irradiation history, DRFs of 1.2 (A) and 1.44 (B) were observed. RO IV was characterized in generations 55-135 by DRFs of 1.31 (A) and 1.72 (B). Selection for relative radioresistance of immature oocytes was found (1) to be reproducible (RO II-RO IV), (2) not to require genetic pre-adaptation (RO V), and (3) to be, in part, also achieved by 'indirect' selection (RO III, RO IV). It is concluded that mutation rates in populations are selectively adjusted to evolutionary requirements.",Excluded,0.7127799

332,"Does tributyl phosphate influence the radiation risk of a highly proliferating system--the early mouse embryo in vitro? Two-cell mouse embryos were exposed in vitro to tributyl phosphate, x rays, or a combination of both. In-vitro development of the embryos was followed microscopically (cleavage to four- and eight-cell embryos, formation of morulae and blastocysts, and hatching of blastocysts). Effects on proliferation were estimated by counting the number of cells per embryo early (48 h p.c. = 48 hours post conceptionem) and late (144 h p.c.) in the preimplantation period. Cytogenetic damage was studied using micronucleus formation as the end point. Tributyl phosphate did not reveal toxic effects up to a concentration of about 5 microM after an exposure time of 18 h. At a concentration of about 15 microM, 50% of late preimplantation embryos showed effects on morphological development and on cell proliferation, and at about 40 microM, 90% of the embryos were affected. Tributyl phosphate did not induce micronuclei. Small effects by x irradiation were observed between 0.25 Gy and 0.5 Gy, depending on the end point measured in the late preimplantation stage. Fifty percent of the embryos were affected by a dose slightly higher than 1 Gy, and 90% after about 4 Gy.

1038,"Evaluating the radioprotective effect of Cimetidine, IMOD, and hybrid radioprotectors agents: An in-vitro study Introduction: There are various radioprotective agents with different mechanisms that help to decrease ionizing radiation side effects. The radioprotective effect of Cimetidine and IMOD was assessed individually and compared with the hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs-IMOD and Cimetidine) on human lymphocyte cells. Method(s): Twenty healthy volunteers (ten men and ten women) participated in the present study. About 75 mL peripheral blood lymphocytes from each individual were collected, and they were divided into 36 groups. Briefly, the blood samples were treated with different concentrations of Cimetidine (12.6 and 25.2 mug/mL) and IMOD (0.04, 0.08, and 0.12 mg/mL), and also a combination of these agents, namely hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs). Besides, the irradiated groups were exposed to 2 and 4 Gy of Co-60 gamma irradiation. The amount of cellular damage was assessed using the micronucleus assay. The repeated measurements and paired T-test statistical analysis were used to compare the micronucleus frequencies in different groups. Result(s): The micronucleus frequencies were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in irradiated groups when the non-toxic concentrations of Cimetidine, IMOD, and HRPAs have been used. The reduction in micronucleus frequency was obtained 5-29% for Cimetidine and 40-51% for IMOD in peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated with 2 Gy. This reduction in 4 Gy irradiation was 8-17% for Cimetidine and 27-37% for IMOD. The HRPAs resulted in a higher radioprotective effect, in a way that they cause up to 58% and 43% micronucleus frequency reduction in 2 and 4 Gy, respectively. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, the HRPAs showed the highest level of radioprotective. In addition, IMOD was remarkably higher radioprotective than Cimetidine, which may be related to its greater non-toxic concentrations.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded,0.712773

Hepatic microarray analyses at postnatal day 21 revealed 147 transcripts were significantly (+/-1.8-fold, p < 0.05) altered by maternal OW, including expression of 20 known SREBP-1-regulated transcripts. Expression of SREBP-1 mRNA and lipogenic transcripts was confirmed using real-time PCR. Increased nuclear levels of SREBP-1 and recruitment to the FASN promoter were confirmed via ELISA and ChIP analyses, respectively. Decreased expression of 10 PPARalpha regulated genes including FGF21 was also uncovered. FGF21 serum levels were lower (p< 0.05) in OW dam offspring. Further serum levels of high mol wt adiponectin (p < 0.05) were decreased in OW dam offspring at weaning. While no changes in %fat mass or adipose tissue adiponectin mRNA were observed, hepatic expression of AdipoR1 and R2 were lower in OW dam offspring. Finally, phosphorylation of the adiponectin target AMPK was significantly decreased in livers of OW dam offspring.

In addition I fit to the data on utility workers a multiplicative Poisson regression model in relation to estimated levels of exposure to 50-Hz electromagnetic fields. Overall, there was an increase in risk for senile dementia and motor neuron diseases combined. The incidences of Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and other diseases of the central nervous system were essentially unrelated to exposure to electromagnetic fields.

The control region (D-loop) of mtDNA is a polymorphic region in which point mutations occur frequently. In this study, point mutation and common deletion (CD) mutations were investigated in 23 samples of NPC tumor tissue and in the radiation-treated NPC cell line CNE2. Polymorphisms at 72 (7.28%, 72/988) nucleotide positions in D-loop region and 6 (0.75%, 6/795) nucleotide positions in part of the functional gene encoding regions were detected in all NPC patients. Of the detected polymorphisms, 8 are novel. These variants are nonencoding transitions, including np292T-->C , np517G-del, np16038A-->G, np513G-del, np16242C-->A, np513G-del, np16242C-->A and np15787T-->C transition. A total of 39 point mutations in the D-loop region of mtDNA were detected in 43.5% (10/23) of the NPC patients. Three point mutations in the functional gene encoding regions of mtDNA were detected in only 8.7% (2/23) of NPC patients. The effect of he mutation at np709G-->A in the 12sRNA gene is unclear, and the A-->G substitution at np15769 in the cytochrome B gene is a synonymous mutation. The C-->T substitution at np15970 in the T Psi C loop of the tRNA(pro) gene could alter the position of the proline residue. After irradiation, the survival fraction of CNE2 cells decreased as X-ray dose increased. Moreover, X-ray radiation could induce apoptosis and the CD mutation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but did not induce mtDNA point mutations. A positive correlation between the apoptosis index and the ratio of CD/WT mtDNA was observed in irradiated CNE2 cells.

967,"Kruppel-like Factor 5 Regulates Stemness, Lineage Specification, and Regeneration of Intestinal Epithelial Stem Cells Background & Aims: Self-renewal and multipotent differentiation are cardinal properties of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), mediated in part by WNT and NOTCH signaling. Although these pathways are well characterized, the molecular mechanisms that control the 'stemness' of ISCs are still not well defined. Here, we investigated the role of Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) in regulating ISC functions. Method(s): We performed studies in adult Lgr5EGFP-IRES-creERT2;Rosa26LSLtdTomato (Lgr5Ctrl) and Lgr5EGFP-IRES-creERT2;Klf5fl/fl;Rosa26LSLtdTomato (Lgr5DELTAKlf5) mice. Mice were injected with tamoxifen to activate Cre recombinase, which deletes Klf5 from the intestinal epithelium in Lgr5DELTAKlf5 but not Lgr5Crtl mice. In experiments involving irradiation, mice were subjected to 12 Gy total body irradiation (TBI). Tissues were collected for immunofluorescence (IF) analysis and next generation sequencing. Oganoids were derived from fluoresecence activated cell sorted- (FACS-) single cells from tamoxifen-treated Lgr5DELTAKlf5 or Lgr5Crtl mice and examined by immunofluorescence stain. Result(s): Lgr5+ ISCs lacking KLF5 proliferate faster than control ISCs but fail to self-renew, resulting in a depleted ISC compartment. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Klf5-null Lgr5+ cells lose ISC identity and prematurely differentiate. Following irradiation injury, which depletes Lgr5+ ISCs, reserve Klf5-null progenitor cells fail to dedifferentiate and regenerate the epithelium. Absence of KLF5 inactivates numerous selected enhancer elements and direct transcriptional targets including canonical WNT- and NOTCH-responsive genes. Analysis of human intestinal tissues showed increased levels of KLF5 in the regenerating epithelium as compared to those of healthy controls. Conclusion(s): We conclude that ISC self-renewal, lineage specification, and precursor dedifferentiation require KLF5, by its ability to regulate epigenetic and transcriptional activities of ISC-specific gene sets. These findings have the potential for modulating ISC functions by targeting KLF5 in the intestinal epithelium.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",Excluded,0.7127703

704,"Mitigation of hematologic radiation toxicity in mice through pharmacological quiescence induced by CDK4/6 inhibition Total body irradiation (TBI) can induce lethal myelosuppression, due to the sensitivity of proliferating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) to ionizing radiation (IR). No effective therapy exists to mitigate the hematologic toxicities of TBI. Here, using selective and structurally distinct small molecule inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK6, we have demonstrated that selective cellular quiescence increases radioresistance of human cell lines in vitro and mice in vivo. Cell lines dependent on CDK4/6 were resistant to IR and other DNA-damaging agents when treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors. In contrast, CDK4/6 inhibitors did not protect cell lines that proliferated independently of CDK4/6 activity. Treatment of wild-type mice with CDK4/6 inhibitors induced reversible pharmacological quiescence (PQ) of early HSPCs but not most other cycling cells in the bone marrow or other tissues. Selective PQ of HSPCs decreased the hematopoietic toxicity of TBI, even when the CDK4/6 inhibitor was administered several hours after TBI. Moreover, PQ at the time of administration of therapeutic IR to mice harboring autochthonous cancers reduced treatment toxicity without compromising the therapeutic tumor response. These results demonstrate an effective method to mitigate the hematopoietic toxicity of IR in mammals, which may be potentially useful after radiological disaster or as an adjuvant to anticancer therapy.",Excluded,0.71276283
183,"Low-dose radiation exposure and protection against atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice: the influence of P53 heterozygosity We recently described the effects of low-dose gamma-radiation exposures on atherosclerosis in genetically susceptible (ApoE(-/-)) mice with normal p53 function. Doses as low as 25 mGy, given at either early or late stage disease, generally protected against atherosclerosis in a manner distinctly nonlinear with dose. We now report the influence of low doses (25-500 mGy) on atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice with reduced p53 function (Trp53(+/-)). Single exposures were given at either low or high dose rate (1 or 150 mGy/min) to female C57BL/6J ApoE(-/-) Trp53(+/-) mice. Mice were exposed at either early stage disease (2 months of age) and examined 3 or 6 months later, or at late stage disease (7 months of age) and examined 2 or 4 months later. In unirradiated mice, reduced p53 functionality elevated serum cholesterol and accelerated both aortic root lesion growth and severity in young mice. Radiation exposure to doses as low as 25 mGy at early stage disease, at either the high or the low dose rate, inhibited lesion growth, decreased lesion frequency and slowed the progression of lesion severity in the aortic root. In contrast, exposure at late stage disease produced generally detrimental effects. Both low-and high-dose-rate exposures accelerated lesion growth and high dose rate exposures also increased serum cholesterol levels. These results show that at early stage disease, reduced p53 function does not influence the protective effects against atherosclerosis of low doses given at low dose rate. In contrast, when exposed to the same doses at late stage disease, reduced p53 function produced detrimental effects, rather than the protective effects seen in Trp53 normal mice. As in the Trp53 normal mice, all effects were highly nonlinear with dose. These results indicate that variations in p53 functionality can dramatically alter the outcome of a low-dose exposure, and that the assumption of a linear response with dose for human populations is probably unwarranted.",Excluded,0.7127622

469,"Oncogenic N-Ras Mitigates Oxidative Stress-Induced Apoptosis of Hematopoietic Stem Cells Leukemic relapse is believed to be driven by transformed hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that harbor oncogenic mutations or have lost tumor suppressor function. Recent comprehensive sequencing studies have shown that mutations predicted to activate Ras signaling are highly prevalent in hematologic malignancies and, notably, in refractory and relapsed cases. To better understand what drives this clinical phenomenon, we expressed oncogenic NrasG12D within the hematopoietic system in mice and interrogated its effects on HSC survival. N-RasG12D conferred a survival benefit to HSCs and progenitors following metabolic and genotoxic stress. This effect was limited to HSCs and early progenitors and was independent of autophagy and cell proliferation. N-RasG12D-mediated HSC survival was not affected by inhibition of canonical Ras effectors such as MEK and PI3K. However, inhibition of the noncanonical Ras effector pathway protein kinase C (PKC) ameliorated the protective effects of N-RasG12D. Mechanistically, N-RasG12D lowered levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which correlated with reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels. Inhibition of PKC restored the levels of ROS to that of control HSCs and abrogated the protective effects granted by N-RasG12D. Thus, N-RasG12D activation within HSCs promotes cell survival through the mitigation of ROS, and targeting this mechanism may represent a viable strategy to induce apoptosis during malignant transformation of HSCs. SIGNIFICANCE: Targeting oncogenic N-Ras-mediated reduction of ROS in hematopoietic stem cells through inhibition of the noncanonical Ras effector PKC may serve as a novel strategy for treatment of leukemia and other Ras-mutated cancers.

This questionnaire survey reveals that the higher the frequency of radiation education, the higher the knowledge of radiation the workers will have, and that the higher the level of knowledge, the lower the anxiety. To reduce anxiety, it is important to increase knowledge about radiation through radiation education. However, even those workers who had radiation education several times still had anxiety. According to the Ordinance on the Prevention of Ionizing Radiation Hazards, the time spent on education about the effects of radiation on the human body is only about 30 minutes.

Cases were those diagnosed with lung cancer over 6 years of follow-up (n = 108). Two controls, matched on age and sex, were selected for each case by incidence density sampling. Of the three polymorphisms, only the XRCC1 Arg280His allele was associated with increased lung cancer risk (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.4) after adjustment for radon and tobacco exposure.

To date, there is little knowledge about the effects of radioactive contamination on tick species. We sampled ticks from vegetation and large-sized wild mammals belonging to orders Carnivora and Artiodactyla at sites with 0.76, 1.91, and 4.50 mSv/hr ionizing radiation background values in the Polesky State Radio-Ecological Reserve of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster zone in spring 2010. Altogether, 122 questing ticks were collected from vegetation. Among collected ticks, Dermacentor reticulatus (Fabricius) was, by far, the most abundant species (99.2%), followed by Ixodes ricnus (L.) (0.8%), which was collected only at the 0.76 mSv/hr site. The average sex ratio female:male was 2.9:1.0. In parallel with the present study, we examined 3 Sus scrofa (L.), 2 Nyctereutes procyonoides (Gray), and 1 Alces alces (L.) at the 4.50 mSv/hr site; 96 D. reticulatus ticks were found on 2 N. procyonoides specimens.

61,"Radiation risks in lung cancer screening programs: a comparison with nuclear industry workers and atomic bomb survivors The National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated that screening with low-dose CT (LDCT) scan reduced lung cancer and overall mortality by 20% and 7%, respectively. The LDCT scanning involves an approximate 2-mSv dose, whereas full-chest CT scanning, the major diagnostic study used to follow up nodules, may involve a dose of 8 mSv. Radiation associated with CT scanning and other diagnostic studies to follow up nodules may present an independent risk of lung cancer. On the basis of the NLST, we estimated the incidence and prevalence of nodules detected in screening programs. We followed the Fleischner guidelines for follow-up of nodules to assess cumulative radiation exposure over 20- and 30-year periods. We then evaluated nuclear worker cohort studies and atomic bomb survivor studies to assess the risk of lung cancer from radiation associated with long-term lung cancer screening programs. The findings indicate that a 55-year-old lung screening participant may experience a cumulative radiation exposure of up to 280 mSv over a 20-year period and 420 mSv over 30 years. These exposures exceed those of nuclear workers and atomic bomb survivors. This assessment suggests that long-term (20-30 years) LDCT screening programs are associated with nontrivial cumulative radiation doses. Current lung cancer screening protocols, if conducted over 20- to 30-year periods, can independently increase the risk of lung cancer beyond cigarette smoking as a result of cumulative radiation exposure. Radiation exposures from LDCT screening and follow-up diagnostic procedures exceed lifetime radiation exposures among nuclear power workers and atomic bomb survivors.",Excluded,0.712754
749,"A minimally invasive assay for individual assessment of the ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity Ionizing radiation induces DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) which activate the ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through transcription of genes including CDKN1A (p21) and BBC3 (PUMA). This pathway prevents genomic instability and tumorigenesis as demonstrated in heritable syndromes (e.g., Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT); Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS)). Here, a simple assay based on gene expression in peripheral blood to measure accurately ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity is described. The expression of p21, Puma and Sesn2 was determined in blood from mice with different gene copy numbers of Atm, Trp53 (p53), Chek2 or Arf and in human blood and mitogen stimulated T-lymphocyte (MSTL) cultures from AT, AT carriers, LFS patients and controls, both before and after ex vivo ionizing irradiation. Mouse Atm/Chek2/p53 activity was highly dependent on the copy number of each gene except Arf. In human MSTL, an AT case, AT carriers and LFS patients showed responses distinct from healthy donors. The relationship between gene copy number and transcriptional induction upon radiation was linear for p21 and Puma and correlated well with cancer incidence in p53 variant mice. This reliable blood test provides an assay to determine ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity and demonstrates the feasibility of assessing the activity of this essential cancer protection pathway in simple assays. These findings may have implications for the individualized prediction of cancer susceptibility. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.",Excluded,0.7127508

We conducted a large case-control study to investigate the association of polymorphisms in ERCC1 C118T, ERCC1 C8092A, XRCC1 A194T, XRCC1 A194T, and XRCC3 C241T, with glioma risk in a Chinese population. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped, using the MassARRAY IPLEX platform, in 443 glioma cases and 443 controls. Association analyses based on an chi2 test and binary logistic regression were performed to determine the odds ratio (OR) and a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each SNP. For XRCC1 Arg194Trp, the variant genotype T/T was strongly associated with a lower risk of glioma cancer when compared with the wild type C/C (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.43-4.45). Individuals carrying the XRCC1 399A allele had an increased risk of glioma (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.02-1.64). The XRCC3 241T/T genotype was associated with a strong increased glioma risk (OR = 3.78, 95% CI = 1.86-9.06). Further analysis of the interactions of two susceptibility-associated SNPs, XRCC1 Arg194Trp and XRCC3 Thr241Met, showed that the combination of the XRCC1 194T and XRCC3 241T alleles brought a large increase in glioma risk (OR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.54-4.04).

90,"Human mononuclear cell in vitro activation in microgravity and post-spaceflight The results of postflight and inflight human in vitro lymphocyte experiments have been reviewed. The cumulative data indicate that mitogen-stimulated T-cell proliferation is blunted following short-duration missions. Since similar responses may also be obtained following exposure to non-spaceflight stressors (hypoxia and academic stress), it is unclear if microgravity per se aggravates this response. Our studies indicate that stress-induced impaired PHA- and PWM-stimulated activation can be detected within the first 24 hours in culture at the level of protein synthesis. While the mechanism for neuroendocrine-mediated blunted mitogen stimulated T cell proliferation has not been elucidated, it is not aggravated by autologous plasma and does not require changes in mononuclear cell subpopulations. While prior studies indicate lymphocyte activation is influenced by altering G forces on in vitro cultures, impaired cellular interactions or suboptimal microenvironments related to reduced cell densities in microgravity may contribute to the greatly impaired mitogen stimulated proliferation responses observed on Spacelab flights. It will be necessary to perform lymphocyte functional assays on crewmembers during spaceflight to determine to contribution of microgravity per se on altered human immune competence.",Excluded,0.7127473

Epidemiologic studies have suggested that arsenic (As) exposure is positively related to increases in blood pressure (BP), a primary CVD risk factor. However, evidence of whether genetic susceptibility can modify the association between As and BP is lacking. In this study, we used mixed effect models adjusted for potential confounders to examine the interaction between As exposure from well water and potential genetic modifiers on longitudinal change in BP over approximately 7. years of follow-up in 1137 subjects selected from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) cohort in Bangladesh. Genotyping was conducted for 235 SNPs in 18 genes related to As metabolism, oxidative stress and endothelial function. We observed interactions between 44 SNPs with well water As for one or more BP outcome measures (systolic, diastolic, or pulse pressure (PP)) over the course of follow-up. The interaction between CYBA rs3794624 and well water As on annual PP remained statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons (FDR-adjusted p for interaction = 0.05). Among individuals with the rs3794624 variant genotype, well water As was associated with a 2.23. mm.

Therapeutical effect was explained by capacity of the preparation to defend the hemopoietic organs from the radiation and to stimulate hemopoiesis. Leucynferon hindered the development of acute radiation sickness symptoms. Immunoreactivity of dogs and guinea pigs in experimental group was more complete and restored faster.

459,"Effect of extracellular pH on GABA-activated current in rat recombinant receptors and thin hypothalamic slices We studied the effects of extracellular pH (pHo) on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated Cl- current in rat hypothalamic neurons and recombinant type-A GABA (GABA(A)) receptors stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293), using whole cell and outside-out patch-clamp recordings. In alpha3beta2gamma2s receptors, acidic pH decreased, whereas alkaline pH increased the response to GABA in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner. Acidification shifted the GABA concentration-response curve to the right, significantly increasing the EC50 for GABA without appreciably changing the slope or maximal current induced by GABA. We obtained similar effects of pH in alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors and in GABA-activated currents recorded from thin hypothalamic brain slices. In outside-out patches recorded from alpha3beta2gamma2 recombinant receptors, membrane patches were exposed to 5 microM GABA at control (7.3), acidic (6.4), or alkaline (8.4) pH. GABA activated main and subconductance states of 24 and 16 pS, respectively, in alpha3beta2gamma2 receptors. Alkaline pH(o) increased channel opening frequency and decreased the duration of the long closed state, resulting in an increase in open probability (from 0.0801 +/- 0.015 in pH 7.3 to 0.138 +/- 0.02 in pH 8.4). Exposure of the channels to acidic pH(o) had the opposite effects on open probability (decreased to 0.006 +/- 0.0001). Taken together, our results indicate that the function of GABA(A) receptors is modulated by extracellular pH. The proton effect is similar in recombinant and native receptors and is dependent on GABA concentration. In addition, the effect appears to be independent of the alpha-subunit isoform, and is due to the ability of H+ to alter the frequency of channel opening. Our findings indicate that GABAergic signaling in the CNS may be significantly altered during conditions that increase or decrease pH.",Excluded,0.7127441

This technique is based on the mating and transfer of ejaculate sperm to the wild female population from released sterile males. This transfer will induce sterility in the female through sperm dominant lethal mutations. Consequently, the factors influencing sperm transfer and sperm storage are issues that must be understood to enable successful SIT implementation. Age, size, nutritional status, copula duration, and irradiation are the most important factors that affect sperm transfer and storage. Inconsistent results from studies investigating the influence of these factors on sperm transfer/storage may be due to, the strain of fly studied and variability in the sexual experience of the flies used.

Moreover, germ line mutations of AML1 were found in an autosomal dominant disease, familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML (FPD/AML), suggesting that AML1 mutants, as well as AML1 chimeras, contribute to the transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. In this report, we showed that AML1 point mutations were found in 6 (46%) of 13 MDS patients among atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors in Hiroshima. Unlike acute or chronic leukemia patients among A-bomb survivors, MDS patients exposed relatively low-dose radiation and developed the disease after a long latency period. AML1 mutations also were found in 5 (38%) of 13 therapy-related AML/MDS patients who were treated with alkylating agents with or without local radiation therapy. In contrast, frequency of AML1 mutation in sporadic MDS patients was 2.7% (2 of 74). Among AML1 mutations identified in this study, truncated-type mutants lost DNA binding potential and trans-activation activity. All missense mutations with one exception (Gly42Arg) lacked DNA binding ability and down-regulated the trans-activation potential of wild-type AML1 in a dominant-negative fashion. The Gly42Arg mutation that was shared by 2 patients bound DNA even more avidly than wild-type AML1 and enhanced the trans-activation potential of normal AML1. These results suggest that AML1 point mutations are related to low-dose radiation or alkylating agents and play a role distinct from that of leukemogenic chimeras as a result of chromosomal translocations caused by sublethal radiation or topoisomerase II inhibitors.",Excluded,0.7127346

Here, we have analysed the mutation frequency at an expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) locus in the germline and bone marrow of the first-generation male offspring of control and irradiated male mice. The frequency of ESTR mutation was studied in the offspring of two reciprocal matings male symbol scid x female symbol BALB/c and male symbol BALB/c x female symbol scid, which were compared with that in BALB/c mice. In the offspring of the BALB/c x BALB/c and male symbol scid x female symbol BALB/c matings, which were conceived after paternal sperm irradiation, the frequency of ESTR mutation was significantly elevated in both tissues. In contrast, ESTR mutation frequency was only slightly elevated in the offspring of male symbol BALB/c x female symbol scid mating conceived after paternal irradiation. The results of this study suggest that the oocytes of scid females are unable to fully support the repair of double-strand breaks induced in paternal sperm which may in turn result in the elimination of cells/embryos containing high levels of DNA damage, thus partially preventing the manifestation of genomic instability.",Excluded,0.71273315
772,"Some radiation effects on segregation in Drosophila Translocation induced in the immature oocyte, in meiotic prophase, affects division I orientation and segregation, the usual result being that the two halves of translocations are directed to opposite poles. Since interchange is usually (if not exclusively) between chromatids, this is to be expected from the creation of illegitimate conjunctions. Good agreement is obtained between patterns of segregations deduced from recovered half-translocation bearing exceptions and the kinds of disomic gametes expected as alternative recoveries from the same division I configurations. Inferences drawn from the study of compound-X females have been found to apply as well in the case of females of normal karyotype. Numerical errors occur predominantly, possibly exclusively, in division I. The rate of induced nondisjunction of specific chromosome pairs varies in relation to the structure of the entire complement, as required if radiation-induced nondisjunction is interchange dependent, but which would be unexpected if the mechanism involved effects on individual spindle fibers, chromosomes, or chromosomal bivalents.",Excluded,0.71273285
875,"Rationale and design of the Japan molecular epidemiology for lung cancer study We present the rationale for the Japan Molecular Epidemiology for Lung Cancer study designed to elucidate molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in smokers and never-smokers with non-small-cell lung cancer. This prospective, ongoing, multicenter study is being conducted nationwide in Japan. Although there is no doubt that active smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, the contribution of other possible factors, including environmental tobacco or wood smoke, human papilloma virus, radon, occupational exposures, and genetic susceptibility, is highly likely, based on studies of never-smokers with non-small-cell lung cancer. Because of the predominance of women in the never-smoker subgroup, the role of female hormones in lung cancer development has also been considered. We hypothesize that driver mutations, which are critical for the development of lung cancer, are triggered by the environmental factors with or without the influence of the hormone. The SWOG-led intergroup molecular epidemiology study S0424 was conducted to focus on these issues by using a detailed questionnaire and specimen collection in statistically significant cohorts of smokers and never-smokers from both sexes. The Japan Molecular Epidemiology for Lung Cancer study follows and extends the S0424 molecular epidemiology concept in principle by using a similar approach that will facilitate future comparisons between the studies but with a greater focus on more recently defined driver mutations and broad genomic sequencing.

These lines of research would benefit from improved germline transmission of transplanted PGCs in chimeric chickens. We therefore evaluated the effects of pretransplant X-irradiation of recipient embryos on the efficacy of germline transmission of donor PGCs in chimeric chickens. Intact chicken eggs were exposed to X-ray doses of 3, 6 and 9 Gy (dose rate = 0.12 Gy/min) after 52 h of incubation. There was no significant difference in hatching rate between the 3-Gy-irradiated group and the nonirradiated control group (40.0 vs. 69.6%), but the hatching rate in the 6-Gy-irradiated group (28.6%) was significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.05). No embryos irradiated with 9 Gy of X-rays survived to hatching. X-irradiation significantly reduced the number of endogenous PGCs in the embryonic gonads at stage 27 in a dose-dependent manner compared with nonirradiated controls. The numbers of endogenous PGCs in the 3-, 6- and 9-Gy-irradiated groups were 21.0, 9.6 and 4.6% of the nonirradiated control numbers, respectively. Sets of 100 donor PGCs were subsequently transferred intravascularly into embryos irradiated with 3 Gy X-rays and nonirradiated control embryos. Genetic cross-test analysis revealed that the germline transmission rate in the 3-Gy-irradiated group was significantly higher than in the control group (27.5 vs. 5.6%; P<0.05).

Method(s): Radioresistant colorectal cancer cell lines were established by repeated X-ray exposure (total, 100 Gy), and the gene expressions of the parent and radioresistant cell lines were compared in a microarray analysis. To verify the microarray data, we carried out a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of identified genes in clinical samples from 30 irradiated rectal cancer patients. Result(s): A comparison of the intensity data for the parent and three radioresistant cell lines revealed 17 upregulated and 142 downregulated genes in all radioresistant cell lines. Next, we focused on two upregulated genes, PTMA (prothymosin alpha) and EIF5a2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A), in the radioresistant cell lines. In clinical samples, the expression of PTMA was significantly higher in the minor effect group than in the major effect group (P = 0.004), but there were no significant differences in EIF5a2 expression between the two groups.

935,"Rapid High-Throughput Diagnostic Triage after a Mass Radiation Exposure Event Using Early Gene Expression Changes Radiological exposure scenarios involving large numbers of people require a rapid and high-throughput method to identify the unexposed, and those exposed to low- and high-dose radiation. Those with high-dose exposure, e.g., >2 Gy and depending on host characteristics, may develop severe hematological acute radiation syndrome (HARS), requiring hospitalization and treatment. Previously, we identified a set of genes that discriminated these clinically relevant groups. In the current work, we examined the utility of gene expression changes to classify 1,000 split blood samples into HARS severity scores of H0, H1 and H2-4, with the latter indicating likely hospitalization. In several previous radiation dose experiments, we determined that these HARS categories corresponded, respectively, to doses of 0 Gy (unexposed), 0.5 Gy and 5 Gy. The main purpose of this work was to assess the rapidity of blood sample processing using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Peripheral blood samples from two healthy donors were X-ray irradiated in vitro and incubated at 37degreeC for 24 h. A total of 1,000 samples were evaluated by laboratory personnel blinded to the radiation dose. Changes in gene expression of FDXR, DDB2, POU2AF1 and WNT3 were examined with qRT-PCR as positive controls. Targeted NGS (TREX) was used on all samples for the same four genes. Agreement using both methods was almost 78%. Using NGS, all 1,000 samples were processed within 30 h. Classification of the HARS severity categories corresponding to radiation dose had an overall agreement ranging between 90-97%. Depending on the end point, either a combination of all genes or FDXR alone (H0 HARS or unexposed) provided the best classification. Using this optimized automated methodology, we assessed 100x more samples approximately three times faster compared to standard cytogenetic studies. We showed that a small set of genes, rather than a complex constellation of genes, provided robust positive (97%) and negative (97%) predictive values for HARS categories and radiation doses of 0, 0.5 and 5 Gy.

Unexpectedly, mHR23B(-/-) mice show impaired embryonic development and a high rate (90%) of intrauterine or neonatal death. Surviving animals display a variety of abnormalities, including retarded growth, facial dysmorphology, and male sterility. Such abnormalities are not observed in XPC and other NER-deficient mouse mutants and point to a separate function of mHR23B in development.

The radiation of Diaptomid species (~400 species) has apparently produced little morphological differentiation other than those in secondary sexual characteristics, suggesting sexual, rather than ecological, selection has driven speciation. This evolutionary history suggests that species, and conspecific populations, would be ecologically redundant but recent work found contrasting ecosystem effects among both species and populations. This study provides the first quantification of shape variation among species, populations, and/or sexes (beyond taxonomic illustrations and body size measurements) to gain insight into the ecological differentiation of Diaptomids. Here we quantify the shape of five Diaptomid species (family Diaptomidae) from four populations each, using morphometric landmarks on the prosome, urosome, and antennae. We partition morphological variation among species, populations, and sexes, and test for phenotype-by-environment correlations to reveal possible functional consequences of shape variation. We found that intraspecific variation was 18-35% as large as interspecific variation across all measured traits. Interspecific variation in body size and relative antennae length, the two traits showing significant sexual dimorphism, were correlated with lake size and geographic location suggesting some niche differentiation between species. Observed relationships between intraspecific morphological variation and the environment suggest that divergent selection in contrasting lakes might contribute to shape differences among local populations, but confirming this requires further analyses.

985,"A new model of biodosimetry to integrate low and high doses Biological dosimetry, that is the estimation of the dose of an exposure to ionizing radiation by a biological parameter, is a very important tool in cases of radiation accidents. The score of dicentric chromosomes, considered to be the most accurate method for biological dosimetry, for low LET radiation and up to 5 Gy, fits very well to a linear-quadratic model of dose-effect curve assuming the Poisson distribution. The accuracy of this estimation raises difficulties for doses over 5 Gy, the highest dose of the majority of dose-effect curves used in biological dosimetry. At doses over 5 Gy most cells show difficulties in reaching mitosis and cannot be used to score dicentric chromosomes. In the present study with the treatment of lymphocyte cultures with caffeine and the standardization of the culture time, metaphases for doses up to 25 Gy have been analyzed. Here we present a new model for biological dosimetry, which includes a Gompertz-type function as the dose response, and also takes into account the underdispersion of aberration-among-cell distribution. The new model allows the estimation of doses of exposures to ionizing radiation of up to 25 Gy. Moreover, the model is more effective in estimating whole and partial body exposures than the classical method based on linear and linear-quadratic functions, suggesting their effectiveness and great potential to be used after high dose exposures of radiation.",Excluded,0.7126947

Most of these tissues were radioprotected, and the degree of radioprotection depended on the dose of WR-2721 and the time interval between administration of WR-2721 and radiation treatment. WR-2721 increased resistance of jejunal epithelial cells and spermatogenic cells to single doses of gamma-rays by factors of 1.64 and 1.54, respectively. Protection against hair loss was less pronounced; the dose-modifying factor here was 1.24. The radiation-induced acute damage of the lung expressed by the increased formation of tumor nodules in the lung was not decreased by treatment of animals with WR-2721 before radiation. In contrast, WR-2721 augmented the radiation-induced enhancement of metastasis formation in the lung.

Ageing leads to decrease of cathepsins activity in rat liver lysosomal fractions. Constant light and darkness conditions result in earlier age decline of cathepsins activity. Absence of day and night succession in comparison with alternating light conditions causes decline of both general and specific cathepsin D activity.

Due, in part, to public concern about a postulated relationship between the use of cellular telephones or other increasingly prevalent environmental exposures and the incidence of brain cancer in adults, the National Cancer Institute is collaborating with three US hospitals in a comprehensive case-control study of malignant and benign brain tumours. Factors under consideration include use of cellular phones and other wireless communication devices, workplace exposures to chemical agents and electromagnetic fields, dietary factors, family history of tumours, genetic determinants of susceptibility, home appliance use, reproductive history and hormonal exposures, viruses, medical and dental exposure to ionising radiation, and other aspects of medical history. Approximately 800 newly diagnosed brain tumour cases and 800 controls were enrolled at hospitals in Boston, Phoenix and Pittsburgh from 1994 to 1998. Cases include all adults (age >= 18 y) newly diagnosed with a histologically confirmed intracranial glioma, histologically confirmed intracranial meningioma or acoustic neuroma.

Material(s) and Method(s): The mosquito, C. pipiens Linnaeus (L) was irradiated as pupae with three gamma doses 40, 60 and 80 Gy. Different biological aspects include the ovarian development of irradiated females tested. Result(s): Gamma doses used significantly increased the larval and pupal mortality percentages, the larval and pupal duration and significantly decreased the adult emergence percentages. Moreover, fecundity and egg hatchability percentages were severely decreased with increasing gamma doses. While the sterility% was positively correlated with the doses used. Gamma doses caused a dose-dependent decrease in the number of developed eggs, reduction in the number of developed oocytes, signs of degenerative processes in oocytes, yolk mass and egg size decrease. Conclusion(s): Results obtained indicated that gamma radiation of C. pipiens induced remarkable effects on the biological, developmental and reproductive activity.© 2018, Copyright © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded,0.7126707

209,"Molecular basis of basal cell carcinogenesis in the atomic-bomb survivor population: p53 and PTCH gene alterations Epidemiological studies suggest that UV exposure from sunlight is the major etiology for skin cancers, both melanocytic and non-melanocytic. However, the radiation-related risk for skin cancer among atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is primarily derived from the excess risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), with no demonstrable excess in squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma. The BCCs in this cohort are therefore unusual in being potentially attributable to two types of radiation - UV and ionizing (IR). BCCs have been associated with PTCH and/or p53 tumor suppressor gene alterations. To investigate the roles of these genes in relation to IR and UV exposures, we analyzed both genes in BCC samples from atomic bomb survivors. We examined 47 tumors, of which 70% had non-silent base-substitution p53 mutations independent of IR or UV exposure. However, the distribution of mutation type depends on UV and/or IR exposure. For example, C-to-T transitions at CpG sites adjacent to pyrimidine-pyrimidine (PyPy) sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-exposed than UV-shielded body areas and CpG-mutations at non-PyPy sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-shielded body areas with high-IR (>=1 Gy) than low-IR (<0.2 Gy) exposure. And notably, although p53 deletion-frequencies demonstrated no IR-dose associations, deletions at the PTCH locus were more frequent (79% versus 44%) in tumors with high-IR than low-IR exposure. Moreover, 60% of high-IR tumors harbored both p53 and PTCH abnormalities compared with 23% of low-IR tumors. Therefore, alteration of both genes is likely to play a role in radiation-induced basal cell carcinogenesis. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",Excluded,0.7126571
283,"Facilitation of somatic calcium channels can evoke prolonged tail currents in rat hypoglossal motoneurons Voltage-dependent persistent inward currents (PICs) make an important contribution to the input-output properties of alpha motoneurons. PICs are thought to be mediated by membrane channels located primarily on the dendrites as evidenced by prolonged tail currents following the termination of a voltage step and by a clockwise hysteresis in the whole cell inward currents recorded in response to depolarizing then repolarizing voltage ramp commands. We report here, however, that voltage-clamp currents with these same features can be generated in isolated somatic membrane patches from rat hypoglossal motoneurons. Long-lasting (200-800 ms) tail currents after 1-s voltage-clamp pulses were observed in nucleated patches from 16 of 23 cells. Further, these somatic PICs display ""facilitation"" in response to conditioning depolarization as previously observed in whole cell recordings from intact neurons. Pharmacological tests suggest that the PICs were primarily mediated by Cav1 channels. Our results show that many of the features of persistent calcium currents recorded from intact motoneurons do not necessarily reflect a remote dendritic origin but can also be ascribed to the intrinsic properties of their Cav1 channels.",Excluded,0.7126465
548,"The human leulocyte test system. VII. Further investigations concerning micronucleus-derived premature chromosome condensation Premature chromosome condensation (PCC) from X-ray induced micronuclei shows a dose-effect relationship in human leukocytes in vitro. Preparations at different culture times without colcemide treatment reveal complex variations of the frequencies of micronuclei and PCC correlated with the fixation time. The positions of PCC patches in the metaphase plate and the frequencies of different PCC types (S and G2) ar independent on the X-ray dose. The latter indicates that the slowing down of the micronuclei in the cell cycle, which is the reason for the formation of PCC, may be an outcome rather of a regulatory phenomenon than of an unspecific physiological damage of the chromatin included in the micronuclei. This is especially evident from labeling experiments with tritiated thymidine, showing that the extent of asynchrony between main nuclei and micronuclei is independent on the X-ray dose. Labeling experiments with tritiated uridine reveal a X-ray dose dependent suppression of RNA synthesis in cells with main nuclei and micronuclei. THE S-phase nature of ""pulverized"" PCC patches could be verified by incorporation of tritiated thymidine in aound 50%.

331,"Mechanism of low-level microwave radiation effect on nervous system The aim of this study is to explain the mechanism of the effect of low-level modulated microwave radiation on brain bioelectrical oscillations. The proposed model of excitation by low-level microwave radiation bases on the influence of water polarization on hydrogen bonding forces between water molecules, caused by this the enhancement of diffusion and consequences on neurotransmitters transit time and neuron resting potential. Modulated microwave radiation causes periodic alteration of the neurophysiologic parameters and parametric excitation of brain bioelectric oscillations. The experiments to detect logical outcome of the mechanism on physiological level were carried out on 15 human volunteers. The 450-MHz microwave radiation modulated at 7, 40 and 1000 Hz frequencies was applied at the field power density of 0.16 mW/cm2. A relative change in the EEG power with and without radiation during 10 cycles was used as a quantitative measure. Experimental data demonstrated that modulated at 40 Hz microwave radiation enhanced EEG power in EEG alpha and beta frequency bands. No significant alterations were detected at 7 and 1000 Hz modulation frequencies. These results are in good agreement with the theory of parametric excitation of the brain bioelectric oscillations caused by the periodic alteration of neurophysiologic parameters and support the proposed mechanism. The proposed theoretical framework has been shown to predict the results of experimental study. The suggested mechanism, free of the restrictions related to field strength or time constant, is the first one providing explanation of low-level microwave radiation effects.",Excluded,0.71264124

Between HNC aetiological groups (HPV positive and HPV negative) clinical evidence demonstrates significantly better treatment response among HPV positive cancers. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are identified in HNC tumour populations as agents of treatment resistance and a target for tumour control. This study examines dynamic responses in populations of a CSC phenotype in HNC cell lines following X-irradiation at therapeutic levels, and comparing between HPV statuses. Variations in CSC density between HPV groups showed no correlation with better clinical outcomes seen in the HPV positive status. CSC populations in HPV positive cell lines ranged from 1.9 to 4.8%, and 2.6 to 9.9% for HPV negative. Following 4Gy X- irradiation however, HPV negative cell lines demonstrated more frequent and significantly greater escalation in CSC proportions, being 3-fold that of the HPV positive group at 72hours post irradiation. CSC proportions of tumour populations are not fixed but subject to change in response to radiation at therapeutic dose levels. These findings imply a potential effect of aetiology on radio-responsiveness in CSCs, illustrating that clonogen treatment response may be more informative of therapy outcomes than inherent population density alone.",Excluded,0.7126336

Due to an inhibitory effect of radiation on cell proliferation the assay yields satisfactory results only when the absorbed dose is below about 5Gy. In 2002 Muller and Rode suggested that a modified version of the test, based on the analysis of the ratio of trinucleated to tetranucleated cells and the frequency of micronuclei (Mn) in binucleated cells containing at least one Mn, can be applied to detect a dose reaching 15Gy (Mutat.

Controversy surrounds the question of whether or not the incidence of lung cancer in never-smokers is increasing, with more data to support this observation in Asia. There are several factors associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer in never smokers including second hand smoke, indoor air pollution, occupational exposures, and genetic susceptibility among others.

948,"Glypican-3-mediated inhibition of CD26 by TFPI: a novel mechanism in hematopoietic stem cell homing and maintenance Directional migration determines hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) homing, which depends upon the interaction between the chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4. CD26 is a widely expressed membrane-bound ectopeptidase that cleaves CXCL12 thereby depleting its chemokine activity. We identified tissue-factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) as a biological inhibitor of CD26 in murine and human HSPCs. We observed low-level TFPI expression in endothelial cells in the bone marrow (BM), which did not increase following radiation injury. Treatment of HSPCs with TFPI in vitro led to enhanced HSPC migration toward CXCL12, as well as homing and engraftment in the BM upon transplantation. We found that Glypican-3 (GPC3), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on murine as well as human HSPCs, mediated this effect. TFPI did not affect CD26 activity, migration, or homing of GPC3(-/-) HSPCs, while it affected GPC1(-/-) HSPCs similar to wild-type HSPCs. Moreover, proliferation of GPC3(-/-) but not GPC1(-/-) BM HSPCs was significantly increased, which was associated with a decrease in the primitive HSC pool in BM and an increase in proportion of the circulating HSPCs in the peripheral blood. Hence, we present a novel role for TFPI and GPC3 in regulating HSC homing as well as retention in the BM.",Excluded,0.7125961

However, other nations have organized space programs over the last 40 yr and the European Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency, the China National Space Administration, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency all offer an opportunity for further study of the mortality of space explorers. METHODS: We used biographical and vital data abstracted from public sources for European, Canadian, Chinese, and Japanese astronauts. Using general population mortality rates from the Human Mortality Database and mortality rates derived from the cohort of U.S. astronauts, we computed standardized mortality ratios. RESULTS: The groups displayed different preferences in selection of astronauts. As there were no deaths in any of the four groups, the point estimates for standardized mortality ratios were all 0. However, the European cohort experienced a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality risk in comparison to the European general population as well as in comparison to U.S. astronauts. DISCUSSION: The healthy worker effect predicts that all study cohorts should have lower all-cause mortality risk in comparison to their general populations. The general population of Japan has mortality rates low enough that any reduction in mortality risk may remain undetectable in the Japanese cohort. Continued surveillance of these populations in the coming decades will make them a useful addition to the evidence base for astronaut mortality. Reynolds RJ, Day SM.

905,"Individual consistency in exploratory behaviour and mating tactics in male guppies While behavioural plasticity is considered an adaptation to fluctuating social and environmental conditions, many animals also display a high level of individual consistency in their behaviour over time or across contexts (generally termed 'personality'). However, studies of animal personalities that include sexual behaviour, or functionally distinct but correlated traits, are relatively scarce. In this study, we tested for individual behavioural consistency in courtship and exploratory behaviour in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in two light environments (high vs. low light intensity). Based on previous work on guppies, we predicted that males would modify their behaviour from sneak mating tactics to courtship displays under low light conditions, but also that the rank orders of courtship effort would remain unchanged (i.e. highly sexually active individuals would display relatively high levels of courtship under both light regimes). We also tested for correlations between courtship and exploratory behaviour, predicting that males that had high display rates would also be more likely to approach a novel object. Although males showed significant consistency in their exploratory and mating behaviour over time (1 week), we found no evidence that these traits constituted a behavioural syndrome. Furthermore, in contrast to previous work, we found no overall effect of the light environment on any of the behaviours measured, although males responded to the treatment on an individual-level basis, as reflected by a significant individual-by-environment interaction. The future challenge is to investigate how individual consistency across different environmental contexts relates to male reproductive success. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded,0.7124274

Tumor and tissue/organ levels of liposome uptake were measured by dissection and quantitation in a gamma counter., RESULTS: For most tissues (tumor, liver, kidney, lung, skin, heart, and central nervous system), irradiation did not alter IDLPL biodistribution. Splenic uptake appeared to be increased by TBI, but further analysis revealed that this effect was due to reduced splenic weight in irradiated mice. IDLPL uptake was increased in the small intestine, stomach, musculoskeletal system, female reproductive tract, and adrenal glands in irradiated mice., CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that concomitant administration of liposomal radiosensitizers during radical radiotherapy is likely to be safe.

Recipient mice were treated for 1 or 7 days with growth factors (stem cell factor [SCF] plus interleukin 11 [IL-11], SCF plus Flt-3 ligand [FL], or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) prior to low-dose TBI (4 Gy). Donor cell chimerism was measured after transplantation of congenic bone marrow cells. High levels of donor cell engraftment were observed in recipients pretreated for 7 days with SCF plus IL-11 or SCF plus FL. Although 1-day pretreatments with these cytokines initially resulted in reduced donor cell engraftment, a continuous increase in time was observed, finally resulting in highly significantly increased levels of donor cell contribution. In contrast, G-CSF treatment showed no beneficial effects on long-term engraftment. In vitro stem cell assays demonstrated the effect of cytokine treatment on stem cell numbers. Donor cell engraftment and number of remaining recipient stem cells after TBI were strongly inversely correlated, except for groups treated for 1 day with SCF plus IL-11 or SCF plus FL. We conclude that long-term donor cell engraftment can be strongly augmented by treatment of recipient mice prior to low-dose TBI with hematopoietic growth factors that act on primitive cells.",Excluded,0.712347
65,"Mortality and cancer registration experience of the Sellafield employees known to have been involved in the 1957 Windscale accident The mortality and cancer morbidity experience of the 470 male Sellafield employees known to be involved in the 1957 Windscale accident is reported. All these employees are known to have been involved in dealing with the fire itself, or in the clean-up operation afterwards. The size of the study population is small, leading to predicted low power to reveal any effects, but the cohort is of interest because of the involvement of the workers in the accident. For 1957-97, using rates for England and Wales to calculate the expected numbers, the all causes standardised mortality ratio (SMR) is 100 (observed = 258, expected = 258.80), and the all malignant neoplasms SMR is 79 (observed = 58, expected = 73.12) which is not significantly different from 100. For 1971-91, the all malignant neoplasms standardised registration ratio (SRR) of 85 (observed = 59, expected = 69.23) is not significantly different from 100. Significant excesses of deaths from diseases of the circulatory system (SMR = 121) and from ischaemic heart disease (SMR = 128), and a significant deficit of deaths from cancer of the genito-urinary organs (SMR = 31), were found. There were no significant differences in mortality rates between workers who had received high recorded external doses during the fire and those who had received low doses, though the power of this comparison was low. Comparison of the mortality rates of workers directly involved in the accident with workers in post, but not so involved, showed no significant differences. This study has been unable to detect any effect of the 1957 fire upon the mortality and cancer morbidity experience of those workers involved in it.",Excluded,0.7122823
462,"Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome) is linked to chromosome 9q34 Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome [AOA]; MIM 208920) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and choreoathetosis. These neurological features resemble those of ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), but in AOA there are none of the extraneurological features of AT, such as immunodeficiency, neoplasia, chromosomal instability, or sensitivity to ionizing radiation. It is unclear whether these patients have a true disorder of chromosomal instability or a primary neurodegenerative syndrome, and it has not been possible to identify the defective gene in AOA, since the families have been too small for linkage analysis. We have identified a new family with AOA, and we show that the patients have no evidence of chromosomal instability or sensitivity to ionizing radiation, suggesting that AOA in this family is a true primary cerebellar ataxia. We have localized the disease gene, by linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping, to a 15.9-cM interval on chromosome 9q34. This work will ultimately allow the disease gene to be identified and its relevance to other types of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias to be determined.",Excluded,0.7121214
733,"The effect of exposure duration on the biological activity of mobile telephony radiation In the present experiments we studied the effects of different durations of a single (continuous), daily exposure, ranging from 1 min up to 21 min, to the two established systems of digital mobile telephony radiation that are commonly used in Europe, viz. GSM 900 MHz (Global System for Mobile telecommunications) and DCS 1800 MHz (Digital Cellular System-referred to also as GSM 1800 MHz), on a well-tested biological model, the reproductive capacity of the insect Drosophila melanogaster. The insects were exposed to each type of radiation at an intensity of about 10 microW/cm(2), corresponding to a distance of 20 or 30 cm from the antenna of a DCS 1800 or a GSM 900 mobile phone handset, respectively. At these distances the bioactivity of mobile telephony radiation was found to be at a maximum due to the existence of a ""window"" of increased bioactivity around this value, as we have shown recently [1-4]. The results show that the reproductive capacity decreases almost linearly with increasing exposure duration to both GSM 900 and DCS 1800 radiation, suggesting that short-term exposures to these radiations have cumulative effects on living organisms. Additionally, our results show again that GSM 900 MHz radiation is slightly more bioactive than DCS 1800 MHz radiation, at the same exposure durations and under equal radiation intensities, as shown in our previous experiments [5].

502,"Radiosensitivity: Gender and Order of Administration of G-CSF, An Experimental Study in Mice To elucidate the potential influence of stimulating bone marrow before cell-cycle-dependent irradiation, we sought to determine overall survival in mice receiving total-body irradiation (TBI) when administered granulocyte stimulating factor (G-CSF) at different time points. Gender differences were also studied. C57/BL/6J mice, aged 9-14 weeks, received 8 Gy TBI in a perspex cage using a linear accelerator. In each of five different experiments, three groups were studied: 1. one control group receiving TBI only; 2. one group treated with filgrastim [500 lg/kg subcutaneously/intraperitoneally (s.c./i.p.)] the day before TBI, followed by daily filgrastim injections postirradiation (1-5 days); and 3. one group treated with daily filgrastim injections only post-TBI (1-5 days). Each experimental group included male and female mice. Survival of the mice was monitored daily, and mice were euthanized when their condition deteriorated. A total of 293 mice were monitored for at least 37 days post-TBI. Control mice that received 8 Gy TBI showed a significant gender difference, with a median survival of 22 days in females and 17 days in males. Addition of G-CSF, irrespective of pre- or postirradiation, significantly improved survival, but in males the improvement was significantly better when G-CSF was not given before TBI. Improved survival in females was independent of the order of administration of GCSF. Multiple filgrastim injections were more effective than a single injection, and s.c. administration was not better than i.p. In conclusion, these findings indicate that male mice are more sensitive to TBI than females. Filgrastim improved survival in both genders irrespective of whether given pre- or postirradiation, but in males the improvement was significantly less if an injection was given before irradiation. These results suggest that, to prevent toxicity most effectively, GCSF should not be given before cytotoxic therapy. While a completely different experimental model was used here, these results may also be extrapolated to indicate that endocrine cell-cycle suppression therapy should not be given before or during cytotoxic therapy of hormone-dependent tumors (e.g., breast and prostate cancer), thus a reduction in the efficacy of cell-cycle-dependent therapy can be prevented.Copyright © 2019 by Radiation Research Society.

1127,"Innovations in applied decision theory for health and safety Objectives There are established methods for occupational epidemiological cohort analysis, such as proportional hazards regression, that are well suited to aetiological research and yield parameter estimates that allow for succinct communication among academics. However, these methods are not necessarily well suited for evaluation of health impacts of policy choices and communication to decision makers. An informed decision about a policy that impacts health and safety requires a valid estimate of the policy's potential impact. Methods We propose methods for data summarisation that may facilitate communication with managers, workers and their advocates. We calculate measures of effect in a framework for competing events, graphically display potential impacts on cause-specific mortality under policy alternatives and contrast these results to estimates obtained using standard Poisson regression methods. Methods are illustrated using a cohort mortality study of 28 546 Ontario uranium miners hired between 1950 and 1996 and followed through 2007. Results A standard regression analysis yields a positive association between cumulative radon progeny exposure and all-cause mortality (log(RR per 100 WLM)=0.09; SE=0.02). The proposed method yields an estimate of the expected gain in life expectancy (approximately 6 months per worker) and reduction of 261 lung cancer deaths under a policy that eliminated occupational radon progeny exposure. Conclusions The proposed method shifts attention from covariate-adjusted risk ratios or rate ratios to estimates of deaths that are avoided or delayed under a potential policy. The approach may help inform decision-making and strengthen the connection of epidemiological approaches to data analysis with developments in decision theory and systems engineering to improve health and safety.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

904,"Impact of various parameters in detecting chromosomal aberrations by FISH to describe radiosensitivity BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Analysis of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations is regarded as the ""gold standard"" for classifying individual radiosensitivity. A variety of different parameters can be used. The crucial question, however, is to explore which parameter is suited best to describe the differences between patients with increased radiosensitivity and healthy individuals., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, five patients with severe radiation-induced late effects of at least grade 3, classified according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), and eleven healthy individuals were examined retrospectively. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were irradiated in vitro with 0.7 Gy and 2.0 Gy prior to cultivation and stained by means of three-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The detailed analysis was focused on the number of breaks per metaphase, on breaks from complex chromosomal rearrangements per metaphase, as well as on the percentage of translocations, dicentric chromosomes, breaks, and excess acentric fragments-each in comparison with the total number of mitoses analyzed., RESULTS: Using the number of breaks from complex chromosomal rearrangements after 2.0 Gy, radiosensitive patients as endpoint were clearly to be distinguished (p = 0.001) from healthy individuals. Translocations (p = 0.001) as well as breaks per metaphase (p = 0.002) were also suitable indicators for detecting differences between patients and healthy individuals. The parameters ""percentage of dicentric chromosomes"", ""breaks"", and ""excess acentric fragments"" in comparison to the total number of mitoses analyzed could neither serve as meaningful nor as significant criteria, since they showed a strong interindividual variability., CONCLUSION: To detect a difference in chromosomal aberrations between healthy and radiosensitive individuals, the parameters ""frequency of breaks per metaphase"", ""complex chromosomal rearrangements"", and ""translocations"" are most suitable.",Excluded,0.71160686
918,"Pathogen reduction by ultraviolet C light effectively inactivates human white blood cells in platelet products BACKGROUND: Residual white blood cells (WBCs) in cellular blood components induce a variety of adverse immune events, including nonhemolytic febrile transfusion reactions, alloimmunization to HLA antigens, and transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). Pathogen reduction (PR) methods such as the ultraviolet C (UVC) light-based THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system were developed to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infection. As UVC light targets nucleic acids, it interferes with the replication of both pathogens and WBCs. This preclinical study aimed to evaluate the ability of UVC light to inactivate contaminating WBCs in platelet concentrates (PCs)., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The in vitro and in vivo function of WBCs from UVC-treated PCs was compared to that of WBCs from gamma-irradiated and untreated PCs by measuring cell viability, proliferation, cytokine secretion, antigen presentation in vitro, and xenogeneic GVHD responses in a humanized mouse model., RESULTS: UVC light was at least as effective as gamma irradiation in preventing GVHD in the mouse model. It was more effective in suppressing T-cell proliferation (>5-log reduction in the limiting dilution assay), cytokine secretion, and antigen presentation than gamma irradiation., CONCLUSIONS: The THERAFLEX UV-Platelets (MacoPharma) PR system can substitute gamma irradiation for TA-GVHD prophylaxis in platelet (PLT) transfusion. Moreover, UVC treatment achieves suppression of antigen presentation and inhibition of cytokine accumulation during storage of PCs, which has potential benefits for transfusion recipients.

829,"Masking responses to light in period mutant mice Masking is an acute effect of an external signal on an overt rhythm and is distinct from the process of entrainment. In the current study, we investigated the phase dependence and molecular mechanisms regulating masking effects of light pulses on spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. The circadian genes, Period1 (Per1) and Per2, are necessary components of the timekeeping machinery and entrainment by light appears to involve the induction of the expression of Per1 and Per2 mRNAs in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). We assessed the roles of the Per genes in regulating masking by assessing the effects of light pulses on nocturnal locomotor activity in C57BL/6J Per mutant mice. We found that Per1-/- and Per2-/- mice had robust negative masking responses to light. In addition, the locomotor activity of Per1 -/-/Per2-/- mice appeared to be rhythmic in the light-dark (LD) cycle, and the phase of activity onset was advanced (but varied among individual mice) relative to lights off. This rhythm persisted for 1 to 2 days in constant darkness in some Per1-/-/Per2-/- mice. Furthermore, Per1-/-/Per2-/- mice exhibited robust negative masking responses to light. Negative masking was phase dependent in wild-type mice such that maximal suppression was induced by light pulses at zeitgeber time 14 (ZT14) and gradually weaker suppression occurred during light pulses at ZT16 and ZT18. By measuring the phase shifts induced by the masking protocol (light pulses were administered to mice maintained in the LD cycle), we found that the phase responsiveness of Per mutant mice was altered compared to wild-types. Together, our data suggest that negative masking responses to light are robust in Per mutant mice and that the Per1-/-/Per2-/- SCN may be a light-driven, weak/damping oscillator.

284,"Hypoxia-inducible factor pathway inhibition resolves tumor hypoxia and improves local tumor control after single-dose irradiation Purpose To study the effects of BAY-84-7296, a novel orally bioavailable inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activity, on hypoxia, microenvironment, and radiation response of tumors. Methods and Materials UT-SCC-5 and UT-SCC-14 human squamous cell carcinomas were transplanted subcutaneously in nude mice. When tumors reached 4 mm in diameter BAY-84-7296 (Bayer Pharma AG) or carrier was daily administered to the animals. At 7 mm tumors were either excised for Western blot and immunohistologic investigations or were irradiated with single doses. After irradiation animals were randomized to receive BAY-84-7296 maintenance or carrier. Local tumor control was evaluated 150 days after irradiation, and the dose to control 50% of tumors (TCD50) was calculated. Results BAY-84-7296 decreased nuclear HIF-1alpha expression. Daily administration of inhibitor for approximately 2 weeks resulted in a marked decrease of pimonidazole hypoxic fraction in UT-SCC-5 (0.5% vs 21%, P<.0001) and in UT-SCC-14 (0.3% vs 19%, P<.0001). This decrease was accompanied by a significant increase in fraction of perfused vessels in UT-SCC-14 but not in UT-SCC-5. Bromodeoxyuridine and Ki67 labeling indices were significantly reduced only in UT-SCC-5. No significant changes were observed in vascular area or necrosis. BAY-84-7296 before single-dose irradiation significantly decreased TCD50, with an enhancement ratio of 1.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.72) in UT-SCC-5 and of 1.55 (95% CI 1.26-1.94) in UT-SCC-14. BAY-84-7296 maintenance after irradiation did not further decrease TCD50. Conclusions BAY-84-7296 resulted in a marked decrease in tumor hypoxia and substantially reduced radioresistance of tumor cells with the capacity to cause a local recurrence after irradiation. The data suggest that reduction of cellular hypoxia tolerance by BAY-84-7296 may represent the primary biological mechanism underlying the observed enhancement of radiation response. Whether this mechanism contributes to the improved outcome of fractionated chemoradiation therapy warrants further investigation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.71102554

Moreover, we evaluated the relationship between lymphocyte activation and the observed changes in immunoregulatory functions following ECP treatments. We enrolled 19 SSc patients, who received 12 ECP treatments in total. Blood samples were taken prior to the first therapy and 6 weeks after each cycle. Samples were also obtained from 16 healthy controls. Lymphocyte subgroups were quantified by flow cytometry. Initially, patients had higher numbers and percentages of peripheral CD95+ T cells, but not CD95+ B cells, compared to control values. After ECP treatments, values of CD95+ T cells decreased and became similar to controls. Annexin V expression on T and B cells did not change during the therapy. We observed a significant negative correlation between the changes in percentages of peripheral CD95+ T cells and CD4+CD25 + Treg cells. Although neither early-activated (CD69+) nor lateactivated (HLA-DR+) T lymphocytes showed significant changes after ECP, clear negative correlations developed between them and the functional ability of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells after the last treatment. Our results indicate that the initial increase of CD95+ expression in SSc presumably reflects a physiological response to the pronounced autoimmune processes, which can be effectively attenuated by the restoration of regulative T cell numbers and functions as the result of ECP therapy. © Clinical Rheumatology 2012.",Excluded,0.709742

969,"A new recombined double low restorer line for the Ogu-INRA cms in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) A major objective of breeders using the Ogu-INRA cytoplasmic male sterility (cms) system in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is to obtain double low restorer lines with a shorter introgression and a good agronomic value. The development of low glucosinolate content (low GC) restorer lines often occurs through the deletion of a part of the introgression. One of these lines has lost the radish Pgi-2 allele expression, without recovering that of the rapeseed Pgi-2 allele. This line shows a defect in the meiotic transmission of the restorer gene Rfo and a very poor agronomic value. We initiated a programme to force non-spontaneous recombination between this Rfo-carrying introgression and the rapeseed homologous chromosome from a low GC B. napus line. Gamma ray irradiation was used to induce chromosome breakage just prior meiosis aiming at just such a recombination. Low GC cms plants were crossed with the pollen of irradiated plants that were heterozygous for this introgression. The F 2 families were scored for their vigour, transmission rate of Rfo and female fertility. One family of plants, R2000, showed an improved behaviour for these three traits. This family presented a unique combination of molecular markers when compared to other rapeseed restorers analysed, which suggests that the recombination event allowed the recovery of B. oleracea genetic information that was originally replaced by the radish introgression in the original restorers. This resulted in a duplicated region (originating from radish and B. oleracea) on the chromosome carrying the introgression in the R2000 family. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",Excluded,0.70371217
72,"Effects of a static magnetic field on audiogenic seizures in black Swiss mice Effects of a static magnetic field (SMF) with strong gradient components were studied in black Swiss mice. Exposure to SMF (100-220 mT, 15-40 T/m for 1h) did not affect the threshold for detecting auditory brainstem responses. Serial seizures elevated the hearing threshold at some frequencies, but there was no difference between SMF-exposed and unexposed control mice. EEG changes were recorded during audiogenic seizures. Pretreatment with SMF prolonged seizure latency in response to stimulation with white noise of increasing intensity from 74 to 102 dBA (1 min interval between 2 and 4 dBA increments) without significant effects on seizure severity. Gender-related differences were not statistically significant. Stimulation with 10 min sound steps revealed prolongation of latency and reduction of seizure severity in SMF-exposed, but not unexposed, mice. Pretreatment with phenytoin (5 mg/kg) in combination with SMF had significantly greater effects on seizure latency and severity than either pretreatment alone. These findings indicate that the SMF studied here under different conditions elevated seizure threshold and had anticonvulsant properties in Black Swiss mice and increased the efficacy of a conventional anticonvulsant drug.",Excluded,0.7021567

Of the latter, changes in solar radiation and geomagnetic activities may contribute to the frequency and the seasonal pattern of suicides., METHODS: We studied with a population-based, nationwide analysis all the individuals who committed suicide (n=27,469) in Finland during the period of 1979 to 1999. The daily data on the number of suicides, and the mean and maximum levels of geomagnetic activity were compiled and modelled with Poisson regression using the number of inhabitants in each province as the denominator. Time series analysis of monthly numbers of suicides was carried out using a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure., RESULTS: There was a strong seasonal effect on suicide occurrence (P<0.00001), the risk of suicide being greatest in spring. The seasonal effect was most pronounced when the number of suicides was relatively low. High levels of solar radiation activity were associated with the increased risk of suicide (P=0.00001), but the effect of geomagnetic activity was weak., LIMITATIONS: No individual data on alcohol consumption or mental disorders were available., CONCLUSIONS: Suicide occurrence varies markedly by season and needs attention where prevention is concerned.",Excluded,0.7010174

649,"Cataract and latitude For many years, it has been suggested that exposure to sunlight, particularly its ultraviolet component, may be associated with an increased risk of senile cataract. This paper addresses 1) the physical and geographic variables that affect the entry of ultraviolet light in the eye; 2) the epidemiologic evidence that associates cataract with ultraviolet light exposure; and 3) the effectiveness of personal barrier protection (i.e. sunglasses and hats) in reducing ocular exposure to ultraviolet light. The epidemiologic evidence is drawn from studies in Australia, China, Tibet, and the United States. The U.S. evidence consists of data from the Maryland Watermen study and analyses of cataract surgery under the Medicare program which provides health insurance for nearly all Americans age 65 and over (30 million) and pays for 85% of the 1.3 million cataract extractions performed annually in the U.S. Analysis of the Medicard data shown that, after controlling for age, sex, and race, and income of the population and also controlling for supply of ophthalmologists, optometrists, price of surgery and local practice costs, the strongest predictor of cataract surgery likelihood in a Medicare beneficiary is the person's latitude of residence. Latitude correlates directly with the UV-B content of sunlight, because the incident angle of the sun determines the atmospheric penetration of ultraviolet radiation. Data suggest that the probability of cataract surgery in the U.S. increases by 3% for each 1 degree decrease (i.e. more Southerly) in latitude.",Excluded,0.69098663

We investigated physicians' perception on effectiveness of lung cancer screening depending on screening modality, selection criteria for subjects of screening, types of equipment used to screen, and perception for seriousness of adverse effects following the test. In addition, odds ratios to underestimate risk of radiation exposure from screening were calculated through logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: Each response that chest X-ray is effective for lung cancer screening and that smoking history is not considered prior to screening recommendation accounted for more than 60% of respondents, suggesting the chance of unnecessary screening tests. Regarding adverse effects of lung cancer screening, about 85% of respondents replied that false positive, radiation exposure, and overdiagnosis could be ignored. About 70% of respondents underestimated radiation dose from lung cancer screening, and a low proportion of physicians informed patients of radiation exposure risk., CONCLUSIONS: It was found that most physicians underestimated harms of lung cancer screening including radiation exposure and were lack of awareness regarding lung cancer screening.

691,"Flow cytometry-based assay for determination of teleost cytotoxic cell lysis of target cells BACKGROUND: The nonradiometric assays previously developed to detect cellular cytotoxic activity have been hindered by many difficulties. Among the problems are the requirement for expensive commercial kits and the use of techniques that produce high background noise and decreased sensitivity. In addition, these assays did not account for bidirectional apoptosis (activation-induced cell death [AICD]). Most attempts to derive cytometry-based cytotoxicity assays have been unsuccessful because individual effectors and targets could not be identified (i.e., ""separated"") using gating techniques., METHODS: In the present study, teleost nonspecific cytotoxic (NCC) and mammalian target cells were each sufficiently different in size to identify them by flow cytometry (FCM). Using appropriate gating and discriminator techniques, these two cell populations were differentiated based on scatter properties and propidium iodide (PI) binding. Total capacity for PI binding was obtained by permeabilization of the targets with ice-cold acetone. Spontaneous PI binding was relatively low. This technique detected cytotoxicity at effector-to-target ratios (E:T) of 1:1 and after only 30 min cocultivation., RESULTS: Tilapia NCC from peripheral blood kill human transformed target cells by necrosis and apoptosis as identified by PI binding. Maximum killing of HL-60 targets (approximately 100%) occurred by 180 min cocultivation. For the same time, the killing of IM-9 did not exceed 60%. Almost 90% of IM-9 targets are lysed following 14 h of cocultivation. The maximum killing of both HL-60 and IM-9 targets was observed at a 25:1 E:T ratio after 14 h. Comparisons of the chromium(>51) release assay with flow detection of cytotoxicity revealed that FCM detected 55% lysis of the target cells compared with 2% cytotoxicity by chromium release, after a cocultivation time of 240 min., DISCUSSION: FCM detection of (teleost) NCC lysis of target cells using PI uptake is more sensitive than standard chromium release assays. This level of sensitivity was observed because NCC and targets were sufficiently different in size such that they could be resolved by scatter plots. Using FCM, cytotoxicity was detected earlier and at lower E:T ratios than previously reported for chromium release assays. Although tilapia were reported previously to be not capable of lysing IM-9 targets by chromium release detection, the more sensitive method of FCM detected cytotoxicity using PI uptake. HL-60 lysis by tilapia NCC exhibited saturable kinetics but occurred at different times post-cocultivation. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded,0.6847763
1061,"Design, construction, and in vivo feasibility of a positioning device for irradiation of mice brains using a clinical linear accelerator and intensity modulated radiation therapy Purpose: The goal of this study was to design a positioning device that would allow for selective irradiation of the mouse brain with a clinical linear accelerator. Method(s): We designed and fabricated an immobilization fixture that incorporates three functions: head stabilizer (through ear bars and tooth bar), gaseous anesthesia delivery and scavenging, and tissue mimic/bolus. Cohorts of five mice were irradiated such that each mouse in the cohort received a unique dose between 1000 and 3000 cGy. DNA damage immunohistochemistry was used to validate an increase in biological effect as a function of radiation dose. Mice were then followed with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Result(s): There was evidence of DNA damage throughout the brain proportional to radiation dose. Radiation-induced damage at the prescribed doses, as depicted by H&E, appeared to be constrained to the white matter consistent with radiological observation in human patients. The severity of the damage correlated with the radiation dose as expected. Conclusion(s): We have designed and manufactured a device that allows us to selectively irradiate the mouse brain with a clinical linear accelerator. However, some off-target effects are possible with large prescription doses.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded,0.6750071

1103,"Association between SNPs in defined functional pathways and risk of early or late toxicity as well as individual radiosensitivity BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pathways involved in the ROS pathway, DNA repair, or TGFB1 signaling on acute or late normal toxicity as well as individual radiosensitivity., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients receiving breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy were examined either for erythema (n = 83), fibrosis (n = 123), or individual radiosensitivity (n = 123). The 17 SNPs analyzed are involved in the ROS pathway (GSTP1, SOD2, NQO1, NOS3, XDH), DNA repair (XRCC1, XRCC3, XRCC6, ERCC2, LIG4, ATM) or TGFB signaling (SKIL, EP300, APC, AXIN1, TGFB1). Associations with biological and clinical endpoints were studied for single SNPs but especially for combinations of SNPs assuming that a SNP is either beneficial or deleterious and needs to be weighted., RESULTS: With one exception, no significant association was seen between a single SNP and the three endpoints studied. No significant associations were also observed when applying a multi-SNP model assuming that each SNP was deleterious. In contrast, significant associations were obtained when SNPs were suggested to be either beneficial or deleterious. These associations increased, when each SNP was weighted individually. Detailed analysis revealed that both erythema and individual radiosensitivity especially depend on SNPs affecting DNA repair and TGFB1 signaling, while SNPs in ROS pathway were of minor importance., CONCLUSION: Functional pathways of SNPs may be used to form a risk score allowing to predict acute and late radiation-induced toxicity but also to unravel the underlying biological mechanisms.",Excluded,0.664848
169,"Quantification of the chromosomal radiation damage induced by labelling of leukocytes with [18F]FDG Introduction: The aim of our work is to quantify the radiation damage in lymphocytes after labelling with [18F]FDG. Comparison with gold standard [99mTc]HMPAO labelling is established. An approach to cellular dosimetry is proposed. Method(s): Mixed leukocytes were separated from fresh venous blood and labelled with [18F]FDG and [99mTc]HMPAO following published guidelines. Cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay was performed for both sets of experiments. Tests for quality control of labelling described in guidelines were followed. Cellular dosimetry was calculated according to MIRD. Result(s): MN scored after labelling with 37. MBq of [18F]FDG were 956 +/- 172 and 347 +/- 26 for [99mTc]HMPAO (p < 0.05). Absorbed dose in cell nucleus was of 0.23. Gy for [18F]FDG and 0.08. Gy for [99mTc]HMPAO labelling. The CBMN assay after labelling with ~ 290 MBq of [18F]FDG showed radiation induced inhibition of proliferation capacity of the lymphocytes, confirmed by proliferation study. Conclusion(s): [18F]FDG labelling of mixed leukocytes causes severe radiation damage to the cell, higher than with [99mTc]HMPAO in accordance with the absorbed dose. Labelling of mixed leukocytes for clinical purpose induces high cytotoxicity reflected in the loss of proliferation capacity in lymphocytes this statement allows us to consider a low oncogenic risk however the association between MN formation in the PBL and subsequent risk of cancer is not well established. Advances in knowledge: This is the first work about radiation damage with [18F]FDG labelled cells. We focused on [18F]FDG labelling of leukocytes due to the growing number of research and review articles about this technique. Implications for patient care: The possibility of an increased risk of lymphoid malignancies associated with the administration of radiolabelled lymphocytes is a very controversial subject. Studies on radiation damage on new labelling procedures as the one exposed in this work must be considered.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc..",Excluded,0.65870154

1078,"IL-10 IS DOWN-REGULATED IN THE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES SUSPECTED PATIENTS, INDEPENDENT OF ANGIOGRAPHY IL-10 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) are the important anti and pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively, which may participate in the cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. Additionally, environmental factors, such as the X-ray, can modulate cytokine expression. Due to the fact that X-ray is used during angiography, hence, angiography may alter expression of the cytokines., OBJECTIVE: Accordingly, this project was aimed to assess IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels within cardiovascular patients (with and without vessel stenosis) versus healthy controls and also the effects of angiography on the serum levels of the cytokines., MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was performed on the 80 participants, including twenty cases in each group (healthy controls and cardiovascular patients without vessel stenosis, stenosis of 1 vessel and stenosis of more than 1 vessel) to evaluate IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels using ELISA technique. The IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels also compared within group 2, 3 and 4 before and after angiography to explore the effects of the technique on the IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels., RESULTS: IL-10, but not IFN-gamma, serum levels were higher in the healthy controls than all cardiovascular patients. IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels were not altered after angiography and also were not differ in the smoker versus non- smoker and opium consuming versus non-opium consuming participants., CONCLUSION: Due to the results it may be concluded that IL-10 can be considered as a plausible inhibitor of cardio- vascular diseases independent of angiography duration and X-ray, however, IFN-gamma has no effects in the Iranian patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases.

526,"Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test in river buffalo cells treated with Furocoumarins Cytogenetic test can be very useful to detect chromosome (genome) fragility in both animal and human cells. Furocoumarin derivatives constitute a class of compounds widely investigated for the development of photo-chemotherapeutic drugs and effective in treating many diseases. The interest inside this research field originated from the effectiveness of PUVA therapy, realized by oral or topical administration of a linear furocoumarin (psoralen) followed by irradiation with UVA light, for the treatment of psoriasis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Furocoumarins are also present in Psoralea plants elected to be also used as alternative feed for animals considering that it's a perennial leguminous and, more important, it's green during the summer time. In the present study we report the preliminary results obtained using the SCE-test in river buffalo cells exposed in vitro to furocoumarin extracts from a Sardinian population of Posoralea morisana (L.) Stirton (Punta Giglio,). Peripheral blood samples from five young river buffaloes (2 males and 3 females) were incubated at 38 degreeC for 72 h in presence of different quantities of furocoumarin extracts: 0 (control), 50, 100, 200 and 400 mug/ml. Thirty cells for each cell culture (and furocoumarin dose) were analyzed. Although the cell growth appeared normal in both treated and untreated (control) cells, a significant (P<0.01) higher number of SCEs observed in treated cells, compared to those achieved in the control. On the basis of these results, cells from five river buffalo cows were treated with 0 (control), 100 and 200 mug/ml of furocoumarins for only 3 h after 24 h of incubation, in presence and absence of S9.

324,"Genetic variants in inflammation-related genes are associated with radiation-induced toxicity following treatment for non-small cell lung cancer Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is often accompanied by the development of esophagitis and pneumonitis. Identifying patients who might be at increased risk for normal tissue toxicity would help in determination of the optimal radiation dose to avoid these events. We profiled 59 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 37 inflammation-related genes in 173 NSCLC patients with stage IIIA/IIIB (dry) disease who were treated with definitive radiation or chemoradiation. For esophagitis risk, nine SNPs were associated with a 1.5- to 4-fold increase in risk, including three PTGS2 (COX2) variants: rs20417 (HR:1.93, 95% CI:1.10-3.39), rs5275 (HR:1.58, 95% CI:1.09-2.27), and rs689470 (HR:3.38, 95% CI:1.09-10.49). Significantly increased risk of pneumonitis was observed for patients with genetic variation in the proinflammatory genes IL1A, IL8, TNF, TNFRSF1B, and MIF. In contrast, NOS3:rs1799983 displayed a protective effect with a 45% reduction in pneumonitis risk (HR:0.55, 95% CI:0.31-0.96). Pneumonitis risk was also modulated by polymorphisms in anti-inflammatory genes, including genetic variation in IL13. rs20541 and rs180925 each resulted in increased risk (HR:2.95, 95% CI:1.14-7.63 and HR:3.23, 95% CI:1.03-10.18, respectively). The cumulative effect of these SNPs on risk was dose-dependent, as evidenced by a significantly increased risk of either toxicity with an increasing number of risk genotypes (P,0.001). These results suggest that genetic variations among inflammation pathway genes may modulate the development of radiation-induced toxicity and, ultimately, help in identifying patients who are at an increased likelihood for such events. 2010 Hildebrandt et al.",Excluded,0.63791126
949,"Muscle injury following experimental intraoperative irradiation The paraaortic region of beagle dogs was irradiated to 15 to 55 Gy intraoperative irradiation, 10 to 47.5 Gy intraoperative irradiation following 50 Gy external beam irradiation in 25 fractions, or 50 to 80 Gy external beam irradiation in 30 fractions. Six MeV electrons were used for intraoperative irradiation, and external beam irradiation was done using photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. The psoas muscle in the irradiation field was examined histomorphometrically 2 or 5 years after irradiation. The percentage of muscle fibers and capillaries decreased, whereas the percentage of connective tissue increased with increased dose for both intraoperative irradiation only and intraoperative irradiation plus external beam irradiation. The dose causing a 50% decrease in the percentage of muscle fibers was 21.2 Gy and 33.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone, and 22.9 Gy and 25.2 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. The ED50 for severe vessel lesions was 19.2 Gy and 25.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone and 16.0 Gy and 18.0 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. External beam irradiation alone caused a slight decrease in percentage of muscle fibers with increased dose, and vessel lesions were infrequent or mild. Radiation-induced muscle injury was characterized by loss of muscle fibers, decreased fiber size, severe vessel lesions, hemorrhage, inflammation, coagulation necrosis, and fibrosis. These histopathologic characteristics distinguish this muscle injury from that caused by neurogenic atrophy. These data indicate that radiation-induced muscle injury most likely was caused by injury of the supporting vasculature. The lesions produced were largely a function of the single intraoperative dose rather than the external beam fractionated doses. Furthermore, it appears that 20 to 25 Gy intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation may be near the maximum tolerated dose by sublumbar musculature and its supporting vasculature.",Excluded,0.62650627

Objective(s): Parameters determining the individual protective effect of a pharmacological intervention were investigated. Design and Participants: Biokinetics of 123I was evaluated in 27 healthy volunteers (aged 22-46 yr, median 25 yr, in total 48 assessments) twice in a baseline measurement of the undisturbed kinetics and in an intervention assessment 48 h later. Intervention(s): Seven regimens using single doses of potassium iodide (KI) or sodium perchlorate (SP) at different times relative to exposure were compared: 100 mg KI (-24, 2, 8, 24 h), 100 mg SP (2 h), or 1 g SP (2, 8 h). Main Outcome Measure(s): Different drugs and dosages and the influence of individual parameters of iodine kinetics should be tested.

1064,"Nrf2 activation protects against solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation in mice and humans The transcription factor Nrf2 determines the ability to adapt and survive under conditions of electrophilic, oxidative, and inflammatory stress by regulating the expression of elaborate networks comprising nearly 500 genes encoding proteins with versatile cytoprotective functions. In mice, disruption of Nrf2 increases susceptibility to carcinogens and accelerates disease pathogenesis. Paradoxically, Nrf2 is upregulated in established human tumors, but whether this upregulation drives carcinogenesis is not known. Here we show that the incidence, multiplicity, and burden of solar-simulated UV radiation-mediated cutaneous tumors that form in SKH-1 hairless mice in which Nrf2 is genetically constitutively activated are lower than those that arise in their wild-type counterparts. Pharmacologic Nrf2 activation by topical biweekly applications of small (40 nmol) quantities of the potent bis(cyano enone) inducer TBE-31 has a similar protective effect against solar-simulated UV radiation in animals receiving long-term treatment with the immunosuppressive agent azathioprine. Genetic or pharmacologic Nrf2 activation lowers the expression of the pro-inflammatory factors IL6 and IL1beta, and COX2 after acute exposure of mice to UV radiation. In healthy human subjects, topical applications of extracts delivering the Nrf2 activator sulforaphane reduced the degree of solar-simulated UV radiation-induced skin erythema, a quantifiable surrogate endpoint for cutaneous damage and skin cancer risk. Collectively, these data show that Nrf2 is not a driver for tumorigenesis even upon exposure to a very potent and complete carcinogen and strongly suggest that the frequent activation of Nrf2 in established human tumors is a marker of metabolic adaptation.Copyright © 2015 American Association for Cancer Research.",Excluded,0.5980296
917,"Sunlight exposure and cardiovascular risk factors in the REGARDS study: A cross-sectional split-sample analysis Background: Previous research has suggested that vitamin D and sunlight are related to cardiovascular outcomes, but associations between sunlight and risk factors have not been investigated. We examined whether increased sunlight exposure was related to improved cardiovascular risk factor status. Method(s): Residential histories merged with satellite, ground monitor, and model reanalysis data were used to determine previous-year sunlight radiation exposure for 17,773 black and white participants aged 45+ from the US. Exploratory and confirmatory analyses were performed by randomly dividing the sample into halves. Logistic regression models were used to examine relationships with cardiovascular risk factors. Result(s): The lowest, compared to the highest quartile of insolation exposure was associated with lower high-density lipoprotein levels in adjusted exploratory (-2.7 mg/dL [95% confidence interval: -4.2, -1.2]) and confirmatory (-1.5 mg/dL [95% confidence interval: -3.0, -0.1]) models. The lowest, compared to the highest quartile of insolation exposure was associated with higher systolic blood pressure levels in unadjusted exploratory and confirmatory, as well as the adjusted exploratory model (2.3 mmHg [95% confidence interval: 0.8, 3.8]), but not the adjusted confirmatory model (1.6 mg/dL [95% confidence interval: -0.5, 3.7]). Conclusion(s): The results of this study suggest that lower long-term sunlight exposure has an association with lower high-density lipoprotein levels. However, all associations were weak, thus it is not known if insolation may affect cardiovascular outcomes through these risk factors. © 2014 Kent et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded,0.5777263

The objective of our study was to determine whether the 2 dose components are sufficiently well correlated to enable estimating total dose from blood work alone. Methods Data were examined retrospectively for all pts studied from 2004 - 2015. An uncollimated gamma camera measured anterior & posterior counts (corrected for background & decay & calibrated by I-131 standards) 6 times over 5 days after administration of 37-74 MBq I-131 to estimate dose to blood from gamma emissions (Dgamma). Blood was sampled within 10 min of each camera measurement, well counter counts of which estimated dose to blood from beta emissions (Dbeta). Adding these 2 estimates provided total dose (DT) to blood forming organs, adjusted for body habitus. Predicted total dose (DP) was obtained from Dbeta alone by linear regression. Conventional MPA was computed as 200 rad/DT & predicted MPA as 200 rad/DP. Results There were 62 pts (age = 61+/-12 yrs; 30 female; 32 male), of whom 2 were studied twice & 3 were studied 3 times, for a total of 68 measurements. DT was progressively larger for pts studied multiple times (rank correlation rho = 0.39, p = 0.004). DP was computed as = -0.005+1.473* Dbeta, & correlated strongly with DT (r = 0.98, p < 0.0001; intercept = 0.04+/-0.02, p = 0.09; slope = 0.95+/-0.02, p < 0.0001), with similar means (0.76+/-0.51 versus 0.76+/-0.52 rad/mCi, paired t-test p = 0.96).

Each subject underwent 31 short-term phases of weightlessness and hypergravity induced by parabolic flight as a spaceflight analogue. At baseline, 1 and 24 h after parabolic flight, venous blood was withdrawn. Analysis of circulating miRNAs in serum was conducted by means of next generation sequencing. In total, 213 miRNAs were robustly detected (TPM > 5) by small RNA sequencing in all 24 samples. Four miRNAs evidenced a significant change in expression after adjusting for multiple testing.

Prominent afterhyperpolarizations that follow action potentials in these neurons strongly affect their excitability. In the present work, we have investigated the regulation of the afterhyperpolarizing current (I(AHP)) by protein kinase C (PKC). Electrophysiological responses and protein translocation were investigated in AH neurons of freshly dissected preparations of myenteric ganglia from the guinea-pig ileum. The activator of conventional and novel PKCs, phorbol dibutyrate, but not the activator of novel PKCs, ingenol, blocked the I(AHP). Phorbol dibutyrate had no effect on the hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) or on the A current (I(A)). Stimulation of synaptic inputs to the neurons also reduced the I(AHP), and had no effect on I(h) or I(A). Phorbol dibutyrate also reduced a background outward current that was present after the I(AHP) current had been blocked by clotrimazole. Both phorbol dibutyrate and ingenol caused translocation of the novel PKC, PKCepsilon, in these neurons. Only phorbol dibutyrate caused translocation of PKCgamma, a conventional PKC. The studies thus indicate that the activation of PKC by phorbol esters and by nerve stimulation affects AH neurons in a similar way, and that PKC activation targets both the I(AHP) and another background K(+) current. The I(AHP) is targeted by a conventional PKC, suggested to be PKCgamma, as this is the only conventional PKC that is prominent in AH neurons.",Excluded,0.5154398

BMC of the femur midshaft, representing cortical bone, apparently increased progressively with advancing age. The width of the femur at the scan site also increased with age. Normalizing the midshaft BMC by width partially compensated for the age-associated increase. However, when bone mineral values were normalized by the cortical area at the scan site, to take into account the geometric differences in the femurs of different aged animals, maximum bone densities were found in the mature adult and these values decreased slightly in the femurs from senescent rats. In contrast, the BMC of the femur distal metaphysis, representing trabecular bone, decreased markedly in the aged rat. The loss of trabecular bone was also evident from morphological examination of the distal metaphysis. These findings indicated that bone mineral loss with age was site specific in the rat femur.
