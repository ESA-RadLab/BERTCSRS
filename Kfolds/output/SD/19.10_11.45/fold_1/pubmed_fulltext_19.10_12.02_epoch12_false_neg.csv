41,"Does Vacuum-assisted Closure Reduce the Risk of Wound Complications in Patients With Lower Extremity Sarcomas Treated With Preoperative Radiation? BACKGROUND: Although preoperative radiation followed by wide local excision yields excellent local control in soft tissue sarcomas, the risk of wound complications is reported to be higher compared with the incidence in patients who were administered postoperative radiation therapy. Vacuum (vac)-assisted closure may improve wound healing, but it is unknown whether vac-assisted closure during soft tissue sarcoma resection may reduce the risk of wound complications or impair local disease control., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does the use of a wound vac application at the time of soft tissue sarcoma resection reduce the risk of developing wound complications after lower extremity sarcoma resection? (2) Is vac-assisted closure associated with an increased risk of local relapse?, METHODS: From 2000 to 2016, 312 patients with stage I to III soft tissue sarcomas were treated. Of these, 123 were treated with preoperative radiation +/- chemotherapy followed by limb-sparing resection based on tumor location, size, grade, histology, and patient age. There was a minimum followup of 12 months. Radiation was delivered generally based on tumor size, grade, superficial versus deep nature, and proximity to neurovascular structures. Chemotherapy was administered in patients < 70 years old with high-grade tumors and tumors > 5 cm. Patient, demographic, and treatment variables, including incisional vac application and wound outcomes, were retrospectively evaluated. Incisional vac-assisted closure took place at the time of primary resection in 32% (46 of 123) of patients. Vac-assisted closure was considered when there was a concern for risk of external contamination such as instances in which fixation of adhesives would be difficult or regions where there was a high risk of contamination. Vac-assisted closure may have also been used in instances with increased wound tension at closure or with heightened concern for shearing on the wound such as buttock wounds. Ten patients were lost to followup, two in the vac group and eight in the non-vac group. Potential factors associated with wound complications were evaluated using Fisher's exact test for univariate analysis and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. Local recurrence-free survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate., RESULTS: After taking into consideration factors such as tumor size, location, age, and patient comorbidities, it was shown that patients who underwent vac-assisted closure were less likely to experience wound complications compared with patients who did not undergo vac-assisted closure (odds ratio, 0.129; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.041-0.398; p = 0.004). The local control incidence in the entire cohort was 98%. With the numbers available, Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from local recurrence did not differ between patients treated with or without the vac (100% [95% CI, 154.09-154.09] versus 96% [95% CI, 152.21-169.16]; p = 0.211), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Vac-assisted closure at the time of resection of proximal lower extremity soft tissue sarcomas is associated with a lower risk of wound complications, and its use apparently did not compromise local control. We show that the use of vac-assisted closure may be worth considering in surgeons' attempts to reduce the risk of wound complications among patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the proximal lower extremities., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.",Included,0.4330753
79,"A system for focal intracavitary irradiation of bladder cancer with remote iridium-192 afterloading An afterloading system for remote-control focal intracavitary irradiation of bladder cancer is presented. With 192Ir as radiation source, we demonstrated the practicability of the method in 23 chinchilla rabbits. A system for focal intracavitary irradiation of bladder cancer in humans was developed. A guiding tube with an inflatable balloon led to a reproducible vesical diameter. The intravesical part of the tube was shielded with lead and had a slit for focal radiation exposure. Three variant guiding tubes with different positions of the slit were designed to allow irradiation of any part of the bladder. The application is planned in patients with locally advanced tumors who refuse radical cystectomy or who are medically inoperable.",Included,0.4405586
214,"Diagnostic medical radiation in inflammatory bowel disease: Primum non-nocere? Background and Aims Patients with Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) are frequently exposed to diagnostic medical radiation for the diagnosis and evaluation of their disease. Despite increasing awareness of the potentially serious downstream effects, few studies have quantified radiation exposure in IBD patients. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 225 consecutive patients attending IBD clinics at our hospital. Clinical data including demographics, disease characteristics and therapy were obtained from case note and electronic patient record review. All incidences of diagnostic medical radiation from initial diagnosis until 30 June 2010 inclusive were recorded from case note and computerised radiology database system review. The radiation dose for each procedure was obtained from published tables from the Royal College of Radiologists, UK. Effective dose for each procedure was calculated by multiplying this value by the number of procedures during the study period. The sum of doses received was the cumulative effective dose. Results One hundred and two of the 225 IBD patients reviewed were female, 123 were male. The median age was 48 (Range 17-88) and mean disease duration 9.8 years. One hundred and four patients had Crohn's disease, 113 patients had ulcerative colitis and 8 patients had an indeterminate colitis. The mean and median cumulative effective radiation doses were 11.35 mSv and 5.12 mSv respectively. A cumulative radiation dose greater than 10 mSv was seen in 40.9% (92) patients and greater than 25 mSv in 12.9% (29) patients. In 9 patients the cumulative effective dose was greater than 50 mSv. Crohn's disease was associated with a higher cumulative effective dose with exposure exceeding 10 mSv in 60.6%, 25 mSv in 22.1% and 50 mSv in 8.7% patients respectively. CT imaging accounted for 43% and barium studies for 32% of the total cumulative effective dose exposure. Thirty-nine patients had small bowel magnetic resonance (MR) studies as an alternative to ionising radiation in the last 3 years. Conclusions Patients with IBD, particularly those with Crohn's disease are exposed to significant amounts of diagnostic medical radiation in their lifetime. The increased risk of cancer from cumulative radiation coupled with the inherent risk of colorectal malignancy in long standing IBD and the potential for immunomodulator drugs such as azathioprine to increase the risk of cancers (e.g. lymphoma) is of great clinical and public health concern. Clinicians must remain vigilant to these risks when evaluating these patients and radiation exposure should be minimised and when possible alternatives such as intestinal ultrasound and MR imaging should be preferred.",Included,0.44785
455,"Faecal microbiota transplantation protects against radiation-induced toxicity Severe radiation exposure may cause acute radiation syndrome, a possibly fatal condition requiring effective therapy. Gut microbiota can be manipulated to fight against many diseases. We explored whether intestinal microbe transplantation could alleviate radiation-induced toxicity. High-throughput sequencing showed that gastrointestinal bacterial community composition differed between male and female mice and was associated with susceptibility to radiation toxicity. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) increased the survival rate of irradiated animals, elevated peripheral white blood cell counts and improved gastrointestinal tract function and intestinal epithelial integrity in irradiated male and female mice. FMT preserved the intestinal bacterial composition and retained mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression profiles of host small intestines in a sex-specific fashion. Despite promoting angiogenesis, sex-matched FMT did not accelerate the proliferation of cancer cells in vivo. FMT might serve as a therapeutic to mitigate radiation-induced toxicity and improve the prognosis of tumour patients after radiotherapy.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

505,"Radiation-Induced Myocardial Fibrosis in Long-Term Esophageal Cancer Survivors Purpose: Radiation-induced cardiac toxicity is a potential lethal complication. The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a dose-dependent relationship between radiation dose and myocardial fibrosis in patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) for esophageal cancer (EC). Methods and Materials: Forty patients with EC treated with a transthoracic esophagectomy with (n = 20) or without (n = 20) nCRT (CROSS study regimen) were included. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 Tesla) for left ventricular (LV) function, late gadolinium enhancement, and T1 mapping were performed. Extracellular volume (ECV), as a surrogate for collagen burden, was measured for all LV segments separately. The dose-response relationship between ECV and mean radiation dose per LV myocardial segment was evaluated using a mixed-model analysis. Result(s): Seventeen nCRT and 16 control patients were suitable for analysis. The mean time after treatment was 67.6 +/- 8.1 (nCRT) and 122 +/- 35 (controls) months (P = .02). In nCRT patients, we found a significantly higher mean global ECV of 28.2% compared with 24.0% in the controls (P < .001). After nCRT, LV myocardial segments with elevated ECV had received significantly higher radiation doses. In addition, a linear dose-effect relation was found with a 0.136% point increase of ECV for each Gy (P < .001). There were no differences in LV function measures and late gadolinium enhancement between both groups. Conclusion(s): Myocardial ECV was significantly higher in long-term EC survivors after nCRT compared with surgery only. Moreover, this ECV increase was linear with the radiation dose per LV segment, indicating radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",Included,0.45146257
508,"[Local recurrence of rectal cancers. Multidimensional analysis by anatomoclinical factors and role of irradiation] Pre- or postoperative radiation therapy reduces the incidence of local recurrence after surgical treatment of rectal carcinoma. Factors related to local recurrence were analyzed retrospectively by uni- and multivariate analysis. One hundred and fifty-five patients (mean age: 65 years) were operated on with curative intent between 1967 and 1984. Ninety-four patients (46 patients having abdominoperineal resections (APR), and 48 having anterior resections) did not receive radiation therapy. Sixty-one patients had preoperative radiation therapy followed by APR in 59 cases. Univariate analysis showed that the risk of local recurrence increased significantly with male sex (p less than 0.006), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), vascular invasion (p less than 0.02), and Astler-Coller classification (p less than 0.05). Tumor located at less than 5 cm from the anal verge was significantly related to recurrence only in patients not receiving radiation therapy (p less than 0.02). Multivariate analysis including therapeutic modalities showed that local recurrence was significantly related with male sex (p less than 0.02), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), and distance to anal verge (p less than 0.01). The beneficial role of radiation therapy appeared only for tumors located 5 cm or less from the anal verge. Prognostic scores were established using these variables and the effect of irradiation was evaluated according to these scores. Radiation therapy significatively reduced the risk of local recurrence in low-risk patients, i.e., female with low-lying tumor and with negative lymph nodes (p less than 0.03).

699,"Gamma irradiation. An effective procedure for bone banks, but does it make sense from an osteobiological perspective? BACKGROUND: Bone grafts promote bone healing by supplying a three-dimensional structure that supports bone ingrowth. Autologous bone therefore still remains the ""gold standard"" for grafts. Unfortunately, autologous bone grafts are associated with an increased morbidity. In order to avoid such problems, intensive research has been carried out on alternative materials such as allogeneic bone. However, its use is dependent on bone banks and its availability is limited. Gamma irradiation is now becoming established as a procedure for inactivating bacteria, fungal spores and viruses. Its effects on the biomechanical properties of bone have been analyzed in numerous studies. However, the current literature provides little information as to the effects of gamma sterilization on the osteobiology of allogeneic bone grafts., PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gamma-sterilized bone grafts on immunocompetent cells by an in vitro model (a culture of human bone marrow cells)., METHODS: We decided to use the model of human bone marrow cells in culture for the in vitro analysis because the physiological conditions in the human body can best be simulated in this model and the observed reactions are applicable to humans., RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: In sum, we found a maximum immune response in gamma-irradiated bone grafts, which, interpreted as a sole result, must be seen as a negative biological effect. However, in view of the good clinical results for gamma-sterilized bone grafts other influences would seem to be the determining factors in clinical outcome. Further research is needed to gain a more exact understanding of these factors.",Included,0.45503893
1029,"Outcomes of Radiotherapy for Osseous Echinococcosis of Meriones meridianus Background: Osseous cyst echinococcosis (CE) is an infectious disease that causes disability and deformity in patients, yet there is still no satisfactory treatment. Focusing on the feasibility and prognosis of radiotherapy as an adjuvant or palliative treatment for osseous CE, this study investigated the outcome of Meriones meridianus with osseous CE after radiotherapy., Methods: The study utilized a comparison control group design with three groups of gerbils, and 240 osseous CE gerbils were randomly divided into control, 40Gy/5times, and 50Gy/5times groups. Different doses of radiotherapy were given to the gerbils, and then, the effects of radiotherapy on gerbils and lesions were observed at 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy. Statistical analysis was done using chi 2 test, unpaired t-test, and one-way ANOVA., Results: Significant changes (P < 0.05) were achieved between the three groups in terms of seven parameters at 3 and 6 months, including the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, number of dead scolices, protein content, Ca2+ concentration, the maximum diameter of lesion site, and wet weight of cysts. Except for the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, all other parameters were observed a big difference between 3 months and 6 months in the 50Gy/5times group., Conclusion: Radiotherapy at a dose of 50 Gy has inhibitory and therapeutic effects on osseous CE in gerbils, and radiotherapy could probably be a treatment option for persistent or recurrent osseous CE.

363,"Risk of cataract extraction among adult retinoblastoma survivors Objective: To investigate the risk of cataract extraction among adult retinoblastoma survivors. Design(s): A retrospective cohort study was performed on retinoblastoma survivors who received the diagnosis from 1914 to 1984 and were interviewed in 2000. Lens doses were estimated from radiotherapy records. The cumulative time interval to cataract extraction between dose groups was compared using the log-rank test and Cox regression. Result(s): Seven hundred fifty-three subjects (828 eyes) were available for analysis for an average of 32 years of follow-up. During this period, 51 cataract extractions were reported. One extraction was reported in an eye with no radiotherapy compared with 36 extractions in 306 eyes with 1 course of radiotherapy and 14 among 38 eyes with 2 or 3 treatments. The average time interval to cataract extraction in irradiated eyes was 51 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 48-54) following 1 treatment and 32 years (95% CI, 27-37) after 2 or 3 treatments. Eyes exposed to a therapeutic radiation dose of 5 Gy or more had a 6-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.3-27.2) of cataract extraction compared with eyes exposed to 2.5 Gy or less. Conclusion(s): The results emphasize the importance of ophthalmologic examination of retinoblastoma survivors who have undergone radiotherapy. The risk of cataract extraction in untreated eyes with retinoblastoma is comparable with the risk of the general population. ©2009 American Medical Association.

546,"The maximum tolerated dose of gamma radiation to the optic nerve during gamma knife radiosurgery in an animal study BACKGROUND: The safety of gamma knife radiosurgery should be considered when treating pituitary adenomas., OBJECTIVES: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation delivered by gamma knife radiosurgery to optic nerves., METHODS: An animal model designed to establish prolonged balloon compression of the optic chiasm and parasellar region was developed to mimic the optic nerve compression caused by pituitary adenomas. Twenty cats underwent surgery to place a balloon for compression effect and 20 cats in a sham operation group received microsurgery without any treatment. The effects of gamma knife irradiation at 10-13 Gy on normal (sham operation group) and compressed (optic nerve compression group) optic nerves were investigated by pattern visual evoked potential examination and histopathology., RESULTS: Gamma knife radiosurgery at 10 Gy had almost no effect. At 11 Gy, P100 latency was significantly prolonged and P100 amplitude was significantly decreased in compressed optic nerves, but there was little change in the normal optic nerves. Doses of 11 Gy and higher induced significant electrophysiological variations and degeneration of the myelin sheath and axons in both normal and compressed optic nerves., CONCLUSIONS: Compressed optic nerves are more sensitive to gamma knife radiosurgery than normal optic nerves. The minimum dose of gamma knife radiosurgery that causes radiation injury in normal optic nerves is 12 Gy; however, the minimum dose is 11 Gy in compressed optic nerves. Copyright © 2013 S.

836,"The risk of cataractogenesis after gamma knife radiosurgery: a nationwide population based case-control study BACKGROUND: Medical radiation is considered a factor responsible for cataractogenesis. However, the incidence of this ophthalmologic complication resulting from gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has not yet been reported. The present study aimed to determine the risk of cataractogenesis associated with radiation exposure from GKRS., METHODS: This study used information from a random sample of one million persons enrolled in the nationally representative Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The GK group consisted of patients who underwent GKRS between 2000 and 2009. The non-GK group was composed of subjects who had never undergone GKRS, but who were matched with the case group for time of enrollment, age, sex, history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes., RESULTS: There were 277 patients in the GK group and 2770 matched subjects in the non-GK group. The GK group had a higher overall incidence of cataracts (10.11% vs. 7.26%; crude hazard ratio [cHR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.07-2.36; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.25; 95% CI, 0.82-1.90) than the non-GK group. Patients who had undergone computed tomography and/or cerebral angiography (CT/angio) studies had a higher risk of developing cataracts than those who did not (10.82% vs. 6.64%; cHR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.31-2.30; aHR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.22-2.23). The age group between 30 and 50 years had the highest risk of cataractogenesis in both the GK and CT/angio groups (cHR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.58-7.72; aHR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.02-5.81; cHR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.47-5.99; aHR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.05-4.93, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation exposure due to GKRS and CT/angio study may be independently associated with increased risk of cataractogenesis. We suggest routine dosimetry measurement of eye lens and proper protection for patients with benign lesions during GKRS. Regular follow-up imaging studies should avoid the use of CT/angio, and particular care should be taken in the 30-50-year-old age group, due to their significantly increased risk of cataract formation.",Included,0.45526108
1191,"Protection of radiation-induced damage to the hematopoietic system, small intestine and salivary glands in rats by JNJ7777120 compound, a histamine H4 ligand Based on previous data on the histamine radioprotective effect on highly radiosensitive tissues, in the present work we aimed at investigating the radioprotective potential of the H4R ligand, JNJ7777120, on ionizing radiation-induced injury and genotoxic damage in small intestine, salivary glands and hematopoietic tissue. For that purpose, rats were divided into 4 groups. JNJ7777120 and JNJ7777120-irradiated groups received a daily subcutaneous JNJ7777120 injection (10 mg/kg) starting 24 h before irradiation. Irradiated groups received a single dose of 5 Gy on whole-body using Cesium-137 source and were sacrificed 3 or 30 days after irradiation. Tissues were removed, fixed, stained with hematoxylin and eosin or PAS staining and histological characteristics were evaluated. Proliferative and apoptotic markers were studied by immunohistochemistry, while micronucleus assay was performed to evaluate DNA damage. Submandibular gland (SMG) function was evaluated by methacholine-induced salivation. Results indicate that JNJ7777120 treatment diminished mucosal atrophy and preserved villi and the number of crypts after radiation exposure (240+/-8 vs. 165+/-10, P<0.01). This effect was associated to a reduced apoptosis and DNA damage in intestinal crypts. JNJ7777120 reduced radiation-induced aplasia, preserving medullar components and reducing formation of micronucleus and also it accelerated bone marrow repopulation. Furthermore, it reduced micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood (27+/-8 vs. 149+/-22, in 1,000 erythrocytes, P<0.01). JNJ7777120 completely reversed radiation-induced reduced salivation, conserving glandular mass with normal histological appearance and reducing apoptosis and atrophy of SMG. JNJ7777120 exhibits radioprotective effects against radiation-induced cytotoxic and genotoxic damages in small intestine, SMG and hematopoietic tissues and, thus, could be of clinical value for patients undergoing radiotherapy.",Included,0.45533067
451,"Generation of a Transcriptional Radiation Exposure Signature in Human Blood Using Long-Read Nanopore Sequencing In the event of a large-scale event leading to acute ionizing radiation exposure, high-throughput methods would be required to assess individual dose estimates for triage purposes. Blood-based gene expression is a broad source of biomarkers of radiation exposure which have great potential for providing rapid dose estimates for a large population. Time is a crucial component in radiological emergencies and the shipment of blood samples to relevant laboratories presents a concern. In this study, we performed nanopore sequencing analysis to determine if the technology can be used to detect radiation-inducible genes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The technology offers not only long-read sequencing but also a portable device which can overcome issues involving sample shipment, and provide faster results. For this goal, blood from nine healthy volunteers was 2 Gy ex vivo X irradiated. After PBMC isolation, irradiated samples were incubated along with the controls for 24 h at 37degreeC. RNA was extracted, poly(A)+ enriched and reverse-transcribed before sequencing. The data generated was analyzed using a Snakemake pipeline modified to handle paired samples. The sequencing analysis identified a radiation signature consisting of 46 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which included 41 protein-coding genes, a long non-coding RNA and four pseudogenes, five of which have been identified as radiation-responsive transcripts for the first time. The genes in which transcriptional expression is most significantly modified after radiation exposure were APOBEC3H and FDXR, presenting a 25-and 28-fold change on average, respectively. These levels of transcriptional response were comparable to results we obtained by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. In vivo exposure analyses showed a transcriptional radioresponse at 24 h postirradiation for both genes together with a strong dose-dependent response in blood irradiated ex vivo. Finally, extrapolating from the data we obtained, the minimum sequencing time required to detect an irradiated sample using APOBEC3H transcripts would be less than 3 min for a total of 50,000 reads. Future improvements, in sample processing and bioinformatic pipeline for specific radiation-responsive transcript identification, will allow the provision of a portable, rapid, real-time biodosimetry platform based on this new sequencing technology. In summary, our data show that nanopore sequencing can identify radiation-responsive genes and can also be used for identification of new transcripts.Copyright © 2020 by Radiation Research Society.

Additionally, cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell apoptosis were all analyzed in irradiated or sham-irradiated cells., RESULTS: Among the five antisense compounds (AS), AS3 was identified to efficiently inhibit p53 mRNA level and protein content. Interestingly, AS3 transfer has little effect on cell proliferation in DU-145 cells (mutant p53) after ionizing radiation (IR). In contrast, a marked increase of cell apoptosis and growth inhibition were observed in MCF-7 cells (wild-type p53), suggesting that AS3 can increase radiosensitivity of MCF-7 cells. Additionally, it was also observed that the transfection of AS3 decreased the fraction of G1 phase cells, and increased the proportion of S phase cells compared to untreated cells 24 h after IR in MCF-7 cell lines., CONCLUSION: AS3 transfection increases MCF-7 cell apoptosis induced by 5 Gy-radiation, and this mechanism may be closely associated with abrogation of G1 phase arrest.",Included,0.45536813
202,"MiR-19 in blood plasma reflects lung cancer occurrence but is not specifically associated with radon exposure Radon is one of the most powerful carcinogens, particularly in terms of lung cancer onset and development. miRNAs may be considered not only as markers of the ongoing tumorigenesis but also as a hallmark of exposure to radiation, including radon and its progeny. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to estimate the value of plasma miR-19b-3p level as the prospective marker of the response to radon exposure in lung cancer pathogenesis. A total of 136 subjects were examined, including 49 radon-exposed patients with lung cancer, 37 patients with lung cancer without radon exposure and 50 age/sex matched healthy controls. Total RNA from blood samples was extracted and used to detect miR-19b-3p expression via reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction. The 2-DELTADELTACq method was used to quantify the amount of relative miRNA. The plasma level of p53 protein was determined using a Human p53 ELISA kit. Plasma miR-19b-3p level was significantly higher in the patients with lung cancer groups, compared with the healthy control group (P<0.0001). No other statistically significant differences were determined in the expression level of plasma miR-19b-3p between patients diagnosed with lung cancer exposed to radon and not exposed to radon. The expression level of free circulating miR-19b-3p was higher in the group of non-smoking patients with lung cancer, compared with smokers with lung cancer. The miR-19b-3p was 1.4-fold higher in non-smokers than in smokers (P<0.05). No association between plasma levels of p53 protein and miR-19b-3p freely circulating in patients with lung cancer was observed. No other statistically significant differences were determined in the plasma p53 protein level between patients diagnosed with lung cancer exposed and not exposed to radon. These results indicated that detection of miR-19b-3p levels in plasma potentially could be exploited as a noninvasive method for the lung cancer diagnostics. However, this miRNA is not suitable as the precise marker for radon impact.Copyright © 2018, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included,0.4553985
908,"The age-dependent effect of high-dose X-ray radiation on NFkappaB signaling, structure, and mechanical behavior of the intervertebral disc Purpose: Ionizing radiation damages tissue and provokes inflammatory responses in multiple organ systems. We investigated the effects of high-dose X-ray radiation on the molecular inflammation and mechanical function of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Methods: Functional spine units (FSUs) containing the vertebrae-IVDs-vertebrae structure extracted from 1-month, 6-month, and 16-month-old NFkappaB-luciferase reporter mice and from 6-month-old myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-null mice. After a preconditioning period in culture, the FSUs were subjected a single dose of ionizing X-ray radiation at 20 Gys, and then NFkappaB expression was monitored. The IVDs were then subjected to mechanical testing using dynamic compression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, and histological analyses. Results: In the 1-month-old FSUs, the NFkappaB-driven luciferase activity was significantly elevated for 1 day following the exposure to radiation. The 6-month-old FSUs showed increased NFkappaB activity for 3 days, while the 16-month-old FSUs sustained elevated levels of NFkappaB activity throughout the 10-day culture period. All irradiated groups showed significant loss of disc height, GAG content, mechanical function and changes in structure. Ablation of MyD88 blunted the radiation-mediated NFkappaB signaling, and preserved GAG content, and the IVDs' structure and mechanical performance. Conclusions: These results suggest that high-dose radiation affects the IVDs' NFkappaB-dependent inflammatory processes that subsequently lead to functional deterioration. Blocking the transactivation potential of NFkappaB via MyD88 ablation preserved the structure and mechanical function of the FSUs. The long-term effects of radiation on IVD homeostasis should be considered in individuals susceptible to occupational and medical exposure.",Included,0.45540914

An estimate of the collective effective dose and the number of fatal malignancies as well as a calculation of the monies which could be justifiably spent in reducing the collective effective dose and hence the number of fatal malignancies by a shift from photofluorography to ""full size"" radiography will be given.",Included,0.4554127
434,"Intravascular radiation accelerates atherosclerotic lesion formation of hypercholesteremic rabbits OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of intravascular radiation (IR) on the arterial wall of uninjured vessels in the hypercholesteremic rabbit model., METHODS: Aortas of 24 New Zealand white rabbits were treated with either intravascular 192-Ir gamma-radiation (15 Gy at 2 mm from the center of the source) or were exposed to the source catheter without radiation (sham controls). Following the radiation treatment, the animals were fed a 2% cholesterol diet until euthanasia at 2 (n=8) or 6 (n=16) weeks. Arteries were analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM); transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) 1, a promoter of connective tissue deposition, was also monitored., RESULTS: At 2 weeks, SEM analysis showed well-aligned endothelial cells in nonradiated segments, whereas irradiated arteries consistently contained adherent and subendothelial macrophages with focal areas of endothelial disruption. Further radiated segments at 2 weeks showed a 7-fold increase in active TGF beta-1 over nonradiated segments. At 6 weeks, there was a significant increase in plaque and vessel wall area relative to control arteries, however, no differences were noted in the density of actin-positive smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or macrophages. Similarly, no differences were noted in cell proliferation between groups as evidenced by the marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). In contrast, nonirradiated segments frequently contained cellular areas with extracellular lipid., CONCLUSION: Exposure of previously uninjured vessels to IR and hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased plaque burden and leads to more advanced plaque types. Special care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure in normal vascular segments in hypercholesterolemic patients undergoing radiation therapy.",Included,0.4554162
1122,"Cohort profile: four early uranium processing facilities in the US and Canada PURPOSE: Pooling of individual-level data for workers involved in uranium refining and processing (excluding enrichment) may provide valuable insights into risks from occupational uranium and external ionizing radiation exposures., METHODS: Data were pooled for workers from four uranium processing facilities (Fernald, Mallinckrodt and Middlesex from the U.S.; and Port Hope, Canada). Employment began as early as the 1930s and follow-up was as late as 2017. Workers were exposed to high concentrations of uranium, radium, and their decay products, as well as gamma radiation and ambient radon decay products. Exposure and outcome data were harmonized using similar definitions and dose reconstruction methods. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were estimated., RESULTS: In total, 560 deaths from lung cancer, 503 non-malignant respiratory diseases, 67 renal diseases, 1,596 ischemic heart diseases, and 101 dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) were detected in the pooled cohort of over 12,400 workers (~1,300 females). Mean cumulative doses were 45 millisievert for whole-body external ionizing radiation exposure and 172 milligray for lung dose from radon decay products. Only SMR for dementia and AD among males was statistically significant (SMR=1.29; 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.54)., CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study to date to examine long-term health risks of uranium processing workers.",Included,0.4554167
1161,"p53 expression in human rectal tissue after radiotherapy: upregulation in normal mucosa versus functional loss in rectal carcinomas PURPOSE: In vitro, ionizing radiation of epithelial cells leads to upregulation of wild-type p53 and subsequent induction of p21(waf1). The effect of radiotherapy (RT) on the expression of these proteins in patients is unknown. We assessed the influence of RT on the expression of p53 and p21(waf1) in normal mucosa and rectal carcinomas in vivo., METHODS: Tumor and normal tissue samples were derived from rectal cancer patients randomized in a clinical trial in which the value of preoperative RT was evaluated. p53 and p21(waf1) expression was determined in 51 irradiated and 52 nonirradiated patients using immunohistochemistry., RESULTS: In normal mucosa, both p53 and p21(waf1) were strongly upregulated after RT compared with the expression in unirradiated normal tissue (p <0.001). In tumor cells, no significant difference in the expression of p53 or p21(waf1) was found in the irradiated vs. nonirradiated group. In the few rectal tumors with wild-type p53, induction of p53 after RT did not necessarily lead to upregulation of p21(waf1)., CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that in normal mucosa, a functional p53-p21(waf1) pathway is present, whereas in tumor cells it is defective in almost all cases because of either p53 mutation or down- or upstream disruption in tumors with wild-type p53. Therefore, we believe that the role of p53 expression as a single prognostic marker in rectal cancer needs reconsideration.",Included,0.45542282
1136,"Radiation-induced malignancies after intensity-modulated versus conventional mediastinal radiotherapy in a small animal model A long-standing hypothesis in radiotherapy is that intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) increases the risk of second cancer due to low-dose exposure of large volumes of normal tissue. Therefore, young patients are still treated with conventional techniques rather than with modern IMRT. We challenged this hypothesis in first-of-its-kind experiments using an animal model. Cancer-prone Tp53+/C273X knockout rats received mediastinal irradiation with 3x5 or 3x8Gy using volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT, an advanced IMRT) or conventional anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior (AP/PA) beams using non-irradiated rats as controls (n=15/group, ntotal=90). Tumors were assigned to volumes receiving 90-107%, 50-90%, 5-50%, and <5% of the target dose and characterized by histology and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH). Irradiated rats predominantly developed lymphomas and sarcomas in areas receiving 50-107% (n=26) rather than 5-50% (n=7) of the target dose. Latency was significantly shortened only after 3x8Gy vs. controls (p<0.0001). The frequency (14/28 vs. 19/29; p=0.29) and latency (218 vs. 189 days; p=0.17) of radiation-associated tumors were similar after VMAT vs. AP/PA. LOH was strongly associated with sarcoma but not with treatment. The results do not support the hypothesis that IMRT increases the risk of second cancer. Thus the current practice of withholding dose-sparing IMRT from young patients may need to be re-evaluated.",Included,0.45542333
1139,"Head and neck radiotherapy does not increase gelatinase (metalloproteinase-2 and -9) expression or activity in teeth irradiated in vivo OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggested that head and neck radiotherapy increases active forms of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ), leading to enamel delamination and radiation-related caries. This study aimed to assess the expression and activity of the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex tissues of teeth irradiated in vivo., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-six teeth were studied, including 19 irradiated and 17 non-irradiated controls. In situ zymography was used to investigate the gelatinolytic activity in the micromorphologic components of enamel, DEJ, dentin-pulp complex, and caries. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on the demineralized samples to assess MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels in the DEJ, dentin-pulp complex components, and caries., RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were detected between groups in gelatinolytic activity or in MMP-2 expression levels (P > .05). Odontoblast MMP-9 expression was reduced in the irradiated group (P = .02)., CONCLUSIONS: The study rejected the hypothesis that MMP-2 and MMP-9 would be overexpressed or more activated in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex of irradiated teeth. Direct effects of radiation should not be regarded as an independent factor for explaining radiation-related caries onset and progression. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

931,"Gamma-radiation sensitivity and polymorphisms in RAD51L1 modulate glioma risk BACKGROUND: DNA strand breaks pose the greatest threat to genomic stability. Genetically determined mutagen sensitivity predisposes individuals to a variety of cancers, including glioma. However, polymorphisms in DNA strand break repair genes that may determine mutagen sensitivity are not well studied in cancer risk, especially in gliomas., METHODS: We correlated genotype data for tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of DNA strand break repair genes with a gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity phenotype [expressed as mean breaks per cell (B/C)] in samples from 426 glioma patients. We also conducted analysis to assess joint and haplotype effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on mutagen sensitivity. We further validate our results in an independent external control group totaling 662 subjects., RESULTS: Of the 392 tSNPs examined, we found that mutagen sensitivity was modified by one tSNP in the EME2 gene and six tSNPs in the RAD51L1 gene (P < 0.01). Among the six RAD51L1 SNPs tested in the validation set, one (RAD51L1 rs2180611) was significantly associated with mutagen sensitivity (P = 0.025). Moreover, we found a significant dose-response relationship between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse tSNP genotypes. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that RAD51L1 haplotypes F-A (zero adverse allele) and F-E (six adverse alleles) exhibited the lowest (0.42) and highest (0.93) mean B/C values, respectively. A similar dose-response relationship also existed between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse haplotypes., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that polymorphisms in and haplotypes of the RAD51L1 gene, which is involved in the double-strand break repair pathway, modulate gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity.",Included,0.4554468
904,"Reduction of Delayed Homologous Recombination by Induction of Radioadaptive Response in RaDR-GFP Mice (Yonezawa Effect): An Old Player With a New Role Radiotherapy (RT) treats cancer effectively with high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) to killing cancer cells and shrinking tumors while bearing the risk of developing different side effects, including secondary cancer, which is most concerning for long-term health consequences. Genomic instability (GI) is a characteristic of most cancer cells, and IR-induced GI can manifest as delayed homologous recombination (HR). Radioadaptive response (RAR) is capable of reducing genotoxicity, cell transformation, mutation, and carcinogenesis, but the rational evidence describing its contributions to the reduction of radiation risk, in particular, carcinogenesis, remains fragmented. In this work, to investigate the impact of RAR on high-dose, IR-induced GI measured as delayed HR, the frequency of recombinant cells was comparatively studied under RAR-inducible and -uninducible conditions in the nucleated cells in hematopoietic tissues (bone marrow and spleen) using the Rosa26 Direct Repeat-green fluorescent protein (RaDR-GFP) homozygote mice. Results demonstrated that the frequency of recombinant cells was significantly lower in hematopoietic tissues under RAR-inducible condition. These findings suggest that reduction in delayed HR may be at least a part of the mechanisms underlying decreased carcinogenesis by RAR, and application of RAR would contribute to a more rigorous and scientifically grounded system of radiation protection in RT.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Included,0.45544696

Since there are many uncertainties in research of doses below 100 mSv, this study attempted to evaluate DNA damage levels in chronically exposed personnel. The study group consisted of 24 subjects matched with a control population by the number of participants, age, gender ratio, active smoking status, the period of blood sampling, and residence. Based on regular dosimetry using thermoluminiscent dosimeters, our study group occupationally received a dose of 1.82 +/- 3.60 mSv over the last year. The results of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay and the comet assay showed a higher nuclear buds frequency (4.09 +/- 1.88) and tail length (15.46 +/- 1.47 mum) than in the control group (2.96 +/- 1.67, 14.05 +/- 1.36 mum, respectively). Differences in other descriptors from both tests did not reach statistical significance. Further investigations are needed to develop algorithms for improving personal dosimetry and those that would engage larger biomonitoring study groups. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A mouse model of gamma-ray induced leukemia was produced, and by means of quantitative real-time PCR, immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), the expression of mRNA and protein, phosphorylation level, and protein activity of ERK1/2, STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells were investigated in these mice. The results indicated that mRNA and protein expressions of ERK1/2 were upregulated, with significant increase of phosphorylation level and protein activity, but with insignificant differences in mRNA and protein expressions, phosphorylation level and protein activity of STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice compared to the radiation/tumor-free or control mice. It is concluded that in the pathogenesis of gamma-ray induced leukemia in Balb/C mice, activated ERK1/2 pathway may play a role, without involving STAT3 pathway; meanwhile, SHP-2 exerts no regulative effect on pathways of Ras-ERK1/2 and JAK-STAT.",Included,0.45545766

In rectal tumor patients, particularly at stage IV, the level of PHA-induced BRL and the total number of rosette-forming cells (RFC) were lower than in healthy donors. Surgery did not produce any significant changes in cell-mediated immunity parameters: level of PHA-induced BRL decreased by 16,7%, while total RFC number increased by 17.2% in (mostly low-affinity forms). Preoperative radiation resulted in a significant decrease in lymphocyte ability to undergo PHA-induced blast-transformation (45%) and spontaneous rosette formation, high-affinity lymphocytes being most sensitive to ionizing radiation.

The present study was undertaken to establish whether in vitro gamma-radiation effects in chacma baboon and human lymphocytes are comparable. The sensitive and rapid nucleoid sedimentation technique was employed to evaluate in vitro DNA superstructure, damage and repair in readily obtainable radiosensitive peripheral lymphocytes. Dose-response curves after 60Co gamma-irradiation were obtained, and by applying single-hit kinetics of the target theory, an estimation of molecular masses of the supercoiled domains was made. The baboon and human lymphocytes produced analogous results, while an ethidium bromide intercalation study also revealed a similarity in average DNA superhelical density. Lymphocyte DNA repair after 0.5-4.0 Gy gamma-irradiation and repair times from 0.5 to 5.0 h were evaluated. The repair data obtained from baboon and human cells after 2.0 Gy irradiation compared favourably in extent of DNA repair as well as the profiles of the kinetic curves. These findings indicate that the chacma baboon would be a useful and relevant model for further in vivo radiobiological studies on lymphocytes. The effects of sedimentation conditions and advantages of using vertical-tube rotors in the nucleoid sedimentation technique are also discussed.",Included,0.45546013

Mutations were analyzed by comparing genotypes of malignant tumors and matched normal tissues of 255 cancer patients including 98 exposed to external gamma-radiation (mean dose 128.1+/-150.5mSv). Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2+/-204.6mSv and 150.5+/-211.2mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133, rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) . Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs. This suggests different mechanisms of inactivation of heterozygous genotypes in sporadic and radiation-induced tumors. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Included,0.45546743

Genotoxic stress in humans can be monitored by quantifying the amount of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in immune cells from a simple finger prick. In a cohort of 674 healthy donors, we show that the endogenous level of DSBs increases with age and with latent cytomegalovirus infection. To map the range of human responses to space radiation, we then study DSB induction and repair in immune cells from 319 healthy donors after the cells are exposed to galactic cosmic ray components and lymphocytes from 30 cancer patients after radiotherapy. Individuals with low baseline DSB have fewer clinical complications, enhanced DNA damage repair responses, and a functional dose-dependent cytokine response in healthy donor cells. This supports the use of DSB monitoring for health resilience in space., Pariset et al. find that individuals with a lower baseline level of DNA damage are resilient to clinical complications after radiotherapy and present higher radiation-induced levels of DNA repair foci and inflammatory cytokines. These findings support the use of baseline DNA damage as a biomarker for radiation sensitivity.Copyright © 2020",Included,0.4554696

Three different fractionation schedules were subjected to investigation by both of these methods to try to elucidate some features of irradiation damage to the whole of the intestinal mucosa, at dose levels commonly used in clinical practice. Despite variations in the qualitative observations, there was a marked difference in two of the schedules between damage expressed as crypt counts and that described by the qualitative techniques. In the first case high crypt numbers were associated with severe mucosal damage, whereas the second schedule produced a reduced crypt count in association with low damage to the surface mucosa. A third schedule produced results in which there was a general agreement between low crypt numbers and considerable surface mucosal damage. However, observations were made of mucosal formations not previously seen on damaged mucosal surfaces. These resembled the appearance normally associated with the gut of patients suffering from coeliac disease. Variations in the qualitative observations were seen in all the schedules so that their interpretation in terms of perturbation of cellular kinetics is difficult.",Included,0.45547846

For solid cancer mortality there is no indication of curvilinearity in the dose response: no statistically significant improvement in fit to a linear relative risk model is provided by addition of quadratic or threshold dose terms. If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to solid cancer mortality data, the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.13). If a linear-quadratic-threshold model is used the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI < 0.00-0.15). For leukaemia mortality there is highly statistically significant upward curvature in the dose response. In particular, if a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to the leukaemia data, the best estimate of the threshold is 0.16 Sv (95% CI 0.05-0.40) (two-sided p=0.001 for test of departure of threshold from 0). However, there is no evidence for a threshold effect (two-sided p = 0.16) when a quadratic term is included in the dose response: the best estimate of threshold in this case is 0.09Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.29). Moreover, addition of a quadratic term improves the fit of a linear-threshold model at borderline levels of statistical significance (two-sided p = 0.07). Therefore, the most parsimonious description of the leukaemia dose response is provided by a linear-quadratic function of dose., CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of threshold-type departures from the linear-quadratic dose response either for solid tumours or for leukaemia in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor mortality data.",Included,0.4554848

620,"Cohort study of occupational cosmic radiation dose and cancer mortality in German aircrew, 1960-2014 Objectives To determine cancer mortality compared with the general population and to examine dose-response relationships between cumulative occupational radiation dose and specific cancer outcomes in the German aircrew cohort. Methods For a cohort of 26 846 aircrew personnel, standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated. Dose-response analyses were carried out using Poisson regression to assess dose-related cancer risks for the period 1960-2014. Exposure assessment comprises recently available dose register data for all cohort members and newly estimated retrospective cabin crew doses for 1960-2003. Results SMR for all-cause, specific cancer groups and most individual cancers were reduced in all aircrew groups. The only increases were seen for brain cancer in pilots (n=23, SMR 2.01, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.28) and for malignant melanoma (n=10, SMR 1.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.85). Breast cancer mortality among female cabin crew was similar to the general population (n=71, SMR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.44). Overall median cumulative effective dose was 34.2 mSv (max: 116 mSv) for 1960-2014. No dose-response associations were seen in any of the models. For brain cancer, relative risks were elevated across dose categories. An indicative negative trend with increasing dose category was seen for large intestine cancer in female cabin crew (n=23). Conclusions There was no evidence for significant dose-response patterns for the considered cancer types. Interpretation of results remains difficult as cumulative dose is closely related to age. Future work should focus on investigating radiation jointly with other risk factors that may contribute to risks for specific cancers among aircrew.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

162,"Effect of X-irradiation on epidermal immune function: decreased density and alloantigen-presenting capacity of Ia+ Langerhans cells and impaired production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF) The mechanisms involved in the modulation of cutaneous immune responses by UV radiation have been extensively investigated; by contrast, few studies have addressed the effects of x-irradiation on epidermal immune function. We therefore investigated the effect of x-irradiation of mice on: (a) the density of epidermal Ia+ Langerhans cells (LC) in immunofluorescence studies, (b) epidermal cell (EC) allostimulatory capacity in the allogeneic EC-lymphocyte reaction (ELR), and (c) production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF). C3H/He and BALB/c mice were irradiated with 900, 1,800, 2,700, or 3,600 rad from a 137Cs source, and sacrificed 10 h or 3 days later. X-irradiation of mice 10 h previously only slightly decreased the density of epidermal Ia+ LC and did not affect the capacity of their EC to stimulate allogeneic responder lymphocytes in the ELR. X-irradiation of mice 3 days previously, however, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the density of Ia+ LC. This decrease was accompanied by a substantial reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity in the ELR at all doses of x-irradiation. ETAF production by cultured EC from mice x-irradiated 3 days previously was also found to be diminished at all doses of x-irradiation. Trypan blue exclusion studies demonstrated that the observed decreases in EC allostimulatory capacity and ETAF production were not the result of a generalized lethal effect of x-irradiation on EC. The reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity following in vivo x-irradiation could not be reversed by addition of exogenous ETAF or interleukin-1 in the ELR. Taken together, these results indicate that x-irradiation decreases the density of Ia+ LC, impairs LC alloantigen-presenting function, and reduces ETAF production. Thus cutaneous x-irradiation may affect inflammatory and neoplastic processes not only by its antimitotic activity, but also by a direct effect on EC which subserve immunologic functions.",Included,0.45548776

137,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

976,"Segmental Differences in Radiation-Induced Alterations of Tight Junction-Related Proteins in Non-Human Primate Jejunum, Ileum and Colon Dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier and leakage of luminal antigens and bacteria across the barrier have been linked to various human diseases. Intestinal permeability is regulated by intercellular structures, termed ""tight junction"" (Tj), which are disrupted after total-body irradiation (TBI). In this study, we investigated radiation-induced alterations in Tj-related proteins in the jejunum, ileum and colon of a non-human primate (NHP) model. NHPs were total-body irradiated with 6.7 and 7.4 Gy and intestines were procured at day 4, 7 and 12. Radiation exposure was found to induce significant increases in claudin-10 mRNA early (day 4) in all three gut segments and claudin-4 mRNA levels were repressed through day 12. TNF-alpha was highly induced in the jejunum and colon at early time points, but little induction was found in the ileum. Claudin-1 was induced only in the colon on day 4 postirradiation. Unlike the colon and jejunum, the ileum levels of claudin-7 were significantly downregulated through day 12 postirradiation. Western blot analysis revealed increased levels of claudin-2 on day 4 and of JAM-1 on day 7 postirradiation in all three gut segments. E-cadherin was downregulated on day 4 postirradiation in all segments, but remained reduced in the jejunum only until day 12. Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to radiation causes segment-specific alterations in the expression of Tj-related proteins. Interruption of Tjs may be a key factor contributing to injury to the intestinal mucosal barrier and increased intestinal permeability.",Included,0.45549238
578,"Influence of dose rate on survival time for 239PuO2-induced radiation pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis in dogs Beagle dogs were exposed once or repeatedly to 0.75-microns-diameter monodisperse aerosols of 239PuO2 by pernasal inhalation. The dogs that were exposed once received alveolar depositions (+/- standard deviation) of 3.9 +/- 1.9 kBq/kg body mass and accumulated doses of 23 +/- 8 Gy to the lung before death at 5.4 +/- 1.7 years after exposure. Dogs exposed repeatedly received a total alveolar deposition of 5.3 +/- 0.9 kBq/kg body mass during 7 to 10 semiannual exposures and accumulated doses of 22 +/- 5 Gy to the lung before death at 4.9 +/- 0.7 years after first exposure. Clearance of the plutonium from the lung in the dogs exposed repeatedly was slower than in the dogs exposed once. All dogs in the repeated-exposure study and all but one dog in the single-exposure study died from radiation effects. Pulmonary fibrosis accounted for 72% of the radiation-related deaths in the single-exposure study and 87% in the repeated-exposure study. The remaining dogs died with pulmonary cancer. Based on total cumulative radiation dose, the times after exposure to death from radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis were not significantly different for single and repeated exposures. Thus dose rate does not appear to be an important factor in predicting death from radiation pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis for dogs inhaling 239PuO2.",Included,0.45549315
135,"Gamma-radiation sensitivity and risk of glioma BACKGROUND: About 9% of human cancers are brain tumors, of which 90% are gliomas. gamma-Radiation has been identified as a risk factor for brain tumors. In a previous pilot study, we found that lymphocytes from patients with glioma were more sensitive to gamma-radiation than were lymphocytes from matched control subjects. In this larger case-control study, we compared the gamma-radiation sensitivity of lymphocytes from glioma patients with those from control subjects and investigated the association between mutagen sensitivity and the risk for developing glioma., METHODS: We used a mutagen sensitivity assay (an indirect measure of DNA repair activity) to assess chromosomal damage. We gamma-irradiated (1.5 Gy) short-term lymphocyte cultures from 219 case patients with glioma and from 238 healthy control subjects frequency matched by age and sex. After irradiation, cells were cultured for 4 hours, and then Colcemid was added for 1 hour to arrest cells in mitosis. Fifty metaphases were randomly selected for each sample and scored for chromatid breaks. All statistical tests were two-sided., RESULTS: We observed a statistically significantly higher frequency of chromatid breaks per cell from case patients with glioma (mean = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50 to 0.59) than from control subjects (mean = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.41 to 0.48) (P<.001). Using 0.40 (the median number of chromatid breaks per cell in control subjects) as the cut point for defining mutagen sensitivity and adjusting for age, sex, and smoking status, we found that mutagen sensitivity was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk for glioma (odds ratio = 2.09; 95% CI = 1.43 to 3.06). When the data were divided into tertiles, the relative risk for glioma increased from the lowest tertile to the highest tertile (trend test, P<.001)., CONCLUSION: gamma-Radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity of lymphocytes may be associated with an increased risk for glioma, a result that supports our earlier preliminary findings.",Included,0.45549357
705,"Changes of hexose monophosphate pathway and methemoglobin reductase enzyme activity after radiation in guinea pigs HMP pathway activity changes occurring after exposure to ionizing radiation (LD50 dose) have been investigated. The study was carried out on 18 experimental guinea pigs subjected to 5 successive exposures of 150 rads 3 or 4 days apart. The control animals were sham radiated but were otherwise treated identically as those of the experimental groups. Blood samples were taken by cardiac puncture before radiation and 30 min after each exposure of 150 rads. The red cells were re-suspended in their own plasma and HMP pathway activity was measured in the suspension. The pathway activity showed a consistent but minor reduction in the experimental group, which became statistically significant after the total dose of 750 rads (P less than 0.020). In a separate study the changes induced by ionizing radiation in the erythrocyte enzyme NADH-methemoglobin reductase were measured using the same experimental protocol. The enzyme activity in the red cells of the experimental group varied between 34.90 +/- 2.17 to 161.95 +/- 5.34 I.U./ml erythrocyte pack.

Dose-effect curves for the quantal responses of moist desquamation (early epithelial response) and dermal necrosis (late response) were fitted by probit analysis and ED50 values obtained. For a neutron fractionation scheme comprised of 12 fractions in 26 days, and using an unfiltered beam, the ED50 values for moist desquamation and dermal necrosis were 18.67 +/- 2.22 and 22.25 +/- 0.48 Gy, respectively, whereas in the case of the filtered beam, the corresponding ED50 values were 24.78 +/- 1.44 and 23.30 +/- 0.47 Gy. In order to provide a comparison, the values for 24 fractions of 60Co gamma-rays given in 39 days (a clinical protocol used in the Groote Schuur Hospital) were 74.02 +/- 2.92 and 66.72 +/- 1.93 Gy for moist desquamation and dermal necrosis, respectively. For the unfiltered beam, values for the comparative biological effectiveness (CBE) were 3.96 and 3.00 for the early and late skin response, respectively. The corresponding CBE values were for the filtered beam 2.99 and 2.86.

838,"The lack of cytotoxic effect and radioadaptive response in splenocytes of mice exposed to low level internal beta-particle irradiation through tritiated drinking water in vivo Health effects of tritium, a beta-emitter and a by-product of the nuclear industry, is a subject of significant controversy. This mouse in vivo study was undertaken to monitor biological effects of low level tritium exposure. Mice were exposed to tritiated drinking water (HTO) at 10 KBq/L, 1 MBq/L and 20 MBq/L concentrations for one month. The treatment did not result in a significant increase of apoptosis in splenocytes. To examine if this low level tritium exposure alters radiosensitivity, the extracted splenocytes were challenged in vitro with 2 Gy gamma-radiation, and apoptotic responses at 1 and 24 h were measured. No alterations in the radiosensitivity were detected in cells from mice exposed to tritium compared to sham-treated mice. In contrast, low dose gamma-irradiation at 20 or 100 mGy, resulted in a significant increase in resistance to apoptotic cell death after 2 Gy irradiation; an indication of the radioadaptive response. Overall, our data suggest that low concentrations of tritium given to mice as HTO in drinking water do not exert cytotoxic effect in splenocytes, nor do they change cellular sensitivity to additional high dose gamma-radiation. The latter may be considered as the lack of a radioadaptive response, typically observed after low dose gamma-irradiation. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Included,0.4554992
208,"The morphologic effects of radiation administered therapeutically for intracranial gliomas: a postmortem study of 25 cases To investigate the pathologic consequences of therapeutic radiation, this morphologic study evaluated the brains of 25 patients with intracranial gliomas treated both with and without this form of therapy. Although beneficial effects such as the retardation of tumor growth were evident in these studies, among the seventeen patients who received from 5000--6000 rads for malignant gliomas, four developed ""late delayed"" radiation necrosis. The strong predilection of this tissue response for the white matter adjacent to the neoplasm suggests a local sensitivity which may have been engendered or enhanced by cerebral edema. A fifth case disclosed focal demyelination in the mid-brain suggesting ""early delayed"" radiation necrosis, and an additional case had distinctive foci of necrosis within the brain stem. Changes of diffuse cerebral edema were noted in many of the radiated brains.

Experimental animals were exposed to radiation generated by a linear accelerator at the chest and killed after 3 months. Heart tissues from these animals were removed for Masson staining, PPAR-gamma immunohistochemical staining, Western blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). In addition, the protein expression of matrix metalloprotein-1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and transforming growth factor type beta1 (TGF-beta1), all of which are associated with fibrosis, was measured. Masson staining revealed significant myocardial fibrosis, degeneration and necrosis in rats exposed to radiation. The results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis showed that PPAR-gamma protein expression in hearts of the irradiation groups was significantly higher than in the control group, especially in myocardium and vascular endothelial (p < 0.05). RT-PCR results also showed a parallel increase in PPAR-gamma mRNA expression in the heart of the irradiation groups compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The expression of MMP-1 protein was not significantly different in three groups (p > 0.05). The expression of TIMP-1 and TGF-beta1 proteins was, however, higher in two irradiation groups than in the control group (p < 0.05).

77,"Sex and tissue-specific differences in low-dose radiation-induced oncogenic signaling PURPOSE: The possible adverse health effects of low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure constitute a growing concern. Clinically and environmentally relevant exposures occur predominantly under chronic conditions, notwithstanding that most studies of LDR effects have been performed using a single acute exposure. Sex- and tissue-specificity of the LDR-induced changes have not been considered before. We investigated LDR-related expression patterns in muscle, liver and spleen of male and female mice subjected to acute and chronic LDR exposure. Genes involved in oncogenic signaling were of specific interest, as radiation is a well-known carcinogen., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of genes coding for growth factors and growth-factor receptors, cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinases, G-proteins and nuclear DNA-binding proteins, and other important components of oncogenic signaling., RESULTS: We found sex- and tissue-specific changes in the expression of Ras superfamily members (Nras, Rab2, Rab34, Vav2), protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (PKCbeta, PKCmu), AP-1 factor components (Jun, JunB and FosB), Wnt signaling pathway members as well as in a variety of other cellular proto-oncogenes and oncogenes. Importantly, Western blot analysis of JunB, PKCmu and Rab2 proteins supported the transcriptomic data., CONCLUSIONS: Substantially different protein levels were observed in all three tissues (muscle, spleen and liver) of acutely and chronically irradiated female and male animals. Based on the obtained data and available literature, we discuss several possible mechanisms that may contribute to radiation-induced carcinogenesis in various tissues of males and females.

In addition, analyses treating the estimated plutonium body burden as a continuous variable indicate increasing risk with increasing burden (P < 0.001). Relative risks tended to be higher for females than for males, probably because of the lower baseline risk and the higher levels of plutonium measured in females.

Analyses of causes of death related or unrelated to smoking indicate that, although confounding by smoking may be present, it is unlikely to explain all of this increased risk. The excess relative risk for leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was 1.93 per Sv (< 0 to 8.47). On the basis of these estimates, 1-2% of deaths from cancer among workers in this cohort may be attributable to radiation., CONCLUSIONS: These estimates, from the largest study of nuclear workers ever conducted, are higher than, but statistically compatible with, the risk estimates used for current radiation protection standards.

Medical and dosimetry information on the clean-up workers, males, who got radiation doses from April 26, 1986 to April 26, 1987, which was accumulated from 1992 to 2012, was used for the analysis. The total size of the cohort was 42929 people, 12731 deaths were registered in the cohort, among them 1893 deaths from solid cancers and 5230 deaths were from circulation diseases. An average age of the workers was 39 years in 1992 and the mean dose was 164 mGy. The dose-effect relationship was estimated with the use of non-parametric analysis of survival with regard to concurrence of risks of mortality.

Calculation of SRR was carried out for the following intervals of the total dose of external exposure: 0; >0-0.05; >0.05-0.10; >0.10-0.15; >0.15-0.20; >0.20-0.30; >0.30-0.50; >0.5-1.0; >= 1.0 G y. The control group consisted of occupationally non-exposed employees of the SC. The calculation of SRR and ERR was performed using the Poisson regression using the AM FIT module of the EPICU RE package. Results. The incidence of MNLT among males of SC was 17.1 per 100,000 P YO, with the highest incidence rates for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CL) and chronic leukemia (CL) excluding CL. Among females of the SC, the incidence of MNLT was 21.3 per 100,000 PYO. It was found that in none of the intervals of the external exposure there was no statistically significant excess of the SRR compared with the control group. The results of ERR/Gy calculation also did not demonstrate the increased risk of hemoblastosis among people occupationally exposed to IR. Conclusion. Occupational exposure in the studied dose range does not increase the risk of developing MNLT.Copyright © 2020, Tomsk National Research Medical Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

757,"Risk of cancer associated with low-dose radiation exposure: comparison of results between the INWORKS nuclear workers study and the A-bomb survivors study The Life Span Study (LSS) of Japanese atomic bomb survivors has served as the primary basis for estimates of radiation-related disease risks that inform radiation protection standards. The long-term follow-up of radiation-monitored nuclear workers provides estimates of radiation-cancer associations that complement findings from the LSS. Here, a comparison of radiation-cancer mortality risk estimates derived from the LSS and INWORKS, a large international nuclear worker study, is presented. Restrictions were made, so that the two study populations were similar with respect to ages and periods of exposure, leading to selection of 45,625 A-bomb survivors and 259,350 nuclear workers. For solid cancer, excess relative rates (ERR) per gray (Gy) were 0.28 (90% CI 0.18; 0.38) in the LSS, and 0.29 (90% CI 0.07; 0.53) in INWORKS. A joint analysis of the data allowed for a formal assessment of heterogeneity of the ERR per Gy across the two studies (P=0.909), with minimal evidence of curvature or of a modifying effect of attained age, age at exposure, or sex in either study. There was evidence in both cohorts of modification of the excess absolute risk (EAR) of solid cancer by attained age, with a trend of increasing EAR per Gy with attained age. For leukemia, under a simple linear model, the ERR per Gy was 2.75 (90% CI 1.73; 4.21) in the LSS and 3.15 (90% CI 1.12; 5.72) in INWORKS, with evidence of curvature in the association across the range of dose observed in the LSS but not in INWORKS; the EAR per Gy was 3.54 (90% CI 2.30; 5.05) in the LSS and 2.03 (90% CI 0.36; 4.07) in INWORKS. These findings from different study populations may help understanding of radiation risks, with INWORKS contributing information derived from cohorts of workers with protracted low dose-rate exposures.",Included,0.45551017
924,"The effects of radiation and dose-fractionation on cancer and non-tumor disease development The Janus series of radiation experiments, conducted from 1970 to 1992, explored the effects of gamma and neutron radiation on animal lifespan and disease development. Data from these experiments presents an opportunity to conduct a large scale analysis of both tumor and non-tumor disease development. This work was focused on a subset of animals from the Janus series of experiments, comparing acute or fractionated exposures of gamma or neutron radiation on the hazards associated with the development of tumor and non-tumor diseases of the liver, lung, kidney or vascular system. This study also examines how the co-occurrence of non-tumor diseases may affect tumor-associated hazards. While exposure to radiation increases the hazard of dying with tumor and non-tumor diseases, dose fractionation modulates these hazards, which varies across different organ systems. Finally, the effect that concurrent non-cancer diseases have on the hazard of dying with a tumor also differs by organ system. These results highlight the complexity in the effects of radiation on the liver, lung, kidney and vascular system.",Included,0.4555145
253,"CNS cancers and radiation exposure: a case-control study among workers at two nuclear facilities A nested case-control study was conducted among workers employed in two nuclear facilities to investigate the possible association of primary CNS cancers with occupational exposure to radiation from external and internal sources. External radiation monitoring data from film badges were available for 27 cases and 90 matched controls. The radiation dose to the lung from internally deposited uranium was estimated for 47 cases and 120 matched controls from area and personnel monitoring data and was used in analyses in lieu of the brain dose. No association was observed between deaths from CNS cancers and exposure to ionizing radiation from external or internal sources. However, due to the small number of monitored subjects and low doses, a modest association could not be ruled out.",Included,0.45551533
1013,"Long term effects of radiation exposure on telomere lengths of leukocytes and its associated biomarkers among atomic-bomb survivors Ionizing radiation (IR) is a major source of cellular damage and the immediate cellular response to IR has been well characterized. But the long-term impact of IR on cell function and its relationship with aging are not known. Here, we examined the IR effects on telomere length and other biomarkers 50 to 68 years post-exposure (two time points per person) in survivors of the atomic bombing at Hiroshima during WWII. We found that telomere length of leukocytes was inversely correlated with the dose of IR (p=0.008), and this effect was primarily found in survivors who were exposed at younger ages; specifically those <12 years old (p=0.0004). Although a dose-related retardation of telomere shortening with age was observed in the cross-sectional data, longitudinal follow-up after 11 years did not show IR exposure-related alteration of the rate of telomere shortening with age. In addition, IR diminished the associations between telomere length and selected aging biomarkers that were observed in survivors with no dose. These included uric acid metabolism, cytokines, and blood T cell counts. These findings showed long-lasting detrimental effects of IR on telomere length of leukocytes in both dose- and age-at-exposure dependent manner, and on alterations of biomarkers with aging.",Included,0.45551577
893,"Inflammatory disease and C-reactive protein in relation to therapeutic ionising radiation exposure in the US Radiologic Technologists Chronic inflammation underlies many autoimmune diseases, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and rheumatoid arthritis, also type-2 diabetes and osteoarthritis. Associations have been suggested of high-dose ionising radiation exposure with type-2 diabetes and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of chronic inflammation. In this analysis we used a proportional hazards model to assess effects of radiotherapy on risks of subsequent inflammatory disease morbidity in 110,368 US radiologic technologists followed from a baseline survey (1983-1989/1994-1998) through 2008. We used a linear model to assess log-transformed C-reactive protein concentration following radiotherapy in 1326 technologists. Relative risk of diabetes increased following radiotherapy (p < 0.001), and there was a borderline significant increasing trend per treatment (p = 0.092). For osteoarthritis there was increased relative risk associated with prior radiotherapy on all questionnaires (p = 0.005), and a significant increasing trend per previous treatment (p = 0.024). No consistent increases were observed for other types of inflammatory disease (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis) associated with radiotherapy. There was a borderline significant (p = 0.059) increasing trend with dose for C-reactive protein with numbers of prior radiotherapy treatments. Our results suggest that radiotherapy is associated with subsequent increased risk of certain inflammatory conditions, which is reinforced by our finding of elevated levels of C-reactive protein.",Included,0.4555174
1066,"Lung cancer mortality associated with protracted low-dose occupational radiation exposures and smoking behaviors in U.S. radiologic technologists, 1983-2012 In the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, risk of lung cancer has been shown to increase with greater acute exposure to ionizing radiation. Although similar findings have been observed in populations exposed to low-dose, protracted radiation, such studies lack information on cigarette smoking history, a potential confounder. In a cohort of 106 068 U.S. radiologic technologists, we examined the association between estimated cumulative lung absorbed dose from occupational radiation exposure and lung cancer mortality. Poisson regression models, adjusted for attained age, sex, birth cohort, pack-years smoked and years since quitting smoking, were used to calculate linear excess relative risks (ERR) per 100 mGy, using time-dependent cumulative lung absorbed dose, lagged 10 years. Mean cumulative absorbed dose to the lung was 25 mGy (range: 0-810 mGy). During the 1983 to 2012 follow-up, 1090 participants died from lung cancer. Greater occupational radiation lung dose was not associated with lung cancer mortality overall (ERR per 100 mGy: -0.02, 95% CI: <0-0.13). However, significant dose-response relationships were observed for some subgroups, which might be false-positive results given the number of statistical tests performed. As observed in other studies of radiation and smoking, the interaction between radiation and smoking appeared to be sub-multiplicative with an ERR per 100 mGy of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.01-1.15) for those who smoked <20 pack-years and -0.03 (95% CI: <0-0.15) for those who smoked >=20 pack-years. Our study provides some evidence that greater protracted radiation exposure in the low-dose range is positively associated with lung cancer mortality.Copyright © 2020 UICC",Included,0.4555178
267,"Correlation between radiation dose and p53 protein expression levels in human lymphocytes The aim of this research was to evaluate the relationship between p53 protein levels and absorbed doses from in vitro irradiated human lymphocytes. For this, samples of blood from 23 donors were irradiated with 0.5; 1; 2; and 4 Gy from a Cobalt-60 source, and the percentages of lymphocytes expressing p53 were scored using Flow Cytometry. The subjects were divided into 3 groups, in accordance with the p53 levels expressed per radiation dose: low (Group I), high (Group II), and excessive levels (Group III). For all groups, the analyses showed that the p53 expression levels increase with the absorbed dose. Particularly for groups I and II, the correlation between this protein expression and the dose follows the linear-quadratic model, such as for radioinduced chromosomal aberrations. In conclusion, our findings indicate possible applications of this approach in evaluating individual radiosensitivity prior to radiotherapeutical procedures as well as in medical surveillance of occupationally exposed workers. Furthermore, due to the rapidity of flow-cytometric analyses, the methodology here employed would play an important role in emergency responses to a large-scale radiation incident where many people may have been exposed.",Included,0.45551917
539,"Apollo Lunar Astronauts Show Higher Cardiovascular Disease Mortality: Possible Deep Space Radiation Effects on the Vascular Endothelium As multiple spacefaring nations contemplate extended manned missions to Mars and the Moon, health risks could be elevated as travel goes beyond the Earth's protective magnetosphere into the more intense deep space radiation environment. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth's magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4-5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts exposed to deep space radiation.",Included,0.4555214
