112,"Apoptosis of Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes in the Members of the Techa River Cohort Chronically Exposed to Radiation The purpose of the present research was to estimate the intensity of the apoptotic death of lymphocytes during the period of carcinogenic effect realization in the residents of the Techa riverside villages. The investigation included analyses of the frequency of lymphocytes at the early and late stages of apoptosis and necrosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes using the method of FITC Annexin V, lymphocyte counts at the stage of DNA fragmentation using the TUNEL method, and the number of CD95(+)-lymphocytes. In the capacity of additional tests, loading tests involving in vitro irradiation at the dose of 1 Gy of a suspension of lymphocytes and incubations for 5 and 24 hours were used. Activation of the initial apoptotic and necrotic death of peripheral blood lymphocytes was revealed in the persons chronically exposed to low-intensity radiation within the range from 0.01 to 4.23 Gy. Exposed patients demonstrated a decrease in the number of CD95(+)-cells as compared to unexposed patients. The results of the cell death studies in the persons residing in the Techa riverside villages testify indirectly to the genomic instability of the peripheral blood lymphocytes.",Excluded,0.9676413

804,"Unstable chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei analyses in the biomonitoring of workers occupationally exposed to ionising radiation The quantification of unstable chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei in peripheral blood lymphocytes is a method commonly used in biodosimetry by cytogenetic analysis, especially when physical dosimetry cannot be performed. In this context, the aim of this research was to compare these methods in the biomonitoring of health professionals occupationally exposed to ionising radiation. In parallel, the C-banding technique was applied to confirm the presence of unstable chromosomal aberrations (dicentrics and rings). For this, samples of peripheral blood from health professionals of three hospitals (Recife - Brazil) were collected and lymphocyte cultures were carried out based on classical cytogenetic techniques. The number of cells scored per subject was the same (1000) for each assay. Among the individuals, those who do not usually wear a lead apron had higher frequencies of unstable chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei than the ones who carefully observe the radioprotection rules.

The three cyst populations experimented could be differentiated according to their development and survival rates. The variations observed for both of these criteria were related to the age of the cysts and the selection technique. The study of radiosensitivity based on LD50 value showed that the highest radiosensitivity differences were related to the cyst selection technique and not to the age. Furthermore, the three cyst populations showed that radio-induced lethal effects were enhanced, or appeared with time, namely following the delay between irradiation and the cyst development study. The observation of late effects after irradiations or after space flights show the difficulties encountered in assessing radiative risks during long duration space flights.",Excluded,0.9667634

59,"[Assessment of the genetic risk of radiation by irradiation data from laboratory mammals] An attempt has been made to assess quantitatively genetic risk of radiation for man based on mammalian (mostly mouse) data and using the direct method proposed by UNSCEAR. The parameter employed was induction of reciprocal translocations. Two assumptions were made: human radiosensitivity equals that of the mouse; and dose-response is linear. From observations with acute gamma irradiation the estimate of risk per 10(-2) Gy was as follows: 39 translocation heterozygotes are expected among one million F1 conceptions, 5 cases of multiple congenital anomalies, 25 abortions recorded and 49 unrecorded. Chronic gamma irradiation at dose rates of 1.3 X 10(-5), 1.7 X 10(-4) and 1.0 X 10(-4) Gy/min was 3 to 10 times less effective. Exposure to 4.2 GeV deuterons proved inferior in effectiveness to gamma irradiation. Chronic exposure to 4.1 MeV neutrons delivered at 8 X 10(-4) Gy/min showed 7 times the effectiveness of chronic gamma irradiation. Administration of tritiated water (from 37 to 37 X 10(2) kBq/g b.w.) to rats entailed a risk of the same order of magnitude as external chronic gamma irradiation. Reduction of genetic risk was achieved by pretreatment with either AFT-, ATP-serotonin mixtures or the molecular combinations, Adeturon and Cytriphos. Study of interspecies differences in genetic radiosensitivity showed decline in the following order: rat-rabbit-mouse-Syrian hamster. A dose-rate effect was most clearly seen in the rat, and least clearly in the rabbit. In female mice, examination of oocyte depletion indicated primary follicles to be highly susceptible to acute gamma irradiation; decrease in sensitivity was observed beginning with stage 4. Chronic gamma irradiation was found to be less effective.",Excluded,0.9666076

481,"[Possibilities of prognostication of individual radiation sensitivity] Proceeding from the concept of individual radiosensitivity as a sign of total reactivity 3 directions in a study of its possible prediction were considered: establishing correlation between separate indices characterizing the initial state and total radiosensitivity; correlation between body reactions to non-radiation exposures and subsequent irradiation; comparison of total radiosensitivity to irradiation at a small dose and subsequent irradiation at LD50. The following indices were used for the evaluation of the basal status of the body: oxygen consumption level, body mass increase rate, the level of water and basal metabolism, peripheral blood indices, body temperature, basal indices of the functional adrenocortical activity, the state of the cardiovascular system. The following non-radiation stress-exposures were used: physical exercise, constant magnetic field, starvation, hypoxia, and adrenaline administration. A V-type dependency was established for most investigated indices of the basal status and reaction of the body to non-radiation exposures. The utmost radioresistance was shown by animals in whom the basal indices or their reaction to non-radiation exposure approximated the average group level. The third direction: comparison of radiosensitivity and radiation damage--was analyzed by comparing the reaction of cerebral biocurrents to radiation exposure at a small dose with subsequent damage of the body following irradiation at a lethal dose. The accuracy of predicting the outcome of radiation injury by some of the indices varied from 65 to 80%. In some indices of the basal status and reactivity evaluation it reached 85-90%.",Excluded,0.9662474

523,"Molecular and cellular profiling of acute responses to total body radiation exposure in ovariectomized female cynomolgus macaques Purpose: The threat of radiation exposure requires a mechanistic understanding of radiation-induced immune injury and recovery. The study objective was to evaluate responses to ionizing radiation in ovariectomized (surgically post-menopausal) female cynomolgus macaques. Material(s) and Method(s): Animals received a single total-body irradiation (TBI) exposure at doses of 0, 2 or 5 Gy with scheduled necropsies at 5 days, 8 weeks and 24 weeks post-exposure. Blood and lymphoid tissues were evaluated for morphologic, cellular, and molecular responses. Result(s): Irradiated animals developed symptoms of acute hematopoietic syndrome, and reductions in thymus weight, thymopoiesis, and bone marrow cellularity. Acute, transient increases in plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) were observed in 5 Gy animals along with dose-dependent alterations in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) signatures in thymus, spleen, and lymph node. Expression of T cell markers was lower in thymus and spleen, while expression of macrophage marker CD68 (cluster of differentiation 68) was relatively elevated in lymphoid tissues from irradiated animals. Conclusion(s): Ovariectomized female macaques exposed to moderate doses of radiation experienced increased morbidity, including acute, dose-dependent alterations in systemic and tissue-specific biomarkers, and increased macrophage/T cell ratios. The effects on mortality exceeded expectations based on previous studies in males, warranting further investigation.Copyright © 2015 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded,0.9658188
211,"In vitro fertilization rate of mouse oocytes with spermatozoa from the F1 offspring of males irradiated with 1.0 Gy 137Cs gamma-rays Previous studies suggest that the spermatozoa from acutely irradiated male mice exhibit a reduced fertilization rate in vitro with the maximum decrease occurring for spermatozoa produced 6 weeks after irradiation (Y. Matsuda et al., Mutation Res. 142 (1985) 59-63). We have found that spermatozoa from unirradiated F1 males conceived 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation also exhibit a significantly reduced fertilization rate in vitro. After acute 137Cs gamma-irradiation yielding an absorbed dose of 1.0 Gy, adult CD1 F0 male mice were mated at weekly intervals with unirradiated female CD1 mice. Unirradiated adult males from F1 litters conceived 5 and 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation were allowed to mature. Their epididymal spermatozoa were evaluated for in vitro fertilization rates using oocytes from unirradiated 8-12-week-old CD1 females. The mean fertilization rate for spermatozoa from F1 males conceived 5 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (80.74 +/- 15.74 SD %, n = 5) did not differ significantly from the control fertilization rate (89.40 +/- 10.94 SD %, n = 8). However, the fertilization rate for spermatozoa from F1 males conceived 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (56.14 +/- 21.93 SD %, n = 5) was significantly less than the fertilization rate for control spermatozoa (p < 0.006) or for that of the F1 males conceived 5 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (p < 0.04). These data suggest that spermatozoa obtained 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation can transmit a decrease in fertilization rate to the F1 generation males as well as exhibit decreased fertilization rate themselves when tested directly in vitro.",Excluded,0.9655126
190,"Changes in the Selected Antioxidant Defense Parameters in the Blood of Patients after High Resolution Computed Tomography Ionizing radiation generated during high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning may have an indirect effect on the mechanisms regulating the oxidative-antioxidant balance in the human body, which is one of the necessary factors ensuring the maintenance of its homeostasis. The aim of the study was to analyze the response of antioxidant systems through the determination of the antioxidant markers in the blood of patients exposed to oxidative stress resulting from the routine HRCT examination of the chest. Blood of 35 people aged 60.77 +/- 10.81 taken before and at four time points after the examination constituted the test material. The determination of the total antioxidant capacity expressed as ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and ferric reducing antioxidant activity and ascorbic acid concentration (FRASC) were performed together with an examination of catalase activity and the concentration of the reduced glutathione. The organism's response to ionizing radiation was associated with a significant decrease in the antioxidant markers' levels at all time-points and showed a significant negative correlation depending on the radiation dose. Visible down-regulation of these markers is a response to increased oxidative stress. In light of the obtained results, the measurement of the selected markers of antioxidant defense may be a useful parameter of oxidative stress caused by ionizing radiation.",Excluded,0.96540844

925,"Impacts of ionising radiation on sperm quality, DNA integrity and post-fertilisation development in marine and freshwater crustaceans Crustaceans have been designated as internationally important model organisms in the development of environmental radioprotection measures. Despite the known sensitivity of sperm to ionizing radiation, the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility in crustaceans have not been studied. For the first time, the present study aimed to assess the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility, sperm DNA damage and concomitant impacts on breeding in two amphipod crustaceans. Echinogammarus marinus and Gammarus pulex (male fertility only) were exposed to phosphorus-32 at dose rates of 0, 0.1, 1 and 10mGy/d and sperm parameters, DNA damage and knock-on impacts on breeding were assessed. Sperm quality parameters and DNA damage were assessed using a fluorescent staining method and single cell gel electrophoresis respectively. Concomitant effects of male exposure to radiation on fecundity were determined by pairing phosphorus-32 exposed males to unexposed sexually mature females. In E. marinus, a statistically significant reduction of 9 and 11% in the quality of sperm was recorded at dose rates of 1 and 10mGy/d respectively, with no significant effects recorded on sperm counts. Conversely in the freshwater G. pulex, no significant impact of radiation on sperm quantity or quality was recorded. For E. marinus, a statistically significant increase in DNA damage was recorded at doses of 10mGy/d. Reduced fecundity and an increase in the frequency of abnormal embryos was recorded in female E. marinus breeding with males exposed to radiation. These findings suggest sperm quality may be a sensitive indicator of radiation exposure in invertebrates with potential impacts on the unexposed embryo, though unclear dose-response and differences between two closely related species necessitate further study before robust conclusions can be drawn.

1216,"Association of radiation risk in the second and third generations with polymorphisms in the genes CYP1A1, CYP2E1, GSTP1 and changes in the thyroid Background: To study the association of radiation risk in the 2nd-3rd generations with polymorphisms in the genes CYP1A1, CYP2E1, GSTP1 and changes in the thyroid. Method(s): 5 polymorphic gene variants (rs1048943, rs4646421, rs2070676, rs3813867, rs1695) were studied in 399 people living in the East Kazakhstan region in this research. 248 people of the 2nd-3rd generation lived in the territory with radiation exposure in Abai, Borodulikha areas, and 151 people the comparison group lived in Kurchum district without radiation exposure comparable in sex and age with control group. Result(s): The results show that there is a significant association of rs1048943 in exposed and unexposed groups (p < 0.003), and the absence of association of rs4646421, rs2070676, rs3813867, rs1695 in the studied groups. The mean value of thyroxine in carriers of the AG + GG genotype of rs4646421 is significantly lower than in AA genotype carriers (p = 0.04); no significant changes were found in genotypes' distribution with thyroid-stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid peroxidase indicators. Significant changes were in levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase between exposed and unexposed groups (p = 0.007). The thyroxine-thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were not significantly different in exposed and unexposed groups (p > 0.3).

653,"The role of age, sex and steroid sex hormones in radiation cataractogenesis It is critical to identify and gain a better understanding of the factors that enhance or reduce the risk of cataractogenesis, to minimize the possibility of occurrence after deliberate (e.g., radiation therapy, interplanetary travel) or unintentional exposure to ionizing radiation. Both gender and age at the time of exposure have been established as key determinants of cataractogenesis induced by sparsely ionizing (low-LET) and densely ionizing (high-LET) radiation. However, animal data from several older studies are often conflicting and somewhat difficult to interpret, in that the experiments suffered from small group sizes, limited dose ranges or short periods of observation, and human data are sparse or statistical significance is sometimes limited. Steroid sex hormones (SSH) may underlie age and gender-based differences in the progression and prevalence of cataracts that otherwise occur spontaneously in humans and animal models, and may also underlie age and sex-related differences in radiation cataractogenesis. Here, we review data that have aided in our understanding of the role of age, sex and steroid sex hormones in radiation cataractogenesis. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded,0.964736
601,"Use of unstable chromosome aberrations for biological dosimetry after the first postirradiation mitosis The loss of unstable chromosome aberrations after the first postirradiation mitosis makes their use difficult in radiation dosimetry. We describe here a method which, in a cell population observed at this stage, allows retrospective estimation of the frequencies of the unstable aberrations induced at the time of irradiation, and their use as a dosimeter. The laws controlling the behavior of unstable aberrations during mitosis were defined from a large-scale experiment on irradiated human lymphocytes. For cells undergoing the first, second, or third mitosis after irradiation, relationships were determined between the frequency, at irradiation time, of acentric fragments not arising from formation of dicentrics or rings, and the ratio of dicentrics and centric rings appearing without acentric fragments to the total number of dicentrics plus rings. On the basis of this ratio, the method described here provides an assessment of the postirradiation mitotic activity in a cell population. This assessment permitted estimation of the cell distribution and frequency of dicentrics plus centric rings, and of the frequency of acentric fragments at the time of irradiation. The use of this method for retrospective dosimetry after whole-body irradiation under various conditions of exposure is illustrated.",Excluded,0.96467316

The risks of incidence and mortality were studied in two ranges of low annual radiation dose: 0-70 mSv per year (391 Bq m) and 0-150 mSv per year (838 Bq m). Assumption-free Bayesian statistical methods were used. The analytical results demonstrate that the published incidence and mortality data do not show that radiation dose is associated with increased risk in this range of doses. This conclusion is based on the observation that the model assuming no dependence of the lung cancer induction on the radiation doses is at least ~90 times more likely to be true than the other models tested, including the linear no-threshold (LNT) model.

Our aim was to associate the redox and inflammatory biomarkers with either nightshift working or occupational radiation exposure, and to compare their levels between the two groups at Alexandria University Hospitals, Alexandria, Egypt. Method(s): We included 150 female nurses at Alexandria University Hospitals: 50 nightshift workers, 50 radiation workers, and 50 dayshift workers as a control group (neither work nightly nor radiation workers).

627,"Pathogenetic mechanisms in immune polioencephalomyelitis: induction of disease in immunosuppressed mice Immune polioencephalomyelitis (IPE) was induced by the i.p. injection of x-irradiated (10, 000 R) syngeneic line Ib malignant lymphocytes into C58 mice that were 7 or more months old and in young mice immunosuppressed by x-ray or drugs. The occurrence of IPE in young immunosuppressed C58 mice was systematically analyzed. When mice less than 2 weeks old were x-irradiated with 600 R, IPE could not be induced. The incidence in 1-month-old mice was approximately 50% and increased progressively with the age except for a drop in incidence at 3 months. An analysis of the dose effects of x-irradiation on the occurrence of IPE in mice of different ages revealed a marked increase in the incidence in 3- and 5-month-old mice beginning at dose levels of 450 R and 300 R, respectively. Considered together, these data indicated that two subpopulations of immunocytes differing in x-ray sensitivity interacted to protect mice from IPE. It appears that under natural conditions an x-ray sensitive cell population, possibly having suppressor function, decreased with age and made mice susceptible ot induction of IPE. Five-month-old mice were immunosuppressed with an LD10 of cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, or methotrexate to determine whether mice immunosuppressed with drugs also were susceptible to the induction of IPE. The incidence was 89%, 13%, and 5%, respectively. The mouse strain specificity of IPE induction also was studied. In 6- to 8-month-old mice suppressed with 600 R, IPE could not be induced in non-H-2k strains: BALB, C57BL/6, NZB. Of the H-2K strains tested (CBA/J, C3H/He, AKR/J, C58), the disease could be induced only in the C58 and AKR/J strains. Histopathologic studies showed that CNS lesions in immunosuppressed C58 and AKR/J mice did not differ significantly from those in old C58 mice with IPE.

However, there is limited evidence of factors, other than age, that modify risk of radiation-related breast cancer. In this study, we evaluated breast cancer incidence in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors, adding 11 years of follow-up and incorporating reproductive history data. We used Poisson regression models to describe radiation risks and modifying effects of age and reproductive factors. Among 62,534 females, we identified 1,470 breast cancers between 1958 and 2009.

The ERR decreased with increasing attained age ( P = 0.007) while excess absolute rate (EAR) increased with attained age up to age 70 ( P < 0.001).

409,"Lung tumour induction in mice after uniform and non-uniform external thoracic X-irradiation The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of the ICRP procedure of using average tissue/organ dose in estimating carcinogenic risk. It has been suggested that highly non-uniform exposure ('hot spots') is much more carcinogenic than an equivalent dose delivered uniformly. In a series of experiments, mice were irradiated with X-rays either uniformly to the thorax or non-uniformly with 72 1-mm microbeams which irradiated approximately 20 per cent of the total lung volume. Two experiments involving uniform irradiation showed a peaked tumour incidence curve with a maximum at 5 Gy. The first 'microbeam' study also produced a pronounced peak in the dose response with a maximum tumour incidence at 1 Gy average lung dose or 5 Gy to the irradiated lung tissue. This implied the use of average tissue dose might underestimate the carcinogenic hazard of non-uniform exposure. Later, more extensive, microbeam experiments failed to replicate this finding. The results were nearly similar to those for uniform irradiation, with a slight increase in tumour incidence from 2.5-5.0 Gy average lung dose. These results imply that for these irradiation conditions the ICRP dose averaging procedure remains valid.",Excluded,0.96360487
35,"Biliary and pancreatic secretions in abdominal irradiation The biliary and pancreatic secretions have been determined in patients given pelvic or para-aortic irradiation, with a dose of 50 Gy in the former group and between 36 and 40 Gy in the latter. A test meal containing polyethylene glycol (PEG) as reference substance was used. Each sample of the duodenal content was assayed for volume, PEG content, amylase and trypsin activity, pH and biliary secretion. No significant modifications of biliary and pancreatic secretions were demonstrated after irradiation, suggesting that these functions are not involved in the pathogenesis of the malabsorption radiation syndrome.",Excluded,0.9634349
130,"Positive impact of low-dose, high-energy radiation on bone in partial- and/or full-weightbearing mice Astronauts traveling beyond low Earth orbit will be exposed to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR); understanding how high energy ionizing radiation modifies the bone response to mechanical unloading is important to assuring crew health. To investigate this, we exposed 4-mo-old female Balb/cBYJ mice to an acute space-relevant dose of 0.5 Gy 56Fe or sham (n = ~8/group); 4 days later, half of the mice were also subjected to a ground-based analog for 1/6 g (partial weightbearing) (G/6) for 21 days. Microcomputed tomography (-CT) of the distal femur reveals that 56Fe exposure resulted in 6578% greater volume and improved microarchitecture of cancellous bone after 21 d compared to sham controls. Radiation also leads to significant increases in three measures of energy absorption at the mid-shaft femur and an increase in stiffness of the L4 vertebra. No significant effects of radiation on bone formation indices are detected; however, G/6 leads to reduced % mineralizing surface on the inner mid-tibial bone surface. In separate groups allowed 21 days of weightbearing recovery from G/6 and/or 56Fe exposure, radiation-exposed mice still exhibit greater bone mass and improved microarchitecture vs. sham control. However, femoral bone energy absorption values are no longer higher in the 56Fe-exposed WB mice vs. sham controls. We provide evidence for persistent positive impacts of high-LET radiation exposure preceding a period of full or partial weightbearing on bone mass and microarchitecture in the distal femur and, for full weightbearing mice only and more transiently, cortical bone energy absorption values. 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.9633127

1206,"Evaluation of the reticulocyte micronucleus assay in patients treated with radioiodine for thyroid cancer In the case of accidental radiation exposure, biological dosimetry has an important role. Previous studies have indicated that the flow cytometric micronucleus (MN) assay in human transferrin receptor positive reticulocytes (Tf-Ret) in blood could be a sensitive biomarker for chromosome damage. In the present investigation, the utility and sensitivity of this method was studied in 44 young patients from Belarus, who were treated with 131I for thyroid cancer. Red marrow (RM) is the critical organ in radioiodine therapy (RIT). In our patients, it was exposed to 100-700 mSv low-dose rate irradiation within 2-4 days. About 3 days after 131I administration, the frequency of micronucleated-Tf-Ret (f(MN-Tf-Ret)) increases within 1 day to a maximum and declines in the following 2-5 days to its value before treatment. A total dose of 100 mSv was easily detectable. The sensitivity of the assay after acute irradiation may be 50 mSv. The method should be useful for monitoring individuals after a radiation accident, provided blood samples can be obtained within a few days after exposure. The time-course of f(MN-Tf-Ret) is interpreted using a model, which considers the exponential exposure of red marrow in RIT as well as the kinetics of erythroblast maturation and reticulocyte migration into the peripheral circulation. Similar modelling was done on published data of MN in immature mouse erythrocytes. Striking similarities in the kinetic and in the yield of MN-induction were found between these two species. This lends support for the use of the mouse as a model for the MN-induction in humans.",Excluded,0.963125
33,"Effects of parental radiation exposure on developmental instability in grasshoppers Mutagenic and epigenetic effects of environmental stressors and their transgenerational consequences are of interest to evolutionary biologists because they can amplify natural genetic variation. We studied the effect of parental exposure to radioactive contamination on offspring development in lesser marsh grasshopper Chorthippus albomarginatus. We used a geometric morphometric approach to measure fluctuating asymmetry (FA), wing shape and wing size. We measured time to sexual maturity to check whether parental exposure to radiation influenced offspring developmental trajectory and tested effects of radiation on hatching success and parental fecundity. Wings were larger in early maturing individuals born to parents from high radiation sites compared to early maturing individuals from low radiation sites. As time to sexual maturity increased, wing size decreased but more sharply in individuals from high radiation sites. Radiation exposure did not significantly affect FA or shape in wings nor did it significantly affect hatching success and fecundity. Overall, parental radiation exposure can adversely affect offspring development and fitness depending on developmental trajectories although the cause of this effect remains unclear. We suggest more direct measures of fitness and the inclusion of replication in future studies to help further our understanding of the relationship between developmental instability, fitness and environmental stress.

354,"Hapten-specific IgE antibody responses in mice. VI. Selective enhancement of IgE antibody production by low doses of X-irradiation and by cyclophosphamide Exposure of BALB/c, A/J, and (BALB/c X A/J)F1 mice, which are IgE high responder animals, to total body x-irradiation ranging from 50 to 200 R resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of the hapten-specific IgE antibody level as compared to unirradiated control mice. In contrast, anti-hapten antibody responses of the IgG class in these same animals were rarely enhanced, and when so, were of a lesser degree. This relatively selective augmentation of the IgE vs IgG antibody responses was observed in both unprimed and primed mice. By utilizing adoptive transfer systems, it was demonstrated that the enhancing effects of x-irradiation resulted from its action on the carrier-primed cell population and not upon the responding B cells or upon macrophages. The data presented herein suggest that this enhancement phenomenon is the result of the elimination of T cells (or their products) with suppressive functions and that these cells are neither dependent upon nor specific for the carrier antigen employed in the immunization. This hypothesis is given indirect support by the observations that treatment of the same strains of mice with cyclophosphamide, in doses known to abrogate suppressive T cell functions, resulted in a similar enhancing effect to that observed after low doses of x-irradiation. In addition an interesting difference between IgE and IgG precursor B lymphocytes was observed by the ability of IgE B cells to differentiate to the secretory state at a strikingly more rapid rate than IgG B lymphocytes when exposed to comparable T cell helper influences. These observations may provide important clues to the cellular mechanisms of the immune regulation of the IgE response and its relationship to allergic diseases.",Excluded,0.9628606

The authors assessed agreement between medical x-ray histories obtained through interview and by review of medical records from thyroid cancer case-control studies conducted in Sweden (1985-1992; 123 cases and 123 controls) and from members of a prepaid health plan in the United States (1986-1991; 50 cases and 50 controls). In both studies, substantial disagreement was found between the numbers of x-ray examinations reported in the interview and in the medical records. There was an indication of relatively poorer reporting among controls, particularly for certain types of x-ray examinations and for large numbers of such examinations. Estimates of the risk associated with exposure to diagnostic x-rays were similar, regardless of whether interview or medical record data were used, even though ordinal dose classifications based on the two sources differed considerably. In populations with a high frequency of exposure, spurious associations with numbers of x-ray examinations or estimated thyroid dose might arise because of differences in recall.

As part of a study of this phenomenon, we also investigated apoptotic response in a series of breast cancer patients lacking TP53 mutations and in a control group of individuals without cancer. There was a significant reduction in mean apoptotic response with increasing age in all groups. These findings are consistent with a number of studies in rodents, which have demonstrated a reduction in DNA damage-induced apoptosis with increasing age. In addition, after adjusting for age, breast cancer patients showed significantly reduced apoptotic responses compared with normal controls (P=0.002). The odds ratio for breast cancer in women with an apoptotic response of <35%, compared with women with a response of >49%, was 6.42 (95% CI 1.68-24.6).

In cysticercosis, previous studies have shown that irradiating (with 0.3 kGy) pork infected with Taenia solium larvae completely inhibits growth of the parasite. This study was conducted to evaluate the mechanisms that induce the effect of gamma irradiation on metacestodes of T. solium. Metacestodes were obtained from several infected pigs and irradiated with a dose of 0.3 kGy. The viability of the metacestodes was evaluated by their capacity to evaginate in vitro and in vivo development to tapeworms after they were orally infected into prednisolone-treated golden hamsters. Using the typical ladder pattern of fragmented DNA and the TdT-mediated DUTP-nick-end labeling assay, apoptosis was evaluated in metacestodes after irradiation and in the scolices and tapeworms recovered from infected hamsters at 21 days post-infection. Apoptosis was observed in the structure of scolices obtained from hamsters at 21 days post-infection with irradiated metacestodes, This study provides evidence of the existence of apoptosis in the irradiated metacestodes of T. solium and helps elucidate the possible mechanisms that are involved when gamma irradiation inhibits the normal development of the T. solium metacestode into the adult worm.",Excluded,0.9622151

The hazard functions (age-specific risks) for incidence of lung, bone and liver tumors were modeled as a function of cumulative radiation dose, and estimates of lifetime risks based on the combined data were developed. For lung tumors, linear-quadratic functions provided an adequate fit to the data from both laboratories, and linear functions provided an adequate fit when analyses were restricted to doses less than 20 Gy. The estimated risk coefficients for these functions were significantly larger when based on ITRI data compared to PNNL data, and dosimetry biases are a possible explanation for this difference. There was also evidence that the bone tumor response functions differed for the two laboratories, although these differences occurred primarily at high doses. These functions were clearly nonlinear (even when restricted to average skeletal doses less than 1 Gy), and evidence of radiation-induced bone tumors was found for doses less than 0.5 Gy in both laboratories. Liver tumor risks were similar for the two laboratories, and linear functions provided an adequate fit to these data. Lifetime risk estimates for lung and bone tumors derived from these data had wide confidence intervals, but were consistent with estimates currently used in radiation protection. The dog-based lifetime liver tumor risk estimate was an order of magnitude larger than that used in radiation protection, but the latter also carries large uncertainties. The application of common statistical methodology to data from two studies has allowed the identification of differences in these studies and has provided a basis for common risk estimates based on both data sets.",Excluded,0.96211284

All the patients underwent saccharin particle test for nasal mucociliary clearance before commencement of radiation therapy and again within 6 months of completion of radiation therapy. The difference between the saccharin perception times of nasal mucosa in the healthy non-irradiated controls and the pre-irradiated head and neck cancer patients were statistically insignificant (P> 0.05). But, the difference between the saccharin perception times of nasal mucosa in the pre- and post-irradiated head and neck cancer patients was found to be statistically significant (P=0).

749,"Acute vasculitis after endovascular brachytherapy PURPOSE: Angioplasty effectively relieves coronary artery stenosis but is often followed by restenosis. Endovascular radiation (beta or gamma) at the time of angioplasty prevents restenosis in a large proportion of vessels in swine (short term) and humans (short and long term). Little information is available about the effects of this radiation exposure beyond the wall of the coronary arteries., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Samples were obtained from 76 minipigs in the course of several experiments designed to evaluate endovascular brachytherapy: 76 of 114 coronary arteries and 6 of 12 iliac arteries were exposed to endovascular radiation from 32P sources (35 Gy at 0.5 mm from the intima). Two-thirds of the vessels had angioplasty or stenting. The vessels were systematically examined either at 28 days or at 6 months after radiation., RESULTS: We found an unexpected lesion: acute necrotizing vasculitis in arterioles located < or =2.05 mm from the target artery. It was characterized by fibrinoid necrosis of the wall, often associated with lymphocytic exudates or thrombosis. Based on the review of perpendicular sections of tissue samples, the arterioles had received between 6 and 40 Gy. This arteriolar vasculitis occurred at 28 days in samples from 51% of irradiated coronary arteries and 100% of irradiated iliac arteries. By 6 months, the incidence of acute vasculitis decreased to 24% around the coronary arteries. However, at that time, healing vasculitis was evident, often with luminal narrowing, in 46% of samples. Vasculitis was not seen in any of 44 samples from unirradiated vessels (0%) and had no relation to angioplasty, stenting, or their sequelae. This radiation-associated vasculitis in the swine resembles the localized lymphocytic vasculitis that we have reported in tissues of humans exposed to external radiation. On the other hand, it is quite different from the various types of systemic vasculitis that occur in nonirradiated humans., CONCLUSION: Endoarterial brachytherapy using 32P results in vascular effects beyond the adventitia of the target vessel. This necrotizing vasculitis is causally related to radiation, but its mechanism is unclear and a dose effect is not evident. Quite possibly, local upregulation of inflammatory cytokines contributes to this radiation-associated vasculitis, which only involved some of the arterioles in each sample. It is likely that radiation-associated vasculitis also occurs around human coronary arteries and may result in foci of ischemia. To our knowledge, this lesion has not been previously recognized, either in experimental models or in human specimens examined after angioplasty/brachytherapy.",Excluded,0.9609515
293,"Harderian Gland Tumorigenesis: Low-Dose and LET Response Increased cancer risk remains a primary concern for travel into deep space and may preclude manned missions to Mars due to large uncertainties that currently exist in estimating cancer risk from the spectrum of radiations found in space with the very limited available human epidemiological radiation-induced cancer data. Existing data on human risk of cancer from X-ray and gamma-ray exposure must be scaled to the many types and fluences of radiations found in space using radiation quality factors and dose-rate modification factors, and assuming linearity of response since the shapes of the dose responses at low doses below 100 mSv are unknown. The goal of this work was to reduce uncertainties in the relative biological effect (RBE) and linear energy transfer (LET) relationship for space-relevant doses of charged-particle radiation-induced carcinogenesis. The historical data from the studies of Fry et al. and Alpen et al. for Harderian gland (HG) tumors in the female CB6F1 strain of mouse represent the most complete set of experimental observations, including dose dependence, available on a specific radiation-induced tumor in an experimental animal using heavy ion beams that are found in the cosmic radiation spectrum. However, these data lack complete information on low-dose responses below 0.1 Gy, and for chronic low-dose-rate exposures, and there are gaps in the LET region between 25 and 190 keV/mum. In this study, we used the historical HG tumorigenesis data as reference, and obtained HG tumor data for 260 MeV/u silicon (LET ~70 keV/mum) and 1,000 MeV/u titanium (LET ~100 keV/mum) to fill existing gaps of data in this LET range to improve our understanding of the dose-response curve at low doses, to test for deviations from linearity and to provide RBE estimates. Animals were also exposed to five daily fractions of 0.026 or 0.052 Gy of 1,000 MeV/u titanium ions to simulate chronic exposure, and HG tumorigenesis from this fractionated study were compared to the results from single 0.13 or 0.26 Gy acute titanium exposures. Theoretical modeling of the data show that a nontargeted effect model provides a better fit than the targeted effect model, providing important information at space-relevant doses of heavy ions.",Excluded,0.9603361

The objective of this study was to investigate the influence time of time of day, age, irradiation, mating status, and the presence of host fruit on the release of volatile components by laboratory-reared A. obliqua males. A. obliqua males released four compounds identified by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as (E,E)-alpha-farnesene, (Z,E)-alpha-farnesene, (Z)-3-nonenol, and a farnesene isomer during calling behavior. Although males released volatiles during the entire day, the amount of volatiles was higher in the early morning and afternoon hours. Males began to emit volatiles when they were 6 d old, but only the amount of (Z)-3-nonenol was affected by age. Irradiation of flies with gamma rays from a 60Co source at a dose rate of 80 [corrected] Gy significantly reduced the amount of volatiles released during calling behavior.

We also investigated the possibility of expanding ex vivo the residual progenitors exposed to different dose levels of TBI., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight patients treated for AML (n = 3) and myeloma (n = 5) were included. BM and PB samples were harvested before TBI and after doses of: 5 Gy. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were assayed for burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), granulocyte-forming unit macrophage (CFU-GM), and long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-ICs). Ex vivo expansion: MNCs (after irradiation and controls) were suspended in long-term cultures and expanded with a combination of five cytokines., RESULTS: CD34+ cells were detectable at 10 Gy. We observed a significant decrease of CFU-GM and BFU-E, respectively, to 13.5% and 8.5% of baseline values for doses <or=2 Gy and to 8.2% and 4.6% for doses ranging between 2.1 and 5 Gy. No dose effect was observed for residual MNCs. LTC-ICs were not detectable after 0.8 Gy. The expansion was not successful after 1.2 Gy., CONCLUSION: This study confirms the significant decrease of human mature and immature progenitors in BM and PB immediately after low-dose TBI. In addition, the lack of expansion suggests that autografting using BM or PB residual stem cells collected and expanded in vitro in case of accidental whole body exposure may be impractical.",Excluded,0.9583813

621,"Lifelong hematopoiesis in both reconstituted and sublethally irradiated mice is provided by multiple sequentially recruited stem cells Objective. To evaluate the dynamics of stem cell production to hematopoiesis, the number of active stem cell clones and the lifespan of individual clones were studied. Materials and Methods. The clonal contribution of primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) responsible for long-term hematopoiesis was determined using two approaches. In one model, irradiated female mice were reconstituted with retrovirally marked male hematopoietic cells. In the second model, mice were irradiated sublethally without hematopoietic cell transplantation. In both models, bone marrow cells were serially sampled from the same mouse throughout a 12- to 20-month period and injected into irradiated recipients for analysis of day 10 colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S). The donor origin of CFU-S was determined by the presence of retrovirally marked cells or cells with chromosomal aberrations. Results. The results of the two essentially different models show that 1) hematopoiesis is mainly the product of small clones of hematopoietic cells; 2) the lifespan of the majority of clones is only 1 to 2 months; 3) the clones usually function locally; and 4) the vast majority of the clones replace one another sequentially. Primitive HSCs capable of producing long-lived clones (about 10% among all clones), which exist during the entire life of a mouse, were detected by the radiation-marker technique only. Conclusion.

However, the effects of radiation therapy on telomere DNA of non-cancer tissue have not been thoroughly investigated. This study analyzed the telomere length of inpatients with cancer treated with radiation therapy to see whether the telomere lengths change in response to therapeutic radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-five patients were enrolled in the study. The patients had lung cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatoma, or rectal cancer. They received radiation therapy with a dose range of 15-74 Gy. The telomere lengths and telomere length distribution in peripheral leukocytes were analyzed by using a Southern blot-based method. Result(s): The telomere length and the telomere length distribution of the peripheral leukocytes did not change after radiation therapy. However, there was a significant proportional decrease in the short telomere fraction (< 4.4 kb) per day and per Gy. Conclusion(s): This observation suggested that the telomere length distribution of peripheral leukocytes could be affected by radiation therapy, and that the effect of radiation tends to appear in cells with short telomeres. Radiation therapy-associated somatic telomere length change within a short range of time, about three months or shorter, can be detected by analyzing the mean telomere length and telomere length distribution. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded,0.9572208

In this study, the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) method was employed to investigate acute and late chromosomal damage (CD) in the peripheral lymphocytes of 15 patients who received various doses of (131)I (259-3,700 MBq), either for thyrotoxicosis (TTX) or for ablation treatment in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). The SCE frequencies in cultured peripheral lymphocytes were determined before treatment (to assess basal SCE frequencies), on the 3rd day (to assess acute SCE frequencies) and 6 months later (to assess late SCE frequencies). The basal, acute and late SCE frequencies (mean+/-SD) were 3.19+/-0.93, 10.83+/-1.72 and 5.75+/-2.06, respectively, in the whole group, and these values differed significantly from each other ( P<0.001). In order to perform a quantitative evaluation of the present data and a comparative analysis with the results of previous studies reported in the literature, we defined acute and late effects using a ""damage ratio"" (DR) and a ""recovery ratio"" (RR), based on the basal, acute and late data for individual patients. No statistically significant difference was found in the DR between DTC and TTX patients (76.4%+/-11.5% vs 67.6%+/-9.0%), while the mean RR was higher in TTX patients than in the DTC group (75.2%+/-24.4% vs 36.8%+/-13.7%). The DR on the 3rd day was not related to the administered (131)I dose in the whole group, but a negative correlation was found between the (131)I dose and the RR at the 6th month (r=-0.60, P=0.04). The best fit for this relationship was obtained by a linear-quadratic model, as y=104.89x-28.4x(2)+38.1 ( R(2)=0.51, P=0.04). On the other hand, comparative analysis with the results of previous studies with comparable sampling times revealed that the best fit for the relationships between the administered dose of (131)I and DR and RR were obtained with a linear-quadratic model (Y=alpha D+beta D(2)) rather than a linear one. However, there was an interesting difference in comparison with in vitro studies, in that we found the coefficient beta to have a negative value, suggesting the disappearance of damaged lymphocytes from the peripheral circulation in a dose-dependent manner following (131)I treatment.

477,"Flexible Modeling of the Association between Cumulative Exposure to Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation from Cardiac Procedures and Risk of Cancer in Adults with Congenital Heart Disease Adults with congenital heart disease are increasingly being exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) from cardiac procedures. In a recent study, Cohen et al. (Circulation. 2018;137(13):1334-1345) reported an association between increased LDIR exposure and cancer incidence but did not explore temporal relationships. Yet, the impact of past exposures probably accumulates over years, and its strength may depend on the amount of time elapsed since exposure. Furthermore, LDIR procedures performed shortly before a cancer diagnosis may have been ordered because of early symptoms of cancer, raising concerns about reversal causality bias. To address these challenges, we combined flexible modeling of cumulative exposures with competing-risks methodology to estimate separate associations of time-varying LDIR exposure with cancer incidence and all-cause mortality. Among 24,833 patients from the Quebec Congenital Heart Disease Database, 602 had incident cancer and 500 died during a follow-up period of up to 15 years (1995-2010). Initial results suggested a strong association of cancer incidence with very recent LDIR exposures, likely reflecting reverse causality bias. When exposure was lagged by 2 years, an increased cumulative LDIR dose from the previous 2-6 years was associated with increased cancer incidence, with a stronger association for women. These results illustrate the importance of accurate modeling of temporal relationships between time-varying exposures and health outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

542,"Combining paratransgenesis with SIT: impact of ionizing radiation on the DNA copy number of Sodalis glossinidius in tsetse flies BACKGROUND: Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are the cyclical vectors of the causative agents of African Trypanosomosis, which has been identified as a neglected tropical disease in both humans and animals in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa. The sterile insect technique (SIT) has shown to be a powerful method to manage tsetse fly populations when used in the frame of an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) program. To date, the release of sterile males to manage tsetse fly populations has only been implemented in areas to reduce transmission of animal African Trypanosomosis (AAT). The implementation of the SIT in areas with Human African Trypanosomosis (HAT) would require additional measures to eliminate the potential risk associated with the release of sterile males that require blood meals to survive and hence, might contribute to disease transmission. Paratransgenesis offers the potential to develop tsetse flies that are refractory to trypanosome infection by modifying their associated bacteria (Sodalis glossinidius) here after referred to as Sodalis. Here we assessed the feasibility of combining the paratransgenesis approach with SIT by analyzing the impact of ionizing radiation on the copy number of Sodalis and the vectorial capacity of sterilized tsetse males., RESULTS: Adult Glossina morsitans morsitans that emerged from puparia irradiated on day 22 post larviposition did not show a significant decline in Sodalis copy number as compared with non-irradiated flies. Conversely, the Sodalis copy number was significantly reduced in adults that emerged from puparia irradiated on day 29 post larviposition and in adults irradiated on day 7 post emergence. Moreover, irradiating 22-day old puparia reduced the copy number of Wolbachia and Wigglesworthia in emerged adults as compared with non-irradiated controls, but the radiation treatment had no significant impact on the vectorial competence of the flies., CONCLUSION: Although the radiation treatment significantly reduced the copy number of some tsetse fly symbionts, the copy number of Sodalis recovered with time in flies irradiated as 22-day old puparia. This recovery offers the opportunity to combine a paratransgenesis approach - using modified Sodalis to produce males refractory to trypanosome infection - with the release of sterile males to minimize the risk of disease transmission, especially in HAT endemic areas. Moreover, irradiation did not increase the vector competence of the flies for trypanosomes.",Excluded,0.9557184
88,"The role of thiols in cellular response to radiation and drugs Cellular nonprotein thiols (NPSH) consist of glutathione (GSH) and other low molecular weight species such as cysteine, cysteamine, and coenzyme A. GSH is usually less than the total cellular NPSH, and with thiol reactive agents, such as diethyl maleate (DEM), its rate of depletion is in part dependent upon the cellular capacity for its resynthesis. If resynthesis is blocked by buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine(BSO), the NPSH, including GSH, is depleted more rapidly, Cellular thiol depletion by diamide, N-ethylmaleimide, and BSO may render oxygenated cells more sensitive to radiation. These cells may or may not show a reduction in the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER). Human A549 lung carcinoma cells depleted of their NPSH either by prolonged culture or by BSO treatment do not show a reduced OER but do show increased aerobic responses to radiation. Some nitroheterocyclic radiosensitizing drugs also deplete cellular thiols under aerobic conditions. Such reactivity may be the reason that they show anomalous radiation sensitization (i.e., better than predicted on the basis of electron affinity). Other nitrocompounds, such as misonidazole, are activated under hypoxic conditions to radical intermediates. When cellular thiols are depleted peroxide is formed. Under hypoxic conditions thiols are depleted because metabolically reduced intermediates react with GSH instead of oxygen. Thiol depletion, under hypoxic conditions, may be the reason that misonidazole and other nitrocompounds show an extra enhancement ratio with hypoxic cells. Thiol depletion by DEM or BSO alters the radiation response of hypoxic cells to misonidazole. In conclusion, we propose an altered thiol model which includes a mechanism for thiol involvement in the aerobic radiation response of cells. This mechanism involves both thiol-linked hydrogen donation to oxygen radical adducts to produce hydroperoxides followed by a GSH peroxidase-catalyzed reduction of the hydroperoxides to intermediates entering into metabolic pathways to produce the original molecule.",Excluded,0.95541984

128,"Cancer incidence and mortality in populations living near uranium milling and mining operations in grants, New Mexico, 1950-2004 In a previous cohort study of workers engaged in uranium milling and mining activities near Grants, Cibola County, New Mexico, we found lung cancer mortality to be significantly increased among underground miners. Uranium mining took place from early in the 1950s to 1990, and the Grants Uranium Mill operated from 1958-1990. The present study evaluates cancer mortality during 1950-2004 and cancer incidence during 1982-2004 among county residents. Standardized mortality (SMR) and incidence (SIR) ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed, with observed numbers of cancer deaths and cases compared to expected values based on New Mexico cancer rates. The total numbers of cancer deaths and incident cancers were close to that expected (SMR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07; SIR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.02). Lung cancer mortality and incidence were significantly increased among men (SMR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21; SIR 1.40, 95% CI 1.18-1.64) but not women (SMR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85-1.10; SIR 1.01, 95% CI 0.78-1.29). Similarly, among the population of the three census tracts near the Grants Uranium Mill, lung cancer mortality was significantly elevated among men (SMR 1.57; 95% CI 1.21-1.99) but not women (SMR 1.12; 95% CI 0.75-1.61). Except for an elevation in mortality for stomach cancer among women (SMR 1.30; 95% CI 1.03-1.63), which declined over the 55-year observation period, no significant increases in SMRs or SIRs for 22 other cancers were found. Although etiological inferences cannot be drawn from these ecological data, the excesses of lung cancer among men seem likely to be due to previously reported risks among underground miners from exposure to radon gas and its decay products. Smoking, socioeconomic factors or ethnicity may also have contributed to the lung cancer excesses observed in our study. The stomach cancer increase was highest before the uranium mill began operation and then decreased to normal levels. With the exception of male lung cancer, this study provides no clear or consistent evidence that the operation of uranium mills and mines adversely affected cancer incidence or mortality of county residents.",Excluded,0.9541466

Here we describe that hairless XPA-deficient mice also develop skin tumors with a short latency time and a 100% prevalence after daily exposure to low doses of U.V.B. Surprisingly and in contrast to U.V.B.-exposed repair proficient hairless mice who mainly develop squamous cell carcinomas, the XPA-deficient mice developed papillomas with a high frequency (31%) at a U.V. dose of 32 J/m2 daily. At the highest daily dose of 80 J/m2 mainly squamous cell carcinomas (56%) and only 10% of papillomas were found in XPA-deficient hairless mice. p53 gene mutations were examined in exons 5, 7 and 8 and were detected in only 3 out of 37 of these skin tumors, whereas in tumors of control U.V.B.-irradiated wild type littermates this frequency was higher (45%) and more in line with our previous data. Strikingly, a high incidence of activating ras gene mutations were observed in U.V.B.-induced papillomas (in 11 out of 14 tumors analysed). In only two out of 14 squamous cell carcinomas we found similar ras gene mutations. The observed shift from squamous cell carcinomas in wild type hairless mice to papillomas in XPA-deficient hairless mice, and a corresponding shift in mutated cancer genes in these tumors, provide new clues on the pathogenesis of chemically- versus U.V.B.-induced skin carcinogenesis.",Excluded,0.9529254

419,"Loss of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 causes increased tumour latency in p53-deficient mice PARP-1-deficient mice display a severe defect in the base excision repair pathway leading to radiosensitivity and genomic instability. They are protected against necrosis induced by massive oxidative stress in various inflammatory processes. Mice lacking p53 are highly predisposed to malignancy resulting from defective cell cycle checkpoints, resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis as well as from upregulation of the iNOS gene resulting in chronic oxidative stress. Here, we report the generation of doubly null mutant mice. We found that tumour-free survival of parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice increased by 50% compared with that of parp- 1(+/+)p53(-/-) mice. Tumour formation in nude mice injected with oncogenic parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) fibroblasts was significantly delayed compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) cells. Upon gamma-irradiation, a partial restoration of S-phase radiosensitivity was found in parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) primary fibroblasts compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) cells. In addition, iNOS expression and nitrite release were dramatically reduced in the parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) mice. The abrogation of the oxydated status of p53(-/-) cells, due to the absence of parp-1, may be the cause of the delay in the onset of tumorigenesis in parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice.",Excluded,0.95054436

Cytogenetic tests were conducted on 2396 healthy Hungarian individuals and cancer incidence was followed up from 1989 to 2018. Venous blood samples were obtained from the subjects and metaphases from lymphocyte cultures were prepared. We compared the CA frequencies of the various smoking (1-5; 6-10; 11-19; or 20-40 cigarettes/day) and exposure (irradiation; chemical industry; chemical research laboratory) groups. Chromatid break (p = 0.0002), total aberration (p = 0.002), and aberrant cell (p = 0.001) frequencies were higher in smokers than in non-smokers. For very heavy smokers, total CAs were significantly higher than for non-smokers (<0.001) or less intensive smokers (p = 0.003-0.0006). Intensity of smoking was a predictor of chromosomal aberrations, while duration was not. During follow-up, 177 (7.3 %) cancer cases were found. A Cox-regression model showed that subjects with cell values >=2 CAs developed cancer more frequently (hazard ratio = 1.39; 95 % CI, 1.02-1.90). The relative risks of cancer were 1.06 (95 % CI 0.53-2.06) for light smokers and 1.74 (95 % CI 1.08-2.77) for very heavy smokers. The distributions of cancer sites showed differences between smoker and non-smoker groups: in male smokers, lung cancer, in non-smokers, prostate, and in females (both groups) breast cancer were most common. Cancer incidence correlated with chromosome aberrations; smoking was not a confounder in this relationship.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.9494253

More recent work has shown that high rates of NPC are also associated with high levels of uranium and thorium in the soil. These latest findings are consistent with the earlier ones, since uranium and thorium occur predominantly in acid rocks poor in magnesium. Uranium and thorium are radioactive, and their progeny include radioactive elements such as radium and radon. Whether or not naturally occurring radioactive elements could be risk factors in NPC should, therefore, be further investigated. Direct carcinogenic properties of radon are well known, but in connection with NPC possibilities for reactivation of virus by natural ionizing radiation should also be considered.

474,"Patterns of diagnostic imaging and associated radiation exposure among long-term survivors of young adult cancer: a population-based cohort study BACKGROUND: Survivors of young adult malignancies are at risk of accumulated exposures to radiation from repetitive diagnostic imaging. We designed a population-based cohort study to describe patterns of diagnostic imaging and cumulative diagnostic radiation exposure among survivors of young adult cancer during a survivorship time period where surveillance imaging is not typically warranted., METHODS: Young adults aged 20-44 diagnosed with invasive malignancy in Ontario from 1992-1999 who lived at least 5 years from diagnosis were identified using the Ontario Cancer Registry and matched 5 to 1 to randomly selected cancer-free persons. We determined receipt of 5 modalities of diagnostic imaging and associated radiation dose received by survivors and controls from years 5-15 after diagnosis or matched referent date through administrative data. Matched pairs were censored six months prior to evidence of recurrence., RESULTS: 20,911 survivors and 104,524 controls had a median of 13.5 years observation. Survivors received all modalities of diagnostic imaging at significantly higher rates than controls. Survivors received CT at a 3.49-fold higher rate (95% Confidence Interval [CI]:3.37, 3.62) than controls in years 5 to 15 after diagnosis. Survivors received a mean radiation dose of 26 miliSieverts solely from diagnostic imaging in the same time period, a 4.57-fold higher dose than matched controls (95% CI: 4.39, 4.81)., CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survivors of young adult cancer have a markedly higher rate of diagnostic imaging over time than matched controls, imaging associated with substantial radiation exposure, during a time period when surveillance is not routinely recommended.",Excluded,0.94560474

Routine brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DTI were conducted in all patients before and during radiotherapy (radiation dose was 20, 40, and 60 Gy, respectively). The MRI and DTI were also performed in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd month after radiotherapy in 47 cases of 80 patients. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of DTI during different stages were dynamically observed and analyzed., RESULTS: The ADC values were increased and the FA values were decreased with the increase of radiation dose (20, 40, and 60 Gy) during the radiotherapy, but there was no significant difference in ADC value or FA value between before and during radiotherapy (p>0.05). Compared with before radiotherapy, the ADC values were significantly increased and the FA values were significantly decreased at the 1st month, 2nd month, and 3rd month after radiotherapy (all p<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging reflects the microstructure change of radiation-induced brain injury in the acute and subacute stage, which provides an objective basis for early intervention of potential irreversible brain injury in the late delayed stage, and has important significance for improving the overall efficacy of radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.9446248
528,"Analysis of EPR and FISH studies of radiation doses in persons who lived in the upper reaches of the Techa River Waterborne radioactive releases into the Techa River from the Mayak Production Association in Russia during 1949-1956 resulted in significant doses to about 30,000 persons who lived in downstream settlements. The residents were exposed to internal and external radiation. Two methods for reconstruction of the external dose are considered in this paper, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements of teeth, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) measurements of chromosome translocations in circulating lymphocytes. The main issue in the application of the EPR and FISH methods for reconstruction of the external dose for the Techa Riverside residents was strontium radioisotopes incorporated in teeth and bones that act as a source of confounding local exposures. In order to estimate and subtract doses from incorporated (89,90)Sr, the EPR and FISH assays were supported by measurements of (90)Sr-body burdens and estimates of (90)Sr concentrations in dental tissues by the luminescence method. The resulting dose estimates derived from EPR to FISH measurements for residents of the upper Techa River were found to be consistent: The mean values vary from 510 to 550 mGy for the villages located close to the site of radioactive release to 130-160 mGy for the more distant villages. The upper bound of individual estimates for both methods is equal to 2.2-2.3 Gy. The EPR- and FISH-based dose estimates were compared with the doses calculated for the donors using the most recent Techa River Dosimetry System (TRDS). The TRDS external dose assessments are based on the data on contamination of the Techa River floodplain, simulation of air kerma above the contaminated soil, age-dependent lifestyles and individual residence histories. For correct comparison, TRDS-based doses were calculated from two sources: external exposure from the contaminated environment and internal exposure from (137)Cs incorporated in donors' soft tissues. It is shown here that the TRDS-based absorbed doses in tooth enamel and muscle are in agreement with EPR- and FISH-based estimates within uncertainty bounds. Basically, this agreement between the estimates has confirmed the validity of external doses calculated with the TRDS.",Excluded,0.94377285
337,"IL-6 promotes stemness of cancer stem cells and may contribute to radiation resistance of non-small cell lung cancer Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among both men and women. Long-term survival of lung cancer patients remains low despite aggressive therapies including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Ionizing radiation (IR) is the standard therapy for patients diagnosed with localized unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However local tumor control by standard fractionated radiotherapy (RT) remains poor due to tumor resistance to IR. Accumulating evidences have indicated that cancer stem cells (CSCs, also known as cancer initiating cells) exist as a very minor population in NSCLC tumors, which are composed of heterogeneous cell populations. Our laboratory and others found that CSC population increases upon irradiation, which may contribute to radiation resistance. The role of IL-6 in NSCLC progression has been suggested since high IL-6 levels were detected in sera of lung cancer patients, but not detectable in most patients with benign lung diseases. However, the exact mechanism by which IL-6 influences lung cancer progression and its role in CSCs mediated radioresistance remain unresolved. Method(s): We isolated CD133+ CSC population from 3 NSCLC cell lines (NSCLC-CSCs) and studied the role of IL-6 in CD133+ CSCs growth by treating cells with IL-6. In addition, we manipulated IL-6 expression levels in the IL-6 expressing A549 and H157 cells by the knockdown of IL-6 using lentiviral infection system carrying IL-6siRNA and isolated CD133+ cells for further analyses. The growth and stem cell marker expressions of these CSCs, IL-6 treated or non-treated, or IL-6 expressing or knocked down cells upon irradiation were then investigated. The differences in the activation of signaling pathways and neuroendocrine differentiation were also studied. Results and Conclusion(s): We found that IL-6 increased self-renewal of NSCLC-CSCs significantly and thereby increased NSCLC-CSC population. We also found that IL-6 increased stemness of the isolated CD133+ CSCs when CD133+ cells were treated with IL-6. More importantly, when we irradiated the CD133+ CSCs isolated from the IL-6 knocked down and scramble control A549 cells, we found that the CSCs isolated from the IL-6 knocked down cells exhibited lower survival than the CSCs of control cells. Therefore, we suggest that IL-6 may contribute to NSCLC-CSCs mediated-radioresistance via (i) direct triggering radioresistance, and (ii) increasing self-renewal and stemness of the survived CSCs. Mechanistic dissection studies revealed that the increased self-renewal of CSCs by IL-6 is due to the activation of the hedgehog signaling and the increased expression of bcl-2, while the IL-6 mediated increase of radioresistance is due to the activation of neuroendocrine differentiation, Stat 3 signaling pathway, and increased expression of bcl-2.",Excluded,0.94325477

No approved prophylaxis or therapy exists for these toxicities, in part reflecting an incomplete understanding of mechanisms contributing to the acute radiation-induced GI syndrome (RIGS). Guanylate cyclase C (GUCY2C) and its hormones guanylin and uroguanylin have recently emerged as one paracrine axis defending intestinal mucosal integrity against mutational, chemical, and inflammatory injury. Here, we reveal a role for the GUCY2C paracrine axis in compensatory mechanisms opposing RIGS. Eliminating GUCY2C signaling exacerbated RIGS, amplifying radiation-induced mortality, weight loss, mucosal bleeding, debilitation, and intestinal dysfunction. Durable expression of GUCY2C, guanylin, and uroguanylin mRNA and protein by intestinal epithelial cells was preserved following lethal irradiation inducing RIGS. Oral delivery of the heat-stable enterotoxin (ST), an exogenous GUCY2C ligand, opposed RIGS, a process requiring p53 activation mediated by dissociation from MDM2. In turn, p53 activation prevented cell death by selectively limiting mitotic catastrophe, but not apoptosis. These studies reveal a role for the GUCY2C paracrine hormone axis as a novel compensatory mechanism opposing RIGS, and they highlight the potential of oral GUCY2C agonists (Linzess; Trulance) to prevent and treat RIGS in cancer therapy and nuclear disasters.Copyright ©2017 AACR.",Excluded,0.93233293

And nowadays, no effective biological markers have been identified for predicting the prognosis of patients with ESCC. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is associated with a poor prognosis of various malignancies. The present study aimed to assess the effect of PDGF-BB on radiotherapeutic responses of ESCC and the underlying mechanisms of its roles in ESCC. Serum from 68 cases that received neoadjuvant or radical radiotherapy was obtained before and during radiotherapy. Gene expression analyses were validated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The prognosis of patients with significantly reduced PDGF-BB was probably better than that of the others found in the progression-free survival and overall survival groups. Depletion of PDGFB significantly suppressed the proliferation, invasion and migration of cancer cells. Inhibiting PDGFB induced cellular apoptosis and promoted the sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR). Furthermore, IR inhibited PDGF-BB-induced migration by blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway in ESCC cells. We found that the expression of PDGF-BB provided a possible model for predicting ESCC radiotherapy. It can also be used as a prognostic indicator for locally advanced ESCC that was treated by radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.9297093

In this work, an environmental release of radioactive Cs-137 was simulated and the resulting relative risk for solid cancer incidence among the affected population calculated. The HotSpot health physics code was used to simulate the radioactive atmospheric dispersion and calculate the Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE), which was then used to estimate the relative risk of cancer incidence. The main results from this work suggest that the relative cancer risk and atmospheric stability classes are linked by differences in the TEDE. Such a finding may support triage, because it adds additional information on the potentially affected population at the early stages of an emergency response.",Excluded,0.9293146
421,"Temozolomide and irradiation combined treatment-induced Nrf2 activation increases chemoradiation sensitivity in human glioblastoma cells Resistance to chemoradiotherapy is a major obstacle to successful treatment of glioblastoma. Recently, the role of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity has been reported in several types of cancers. Here, we investigated whether temozolomide (TMZ) and irradiation (IR) combined treatment induced Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells. And we further performed a preliminary study about the effect of Nrf2 on chemoradiation sensitivity. Immunohistochemical staining for Nrf2 in paired clinical specimens showed that TMZ and IR combined treatment increased the expression and nuclear localization of Nrf2 in human glioblastoma tissues. Moreover, we found nuclear Nrf2 expression in the glioblastoma tissues obtained from the patients undergoing TMZ and IR combined treatment was associated with the time to tumor recurrence. In vitro, we further verified these findings. First, we detected increased nuclear localization of Nrf2 following treatment with TMZ+IR in human glioblastoma cell lines. Second, we demonstrated TMZ+IR increased the levels of Nrf2 protein in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of U251 cells and induced Nrf2 target genes expression. Finally, downregulating Nrf2 expression increased TMZ+IR-induced cell death in the U251 cells. These findings suggest TMZ+IR combined treatment induces Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells. The activation of Nrf2 may be associate with enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity in human glioblastoma cell. Blocking Nrf2 activation may be a promising method enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity of glioblastoma cells.",Excluded,0.92887473
930,"Bone marrow-derived cells rescue salivary gland function in mice with head and neck irradiation Treatment for most patients with head and neck cancers includes ionizing radiation. A consequence of this treatment is irreversible damage to salivary glands (SGs), which is accompanied by a loss of fluid-secreting acinar-cells and a considerable decrease of saliva output. While there are currently no adequate conventional treatments for this condition, cell-based therapies are receiving increasing attention to regenerate SGs. In this study, we investigated whether bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) can differentiate into salivary epithelial cells and restore SG function in head and neck irradiated mice. BMDCs from male mice were transplanted into the tail-vein of 18 Gy-irradiated female mice. Salivary output was increased in mice that received BMDCs transplantation at week 8 and 24 post-irradiation. At 24 weeks after irradiation (IR), harvested SGs (submandibular and parotid glands) of BMDC-treated mice had greater weights than those of non-treated mice. Histological analysis shows that SGs of treated mice demonstrated an increased level of tissue regenerative activity such as blood vessel formation and cell proliferation, while apoptotic activity was increased in non-transplanted mice. The expression of stem cell markers (Sca-1 or c-kit) was detected in BMDC-treated SGs. Finally, we detected an increased ratio of acinar-cell area and approximately 9% of Y-chromosome-positive (donor-derived) salivary epithelial cells in BMDC-treated mice. We propose here that cell therapy using BMDCs can rescue the functional damage of irradiated SGs by direct differentiation of donor BMDCs into salivary epithelial cells. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

199,"A prospective assessment of radiotherapy (RT)- Induced early functional renal changes by means of 23Na-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Purpose: Radiation-induced renal damage is an important side effect for patients with long-term survival after abdominal RT. Time course of post-RT functional and morphological renal changes is unknown. MRI with 23Na imaging is a novel technique which provides functional kidney assessment. In a previous analysis, for long-term survivors of gastric cancer, late radiation induced changes in the kidney regions exposed to high doses but no alterations in regions exposed to intermediate/low doses were observed. Morphological and functional assessment in the acute post-RT phase in comparison to baseline values are missing. The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate kidney alterations and to correlate them to focal renal radiation doses before and early after abdominal RT. Patients/Methods: 3 pats without any known pre-RT kidney disease who were to undergo RT for abdominal sarcoma and B-NHL, respectively, were examined on a 3.0T scanner before and 2-6 weeks post-RT. In addition to T1- and T2w morphological sequences, 23Na images were obtained using a dedicated 23Na-tuned coil. The planning CT and the associated local radiation isodoses were deformably matched to the morphological MRI sequences with the software ""Velocity"" (Varian). Kidney regions exposed to radiation doses 5Gy, 20 Gy and 40Gy were identified and mean 23Na signal gradient along the cortico-medullary gradient and gradient slope were measured in these regions separately. Result(s): Mean relative 23Na signal of the cortico-medullary gradient and gradient slope matched with values of healthy volunteers in the pre-RT examination. All results are summarised in Table 1. In the first post-RT MRI, morphological sequences (T1 and T2w) did not show any changes. In kidney regions with doses below 20Gy, no changes in the 23Na-gradient slope were observed. For regions with doses of 40Gy and beyond, a functional result was observed that was different from the low dose regions: The slope of the 23Na cortico-medullary gradient in the high-dose regions was markedly reduced in the post-RT MRI when compared to the pre-RT MRI. (Table Presented) Average slope (in arbitrary units/pixel along the cortico-medullary axis) pre and post RT for different dose regions. A marked decrease in average slope is found for the 40Gy regions, whereas the slope of the cortico-medullary 23Na gradient remains high in areas receiving 20Gy or less. Conclusion(s): 2-6 weeks post RT, marked functional effects were observed in high-dose areas while no alteration in kidney function was observed in low dose areas (20Gy), indicating the value of functional MR imaging in the early assessment and characterisation of the chronological course of radiogenic nephrotoxicity.",Excluded,0.9240692
872,"Dramatic and prolonged decrease of whole salivary secretion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy Objectives. This study evaluates: (1) the change in whole salivary secretion rates of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients before, during, and after radiotherapy, especially during the first week of irradiation; (2) the recovery capability of salivary glands up to 2 years postirradiation; and (3) the possible prognostic factors affecting salivary gland functions. Study design. Fifty patients who completed conventional radiotherapy using either once-per-day or hyperfractionated technique were included. Both unstimulated and stimulated whole salivary flow rates and ratios (flow rate compared with baseline) were measured before, during, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years after radiotherapy. Multivariate analysis of potential prognostic factors affecting the salivary secretion ratio was made. Results. Salivary glands were very radiosensitive and responded to radiation very early. After 720 cGy at the fourth day of the 8-week treatment, the unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates had decreased by 40%-50%. The nadir was reached in many patients after 3600 cGy (4 weeks). A second phase of decrease in salivary secretion was noted after completion of radiotherapy. Conclusions. Different mechanisms may be responsible for salivary response after low and high dose of radiation. This study shows no recovery of salivary secretion during the follow-up period, and the best strategy for managing radiation-induced salivary gland damage may be reduction of radiation dose to the glands. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

259,"Irradiation induced inversions suppress recombination between the M locus and morphological markers in Aedes aegypti Background: Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of arthropod-borne viruses and one of the most widespread and invasive mosquito species. Due to the lack of efficient specific drugs or vaccination strategies, vector population control methods, such as the sterile insect technique, are receiving renewed interest. However, availability of a reliable genetic sexing strategy is crucial, since there is almost zero tolerance for accidentally released females. Development of genetic sexing strains through classical genetics is hindered by genetic recombination that is not suppressed in males as is the case in many Diptera. Isolation of naturally-occurring or irradiation-induced inversions can enhance the genetic stability of genetic sexing strains developed through genetically linking desirable phenotypes with the male determining region. Result(s): For the induction and isolation of inversions through irradiation, 200 male pupae of the 'BRA' wild type strain were irradiated at 30 Gy and 100 isomale lines were set up by crossing with homozygous 'red-eye' (re) mutant females. Recombination between re and the M locus and the white (w) gene (causing a recessive white eye phenotype when mutated) and the M locus was tested in 45 and 32 lines, respectively. One inversion (Inv35) reduced recombination between both re and the M locus, and wand the M locus, consistent with the presence of a rather extended inversion between the two morphological mutations, that includes the M locus. Another inversion (Inv5) reduced recombination only between w and the M locus. In search of naturally-occurring, recombination-suppressing inversions, homozygous females from the red eye and the white eye strains were crossed with seventeen and fourteen wild type strains collected worldwide, representing either recently colonized or long-established laboratory populations. Despite evidence of varying frequencies of recombination, no combination led to the elimination or substantial reduction of recombination. Conclusion(s): Inducing inversions through irradiation is a feasible strategy to isolate recombination suppressors either on the M or the m chromosome for Aedes aegypti. Such inversions can be incorporated in genetic sexing strains developed through classical genetics to enhance their genetic stability and support SIT or other approaches that aim to population suppression through male-delivered sterility.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded,0.9229376

874,"Optimum fractionation in X ray treatment of C3H mouse mammary tumours The doses required to control 50% of tumors at 150 days after irradiation were determined for eight fractionated X ray schedules. The tumors were first generation transplants from spontaneous mammary tumors in C3H/He mice. The schedules were: single doses, 5, 9 or 15 fractions given daily excluding weekends, and 2, 3, 5 or 9 fractions at the two day interval known to be optimal for reoxygenation in these tumors after a priming dose of 1,500 rads. For comparison, skin reactions on the feet of albino mice were determined, using the same fractionation schedules, in order to plot the tumor control probability (TCP) against skin reactions for corresponding schedules. Two optimum schedules were found which gave maximum local control of tumors for the lowest skin reaction: nine fractions in ten days (9F/10d) and 5F/9d. The treatments given in shorter overall times were fairly good if the two day intervals were used but were poor for 'daily' doses. Both schedules employing overall times of 18 days gave poor results. The results are discussed in relation to the time course of reoxygenation and cell proliferation. A substantial difference in TCD 50 was found between male and female mice, the females being easier to cure. (16 references.)",Excluded,0.91962975

Patients and Methods: Between 1998 and 2017, 170 patients treated with PORT for NSCLC were retrospectively reviewed. Lymphopenia was divided into tertiles with severe lymphopenia defined as absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) < 0.37 x 103/ul. Result(s): sRIL was observed in 32.3% of patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated sRIL was associated with planning target volume radiation fraction numbers (OR 1.09, p = 0.005) and total lung mean dose (OR 1.12, p = 0.006). With a median follow-up time of 12.2 years, the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 14.8 months and 28.4 months respectively in patients with sRIL, vs. 21.7 months (p = 0.008) and 48.3 months (p = 0.01) respectively in patients without sRIL. Multivariable analyses indicated sRIL significantly decreased OS (HR 1.95, p < 0.01). Since PORT for stage I-II NSCLC was done largely for positive margins, which may confound the contribution of severe RIL, we analyzed stage III separately and found that sRIL also significantly decreased OS (HR 1.88, p = 0.004) in multivariable analysis. Conclusion(s): For this long-term outcome study, severe RIL correlated with total lung mean dose and radiation fractionation numbers, and was a strong prognostic factor for poor survival in PORT patients, particularly in patients with stage III NSCLC, highlighting the importance of an intact immune system for post-radiation immunologic disease surveillance.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Excluded,0.9121295
1095,"Dose-dependent influence of genetic polymorphisms on DNA damage induced by styrene oxide, ethylene oxide and gamma-radiation Styrene oxide (SO), ethylene oxide (EO) and gamma-radiation (G) are agents with a well-described metabolism and genotoxicity. EPHX1 and GSTs play an important role in the detoxification of electrophiles and oxidative stress. Enzymes involved in base excision repair (hOGG1, XRCC1), in rejoining single strand breaks (XRCC1) and in repair of cross-links and chromosomal double strand breaks (XRCC3) might have an impact on genotoxicity as well. In this study we assessed the dose-dependent effect of genetic polymorphisms in biotransforming (EPHX (Tyr113/His113 and His139/Arg139), GSTP1 (Ile105/Val105), GSTM1 and GSTT1) and DNA repair enzymes (hOGG1 (Ser326/Cys326), XRCC1 (Arg194/Trp194, Arg280/His280, Arg399/Gln399), XRCC3 (Thr241/Met241)) on the induced genotoxicity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 20 individuals were exposed to 3 doses per agent (+control). Genotoxicity was evaluated by measuring comet tail length (TL) and micronucleus frequencies in binucleated cells (MNCB). Dose-dependent DNA damage was found for all agents and end-points, with the exception of MNCB induced by EO. Repeated measure ANOVA revealed a significant contribution of hOGG1 and XRCC3 genotypes to the inter-individual variability of TL and MNCB in cells exposed to EO and G. Homozygous hOGG1326 wild cells showed significantly lower EO-induced TL than the heterozygous cells. Significantly higher TL and MNCB were found in EO-exposed cells carrying the XRCC3(241)Met variant and the influence on TL was more pronounced at higher dose. In G-irradiated cells, TL was significantly higher in the hOGG1326 homozygous wild types compared with mutated genotypes. The influence of hOGG1326 on TL was borderline dose-dependent. We conclude that the influence of genetic polymorphisms of enzymes involved in DNA repair on induced genotoxicity depends on exposure dose.",Excluded,0.9109236
613,"Increased carotid wall thickening after radiotherapy on the neck Patients treated for head and neck tumours with local radiotherapy (RT) on the neck harbour an increased risk of stroke. This may be due to accelerated atherosclerotic changes within the RT-field; however, the real impact of local RT on the carotid artery remains debatable. The aim of the present study was to assess the difference in carotid wall thickness (intima-media thickness) in 42 unilaterally irradiated parotid tumour patients by performing B-mode ultrasonography. A mean difference in intima-media thickness (IMT) of the irradiated compared with the non-irradiated carotid artery of 0.30 mm (P=0.031) was found. A significant correlation was established with a longer post-RT interval (P=0.008). RT on the neck is associated with increased thickening of carotid IMT.

98,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor CIP2A indicates resistance to radiotherapy in rectal cancer Preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy, (C)RT, is an essential part of the treatment of rectal cancer patients, but tumor response to this therapy among patients is variable. Thus far, there are no clinical biomarkers that could be used to predict response to (C)RT or to stratify patients into different preoperative treatment groups according to their prognosis. Overexpression of cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) has been demonstrated in several cancers and is frequently associated with reduced survival. Recently, high CIP2A expression has also been indicated to contribute to radioresistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, but few studies have examined the connection between CIP2A and radiation response regarding other malignancies. We have evaluated CIP2A protein expression levels in relation to tumor regression after preoperative (C)RT and survival of rectal adenocarcinoma patients. The effects of CIP2A knockdown by siRNA on cell survival were further investigated in colorectal cancer cells exposed to radiation. Patients with low-CIP2A-expressing tumors had more frequently moderate or excellent response to long-course (C)RT than patients with high-CIP2A-expressing tumors. They also had higher 36-month disease-specific survival (DSS) rate in categorical analysis. In the multivariate analysis, low CIP2A expression level remained as an independent predictive factor for increased DSS. Suppression of CIP2A transcription by siRNA was found to sensitize colorectal cancer cells to irradiation and decrease their survival in vitro. In conclusion, these results suggest that by contributing to radiosensitivity of cancer cells, low CIP2A protein expression level associates with a favorable response to long-course (C)RT in rectal cancer patients.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

A finite element analysis of simulated eccentric forces using bone density data derived from CT Background and purpose: Radiotherapy is known to produce long-term skeletal complications. We aim to evaluate the biomechanical effect on femoral neck bone from hypothetical eccentric loads on pre- and post-radiotherapy CT-images for patients treated for rectal cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Pre- and post-radiotherapy CT-images of rectal cancer from 10 patients were selected randomly. The cortical and trabecular bone was segmented by hand. The biomechanical simulations of 4 eccentric loads and one load aligned with the femoral neck axis were completed using finite element analysis (FEA) in both pre- and post-patient models. Result(s): A comparative statistical study was completed of pre- and post-radiotherapy patient models of stress and displacement factors. Significant differences were found in eccentric loads in both factors. Natural load has a significant difference in stress, but no differences were found for displacements. The absolute difference in eccentric load applied to the anterior area location on the same patient implies from 5.3% to 40.5% of the stress yield values reported in previous studies. Conclusion(s): Loads applied to the anterior area of the femoral head must be considered in fracture simulations because the percentage of yield stress of pre- and post-irradiated bones shows a significant biomechanical change.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.9047071

Repeated administrations of 131I delivered the same dose each time, resulting in a cumulative dose from 1-3.5 Gy in the patients who had two to seven treatments. However, the estimated dose, based on the number of chromosomal aberrations on Day 4 and, above all, from the third treatment on, was considerably lower than the real dose absorbed by the lymphocytes. This may be linked to the phenomenon of apoptosis, which results in a loss of information during the course of repeated irradiation., CONCLUSION: Both chromosomal painting and conventional cytogenetics underestimate the cumulative dose after repeated 131I treatments. A complementary test measuring apoptosis may improve the dose estimates.",Excluded,0.90382075
677,"Dose, volume, and function relationships in parotid salivary glands following conformal and intensity-modulated irradiation of head and neck cancer PURPOSE: To determine the relationships between the three-dimensional dose distributions in parotid glands and their saliva production, and to find the doses and irradiated volumes that permit preservation of the salivary flow following irradiation (RT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-eight patients with head and neck cancer irradiated with parotid-sparing conformal and multisegmental intensity modulation techniques between March 1994 and August 1997 participated in the study. The mean dose and the partial volumes receiving specified doses were determined for each gland from dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Nonstimulated and stimulated saliva flow rates were selectively measured from each parotid gland before RT and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the completion of RT. The data were fit using a generalized linear model and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model of Lyman-Kutcher. In the latter model, a ""severe complication"" was defined as salivary flow rate reduced to < or =25% pre-RT flow at 12 months., RESULTS: Saliva flow rates data were available for 152 parotid glands. Glands receiving a mean dose below or equal to a threshold (24 Gy for the unstimulated and 26 Gy for the stimulated saliva) showed substantial preservation of the flow rates following RT and continued to improve over time (to median 76% and 114% of pre-RT for the unstimulated and stimulated flow rates, respectively, at 12 months). In contrast, most glands receiving a mean dose higher than the threshold produced little saliva with no recovery over time. The output was not found to decrease as mean dose increased, as long as the threshold dose was not reached. Similarly, partial volume thresholds were found: 67%, 45%, and 24% gland volumes receiving more than 15 Gy, 30 Gy, and 45 Gy, respectively. The partial volume thresholds correlated highly with the mean dose and did not add significantly to a model predicting the saliva flow rate from the mean dose and the time since RT. The NTCP model parameters were found to be TD50 (the tolerance dose for 50% complications rate for whole organ irradiated uniformly) = 28.4 Gy, n (volume dependence parameter) = 1, and m (the slope of the dose/response relationship) = 0.18. Clinical factors including age, gender, pre-RT surgery, chemotherapy, and certain medical conditions were not found to be significantly associated with the salivary flow rates. Medications (diuretics, antidepressants, and narcotics) were found to adversely affect the unstimulated but not the stimulated flow rates., CONCLUSIONS: Dose/volume/function relationships in the parotid glands are characterized by dose and volume thresholds, steep dose/response relationships when the thresholds are reached, and a maximal volume dependence parameter in the NTCP model. A parotid gland mean dose of < or =26 Gy should be a planning goal if substantial sparing of the gland function is desired.",Excluded,0.9021161

622,"Prognostic value of the micronucleus assay for clinical endpoints in neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy for rectal cancer BACKGROUND: The question whether lymphocyte radiosensitivity is representative of patients' response to radiotherapy (RT) remains unsolved. We analyzed lymphocyte cytogenetic damage in patients who were homogeneously treated with preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) for rectal cancer within clinical trials. We tested for interindividual variation and consistent radiosensitivity after in-vivo and in-vitro irradiation, analyzed the effect of patients' and RCT characteristics on cytogenetic damage, and tested for correlations with patients' outcome in terms of tumor response, survival and treatment-related toxicity., METHODS: The cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMNcyt) assay was performed on the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLCs) of 134 patients obtained before, during, at the end of RCT, and during the 2-year follow-up. A subset of PBLCs obtained before RCT was irradiated in-vitro with 3 Gy. RCT included 50.4 Gy of pelvic RT with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) alone (n = 78) or 5-FU plus oxaliplatin (n = 56). The analyzed variables included patients' age, gender, RT characteristics (planning target volume size [PTV size], RT technique), and chemotherapy characteristics (5-FU plasma levels, addition of oxaliplatin). Outcome was analyzed as tumor regression, patient survival, and acute and late toxicity., RESULTS: Cytogenetic damage increased significantly with the radiation dose and varied substantially between individuals. Women were more sensitive than men; no significant age-dependent differences were observed. There was a significant correlation between the cytogenetic damage after in-vitro irradiation and in-vivo RCT. We found a significant effect of the PTV size on the yields of cytogenetic damage after RCT, while the RT technique had no effect. Neither the addition of oxaliplatin nor the 5-FU levels influenced cytogenetic damage. We found no correlation between patient outcome and the cytogenetic damage., CONCLUSIONS: We found consistent cytogenetic damage in lymphocytes after in-vivo RCT and in-vitro irradiation. Gender was confirmed as a well-known, and the PTV size was identified as a less well-known influencing variable on lymphocyte cytogenetic damage after partial-body irradiation. A consistent level of cytogenetic damage after in-vivo and in-vitro irradiation may indicate the importance of genetic factors for individual radiosensitivity. However, we found no evidence that in-vivo or in-vitro irradiation-induced cytogenetic damage is an adequate biomarker for the response to RCT in rectal cancer patients.",Excluded,0.8962358
491,"Medical diagnostic radiation exposures and risk of gliomas High-dose ionizing radiation is an established risk factor for glioma, but it remains unknown whether moderate- and low-dose radiation increase glioma risk. In this analysis, we assessed the evidence that self-reported exposures to diagnostic ionizing radiation, including computerized tomography (CT) scans, is associated with increased risk of adult glioma. While no independent association was observed for CT scans alone (3+ scans compared to none P = 0.08 and 1-2 scans compared to none P = 0.68), our findings suggest an increased risk of adult gliomas with cumulative exposure to three or more CT scans to the head and neck region (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 0.92-4.23) limited to those who reported a family history of cancer: the P value for the interaction between having three or more CT scans and family history of cancer was 0.08. The stratum-specific adjusted OR for those with family history of cancer was more than three times that for the sub-group without family history of cancer. While there is some potential for symptom-related bias, one might expect this to be present for all diagnostic procedures rather than specific to one procedure. The interaction between CT scans and glioma with family history of cancer supports the biological plausibility of our findings, because similar results have been found for breast cancer and radiation.

At the end of study, 33 patients (42.3%) developed HT and the cumulative incidence of HT was 24.6%, 36.5% and 42.3% at one, two and three years, respectively. V30 of 42.1% (P=0.005) was defined as dose-volumetric threshold of radiation-induced HT in HNSCC patients.

IR+M group was i.p. injected with 10% magnesium sulfate (400 mg/kg) one day before radiation and three days and five days after radiation. And on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th day after radiation, SD rats were euthanatized to take brain tissue for the detection of calcium, redox status and cell apoptosis, as well as the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1., RESULTS: The results indicated that magnesium treatment may alleviate the elevation of calcium and enhance redox status through increasing the activities of superoxide dimutase (SOD) and myeloperodase (MPO), and decreasing the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). Tunnel and immunohistochemistry assay suggested that treatment with magnesium decreased the apoptosis rate of brain cells and the expressions of caspase-3, respectively. Decline of the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 protein was observed after the treatment of magnesium., CONCLUSION: All the results demonstrated that magnesium may elicit protective effect against radiationinduced brain injury by reducing calcium overload, improving redox and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Moreover, magnesium significantly down-regulated the protein or mRNA levels of NF-kappaB and ICAM- 1. The findings may provide references for the application of magnesium in clinic for brain injury induced by radiation.

671,"Cancer risk estimation of genotoxic chemicals based on target dose and a multiplicative model A mechanistic model and associated procedures are proposed for cancer risk assessment of genotoxic chemicals. As previously shown for ionizing radiation, a linear multiplicative model was found to be compatible with published experimental data for ethylene oxide, acrylamide, and butadiene. The validity of this model was anticipated in view of the multiplicative interaction of mutation with inherited and acquired growth-promoting conditions. Concurrent analysis led to rejection of an additive model (i.e. the model commonly applied for cancer risk assessment). A reanalysis of data for radiogenic cancer in mouse, dog and man shows that the relative risk coefficient is approximately the same (0.4 to 0.5 percent per rad) for tumours induced in the three species. Doses in vivo, defined as the time- integrated concentrations of ultimate mutagens, expressed in millimol x kg- 1 x h (mMh) are, like radiation doses given in Gy or rad, proportional to frequencies of potentially mutagenic events. The radiation dose equivalents of chemical doses are, calculated by multiplying chemical doses (in mMh) with the relative genotoxic potencies (in rad x mMh-1) determined in vitro. In this way the relative cancer incidence increments in rats and mice exposed to ethylene oxide were shown to be about 0.4 percent per rad-equivalent, in agreement with the data for radiogenic cancer. Our analyses suggest that values of the relative risk coefficients for genotoxic chemicals are independent of species and that relative cancer risks determined in animal tests apply also to humans. If reliable animal test data are not available, cancer risks may be estimated by the relative potency. In both cases exposure dose/target dose relationships, the latter via macromolecule adducts, should be determined.",Excluded,0.8845636
296,"Preclinical evaluation of pions in vivo: experience at TRIUMF This paper describes the results obtained from in vivo studies of the pion beam at the TRI University Meson Facility (TRIUMF). The studies encompass work (from 1978 to 1986), designed to evaluate the RBE for early and late effects and to assess the importance of X-ray dose rate and treatment volume on these values. Results with early responding tissues, i.e. mouse and pig skin and mouse intestine indicate a pion RBE of about 1.5 in the clinically relevant dose per fraction range of 2-3 Gy. At these doses, RBE appears to be independent of the reference X-ray dose rate. However, at high doses per fraction, the RBE values become increasingly X-ray dose rate dependent. The induction of late effects by pions has been assessed by monitoring the late dermal response of pig skin; late fibrosis was not assessed in this study. The values obtained using the chosen endpoint indicate that the RBE is not significantly higher than that seen in any of the early responding tissues for pion doses as low as 2-3 Gy per fraction. The effect of increasing the treatment volume for pion therapy has been assessed using mouse intestine. The results show that for a constant field size, RBE decreases with increasing peak width. However, if peak width is held constant and field size increased, there is evidence for an increased RBE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded,0.88425434

To identify complications associated with tumor-related lipid exudation (TRLE) after plaque radiotherapy of posterior uveal melanoma. Methods. Comparative study including 294 patients with posterior uveal melanoma who developed TRLE after plaque radiotherapy (TRLE group) and 294 patients who did not develop TRLE (non-TRLE group). Patients in the TRLE group were matched with patients in the non-TRLE group for age, gender, and initial tumor thickness. results. The TRLE group was associated with significantly higher incidence of postradiation complications including early transient increase of serous retinal detachment (p<0.001), iris neovascularization (NVI) (p<0.001), neovascular glaucoma (NVG) (p<0.001), posterior synechia (p<0.001), vitreous hemorrhage (p<0.001), subretinal hemorrhage (p<0.001), and retinoschisis (p<0.001). A significant relationship was found between extent of TRLE and NVI (p<0.001), NVG (p<0.001), posterior synechia (p = 0.007), and retinoschisis over tumor (p = 0.010). Radiation-induced retinopathy, maculopathy, and papillopathy were not associated with presence or extent of TRLE. Tumor-related lipid exudation was also associated with worse final visual acuity (p = 0.011), higher rate of secondary enucleation (p<0.001), and lower rate of systemic metastasis (p = 0.006). Conclusions. Tumor-related lipid exudation following plaque radiotherapy of posterior uveal melanoma is associated with major intraocular complications and portends poor prognosis for final visual acuity and eye retention. These findings provide evidence for the presence of 2 distinct pathogenic mechanisms, one radiation-induced and one tumor-related, in development of postradiation complications in eyes with posterior uveal melanoma. © 2013 Wichtig Editore.",Excluded,0.88174325
396,"Regional radiation dose susceptibility within the parotid gland: Effects on salivary loss and recovery Purpose: Xerostomia is one of the most likely late toxic effects of radiotherapy treatment in patients with head-and-neck cancers. Modern treatment techniques can incorporate knowledge of complication risk into treatment plans. To this end, the authors attempt to quantify the regional radiotherapy dose-dependence of salivary output loss and recovery in a prospective study. Method(s): Salivary output was collected from patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment for headand- neck cancers at the BC Cancer Agency between February 2008 and May 2013. Regional dose-dependence (i.e., dose susceptibility) of loss and recovery is quantified using nonparametric (Spearmans rank correlation coefficients, local linear regression) and parametric (least-sum of squares, least-median of squares) techniques. Result(s): Salivary flow recovery was seen in 79 of 102 patients considered (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon sign rank test). Output loss was strongly correlated with left- and right parotid combined dose phi = min (DL, 45 Gy)+min (DR, 45 Gy), and can be accurately predicted. Median early loss (three months) was 72% of baseline, while median overall loss (1 yr) was 56% of baseline. Fitting an exponential model to whole parotid yields dose sensitivities A3m = 0.0604 Gy?1 and A1y = 0.0379 Gy?1. Recovery was not significantly associated with dose. Hints of lateral organ subsegment doseresponse dimorphism were observed. Conclusion(s): Sub-segmentation appears to predict neither loss nor recovery with any greater precision than whole parotid mean dose, though it is not any worse. Sparing the parotid to a combined dose phi of <50 Gy is recommended for a patient to keep =40% of baseline function and thus avoid severe xerostomia at 12 months post-treatment. It seems unlikely that a populations mean recovery will exceed 20%30% of baseline output at 1 yr after radiotherapy treatment using current (whole-organ based) clinical guidelines.Copyright © 2015 Am.

159,"UCP-3 uncoupling protein confers hypoxia resistance to renal epithelial cells and is upregulated in renal cell carcinoma Tumor cells can adapt to a hostile environment with reduced oxygen supply. The present study aimed to identify mechanisms that confer hypoxia resistance. Partially hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-resistant proximal tubular (PT) cells were selected by exposing PT cultures to repetitive cycles of H/R. Thereafter, H/R-induced changes in mRNA and protein expression, inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DELTAPSI(m)), formation of superoxide, and cell death were compared between H/R-adapted and control PT cultures. As a result, H/R-adapted PT cells exhibited lower H/R-induced hyperpolarization of DELTAPSI(m) and produced less superoxide than the control cultures. Consequently, H/R triggered DELTAPSI(m) break-down and DNA degradation in a lower percentage of H/R-adapted than control PT cells. Moreover, H/R induced upregulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3) in H/R-adapted PT but not in control cultures. In addition, ionizing radiation killed a lower percentage of H/R-adapted as compared to control cells suggestive of an H/R-radiation cross-resistance developed by the selection procedure. Knockdown of UCP-3 decreased H/R- and radioresitance of the H/R-adapted cells. Finally, UCP-3 protein abundance of PT-derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma and normal renal tissue was compared in human specimens indicating upregulation of UCP-3 during tumor development. Combined, our data suggest functional significance of UCP-3 for H/R resistance.",Excluded,0.8801107

1134,"Long-term survival and symptom palliation in small primary bronchial carcinomas following treatment with intraluminal radiotherapy alone Between April 1988 and December 1992, 37 patients with small, previously unirradiated, primary non-small cell carcinomas of the bronchus causing symptoms due to endobronchial disease were treated at the Christie Hospital, Manchester, with a single fraction of high dose rate intraluminal radiotherapy (ILT) using the microSelectron-HDR machine. Small primary (SP) lesions were defined as being less than 2 cm in diameter in a direction perpendicular to the central axis of the iridium-192 treatment source. Fifteen patients (41%) were treated to a dose of 15 Gy and 22 patients (59%) to 20 Gy at a distance of 1 cm from the central axis of the source. At 6 weeks following ILT, improvement in symptoms was seen in the following percentages of patients: haemoptysis 96%, pulmonary collapse 69%, cough 55% and dyspnoea 52%. The magnitude of improvement in these symptoms was largely maintained in patients surviving to 4 months and then 12 months post-ILT. Median actuarial survival was 709 days, 2-year survival 49.4% and 5-year survival 14.1%. Overall, there was no significant difference in survival after treatment with 20 Gy compared with 15 Gy at 1 cm. At the close of study, there were four patients still alive without disease recurrence with survivals of 38, 48, 49 and 63 months. All had had biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinomas and all had been treated with 20 Gy at 1 cm. Five patients died from massive haemoptysis as a terminal event at 4, 9, 9, 10 and 11 months post-ILT, well below the median survival for this group of patients. Again, all had been treated with 20 Gy as opposed to 15 Gy at 1 cm. Over the same time period, 287 patients with non-small cell carcinomas of more than 2 cm in diameter (large primary lesions, LP), were treated with a single fraction of ILT only, as their initial treatment. A consistently greater percentage of patients with SP lesions showed an improvement in the symptoms of haemoptysis and pulmonary collapse when compared with patients with LP lesions. Patients with LP lesions demonstrated a decreased actuarial survival when compared with SP lesions, with median survival being 156 days, 2-year survival 3.1% and no survivors beyond 39 months. This study demonstrates that, in patients with small endobronchial carcinomas a single fraction of ILT can give efficient palliation of symptoms and lead to long term disease-free survival, but that a dose of 20 Gy may be at the limit of bronchial radiation tolerance for a single dose technique employing a high dose rate source.",Excluded,0.86424017
148,"Evidence for variation in human radiosensitivity and its potential impact on radiological protection Radiological protection standards generally assume that all members of the population are equally sensitive to the adverse health effects associated with radiation exposure, recognising the age- and sex-related differences in sensitivity to radiation-induced cancer. It has become very clear over recent years that genetic and lifestyle factors can play important roles in the susceptibility of individuals to a range of diseases; as such, the same may apply to radiation-associated diseases. Evidence is accumulating from studies at many levels of biological organisation - cells, experimental organisms, and humans - that a range of radiosensitivity exists between individuals in the population. Consideration of improvements in radiological protection practices to take account of such differences will require the availability of robust and accurate ways to assess the sensitivity of an individual or population subgroup. In addition, there will need to be careful consideration of the ethical aspects relating to use of individual sensitivity information. These ethical considerations are very likely to be exposure context dependent, and require careful risk-benefit balance consideration before practical application.

In this paper we tested the efficacy of four common NTCP models applied quantitatively to sub-clinical X-ray computed tomography (CT)-density changes in the lung following radiotherapy. Radiotherapy planning datasets and follow-up chest CTs were obtained in eight patients treated for targets within the lung or hilar region. Image pixel-wise radiation dose exposure versus change in observable CT Hounsfield units was recorded for early (2-5 months) and late (6-9 months) time-points. Four NTCP models, Lyman, Logistic, Weibull and Poisson, were fit to the population data. The quality of fits was assessed by five statistical criteria. All four models fit the data significantly (p<0.05) well at early, late and cumulative time points. The Lyman model fitted best for early effects while the Weibull Model fitted best for late effects. No significant difference was found between the fits of the models and with respect to parameters D50 and gamma50. The D50 estimates were more robust than gamma50 to image registration error.

This takes place under the conditions of surface therapy in single doses of 1.5 Gray two or three times per week up to a total dose of 9 to 12 Gray. Good cosmetic and functional results can be achieved with this technique. The rate of recurrences is extremely low. The radiation load to the patient is so small that it seems justifiable to recommend the combined treatment as the routine method for therapy of keloids.

Diagnostics, prophylaxis and correction of this condition demand new accurate and objective approaches. Here we report on an in vivo longitudinal monitoring of the oral mucosa dynamics in 25 patients during the course of radiotherapy of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal cancer using multifunctional optical coherence tomography (OCT). A spectral domain OCT system with a specially-designed oral imaging probe was used. Microvasculature visualization was based on temporal speckle variations of the full complex signal evaluated by high-pass filtering of 3D data along the slow scan axis. Angiographic image quantification demonstrated an increase of the vascular density and total length of capillary-like-vessels before visual signs or clinical symptoms of mucositis occur. Especially significant microvascular changes compared to their initial levels occurred when grade two and three mucositis developed. Further, microvascular reaction was seen to be dose-level dependent.

Patients and Methods: A total of 222 prospectively analyzed patients with various HN malignancies were treated with conventional and intensity-modulated RT. Stimulated individual parotid gland flow rates were measured before RT and 1 year after RT using Lashley cups at both centers. A flow ratio <25% of pretreatment was defined as a complication.

Review methods Patients: Tumor database patients with American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Class A or B hearing at the onset of study. Stereotactic radiotherapy patients were predominantly those who failed conservative management. Intervention(s): Audiometric pure tone averages and speech discrimination scores as well as patient demographics, tumor location, size and growth were extracted. Main Outcome Measure(s): Hearing outcome measures were: 1) Hearing Preservation, i.e. no drop from Class A/B to Class C/D hearing, 2) Hearing Survival of Class A/B hearing in months, 3) Audiometric Pure Tone Averages, Difference between post-treatment and pre-treatment, and 4) Speech Discrimination Score Difference (pre-treatment - post treatment). Survival analysis and non-parametric tests were used for hearing outcome measures, with multiple covariates tested. Results Overall, serviceable hearing preservation among the 123 patients was 51%. The median hearing survival time was 46 months (mean 59 months). The Pure Tone averages and Speech Discrimination score differences were 16 dB and 82% respectively over a median follow-up time of 43 months. No significant difference was found between the conservative and SRT groups in any hearing outcome. Class A patients showed far better hearing survival than Class B patients. Conclusions No significant difference was demonstrated as to measures of hearing outcomes between stereotactic radiotherapy and conservative management. Excellent existing hearing appears to be the best predictor of long term hearing survival in the cohort studied.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.83198637

The need for repeat PCI has been significantly reduced in patients since the advent of vascular brachytherapy. In-stent restenosis resulting in bifurcation presents even more of a challenge. The use of radiation therapy for the treatment of this kind of lesion has not yet been reported. The purpose of this paper is to present five cases of radiation therapy in bifurcation in-stent restenotic lesions using the intraluminal beta radiation catheter delivery system (Beta-Cath System, Novoste Corporation, Norcross, Georgia)., METHODS: We reviewed the database of patients enrolled in our Compassionate Use Registry between August 1999 and April 2002.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, is overexpressed in a variety of tumors, including CD133+ glioblastomas. The COX-2-derived prostaglandins promote neovascularization during tumor development, and conventional radiotherapy increases the proportion of CD133+ cells rather than eradicating them. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in enhancing the therapeutic effects of radiation on CD133+ glioblastomas. Methods. Cells positive for CD133 were isolated from glioblastoma specimens and characterized by flow cytometry, then treated with celecoxib and/or ionizing radiation (IR). Clonogenic assay, cell irradiation, cell cycle analysis, Western blot, and xenotransplantation were used to assess the effects of celecoxib alone, IR alone, and IR with celecoxib on CD133+ and CD133- glioblastoma cells. Three separate xenotransplantation experiments were carried out using 310 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice: 1) an initial tumorigenicity evaluation in which 3 different quantities of untreated CD133- cells or untreated or pretreated CD133+ cells (5 treatment conditions) from 7 different tumors were injected into the striatum of 2 mice (210 mice total); 2) a tumor growth study (50 mice); and 3) a survival study (50 mice). For these last 2 studies the same 5 categories of cells were used as in the tumorigenicity (untreated CD133 - cells, untreated or pretreated CD133+ cells, with pretreatment consisting of celecoxib alone, IR alone, or IR and celecoxib), but only 1 cell source (Case 2) and quantity (5 x 104 cells) were used. Results. High levels of COX-2 protein were detected in the CD133 + but not the CD133- glioblastoma cells. The authors further demonstrated that 30 mM celecoxib was able to effectively enhance the IR effect in inhibiting colony formation and increasing IR-mediated apoptosis in celecoxib-treated CD133+ glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, reduction in radioresistance was correlated with the induction of G2/M arrest, which was partially mediated through the increase in the level of phosphorylated-cdc2. In vivo xenotransplant analysis further confirmed that CD133+-associated tumorigenicity was significantly suppressed by celecoxib treatment. Importantly, pretreatment of CD133+ glioblastoma cells with a combination of celecoxib and IR before injection into the striatum of SCID mice resulted in a statistically significant reduction in tumor growth and a statistically significant increase in the mean survival rate of the mice. Conclusions. Celecoxib combined with radiation plays a critical role in the suppression of growth of CD133+ glioblastoma stemlike cells. Celecoxib is therefore a radiosensitizing drug for clinical application in glioblastoma.",Excluded,0.81662315

This method is preferred in patients with small, benign nodules. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of radioiodine therapy on thyroid size in patients with a solitary toxic thyroid nodule. 22 patients with single nodule in USG and confirmed ""hot"" nodule in scintigraphy were enrolled in the study. Thyroid and nodule volume were determined by ultrasound before, 3 and 6 months after the administration of 131I. Thyroid function was assessed by TSH level prior to the treatment and 6 weeks after the therapy. Thyroid volume and nodule size decreased significantly within 3 and 6 months after 131I treatment. The mean reduction of thyroid volume within 6 month after treatment was 32%. Reduction in thyroid volume and nodule, size was significantly greater within first 3 months than within next 3 months. Patients with smaller nodules (less than 70% of thyroid volume) were characterized by greater reduction of goiter size than patients with nodules bigger or equal to 70% of thyroid volume.",Excluded,0.8104249

Background(s): Rate of progression of XRT-associated moderate AS and its impact on outcomes is not well-described. Method(s): We included 81 patients (age 61 +/- 13 years; 57% female) with at least XRT-associated moderate AS (aortic valve area [AVA] 1.05 +/- 0.3 cm2; mean gradient 24 +/- 10 mm Hg) who had >=2 transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) 1 year apart and matched them in a 1:2 fashion on the basis of age, sex, and AVA with those without prior XRT. Serial aortic valve gradients and AVA were recorded. AVR and longer-term all-cause mortality during follow-up were recorded. Result(s): A total of 100% of patients had 1, a total of 71% had 2, and 39% had 3 follow-up TTEs. Before AVR, mean AVG and AVA were not significantly different between XRT and comparison groups. At 3.6 +/- 2.0 years from baseline TTE, 146 (60%) underwent AVR (16% transcatheter), with significantly more patients in the XRT group undergoing AVR (80% vs. 50%; p < 0.01), at a much shorter time (2.9 +/- 1.6 years vs. 4.1 +/- 2.4 years; p < 0.01). At 6.6 +/- 4.0 years from the initial TTE, 49 (20%) patients died, with a significantly higher mortality in the XRT group (40% vs. 11%; p < 0.01), with prior XRT associated with increased longer-term mortality, whereas AVR was associated with improved longer-term survival. Conclusion(s): In patients with moderate AS, those with prior XRT have a similar rate of progression of AS versus a comparison group. A higher proportion of patients in the XRT group were referred for AVR at a shorter time from baseline TTE. Despite that, the XRT patients had significantly higher longer-term mortality, and prior exposure to XRT was associated with significantly increased longer-term mortality.Copyright © 2018 American College of Cardiology Foundation",Excluded,0.80372614
332,"Radiosensitizing effects of miR-18a-5p on lung cancer stem-like cells via downregulating both ATM and HIF-1alpha Lung cancer is one of the main causes of cancer mortality globally. Most patients received radiotherapy during the course of disease. However, radioresistance generally occurs in the majority of these patients, leading to poor curative effect, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, miR-18a-5p expression was downregulated in irradiated lung cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-18a-5p increased the radiosensitivity of lung cancer cells and inhibited the growth of A549 xenografts after radiation exposure. Dual luciferase report system and miR-18a-5p overexpression identified ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) as the targets of miR-18a-5p. The mRNA and protein expressions of ATM and HIF-1alpha were dramatically downregulated by miR-18a-5p in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, plasma miR-18a-5p expression was significantly higher in radiosensitive than in radioresistant group (P < .001). The cutoff value of miR-18a-5p >2.28 was obtained from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The objective response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in miR-18a-5p-high group than in miR-18a-5p-low group (P < .001). A tendency demonstrated that the median local progression-free survival (PFS) from radiotherapy was longer in miR-18a-5p-high than in miR-18a-5p-low group (P = .082). The median overall survival (OS) from radiotherapy was numerically longer in miR-18a-5p-high than in miR-18a-5p-low group (P = .281). The sensitivity and specificity of plasma miR-18a-5p to predict radiosensitivity was 87% and 95%, respectively. Collectively, these results indicate that miR-18a-5p increases the radiosensitivity in lung cancer cells and CD133+ stem-like cells via downregulating ATM and HIF-1alpha expressions. Plasma miR-18a-5p would be an available indicator of radiosensitivity in lung cancer patients. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded,0.8003279
967,"Postoperative radiotherapy-induced morbidity in rectal cancer OBJECTIVES: We analyzed long-term morbidity and bowel function alteration after postoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer following resection with anastomosis., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients who underwent surgery with intention to cure and a minimal follow-up period of 3 years were included. These patients were divided into two groups: in the first group, 14 patients received postoperative chemo-radiotherapy, 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid, and 45 Gy plus 5 Gy boost. In the second group, there were 23 patients regarded as controls. We designed a questionnaire about their bowel function and analyzed the morbidity detected in their follow-up., RESULTS: The group that was treated with postoperative chemo-radiotherapy had more daily bowel movements (p = 0.03) and night-time movements (p = 0.04); incontinence (69.2 vs. 17.4% in the control group; p = 0.002), and perianal skin irritation (p = 0.04) versus the control group. Although without meaningful differences, the group under treatment wore a pad more often, had more defecatory urgency, could distinguish worse gas from stool, and needed more frequently antidiarrheal measures. Major complications were present in 28.6% of the under-treatment group: three intestinal resections were performed due to actinic stenosis; one patient had a residual stercoral fistula; another had several occlusive crises solved with medical treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative chemo-radiotherapy had a high morbidity rate, which determined a significant alteration in quality of life. Accuracy in indication is therefore necessary, as well as a consideration of other alternatives for treatment, such as preoperative chemo-radiotherapy and total mesorectal excision.",Excluded,0.7950248
1218,"Influence of nerve radiation dose in the incidence of trigeminal dysfunction after trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery OBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a comparative study to analyze dosimetry and results to understand the significant difference in the rate of trigeminal dysfunction after gamma knife radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia between two centers using the same target., METHODS: The data of 358 patients (109 patients from Brussels and 259 patients from Marseilles) were analyzed. Three different dosimetric strategies were found: treatment with less than 90 Gy and no selective beam channel blocking (Group 1; patients from Marseilles only), treatment with 90 Gy and no selective beam channel blocking (Group 2; patients from Brussels and Marseilles), or treatment with 90 Gy and use of selective beam channel blocking (Group 3; patients from Brussels only)., RESULTS: The prescription dose and the use of selective beam channel blocking have been significantly associated with a higher energy received by the retrogasserian trigeminal nerve root. The different radiation dose delivered to the nerve root in these three groups of patients was significantly associated with the incidence of mild (15, 21, and 49% for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and bothersome (1.4, 2.4, and 10% for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) trigeminal dysfunction. The good and excellent rates of pain relief were 81 and 66%, respectively, for Group 1, 85 and 77%, respectively, for Group 2, and 90 and 84%, respectively, for Group 3, and were also related to the amount of energy received by nerve root volume., CONCLUSION: Using a similar target, the incidence of trigeminal dysfunction and the pain relief rate can vary according to the radiation energy received by the retrogasserian part of the trigeminal nerve root. The prescription dose and the use of beam channel blocking modify the integrated dose delivered to the nerve and may contribute to the different rates of trigeminal numbness and pain outcome. The radiobiological effect of gamma knife radiosurgery may be related to the energy delivered to nerve root volume, rather than to the maximal dose delivered.",Excluded,0.7949756

768,"Decreased asbestos-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis after radiation and bone marrow transplant The effect of lung irradiation on subsequent inflammatory or fibrotic lung injuries remains poorly understood. We postulated that irradiation and bone marrow transplantation might impact the development and progression of lung remodeling resulting from asbestos inhalation. Our objective was to determine whether irradiation and bone marrow transplantation affected inflammation and fibrosis associated with inhaled asbestos exposure. Inflammation, cytokine production, and fibrosis were assessed in lungs of naive and sex-mismatched chimeric mice exposed to asbestos for 3, 9, or 40 days. Potential engraftment of donor-derived cells in recipient lungs was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Compared with asbestos-exposed naive (nonchimeric) mice, chimeric mice exposed to asbestos for 3, 9, or 40 days demonstrated significant abrogation of acute increases in asbestos-associated inflammatory mediators and fibrosis. Donor-derived cells trafficked to lung but did not significantly engraft as phenotypic lung cells. Irradiation and bone marrow transplantation alters inflammatory and fibrotic responses to asbestos, likely through modulation of soluble inflammatory mediators.",Excluded,0.79234326
322,"Radiation-induced oscillopsia in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients PURPOSE: To apply a battery of audiovestibular function tests and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the causes of oscillopsia in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients after irradiation (RT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Of 300 NPC patients, 12 (4%) developed oscillopsia after RT. The mean accumulated radiation dose to the nasopharynx was 112 +/- 30 Gy. Each patient underwent a battery of audiovestibular function tests, including audiometry and the dynamic illegible E, caloric, and rotational tests., RESULTS: Excluding 3 patients with neck fibrosis who could not perform the head turning movement, the remaining 9 patients displayed 100% abnormal dynamic illegible E test results and 100% abnormal refixation saccades. All 12 patients presented with bilateral hearing loss, caloric reductions, and reduced gains of the vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) on the rotational test, indicating bilateral VOR loss. After excluding tumor relapse and radiation necrosis of the brain by MRI, the oscillopsia in these 12 irradiated NPC patients was attributed to bilateral VOR loss., CONCLUSION: Radiation-induced oscillopsia in our NPC patients was attributed to bilateral VOR loss, possibly as a result of higher radiation doses. Hence, the therapeutic benefits of a second course of RT are associated with the potential risk of oscillopsia after RT.",Excluded,0.79146445

The length of visual retention was most dependent on tumour thickness, tumour location with respect to the optic nerve, fovea, or ciliary body, and patient age. In addition to these factors, the retention of 6/12 visual acuity and the time to 6/120 visual acuity were dependent on the preoperative visual acuity. The risk of visual loss was greatest immediately after treatment and decreased with time. The 5 year actuarial metastatic rate was approximately 13%. Patients at the greatest risk of post-radiation visual loss had significantly greater risk of tumour related mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Some patients who would have been eligible for randomisation to either enucleation or radioactive plaque therapy can be irradiated with retention of excellent vision.",Excluded,0.7857907
816,"Clinical outcomes of graves' ophthalmopathy treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy BACKGROUND: Radiation for Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) has traditionally utilized lateral opposing fields (LOF) or three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) technique. The current study was conducted to report clinical outcomes and therapeutic effects of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in treating GO patients., METHODS: One hundred sixteen patients with GO were treated with IMRT as initial local therapy between July 2010 and August 2013, with a median follow-up of 62 months (range 45-81 months). Radiotherapy dose was 20 Gy in 10 fractions within two to three weeks. The immediate and long-term response to IMRT was evaluated in GO severity score and in each category of symptoms. Acute and long-term complications were recorded to assess its safety., RESULTS: Symptom severity score significantly fell from the start of treatment to 4- or 6- month post-IMRT (P < 0.01). In total, 85 patients (73.3%) experienced improvement of GO symptoms in the first half-year, and only 4 of them (4.7%) suffered recurrence of the GO symptoms during the subsequent follow-ups. Orbital pain, tearing and extraocular muscle dysfunction had the best treatment reaction to IMRT, while proptosis and blurred vision were the most refractory symptoms. Acute complications were slight and self-limited, mainly including intermittent eye redness in 9 patients (7.8%), sideburns hair loss in 19 patients (16.4%), increased milphosis or madarosis in 23 patients (19.8%) and pseudo-progression of GO symptoms in 15 patients (12.9%). For long-term complications, chronic xerophthalmias occurred in 7 patients (6.03%), cataract developed in 2 patients (1.72%), and all were well-managed by medical interventions. Radiation retinopathy and secondary malignancy was not presented in the cohort., CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that IMRT could serve as a viable option in treating GO patients, with a satisfactory symptom control ability, and relatively slight and acceptable post-radiotherapeutic complications.",Excluded,0.7838887

632,"The treatment of movement disorders using gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery GK radiosurgical thalamotomy is an effective and useful alternative to invasive radiofrequency techniques for patients at high surgical risk. The mechanical accuracy of the gamma unit combined with the anatomical accuracy of high-resolution MR imaging makes radiosurgical lesioning safe and precise. Higher radiosurgical doses are more effective than lower ones at eliminating or reducing tremor and are without complications. The results from radiosurgical pallidotomy have been disappointing compared to those of gamma thalamotomy. A 50% complication rate in the former (homonymous field cuts, hemipareses, and dysphagias) combined with a poor success rate has led us to re-evaluate the indications for this procedure in the face of the excellent results obtained from radiofrequency pallidotomy with physiological monitoring. Perhaps lowered radiosurgical prescription doses can improve the complication rate. Anatomically, there appears to be a different sensitivity of the pallidum to radiation than that of the thalamus. Age-related or anatomy-related susceptible blood supply to the area may lead to hypoxia after single-fraction radiosurgery in a nuclear complex known to be especially susceptible to hypoxia. In addition, varying levels of iron deposition within the pallidum may catalyze free radical formation in the elderly only to be further exacerbated by tissue hypoxia. Future experience with radiosurgical treatment of essential tremor, dystonias, and other movement disorders should parallel that of radiofrequency techniques.",Excluded,0.7616845
17,"Late radiation-associated dysphagia (late-RAD) with lower cranial neuropathy after oropharyngeal radiotherapy: A preliminary dosimetric comparison Background and objectives Late radiation-associated dysphagia (late-RAD) is a rare delayed toxicity, in oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) survivors. Prevention of late-RAD is paramount because the functional impairment can be profound and refractory to standard therapies. The objective of this analysis is to identify candidate dosimetric predictors of late-RAD and associated lower cranial neuropathies after radiotherapy (RT) or chemo-RT (CRT) for OPC. Materials and methods An unmatched retrospective case-control analysis was conducted. Late-RAD cases were identified among OPC patients treated with definitive RT or CRT. Controls were selected with minimum of 6 years without symptoms of late-RAD. Dysphagia-aspiration related structures (DARS) and regions of interest containing cranial nerve paths (RCCNPs) were retrospectively contoured. Dose volume histograms were calculated. Non-parametric bivariate associations were analyzed with Bonferroni correction and multiple logistic regression models were fit. Results Thirty-eight patients were included (12 late-RAD cases, 26 controls). Median latency to late-RAD was 5.8 years (range: 4.5-11.3 years). Lower cranial neuropathies were present in 10 of 12 late-RAD cases. Mean superior pharyngeal constrictor (SPC) dose was higher in cases relative to controls (median: 70.5 vs. 61.6 Gy). Mean SPC dose significantly predicted late-RAD (p = 0.036) and related cranial neuropathies (p = 0.019). RCCNPs did not significantly predict late-RAD or cranial neuropathies. Conclusions SPC dose may predict for late-RAD and related lower cranial neuropathies. These data, and those of previous studies that have associated SPC dose with classical dysphagia endpoints, suggest impetus to constrain dose to the SPCs when possible. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Material(s) and Method(s): 131 patients were treated with SCRT (5 Gy/5 days), followed by surgery 3-53 days later. Break was calculated as the time interval between the end of irradiation to surgery and OTT as time interval from the beginning of RT to surgery. Result(s): Mean break was 21.5 (range 3-53.0) days and mean OTT was 26.5 (range 7-58.0) days. In univariate analysis, a break longer than 15 days and OTT >23 days were negative prognostic factors for OS for all patients, and particularly for the male patients' subgroup. RFS was non-significantly higher (P = 0.066) for patients treated with a break <=15 days and OTT <=23 days (P = 0.099), irrespectively of patients' sex. Patients treated with a break longer than 15 days and OTT >23 days had non-significantly lower level of MFS than those treated with a shorter break (P = 0.269) and OTT <=23 days (P = 0.498).

327,"BMI1-KLF4 axis deficiency improves responses to neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer Purpose: Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is a gold standard treatment for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI1) is a member of the polycomb group of proteins that are involved in regulating gene expression. High levels of BMI1 have been demonstrated to contribute to the malignant phenotypes of several cancers; however, its relevance in rectal cancer treated with CCRT is largely unknown. Methods and materials: We used two patient cohorts to address the clinical relevance of BMI1 in human cancers. In addition, HT-29 and HCT-116 cells were chosen as our in vitro models to verify the role of BMI1 in cell response to ionizing radiation. Stemness-related proteins were analyzed by western blotting and cell survival was determined using clonogenic assays. Result(s): BMI1 overexpression was found to significantly correlate with advanced pre-treatment nodal status (N1-N2; p < 0.001), post-treatment tumor stage (T1-T2; p = 0.015), inferior tumor regression grade (p = 0.001), and also an independent prognosis factor in 172 rectal cancer patients receiving CCRT. Serial cell-based functional examination indicated that BMI1 deficiency sensitized cells to radiation treatment by modulating the gene expression of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and enhanced radiosensitivity in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancers. Overexpression of KLF4 partially overcame BMI1-deficiency-mediated gamma-H2AX expression after ionizing radiation exposure. Consistent with in vitro data, an analysis of an additional 30 rectal cancer tissue specimens revealed a positive correlation between BMI1 and KLF4 (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Higher levels of BMI1 are associated with poor therapeutic response and adverse outcomes in rectal cancer patients receiving CCRT.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.7457843

Purpose Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors are at an increased risk of stroke because of carotid artery irradiation. However, for early-stage HL involved node radiation therapy (INRT) reduces the volume of normal tissue exposed to high doses. Here, we evaluate 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and proton therapy (PT) delivered as INRT along with the extensive mantle field (MF) by comparing doses to the carotid arteries and corresponding risk estimates. Methods and Materials We included a cohort of 46 supradiaphragmatic stage I-II classical HL patients. All patients were initially treated with chemotherapy and INRT delivered as 3D-CRT (30 Gy). For each patient, we simulated MF (36 Gy) and INRT plans using VMAT and PT (30 Gy). Linear dose-response curves for the 20-, 25-, and 30-year risk of stroke were derived from published HL data. Risks of stroke with each technique were calculated for all patients. Statistical analyses were performed with repeated measures analysis of variance. Results The mean doses to the right and left common carotid artery were significantly lower with modern treatment compared with MF, with substantial patient variability. The estimated excess risk of stroke after 20, 25, and 30 years was 0.6%, 0.86%, and 1.3% for 3D-CRT; 0.67%, 0.96%, and 1.47% for VMAT; 0.61%, 0.96%, and 1.33% for PT; and 1.3%, 1.72%, and 2.61% for MF. Conclusions INRT reduces the dose delivered to the carotid arteries and corresponding estimated risk of stroke for HL survivors. Even for the subset of patients with lymphoma close to the carotid arteries, the estimated risk is low. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.74347216

Methods and Materials: From 2011 to 2013, 105 patients after esophagectomy were treated with postoperative radiotherapy. The intrathoracic stomach was outlined with the calculation of a dose-volume histogram (DVH) for the initial intended treatment of 6020 cGy or 6300 cGy. The volume of the intrathoracic stomach receiving each dose was recorded at 10-Gy intervals between 10 and 40 Gy and at 5-Gy intervals between 40 and 60 Gy. The grade of toxicities was defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0. Result(s): The mean and maximum doses of the intrathoracic stomach were 2449 +/- 986 cGy and 6519 +/- 406 cGy, respectively. Sixteen (15.2%) and three (2.9%) experienced Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 2 and Grade 3 acute gastric toxicity. There were no Grade 4 toxicities. Fourteen patients (13.3%) exhibited late gastric complications possibly related to radiation. The volume percent of the intrathoracic stomach receiving at least 50 Gy (V50) was strongly associated with the degree of toxicity (p = 0.024, respectively). Multivariate analysis of patient and treatmentrelated factors revealed no other significant predictors of severe toxicities. Conclusion(s): The intrathoracic stomach is well tolerated with a high-dose irradiation for patients with esophageal SCC receiving radiotherapy after esophagectomy. A strong dose-volume relationship exists for the development of Grade 2 acute intrathoracic stomach toxicity in our study.",Excluded,0.74062884
382,"Patterns of long-term swallowing dysfunction after definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiation Objectives To identify patterns of long-term, radiation-induced swallowing dysfunction after definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy (RT or CHRT) and to determine which factors may explain these patterns over time. Material and methods The study population consisted of 238 consecutive head and neck cancer patients treated with RT or CHRT. The primary endpoint was >=grade 2 swallowing dysfunction at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after treatment. Cluster analysis was used to identify different patterns over time. The differences between the mean dose to the swallowing organs at risk for each pattern were determined by using dose maps. Results The cluster analysis revealed five patterns of swallowing dysfunction: low persistent, intermediate persistent, severe persistent, transient and progressive. Patients with high dose to the upper pharyngeal, laryngeal and lower pharyngeal region had the highest risk of severe persistent swallowing dysfunction. Transient problems mainly occurred after high dose to the laryngeal and lower pharyngeal regions, combined with moderate dose to the upper pharyngeal region. The progressive pattern was mainly seen after moderate dose to the upper pharyngeal region. Conclusions Various patterns of swallowing dysfunction after definitive RT or CHRT can be identified over time. This could reflect different underlying biological processes.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Although radiotherapy is a standard part of the treatment armamentarium for KS patients, a high incidence of radiotoxicity has been reported in epidemic AIDS-related cases. In order to determine whether this radiotoxicity is observed only in patients with the epidemic form of the disease, we have conducted a retrospective chart review of 30 patients with classical KS treated with radiation for whom follow-up information was available. Seven out of 30 (23%) were found to have unexpectedly high levels of radiotoxicity after tumor doses of 22-42 Gy. This toxicity consisted either of significantly increased edema or chronic skin breakdown and severe radiodermatitis, in some cases requiring multiple surgical corrective procedures. We suggest that the abnormal lymphaticovenous development and chronic lymphokine stimulation associated with KS of both epidemic and classical forms may be responsible in part for the observed radiotoxicity.",Excluded,0.72095484

With follow-up results more than 5 years Therapeutic results are presented with follow-up examinations of at least 5 years (min. 5 years, max. 22 years) after 106Ru/106Rh plaque radiotherapy of posterior uveal melanomas. Out of 227 patients 146 (= 64.3%) could be treated successfully, 37 (= 16.3%) had to be enucleated and are alive, 44 (= 19.4%) died from metastases and 40 (17.6%) from other causes. 75.0% of all small melanomas (T1a) showed an excellent regression pattern to flat scars. Five years after treatment the survival rate was 83.7% (deaths from any causes) respectively 88.2% (deaths from metastases only) and 64.8% (deaths from any causes) respectively 79.7% (deaths from metastases only) ten years after irradiation. 106Ru/106Rh plaque radiotherapy can be recommended for small (T1a, b) and medium sized (T2) choroidal melanomas.",Excluded,0.7123941
152,"Lung Cancer Mortality in the Swiss Working Population: The Effect of Occupational and Non-Occupational Factors OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of occupational exposures on lung cancer mortality in Switzerland after adjustment for non-occupational lung carcinogens., METHODS: Using data on 4'351'383 Swiss residents, we used negative binomial regression to assess the effect occupation on lung cancer mortality between 1990 and 2014, accounting for socio-demographic factors, predicted probabilities of smoking and measured environmental radon exposure., RESULTS: After adjustment, male machine operators and workers in mining, stone working and building materials manufacturing showed the highest risk. Women working in electrical engineering, electronics, watchmaking, vehicle construction and toolmaking and transport occupations also remained at high-risk. Radon exposure had no effect on lung cancer mortality, while smoking demonstrated a significant effect in both sexes., CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest the presence of occupational exposures to lung carcinogens in addition to non-occupational factors.

715,"Increased metabolic activity in the spinal cord of patients with long-standing Lhermitte's sign PURPOSE: To investigate the pathophysiology of the radiation-induced, chronic Lhermitte's sign (LS) on the basis of long-standing case histories with partial functional recovery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: As radiotherapy in two nasopharyngeal cancer patients, a biologically effective dose (BED) of 103.8 Gy(2) (case 1) and 94.8 Gy(2) (case 2) was delivered to the cervical spinal cord. Neurologic signs relating to the irradiated spinal cord segments developed after 2 months (case 1) and 5 years (case 2), with radiation-induced damage equivalent to grade 3 (case 1) and grade 2 (case 2) toxicity (Common Toxicity Criteria, Version 2.0). The clinical status improved to grade 2 (case 1) and grade 1 (case 2). Positron emission tomography (PET) and fibroblast clonogen assay were applied 25 and 7 years postirradiation, respectively, to characterize this rare clinical picture., RESULTS: PET demonstrated increased [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation and [(15)O]butanol perfusion, but negligible [(11)C]methionine uptake in the irradiated spinal cord segments in both patients. In clonogenic assays, fibroblasts from case 1 displayed much higher radiation sensitivity than in healthy controls, while in case 2 the fibroblasts sensitivity was normal., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggests a close direct relationship between regional perfusion and metabolism of the spinal cord, similarly as in the brain. The postirradiation recovery may be related to energy-demanding conduction, explaining the increased metabolism and perfusion. The increased radiosensitivity and higher spinal cord BED may have contributed to the more severe sequelae in case 1.",Excluded,0.7007842

218,"Clinical outcomes of radiotherapy for spinal cord ependymoma with adverse prognostic features: a single-center study Purpose: This study evaluated the outcomes of radiotherapy (RT) for spinal ependymoma with adverse features, such as incomplete resection or disseminated disease. Method(s): Twenty-five patients underwent RT for spinal cord ependymoma during 1991-2016. Twenty-four patients had gross disease on the pre-RT spinal magnetic resonance images. Six patients (24%) had disseminated disease. The World Health Organization grades were I (12 patients), II (12 patients), and III (1 patient). The RT fields were the tumor bed plus margin in 19 patients (76%), the entire craniospinal axis in 5 patients (20%), and the entire spinal canal with posterior cranial fossa in 1 patient (4%). The median RT dose was 50.4 Gy (range 44.0-59.4 Gy). Result(s): The median follow-up was 49 months (range 9-321 months), with 5-year overall and progression-free survival rates of 83.7% and 70.8%, respectively. Relative to patients with grade II/III ependymoma, patients with grade I ependymoma had higher 5-year rates of overall survival (100% vs. 69.4%, P =.088) and progression-free survival (100% vs. 42.3%, P =.02). Disease progression was observed in 4 patients who had grade II ependymoma, including 2 of 6 patients with disseminated disease and 2 of 19 patients with localized disease. Twelve patients (48%) exhibited improved neurological function. One patient who underwent craniospinal irradiation developed late hypopituitarism. No other RT-related late toxicities were observed. Conclusion(s): Favorable survival outcomes were achieved using RT for spinal ependymoma with adverse prognostic features. Thus, RT may be an effective treatment option when complete tumor removal cannot be achieved.Copyright © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded,0.69140476
870,"Propensity score-based comparison of long-term outcomes with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy vs intensity-modulated radiotherapy for esophageal cancer PURPOSE: Although 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) is the worldwide standard for the treatment of esophageal cancer, intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) improves dose conformality and reduces the radiation exposure to normal tissues. We hypothesized that the dosimetric advantages of IMRT should translate to substantive benefits in clinical outcomes compared with 3D-CRT., METHODS AND MATERIALS: An analysis was performed of 676 nonrandomized patients (3D-CRT, n=413; IMRT, n=263) with stage Ib-IVa (American Joint Committee on Cancer 2002) esophageal cancers treated with chemoradiotherapy at a single institution from 1998-2008. An inverse probability of treatment weighting and inclusion of propensity score (treatment probability) as a covariate were used to compare overall survival time, interval to local failure, and interval to distant metastasis, while accounting for the effects of other clinically relevant covariates. The propensity scores were estimated using logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: A fitted multivariate inverse probability weighted-adjusted Cox model showed that the overall survival time was significantly associated with several well-known prognostic factors, along with the treatment modality (IMRT vs 3D-CRT, hazard ratio 0.72, P<.001). Compared with IMRT, 3D-CRT patients had a significantly greater risk of dying (72.6% vs 52.9%, inverse probability of treatment weighting, log-rank test, P<.0001) and of locoregional recurrence (P=.0038). No difference was seen in cancer-specific mortality (Gray's test, P=.86) or distant metastasis (P=.99) between the 2 groups. An increased cumulative incidence of cardiac death was seen in the 3D-CRT group (P=.049), but most deaths were undocumented (5-year estimate, 11.7% in 3D-CRT vs 5.4% in IMRT group, Gray's test, P=.0029)., CONCLUSIONS: Overall survival, locoregional control, and noncancer-related death were significantly better after IMRT than after 3D-CRT. Although these results need confirmation, IMRT should be considered for the treatment of esophageal cancer. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.6877385
830,"Cognitive function and social attainment in adult survivors of retinoblastoma: A report from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study BACKGROUND: Retinoblastoma has a 5-year survival rate exceeding 95%, yet little is known about long-term functional outcomes for these patients. METHOD(S): Sixty-nine adult survivors of retinoblastoma (mean age, 33 years; mean years post-diagnosis, 31) who had enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study completed clinical cognitive evaluations and questionnaires assessing adult social attainment. Scores on all cognitive measures were converted to z-scores (M = 0, SD = 1) using age-adjusted normative data. Multivariable linear regression analyses, adjusted for age at diagnosis and disease laterality, were used to examine associations between disease and treatment exposures and cognitive outcomes. RESULT(S): Retinoblastoma survivors performed within normative expectations across most cognitive domains. In multivariable models, adjusted for disease laterality, survivors diagnosed at <1 year of age performed significantly better on measures of short-term verbal memory (beta=0.87, P<.01), long-term verbal memory (beta=0.66, P=.02), verbal learning (beta = 0.67, P=.02), and verbal reasoning abilities (beta = 0.79, P<.01) compared with survivors diagnosed at <=1 year of age. In multivariable models, restricted to bilateral survivors and adjusted for age at diagnosis, whole brain radiation exposure was significantly associated with poorer performance on tasks of short-term verbal memory (beta=-0.003, P = .03) and long-term verbal memory (beta = 20.003, P = .01). Reported social attainment was consistent with adult developmental expectations. CONCLUSION(S): Adult survivors of retinoblastoma demonstrate few cognitive or social attainment deficits decades following diagnosis and treatment. Findings suggest the potential for neural reorganization following early insult to the visual system as well as vulnerability of the developing brain to low dose radiation exposure. Early intervention and rehabilitation will be important for these patients.Copyright © 2014 American Cancer Society.",Excluded,0.6706815
1195,"Adjuvant external beam radiation for medullary thyroid carcinoma Background: Adjuvant radiation is rarely used to treat medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). We hypothesized that external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) would improve overall survival (OS) in MTC patients. Method(s): The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database identified patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and lymph nodes excision for MTC between 1988 and 2004. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for univariate comparisons of OS. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models controlled for gender, age, lymph node status, tumor size, extent of disease, and EBRT. Result(s): After 12 years, EBRT did not significantly improve OS (log rank, P < 0.14). In node-positive patients, univariate analysis demonstrated an OS benefit with EBRT (log rank, P < 0.05). In a multivariate model of node-positive patients, only increasing age (P < 0.001) and tumor size (P < 0.001) significantly influenced OS. Conclusion(s): The OS benefit attributed to EBRT in node-positive patients by univariate analysis could not be duplicated when controlling for known prognostic factors. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded,0.6624703
1041,"Radiation exposure of extracranial organs at risk during stereotactic linac radiosurgery BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial tumors and vascular malformations can be performed by either a linear accelerator (Linac) or gamma knife. The aim of this first study on patients was to determine the radiation exposure of organs at risk and assess the risk for late effects including secondary tumors and/or hereditary disorders after stereotactic Linac radiosurgery., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) measurements were done on 21 consecutively admitted patients with various intracranial lesions scheduled for Linac radiosurgery. The TLD chips were placed on the eyelid, thyroid, breast and the regions of the ovary or testes., RESULTS: The mean doses in organs at risk were 276 +/- 200 mGy (eye lens), 155 +/- 83 mGy (thyroid), 47 +/- 22 mGy (breast), 20 +/- 12 mGy (ovary), and 9 +/- 3 mGy (testes). The doses decreased significantly with a larger distance from the isocenter., CONCLUSION: The absorbed doses to the extracranial organs at risk in patients undergoing Linac radiosurgery were very low, ranging from 0.025% (testes) to 0.76% (eye lens) of the mean maximum target dose (36 Gy). Nevertheless, while the majority of radiosurgery patients have benign tumors or arteriovenous malformations and their life expectancy is long, all doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable. This could be accomplished by the use of modern irradiation techniques including conformal beams with micro-multileaf collimator and avoiding beams directed to the trunk.",Excluded,0.6584569
887,"Minimally Invasive Stereotactical Radio-ablation of Adrenal Metastases as an Alternative to Surgery PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to study the clinical outcome for patients with metastases of the adrenal gland treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients were studied retrospectively. The dose prescription was 40 Gy in four fractions. Dosimetric analysis was performed using the dose volume histograms while clinical outcome was assessed using actuarial analysis with determination of the overall survival (OS) and local control (LC) rates., RESULTS: The planning objectives were met for all patients. With a median follow-up period of 7.6 months, at the last follow-up 42 patients (91.3%) were alive and four had died because of distant progression. The actuarial mean OS was 28.5+/-1.6 months, the median was not reached. One-year and 2-year OS were 87.6+/-6.1%. None of the risk factors was significant in univariate analysis. Actuarial mean LC was 14.6+/-1.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.0 to 18.2) and median LC was 14.5+/-2.0 months (95% CI, 10.5 to 18.5). One-year and 2-year LC were 65.5+/-11.9% and 40.7+/-15.8%, respectively. A mild profile of toxicity was observed in the cohort of patients. Forty patients (86.9%) showed no complication (grade 0); two patients reported asthenia, six patients (13.1%) reported either pain, nausea, or vomiting. Of these six patients, five patients (10.9%) were scored as grade 1 toxicity while one patient (2.2%) was scored as grade 2., CONCLUSION: Stereotactic body radiation therapy treatment provided an adequate clinical response in the management of adrenal gland metastases.",Excluded,0.65756327

A total of 80 patients with unresectable HCC treated in the First People's Hospital of Qinhuangdao from March 2009 to March 2015 were randomly divided into TACE group (n=40) and TACE + RT group (n=40). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the levels of p53 in both groups before and after treatment. The biochemical indexes of liver function [alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)] were detected. Moreover, adverse reactions were compared between the two groups of patients, the short-term therapeutic effect was evaluated, and effects of two treatment methods on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients were detected. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical data between the two groups of patients (P>0.05). The p53 protein levels were significantly downregulated in both treatment methods, and it was decreased more significantly in TACE + RT group than that in TACE group (P<0.05). Compared with those before treatment, AFP and GGT levels in both groups of patients after treatment were decreased, but the levels of ALT were increased (P<0.05), and TACE + RT group had a better curative effect than TACE group (P<0.05). Besides, the incidence rate of adverse reactions in TACE + RT group (37.5%) was obviously lower than that in TACE group (65%) (P<0.05). The number of patients with stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) and disease control rate (DCR) in TACE + RT group were superior to those in TACE group (P<0.05). The 2-year survival rate and median PFS of patients in TACE + RT group were also significantly better than those in TACE group (P<0.05). In conclusion, TACE combined with RT has a better clinical effect than TACE alone in the treatment of HCC.Copyright © 2018, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.65723294
8,"A multicenter, prospective pilot study of gamma knife radiosurgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy: seizure response, adverse events, and verbal memory OBJECTIVE: The safety, efficacy, and morbidity of radiosurgery (RS) must be established before it can be offered as an alternative to open surgery for unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We report the 3-year outcomes of a multicenter, prospective pilot study of RS., METHODS: RS was randomized to 20 or 24Gy targeting the amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Seizure diaries evaluated the final seizure remission between months 24 and 36. Verbal memory was evaluated at baseline and 24m with the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) and California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Patients were classified as having ""significant improvement,"" ""no change,"" and ""significant impairment"" based on relative change indices., RESULTS: Thirteen high-dose and 17 low-dose patients were treated. Both groups showed significant reductions in seizures by 1 year after treatment. At the 36-month follow-up evaluation, 67% of patients were free of seizures for the prior 12 months (high dose: 10/13, 76.9%; low dose: 10/17, 58.8%). Use of steroids, headaches, and visual field defects did not differ by dose or seizure remission. The prevalence of verbal memory impairment was 15% (4/26 patients); none declined on more than one measure. The prevalence of significant verbal memory improvements was 12% (3/26)., INTERPRETATION: RS for unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy offers seizure remission rates comparable with those reported previously for open surgery. There were no major safety concerns with high-dose RS compared with low-dose RS. Additional research is required to determine whether RS may be a treatment option for some patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.",Excluded,0.6516734

All the gamma-irradiated allografts (tibialis anterior tendons) received an irradiation dose of 2.5 Mrad before distribution. Patients in this study had undergone a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan and physical examination. Patients were excluded from the study if they had a concomitant injury to other knee ligaments, previous surgery on the injured knee, or articular cartilage lesions greater than Outerbridge grade II. Clinical and proprioceptive evaluation results were collected preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months after surgery., RESULTS: The autograft, allograft, and hybrid graft groups were followed up for 5.5 +/- 0.2 months (range, 5 to 6 years), 5.7 +/- 0.3 months (range, 5 to 6 years), and 5.6 +/- 0.5 months (range, 5 to 6 years), respectively. No statistically significant differences were found among the 3 groups regarding preoperative demographic factors (P > .05). The differences in physical examination findings and subjective evaluations among the 3 groups were not significant (P > .05). However, a significant difference was detected in instrumented anteroposterior measurements, with more laxity shown in the gamma-irradiated allograft group than in the other 2 groups (P = .006)., CONCLUSIONS: The differences in proprioceptive and functional outcomes among the 3 groups were not significant.

All patients had bulky disease (> or =5 cm) and/or an inadequate response to salvage chemotherapy. The IFRT dose was escalated to a maximum of 36 Gy. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as Grade 3-4 Bearman toxicity (life-threatening/fatal toxicity occurring within 28 days of ASCT). The chemotherapy regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carmustine., RESULTS: The delivered dose of IFRT was 20 Gy in 9 patients, 28-30 Gy in 20, and 32-36 Gy in 2 patients to mediastinal (n = 19) and nonmediastinal (n = 12) sites. The median interval between IFRT completion and ASCT was 19 days. One patient developed Bearman Grade 3 hepatic toxicity. No other Grade 3 or 4 Bearman toxicity was observed. An increased requirement for i.v. narcotics was observed in patients treated with mediastinal IFRT vs. nonmediastinal IFRT (p = 0.02). A trend toward increased mucositis severity was seen in patients previously treated with a larger number of chemotherapy agents (p = 0.09) and in those with a shorter interval between IFRT and ASCT (p = 0.12). Pulmonary toxicity was more common in patients treated with mediastinal IFRT than in those treated with nonmediastinal IFRT (21% vs. 0%, p = 0.13). The 2-year overall and progression-free survival rate was 70% and 49% for all patients, 84% and 50% for patients with Hodgkin's disease, and 59% and 47% for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively., CONCLUSION: The maximal tolerated dose of IFRT was not reached when Grade 3-4 Bearman toxicity was dose limiting. Increased pulmonary toxicity and mucositis severity was seen after mediastinal IFRT compared with nonmediastinal IFRT. Because local control was excellent, higher doses of IFRT are not recommended. The absolute benefit of IFRT in this patient population needs investigation in future studies.",Excluded,0.6363306
317,"Clinical experience in 89 consecutive cases of chronic radiation enterocolitis BACKGROUND: Pelvic irradiation has been a popular therapy modality for cervical cancer for many years, and its usage in rectal cancer and prostate cancer cases is on the rise. However, it is associated with significant side effects. In this study, we compared the different characteristics of surgical and nonsurgical patients who were treated for radiation enterocolitis, the treatment results, posttreatment quality of life (QOL), nutrition status, and predisposing factors for surgery., METHODS: From 1985 to 2009, the records of a total of 89 patients with chronic radiation enterocolitis in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed for demographic data, operative data and long-term treatment results. Posttreatment QOL and nutrition status were also recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the independent predicting factors associated with surgical intervention. Characteristics of surgical and nonsurgical patients were compared., RESULTS: Radiotherapy before 1995, concomitant radiation uropathy and smoking were independent predictive factors for surgery. Surgical and nonsurgical cases had similar Kaplan-Meier curves. Although the recurrence rate of radiation enterocolitis was much higher for the surgical group (p = 0.031), both groups had similar QOL score (median: 8 vs.7; p = 0.709), serum albumin level (3.29 g/dL vs. 3.16 g/dL; p = 0.095), and body mass index (20.19 vs. 19.86; p = 0.603)., CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that as compared with recently developed innovative techniques, early primitive radiotherapy techniques were associated with more severe radiotherapy complications that required surgery. Smoking may enhance patients' vulnerability to severe radiation injury. Surgery for radiation-induced intestinal obstruction, intestinal fistula and perforation is warranted because QOL, serum albumin level and body mass index were similar between the surgical and nonsurgical groups.

480,"Impact of VMAT-IMRT compared to 3D conformal radiotherapy on anal sphincter dose distribution in neoadjuvant chemoradiation of rectal cancer Background: Neoadjuvant radio- or chemoradiation (nIRT) therapy is the standard treatment for loco-regional advanced rectal cancer patients of the lower or middle third. Currently, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is not the recommended radiation technique even though IMRT has advantages compared to 3D-radiation regarding dose sparing to organs at risk like small bowel and urinary bladder. So far, the benefit of IMRT concerning the anal sphincter complex is not examined. With this study we intended to evaluate the dose distribution on the anal sphincters of rectal cancer patients treated with IMRT in comparison with 3D-techniques. Method(s): We selected 16 patients for the IMRT-group and 16 patients for the 3D-group with rectal cancer of the middle third who were treated in our institute. All patients received 45 Gy in a chemoradiation protocol. Patients in both groups were matched regarding stage, primary tumor distance to the anal verge and size of the tumor. We delineated the internal and external anal sphincters, the addition of both sphincters and the levator ani muscle in all patients. Subsequently, we evaluated and compared dose parameters of the different sphincters in both groups and analysed the configuration of the isodoses in the area of the caudal radiation field, respectively. Result(s): Most of the relevant dose parameters of the caudal sphincters (Dmean, Dmedian, V10-V40) were significantly reduced in the IMRT-group compared to the 3D-group. Accordingly, the isodoses at the caudal edge of the target volume in the IMRT group demonstrated a steep dose fall. The levator ani muscle always was included into the planned target volumes and received the full dose in both groups. Conclusion(s): The modern VMAT-IMRT can significantly reduce the dose to the anal sphincters for rectal cancer patients of the middle third who were treated with conventional chemoradiation therapy.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded,0.62635666

The aim of this study was to determine if application of these QUANTEC criteria also protected against moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 307 head and neck cancer patients treated with primary (chemo)radiotherapy, either with 3D-CRT (56%) or with IMRT (44%). All patients participated in a standard follow-up program in which radiation-induced toxicity and quality of life were prospectively assessed. Patients who met the QUANTEC criteria were classified as low risk and otherwise as high risk., RESULTS: In total, 41% of the patients (treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT) were classified as low risk patients. In the group treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT, it was possible to meet the QUANTEC criteria in 47% and 32% of the patients, respectively. Sparing the parotid glands with IMRT was considerably more difficult in patients with lymph node metastases and in patients with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal tumours. Low risk patients reported significantly less moderate-to-severe xerostomia than high risk patients. However, the predicted risk of elderly patients and patients with pre-existing minor patient-rated xerostomia at baseline was > 20%, even when the QUANTEC criteria were met., CONCLUSIONS: Significantly lower rates of radiation-induced patient-rated xerostomia were found among low risk patients treated according to the QUANTEC criteria, but these criteria do not completely protect against xerostomia. Particularly in elderly patients and patients already suffering from minor xerostomia at baseline, the QUANTEC criteria do not sufficiently protect against persistent, moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia.",Excluded,0.62162834

Both sexes were considered to have anemia if their hemoglobin level was < or = 12 g/dL. No patient received corrective treatment for hemoglobin levels. Acute toxicity was analyzed weekly during radiotherapy and 45 days after therapy ended. The possible relationship between anemia and toxicity was analyzed, as was the correlation between hemoglobin values and the degree of toxicity., RESULTS: The findings were similar for all prognostic factors in patients with and without anemia. Hemoglobin concentration was < or = 12 g/dL in 24 patients (27.9%; mean, 10.93 +/- 0.78 g/dL). At the end of radiotherapy, hemoglobin levels were < or = 12 g/dL in 18 patients (20.9%; mean, 11.26 +/- 1.06 g/dL). The correlation between pretherapy and posttherapy hemoglobin concentration was significant at r = 0.729 (P = 0.01). The correlation between absolute hemoglobin values and the degree of toxicity, and the possible relationship between hemoglobin concentration and the appearance or the degree of toxicity after radiotherapy, was not significant., CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation of the tumor and healthy tissues was not linear. This may account for the influence of hemoglobin levels on control of the disease as reported in earlier studies, but it does not account for their influence on acute toxicity after radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.62016
763,"Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery and Radiotherapy to Large Resection Cavity of Metastatic Brain Tumors Objective To evaluate the efficacy of postoperative fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (FSRS) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) to large surgical cavities after gross total resection of brain metastases. Methods A retrospective analysis of 41 patients who had received tumor-bed FSRS (5 fractions) or SRT (10 fractions) after resection of brain metastasis between 2005 and 2015 was performed. All resection cavities were treated with a frameless linear accelerator-based system. Patients who underwent subtotal resection, single-dose SRS to the resection cavity, or were treated with a fractionation schedule other than 5 or 10 fractions, were excluded. Results Twenty-six patients were treated with 5 fractions and 15 patients with 10 fractions. The median planning target volume was 19.78 cm3 (12.3-28 cm3) to the 5-fraction group and 29.79 cm3 (26.3-47.6 cm3) to the 10-fraction group (P = 0.020). The 1-year and 2-year local control rates for all patients were 89.4% and 77.1%, respectively, and 89.6% and 78.6% were free from distant intracranial progression, respectively. No difference was observed in local control or freedom from distant intracranial progression between the 5-fraction or 10-fraction groups. The median overall survival was 28.27 months (95% confidence interval, 19.42-37.12) for all patients. No patient developed necrosis at the resection cavity. Conclusions Fractionation offers the potential to exploit the different biological responses between neoplastic and normal tissues to ionizing radiation. The use of 5 daily doses of 5-6 Gy or 10 daily doses of 3 Gy is a good strategy to have a reasonable local control and avoid neurotoxicity.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.61675936
395,"Optimization of stereotactic radiotherapy treatment delivery technique for base-of-skull meningiomas This study compares static conformal field (CF), intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and dynamic arcs (DA) for the stereotactic radiotherapy of base-of-skull meningiomas. Twenty-one cases of base-of-skull meningioma (median planning target volume [PTV] = 21.3 cm3) previously treated with stereotactic radiotherapy were replanned with each technique. The plans were compared for Radiation Therapy Oncology Group conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI), and doses to normal structures at 6 dose values from 50.4 Gy to 5.6 Gy. The mean CI was 1.75 (CF), 1.75 (DA), and 1.66 (IMRT) (p < 0.05 when comparing IMRT to either CF or DA plans). The CI (IMRT) was inversely proportional to the size of the PTV (Spearman's rho = -0.53, p = 0.01) and at PTV sizes above 25 cm3, the CI (IMRT) was always superior to CI (DA) and CI (CF). At PTV sizes below 25 cm3, there was no significant difference in CI between each technique. There was no significant difference in HI between plans. The total volume of normal tissue receiving 50.4, 44.8, and 5.6 Gy was significantly lower when comparing IMRT to CF and DA plans (p < 0.05). There was significantly improved dose sparing for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe with IMRT but no significant difference for the optic chiasm or pituitary gland. These results demonstrate that stereotactic IMRT should be considered to treat base-of-skull meningiomas with a PTV larger than 25 cm3, due to improved conformity and normal tissue sparing, in particular for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe.",Excluded,0.61032087
268,"Cancer of the parotid gland; Long-term follow-up. A single centre experience on recurrence and survival Background. The aim of the study was to investigate the results of treatment of malignant parotid gland tumours at a single centre during a 56 year period, focusing on tumour control and survival. Patients and methods. At Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden, 144 patients (73 male and 71 female) with parotid cancer were treated between 1948 and 2004. The mean and median ages were 62 and 65 years, respectively (range 1689 years). Surgery was the primary treatment in 113 (78%) patients followed by radiotherapy in 81. Postoperative radiotherapy in doses of 6466 Gy, where the intention was curative and delivered with either split course or not, was administered to a majority of patients after 1970. The split-course mode was practised between 1970 and 1989. The median follow-up time was 8.3 years for patients still alive. There were 57 (40%) relapses, of which 40 were local recurrences with 26 inside the treatment volume.Results. The overall 5-year survival was 53%. The majority of tumour-related deaths appeared in the first 3-5 years after diagnosis. Age, co-morbidity, the presence of lymph node metastases, adenoid cystic carcinoma and extent of disease were important for outcome; gender, however, was not. We found no difference in the survival between patients following split course therapy versus continuous fractionation. No difference could be seen in the survival of patients treated in the 1970s versus the 1990s. Conclusions. Age, nodal engagement, a higher T-stage, adenoid cystic carcinoma histopathology, facial palsy and intercurrent disease worsen the outcome of patients, whereas gender does not. Treatment principles at our hospital have been surgery followed by radiotherapy since the early 1970s even though a split course technique was practised during a part of this period. Survival has not improved markedly. Thus, there is scope for improvement for this group of patients.",Excluded,0.6075602

424,"Frameless Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis-Related Trigeminal Neuralgia Background Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) affects 7% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In such patients, TN is difficult to manage either pharmacologically and surgically. Radiosurgical rhizotomy is an effective treatment option. The nonisocentric geometry of radiation beams of CyberKnife introduces new concepts in the treatment of TN. Its efficacy for MS-related TN has not yet been demonstrated. Methods Twenty-seven patients with refractory TN and MS were treated. A nonisocentric beams distribution was chosen; the maximal target dose was 72.5 Gy. The maximal dose to the brainstem was <12 Gy. Effects on pain, medications, sensory disturbance, rate, and time of pain recurrence were analyzed. Results Median follow-up was 37 (18-72) months. Barrow Neurological Institute pain scale score I-III was achieved in 23/27 patients (85%) within 45 days. Prescription isodose line (80%) accounting for a dose of 58 Gy incorporated an average of 4.85 mm (4-6 mm) of the nerve and mean nerve volume of 26.4 mm3 (range 20-38 mm3). Seven out of 27 patients (26%) had mild, not bothersome, facial numbness (Barrow Neurological Institute numbness score II). The rate of pain control decreased progressively after the first year, and only 44% of patients retained pain control 4 years later. Conclusions Frameless radiosurgery can be effectively used to perform retrogasserian rhizotomy. Pain relief was satisfactory and, with our dose/volume constraints, no sensory complications were recorded. Nonetheless, long-term pain control was possible in less than half of the patients. This is a limitation that CyberKnife radiosurgery shares with other techniques in MS patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.60372335
476,"Hyperfractionated Accelerated Radiotherapy (HART) for anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: toxicity and survival analysis PURPOSE: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is one of the most aggressive cancers, and the current protocol of hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy was initiated to improve survival while limiting toxicities., METHODS AND MATERIALS: All patients with ATC from 1991 to 2002 were accrued and received megavoltage radiotherapy from the mastoid processes to the carina up to 60 Gy in twice-daily fractions of 1.8 and 2 Gy, 6 hours apart., RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were accrued with a median age of 69 years, and 55% were women. Debulking was performed in 26%, and total thyroidectomy, in 6%, whereas 68% received radical radiotherapy alone. Local control data were available for 27 patients: 22% had a complete response, 26% had a partial response, 15% showed progressive disease, and 37% showed static disease. Median overall survival for all 31 patients was 70 days (95% confidence interval, 40-99). There was no significant difference in median survival between patients younger (70 days) and older than 70 years (42 days), between men (70 days) and women (49 days), and between patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy (77 days) and radical radiotherapy alone (35 days). Grade III or higher skin erythema was seen in 56% patients; desquamation in 21%; dysphagia in 74%; and esophagitis in 79%., CONCLUSION: The current protocol failed to offer a significant survival benefit, was associated with severe toxicities, and thus was discontinued.

1152,"Efficacy and safety of radiotherapy in acromegaly Background and Aims: Transsphenoidal surgery remains the treatment of choice in acromegaly, yet 40-50% of patients require secondary forms of therapy such as radiation therapy (RT) and somatostatin analogues (SA). We undertook this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RT in acromegaly. Method(s): Forty patients with acromegaly treated with RT (mean dose, 52 Gy) after failed pituitary surgery between 1993 and 2007 were analyzed; all were clinically and biochemically active. Patients were evaluated with yearly hormonal measurements [basal and glucose-suppressed growth hormone (GH), IGF-1, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T4, cortisol, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone or estradiol and prolactin (PRL)] and with magnetic resonance imaging every 2 years. Result(s): Mean age of patients was 52.9 +/- 12.1 years and 85% were female. All subjects had been followed for 1 year, 75% for 3 years, 70% for 5 years and 35% for 10 years. The median basal GH level fell from a baseline of 8.8 ng/mL to 2.27 ng/mL at 5 years (p = 0.001) and to 1.88 ng/mL at 10 years (p = 0.001). A GH <1 ng/mL was achieved by 46% and 57% of the patients at 5 and 10 years of follow-up, respectively. The proportion of patients achieving a normal IGF-1 was 36% at 5 years and 43% at 10 years. Before RT, hypothyroidism, hypocortisolism and hypogonadism were present in 44%, 26% and 74% of patients, respectively. After 5 years of follow-up (n = 28), these figures increased to 51%, 41% and 79% and over a third of the group had panhypopituitarism. One patient developed optic neuritis and another patient was diagnosed with a meningioma 10 years after RT. No cerebrovascular events or deaths occurred. Conclusion(s): RT is an effective, low-cost and reasonably safe means of controlling acromegalic activity, particularly useful in parts of the world where SA are not readily available. © 2011 IMSS.",Excluded,0.59972614
1073,"Radiotherapy for benign head and neck paragangliomas: A 45-year experience BACKGROUND: Paragangliomas of the head and neck are rare, slow-growing, generally benign tumors of neuroendocrine cells associated with the peripheral nervous system that commonly involve the carotid body, jugular bulb, vagal ganglia, and temporal bone. Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy (RT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and observation. This article briefly reviews our 45-year institutional experience treating this neoplasm with RT., METHODS: From January 1968 through March 2011, 131 patients with 156 benign paragangliomas of the temporal bone, carotid body, jugular bulb, or glomus vagale were treated with RT at a median dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions. The mean and median follow-up times were 11.5 years and 8.7 years, respectively., RESULTS: Five tumors (3.2%) recurred locally after RT, all within 10 years of treatment. The overall local control rates at 5 and 10 years were 99% and 96%, respectively. The cause-specific survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 98% and 97%, respectively. The distant-metastasis free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 99% and 99%, respectively. The overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 91% and 72%, respectively. There were no severe complications., CONCLUSION: RT for benign head and neck paragangliomas is a safe and efficacious treatment associated with minimal morbidity. Surgery is reserved for patients in good health whose risk of associated morbidity is low. SRS may be suitable for patients with skull base tumors <3 cm where RT is logistically unsuitable. Observation is a reasonable option for asymptomatic patients with a limited life expectancy.Copyright © 2014 American Cancer Society.",Excluded,0.59609336
384,"Optimal management in optic nerve sheath meningioma - A multicentre study and pooled data analysis Optic nerve sheath meningiomas (ONSMs) are rare, benign neoplasms of the anterior visual pathway. The optimal modality of radiotherapy for treatment has not yet been established. This is the first study to show significant difference in visual outcomes between radiotherapy subtypes in the management of ONSM. We performed a retrospective analysis of visual outcomes and side effects in ONSM patients treated with radiotherapy at three centres in Sydney, Australia, between 2000 and 2016. 15 patients with ONSM were included, and visual outcomes (visual acuity, visual fields, colour vision, OCT retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and radiological tumour response) and treatment toxicities were assessed. Pooled data analysis of available studies was also performed. Statistical analysis was performed with binomial, two-tailed chi-squared tests and Fisher exact tests. In our cohort a significant majority experienced improved visual field (p = 0.046), stable or improved visual acuity (p = 0.0017) and colour vision (p = 0.015) after fractionated radiotherapy. Pooled analysis with strict inclusion criteria found 3D conformal radiotherapy to offer significantly poorer visual acuity compared to fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (p = 0.008). When all published studies were included, stereotactic radiosurgery was superior to 3D conformal methods (p = 0.035), and equivalent to other fractionated methods. 3D conformal methods also had significantly higher rates of long-term side effects. These results support the use of fractionated radiotherapy and radiosurgery for ONSM treatment, however 3D conformal methods cannot be recommended.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded,0.58943677
709,"Local control and fracture risk following stereotactic body radiation therapy for non-spine bone metastases Aims: To report local control and toxicity rates for patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for non-spine bone metastases. Methods and materials: Eighty-one patients with 106 non-spine bone metastases were treated between 2011 and 2014 and retrospectively reviewed. Indications included: oligometastases (63%), oligoprogression (17.3%), retreatment (2.4%) or other (17.3%). Cumulative incidence function was used to assess local recurrence and fracture probability. Bivariate relationships were investigated based on selected patient, tumour and dose-volume factors. Result(s): Mean follow-up was 13 months (range, 0.25-45.6) and the median patient age was 66.4 years (range, 36-86). Most patients were male (60.5%) and the predominant histology prostate cancer (32%). Bone metastases were most commonly located in the pelvis (41.5%) and almost half sclerotic. The most common prescriptions were 30 Gy/5 (30.2%) and 35 Gy/5 (42.5%). The cumulative incidence of local recurrence at 6,18 and 24 months respectively was 4.7%, 8.3% and 13.3% with a mean time to local recurrence of 11.8 months (range, 3.9-23.4). A significant association was found between local recurrence and volume of the PTV (p = 0.02), with larger PTVs having a greater risk of local failure. Fracture was observed radiographically in the treatment volume in 9/106 (8.5%) of treated lesions and the mean time to fracture was 8.4 months (range, 0.7-32.5 months). With respect to predictors, a trend was observed for lytic lesions (p = 0.11) and female gender (p = 0.09). Conclusion(s): The results of this study confirm that SBRT yields high rates of long-term local control for non-spine bone metastases with a low fracture risk.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,0.58903426

The volumes of the optic nerve receiving doses of more than 7.5 or 12 Gy, respectively, were defined. Optic nerve circumference included in the 30%, 40%, 50%, or 80% isodose (ON%) and retina included in 30% or 40% were determined as quantal effects. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for clinical variables as well as probit analysis to define EDx (doses where a positive response is expected in x% of the cases)., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 90.0 (interquartile range 69.0-98.0) months. Fifty-two (71%) and 49 (67%) patients developed radiation retinopathy and optic neuropathy (any grade). Age, length of follow-up and diabetes were significant parameters regarding retinopathy. Optic neuropathy was significantly influenced by age, length of follow-up, and ON30. The probability of optic neuropathy (any grade and grade >= 2) significantly increases with the dose (p ranges from 0.0126 to 0.0211)., CONCLUSION: Treatment planning should aim at minimizing encompassing isodoses particularly in the low dose region, without compromising PTV coverage.

115,"Kypho-IORT: Intraoperative radiotherapy in spinal metastases: Nine-month clinical results BACKGROUND CONTEXT: A new technique of combined kyphoplasty and intraoperative radiation therapy (Kypho-IORT) was introduced in 2010 [1]. The indication, rationale and possible advantages have been published in 2011 [2]. In the first clinical period several technical improvements and modifications could stabilize the method, its clinical feasibility and shortterm safety has been shown [3]. Due to the higher local radiation doses compared to extracorporal radiotherapy (EBRT) permitted by the steep dose fall off of the IORT-source a higher local tumor control can potentially be achieved by Kypho-IORT. In this study we present an intermediate prospective follow-up of 9-month after Kypho-IORT. PURPOSE: Local tumor control and clinical use of Kypho-IORT. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Evidence level IV: prospective case series. PATIENT SAMPLE: 62 patients suffering from 77 spinal metastases which were treated with Kypho-IORT were included in the prospective study. Data of 16 patients who finished the 4th follow-up appointment after around 9 months and were interpreted. OUTCOME MEASURES: Acquired basic data were gender, age at surgery, tumor entity, treated vertebral level, delivered dose. Prospective collected data were pain measure by visual analogue scale (VAS) preoperative and at follow-up, Karnofsky Index, local metastasis control in the treated vertebra and general progression of metastases by CT or MRI. METHOD(S): Clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations. RESULT(S): 16 patients (12 females, 4 males) with an average age of 61 years were included. Twelve patients had breast cancer, two patients suffered prostate cancer and one each with lung, ovarian and sigmoid cancer. Thirteen thoracic and 4 lumbar vertebrae were treated with an average surgical time of 70 minutes per vertebra. The time from surgery to the 9-month follow-up was in average 348 days. The Karnofsky index was constant with 87 preoperative versus 86 at follow-up. The VAS average decreased from 4.1 preoperative to 1.4 postoperative and 0.8 at follow-up. In all cases but two, a dose of 8gy in a radius of 5mm was delivered successfully, two cases with second dose level at 8gy in 8mm distance to isocenter. Three patients had a local progress, one patient due to incorrect indication. Two vertebrae needed open revision surgery; one local progress was treated only with EBRT. Eight patients showed a general tumor progress. CONCLUSION(S): Kypho-IORT can offer a fast postoperative pain reduction, immediate stabilization and prevention of secondary fractures in the treated vertebrae by kyphoplasty which could be confirmed in this small cohort. The VAS decreased postoperative and this level was maintained during follow-up. Local tumor control (indication failures ignored) by intraoperative radiation could be achieved in 87% of the vertebrae over the 9 months period, which seems to be better than single fraction radiation schedules and at least comparable to multiple fraction schedules of conventional radiation. Furthermore the Karnofsky-Index stayed constant over the follow-up period which proves the low morbidity of the intervention in short and in intermediate term. All 14 of 16 patients of the 9-month-follow- up were treated with the lowest calculated treatment dose; probably an even higher local tumor control is achievable by higher local radiation doses.These results warrant further evaluation of this technique by a dose escalation and a multicenter study, which is currently under way.",Excluded,0.5880494

759,"Radio-resistant recipient bone marrow (BM) macrophages (MACS) are necessary for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftment post transplantation For decades it has been assumed that lethal irradiation in bone marrow transplantation experiments ablates the entire host hematopoietic system but preserves the host non-hematopoietic bone marrow stroma. This postulate is at the basis of transplantation chimera experiments in mice to test involvement of hematopoietic cells versus non-hematopoietic stroma. As BM-Macs support HSC niche homeostasis, we examined whether host-derived BM-Macs persist lethal irradiation and play a role in HSC engraftment. Recipient MacGreen mice (expressing GFP in myeloid cells under the control of Csf1r promoter) were lethally irradiated (11.5Gy) and transplanted with sorted syngeneic B6.SJL CD45.1+ Lin-Kit+Sca1+ sorted cells. Flow cytometry analyses of BM 2-30 weeks (wk) post-transplant confirmed more than 99% donor chimerism of monocytes and granulocytes validating ablation of recipient HSC. In contrast, GFP+CD11b+F4/80+CD169+VCAM-1+ERHR3+Ly6Gneg recipient BM-Macs were detected throughout the time-course. A 5.9 fold expansion of these recipient BM-Macs occurred between wk 2 and 5 (from 45,000 to 270,000 cells/femur) post-transplant which coincided with increased number of phenotypic donor HSC (GFP-Lin-Kit+Sca1+CD48-CD150+). Host BM-Mac proliferation was cell autonomous in the absence of host HSC and granulocytes. Recipient Macs in spleen displayed different frequency and longevity kinetics that correlated with transient post-Tx splenic extramedullary haematopoiesis. In situ, GFP+F480+ recipient BM-Macs were enriched in perivascular microenvironments within both central BM and endosteal regions. These GFP+ host-derived macrophages persisted long-term forming 8.4% of BM macrophages 7months post-transplant. To evaluate the importance of these host-derived radiation-resistant macrophages, we selectively depleted recipient BM-Macs using CD169-DTR mice transplanted with syngeneic ubiquitous GFP+ HSC. Depletion of recipient CD169+ Macs abated engraftment of donor phenotypic HSC by 70% at 5 wk post-transplant and reduced BM reconstitution potential in competitive secondary transplants. In conclusion BM contains a myeloablation-resistant self-repopulating Mac subset that is necessary for efficient and/or sustained HSC BM engraftment following transplantation. Therefore interpretation of transplantation chimera experiments must take into account the persistence of this subset of host macrophages that support donor HSC engraftment.",Excluded,0.58419126
413,"Patterns of relapse following surgery and postoperative intensity modulated radiotherapy for oral and oropharyngeal cancer Background. To investigate the patterns of relapse following intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) given after radical surgery for oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer. Patients and methods. One hundred and two patients with oral or oropharyngeal cancer were treated with radical surgery followed by IMRT up to a mean total dose of 60 Gy between years 2001 and 2007. Thirty-nine of the patients (%) also received concomitant weekly cisplatin. Forty of the patients had oral and 62 had oropharyngeal cancer. Data on the tumour, patient and treatment factors were collected. Following therapy the patients were followed by clinical examination, endoscopy and MRI/CT at 2- to 3-months interval up to 2 years and thereafter at 6-month intervals. Results. The mean follow-up time of the patients was 55 months (range, 26-106 months). The rate for local tumour control for the whole cohort was 92.2%: 87.5% for oral cancer patients and 96.7% for oropharyngeal cancer patients. The 5-year disease specific survival was 90.2% and 5-year overall survival 84.3%. During the follow-up eight locoregional recurrences were observed, three at the primary tumour site and one at regional nodal site and four at both sites. The mean time to primary tumour recurrence was seven months (range, 2-10 months) and to nodal recurrence seven months (range, 2-12 months). Distant metastasis occurred in six (6%) patients. The factors associated with poor prognosis were the primary tumour size and tumour site with oral cancers having worse outcome. The treatment was well tolerated with no unexpected toxicities. The most frequent late toxicity was dysphagia necessitating permanent PEG in five patients. This was correlated with the advanced primary tumour size and resulting in wide tumour excision and reconstruction. Conclusions. Surgery combined with postoperative radiotherapy given as IMRT results in low level of tumour recurrence. © 2011 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded,0.58308905
468,"Conditional survival among patients with oropharyngeal cancer treated with radiation therapy and alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis Background: Risk of recurrence among patients with oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) who survive 5 years is low. The goal of this study was to assess long-term survival of patients with OPC alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis. Method(s): This study included newly diagnosed patients with OPC, who had been treated with radiation and were alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis. Overall survival (OS) probabilities beyond 5 years were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Factors associated with OS were determined using Bayesian piecewise exponential survival regression. Standardized mortality ratios for all-cause death were estimated controlling for study year, age, and sex in the US general population. Result(s): Among 1699 patients, the additional 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year OS probabilities were 94%, 83%, and 63%, respectively, and were lower than those in the general population. Patients who were older, were current or former smokers, had other than tonsil or base of tongue tumors, or had T4 tumors had a higher risk of death. Patients who had base of tongue tumors and had received intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or lower-radiation doses had a lower risk of death. Standardized mortality ratios were higher among current and heavy smokers and lower among recipients of IMRT and lower radiation doses. Conclusion(s): In this large cohort, long-term survival among patients with OPC was good but lower than predicted for the general population. Patients treated with IMRT and those with less tobacco exposure had better outcomes.Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society",Excluded,0.5830225
575,"Phase 2 study of preoperative image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy to reduce wound and combined modality morbidities in lower extremity soft tissue sarcoma BACKGROUND: This study sought to determine if preoperative image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) can reduce morbidity, including wound complications, by minimizing dose to uninvolved tissues in adults with lower extremity soft tissue sarcoma. METHOD(S): The primary endpoint was the development of an acute wound complication (WC). IG-IMRT was used to conform volumes to avoid normal tissues (skin flaps for wound closure, bone, or other uninvolved soft tissues). From July 2005 to June 2009, 70 adults were enrolled; 59 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Median tumor size was 9.5 cm; 55 tumors (93%) were high-grade and 58 (98%) were deep to fascia. RESULT(S): Eighteen (30.5%) patients developed WCs. This was not statistically significantly different from the result of the National Cancer Institute of Canada SR2 trial (P =.2); however, primary closure technique was possible more often (55 of 59 patients [93.2%] versus 50 of 70 patients [71.4%]; P =.002), and secondary operations for WCs were somewhat reduced (6 of 18 patients [33%] versus 13 of 30 patients [43%]; P =.55). Moderate edema, skin, subcutaneous, and joint toxicity was present in 6 (11.1%), 1 (1.9%), 5 (9.3%), and 3 (5.6%) patients, respectively, but there were no bone fractures. Four local recurrences (6.8%, none near the flaps) occurred with median follow-up of 49 months. CONCLUSION(S): The 30.5% incidence of WCs was numerically lower than the 43% risk derived from the National Cancer Institute of Canada SR2 trial, but did not reach statistical significance. Preoperative IG-IMRT significantly diminished the need for tissue transfer.

824,"Increased evidence for the prognostic value of FDG uptake on late-treatment PET in non-tumour-affected oesophagus in irradiated patients with oesophageal carcinoma PURPOSE: 18F-FDG uptake in irradiated non-tumour-affected oesophagus (NTO) on restaging PET is a potential surrogate for the measurement of radiation-induced inflammation. Radiation-induced inflammation itself has been shown to be of high prognostic relevance in patients undergoing preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) for locally advanced oesophageal cancer. We assessed the prognostic relevance of FDG uptake in the NTO in an independent cohort of patients treated with definitive RCT., METHODS: This retrospective evaluation included 72 patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with definitive RCT with curative intent. All patients underwent pretreatment and restaging FDG PET after receiving a radiation dose of 40-50 Gy. Standardized uptake values (SUVmax/SUVmean), metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and relative changes from pretreatment to restaging PET (SUVmax/SUVmean) were determined within the tumour and NTO. Univariate Cox regression with respect to overall survival (OS), local control (LC), distant metastases (DM) and treatment failure (TF) was performed. Independence of parameters was tested by multivariate Cox regression., RESULTS: SUVmax NTO and MTV were prognostic factors for all investigated clinical endpoints (OS, LC, DM, TF). Inclusion of clinical and PET tumour parameters in multivariate analysis showed that SUVmax NTO was an independent prognostic factor. Furthermore, multivariate analysis of SUVmax NTO using previously published cut-off values from preoperatively treated patients revealed that SUVmax NTO was independent prognostic factor for OS (HR = 1.88, p = 0.038), TF (HR = 2.11, p = 0.048) and DM (HR = 3.02, p = 0.047)., CONCLUSION: NTO-related tracer uptake during the course of treatment in patients with oesophageal carcinoma was shown to be of high prognostic relevance. Thus, metabolically activity of NTO measured in terms of SUVmax NTO is a potential candidate for future treatment individualization (i.e. organ preservation).",Excluded,0.57757246
1099,"Long-Term, Prospective Performance of the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory in ""Low-Intermediate Risk"" Oropharyngeal Carcinoma After Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy PURPOSE: To characterize long-term MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) results after primary intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) among patients with ""low-intermediate risk"" OPC who would be eligible for current trials (eg, ECOG 3311, NRG HN002, CRUK PATHOS)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective pooled analysis combined data from 3 single-institution clinical trials for advanced-stage head and neck carcinoma. Inclusion criteria were clinical stage III/IV OPC (T1-2/N1-2b, T3/N0-2b) treated with definitive split-field IMRT and prospectively collected MDADI at baseline and at least 1 posttreatment interval available in trial databases. Patients were sampled to represent likely human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated disease (HPV+/p16+ or <10 pack-years if HPV/p16 unknown). The MDADI composite scores were collected at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment. Pairwise tests were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons., RESULTS: Forty-six patients were included. All received bilateral neck irradiation with a median dose of 70 Gy and systemic therapy (57% concurrent, 43% induction only). Overall the mean baseline MDADI composite score was 90.1, dropping to 74.6 at 6 months (P<.0001) and rising to 78.5 (P<.0001) and 83.1 (P=.002) by 12 and 24 months relative to baseline, respectively, representing a clinically meaningful drop in MDADI scores at 6 months that partially recovers by 24 months (6 vs 24 months, P=.05). Poor MDADI scores (composite <60) were reported in 4%, 11%, 15%, and 9% of patients at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Fifteen percent of patients had a persistently depressed composite score by at least 20 points at the 24-month interval., CONCLUSION: ""Low-intermediate risk"" patients with OPC treated with laryngeal/esophageal inlet dose-optimized split-field IMRT are highly likely to report recovery of acceptable swallowing function in long-term follow-up. Only 15% report poor swallowing function and/or persistently depressed MDADI at 12 months or more after IMRT. These data serve as a benchmark future trial design and endpoint interpretation.

619,"Retrospective assessment of self-reported exposure to medical ionizing radiation: results of a feasibility study conducted in Germany BACKGROUND: Exposure to medical ionizing radiation has been increasing over the past decades and constitutes the largest contributor to overall radiation exposure in the general population. While occupational exposures are generally monitored by national radiation protection agencies, individual data on medical radiation exposure for the general public are not regularly collected. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of assessing lifetime medical ionizing radiation exposure from diagnostic and therapeutic procedures retrospectively and prospectively within the framework of the German National Cohort study., METHODS: Retrospective assessment of individual medical radiation exposure was done using an interviewer-based questionnaire among 199 participants (87 men and 112 women) aged 20-69 randomly drawn from the general population at two recruitment locations in Germany. X-ray cards were distributed to 97 participants at one recruitment center to prospectively collect medical radiation exposure over a 6-month period. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to test differences in self-reported median examination frequencies for the variables age, sex, and recruitment center. To evaluate the self-reported information on radiological procedures, agreement was assessed using health insurance data as gold standard for the time period 2005 to 2010 from 8 participants., RESULTS: Participants reported a median of 7 lifetime X-ray examinations (interquartile range 4-13), and 42% (n = 83) reported having had a CT scan (2, IQR = 1-3). Women reported statistically significant more X-ray examinations than men. Individual frequencies above the 75th percentile (>=15 X-ray examinations) were predominantly observed among women and in individuals >50 years of age. The prospective exposure assessment yielded a 60% return-rate of X-ray cards (n = 58). 16 (28%) of the returned cards reported radiological examinations conducted during the 6-month period but generally lacked more detailed exposure information. X-ray examinations reported for the period for which health insurance data were available provided a moderately valid measure of individual medical radiation exposure., CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of more recent medical examinations seems in the German National Cohort study feasible, whereas lifetime medical radiation exposure appears difficult to assess via self-reports. Health insurance data may be a potentially useful tool for the assessment of individual data on medical radiation exposure both retrospectively and prospectively.",Excluded,0.5686615

Retrospective review of data from patients with MTC, diagnosed from June 1, 1970, through December 31, 2007. Overall survival and locoregional tumor control rates were calculated. Seventeen patients had adjuvant or palliative EBRT delivered to 41 sites. Six patients initially had adjuvant EBRT (median, 60.80 Gy); none had relapse in the treated area. Five patients with locoregional recurrence after surgery were treated (median, 59.40 Gy), and durable disease control was achieved in 3. Twelve patients received palliative EBRT to 29 sites of metastatic disease (median, 30.00 Gy), which provided sustained symptom relief at 45% of sites. Five- and tenyear overall survival rates were 44% and 19%, respectively. Adjuvant EBRT may be most effective for prevention of locoregional recurrence.

879,"Treatment of idiopathic hemifacial spasm with radiosurgery or hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy: Preliminary results Introduction: Microvascular decompression in the posterior cranial fossa is the first treatment option for hemifacial spasm. For patients not suitable for surgery because of advanced age, poor general conditions or patients who refuse surgery, radiotherapeutic treatment could be an alternative. Only one case of resolution of hemifacial spasm in a patient undergoing radiosurgery for an intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma has been described in the literature. In this article we present three patients affected by idiopathic hemifacial spasm, refractory to medical therapy and botulinum toxin injections, who were treated by radiosurgery in one case and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy in the other two. Method(s): Radiosurgery, with a single dose of 8Gy, was used in the first patient affected by idiopathic hemifacial spasm and autoimmune polyneuropathy with severe hypoacusia; hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, with 15Gy in 5 fractions of 3Gy each, was preferred in the other 2 cases. In all patients, the target consisted of the vestibulocochlear-facial bundle immediately before its entry into the internal acoustic foramen. Result(s): A marked improvement of symptoms was observed in 2 patients, and almost complete disappearance in the other case, with no complications, particularly, auditory. Conclusion(s): The mean follow-up time of 24 months reported here could be judged too short, and our series too small, but the good results observed so far lead us to underline that, as in trigeminal neuralgia, radiosurgery or hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy could represent a therapeutic alternative to microvascular decompression for idiopathic hemifacial spasm for patients not suitable for surgery. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

794,"Cardiac exposure in the dynamic conformal arc therapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy of lung cancer Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate the cardiac exposure in three cohorts of lung cancer patients treated with dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCAT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), or volumetricmodulated arc therapy (VMAT) at our institution in the past seven years. Methods and Materials: A total of 140 lung cancer patients were included in this institutional review board approved study: 25 treated with DCAT, 70 with IMRT and 45 with VMAT. All plans were generated in a same commercial treatment planning system and have been clinically accepted and delivered. The dose distribution to the heart and the effects of tumor laterality, the irradiated heart volume and the beam-to-heart distance on the cardiac exposure were investigated. Result(s): The mean dose to the heart among all 140 plans was 4.5 Gy. Specifically, the heart received on average 2.3, 5.2 and 4.6 Gy in the DCAT, IMRT and VMAT plans, respectively. The mean heart doses for the left and right lung tumors were 4.1 and 4.8 Gy, respectively. No patients died with evidence of cardiac disease. Three patients (2%) with preexisting cardiac condition developed cardiac disease after treatment. Furthermore, the cardiac exposure was found to increase linearly with the irradiated heart volume while decreasing exponentially with the beam-to-heart distance. Conclusion(s): Compared to old technologies for lung cancer treatment, modern radiotherapy treatment modalities demonstrated better heart sparing. But the heart dose in lung cancer radiotherapy is still higher than that in the radiotherapy of breast cancer and Hodgkin's disease where cardiac complications have been extensively studied. With strong correlations of mean heart dose with beam-to-heart distance and irradiated heart volume, cautions should be exercised to avoid long-term cardiac toxicity in the lung cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.Copyright © 2015 Ming et al.

295,"Evaluating radiation-induced white matter changes in patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery using diffusion tensor imaging: A pilot study Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been an effective treatment method for brain tumors; however, few data are available regarding radiation-induced white matter (WM) damage by SRS. In this work, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to investigate WM changes following SRS. Fifteen patients with gliomas were enrolled, with prescription doses ranging 18-25 Gy. Patients were scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including DTI before and after SRS. Diffusion tensors were calculated and fiber tracking was performed. Non-irradiated WM volumes and irradiated WM volumes receiving >=12 Gy and >=5 Gy were contoured as volumes of interest (VOI). Apparent diffusion coefficient (), fractional anisotropy (FA) and number of fibers (NF) were calculated and assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Compared with those of non-irradiated VOIs, FA and NF decreased considerably after two months of SRS in the irradiated WM VOIs. The variation in was however small and was not statistically significant. The preliminary results suggested that FA and NF might potentially be more sensitive indicators than in measuring radiation-induced WM changes and DTI could be a valuable tool to assess radiation-induced WM changes in SRS. Although it is still preliminary, this pilot study may be useful to provide insights for future studies. © Adenine Press (2014).",Excluded,0.54953045
1021,"FANCD2 depletion sensitizes cancer cells repopulation ability in vitro Inactivation of Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway in some cancers causes increased sensitivity to various drugs used for chemo-therapy. Several approaches have been suggested to artificially disrupt this pathway for better treatment. In our study, we have utilized RNA interference technique to knock-down the expression of FANCD2 and sensitize cancer cells undergoing treatment with DNA damaging agents. For this purpose, we transiently depleted FANCD2 by siRNA in a number of breast, bladder, or liver cancer cell lines and screened for mitomycin C or gamma-irradiation sensitivity changes. We could show that knocking-down FANCD2 gene expression increases sensitivity of cancer cells to mitomycin C and to less extent to gamma-rays. Importantly, this effect strongly correlates to repopulation ability of cancer cells and those cell lines with significant FANCD2 depletion revealed decreased recurrence capacity. In summary, the results we presented show proof of principle that opens new possibilities for further preclinical trials.",Excluded,0.54862326
381,"Radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy after definitive radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Clinical predictors and dose-toxicity relationship BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy is a debilitating and irreversible late complication after definitive radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and other skull base tumors. This study sets to evaluate its incidence and clinical predictive factors, and to propose relevant dosimetric constraints for this structure to guide radiotherapy planning., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook a retrospective review of 797 NPC patients who underwent definitive intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) between 2003 and 2011. Cumulative incidence and clinical predictors for radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy were evaluated. Archived radiotherapy plans were retrieved and 330 independent hypoglossal nerves were retrospectively contoured following standardized atlas. Optimal threshold analyses of dosimetric parameters (Dmax, D0.5cc, D1cc, D2cc, Dmean) were conducted using receiver operating characteristic curves. Normal tissue complication probability was generated with logistic regression modeling., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 8.1years, sixty-nine (8.7%) patients developed radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy. High radiotherapy dose, premorbid diabetes, advanced T-stage and radiological hypoglossal canal involvement were independent clinical risk factors. Maximum dose received by 1cc volume (D1cc) was the best predictor for the development of radiation-induced nerve palsy (AUC=0.826) at 8years after IMRT. Hypoglossal nerves with D1cc of 74Gy EQD2 had an estimated palsy risk of 4.7%. Nerves with D1cc <74Gy EQD2 had significantly lower risk of palsy than those >=74Gy EQD2 (2.4% vs 20.8%, p <0.001)., CONCLUSION: Incidence of radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy was high after definitive IMRT for NPC. D1cc <74Gy EQD2 can serve as a useful dose constraint to adopt during radiotherapy planning to limit palsy risk to <5% at 8years after IMRT. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

610,"Work history and radioprotection practices in relation to cancer incidence and mortality in US radiologic technologists performing nuclear medicine procedures Introduction Technologists working in nuclear medicine (NM) are exposed to higher radiation doses than most other occupationally exposed populations. The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of cancer in NM technologists in relation to work history, procedures performed and radioprotection practices. Methods From the US Radiologic Technologists cohort study, 72 755 radiologic technologists who completed a 2003-2005 questionnaire were followed for cancer mortality through 31 December 2012 and for cancer incidence through completion of a questionnaire in 2012-2013. Multivariable-adjusted models were used to estimate HRs for total cancer incidence and mortality by history of ever performing NM procedures and frequency of performing specific diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and associated radiation protection measures by decade. Results During follow-up (mean=7.5 years), 960 incident cancers and 425 cancer deaths were reported among the 22 360 technologists who worked with NM procedures. We observed no increased risk of cancer incidence (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04) or death (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.19) among workers who ever performed NM procedures. HRs for cancer incidence but not mortality were higher for technologists who began performing therapeutic procedures in 1960 and later compared with the 1950s. Frequency of performing diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and use of radioprotection measures were not consistently associated with cancer risk. No clear associations were observed for specific cancers, but results were based on small numbers. Conclusion Cancer incidence and mortality were not associated with NM work history practices, including greater frequency of procedures performed.Copyright © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

All patients were treated in a prone position on a bellyboard by 3DRT. The inferior border of the RT fields was at least 3-5 cm inferior to the gross tumorous volume (GTV) or at the inferior border of the obturator foramen (IBOF), whichever was more inferior. The EAS was contoured and dose distributions were determined using dose-volume histograms., RESULTS: In 53 out of 64 cases (82.8%), the EAS was completely inferior to the IBOF. In the remaining 11 cases, the EAS was either overlapping the IBOF (10 cases; 15.6%) or completely superior to the IBOF (1 case; 1.7%). The average mean dose delivered to the EAS was 2795 cGy. Lower mean doses were delivered to the EAS when the center of the EAS was located more distant from the GTV., CONCLUSIONS: Meticulous planning to define the inferior border of the RT field is recommended to avoid irradiating the EAS.",Excluded,0.53533846
782,"Establishing locoregional control of malignant pleural mesothelioma using high-dose radiotherapy and 18F-FDG PET/CT scan correlation Introduction: The management of malignant pleural mesothelioma represents one of the most challenging issues in oncology, as there is no proven long-term benefit from surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone or in combination. Locoregional progression remains the major cause of death, but radical surgical resection may produce major postoperative morbidity. While radical or postoperative radiotherapy using conventional techniques has resulted in severe toxicity with no impact on survival, recent advances in radiotherapy delivery may be more effective. Method(s): We treated patients with locally advanced mesothelioma whose tumours had been sub optimally resected with high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to large volumes of one hemithorax, using CT and positron emission tomography (PET) scan-based treatment planning. Clinical outcomes were assessed by determining patterns of failure and metabolic changes in total glycolytic volume (TGV) between pre- and post-irradiation18F-FDG PET/CT scans and by recording acute and late toxicity grades. Result(s): Fourteen patients were analysed with 40 PET scans performed before and up to 4.5 years after radiotherapy. Eleven patients had pleurectomy/decortications, one had an extrapleural pneumonectomy and two had no surgery. Four patients who received chemotherapy had all progressed prior to radiotherapy. After radiotherapy, the in-field local control rate was 71%. No progression occurred in two patients, one was salvaged with further radiotherapy to a new site, four recurred inside the irradiated volume all with concurrent distant metastases and the other seven had distant metastases only. The TGVs were reduced by an average of 67% (range 12-100%) after doses of 45 to 60 Gy to part or all of one hemithorax. There were no serious treatment-related toxicities. Median survival was 25 months from diagnosis and 17 months after starting radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): We have established that mesothelioma can be locally controlled with high radiation doses using 3DCRT or IMRT, and that strict normal tissue dose constraints have limited radiation toxicities. Radiotherapy should be considered to prevent or delay the local manifestations of progressive disease in suitable patients after surgery including extrapleural pneumonectomy and pleurectomy/decortication. Higher radiation doses may allow more effective palliation. © 2011 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.",Excluded,0.5334303
661,"Baseline MAPK signaling activity confers intrinsic radioresistance to KRAS-mutant colorectal carcinoma cells by rapid upregulation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) is overexpressed in malignant tumors and involved in DNA damage response upon ionizing radiation (IR). Here, we investigate its role in radioresistance of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and evaluate a pharmacological approach to enhance CRC radiosensitivity via downregulation of hnRNP K. We show that hnRNP K is overexpressed in CRC tissue specimens and upregulated in response to IR in vitro, which occurs faster in KRAS-mutant CRC cells. HnRNP K knockdown impairs cell survival, cell cycle progression and KRAS-dependent radioresistance and increases apoptosis. Using the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay, a decrease in xenograft tumor growth and radioresistance upon hnRNP K depletion could be verified in vivo, and comparable effects were achieved by suppression of hnRNP K expression using the MEK inhibitor MEK162 (Binimetinib). In summary, KRAS-mutant CRC shows intrinsic radioresistance along with rapid upregulation of hnRNP K in response to IR that can effectively be targeted by MEK inhibition. Our results point towards a possible use of MAPK pathway inhibitors to decrease radioresistance of KRAS-mutant CRC via downregulation of hnRNP K.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded,0.5332461
1155,"Is it possible to avoid hypopituitarism after the irradiation of pituitary adenomas by the Leksell gamma-knife? Radiation therapy is used in the treatment of pituitary adenomas, especially in failures of neurosurgery and pharmacotherapy to reduce the size of adenomas and normalize their hypersecretion. Conventional fractionated radiotherapy has achieved good results, but only after a long latency, with considerable postradiation morbidity and with very frequent appearance of hypopituitarism. The focal stereotactic targeting allowed by Leksell gamma-knife (LGK) was supposed to decrease the incidence of hypopituitarism, however our first patients treated by LGK developed hypopituitarism in 38.2%. Consequently, we have analyzed factors leading to this unfavorable outcome and suggested that the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary tissue is the most important cause of hypopituitarism. Result(s): Seventy-five patients (47 women and 28 men) with pituitary adenomas (39 with acromegaly, 17 prolactinomas, 8 with Cushing's disease, 1 with Nelson's syndrome and 9 functionless adenomas), where the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary tissue was measured, were followed 60-180 (mean 91.1) months. In 41 patients, the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary was more than 15 Gy. The hypopituitarism at least in one axis developed in 29 (70.7%) patients during 10-126 months after the irradiation. In 34 patients, the mean dose on pituitary was less than 15 Gy. Only one patient (1.2%) developed hypopituitarism 12 months after the irradiation. This patient had undergone two previous pituitary surgeries and had already central hypothyreosis when irradiated. Conclusion(s): To avoid hypopituitarism the radiation dose of 15 Gy is the maximum safe limit of the mean dose of radiation to the pituitary tissue surrounding the adenoma. This cut off should become a rule when irradiating pituitary adenomas - just like the dose rules of 7 Gy on the optical tract or 14 Gy on the brainstem.",Excluded,0.5204617

We report on outcome after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) in correlation with patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We analyzed 69 patients treated between 2000 and 2019. FSRT was delivered with a median total dose of 54 Gy (single fraction: 1.8 Gy). PRO questionnaires were sent to 28 patients. Median overall survival was 17.2 years; mean local control was 15.6 years (median not reached). Median follow-up was 5.8 years. Twenty (71%) patients participated in the PRO assessment. Physicians reported symptoms grade >=3 in 6 cases (9%). Of all, 35 (51%) patients suffered from hypopituitarism at baseline, and during follow-up, new or progressive hypopituitarism was observed in 11 cases (16%). Patients reported 10 cases of severe side effects. Most of these symptoms were already graded as CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) grade 2 by a physician in a previous follow-up exam. PROs are an essential measure and only correlate to a certain extent with the physician-reported outcomes. For high-precision radiotherapy of pituitary adenomas, they confirm excellent overall outcomes and low toxicity. In the future, the integration of PROs paired with high-end treatment will further improve outcomes.Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded,0.5198953

250,"Long-term hearing outcomes following stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma: Patterns of hearing loss and variables influencing audiometric decline Object. The goals of this retrospective cohort study were as follows: 1) to describe the long-term prevalence and timing of hearing deterioration following low-dose (12- to 13-Gy marginal dose) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for vestibular schwannoma (VS); and 2) to identify clinical variables associated with long-term preservation of useful hearing following treatment. Methods. Patients with serviceable hearing who underwent SRS for VS between 1997 and 2002 were studied. Data including radiosurgery treatment plans, tumor characteristics, pre- and posttreatment pure tone average, speech discrimination scores, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery hearing class were collected. Time to nonserviceable hearing was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate associations with time to nonserviceable hearing were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results. Forty-four patients met the study criteria and were included. The median duration of audiometric follow- up was 9.3 years. Thirty-six patients developed nonserviceable hearing at a mean of 4.2 years following SRS. The Kaplan-Meier estimated rates of serviceable hearing at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years following SRS were 80%, 55%, 48%, 38%, and 23%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that pretreatment ipsilateral pure tone average (p < 0.001) and tumor size (p = 0.009) were statistically significantly associated with time to nonserviceable hearing. Conclusions. Durable hearing preservation a decade after low-dose SRS for VS occurs in less than one-fourth of patients. Variables including preoperative hearing capacity and tumor size may be used to predict hearing outcomes following treatment. These findings may assist in pretreatment risk disclosure. Furthermore, these data demonstrate the importance of long-term follow-up when reporting audiometric outcomes following SRS for VS. © AANS, 2013.",Excluded,0.51543754

In the liver, an area of low attenuation corresponding to the radiation port (or an area of hyperattenuation if the underlying liver tissue shows fatty change) can be seen at computed tomography (CT) performed within 3-6 months after therapy. Later, the liver may be fibrotic and contracted. In the stomach, small intestine, and colon, wall thickening and edema are early manifestations. Ulcers may also be observed. Long-term complications include strictures and fistulas. After irradiation of the kidneys, altered attenuation of the renal parenchyma may be seen at CT. Ureteral strictures, typically involving the distal ureter, may be observed after pelvic irradiation. The bladder may be small and contracted with a thickened wall after radiation exposure.

We have combined mutations in factors from both repair pathways, the HR protein Rad54 and the DNA-end-binding factor Ku80, which has a role in NHEJ. Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) mice were severely compromised in their survival, such that fewer double mutants were born than expected, and only a small proportion of those born reached adulthood. However, double-mutant mice died at lower frequency from tumors than Ku80 single mutant mice, likely as a result of rapid demise at a young age from other causes. When challenged with an exogenous DNA damaging agent, ionizing radiation, double-mutant mice were exquisitely sensitive to low doses. Tissues and cells from double-mutant mice also showed indications of spontaneous DNA damage. Testes from some Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) mice displayed enhanced apoptosis and reduced sperm production, and embryonic fibroblasts from Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) animals accumulated foci of gamma-H2AX, a marker for DSBs. The substantially increased DNA damage response in the double mutants implies a cooperation of the two DSB repair pathways for survival and genomic integrity in the animal.",Excluded,0.51118493
330,"High expression of Rad51c predicts poor prognostic outcome and induces cell resistance to cisplatin and radiation in non-small cell lung cancer Rad51c is critical for homologous recombination repair and genomic stability and may play roles in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy. We investigated the expression level and clinical significance of Rad51c in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and determined the effect of Rad51c on NSCLC cell chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity. Rad51c expression was detected using immunohistochemistry and was higher in NSCLC patient samples than in adjacent normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high Rad51c expression was an independent predictor of short overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in NSCLC patients receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Furthermore, Rad51c knockdown increased the killing effect of ionizing radiation (IR) and enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptotic cells in NSCLC cells by disrupting the repair of cisplatin- and IR-induced DNA damage. In addition, ectopic expression of Rad51c dramatically enhanced NSCLC cell resistance to cisplatin and radiotherapy. These findings suggest that increased expression of Rad51c may confer resistance to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy of NSCLC, and also be an independent prognostic factor for patient outcome. Therefore, targeting Rad51c may represent an improved therapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients with locally advanced disease.Copyright © 2016, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).",Excluded,0.5048128
235,"Investigation of different combinations of estrogen therapy and radiation therapy on prostatic adenocarcinoma (R-3327) The relative effectiveness of different combinations of estrogen therapy and radiation therapy against the R-3327 prostatic adenocarcinoma of the Copenhagen rat was studied. Because of similar actions of estrogens and radiation in the cell cycle, and possibly antagonistic effects reported in the clinical literature, we looked for an antagonism between these two therapeutic modalities. Radiation therapy consistently showed a greater tumor inhibitory effect than estrogen therapy alone at the dose tested. Combinations of radiation therapy with hormonal manipulation did not appear to show a greater inhibition of tumor growth than radiation therapy alone. There also did not appear to be an antagonistic effect between these two modalities in this system.",Excluded,0.50433123
582,"Effect of wide-band modulated electromagnetic fields on the workers of high-frequency telephone exchanges Physiological examinations of 63 subjects were performed as well as clinical, functional, paraclinical, etc. examinations of 82 subjects working under the effect of wide-band modulated electromagnetic fields in HFA of telephone exchanges. Some physiological changes were found as regards the level of blood pressure and auditory threshold. Though the intensity of EMF were within the allowable limits, changes in the neuro-vegetological state, genital sphere, were found in some of the examined workers as well as in immunologic reactivity and some paraclinical indices, described to develop under electromagnetic effect, attributed to the specificity of EMF-wide-band, modulated.",Excluded,0.50403583
