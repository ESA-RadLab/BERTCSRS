4268,"De Novo Development of Moyamoya Disease after Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Arteriovenous Malformation in a Patient With RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys (rs112735431) BACKGROUND: Reports of cases diagnosed as Moyamoya disease (MMD) after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are extremely rare. In recent years, ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) has been identified as a susceptibility gene of MMD, but the mechanism by which MMD develops remains unclear. Those cases of de novo development of MMD may provide some clues to clarify the mechanism of progression of MMD.CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of de novo MMD that developed after SRS for AVM. This patient presented with a variant of the RNF213 gene. The intracranial internal carotid artery was not within the irradiation field; therefore it was obvious that the development of MMD was not caused by the direct effect of radiation in the current case study. Moreover, we demonstrated the decrease in velocity in the internal carotid artery prior to the development of MMD using phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography. Previous studies demonstrated that progression of the pathological condition in the cerebral arteries in response to hemodynamic changes is enhanced in patients with RNF213 variants.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the changes in the intracranial hemodynamics after SRS for AVM could trigger the de novo onset of MMD in patients with a genetic predisposition for the RNF213 variant.",Excluded
4383,"Feasibility of dose escalation using intraoperative radiotherapy following resection of large brain metastases compared to post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Post-operative SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery) for large brain metastases is challenged by risks of radiation necrosis that limit SRS dose. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a potential alternative, however standard dose recommendations are lacking.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty consecutive brain metastases treated with post-operative SRS were retrospectively compared to IORT plans generated for 10-30 Gy in 1 fraction to 0-5 mm by estimating the applicator size and distance from critical organs using pre-operative and post-operative MRI. Additionally, 7 consecutive patients treated with IORT 30 Gy to surface were compared to retrospectively generated SRS plans using the post-operative MRI to 15-20 Gy and 30 Gy in 1 fraction marginal dose.RESULTS: For the 20 resection cavities treated with SRS and retrospectively compared to IORT, IORT from 10 to 30Gy resulted in lower or not significantly different doses to the optic apparatus and brainstem. Comparatively for the 7 patients treated with IORT 30 Gy to retrospective SRS plans to standard 15-20 Gy and 30 Gy marginal dose, IORT resulted in significantly lower doses to the optic apparatus and brainstem. At a median follow-up of 6.2 months, 86% of patients treated with surgery and IORT achieved local control and 0% developed radiographic or symptomatic radiation necrosis.CONCLUSIONS: Critical organ dosimetry for IORT remains generally lower than that achieved with single fraction SRS following resection of large brain metastases. We recommend 30 Gy to surface as the preferred prescription, consistent with the dose recommendation for IORT in glioblastoma used in the ongoing INTRAGO-II phase-III trial. Early clinical outcomes appear promising for surgery and IORT.",Excluded
4222,"High dietary iron increases oxidative stress and radiosensitivity in the rat retina and vasculature after exposure to fractionated gamma radiation Radiation exposure in combination with other space environmental factors including microgravity, nutritional status, and deconditioning is a concern for long-duration space exploration missions. Astronauts experience altered iron homeostasis due to adaptations to microgravity and an iron-rich food system. Iron intake reaches three to six times the recommended daily allowance due to the use of fortified foods on the International Space Station. Iron is associated with certain optic neuropathies and can potentiate oxidative stress. This study examined the response of eye and vascular tissue to gamma radiation exposure (3 Gy fractionated at 37.5 cGy per day every other day for 8 fractions) in rats fed an adequate-iron diet or a high-iron diet. Twelve-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of four experimental groups: adequate-iron diet/no radiation (CON), high-iron diet/no radiation (IRON), adequate-iron diet/radiation (RAD), and high-iron diet/radiation (IRON+RAD). Animals were maintained on the corresponding iron diet for 2 weeks before radiation exposure. As previously published, the high-iron diet resulted in elevated blood and liver iron levels. Dietary iron overload altered the radiation response observed in serum analytes, as evidenced by a significant increase in catalase levels and smaller decrease in glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity levels. 8-OHdG immunostaining, showed increased intensity in the retina after radiation exposure. Gene expression profiles of retinal and aortic vascular samples suggested an interaction between the response to radiation and high dietary iron. This study suggests that the combination of gamma radiation and high dietary iron has deleterious effects on retinal and vascular health and physiology.",Included
4553,"Pituitary metastasis from renal cell carcinoma: Description of a case report Objective: Rare disease Background: Pituitary metastasis is uncommon, breast and lung cancers being the most frequent primary tumors. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a rare cause of pituitary metastases, with only a few cases described to date. Case Report: We report a case of a 61-year-old man who presented with a progressive deterioration of visual acuity and field associated with a bitemporal hemianopsia. Two years ago, he underwent radical right nephrectomy for a clear cell RCC (ccRCC). The biological tests showed pan-hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus. Brain MRI revealed a large sellar tumor lesion bilaterally infiltrating the cavernous sinuses, which was surgically resected. Histology confirmed a ccRCC pituitary metastasis. The patient received post-surgical radiotherapy. Considering the presence of concomitant extra-pituitary metastases, treatment with sunitinib was started, followed by several lines of therapy with axitinib, everolimus, and sorafenib because of tumor progression. The patient also presented with a pituitary tumor recurrence, which was treated by stereotaxic radiotherapy. He died five years after the initial diagnosis of RCC and 30 months after the diagnosis of the pituitary metastasis. Conclusion(s): There are no standardized treatment guidelines for management of pituitary metastases. Pituitary surgery plays a role in symptom palliation, and it does not have any relevant impact on survival. Exclusive radiotherapy or stereotaxic radiotherapy could be an alternative to surgery in patients whose general condition is poor or who have concomitant extra-pituitary metastases.

4360,"Radiation target delineation of micro brain arteriovenous malformations using highresolution flat-detector cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) Purpose Radiation therapy has shown to be an effective treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs).1 2 Target delineation is commonly performed on volumetric image data, such as MRI or CT data. However, the nidi of micro-AVMs may not be visualized adequately by these modalities due to their limited image resolution. In this report, we show a novel usage of high-resolution contrastenhanced cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging and multi-modal image registration<sup>3</sup> for radiation target delineation of a micro-AVM, a technique previously suggested for larger AVMs.4 Case A 42-year-old male presented with intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the mesencephalic tectum and left posterior thalamus. Conventional angiography revealed a left superior collicular AVM with a nidus of 3mm. The AVM was successfully embolized but follow-up angiography examinations at 36 months demonstrated a small re-growth of the AVM (Abstract P-017 figure 1A). The patient was thus referred to radiosurgery. Thin slice contrast and non-contrast MRI acquired for target delineation did not show the AVM nidus. Therefore, the patient was transferred to the angiography suite for high resolution contrast-enhanced CBCT. Data was acquired using the angiography c-arm system with a reduced detector size of 22 cm. Contrast was injected with 2 ml/s for a total of 64 ml and a 2 sec delay) using a coupled power injector into the left vertebral artery with a 5Fr catheter. Volumetric CBCT data (FOV: 70<sup>3</sup>mm<sup>3</sup>, matrix: 0.14<sup>3</sup>mm<sup>3</sup>) was generated using a nonbinned reconstruction algorithm. Lesion and nidus were visualized with CBCT. MRI, CT-simulator and CBCT data was then transferred to the radiation planning software and mutually co-registered. The nidus was delineated on CBCT data by an experienced neurointerventional radiologist for radiation therapy and dose/ treatment plan was completed. Due to image registration, the target area could be directly transferred to MRI and CT data (Abstract P-0017 figure 1B). The patient received a total of 4 radiation sessions. Discussion and Conclusion Radiation target delineation of micro AVMs can be challenging with conventional 3D imaging techniques as their spatial resolution is relatively low for the application of visualization of the nidus. We were able to demonstrate the complementary value of high resolution contrast enhanced CBCT in radiation target delineation of a micro brain AVM. Multi-modal image registration of CBCTwith MRI and CT-simulator has shown to be an effective method for radiation target delineation. (Figure presented).",Excluded
4121,"Re-irradiation with hypo-fractionated stereotactic robotic radiotherapy for salvage in adult patients with brainstem glioma PURPOSE: Brainstem glioma (BSG) is often treated with definitive irradiation. However, subsequent progression and death occur as a rule rather than the exception, after varying periods of control. The outlook of patients with post-irradiation progression is dismal, and most of these patients are treated with supportive care alone. Despite the obvious risks with an area as critical as the brainstem, it is a possibility to encounter situations wherein the patients (themselves or their associates) ask for re-irradiation, with the hope of a few extra months of life. The risk of radiation-induced brainstem toxicity may be justifiable under the strict assumption that the patients stand a chance of benefiting from re-irradiation but still may not live long enough to manifest brainstem toxicity.METHODS: Five adult BSG patients were treated with re-irradiation using robotic-arm stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) between September 2009 and July 2012, primarily at the request of the concerned patient parties. Re-irradiation doses ranged from 16 to 25 Gray (Gy) delivered by robotic arm stereotactic irradiation in 2-5 fractions.RESULTS: Four out of five patients enjoyed a prolongation of survival in the order of months (three, five, six, and 14 months), which was very significant given that all patients had severe neurological compromise and poor performance status prior to re-irradiation. One patient has survived 36 months after re-irradiation and thus has lived long enough to manifest late radiation-induced brainstem toxicity.CONCLUSION: Despite the obvious risks of brainstem toxicity associated with the use of re-irradiation for BSG, the use of fractionated stereotactic re-irradiation seems to offers prospects of additional periods of local control and augments duration of life.",Excluded
4669,"Outcomes of cyberknife stereotactic treatment in a small cohort of advanced unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients Background: Cyberknife stereotactic treatment is a precisely targeted radiation to a tumor while minimizing injury to adjacent normal tissue, with well-established indication in intracranial tumors. The role of cyberknife treatment in advanced unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients is still in evolution and needs more focus. Aim(s): To evaluate survival and other outcomes of cyberknife treatment in a cohort of advanced pancreatic carcinoma patients. Method(s): This is a retrospective data review of all advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients with poor prognosis who are not amenable for any kind of treatment from August 2010 to December 2012. Patients' demographics, date of diagnosis, location and size of the cancer, duration and dose of cyberknife treatment and date of death of all pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients were collected. Kaplan Meier survival curves were used to calculate the mean and median survival times for the overall cohort. The log rank test was used to compare survival by lesion size ( >=3 cm versus < 3cm). Result(s): Our cohort consisted of 17 patients with advanced unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent cyberknife treatment. Age at diagnosis ranged from 49 - 90 years with a mean of 75.2 +/- 12.9 years and eight patients (50%) were males. Tumor size ranged from 0.6 - 6.0 cm with an average size of 2.6 +/- 1.4 cm. Cyberknife treatment dose ranged from 2500 - 5400 cGy (centi Gray units) with a mean dose of 3671.8 +/- 918.0 cGy. The mean survival time for the entire cohort was 29.7 +/- 5.9 months and median survival time was 25.1 +/- 8.4 months (Figure 1), when compared to published literature of 6 - 8 months survival in advanced pancreatic carcinoma patients. Although statistically not significant, mean survival of patients with tumor size < 3cm was more than a year longer in comparison with tumor size of >= 3 cm (33.9 +/- 5.5 versus 20.4 +/- 9.5 months, p = 0.123) (Figure 2). GI bleed was observed in two patients (11.8%) and no other significant complications were noted in the rest. Conclusion(s): Results demonstrated an increase in the overall survival of advanced pancreatic carcinoma patients with cyberknife treatment when compared to published literature. This analysis was based on a small sample size and should be replicated with larger databases. (Figure presented).",Excluded
4507,"Treatment of brain radiation necrosis with mouse-nerve growth factor: A phase II trial Purpose/Objective(s): To conduct a prospective phase II trial of mouse-Nerve Growth Factor (mNGF) for the treatment of symptomatic radiation induced brain necrosis. Materials/Methods: A total of 10 patients were entered into this phase II study of mNGF for the treatment of symptomatic temporal lobe radiation necrosis. All patients had undergone definitive radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) years before, and were required to have radiographic or biopsy proved temporal lobe radiation necrosis and progressive neurologic symptoms or signs. mNGF was dissolved in 2ml normal saline, and then injected intramuscularly at 18mg/time, once a day for 2 months. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings at 3 - 4 weeks after the use of mNGF and clinical signs and symptoms defined the response or progression. Result(s): The only side effect observed was mild pain at the injection site in 2 patients. The volumes of necrosis estimated on T1- weighted gadolinium- enhanced MRI scans demonstrated that 2 patients achieved complete response, 5patients achieved partial response, and 3 patients did not respond. The neurologic symptoms or signs disappeared completely in 4 patients, improved in 4 patients, and had no change in 2 patients. Conclusion(s): This phase II trial demonstrated that the mNGF is effective for the treatment of temporal lobe radiation necrosis with minimal side effects. Prospective placebo controlled randomized study is justified to test further its routine use for people with radiation induced temporal lobe necrosis.",Excluded
4224,"[Histochemical and ultrastructural studies on anti-edematous and radiation-protective action of 0-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-rutosides on the rat brain after single irradiation. 2. Histochemical study on carbohydrate metabolism and acid phosphatase activation] The disturbances of the carbohydrate metabolism and the activation of acid phosphatases with and without protection by O-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-rutoside (HR) were studied in irradiated rat brains by means of the light microscope. The histochemically demonstrable deposition of glycogen and acid mucopolysaccharides serves as a criterion for a reversible lesion of the irradiated cerebral tissue. The extent of local activation of repair processes following to irradiation can be determined by the quantity of acid phosphatases in the lysosomes. For the dose range of 1 to 5 Gy, HR seems to exert a protective effect on the cellular metabolism of the irradiated cerebral tissue shown by a slight decrease of glycogen and mucopolysaccharide deposits compared to the untreated animals. However, when exceeding a threshold dose of 10 Gy, the deposition of carbohydrates in the HR group is strongly increased. A slightly increased activity of acid phosphatases induced by HR can be supposed at best for the dose range of 5 to 7.5 Gy. If the dose is even more increased, the reverse effect found in the carbohydrate metabolism, too, and an increased activation of acid phosphatases in the control group will be observed. This unexpected reversion of the protective effect could be related to the assumed inhibitory effect of HR on the ATPases and thus on the anaerobic part of glycolysis or to a breakdown of the cell interaction system of endothelial cells, glia cells, and neurons.",Included
4142,"Diffusion measured white matter disintegration in cluster headache Objectives: In our former study we showed altered microstructure of the white matter in migraineurs. It is not known yet if these changes of MRI diffusion parameters were specific for migraine, or related to the repeated pain attacks. Method(s): 11 patients with cluster headache and 11 agematched healthy control subjects were recruited. Diffusion weighted MRI images with 60 diffusion directions were acquired on a 1.5 T GE Signa Excite scanner. Tract based spatial statistics were used to detect the integrity of white matter tracts in a skeleton representing the core of the fibre bundles. Result(s): Reduced fractional anisotropy was found in a right corticospinal tract, in the corpus callosum and in the anterior thalamic radiation bilaterally. The axial diffusivity was bilaterally increased in the anterior thalamic radiation, in the anterior corona radiate and in the inferior part of the fronto-occipital fasciculus. The mean and perpendicular diffusivity was increased almost over the whole brain with left sided dominance. Discussion(s): Since the above described white matter microstructural alterations, however more extensive, are similar to those found in migraine, this points to the assumption that these findings might reflect pain related alterations that are not specific to either of the diseases.",Excluded

4244,"Orientation-specific fast rTMS maximizes corticospinal inhibition and facilitation Specific stimulation of neuronal circuits may promote selective inhibition or facilitation of corticospinal tract excitability. Monophasic stimulation is more likely to achieve direction-specific neuronal excitation. In 10 healthy subjects, we compared four types of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), monophasic and biphasic stimuli with the initial current in the brain flowing antero-posteriorly (""posteriorly directed"") or postero-anteriorly (""anteriorly directed""). We applied rTMS over the primary motor cortex contralateral to the dominant hand, using 80 stimuli at 5 Hz frequency at an intensity yielding baseline motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes of 1 mV. Monophasic stimulation was always more efficient than biphasic. Facilitation was induced by intracerebral anteriorly directed current flow and inhibition by posteriorly oriented current flow, although only initially for approximately 30 pulses. The early inhibition was absent when studied during a tonic muscle contraction. Several mechanisms could account for these findings. They include a more efficient excitation of inhibiting circuits by posteriorly oriented pulses, and a back-propagating D-wave inhibiting early I-waves and thus inducing early inhibition of MEP amplitude. In any case biphasic rTMS results can be explained by a mixture of monophasic opposite stimulations. We propose the use of monophasic pulses for maximizing effects during rTMS.",Excluded
4162,"Lifetime risk of stroke and impact of hypertension: estimates from the adult health study in Hiroshima and Nagasaki Very few reports have been published on lifetime risk (LTR) of stroke by blood pressure (BP) group. This study included participants in the Radiation Effects Research Foundation Adult Health Study who have been followed up by biennial health examinations since 1958. We calculated the LTR of stroke for various BP-based groups among 7847 subjects who had not been diagnosed with stroke before the index age of 55 years using cumulative incidence analysis adjusting for competing risks. By 2003, 868 subjects had suffered stroke (512 (58.9%) were women and 542 (62.4%) experienced ischemic stroke). BP was a significant factor in determining risk of stroke for men and women, with distributions of cumulative risk for stroke significantly different across BP groups. The LTR of all-stroke for normotension (systolic BP/diastolic BP < 120/80 mm Hg), prehypertension (120-139/80-89 mm Hg), stage 1 hypertension (140-159/90-99 mm Hg) and stage 2 hypertension (> 160/100 mm Hg) were 13.8-16.9-25.8-25.8% in men and 16.0-19.9-24.0-30.5% in women, respectively (P < 0.001 among BP groups in both sexes). The estimates did not differ significantly (P = 0.16) between normotensive and prehypertensive subjects. One in five Japanese atomic bomb survivor subjects experienced stroke over their lifetime from the age of 55 years. Long-term stroke risks were elevated in those with hypertension (> 140/90 mm Hg) at any of the index ages of 45, 55, 65 and 75 years.",Included

According to our data to assess the effective-ness of special treatment of these patients is possible with such clearly defined predictors such as age, volume of surgery, initial tumor size and functional status (the Karnofsky index). The study demonstrates that in patients who underwent radiotherapy using single focal dose of 3 Gy overall survivals was comparable with the group of patients who underwent radiation therapy using small dose fractionation.

3869,"Benefits of Early Palliative Care in the Community: A Propensity Score Matched Cancer Cohort Objective: Randomized trials of early palliative care (PC) showed patient benefits. However these benefits have not been validated in community-based cohorts. The objective is to assess the impact of early vs not-early PC among cancer decedents on the risk of receiving aggressive care (ED/hospitalization), supportive care (home care/physician home visit), or hospital death. Method(s): We took a retrospective cohort of Ontario decedents between 2004 and 2014. We identified those who were 'early' PC users (i.e. used a validated PC service between month 12-6 before death [exposure]). We used propensity score matching to identify a control group of 'not-early' PC users. We hard matched on age, sex, cancer type and stage. The propensity score included region, income, year, radiation, etc. Among those with InterRAI assessments in exposure period, we additionally controlled for health instability, and dependency, depression, cognitive performance, pain, and caregiver presence via propensity score. McNemar test used to examine differences between pairs. Result(s): 51,001 decedents received early PC vs 85,979 not-early PC (i.e. late or none). After matching among those with no interRAI assessments, we found 34,184 pairs of early and not-early PC users. Both groups had equal distributions of age, sex, cancer type (e.g. 25% lung cancer) and stage (e.g. 24% stage 3 or 4). Compared to not-early PC users, early PC users had a 10% lower absolute risk to die in hospital and have any aggressive care respectively and a 24% higher absolute risk to any receive supportive care. In a mutually exclusive cohort, matching among those with interRAI assessments, we identified 3,419 pairs of early and not-early PC users. Both groups had equal scores in health instability (e.g. 12% moderate-high CHESS score) and other interRAI scales. The outcome results were similar to the non-interRAI analysis. Conclusion(s): Using propensity score matching, decedents receiving early PC are likely to receive more supportive care and less aggressive care compared to not-early PC users. Our study uniquely focuses on a population receiving community palliative care. In a distinct sample using interRAI assessments, we control for several confounders previously unmeasured.

The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of F-FDG PET/CT vs. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/MR in differentiating PD from RC in a subpopulation of malignant gliomas. METHOD(S): We evaluated 10 patients with high-grade gliomas whom had previously undergone chemoradiation therapy and developed MR evidence of PD per RANO criteria. All patients underwent <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/MR (MR attenuation correction, PET/MR<sup>AC</sup>), and conventional diagnostic MR (PET/MR<sup>D</sup>). pMR was also performed. Separate consensus blinded readings by two fellowship-trained radiologists (1 neuroradiology; 1 nuclear) were performed to assess the diagnostic efficacy of PET/CT, PET/MR<sup>AC</sup>PET/MR<sup>D</sup>. A qualitative subjective rating was given to each lesion (1 = definite RC; 2 = probable RC; 3 = equivocal; 4 = probable PD; 5 = definite PD). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were determined for the three interpretation sessions after binary reclassification, with a rating of 1-3 defined as RC and 4-5 defined as PD.

4603,"Amide proton transfer MRI of malignant gliomas for detecting active versus inactive tumor Although promising therapies are being advanced for patients with malignant gliomas, a major limitation in developing these therapies is the lack of specificity of neuro-imaging, particularly in distinguishing between tumor progression and treatment-induced injury. Amide proton transfer (APT) MRI is a protein-based molecular imaging technique that uses the water signal to detect amide protons of endogenous mobile proteins in tissue. Our prior data suggest that high APT is a typical feature of active tumor. We hypothesized here that patients with lt; 2% APT intensity after chemoradiation would have a longer progression free survival compared to patients with high APT. METHOD(S): Patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma underwent standard and APTMRimaging at 3T one month after completion of chemoradiation. Patients were followed for time to progression (defined as either pathologically confirmed active tumor post-treatment or a change in therapy based on clinical assessment of progression) as well as overall survival. RESULT(S): Nineteen subjects, 14 male, were enrolled. Eleven had glioblastoma and 8 anaplastic astrocytoma. Twelve subjects had high APT intensity (63.1%) and 7 had low/normal APT intensity. Dose of steroids at time of imaging, time from initial imaging, and dose of radiation treatment was similar between groups. All but one patient received temozolomide with radiation. Median time to progression was 122 days (range 19-488) in the high APT group and 472 days (range 47-698) in the low APT group. Median overall survival was 343 days (range 155-649) in the high APT group and 662 days (495-794) in the low APT group.

However, RT is associated with significant life long morbidity. We assessed the e fficacy of a two-drug induction regimen, followed by transoral robotic assisted surgery (TORS) & neck dissection for locally advanced OPSCC. Method(s): This is an IRB approved single-arm phase II study for untreated stage III or IVA OPSCC patients (pts) with an ECOG < 2 and GFR > 50 cc. Induction chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and taxotere 75 mg/m2 every 21 days for 3 cycles. Tumor shrinkage was examined after each cycle. If the primary tumor was > 80% smaller, pts underwent TORS and neck dissection(s). At post-op visits, flexible laryngoscopy, blood work, and imaging with PET/CT and/or MRI were done. Short and long term toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated. Result(s): Nineteenpts were treated and 14 are available for analysis. Thirteen were male, 12 were Caucasian, 2 were African-American, and 13 were HPV+. Median age at diagnosis was 57. Tumors involved the tonsil (11 pts) and base of tongue (3 pts). Three pts were stage III, and 11 were stage IVA. Tumor size was reduced on average by 58%, 84% and 92% after the 1st, 2 and 3 induction cycles respectively. Pathologic complete remission of primary disease occurred in 11 pts and in 7 pts with cervical lymph node disease. Four pts were given dose-reduced chemo and one pt was changed to carboplatin per protocol because of renal dysfunction. In addition, adverse events included three patients with grade I fatigue, neuropathy or nausea. Pre vs post tx QOL scores were not significantly different. At a mean follow-up (f/u) of 13 months (range 2.5 to 19.7), 13 pts are alive and well. Three pts recurred, and were treated with salvage CRT. One pt died of metastatic disease. Conclusion(s): Cisplatin + Taxotere is an effective induction tx for OPSCC, Induction tx followed by transoral & neck resections without RT is a promising tx model for OPSCC. It appears effective while avoiding adverse effects of RT. Longer f/u is required to assess its true e fficacy.",Excluded

A secondary aim was to compare the correlation between symptom severity and CBF.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Differences in regional cerebral perfusion between patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and healthy controls were investigated with pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling perfusion MR imaging. Twenty-one consecutive patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and 21 age- and sex-matched randomly selected healthy controls from the population registry were prospectively included. The controls did not differ from patients with respect to selected vascular risk factors. Twelve different anatomic ROIs were manually drawn on coregistered FLAIR images. The Holm-Bonferroni correction was applied to statistical analyses.RESULTS: In patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, perfusion was reduced in the periventricular white matter (P < .001), lentiform nucleus (P < .001), and thalamus (P < .001) compared with controls. Cognitive function in patients correlated with CBF in the periventricular white matter (r = 0.60, P < .01), cerebellum (r = 0.63, P < .01), and pons (r = 0.71, P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: Using pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling, we could confirm findings of a reduced perfusion in the periventricular white matter, basal ganglia, and thalamus in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus previously observed with other imaging techniques.",Excluded
3943,"Combined effects of various forms of motor deprivation and gamma irradiation on the higher nervous activity in rats. [Russian] Effects of gamma-radiation at a dose of 3 Gy against either antiorthostatic hypodynamia (AOH) or hypokinesia (HK) on formation of the differentiated motor-drinking reflex (DR) were compared. Each of the forms of motor deprivation hindered the elaboration of DR; gamma-irradiation aggravated these disorders. At the same time, AOH led to significantly more severe disturbances in the higher nervous activity including the generalized excitation, pathologic aggressiveness and neurotization of animals. In contrast, hypokinesia stimulated the active elements of behavior which inhibit the passive-defensive behavior and a fear reaction. Therefore, the modifying effect of irradiation becomes apparent only if combined with AOH.",Included
4658,"A link between vascular damage and cognitive deficits after whole-brain radiation therapy for cancer: A clue to other types of dementia? Whole brain radiation therapy for the treatment of tumors can sometimes cause cognitive impairment. Memory deficits were noted in up to 50% of treated patients over a short period of several months. In addition, an increased rate of dementia in young patients has been noted over the longer term, i.e. years. A deficit in neurogenesis after irradiation has been postulated to be the main cause of cognitive decline in patients, but recent data on irradiation therapy for limited parts of the brain appear to indicate other possibilities. Irradiation can directly damage various types of cells other than neuronal stem cells. However, this paper will focus on injury to brain vasculature leading to cognitive decline since vessels represent a better therapeutic target for drug development than other cells in the brain because of the blood-brain barrier.",Excluded

Mean age of the persons was 41. Vegetative dystonia syndrome was diagnosticated in 50% of examined subjects. The increased perception and pain thresholds, as well as the thresholds' asymmetry were determined in 30% of patients. The conduction velocity of sensory and motor nerves, as well as the neuromuscular transmission were normal. No substantial changes in parameters of the soleus H- and M-responses were detected. A decreased amplitude and increased latency of the evoked skin sympathetic potential were found indicating a decreased tone of the adrenergic sympathetic vasoconstrictors and cholinergic sudomotor fibres, that may be one of the pathogenic mechanisms of the sensory, vegetotrophovascular disorders for these subjects. Decreased activity of the sympathetic autonomic system causes permanent course of the vegetative dystonia syndrome and more seldom the parasympathetic autonomic paroxysms. A decreased tone of the sympathetic autonomic system may be due to the monoaminergic neuromediation inhibition (decreased noradrenaline and dopamine excretion for the same subjects), that can induce psychoemotional disorders, depression and sleep-wakeness cycle disorders.",Included

To verify a discrepancy between the data obtained using different pharmacological models, neurochemically neutral electroshocks were applied here. To produce brain dysplasia of different degrees, pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to a single 1.0. Gy dose of gamma rays on gestation days 13, 15, 17 or 19. From the postnatal day 60, their male offspring (E13s, E15s, E17s and E19s, respectively) were subjected to 21 daily electrical stimulations to evoke seizures. Profiles of tonic and clonic reactivity to electrical stimulation significantly differed from those observed following pilocarpine or kainic acid administration. E17s showed minimal intensity of tonic but maximal of clonic responses. On the contrary, very high tonic and low clonic reactivity was observed in E13s and E15s. Periventricular nodular heterotopias (PNHs) were observed exclusively in E15s and E17s. Generally, the size of PNHs was correlated positively with susceptibility to tonic seizures but negatively with susceptibility to clonic seizures. Analogous correlations with the size of the neocortex were opposite. E13s and E19s had brains devoid PNHs but showed high tonic seizure susceptibility similar to that in E15s. It can therefore be concluded that PNHs modified the type of seizure reactivity from tonic to clonic, depending of their size, but the presence of PNHs was not necessary for the development of seizure susceptibility itself.

4816,"Contribution to the pathogenesis of radiation-induced injury to large arteries We report a case of a 35-year-old man who died of a brain infarct 20 months after radiotherapy for carcinoma of the tonsil with metastases to the cervical lymph nodes. Histology revealed mild atherosclerosis, necrotizing vasculitis, and occlusive thrombosis of the internal carotid artery. Significant changes were observed in the vasa vasorum: swelling and detachment of the endothelium, subendothelial oedema, hyaline change, fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls with mononuclear cellular infiltration, accompanied by focal haemorrhages and chronic inflammation in the periadventitial soft tissue. We believe that these changes of the vasa vasorum and necrotizing vasculitis are causally related and that vasculitis represents focal ischaemic necroses with inflammatory reaction. Our findings support the hypothesis, based on experimental studies, that injury to the vasa vasorum is an important mechanism in the development of radiation-induced vasculopathy of large arteries. They also suggest an evolution of the injury to the vasa vasorum and periadventitial tissue from the early lesions described in our patient, to late stages resulting in dense periadventitial fibrosis as reported previously. We suggest that injury to the vasa vasorum and the consequent ischaemic lesions of the arterial wall are morphological features distinguishing radiation-induced arterial injury from spontaneous atherosclerosis.",Excluded
4695,"Hemorrhage risk of cerebral arteriovenous malformations before and during the latency period after GAMMA knife radiosurgery BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the hemorrhage rates of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and the risk factors of hemorrhage before and after Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS).METHODS: The annual hemorrhage rate was calculated as the number of hemorrhages divided by the patient-years at risk. Characteristics of patients and AVM related to hemorrhagic or nonhemorrhagic presentation were evaluated by logistic regression. Risk factors predicting AVM hemorrhage during the period from the diagnosis to GKS of AVM and during the latency period after radiosurgery were evaluated using Cox regression hazards model.RESULTS: The annual hemorrhage rate before GKS was 2.0% assuming patients were at risk for hemorrhage since their birth. The hemorrhage rate calculated between the diagnosis and GKS of AVM was 6.6% and reduced to 2.5% after GKS until obliteration of the AVM. Although small and deep nidi and those with deep and single draining veins tended to present themselves with hemorrhage, only nidi with single draining veins and those ruptured before were more likely to bleed once the AVM had been diagnosed. These factors no longer predisposed the nidus to a rupture after radiosurgery and the only predicting factor for hemorrhage was a low radiosurgical prescription dose to the margin of nidus.CONCLUSIONS: The AVM hemorrhage rate seems to reduce after GKS. After radiosurgery, none of the patients or nidus-related risk factors remained relevant to the occurrence of hemorrhage. The nidus treated with a high radiosurgical dose is less likely to bleed.",Excluded
4230,"Reactive gliosis in the adult zebrafish retina In contrast to mammals, zebrafish posses the remarkable ability to regenerate retinal neurons. Damage to the zebrafish retina induces Muller glia to act as stem cells, generating retinal progenitors for regeneration. In contrast, injury in the mammalian retina results in Muller glial reactive gliosis, a characteristic gliotic response that is normally detrimental to vision. Understanding the signaling pathways that determine how Muller glia respond to injury is a critical step toward promoting regeneration in the mammalian retina. Here we report that zebrafish Muller glia exhibit signs of reactive gliosis even under normal regenerative conditions and that cell cycle inhibition increases this response. Persistently reactive Muller glia increase their neuroprotective functions, temporarily saving photoreceptors from a cytotoxic light lesion. However, the absence of a sustained proliferation response results in a significant inhibition of retinal regeneration. Interestingly, when cell cycle inhibition is released, a partial recovery of regeneration is observed. Together, these data demonstrate that zebrafish Muller glia possess both gliotic and regenerative potential.",Excluded
4364,"A colourful clock Circadian rhythms are an essential property of life on Earth. In mammals, these rhythms are coordinated by a small set of neurons, located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). The environmental light/dark cycle synchronizes (entrains) the SCN via a distinct pathway, originating in a subset of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) that utilize the photopigment melanopsin (OPN4). The pRGCs are also innervated by rods and cones and, so, are both endogenously and exogenously light sensitive. Accumulating evidence has shown that the circadian system is sensitive to ultraviolet (UV), blue, and green wavelengths of light. However, it was unclear whether colour perception itself can help entrain the SCN. By utilizing both behavioural and electrophysiological recording techniques, Walmsley and colleagues show that multiple photic channels interact and enhance the capacity of the SCN to synchronize to the environmental cycle. Thus, entrainment of the circadian system combines both environmental irradiance and colour information to ensure that internal and external time are appropriately aligned.",Excluded

Optimum treatment with prophylactic brain irradiation has been shown not to cause adverse effects with detailed psychometric testing. Several additional sources of information can be drawn together to suggest a dose-response pattern for prophylactic brain irradiation, leading to the recommendation that a dose of 25-36 Gy is optimal, delivered in 2-3 Gy daily fractions after the completion of chest irradiation and chemotherapy.

(177)Lu-DOTATATE and (68)Ga-DOTATOC/(68)Ga-DOTATATE are used, respectively, for PRRT and PET examinations targeting somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) in patients affected by neuroendocrine tumors. The aim of the study was to quantitatively and qualitatively compare the performance of (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE in the context of subsequent PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE under standardized conditions in the same patient as well as to investigate the sufficiency of standardized uptake value (SUV) for estimation of SSTR expression.METHODS: Ten patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors underwent one 45-min dynamic and 3 whole-body PET/CT examinations at 1, 2, and 3 h after injection with both tracers. The number of detected lesions, SUVs in lesions and normal tissue, total functional tumor volume, and SSTR volume (functional tumor volume multiplied by mean SUV) were investigated for each time point. Net uptake rate (Ki) was calculated according to the Patlak method for 3 tumors per patient.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in lesion count, lesion SUV, Ki, functional tumor volume, or SSTR volume between (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE at any time point. The detection rate was similar, although with differences for single lesions in occasional patients. For healthy organs, marginally higher uptake of (68)Ga-DOTATATE was observed in kidneys, bone marrow, and liver at 1 h. (68)Ga-DOTATOC uptake was higher in mediastinal blood pool at the 1-h time point (P = 0.018). The tumor-to-liver ratio was marginally higher for (68)Ga-DOTATOC at the 3-h time point (P = 0.037). Blood clearance was fast and similar for both tracers. SUV did not correlate with Ki linearly and achieved saturation for a Ki of greater than 0.2 mL/cm(3)/min, corresponding to an SUV of more than 25.CONCLUSION: (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE are suited equally well for staging and patient selection for PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE. However, the slight difference in the healthy organ distribution and excretion may render (68)Ga-DOTATATE preferable. SUV did not correlate linearly with Ki and thus may not reflect the SSTR density accurately at its higher values, whereas Ki might be the outcome measure of choice for quantification of SSTR density and assessment of treatment outcome.",Excluded

Planarians are flatworms and regenerate from tiny body fragments, a process requiring a population of proliferating cells (neoblasts). Whether regeneration is accomplished by pluripotent cells or by the collective activity of multiple lineage-restricted cell types is unknown. We used ionizing radiation and single-cell transplantation to identify neoblasts that can form large descendant-cell colonies in vivo. These clonogenic neoblasts (cNeoblasts) produce cells that differentiate into neuronal, intestinal, and other known postmitotic cell types and are distributed throughout the body. Single transplanted cNeoblasts restored regeneration in lethally irradiated hosts.

3941,"Radiosurgical Lesionectomy For Cavernomas Associated With Drug Resistant Epilepsy Purpose/Objective(s): Cavernous malformations (CMs) are congenital vascular malformations of the brain which cause hemorrhage and repetitive neurological deficits but the most frequent presenting symptom is epilepsy and is due to deposition of iron and blood products at the margin of the lesion. Microsurgical excision is preferred for cortical-subcortical epileptogenic CMs that are not located in functional cortex. For patients presenting with seizures arising from eloquent cortex surrounding the lesion, radiosurgery appears to be a suitable alternative. We evaluated the effectiveness of SRS in seizure cessation for drug-resistant seizures associated with CMs. Materials/Methods: This retrospective single center study where in 11 patients with cortical or subcortical CMs located in highly functional areas with severe long-term drug-resistant epilepsy underwent radiosurgery. The mean duration of epilepsy before these SRS procedures was 6yrs (+/-2.4) years. The mean frequency of seizures was 5 /month (+/-12). The mean marginal radiation dose was 18.5 Gy. Result(s): At median follow-up of 38mo, 54% were seizure free (Engel's class I), including 5 in class IA and 1 of the patients with occasional auras. A highly significant decrease in the number of seizures was achieved for 27% pts (class IIB). The remaining 19% patients showed little or no improvement. Outcomes were better for patients with simple partial seizures than for those with complex partial seizures. Location in the mesio-temporal region was associated with a poor outcome (2 of 11 patients), whereas location in the latero-temporal region was associated with a good outcome (5 of 11 patients). Location in the central region was also associated with an excellent outcome. Radiologically, 6 patients presented major reactional edema during the first year after SRS. In 2 of these patients, neuroradiological alterations were associated with clinical manifestations which included severe hemiparesis and speech impairment, but both patients fully recovered during the follow-up period with steroids. Post reactional edema correlates well with the response to the therapy. Conclusion(s): While radiosurgery role in controlling the bleeding in CM is controversial, it is a promising modality for epilepsy associated with CMs. The determination of the extent of the epileptogenic zone in CMs and dose selection are the critical steps towards successful radiosurgical outcome. Further prospective work is necessary. Copyright Â© 2020",Excluded

Targeting the CD95 apoptotic pathway is a promising experimental approach to these neoplasms. Here, we asked whether irradiation modulates CD95-mediated apoptosis of human malignant glioma cells in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODS: LN-18, LN-229 and T98G human malignant glioma cell lines were irradiated with dosages from 0-8 Gy and treated with CD95L (CD95 ligand). CD95 expression was assessed by flow cytometry. Caspase activity was determined by DEVD cleavage. Cytotoxic effects were assessed by crystal violet staining of cells in a 96-well plate assay. Clonogenic cell death was determined by a standard colony forming assay.RESULTS: We find that (i) CD95L-induced apoptosis, but not irradiation-induced clonogenic cell death, involves caspase 3 activation and is blocked by the viral caspase inhibitor, crm-A. (ii) Irradiation does not modulate CD95 expression either in p53 wild-type or in p53 mutant glioma cell lines, and does not enhance CD95L-evoked caspase 3 activity or CD95L-induced clonogenic cell death.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that endogenous CD95/CD95L interactions are not involved in radiation-induced clonogenic cell death and that the killing cascades of CD95L and irradiation are independent in human malignant glioma cells.",Excluded
4613,"Acoustic neuromas: Evaluation of outcomes and toxicity with the use of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy Purpose/Objective: A number of different therapeutic strategies are commonly used to treat acoustic neuromas including gamma knife radiosurgery, linear accelerator based radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. Our centre treats patients with a fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy regime of 52.5 Gray in 25 fractions. Outcomes and toxicities of patients treated with this regime from 1995 to 2010 are presented here. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective review of all the available electronic case notes, as well as imaging reports for patients treated for acoustic neuroma, were conducted. RECIST criteria were used to assess response on imaging and treatment outcomes, and were analysed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Toxicity assessments were also conducted. Radiotherapy methods include immobilisation in a non-invasive relocatable Gill-Thomas-Cosman head frame with stereotactic head ring. A depth helmet was also used to ensure and verify reproducibility and a maximum tolerance of 2 mm was permitted. For tumour localisation and organs at risk (OAR) delineation a planning CT scan of the head was performed with the stereotactic head ring in place using 2 mm slices. CT images were transferred to the X knife radiotherapy planning computer system via the DICOM network for automatic external contouring, clinician contouring of target volume and OAR, followed by dose planning. After 2001 diagnostic 2mm stealth MRI scans were co-registered with the planning CT scan to allow more accurate delineation of target volume and OAR. Most patients were treated with an average of 3 non-coplanar arcs, with each arc having an equal collimator size which tended to be about 3 cm. This therefore produced a spherical shaped dose distribution. The choice of collimator size and arrangement of arcs depended on the size of tumour and location in relationship to the OAR, in particular the brainstem. A single iso-centre was chosen and the radiation dose was usually prescribed to 100% at the iso-centre using 6 MV photons. Result(s): 93 patients were identified of which 83 patients were available for follow-up with a median period of 5.7 years. Overall control rate using RECIST criteria was 92% (Fig 1). Toxicity data were available for 90 patients with 6 (7%) experiencing a reduction in hearing, 1 (1%) had a deterioration in their trigeminal nerve function and 1 (1%) had a deterioration in facial nerve function (Table 1). 4 (4%) patients developed hydrocephalus, requiring the placement of a shunt and 1 (1%) patient developed radiation brainstem necrosis. After further evaluation this patient was deemed to have been treated within acceptable dose constraints.

Epidemiological data support an increased risk for breast and other cancers in A-T heterozygotes. However, screening breast cancer cases for truncating mutations in the ATM (A-T mutated) gene has failed largely to reveal an increased incidence in these patients. It has been hypothesized that ATM missense mutations are implicated in breast cancer, and there is some evidence to support this. The presence of a large variety of rare missense variants in addition to common polymorphisms in ATM makes it difficult to establish such a relationship by association studies. To investigate the functional significance of these changes we have introduced missense substitutions, identified in either A-T or breast cancer patients, into ATM cDNA before establishing stable cell lines to determine their effect on ATM function. Pathogenic missense mutations and neutral missense variants were distinguished initially by their capacity to correct the radiosensitive phenotype in A-T cells. Furthermore missense mutations abolished the radiation-induced kinase activity of ATM in normal control cells, caused chromosome instability, and reduced cell viability in irradiated control cells, whereas neutral variants failed to do so. Mutant ATM was expressed at the same level as endogenous protein, and interference with normal ATM function seemed to be by multimerization. This approach represents a means of identifying genuine ATM mutations and addressing the significance of missense changes in the ATM gene in a variety of cancers including breast cancer.",Excluded

We describe a laboratory protocol for transcranial photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) in mice. Aged BALB/c mice (18 months old) are treated with a 660 nm laser transcranially, once daily for 2 weeks. Laser transmittance data shows that approximately 1% of the incident red light on the scalp reaches a 1 mm depth from the cortical surface, penetrating the dorsal hippocampus. Treatment outcomes are assessed by two methods: a Barnes maze test, which is a hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory task evaluation, and measuring hippocampal ATP levels, which is used as a bioenergetics index. The results from the Barnes task show an enhancement of the spatial memory in laser-treated aged mice when compared with age-matched controls. Biochemical analysis after laser treatment indicates increased hippocampal ATP levels. We postulate that the enhancement of memory performance is potentially due to an improvement in hippocampal energy metabolism induced by the red laser treatment. The observations in mice could be extended to other animal models since this protocol could potentially be adapted to other species frequently used in translational neuroscience, such as rabbit, cat, dog, or monkey.

However, the number of training samples with complete modalities is often limited. In practice, many samples generally have incomplete modalities (i.e., with one or two missing modalities) that thus cannot be used in the prediction process. In light of this, we develop a semisupervised tripled dictionary learning (SSTDL) method for S-PET image prediction, which can utilize not only the samples with complete modalities (called complete samples) but also the samples with incomplete modalities (called incomplete samples), to take advantage of the large number of available training samples and thus further improve the prediction performance.RESULTS: Validation was done on a real human brain dataset consisting of 18 subjects, and the results show that our method is superior to the SR and other baseline methods.CONCLUSION: This paper proposed a new S-PET prediction method, which can significantly improve the PET image quality with low-dose injection.SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed method is favorable in clinical application since it can decrease the potential radiation risk for patients.",Excluded

We used meDIP-seq to examine radiation-induced changes in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) throughout the genome. To examine tissue specificity, we compared the methylomes of heart and brain tissue 22 weeks after exposure to protons. We found 5mC and 5hmC changes that mapped to genes with cardiovascular functions in the heart and with neuronal functions in the brain. We also compared two forms of ionizing radiation, the sparsely ionizing protons and densely ionizing 56Fe ions. Both are components of galactic cosmic radiation, which is a concern for astronauts flying deep space missions. Specifically, we asked whether protons and 56Fe ions would produce similar DNA methylation changes in the brain at 4 weeks post exposure, and found significant overlap for both 5mC and 5hmC changes. Interestingly, gene expression changes in the brain at 4 weeks were linked to changes in 5hmC at promoter regions, but not 5mC, and these linked changes mapped to neuronal ontology pathways. Further, a novel form of 5hmC change along gene bodies was observed and mapped mostly to postsynaptic pathways. Finally, the extent of 56Fe ion-induced behavioral change correlated inversely with DNA methylation change suggesting that the epigenomic response to radiation was part of the repair process to mitigate its toxic effects.",Included

Contrast extravasation was correlated with clinical coma level (P < 0.05), and all contrast extravasation was found within 6 hours from onset. Early mortality, treatment decision, and hematoma distribution type did not correlate with existence of contrast extravasation. We also observed 4 cases of secondary subpial hematoma due to SAH, with 3 showing extravasation in both phases. Conclusion(s): Dual-phase CTA with a short interval enhances detection frequency of contrast extravasation in SAH and might be a better evaluation tool for SAH.

4636,"Distinct inhibition of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels by delta-opioid agonists in dorsal root ganglion neurons devoid of functional T-type Ca2+ currents Both mu- and delta-opioid agonists selectively inhibit nociception but have little effect on other sensory modalities. Voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels in the primary sensory neurons are important for the regulation of nociceptive transmission. In this study, we determined the effect of delta-opioid agonists on voltage-activated Ca(2+) channel currents (I(Ca)) in small-diameter rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons that do and do not bind isolectin B(4) (IB(4)). The delta-opioid agonists [d-Pen(2),d-Pen(5)]-enkephalin (DPDPE) and deltorphin II produced a greater inhibition of high voltage-activated I(Ca) in IB(4)-negative than IB(4)-positive neurons. Furthermore, DPDPE produced a greater inhibition of N-, P/Q-, and L-type I(Ca) in IB(4)-negative than IB(4)-positive neurons. However, DPDPE had no significant effect on the R-type I(Ca) in either type of cells. We were surprised to find that DPDPE failed to inhibit either the T-type or high voltage-activated I(Ca) in all the DRG neurons with T-type I(Ca). Double immunofluorescence labeling showed that the majority of the delta-opioid receptor-immunoreactive DRG neurons had IB(4) labeling, while all DRG neurons immunoreactive to delta-opioid receptors exhibited Cav(3.2) immunoreactivity. Additionally, DPDPE significantly inhibited high voltage-activated I(Ca) in Tyrode's or N-methyl-d-glucamine solution but not in tetraethylammonium solution. This study provides new information that delta-opioid agonists have a distinct effect on voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels in different phenotypes of primary sensory neurons. High voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels are more sensitive to inhibition by delta-opioid agonists in IB(4)-negative than IB(4)-positive neurons, and this opioid effect is restricted to DRG neurons devoid of functional T-type Ca(2+) currents.",Excluded

4836,"Cortical activation with deep brain stimulation of the anterior thalamus for epilepsy OBJECTIVE: We studied the relation between thalamic stimulation parameters and the morphology, topographic distribution and cortical sources of the cerebral responses in patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus.METHODS: Bipolar and monopolar stimuli were delivered at a rate of 2 Hz to the anterior (AN, four patients), the dorsomedian (DM, four patients), and the centromedian nucleus (CM, one patient) using the programmable stimulation device (Medtronic ITREL II). Source modeling was carried out by using statistical non-parametric mapping of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) values.RESULTS: All patients demonstrated reproducible time-locked cortical responses (CRs) consisting of a sequence of components with latencies between 20 and 320 ms. The morphology of these CRs, however, was very heterogeneous, depending primarily on the site of stimulation. Following AN stimulation, cortical activation was most prominent in ipsilateral cingulate gyrus, insular cortex and lateral neocortical temporal structures. Stimulation of the DM mainly showed activation of the ipsilateral orbitofrontal and mesial and lateral frontal areas, but also involvement of mesial temporal structures. Stimulation of the CM showed a rather diffuse (though still mainly ipsilateral) increase of cortical activity. The magnitude of cortical activation was positively related to the strength of the stimulus and inversely related to the impedance of the electrode.CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of cortical activation corresponded with the hodology of the involved structures and may underscore the importance of optimal localization of DBS electrodes in patients with epilepsy.SIGNIFICANCE: The method of analyzing sources of CRs could potentially be a useful tool for titration of DBS parameters in patients with electrode contacts in clinically silent areas. Furthermore, the inverse relation of the cortical activation and the impedance of the electrode contacts might suggest that these impedance measurements should be taken into consideration when adjusting DBS parameters in patients with epilepsy.",Excluded
4736,"Fractionated stereotactic conformal radiotherapy in the management of large chemodectomas of the skull base Purpose To evaluate the role of fractionated stereotactic conformal radiotherapy (FSRT) as a noninvasive method in the management of large chemodectomas of the skull base. Methods and materials Twenty-two patients with chemodectomas of the skull base were treated with FSRT at our institution. Ten patients received primary RT, and 12 patients were treated for recurrent or progressive disease after primary surgery (8 patients) or embolization (4 patients). The median total dose was 57.6 Gy, with a median of 1.8 Gy/fraction. The median target volume was 71.8 cm<sup>3</sup> (range, 10.5-212.2 cm <sup>3</sup>). The most common symptoms at the initial diagnosis were pulsatile tinnitus (16 patients), hearing loss (14 patients), and balance disturbance (14 patients). Twelve patients had additional cranial nerve deficits. Results The median follow-up was 5.7 years (range, 19-177 months). The actuarial overall survival rate was 89.5% at 5 and 10 years. The actuarial local control rate was 90.4% at 5 and 10 years. Seven patients (32%) had a partial response and 13 (59%) had stable disease of the irradiated chemodectoma. Two symptomatic patients developed recurrence after 19 and 32 months. Neurologic dysfunction improved or completely resolved in 59% and stabilized in 32%; 9% of patients experienced impairment of preexisting neurologic dysfunction. No patient developed new neurologic deficits after FSRT. RT was interrupted in 1 patient because of a maxillary bone abscess. In all other patients, no acute or late adverse reactions greater than Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 2 were seen. Conclusion Fractionated stereotactic conformal radiotherapy is an effective and well-tolerated noninvasive treatment for chemodectomas, with excellent tumor control rates and a low risk of morbidity. It is an option for patients at greater risk of microsurgical resection or with residual and recurrent tumors. Â© 2004 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4264,"Olfactory testing in staff working in the cardiac catheterization laboratory Background: In the absence of specific protection, invasive cardiologists receive a high lifetime head exposure, with organ doses in the 1 to 3 Sievert range (equivalent to the risk of 50,000 to 150,000 chest x-rays). Radiation exposure in this dose range can reduce neurogenesis in adult brain and negatively impact on olfactory function, whose impairment is a recognized early biomarker of neurode-generative disease. Aim(s): To assess psychological testing results in exposed subjects (ES) working as staff in the Cath Lab compared with non-exposed matched controls (NES). Method(s): A complete olfactory test battery (Sniffin' Sticks Extended test) was performed in 130 Cath Lab ES (60 males; age=44.9+/-8.7 years; 58 interventional cardiologists, 60 nurses, 12 technicians). A control group of age- and gendermatched non-exposed subjects (NES) was also studied. Result(s): ES showed lower scores in the Odor Threshold test (p=.006), Discrimination test (p=.039), Identification test (p=.005) and TDI (the sum of the previous 3 tests, p<.001), as reported in Figure. Subnormal scores of at least 1 of 3 odor subtests were present in 18/130 ES and 7/130 NES (13.8 vs 5.4%, p<.001). Significant correlations were found between Identification Score and years at Cath Lab (r=-.18, p=.012), this last parameter being also correlated with the overall TDI Score (r=-.16, p=.048). (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): In ES, olfactory testing showed mild impairment of identification (cortical), discrimination (bulb) and threshold (peripheral) function, somewhat correlated with radiation exposure in the Cath Lab. While further evidence is needed at this point, in the meantime head protection should be a mandatory good practice of safety in every Cath Lab.",Included
4403,"Feasibility of intracoronary beta-irradiation to reduce restenosis after balloon angioplasty. A clinical pilot study BACKGROUND: With the aim of decreasing the incidence of restenosis after coronary balloon angioplasty, we developed a technique of intracoronary beta-irradiation using an endoluminally centered pure metallic 90Y source. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical feasibility and safety profile of this approach with a dose of 18 Gy delivered to the inner arterial surface.METHODS AND RESULTS: Between June 21 and November 15, 1995, fifteen patients (6 women and 9 men; mean age, 71 +/- 5 years) underwent intracoronary beta-irradiation immediately after a conventional percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedure. The PTCA/irradiation procedure was technically feasible in all attempted cases, and the delivery of the 18 Gy dose was accomplished without complications. In 4 patients, the intervention was completed through intra-arterial stent implantation because of dissection induced by the initial PTCA. During the follow-up period of 178 +/- 17 days (range, 150 to 225 days), no complication occurred that could be attributed to radiation therapy. No aneurysm or angiographically detectable thrombus was observed in any of the irradiated arterial segments. The clinical event rate (4 of 15 patients underwent further target lesion revascularization) and the angiographic follow-up (6 of 15 patients had a > 50%-diameter stenosis at the previously treated site) did not suggest a marked impact on the expected restenosis rate.CONCLUSIONS: This early experience demonstrates that our approach is feasible, and no side effects attributable to radiation were noted during a 6-month period of follow-up. Whether higher doses of beta-irradiation will favorably affect post-PTCA restenosis in patients must await further evaluation.",Excluded

3999,"Photopigment self-screening and the determination of macular pigment absorbance using heterochromatic flicker photometry PURPOSE: Heterochromatic flicker photometry (HFP) is commonly used to determine macular pigment optical density (MPOD). Since HFP in this application is a locus comparison method, an identical relative spectral response at each locus is required for a perfect measure. We know this requirement cannot be strictly true since the optical density of photopigments increases as the foveal center is approached. Thus, the self-screening effect would result in an underestimate of MPOD. An earlier study concluded that the underestimate is on the order of 30%. We examined this issue by manipulating photopigment optical density, and consequently the degree of selfscreening.METHODS: A continuously exposed, 470 nm, background bleached cone photopigments over a range from 0 to 80%. MPOD was determined 10' and 30' from the foveal center. Two subjects were used in the main experiment. Five additional subjects were studied with just the 0% and 80% bleach levels. Spectral measures were obtained at 0% and 70% bleach levels for the two primary subjects.RESULTS: Subjects in the main experiment showed MPOD estimates that increased with increasing bleaching. The effect, however, was small: one observer's MPOD increased 0.08 and 0.02 for the 10' and 30' loci, respectively; the other observer's values were 0.04 and 0.01 for the same loci. Comparable values were obtained for the other five subjects using the 0% and 80% bleach conditions. Spectral measures were consistent with the findings of the main experiment.CONCLUSIONS: When self-screening is nearly abolished (80% bleach), a relatively small underestimation is revealed for the unbleached state. For the 1degree target we show about 2-3% underestimation. Our 20' target reveals a larger underestimate (8-9%), consistent with longer photoreceptor outer-segments nearer the foveal center. We conclude that HFP yields values essentially independent of self-screening for targets of 1degree diameter or greater. Smaller targets are less than 10% underestimated for near-zero bleach conditions.",Excluded

4701,"Melatonin treatment for prevention of oxidative stress: involving histopathological changes This study was undertaken to test the effect of irradiation on the histopathology of the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex. In addition, the probable effects of radiotherapy on the activities of antioxidant enzymes and levels of nitric oxide (NO) in the plasma were investigated as well. The effects of melatonin treatment on radiotherapy-based central nervous system (CNS) damage were also studied. For this purpose, the rats were randomized into four groups. The first group was the control group (sham-exposed group), the second group received only melatonin, the third group was irradiated and the fourth group received both melatonin and irradiation. Plasma samples of rats were collected for measuring the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and the levels of NO. 24 h after the interventions, tissue samples were obtained from the hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex for the light microscopic investigations. These tissues were mostly affected by radiation. The results indicated that the application of radiation significantly enhanced the levels of plasma SOD and NO. On the other hand, melatonin pretreatment prevented the decrease in plasma CAT activity induced by irradiation. It was found that the application of melatonin could significantly prevent the irradiation-induced damages. Light microscopic results revealed that the damage of the CNS by radiation was prevented by the application of melatonin.",Included
4474,"[Exposure to ionizing radiation: radiobiological effects and pathogenesis. 1] The present paper describes the radiobiological effects induced by an exposure to ionizing radiation and their pathogenesis. The different skin reactions are described in detail because of their importance and frequency. Thus the acute skin lesions after high doses and the late effects resulting, either from high doses, or from accumulation of chronic irradiation, are studied. The main early syndromes are then characterized: neurological, gastro-intestinal, bone-marrow and prodromic. As far as the complex problem of radiocarcinogenesis is concerned, the main results derived from studies by international organizations such as the ICRP and the UNSCEAR are reported: risk coefficient of 5% per gray, for lethal radio-induced cancer, after total body irradiation, at low dose of low-LET radiation. The effects of irradiation in utero are then considered: risk of malformation after irradiation during the two first months of pregnancy and risk of mental retardation after irradiation during the third and the fourth months. Finally, the genetic risk is presented as being equal to one fourth of the risk of carcinogenesis at low-doses. The effects of irradiation on the gonads are also described.

3679,"Seizure suppression by EEG-guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the rat OBJECTIVE: To test the anticonvulsive potential of a range of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequencies by novel methods for simultaneous EEG and rTMS in a rat seizure model.METHODS: Seizures were triggered by intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA; 10mg/kg). Rats (n=21) were divided into three groups in which individual seizures were treated with rTMS trains at one of three frequencies: 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 Hz. EEG was continuously viewed by an operator who identified each seizure onset. Consecutive seizures in each animal were (1) treated with active rTMS, (2) treated with sham rTMS, or (3) were untreated. EEG was re-analyzed post hoc by visual inspection, and seizure durations were compared within and between treatment groups.RESULTS: KA-induced seizures were abbreviated by 0.75 Hz (P=0.019) and 0.5 Hz (P=0.033) active EEG-guided rTMS. In contrast, neither active 0.25 Hz rTMS nor the control conditions affected seizure duration (P>0.2).CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that EEG-guided rTMS can suppress seizures in the rat KA epilepsy model, and that the effect is frequency dependent, with 0.75 and 0.5 Hz rTMS being superior to 0.25 Hz rTMS.SIGNIFICANCE: These data support the use of rat seizure models in translational research aimed at evaluation and development of effective rTMS anticonvulsive protocols. We also offer a proof of principle that real-time analysis of EEG can be used to guide rTMS to suppress individual seizures.",Excluded
3960,"The ketone body s-hydroxybutyrate radiosensitizes glioblastoma multiforme stem cells Glioblastomamultiforme (GBM) is amalignant brain tumor that typically recurs following standard treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. A rare population of radio-chemoresistant glioma stem cells (GSCs) is implicated in tumor repopulation and progression following treatment. Improvement in the prognosis of these patients requires the development of new therapeutic approaches. One emerging strategy is to target aberrant cell metabolism, a trait shared by virtually all tumor cells. The ketogenic diet (KD), a high fat, low carbohydrate and protein metabolic therapy has demonstrated anti-tumor effects alone, and in combination with radiation. The KD prolongs survival in animal glioma models, and when used in conjunction with radiation 9 of 11micewere cured of their implanted tumors. We are now extending this work to determine if the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) radiosensitizes human GSCs in vitro. The effects of betaHB on growth were examined at various betaHB concentrations in two GSC lines, L0andL1. Both 5mM and 10 mM betaHB significantly reduced GSC growth. When coupled with 4Gy of radiation, 5mM betaHB treatment significantly reduced L1 neurosphere formation and frequency, more than either betaHB treatment or radiation alone. In L0, combination treatment significantly reduced neurosphere formation and frequency, more than radiation alone. To explore underlying mechanisms we are investigating the effect of betaHB on DNA damage and repair in GSCs. Additionally, we are determining the effect of betaHB on hypoxia within GSC neurospheres by analyzing expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha and the hypoxic marker carbonic anhydrase 9. We previously showed that the KD reduced the expression of these genes in a mouse glioma model. Taken altogether, these data suggest that betaHB may sensitize GBMs to radiation by inhibiting growth of both glioma cells and GSCs, which may have implications for its use to treat tumor recurrence.",Excluded
4813,"Environmental damage to the retina and preconditioning: contrasting effects of light and hyperoxic stress PURPOSE: Environmental stress (bright light, hypoxia) can ""condition"" retinal photoreceptors, increasing their resistance to subsequent stress. The present study tests whether another photoreceptor-lethal stress, hyperoxia, can induce similar resistance.METHODS: Vulnerability to hyperoxia was tested in young adult C57BL/6J mice exposed to 1000 lux cyclic light for 1 week or to 50% O2 for 1 week and then to 75% O2 for 2 weeks. Vulnerability to light was tested in Balb/cJ mice exposed to 300 lux cyclic light for 2 days or to 75% O2 for 2 weeks and then to 1000 lux cyclic light for 1 week. Retinas were analyzed for photoreceptor death, levels of stress-related proteins (GFAP, FGF-2, MnSOD, acrolein), and the regulation of candidate neuroprotective genes (HSP70.1, Ledgf, FGF-13, Timp2).RESULTS: Light preconditioning did not cause measurable death of photoreceptors but reduced photoreceptor death induced by subsequent hyperoxic or light stress, reduced levels of stress-related proteins, and maintained the length and organization of photoreceptor outer segments. Hyperoxic preconditioning caused measurable cell death but provided no protection against subsequent hyperoxic or light stress. Of the four candidate neuroprotective proteins examined, the regulation of only one (Timp2) seemed associated with the neuroprotection observed.CONCLUSIONS: Light preconditioning, causing only minimal damage to photoreceptors, induced protection against subsequent stress from both hyperoxia and light. By contrast, hyperoxic preconditioning caused measurable photoreceptor damage but induced no protection against light or hyperoxia. These data suggest a separation between stress-induced damage to photoreceptors and the upregulation of protective mechanisms, encouraging the search for ways to protect the retina without damaging it.",Excluded

4668,"The prospective self-controlled study of two different percutaneous pedicle screw insertion positions for treatment of thoracolumbar fracture in seven-year minimum follow-up Purpose: To test the hypothesis that different percutaneous pedicle screw insertion position would increase the likelihood of facet joint injury and degeneration. Method(s): This prospective study included 35 patients with one-level neurological intact thoracolumbar fracture. From January 2006 to December 2007, patients were randomized underwent posterior reduction and percutaneous pedicle fixation using two different insertion techniques. The patients were followed up postoperatively and were assessed with regard to radiological and clinical outcomes. Radiologic outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of vertebral body height, kyphotic angle and facet joint degeneration. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly with use of visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Result(s): The operation was completed successfully in 35 patients. All patients were follow-up for an average of 89 months. There were no significant differences in percutaneous pedicle fixation time and radiation dose between two insertion techniques. In the transverse processpedicle group (TG), the length of the pedicle screw were significantly longer than control group (CG). Preoperative kyphotic angle and vertebral body height were significantly improved after surgery, and these has been well maintained at the last follow-up. There was significant differences in the occurrence of facet joint degeneration more than 1 grade between two groups (TG:3 vs. CG:23). All patients had significantly improvement on VAS and ODI scores after surgery, compared with their preoperative period. In the control group, 19 patients had obvious pain in the puncture sites at 1 month postoperatively caused by facet joint violation. With local block treatment, the pain disappeared in all patients at the last follow-up. Conclusion(s): The degeneration of facet joint is closely related to the position of the pedicle screw and rod during minimally invasive surgery. Compared with traditional puncture technique, the transverse process-pedicle puncture technique can reduce the facet joint degeneration caused by pedicle screw violation and rod stress, and provide enough space for transpedicular interbody bone grafting.",Excluded

4740,"Magnetic resonance imaging-guided attenuation and scatter corrections in three-dimensional brain positron emission tomography Reliable attenuation correction represents an essential component of the long chain of modules required for the reconstruction of artifact-free, quantitative brain positron emission tomography (PET) images. In this work we demonstrate the proof of principle of segmented magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided attenuation and scatter corrections in three-dimensional (3D) brain PET. We have developed a method for attenuation correction based on registered T1-weighted MRI, eliminating the need of an additional transmission (TX) scan. The MR images were realigned to preliminary reconstructions of PET data using an automatic algorithm and then segmented by means of a fuzzy clustering technique which identifies tissues of significantly different density and composition. The voxels belonging to different regions were classified into air, skull, brain tissue and nasal sinuses. These voxels were then assigned theoretical tissue-dependent attenuation coefficients as reported in the ICRU 44 report followed by Gaussian smoothing and addition of a good statistics bed image. The MRI-derived attenuation map was then forward projected to generate attenuation correction factors (ACFs) to be used for correcting the emission (EM) data. The method was evaluated and validated on 10 patient data where TX and MRI brain images were available. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of differences between TX-guided and segmented MRI-guided 3D reconstructions were performed by visual assessment and by estimating parameters of clinical interest. The results indicated a small but noticeable improvement in image quality as a consequence of the reduction of noise propagation from TX into EM data. Considering the difficulties associated with preinjection TX-based attenuation correction and the limitations of current calculated attenuation correction, MRI-based attenuation correction in 3D brain PET would likely be the method of choice for the foreseeable future as a second best approach in a busy nuclear medicine center and could be applied to other functional brain imaging modalities such as SPECT.",Excluded

In this study, we analysed the treatment parameters and outcomes of our cranial meningioma patients treated with SRT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013, 103 cranial meningioma lesions of 93 patients were treated with CyberKnife (Accurayw) Stereotactic Radiosurgery Unit. 42 patients (45%) received SRT as primary modality, and 51 patients ( 55 %) received postoperatively. Six patients have treated with external beam radiotherapy. Of the 103 cases, 69 of the lesions were located basally, 34 of them nonbasally. The most common symptoms in patients with basal tumours (38 patients, 58%) was detoriation in the visual field and the restriction of the eye movements and in patients with non-basal tumours (8 patients, 26%) was headache. In 33 patients (32%) tumours were located just adjacent to the optic apparatus or brain stem, 27 of them (26%) were located close (<1cm) to the optic apparatus or brain stem. SRT dose and fractionation were determined according to tumor localization. Optical apparatus and brainstem maximum point dose constraints for one fraction were 10 Gy and 14 Gy; 25 Gy and 30 Gy were for 5 fractions. RESULT(S): The median age was 44 (16-81). The female to male ratio was 73/20 (3.6/1). Median follow-up was 10 months (1-37 months). The median dose was 2500cGy (1500 - 3000 cGy). The median number of fraction was5 (1-5 fractions) fraction.GTVvolume ranged between 0.66cm3and 80.6 cm3 (Median 12.4 cm3). Median conformity index was 1.4 (1.06 to 2.03) and the median homogeneity index was 1.25 (1.09 to 1.56). Among the patients with follow up, local control rate was 98%. Only one patient with parasagittal meningioma underwent decompressive surgery due to radiation induced edema. All other side effects were either grade I or II. The most common side effect was headache associated with brain edema in 10 patients (11%).

Maximum recurrences were noticed within 2 cm of the original tumor margin in both the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Although local control and survival of the patient in both the groups were same, performance status definitely improved in patients treated with localized field irradiation only.",Excluded
4759,"Metastatic location of extensive stage small-cell lung cancer: implications for thoracic radiation BACKGROUNDS: This study was designed to evaluate the role of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) in a selected patient population with oligometastatic extensive stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) without brain or liver involved. The underlying hypothesis was that TRT will improve outcomes in this favorable patient population.METHODS: 305 patients were included in an institutional review board (IRB)-approved study, of which 105 received TRT after chemotherapy (ChT) and 200 received ChT alone. The survival outcomes were compared between ChT+TRT group and ChT-alone group in patients with oligometastasis without brain or liver involved and patients with brain/liver/multimetastasis, respectively.RESULTS: The 1-year, 2-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) for all patients were 60.3%, 23.9% and 1.6%, respectively. The addition of TRT significantly improved PFS in total patients than ChT alone (14.5 months vs. 10.1 months, p = 0.006), but the OS benefit was not significant (17.8 months vs. 16.5 months, p = 0.061). For patients with oligometastasis (n = 118), TRT offered significant progression free survival (PFS) (16.5 months vs. 9.1 months, p = 0.005) and OS (19.2 months vs. 15.6 months, p = 0.039) benefits. However, for patients with brain/liver/multimetastasis, the PFS and OS were not improved with TRT (p = 0.49, p = 0.811).CONCLUSIONS: TRT provided significant PFS and OS benefits in patients with oligometastatic ES-SCLC without brain or liver involved. The consolidative TRT is a reasonable treatment option for this favorable patient population.",Excluded

Patients were examined with (11)C-L-methionine PET and MRI prior to treatment and after 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years. Temporal changes in methionine uptake ratio, meningioma volume, meningioma regrowth and clinical symptoms throughout the follow-up period were evaluated.RESULTS: In 17 patients the tumour volume was unchanged throughout the follow-up. The methionine uptake ratio on PET decreased over the years in most patients. In two patients the tumour remnant showed progression on MRI. In these patients, prior to the volume increase on MRI, the methionine uptake ratio increased. One patient experienced transient clinical symptoms and showed radiological evidence of a radiation-induced reaction close to the irradiated field.CONCLUSION: Proton beam treatment is a safe and effective treatment for achieving long-term growth arrest in meningioma remnants. Follow-up with (11)C-L-methionine PET may be a valuable adjunct to, but not a replacement for, standard radiological follow-up.",Excluded
4572,"A comparison of two systems of patient immobilization for prostate radiotherapy BACKGROUND: Reproducibility of different immobilization systems, which may affect set-up errors, remains uncertain. Immobilization systems and their corresponding set-up errors influence the clinical target volume to planning target volume (CTV-PTV) margins and thus may result in undesirable treatment outcomes. This study compared the reproducibility of patient positioning with Hipfix system and whole body alpha cradle with respect to localized prostate cancer and investigated the existing CTV-PTV margins in the clinical oncology departments of two hospitals.METHODS: Forty sets of data of patients with localized T1-T3 prostate cancer were randomly selected from two regional hospitals, with 20 patients immobilized by a whole-body alpha cradle system and 20 by a thermoplastic Hipfix system. Seven sets of the anterior-posterior (AP), cranial-caudal (CC) and medial-lateral (ML) deviations were collected from each patient. The reproducibility of patient positioning within the two hospitals was compared using a total vector error (TVE) parameter. In addition, CTV-PTV margins were computed using van Herk's formula. The resulting values were compared to the current CTV-PTV margins in both hospitals.RESULTS: The TVE values were 5.1 and 2.8 mm for the Hipfix and the whole-body alpha cradle systems respectively. TVE associated with the whole-body alpha cradle system was found to be significantly less than the Hipfix system (p < 0.05). The CC axis in the Hipfix system attained the highest frequency of large (23.6%) and serious (7.9%) set-up errors. The calculated CTV to PTV margin was 8.3, 1.9 and 2.3 mm for the Hipfix system, and 2.1, 3.4 and 1.8 mm for the whole body alpha cradle in CC, ML and AP axes respectively. All but one (CC axis using Hipfix) margin calculated did not exceed the corresponding hospital protocol. The whole body alpha cradle system was found to be significantly better than the Hipfix system in terms of reproducibility (p < 0.05), especially in the CC axis.CONCLUSIONS: The whole body alpha cradle system was more reproducible than the Hipfix system. In particular, the difference in CC axis contributed most to the results and the current CC margin for the Hipfix system might be considered as inadequate.",Excluded
4750,"Effects of irradiation on brain vasculature using an in situ tumor model PURPOSE: Damage to normal tissue is a limiting factor in clinical radiotherapy (RT). We tested the hypothesis that the presence of tumor alters the response of normal tissues to irradiation using a rat in situ brain tumor model.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Intravital microscopy was used with a rat cranial window to assess the in situ effect of rat C6 glioma on peritumoral tissue with and without RT. The RT regimen included 40 Gy at 8 Gy/day starting Day 5 after tumor implant. Endpoints included blood-brain barrier permeability, clearance index, leukocyte-endothelial interactions and staining for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) glial fibrillary acidic protein, and apoptosis. To characterize the system response to RT, animal survival and tumor surface area and volume were measured. Sham experiments were performed on similar animals implanted with basement membrane matrix absent of tumor cells.RESULTS: The presence of tumor alone increases permeability but has little effect on leukocyte-endothelial interactions and astrogliosis. Radiation alone increases tissue permeability, leukocyte-endothelial interactions, and astrogliosis. The highest levels of permeability and cell adhesion were seen in the model that combined tumor and irradiation; however, the presence of tumor appeared to reduce the volume of rolling leukocytes. Unirradiated tumor and peritumoral tissue had poor clearance. Irradiated tumor and peritumoral tissue had a similar clearance index to irradiated and unirradiated sham-implanted animals. Radiation reduces the presence of VEGF in peritumoral normal tissues but did not affect the amount of apoptosis in the normal tissue. Apoptosis was identified in the tumor tissue with and without radiation.CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel approach to demonstrate that the presence of the tumor in a rat intracranial model alters the response of normal tissues to irradiation.",Excluded
3992,"Prophylactic hyperbaric oxygen treatment and rat spinal cord re-irradiation Normal tissue injury may lead to severe, life threatening, late side effects after therapeutic use of irradiation. Neurological complications caused by radiation of the spinal cord are ascribed to progressive, irreversible damage to the vasculature. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is known to induce angiogenesis in irradiated tissue and has been proven to reduce late radiation injury in several normal tissues when applied during the latent period before complications become manifest. In the present study: (1) the prophylactic potential of HBO; (2) optimal timing of HBO therapy after spinal cord irradiation, i.e. during the latent period; and (3) effect of HBO on the re-irradiation tolerance of the spinal cord were investigated. The rat cervical spinal cord was locally X-ray irradiated with ten fractions of 6.5 Gy in 11 days. Five treatment groups (n=10) included: irradiation alone and irradiation followed by 30 HBO treatments (100% oxygen at 240 kPa for 90 min) during latency, with HBO starting either immediately, 5, 10 or 15 weeks after the primary irradiation course. One year after the primary treatment, the same spinal cord volume was re-irradiated with 20 Gy single dose. During life span, the animals were observed on the incidence of myelitis and the duration of the latent period. The actuarial analysis revealed no significant difference in neurological complications free survival between the irradiation alone and the irradiation+HBO treatment groups. A tendency towards radiosensitization was found in the group in which the primary irradiation course was immediately followed by the HBO treatment course. The data show that HBO applied during the latent period of progressively developing irradiation damage to the spinal cord does not increase the re-irradiation tolerance of this tissue.

Female rats were exposed to RF fields for a period of 2 years for 2 h per day, 5 days per week at average whole-body specific absorption rates of 0.3 or 0.9 W/kg. MX was given in the drinking water at a concentration of 19 mug/ml. Blood samples were taken at 3, 6 and 24 months of exposure and brain and liver samples were taken at the end of the study (24 months). DNA damage was assessed in all samples using the alkaline comet assay, and micronuclei were determined in erythrocytes. We did not find significant genotoxic activity of MX in blood and liver cells. However, MX induced DNA damage in rat brain. Co-exposures to MX and RF radiation did not significantly increase the response of blood, liver and brain cells compared to MX exposure only. In conclusion, this 2-year animal study involving long-term exposures to RF radiation and MX did not provide any evidence for enhanced genotoxicity in rats exposed to RF radiation.

4122,"Clinical and molecular recursive partitioning analysis of high-grade glioma treated with IMRT INTRODUCTION: Despite multimodal treatment for high-grade gliomas, prognosis remains grim. Since the development of the RTOG-RPA, high-grade gliomas have seen the widespread introduction of temozolomide and tumor onco-genetics. We aimed to determine whether the RTOGRPA retained prognostic significance in the context of modern treatment paradigm, as well as generate an updated RPA incorporating both clinical and genetic variables. METHOD(S): Patients with histologically-proven high-grade gliomas treated with IMRT between 2004-2017 were reviewed. The primary endpoint was overall survival from date of diagnosis. Primary analysis compared actual survival rates to that expected of corresponding RTOG-RPA class. Secondary analysis utilized the rpart function to recursively partition overall survival by numerous clinical and genetic pre-treatment and treatment-related variables. A tertiary analysis recursively partitioned a subset of patients in which the status of all genetic markers were known. RESULT(S): We identified 878 patients with a median overall survival of 14.2 months (95% CI: 13.1-15.3). Our cohort validated the relative prognostic ordering of the RTOG RPA survival classes except class II. Our new RPA created 7 significantly different survival classes (p2 = 584) with median survival ranging from 96.4 to 2.9 months based on age, histology, MGMT methylation, radiation fractions, tumor location, radiation dose, temozolomide, and resection. Our second RPA of our genetic subset (291 patients) generated 5 significantly different survival classes (p2 = 166) with survival ranging from 65.3 to 5.6 months based on age, IDH1 mutation, MGMT methylation, neurologic functional classification, IMRT hospitalization, temozolomide, and KPS. CONCLUSION(S): This series represents a large RPA analyzing clinical and genetic factors and generated 7 distinct survival classes. Further assessment of patients with fully available genetic markers generated 5 distinct survival classes. These classifications need to be validated by a prospective dataset and compared against the RTOG-RPA to determine if they provide improved prognostic power.",Excluded
4667,"Preventive and curative effects of radon inhalation on chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain in mice BACKGROUND: Radon therapy is clinically useful for the treatment of pain-related diseases. However, there have been no studies regarding the effects of radon inhalation on neuropathic pain. In this study, we aimed to determine whether radon inhalation actually induced a remission of neuropathic pain and improved the quality of life.METHODS: First, we investigated the antinociceptive effects of radon inhalation in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain. We evaluated pain behaviour in mice before and after CCI surgery, using von Frey test. Pretreated mice received CCI surgery immediately after 24-h inhalation of radon at background (BG) concentration (c. 19 Bq/m(3) ), or at a concentration of 1000 or 2000 Bq/m(3) , and post-treated mice inhaled similar levels of radon 2 days after CCI surgery.RESULTS: CCI surgery induced mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia on a plantar surface of mice, as assessed using von Frey test, and 2000 Bq/m(3) radon inhalation alleviated hyperalgesic conditions 22-37% compared to BG level concentration. Concurrently, CCI surgery increased norepinephrine (NE), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations in plasma, and leukocyte migration in paws. Furthermore, CCI-induced neuropathy reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Treatment with radon inhalation, specifically at a concentration of 2000 Bq/m(3) , produced antinociceptive effects, i.e., lowered plasma TNF-alpha, NE and NO levels and restored SOD activity, as well as pain-related behaviour.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that inhalation of 2000 Bq/m(3) radon prevented and alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain in mice.",Excluded
4193,"In vivo evaluation of 18F-MNI698: an 18F-labeled radiotracer for imaging of serotonin 4 receptors in brain UNLABELLED: Serotonin 4 receptors (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 [5HT4R]) hold promise as a novel therapeutic approach to multiple brain disorders, including Alzheimer and Huntington disease. In vivo imaging of these receptors with selective 5HT4R radiotracers and PET would be valuable to investigate alterations in 5HT4R in different brain disorders and to assist drug discovery. In this study, (18)F-MNI698 was evaluated as a potential PET radiotracer for imaging of 5HT4R in the brain.METHODS: Eighteen PET studies were performed in 3 adult rhesus monkeys. The radiotracer was administered as a bolus intravenous injection or bolus plus constant infusion (time that would be required to inject the bolus at the infusion rate = 60 min), and arterial blood was collected for data quantification. Kinetic models were used to estimate distribution volumes and binding potentials, for which the cerebellum was used as a reference region. (18)F-MNI698 test-retest variability and upper mass dose limits were determined. Preblocking studies using several doses of SB204070, a selective 5HT4R antagonist, were performed.RESULTS: (18)F-MNI698 avidly entered the monkey brain (peak percentage injected dose of ~ 6.6%), and its brain distribution was consistent with known 5HT4R densities. At 120 min after bolus injection and after the start of radiotracer infusion, only less than 5% and approximately 10% parent compound was present in blood, respectively. Measured binding potentials were underestimated by 22%-36% when noninvasive methods were used for data quantification in comparison with invasive methods. A good agreement was found between test-retest measurements. The radiotracer upper mass dose limit (<5% occupancy) was determined to be 13.1 mug per 70 kg of body weight. SB204070 blocked the radiotracer binding in a dose-dependent manner.CONCLUSION: Data indicate that (18)F-MNI698 is a promising PET radiotracer for imaging of 5HT4R in the brain, and human studies are warranted based on these study results.",Excluded
4046,"Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibition delays recurrence of glioblastoma after radiation by altering myeloid cell recruitment and polarization BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) may initially respond to treatment with ionizing radiation (IR), but the prognosis remains extremely poor because the tumors invariably recur. Using animal models, we previously showed that inhibiting stromal cell-derived factor 1 signaling can prevent or delay GBM recurrence by blocking IR-induced recruitment of myeloid cells, specifically monocytes that give rise to tumor-associated macrophages. The present study was aimed at determining if inhibiting colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) signaling could be used as an alternative strategy to target pro-tumorigenic myeloid cells recruited to irradiated GBM.METHODS: To inhibit CSF-1 signaling in myeloid cells, we used PLX3397, a small molecule that potently inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R). Combined IR and PLX3397 therapy was compared with IR alone using 2 different human GBM intracranial xenograft models.RESULTS: GBM xenografts treated with IR upregulated CSF-1R ligand expression and increased the number of CD11b+ myeloid-derived cells in the tumors. Treatment with PLX3397 both depleted CD11b+ cells and potentiated the response of the intracranial tumors to IR. Median survival was significantly longer for mice receiving combined therapy versus IR alone. Analysis of myeloid cell differentiation markers indicated that CSF-1R inhibition prevented IR-recruited monocyte cells from differentiating into immunosuppressive, pro-angiogenic tumor-associated macrophages.CONCLUSION: CSF-1R inhibition may be a promising strategy to improve GBM response to radiotherapy.",Excluded
4719,"Plan quality comparison between 4-arc and 6-arc noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of multiple brain metastases To compare the plans of 4-arc and 6-arc noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc stereotactic radiotherapy (VMA-SRT) for multiple brain metastases and to investigate the cutoff value for the tumor number and volume for 6-arc rather than 4-arc VMA-SRT. We identified 24 consecutive multiple-target cases (3 to 19 targets in each case) with 189 total targets. We constructed plans using both 4- and 6-arc noncoplanar VMA-SRT. The prescribed dose was 36 Gy/6 fr, and it was delivered to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV). The plans were evaluated for the dose conformity using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and Paddick conformity indices (RCI and PCI), fall-off (Paddick gradient index [PGI]), and the normal brain dose. The median (range) RCI, PCI, and PGI was 0.94 (0.92 to 0.99), 0.89 (0.77 to 0.94), and 3.75 (2.24 to 6.54) for the 4-arc plan and 0.94 (0.91 to 0.98), 0.89 (0.76 to 0.94), and 3.65 (2.24 to 6.5) for the 6-arc plan, respectively. The median (range) of the normal brain dose was 910.3 cGy (381.4 to 1268.9) for the 4-arc plan and 898.8 cGy (377 to 1252.9) for the 6-arc plan. The PGI of the 6-arc plan was significantly superior to that of the 4-arc plan (p = 0.0076), and the optimal cutoff values for the tumor number and volume indicative of 6-arc (and not 4-arc) VMA-SRT were cases with >= 5 metastases and a PTV of >= 12.9 mL, respectively. The PCI values, however, showed no significant difference between the 2 plans. We believe these results will help in considering the use of 6-arc VMA-SRT for multiple brain metastases.

This study was performed to explore its role in visual processing.METHODS: PKCalpha-knockout (Prkca(-/-)) mice and control animals were examined by using electroretinography (ERG), light microscopy, and immunocytochemistry.RESULTS: The Prkca(-/-) mice showed no signs of retinal degeneration up to 12 months of age, but ERG measurements indicated a decelerated increase in the ascending limb of the scotopic (rod-sensitive) b-wave as well as a delayed return to baseline. These results suggest that PKCalpha is an important modulator that affects bipolar cell signal transduction and termination. Confocal microscopy of retinal sections showed that PKCalpha co-localized with calbindin, which indicates a PKCalpha localization in close proximity to the horizontal cell terminals. In addition, the implicit time of the ERG c-wave originating from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the recovery of photoreceptors from bleaching conditions were substantially faster in the knockout mice than in the wild-type control animals.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PKCalpha is a modulator of rod-bipolar cell function by accelerating glutamate-driven signal transduction and termination. This modulation is of importance in the switch between scotopic and photopic vision. Furthermore, PKCalpha seems to play a role in RPE function.",Excluded
4265,"Corilagin Attenuates Radiation-Induced Brain Injury in Mice Cranial irradiation-induced inflammation plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI). Anti-inflammation treatment may provide therapeutic benefits. Corilagin (beta-1-O-galloyl-3, 6-(R)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-D-glucose, C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>18</sub>) was a novel member of the tannin family with anti-inflammatory properties and is isolated from some medicinal plants, such as Phyllanthus amarus and Caesalpinia coriaria. In this study, the effect of Corilagin on RIBI was investigated and the underlying mechanisms were explored. Spatial learning and memory ability of mice were investigated by the Morris water maze test. Evans blue leakage and electron microscopy were used to assess the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB). The mRNA and protein expressions of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, were measured by using real-time PCR and Western blotting. The activation of microglial cells and expression of TNF-alpha were examined by immunofluorescence staining. Phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) and IkappaBalpha, and the translocation of p65 from cytoplasm to nucleus were detected by using Western blotting. Morris water maze test showed that Corilagin ameliorated the neurocognitive deficits in RIBI mice. Evans blue leakage and electron microscopy exhibited that Corilagin partially protected the BBB integrity from cranial irradiation-caused damage; immunofluorescence staining showed that Corilagin could inhibit microglial activation and TNF-alpha expression. Real-time PCR and Western blotting revealed that Corilagin downregulated the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and inhibited the irradiation-induced activation of NF-kappaB pathways by upregulating p-STAT3 expression. In conclusion, Corilagin could attenuate RIBI through inhibiting microglial activation and the expressions of inflammatory cytokines. Corilagin might inhibit the activation of NF-kappaB pathway in a STAT3-associated manner, thereby downregulating the inflammatory cytokine expressions.",Included

Noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy plans consisted of 4 noncoplanar arcs and 2 full coplanar arcs, respectively. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy plans consisted of 7 coplanar fields. CyberKnife plans used skull tracking to ensure accurate position. All plans were generated to cover 95% target volume with prescription dose. Gradient index, conformity index, normal brain tissue volume (V <sub>3Gy</sub> - V <sub>24Gy</sub>), monitor units, and beam on time were evaluated.RESULTS: Gradient index was the lowest for CyberKnife (3.49 +/- 0.65), followed by noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (4.21 +/- 1.38), coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (4.87 +/- 1.35), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (5.36 +/- 1.98). Conformity index was the largest for noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (0.87 +/- 0.03), followed by coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (0.86 +/- 0.04), CyberKnife (0.86 +/- 0.07), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (0.85 +/- 0.05). Normal brain tissue volume at high-to-moderate dose spreads (V <sub>24Gy</sub> - V <sub>9Gy</sub>) was significantly reduced in noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy over that of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy. Normal brain tissue volume for noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy was comparable with noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy at high-dose level (V <sub>24Gy</sub> - V <sub>15Gy</sub>) and larger than CyberKnife at moderate-to-low dose level (V <sub>12Gy</sub> - V <sub>3Gy</sub>). Monitor units was highest for CyberKnife (28 733.59 +/- 7197.85), followed by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (4128.40 +/- 1185.38), noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (3105.20 +/- 371.23), and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (2997.27 +/- 446.84). Beam on time was longest for CyberKnife (30.25 +/- 7.32 minutes), followed by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (2.95 +/- 0.85 minutes), noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (2.61 +/- 0.07 minutes), and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (2.30 +/- 0.23 minutes).CONCLUSION: For brain metastases far away from organs-at-risk, noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy generated more rapid dose falloff and higher conformity compared to intensity-modulated radiation therapy and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy. Noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy provided a comparable dose falloff with CyberKnife at high-dose level and a slower dose falloff than CyberKnife at moderate-to-low dose level.

3788,"Reverberation challenges the temporal representation of the pitch of complex sounds Accurate neural coding of the pitch of complex sounds is an essential part of auditory scene analysis; differences in pitch help segregate concurrent sounds, while similarities in pitch can help group sounds from a common source. In quiet, nonreverberant backgrounds, pitch can be derived from timing information in broadband high-frequency auditory channels and/or from frequency and timing information carried in narrowband low-frequency auditory channels. Recording from single neurons in the cochlear nucleus of anesthetized guinea pigs, we show that the neural representation of pitch based on timing information is severely degraded in the presence of reverberation. This degradation increases with both increasing reverberation strength and channel bandwidth. In a parallel human psychophysical pitch-discrimination task, reverberation impaired the ability to distinguish a high-pass harmonic sound from noise. Together, these findings explain the origin of perceptual difficulties experienced by both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners in reverberant spaces.",Excluded
4539,"Event-triggered neuroadaptive control for postcapture spacecraft with ultralow-frequency actuator updates This paper investigates an event-triggered neuroadaptive control approach for postcapture flexible spacecraft with guaranteed prespecified tracking performance in the presence of unknown inertial properties, actuator constraints, and external space perturbations. By employing the minimum-learning parameter technique into the neural proportional integral-like controller, only two adaptive parameters are required to update online, which completely avoids the tedious inertial parameter identifications and dramatically reduces the complexity of controller in the meanwhile. Compared with existing works, the primary advantage of the proposed attitude control approach is that the actuator updates are determined by the prescribed event-based conditions in an aperiodic way rather than a periodic one, which greatly reduces the actuator updates. Finally, two groups of illustrative examples are organized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of attitude stabilization and tracking for the postcapture flexible spacecraft.

Similarly, a few case studies have reported the effectiveness of SBRT for stage I small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, no study has investigated the use of SBRT for extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Compared with conventional RT, SBRT is able to deliver a higher radiation dose precisely and safely to small targets in short-duration treatments. The present study reports the outcome of a patient with ES-SCLC who responded favorably to initial chemotherapy and received SBRT for a residual mass in the peripheral lung. A 62-year-old female presented with pathologically determined SCLC at clinical stage T4N3M0-T4 as separate tumor nodules were present in different ipsilateral lobes. The patient received 6 cycles of standard chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide. The response of the patient to chemotherapy was evaluated using contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography and <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography. The only suspected residual viable tumor was a 1.5-cm mass in the right upper lobe. Targeting this mass, intensity-modulated SBRT was performed with 48 Gy in 4 fractions and 6 MV photons. In addition, prophylactic cranial irradiation was conducted with 25 Gy in 10 fractions. The patient is alive with no evidence of disease 4 years after treatment. SBRT toxicity was limited to radiation pneumonitis or fibrosis without pulmonary symptoms.

Rats that had received embryonic day (E) 19-20 fetal retinal sheet transplants at the age of 26-30 days were tested at the ages of 200-254 days. Controls were age-matched rats without surgery and with sham surgery. As a baseline, in no-surgery line-5 rats, the temporal pattern of visual sensitivity loss was evaluated electrophysiologically in the SC from 60 days up to one year of age.RESULTS: In untreated S334ter-line-5 rats, decline in visual sensitivity in the SC was parallel to the photoreceptor loss. At 109 day of age, a relative scotoma developed in the area of the SC corresponding to the nasal retinal region. At 200-254 days of age, the majority of the SC was devoid of any light-driven responses. In contrast, at this time point, transplanted rats with 'good' retinal grafts with normal lamination had visual responses in the caudal region of the SC, the area corresponding topographically to the transplant location in the retina. In these rats, the various parameters of SC responses such as the latency of the onset of the visual response, the response peak amplitude and the consistency of the visual response were significantly different from the control groups (no-surgery, sham surgery, 'poor' transplants) and were more comparable to normal albino rats, however, with a slightly longer latency (70-90 vs. 30-50 msec).CONCLUSIONS: Fetal retinal sheet transplantation showed a long-term rescue effect on visual function in this animal model of slow photoreceptor degeneration.",Excluded
4325,"Comparison of the targeting characteristics of various radioimmunoconjugates for radioimmunotherapy of neuroblastoma: dosimetry calculations incorporating cross-organ beta doses To optimize the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy (RIT), the ideal antibody-radioisotope combinations should be used to deliver the highest tumor and the lowest normal tissue doses. In a mouse model, tumor and critical organ-absorbed doses delivered by different radioimmunoconjugates were calculated and compared. We used a Medical Internal Radiation Dosimetry (MIRD)-style mouse dosimetry model that incorporates cross-organ beta doses to make refined estimates of the radiation absorbed dose to tissues. Biodistribution data from neuroblastoma xenografted nude mice were used to estimate tumor, organ and bone marrow absorbed dose values for 90Y-3F8, 131I-3F8 and 131I-F(ab')2 fragments. Immunoreactive fractions of the radiolabeled antibodies were comparable. Although tumor uptake of the radioiodinated and radiometal labeled 3F8 was much higher than that of the radioiodinated F(ab')2 fragments (maximum percent injected dose per gram values were 39.4, 33.2 and 20.1 for 131I-3F8, 90Y-3F8 and 131I-F(ab')2, respectively), tumor to nontumor ratios were higher for radioiodinated fragments (with the exception of tumor to kidney ratio). For the minimum tumor dose necessary for complete ablation, the bone marrow received 195, 278 and 401 cGy for 131I-F(ab')2, 131I-3F8 and 90Y-3F8, respectively. Tumor doses were 50.1, 232 and 992 cGy/MBq for 131I-F(ab')2, 131I-3F8 and 90Y-3F8, respectively. Tumor to bone marrow dose, which is defined as the therapeutic index, was 21.5, 14.7 and 10.4 for 131I-F(ab')2, 131I-3F8 and 90Y-3F8. 131I-F(ab')2 fragments produced the highest therapeutic index but also the lowest tumor dose for radioimmunotherapy.

Between March 2008 and August 2009, 10 patients were treated with SRT boost using CyberKnife system due mainly to unfavorable condition such as tumors in close proximity to serial organs or former radiotherapy fields. Treatment sites were the external auditory canal in two, the nasopharynx in one, the oropharynx in three, the nasal cavity in one, the maxillary sinus in two, and the oligometastatic cervical lymph node in one. All patients underwent preceding conventional radiotherapy of 40 to 60 Gy. Dose and fractionation scheme of the Cyberknife SRT boost was individualized, and prescribed dose ranged from 9 Gy to 16 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions. Among four patients for whom dose to the optic pathway was concerned, the maximum dose was only about 3 Gy for three patients whereas 9.6 Gy in the remaining one patient. The maximum dose for the mandible in one of three patients with oropharyngeal cancer was 19.7 Gy, whereas majority of the bone can be spared by using non-isocentric conformal beams. For a patient with nasopharyngeal cancer, the highest dose in the brain stem was 15 Gy. However, majority of the brain stem received less than 40% of the maximum dose.

This is a retrospective, observational, single-center trial analyzing 77 consecutive patients with recurrent BM who were treated primarily with WBRT. All patients underwent SRS as salvage treatment. Median age was 62 years, and median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) was 80. The median interval between the starting date of WBRT and radiosurgery was 10.6 months. One, two and more than two SRS sessions were required in 42, 13 and 22 patients, respectively. The median total planning target volume (PTV) was 8.1 mL and the median dose prescribed was 20 Gy. The median follow-up was 7.7 months. 1- and 2-year neurological death-free survival (NS) rates were 87 and 78 %, respectively. Competing risk analysis demonstrated active extra-central nervous system (CNS) disease [Hazard ratio (HR) 0.236, P = 0.041] and total PTV on initial SRS (>= 5 mL) (HR 4.22, P = 0.033) to be associated with the NS rate. 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates were 41 and 11 %, respectively. The median OS time was 8.2 months. Active extra-CNS disease (HR 1.94, P = 0.034) and high KPS (>= 90) (HR 0.409, P = 0.006) were associated with the OS rate. In total, 798 tumors (75 %) in 66 patients (86 %) with sufficient radiological follow-up data were evaluated. 1- and 2-year metastasis local control rates were 76.6 and 57.9 %, respectively. Prescribed dose (>= 20 Gy) (HR 0.326, P < 0.001), tumor volume (>= 2 mL) (HR 1.98, P = 0.007) and metastases from breast cancer (HR 0.435, P < 0.001) were independent predictive factors for local tumor control.

4419,"Current status and future potential of advanced technologies in radiation oncology. Part 2. State of the science by anatomic site In December 2006, the Radiation Research Program of the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis of the National Cancer Institute hosted a workshop intended to address current issues related to advanced radiation therapy technologies, with an eye toward (1) defining the specific toxicities that have limited the success of ""conventional"" radiation therapy, (2) examining the evidence from phase III studies for the improvements attributed to the advanced technologies in the treatment of several cancers commonly treated with radiation therapy, and (3) determining the opportunities and priorities for further technologic development and clinical trials. The new technologies offer substantial theoretical advantage in radiation dose distributions that, if realized in clinical practice, may help many cancer patients live longer and/or better. The precision of the advanced technologies may allow us to reduce the volume of normal tissue irradiated in the vicinity of the clinical target volume. Part 1 of this two-part article, which appeared in the March issue of ONCOLOGY, provided a general overview of the workshop discussion, focusing on the challenges posed by the new technologies and resources available or in development for meeting those challenges.

3695,"Ontogeny of light-induced decrease of N-acetyltransferase activity in explanted chick pineal glands The ontogeny of chick pineal serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity was investigated in explanted chick pineal glands at 4, 10 and 21 d of age. Nocturnal levels of the enzyme and the response of the enzyme to light exposure were determined in pineal glands maintained in short-term culture at each age. The results indicate that nocturnal NAT activity was increased in the glands from older birds. Nocturnal levels of NAT activity at the time of the initiation of the experiment were threefold greater in glands from 21-d-old birds as compared to that in glands from 4-day-old chicks. The response to light was similar in all three ages examined; light induced a significant decrease in NAT activity within 60 min in explanted glands from 4-d-old chicks and within 180 min in the glands from the 10- and 21-d-old chicks. A paradoxical transient increase in enzyme activity occurred immediately (within 5 min) following light exposure which was significant in the glands from the youngest chicks, and present, but more variable, in the older chicks. These data indicate that the nocturnal enzyme activity is greater in glands from older birds, but that light exposure of explanted glands initiates a transient rise followed by a decrease in NAT activity at all three ages.",Excluded
3912,"Fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy improves symptoms from cranial neuropathies in base of skull meningiomas: The Jefferson experience Purpose/Objective(s): Skull base meningiomas commonly present with cranial neuropathies and are difficult to manage due to their location.We review the experience at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital using fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT) in the management of these patients with a focus on symptom outcomes. Materials/Methods:We identified 219 patients who were treated with FSRT for base of skull meningioma from 1/1/1994 through 3/1/2009. Seven patients received a second course of radiation therapy. We analyzed each treatment course separately, and classified treatments into four groups: RT only, adjuvant RT, RT for progression after surgery, and Re-irradiation after progression (with or without prior surgery). Symptoms were classified based on the cranial nerve affected. The gross target volume (GTV) was defined by T1-weighted MRI with contrast without inclusion of dural tails. The median prescription dose was 52.2 Gy (range 10 - 60 Gy). Patients were treated using multi-isocenter plans (median 79% isodose line) until 2004, and subsequently with single isocenter plans (median 90% isodose line). Cox proportional hazards models were used to indentify factors associated with progression, and multiple logistic regression was used to identify predictors of symptom improvement. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 3.1 years. Of 226 FSRT treatment courses, 116 were in the (51%) RT only group, 40 (18%) in the adjuvant RT group, 59 (26%) in the RT for progression after surgery group, and 11 (5%) in the re-irradiation after progression group. Patients were symptomatic at the time of radiation in 92% of cases. The most common symptoms were visual field and/or acuity deficits (55%), impaired extra-ocular movements (32%), and facial numbness (20%). Twenty-one patients progressed after FSRT. Local control rate at 5 years was 95.4% in the RTonly group, 89.8% in the adjuvant group (p=0.98), 74.3% in the progression after surgery group (p = 0.02), and 50% in the re-irradiation group (p<0.01). On multivariate analysis, prior radiation therapy (HR 3.68 p = 0.045) and midline/bilateral location (HR 2.65 p = 0.04) were significant predictors of progression; of note, treatment volume, fraction size and dose did not predict for progression. Of all patients symptomatic at presentation, 50.7% had subjective improvement in at least one symptom, and occurred at a median of 4.0 months. These improvements were durable in 82%-100% of cases, depending on cranial nerve involved. Only prior surgery (OR 0.48 95% CI 0.28 - 0.81) was associated with symptom improvement.

3996,"Primary care of the patient with cancer Care of patients with cancer can be enhanced by continued involvement of the primary care physician. The physician's role may include informing the patient of the diagnosis, helping with decisions about treatment, providing psychological support, treating intercurrent disease, continuing patient-appropriate preventive care, and recognizing and managing or comanaging complications of cancer and cancer therapies. Adverse effects of therapy and cancer-related symptoms include nausea, febrile neutropenia, pain, fatigue, depression, and emotional distress. 5-Hydroxytryptamine antagonists are effective in controlling acute nausea associated with chemotherapy. Febrile neutropenia requires systematic evaluation and early empiric antibiotics while awaiting culture results. Cancer-related pain, depression, and fatigue often are underdiagnosed and undertreated. Use of brief screening tools for assessing fatigue and emotional distress can improve management of these symptoms. Exercise prescription, activity management, and psychosocial interventions are useful in treating cancer-related fatigue. The physician must be alert for signs and symptoms of cancer-related emergencies like spinal cord compression, hypercalcemia, tumor lysis syndrome, pericardial tamponade, and superior vena cava syndrome.

For most patients, the index CT scan was the only one received over an 11-year period. However, 28.4% of patients received 1 or more CT brain scans during the preceding decade and 6.7% received 1 or more CT brain scans during the subsequent year. Of the 473 patients (75.9%) whose index scan was ordered by a primary care physician, most (80.3%) did not see a specialist during follow-up. One patient with an indeterminate finding on the index scan was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor (0.2%), and 6 patients (1.0%) died during follow-up. Among the 4 deaths in which the cause could be determined, none were due to central nervous system causes.CONCLUSION: because of the potential risk of cancer from exposure to ionizing radiation, efforts should be made to avoid CT scanning for headache when the likelihood of serious illness is low. Evidence-based decision rules that identify which patients with headache do not require neuroimaging may decrease the use of CT scans in situations of little benefit.",Excluded
4441,"Increased expression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein in limbic brain regions after amygdala-kindled seizures in rats Increased expression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp; ABCB1) has previously been found in epileptogenic brain tissue from patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) as well as in the hippocampus and other limbic brain regions in the rat kainate model of TLE. Approaches to the quantification of Pgp expression have mainly been based on subjective visual estimation of the level of Pgp immunoreactivity in brain sections. In the present study, computer-assisted image analysis based on optical density (OD) measurements was used to examine immunohistochemical expression of Pgp in the kindling model of TLE. Sections from kainate-treated rats were used for comparison. Using diaminobenzidine as chromogen, Pgp was exclusively located in brain capillary endothelial cells, which was confirmed by double-labeling with an antibody against the endothelial glucose transporter (GLUT-1). After kainate-induced seizures, the intensity of endothelial Pgp staining significantly increased by 70-80% in the dentate gyrus. A significant, albeit less marked increase in Pgp expression in this area was also seen after amygdala-kindled seizures. Furthermore, Pgp was upregulated after kindling in the hilus of the dentate gyrus, the CA1 and CA3 sectors of the hippocampus, and the piriform and cerebral cortex. In kindled rats, most Pgp alterations occurred ipsilateral to the electrode in the basolateral amygdala. The data demonstrate that computer-assisted image analysis using OD is an accurate and rapid method to determine the relative amount of Pgp protein in brain sections and the effects of seizures on this multidrug transporter. The fact that Pgp overexpression in brain capillary endothelial cells occurs in two established models of difficult-to-treat TLE substantiates the notion that seizure-induced upregulation of Pgp contributes to multidrug resistance (MDR) in epilepsy.",Excluded

This study evaluates the influence of a new OSDR algorithm on image quality of head and neck computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in clinical routine.METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients (68 +/- 13 years) were randomised into two groups and imaged using 128-row multidetector CT. Group A (n = 31) underwent conventional CTA and group B (n = 31) CTA with a novel OSDR algorithm. Subjective and objective image quality were statistically compared. Subjective image quality was rated on a five-point scale. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated with region-of-interest measurements.RESULTS: The SNR of the common carotid artery and middle cerebral artery was 53.6 +/- 22.7 and 43.3 +/- 15.3 (group A) versus 54.1 +/- 20.5 and 46.2 +/- 14.6 (group B). The CNR was 40.0 +/- 19.3 and 29.7 +/- 12.0 (group A) compared with 40.7 +/- 16.8 and 32.9 +/- 10.9 (group B), respectively. Subjective image quality was excellent in both groups (mean score 4.4 +/- 0.7 versus 4.4 +/- 0.6).

Growing evidence has suggested that systemic treatment can improve survival in addition to WBRT. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of post- WBRT anti-HER2 and other systemic treatments on survival after BM from Her-2 positive BC. Materials/Methods: A total of 54 pts with BM from HER2-positive BC treated with WBRT in single institute between January 2006 and February 2012 was retrospectively analyzed, 42 pts (77.8%) had multiple lesions. The brain was the first metastatic site for 15 pts (27.8%). Post-WBRT anti- HER2 treatment was given in 21 pts (38.9%), 9 pts received trastuzumab, 9 pts received lapatinib and the other 3 received both trastuzumab and lapatinib. Post-WBRT chemotherapy was given in 39 pts, 19 in combination with anti-HER2 treatment. Prognostic analysis was performed including age at BM, KPS/RPA, ER/PR status, number of BM, interval between BC diagnosis and BM, presence of extracranial metastases, extracranial metastases control, chemotherapy after WBRT and anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT. Radiation dose of EQD2 <=40 Gy (a/s=4.6 Gy) was given in 26 pts (74.3%). Result(s): The median interval from diagnosis of BC to the identification of BM was 29 months (range, 2-136 months). In univariate analysis, age, KPS/RPA classes, number of BM, extracranial metastases control, chemotherapy after WBRT and anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT were significant prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) (p < 0.05). While in multivariate analysis, extracranial metastases control, chemotherapy after WBRT and anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT were significant prognostic factors for OS.

4808,"Targeting the NF-E2-related factor 2 pathway: A novel strategy for glioblastoma (Review) Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant subtype among all brain tumors. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an essential component of cellular defense against a variety of endogenous and exogenous stresses. A marked increase in research over the past few decades focusing on Nrf2 and its role in regulating glioblastoma has revealed the potential value of Nrf2 in the treatment of glioblastoma. In the present review, we discuss a novel framework of Nrf2 in the regulation of glioblastoma and the mechanisms regarding the downregulation of Nrf2 in treating glioblastoma. The candidate mechanisms include direct and indirect means. Direct mechanisms target tumor molecular pathways in order to overcome resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, to inhibit proliferation, to block invasion and migration, to induce apoptosis, to promote differentiation, to enhance autophagy and to target glioblastoma stem cells. Indirect mechanisms target the reaction between glioblastoma cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Overall, the value of the Nrf2 pathway in glioblastoma provides a promising opportunity for new approaches by which to treat glioblastoma.",Excluded
4680,"CT-aided low-count whole-body PET imaging using cross-modality attention pyramid network Objectives: Reducing either the administered dose or scan time of PET imaging is desirable as it decreases the radiation exposure to the patient or can improve patient comfort as well as minimize motion artifact. However, the trade-off of these benefits are low overall counts and increased noise, adversely impacting image contrast and quantification. To enable low dose or shorten the PET scan while maintaining the high signal-to-noise ratio and sufficient image quality, we propose a novel method to integrate CT into a deep learning framework to aid the estimation of diagnostic quality PET images from low-count ultra-short PET scans. Method(s): We propose a cross-modality attention pyramid network (CMAPN) to generate diagnostic quality PET images from low-count PET images with the help of CT from PET/CT scans. Twenty subjects with whole-body PET/CT were used to estimate synthetic diagnostic PET images from a low-count training set using 1/8th of the normal scanning time (19 vs. 162 seconds/bed). CMAPN learns to translate a low-count PET image into a synthetic full-count PET image resembling the one from a high-quality diagnostic standard clinical protocol. At the training stage, independent 3D patch-based deep features were extracted from low-count PET and CT images using two separate PET synthesis sub-networks. The two sub-networks share the same pyramid network architecture. A low-count PET-only synthesis loss, and a CT-only synthesis loss were calculated between the outputs of the two sub-networks. The two losses would allow independent and relevant features to be extracted from low-count PET and CT images for the prediction of full-count PET images. The cross-modal deep features from the two subnetworks were subsequently combined to estimate a final full-count PET image. Feature maps of corresponding pyramid levels were first concatenated and then highlighted via attention gates. The network was trained by minimizing a combination of losses, including a low-count PET-only synthesis loss, a CT-only synthesis loss and a final synthesis loss. At the testing stage, paired low-count PET and CT image patches were first extracted from the original images. These image patch pairs were then inputted into the trained CMAPN to obtain the synthetic full-count PET patches. Finally, the synthetic full-count PET image patches were fused to predict the final whole-body full-count PET images. These synthetic PET images were then compared to the original diagnostic PET images for evaluation. The proposed method was tested using a leaveone-out cross-validation method. Mean error (ME), normalized mean square error (NMSE), normalized cross-correlation (NCC) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) were used to quantify the differences between the synthetic and the original diagnostic PET images. Result(s): The average ME, NMSE, NCC and PSNR in the whole body were 0.20+/-1.01% and 0.67+/-0.28%, 0.994+/-0.004% and 46.2+/-2.8dB for all patients. There were no significant differences between the synthetic and the original diagnostic PET images. In a volume of interest, such as the brain, lung, heart, kidneys, and liver, the overall ME was less than 2.5% and the NMSE was less than 1.5% for all patients. Lesion-based ME and NMSE were less than 5% for all patients. Conclusion(s): We have developed a novel CT-aided estimation method for synthetic full-count PET images using CMAPN. The proposed method could generate diagnostic quality PET datasets from ultra-short (1/8th count, 19 seconds/bed) PET scans. The organ boundary definition of the generated PET has improved due to the use of CT images in CMAPN. The proposed method has great potential to improve the quality of low-count PET scans for future implementation of low dose or fast scan PET imaging in the clinic.",Excluded

All had a history of cranial irradiation, progressive ventriculomegaly visible on neuroimaging scans, and neurologic decline; other causes of hydrocephalus were excluded. All 31 patients had cognitive deficits: 30 had gait disturbance and 24 were incontinent.RESULTS: Twenty-four (80%) of 30 assessable patients achieved symptomatic improvement an average of 1.6 months after ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Incontinence and gait problems were more likely to improve than cognition. Sixteen (53%) of 30 patients achieved a good overall functional outcome, and incontinence was the only feature significantly associated with good outcome (P=.04). Neither cerebrospinal fluid-opening pressure nor tap tests predicted improvement from ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Median duration of improvement was 6 months, and median survival after receiving the shunt was 14.5 months. Shunt-related complications occurred in 10 (33%) of 30 patients, with 1 fatal outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Our results from ventriculoperitoneal shunting in selected patients with radiation-induced hydrocephalus suggest potential benefit.

4466,"Role of short TE 1H-MR spectroscopy in monitoring of post-operation irradiated patients Post-surgical radiation therapy is a routine procedure in the treatment of primary malignant brain tumors. Along with modest therapeutic effects conventional fractionated radiotherapy, in spite of any modifications, produces damage to non-malignant brain tissues lying within the treatment volume, the extent of which depends on radiation dose. Serial 1H-MRS allows non-invasive investigation of tissue metabolic profiles. In the present study the ratios of resonance signals assigned to the major 1H-MRS-visible metabolites (N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine, inositol, lactate and lipid methylene group) were evaluated before, during and after post-surgical fractionated radiotherapy in brain regions close to and more distant from the tumor bed, receiving different radiation exposures (60 and < 40 Gy, respectively). The study group consisted of ten patients (aged 28-51). A MRI/MRS system (Elscint 2T Prestige) operating at the field strength of 2 T and the proton resonance frequency of 81.3 MHz has been used and the 1H-MR spectra were acquired using single voxel double-spin-echo PRESS sequence with a short TE. The spectra were post-processed with automatic fitting in the frequency domain. It was found that although the metabolite profiles depend on the dose obtained, but other stress factors (like surgery) seem to contribute to the overall picture of the metabolic status of the brain as well. In studies of early irradiation injuries, an increase of choline related ratios may serve rather as cell proliferation indictors than as cell injury ones, whereas the mI/Cr ratio appears as one of the first indicators of local irradiation injury. In order to establish the prognostic marker for early radiation damage, however, it seems necessary to analyze all visible metabolites as well. None of the metabolites separately may serve as such an indicator due to the complexity of tissue metabolism. Interestingly, MRI reveals no changes during the therapy process, whereas the metabolite ratios are being affected in the course of time, thus supporting the presumption that the 1H-MRS is a valuable method of radiation therapy monitoring.",Excluded
4413,"Biochemical and clinical aspects of methotrexate neurotoxicity Acute, subacute and chronic neurotoxicity have been observed after the administration of high-dose and/or intrathecal methotrexate (MTX). Acute toxicity is usually transient without permanent damage. Subacute and chronic toxicity are associated with changes in the brain and/or the spinal cord which may be progressive and even lead to coma and death in severe cases. It is believed that MTX can induce direct toxic effects to the CNS by damaging the neuronal tissue. Moreover, MTX interferes with the metabolic pathways of folates, excitatory amino acids, homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine, adenosine and biopterins, inducing biochemical alterations which have been associated with neurotoxic symptoms. It has been suggested that acute toxicity is partly mediated by adenosine, whereas homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine, excitatory amino acids and biopterins may play an important role in the development of subacute and chronic toxicity. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of MTX neurotoxicity would offer the possibility of developing new therapeutic strategies for its treatment or prevention. Copyright Â© 2003 S.

4810,"Nucleus- and species-specific properties of the slow (<1 Hz) sleep oscillation in thalamocortical neurons The slow (<1 Hz) rhythm is an electroencephalogram hallmark of resting sleep. In thalamocortical neurons this rhythm correlates with a slow (<1 Hz) oscillation comprising recurring UP and DOWN membrane potential states. Recently, we showed that metabotropic glutamate receptor activation brings about an intrinsic slow oscillation in thalamocortical neurons of the cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in vitro which is identical to that observed in vivo. The aim of this study was to further assess the properties of this oscillation and compare them with those observed in thalamocortical neurons of three other thalamic nuclei in the cat (ventrobasal complex, medial geniculate body; ventral lateral nucleus) and two thalamic nuclei in rats and mice (lateral geniculate nucleus and ventrobasal complex). Slow oscillations were evident in all of these additional structures and shared several basic properties including, i) the stereotypical, rhythmic alternation between distinct UP and DOWN states with the UP state always commencing with a low-threshold Ca2+ potential, and ii) an inverse relationship between frequency and injected current so that slow oscillations always increase in frequency with hyperpolarization, often culminating in delta (delta) activity at approximately 1-4 Hz. However, beyond these common properties there were important differences in expression between different nuclei. Most notably, 44% of slow oscillations in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus possessed UP states that comprised sustained tonic firing and/or high-threshold bursting. In contrast, slow oscillations in cat ventrobasal complex, medial geniculate body and ventral lateral nucleus thalamocortical neurons exhibited such UP states in only 16%, 11% and 10% of cases, respectively, whereas slow oscillations in the lateral geniculate nucleus and ventrobasal complex of rats and mice did so in <12% of cases. Thus, the slow oscillation is a common feature of thalamocortical neurons that displays clear species- and nuclei-related differences. The potential functional significance of these results is discussed.",Excluded
4399,"Pulmonary tissue volume, cardiac output, and diffusing capacity in sustained microgravity In microgravity (microG) humans have marked changes in body fluids, with a combination of an overall fluid loss and a redistribution of fluids in the cranial direction. We investigated whether interstitial pulmonary edema develops as a result of a headward fluid shift or whether pulmonary tissue fluid volume is reduced as a result of the overall loss of body fluid. We measured pulmonary tissue volume (Vti), capillary blood flow, and diffusing capacity in four subjects before, during, and after 10 days of exposure to microG during spaceflight. Measurements were made by rebreathing a gas mixture containing small amounts of acetylene, carbon monoxide, and argon. Measurements made early in flight in two subjects showed no change in Vti despite large increases in stroke volume (40%) and diffusing capacity (13%) consistent with increased pulmonary capillary blood volume. Late in-flight measurements in four subjects showed a 25% reduction in Vti compared with preflight controls (P < 0.001). There was a concomittant reduction in stroke volume, to the extent that it was no longer significantly different from preflight control. Diffusing capacity remained elevated (11%; P < 0.05) late in flight. These findings suggest that, despite increased pulmonary perfusion and pulmonary capillary blood volume, interstitial pulmonary edema does not result from exposure to microG.",Excluded

4196,"Differences in the DNA supercoiling response of irradiated cell lines from ataxia-telangiectasia versus unaffected individuals In this study the manifestation of DNA damage at the nucleoid level was examined in several AT cell lines using an image analysis system to directly visualize and measure the changes in DNA loop size which occur when increasing concentrations of propidium iodide (PI) are used to titrate the DNA supercoiling response (the 'fluorescent halo assay'). This response consists of a relaxation (0.5-7.5 micrograms/ml PI) and rewinding phase (10-50 micrograms/ml PI), the latter of which is impaired by the presence of DNA strand breaks in irradiated cells. In addition to the inhibition of DNA rewinding seen immediately after irradiation at 0 degrees C, the supercoiling response of AT diploid fibroblasts indicated an increased amount of DNA unwinding compared to fibroblasts from unaffected individuals. This difference appeared to saturate, since the excess in DNA loop size over that seen in irradiated fibroblasts from unaffected individuals remained constant after 5 Gy. These results may reflect a greater instability of the DNA-nuclear matrix attachment points in irradiated AT fibroblasts. The DNA supercoiling response in irradiated transformed AT fibroblasts and AT lymphoblasts did not differ from that observed in unaffected cells of the same type. However, all of the immortalized cell lines (AT and unaffected) had inherently larger DNA loop sizes than diploid fibroblasts and exhibited excess unwinding after irradiation.",Excluded
4000,"Duration of fluoroscopic-guided spine interventions and radiation exposure is increased in overweight patients BACKGROUND: The impact of patient body mass index (BMI) on image-guided spine interventions remains unknown. Higher BMI is known to complicate the acquisition of radiographic images. Therefore it can be hypothesized that the patient's body habitus can influence the delivery of a spinal injection.OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of patient BMI on the length of fluoroscopy and procedure times during spine interventions.DESIGN: Secondary analysis of 2 prospective observational studies.SETTING: All injections were performed in an outpatient university setting.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 209 patients in whom spine injections were performed (99 women), with a mean age of 54.6 years.METHODS: The fluoroscopy times for 202 participants and total procedure times for 137 participants were recorded. Additional participant characteristics, including age, gender, BMI, and actual procedures performed, also were collected. Analysis of covariance and linear and nonlinear model analysis were performed to assess the effect of BMI on fluoroscopy and procedure times.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Fluoroscopy time and procedure duration times.RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 54.6 years, 51% were men, and 77% (n = 155) were overweight (BMI >=25). Participants received the following interventions: 40 zygapophyseal joint injections, 33 medial branch nerve blocks, 113 transforaminal epidural injections, and 16 combined zygapophyseal joint injections and epidural injections. Gender, procedure number, and procedure type did not differ between groups. The overweight group demonstrated a 30% increase in mean fluoroscopy time and a 35% increase in mean procedure time. Controlling for other variables, we found that differences in fluoroscopy time and procedure time were significant (P = .032 and P = .031, respectively) between the 2 groups.CONCLUSIONS: Significantly prolonged procedure time and fluoroscopy time in overweight patients increase the risks associated with spine interventions, not only to the patients but also to the operating room staff exposed to ionizing radiation.",Excluded

4789,"Photoresponse diversity among the five types of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) mediate non-image-forming visual responses, including pupillary constriction, circadian photoentrainment and suppression of pineal melatonin secretion. Five morphological types of ipRGCs, M1-M5, have been identified in mice. In order to understand their functions better, we studied the photoresponses of all five cell types, by whole-cell recording from fluorescently labelled ipRGCs visualized using multiphoton microscopy. All ipRGC types generated melanopsin-based ('intrinsic') as well as synaptically driven ('extrinsic') light responses. The intrinsic photoresponses of M1 cells were lower threshold, higher amplitude and faster than those of M2-M5. The peak amplitudes of extrinsic light responses differed among the ipRGC types; however, the responses of all cell types had comparable thresholds, kinetics and waveforms, and all cells received rod input. While all five types exhibited inhibitory amacrine-cell and excitatory bipolar-cell inputs from the 'on' channel, M1 and M3 received additional 'off'-channel inhibition, possibly through their 'off'-sublamina dendrites. The M2-M5 ipRGCs had centre-surround-organized receptive fields, implicating a capacity to detect spatial contrast. In contrast, the receptive fields of M1 cells lacked surround antagonism, which might be caused by the surround of the inhibitory input nullifying the surround of the excitatory input. All ipRGCs responded robustly to a wide range of motion speeds, and M1-M4 cells appeared tuned to different speeds, suggesting that they might analyse the speed of motion. Retrograde labelling revealed that M1-M4 cells project to the superior colliculus, suggesting that the contrast and motion information signalled by these cells could be used by this sensorimotor area to detect novel objects and motion in the visual field.",Excluded

Statocyst neurons (hair cells) mediate classical conditioning, whereas RPeD1 is a site of memory formation induced by operant conditioning of aerial respiration. Because potassium (K(+)) channels play a critical role in neuronal excitability, we initiated studies on these channels in the aforementioned neurons. Three distinct K(+) currents are expressed in the soma of both the hair cells and RPeD1. In hair cells and RPeD1, there is a fast activating and rapidly inactivating 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-sensitive A current (I(A)), a tetraethyl ammonium (TEA)-sensitive delayed rectifying current, which exhibits slow inactivation kinetics (I(KV)), and a TEA- and 4-AP-insensitive Ca(2+)-dependent current (I(Ca-K)). In hair cells, the activation voltage of I(A); its half-maximal steady-state activation voltage and its half-maximal steady-state inactivation were at more depolarized levels than in RPeD1. The time constant of recovery from I(A) inactivation was slightly faster in hair cells. I(A) in hair cells is also smaller in amplitude than in RPeD1 and is activated at more depolarized potentials. In like manner, I(KV) is smaller in hair cells and is activated at more depolarized potentials than in RPeD1.",Excluded
4072,"Self-rotations in simulated microgravity: performance effects of strategy training INTRODUCTION: This research studies reorientation methodologies in a simulated microgravity environment using an experimental framework to reduce astronaut adaptation time and provide for a safety countermeasure during extravehicular activity.METHODS: There were 20 subjects (10 men, 10 women, mean age of 23.6 +/- 3.5) who were divided into 2 groups, fully trained and minimally trained, which determined the amount of motion strategy training received. Subjects performed a total of 48 rotations about their pitch, roll, and yaw axes in a suspension system that simulated microgravity. In each trial subjects either rotated 90 degrees in pitch, 90 degrees in roll, or 180 degrees in yaw. Experimental measures include subject coordination, performance time, cognitive workload assessments, and qualitative motion control strategies.RESULTS: Subjects in the fully trained group had better initial performance with respect to performance time and workload scores for the pitch and yaw rotations. Further, trained subjects reached a steady-state performance time in fewer trials than those with minimal training. The subjects with minimal training tended to use motions that were common in an Earth environment since no technique was provided. For roll rotations they developed motions that would have led to significant off-axis (pitch and yaw) rotations in a true microgravity environment.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that certain body axes are easier to rotate about than others and that fully trained subjects had an easier time performing the body rotations than the minimally trained subjects. This study has provided the groundwork for the development of an astronaut motion-control training program.",Excluded
4665,"Noisy vestibular stimulation improves autonomic and motor responsiveness in central neurodegenerative disorders The vestibular nerves are known to influence neuronal circuits in the medullary cardiovascular areas and, through the cerebellar vermis, the basal ganglia and the limbic system. By means of noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), it might be possible to ameliorate blunted responsiveness of degenerated neuronal circuits of patients with multi system atrophy or Parkinson's disease, or both. We evaluated the effect of 24-hour noisy GVS on long-term heart rate dynamics in 7 patients with multi system atrophy and on daytime trunk activity dynamics in 12 patients with either levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease or levodopa-unresponsive parkinsonism. Six of the latter patients were also examined for cognitive performance by means of a continuous performance test. Short-range or high-frequency fluctuations of heart rate were significantly increased by the noisy GVS compared with sham stimulation, suggestive of improved autonomic, especially parasympathetic, responsiveness. Long-range antipersistency of trunk activity patterns probed by an autocorrelation measure was significantly increased by the noisy GVS, suggestive of quickening of bradykinesic rest-to-active transitions. The mean reaction time of the continuous performance test was also significantly decreased by the noisy GVS, without significant changes in either the omission or commission error ratios, which is suggestive of improved motor execution during the cognitive task. In conclusion, the noisy GVS is effective in boosting the neurodegenerative brains of patients with multi system atrophy or Parkinson's disease, or both, including those unresponsive to standard levodopa therapy; it is also effective in improving these patients' autonomic and motor responsiveness.",Excluded
4322,"Focal, high dose, and fractionated modified stereotactic radiation therapy for lung carcinoma patients: a preliminary experience BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiation therapy is highly effective in the treatment of small brain metastases, regardless of the histology. This suggests that small extracranial malignancies may be curable with similar radiation therapy. The authors developed a novel treatment unit for administering such therapy.METHODS: The unit consisted of a linear accelerator (linac), an X-ray simulator (X-S), computed tomography (CT), and a table. The gantry axes of the three machines were coaxial and could be matched by rotating the table. Patients were instructed to perform shallow respiration with oxygen. The motion of the tumor was monitored with the X-S. When the motion was slight enough, the table was rotated to the CT. To include all geometric movement on the CT images, each scan was made while the patient was performing shallow respiration. After the CT positioning, the table was rotated to the linac, and non-coplanar treatment was given. Beginning in October 1994, 45 patients with 23 primary or 43 metastatic lung carcinomas were treated. Radiation doses at the 80% isodose line were 30-75 gray in 5-15 fractions over 1-3 weeks with or without conventional radiation therapy.RESULTS: The treatment was performed with no or minimal adverse acute symptoms. The daily treatment time was short. During a median follow-up of 11 months, local progression occurred in 2 of 66 lesions. Interstitial changes in the lung were limited.CONCLUSIONS: With this unit and procedure, focal radiation therapy similar to stereotactic radiation therapy is possible for extracranial sites.

4050,"Gamma Knife surgery for patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas: Predictors of tumor control, neurological deficits, and hypopituitarism - Clinical article Object. Nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas often recur after microsurgery and thereby require further treatment. Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) has been used to treat recurrent adenomas. In this study, the authors evaluated outcomes following GKS of nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas and assessed predictors of tumor control, neurological deficits, and delayed hypopituitarism. Methods. Between June 1989 and March 2010, 140 consecutive patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas were treated using GKS at the University of Virginia. The median patient age was 51 years (range 21-82 years), and 56% of patients were male. Mean tumor volume was 5.6 cm3 (range 0.6-35 cm3). Thirteen patients were treated with GKS as primary therapy, and 127 had undergone at least 1 open resection prior to GKS. Ninety-three patients had a history of hormone therapy prior to GKS. The mean maximal dose of GKS was 38.6 Gy (range 10-70 Gy), the mean marginal dose was 18 Gy (range 5-25 Gy), and the mean number of isocenters was 9.8 (range 1-26). Follow-up evaluations were performed in all 140 patients, ranging from 0.5 to 17 years (mean 5 years, median 4.2 years). Results. Tumor volume remained stable or decreased in 113 (90%) of 125 patients with available follow-up imaging. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated radiographic progression free survival at 2, 5, 8, and 10 years to be 98%, 97%, 91%, and 87%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, a tumor volume greater than 5 cm3 (hazard ratio = 5.0, 95% CI 1.5-17.2; p = 0.023) was the only factor predictive of tumor growth. The median time to tumor progression was 14.5 years. Delayed hypopituitarism occurred in 30.3% of patients. No factor was predictive of post-GKS hypopituitarism. A new or worsening cranial nerve deficit occurred in 16 (13.7%) of 117 patients. Visual decline was the most common neurological deficit (12.8%), and all patients experiencing visual decline had evidence of tumor progression. In multivariate analysis, a tumor volume greater than 5 cm3 (OR = 3.7, 95% CI 1.2-11.7; p = 0.025) and pre-GKS hypopituitarism (OR = 7.5, 95% CI 1.1-60.8; p = 0.05) were predictive of a new or worsened neurological deficit. Conclusions. In patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas, GKS confers a high rate of tumor control and a low rate of neurological deficits. The most common complication following GKS is delayed hypopituitarism, and this occurs in a minority of patients.",Excluded
4075,"Single needle approach for multiple medial branch blocks: a new technique BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Medial branch blocks are an important tool for the diagnosis of facet joint arthropathy. The most commonly used technique involves multiple needle placements, one for each nerve blocked. This multiple needle technique may require a large amount of local anesthetic for anesthetizing the skin, thereby increasing the rate of false-positive blocks.TECHNIQUE: Diagnostic lumbar medial branch blocks are usually performed using multiple needles, one for each branch. The authors describe a different technique using a single needle for all levels. Initially, the needle is directed toward the medial branch located at the level of the affected facet joint in the antero-posterior view. After anesthetizing this nerve with local anesthetic, the same needle is withdrawn to the skin with the tip still in the subcutaneous tissue and repositioned to block the medial branch above, and thereafter below, while continuing to use only the antero-posterior view, thereby using only one entry site.CONCLUSIONS: When performed correctly, the single needle technique provides accuracy similar to the more conventional multiple needle approach during the performance of diagnostic facet joint nerve blocks. Because only one skin entry point is needed, however, this technique may afford several advantages over the multiple needle approach. These may include less patient discomfort, less time required and less radiation exposure since only one C-arm position is used, a smaller volume of local anesthetic, and possibly a lower incidence of false-positive blocks.",Excluded
3810,"Intrinsic and extrinsic light responses in melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells during mouse development Melanopsin (Opn4) is a photopigment found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that project to various brain areas. These neurons are intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs) and are implicated in nonimage-forming responses to environmental light such as the pupillary light reflex and circadian entrainment. Recent evidence indicates that ipRGCs respond to light at birth, but questions remain as to whether and when they undergo significant functional changes. We used bacterial artificial chromosome transgenesis to engineer a mouse line in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is expressed under the control of the melanopsin promoter. Double immunolabeling for EGFP and melanopsin demonstrates their colocalization in ganglion cells of mutant mouse retinas. Electrophysiological recordings of ipRGCs in neonatal mice (postnatal day 0 [P0] to P7) demonstrated that these cells responded to light with small and sluggish depolarization. However, starting at P11 we observed ipRGCs that responded to light with a larger and faster onset (<1 s) and offset (<1 s) depolarization. These faster, larger depolarizations were observed in most ipRGCs by early adult ages. However, on application of a cocktail of synaptic blockers, we found that all cells responded to light with slow onset (>2.5 s) and offset (>10 s) depolarization, revealing the intrinsic, melanopsin-mediated light responses. The extrinsic, cone/rod influence on ipRGCs correlates with their extensive dendritic stratification in the inner plexiform layer. Collectively, these results demonstrate that ipRGCs make use of melanopsin for phototransduction before eye opening and that these cells further integrate signals derived from the outer retina as the retina matures.",Excluded

Evaluation of cellular proliferation following one day after laser treatment revealed significant decrease in cell proliferation compared to control group. However on day 7, significant increase in proliferation was found in both the irradiated groups in comparison with the control group. No significant difference was found between the laser treated groups. Treatment of SCs with laser resulted in significant increase in NGF gene expression on day 20.

Conclusion(s): This multicenter retrospective study supports the role of adjuvant PORT in terms of disease control and survival in adult grade II-III IEPNs. Prospective randomized trials focused on individualized treatment based on molecular subtypes is warranted. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Included
4747,"The PET Radioligand 18F-FIMX Images and Quantifies Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 1 in Proportion to the Regional Density of Its Gene Transcript in Human Brain UNLABELLED: A recent study from our laboratory found that (18)F-FIMX is an excellent PET radioligand for quantifying metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) in monkey brain. This study evaluated the ability of (18)F-FIMX to quantify mGluR1 in humans. A second goal was to use the relative density of mGluR1 gene transcripts in brain regions to estimate specific uptake and nondisplaceable uptake (VND) in each brain region.METHODS: After injection of 189 +/- 3 MBq of (18)F-FIMX, 12 healthy volunteers underwent a dynamic PET scan over 120 min. For 6 volunteers, images were acquired until 210 min. A metabolite-corrected arterial input function was measured from the radial artery. Four other subjects underwent whole-body scanning to estimate radiation exposure.RESULTS: (18)F-FIMX uptake into the human brain was high (SUV = 4-6 in the cerebellum), peaked at about 10 min, and washed out rapidly. An unconstrained 2-tissue-compartment model fitted the data well, and distribution volume (VT) (mLcm(-3)) values ranged from 1.5 in the caudate to 11 in the cerebellum. A 120-min scan provided stable VT values in all regions except the cerebellum, for which an acquisition time of at least 170 min was necessary. VT values in brain regions correlated well with mGluR1 transcript density, and the correlation suggested that VND of (18)F-FIMX was quite low (0.5 mLcm(-3)). This measure of VND in humans was similar to that from a receptor blocking study in monkeys, after correcting for differences in plasma protein binding. Similar to other (18)F-labeled ligands, the effective dose was about 23 muSv/MBq.CONCLUSION: (18)F-FIMX can quantify mGluR1 in the human brain with a 120- to 170-min scan. Correlation of brain uptake with the relative density of mGluR1 transcript allows specific receptor binding of a radioligand to be quantified without injecting pharmacologic doses of a blocking agent.",Excluded
4527,"Dorsal light response and changes of its responses under varying acceleration conditions In order to improve our understanding about functions of the gravity sensors, we have conducted four experiments in goldfish: 1) To define the effect of visual information influx on the static labyrinthine response, the dorsal light response (DLR) which had been proposed by von Holst as a model for postural adjustment in fish was reexamined with a newly designed, rotatory illumination device. The fish responded to illumination from the upper half of the visual field and a narrow range around 180 degrees of the lower half visual field. The maximal tilting angle of normal fish was about 40 degrees under horizontal illumination. 2) Under the changes of the gravito-inertial force level produced by a linear sled, the threshold of the gravity sensors was determined from postural adjustment responses. 3) Under hypogravic conditions during the parabolic flight of an airplane, the light-dependent behavior was investigated in intact and labyrinthectomized goldfish. 4) As one of the most likely candidates of the neural centers for the DLR, the valvula cerebelli, which receives its visual information not through the optic tectum but through the pretectal areas, is confirmed by the brain lesion experiments.",Excluded
4720,"Feasibility of 5-mm vs 2.5-mm width multileaf collimator in noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc stereotactic radiotherapy for multiple brain metastases The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc stereotactic radiotherapy (VMAT-SRT) using a 5-mm multileaf collimator (MLC) for multiple brain metastases. We identified 34 multiple-target cases (3 to 19 targets in each case) with a total of 257 of targets and constructed noncoplanar VMAT-SRT plans using 5-mm and 2.5-mm MLCs with 4-arc. The prescribed dose was 36 Gy/6 fr. Plans were evaluated using the Paddick conformity indices (PCI), Paddick gradient index (PGI), and normal brain dose (NBD, equal to the mean brain dose minus gross tumor volume). There were no significant differences in PCI (median [range]: 5 mm, 0.88 [0.78 to 0.94]; 2.5 mm, 0.89 [0.78 to 0.94]; p= 0.691), PGI (median [range]: 5 mm, 3.96 [2.21 to 6.63]; 2.5 mm, 3.96 [2.24 to 6.45]; p= 0.358), or NBD (median [range]: 5 mm, 7.5 Gy [2.5 to 12.4]; 2.5 mm, 7.5 Gy [2.5 to 12.5]; p= 0.675). The performance of the 5-mm MLC was not inferior to the 2.5-mm MLC in applications of noncoplanar VMAT-SRT for multiple brain metastases with regards to dose conformity, gradient, and NBD. This study provides the necessary background for generalizing noncoplanar VMAT-SRT approaches in treating multiple brain lesions.

4168,"Evaluation of novel modified tangential irradiation technique for breast cancer patients using dose-volume histograms Purpose We have previously reported that entire axillary lymph node regions could be irradiated by the modified tangential irradiation technique (MTIT). In this study, MTIT was compared with a conventional irradiation technique (CTIT) using dose-volume histograms to verify how adequately MTIT covers the breast and axillary lymph node region and the extent to which it involves the lung and heart. Methods and materials Forty-four patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated by lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and postoperative radiotherapy. Twenty-two patients were treated with MTIT and 22 with CTIT. In 25 patients, the breast tumor was on the left and in 19 on the right. During axillary dissection, surgical clips were left as markers at the border of the axillary lymph node region. MTIT was planned by setting the dorsal edge of the radiation field on a lateral-view simulator film at the dorsal edge of the humeral head and the cranial edge of the radiation field at the caudal edge of the humeral head. CTIT was planned to ensure radiation of the breast tissue without considering the axillary region. In this study, all patients underwent computed tomography, and the CT data were transmitted on-line to a radiotherapy planning system, in which the dose-distribution computed tomography images and dose-volume histograms were calculated by defining the breast, axillary region (levels I, II, and III), lung, and heart region. Results Dose-volume histogram analysis demonstrated that breast tissue was radiated with an 86.5-100% volume (median 96.5%) by MTIT and an 83-100% volume (median, 95%) by CTIT at >95% of the isocenter dose. The axillary lymph node regions at Levels I, II, and III were irradiated with 84-100% (median, 94.5%), 59-100% (median, 89%), and 70-100% (median, 89.5%) volumes, respectively, by MTIT and with 2-84% (median, 38%), 0-53% (median, 15%), and 0-31% (median, 0%) volumes, respectively, by CTIT at >70% of the isocenter dose. The ipsilateral lung was irradiated with a 5-22% volume (median, 11.5%) by MTIT and 5-15% volume (median 9%) by CTIT at >90% of the isocenter dose. In all 25 left-sided breast cancer patients, the volumes irradiated with an 80% isocenter dose were <30 cm<sup>3</sup>. Conclusion The results of our study demonstrated that the breast tissue was sufficiently irradiated with both CTIT and MTIT planning, the axillary lymph node areas irradiated by MTIT were much wider than those irradiated by CTIT at all levels, and the lung and heart volumes irradiated by MTIT were small.

3806,"Electric field stimulation of precision-cut lung slices The precision-cut lung slice (PCLS) technique is widely used to examine airway responses in different species. We developed a method to study nerve-dependent bronchoconstriction by the application of electric field stimulation (EFS) to PCLS. PCLS prepared from Wistar rats were placed between two platinum electrodes to apply serial rectangular impulses (5-100 Hz), and bronchoconstriction was studied by videomicroscopy. The extent of airway contractions increased with higher frequencies. Stable repeated airway contractions were obtained at a frequency of 50 Hz, a width of 1 ms, and an output of 200 mA for 2.5 s each minute. Larger airways showed stronger responses. The EFS-triggered contractions were increased by the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor neostigmine (10 muM) and reversed by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (10 muM), whereas the thromboxane protanoid receptor antagonist SQ29548 (10 muM) had no effect. Magnesium ions (10 mM) antagonized airway contractions induced by EFS, but not by methacholine, indicating that nerve endings remain intact in PCLS. Our data further show that the electrically evoked airway contractions in PCLS are mediated by cholinergic nerves, independent of thromboxane and more prominent in larger airways. Taken together these findings show that nerve endings remain intact in PCLS, and they suggest that the present method is useful to study neurogenic responses in airways of different size.

3843,"High resolution dual-tracer brain SPECT with a new highperformance CdTe detector Aims: Simultaneous dual-tracer brain imaging has the potential to shorten patient pathways in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, but the poor spectral resolution of conventional gamma cameras limits the utility of this technique. Solid state detectors offer improved capability to distinguish between two radioisotopes, and this has been exploited clinically in the field of nuclear cardiology. However, the technology has yet to be fully evaluated in the field of scintigraphic neuroimaging. We present imaging results for a new small-pixel CdTe detector in simultaneous dual-radioisotope scintigraphy of a brain phantom. Method(s): We have developed a new high-performance CdTe detector with an array of 80x80 pixels on a 250mum pitch, capable of imaging x-rays and gamma rays up to 200keV. The detector is fully spectroscopic, recording the energy of every interaction in each pixel of the detector, and the small pixel size affords very high spatial- and spectral- resolution. The detector has a wide range of applications in medical imaging, including x-ray diffraction tomography, x-ray k-edge subtraction and highresolution nuclear medicine imaging. The new detector has been characterised for radionuclide imaging. Using pinhole collimation, images have been acquired of a brain phantom containing both I-123 and Tc-99m. The hyperspectral dataset was subjected to corrections for inter-pixel charge sharing, variations in energy and uniformity response, and bad pixel interpolation. Images were created by applying energy windows to the spectral data. Images and spectra of the same phantom were also acquired with a conventional clinical gamma camera for comparison. For each image, the contrast and cross-talk between the two energy windows were quantified using regions of interest. Result(s): The CdTe system exhibits improved scatter rejection and greatly reduced cross-talk between the energy windows for the two radioisotopes, resulting in enhanced image contrast. These characteristics will allow for better accuracy for quantitative imaging in a dual-tracer setting, which has particular importance in brain imaging. We also demonstrate the ability of the detector to resolve low-energy fluorescence x-rays from the radioactive source. The system has a high efficiency for detection of these low-energy photons, and incorporating these events into image reconstruction may boost the sensitivity, reducing image noise. Conclusion(s): Small-pixel CdTe detectors are a promising prospect in multi-tracer SPECT imaging. We present future plans to develop the instrument, with a tiled array of detectors with minimal dead-space to increase the field of view and improved collimators to further increase the sensitivity of the system.",Excluded
3744,"Radiation induction of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene Ptk-3 in normal rat astrocytes Radiation-induced gene expression was examined in rat astrocyte cultures using differential display of mRNA via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. A 0.3-kb cDNA that was consistently observed in irradiated cultures but not in unirradiated cultures was cloned and sequenced. It was found to be identical to Ptk-3, a receptor tyrosine kinase gene identified recently. The protein encoded by Ptk-3 is a member of a novel class of receptor tyrosine kinases whose extracellular domain contains regions of homology with coagulation factors V and VIII and complement component C1. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of Ptk-3 was increased in rat astrocytes by 0.5 h after exposure to 10 Gy and remained at the same elevated level for at least 24 h. The maximum increase occurred after 5 Gy. Cloning studies indicated the presence of at least two Ptk-3 mRNA transcripts, which are probably the result of an alternative splicing mechanism. The short isoform lacks a 37-amino acid sequence in the glycine/proline-rich juxtamembrane region. The splicing pattern of the Ptk-3 gene was not altered by radiation. However, the ratios of the longer to the shorter mRNA transcripts differed between adult cortex, neonatal cortex and in vitro astrocyte cultures.",Included

3723,"Cytogenetic comparison of the sensitivity to mutagens in mice selected for high (HA) and low (LA) swim stress-induced analgesia Sensitivity to mutagens was studied in mouse lines selectively bred for high analgesia (HA) and for low analgesia (LA) induced by 3-min swimming in 20 degrees C water. Apart from pain-related traits HA mice also manifest, as compared to the LA line, higher emotionality in various behavioural tests, and cope worse with the hypothermic challenge of swimming in cold water. In the present study HA mice appeared more susceptible to the mutagenic effect of whole-body gamma-radiation and mitomycin-C injection. Both treatments caused higher frequencies of chromosomal aberrations and micronucleus in bone marrow cells in the HA than in the LA line. The results are discussed in terms of a genetic correlation between animals' susceptibility to environmental stressors and the mechanism of mutagenesis. As shown by our recent molecular study, the selection for magnitude of swim analgesia has differentiated the parental outbred population into two distinct genotypes characterised by specific minisatellite and microsatellite sequences for each line, which may be genetic markers of particular traits. We conceive that the breeding strategy, along with the differentiation of stress-related phenomena, has altered the frequencies of genes controlling DNA repair in each line.",Excluded

3654,"Optogenetic disruption of sleep continuity impairs memory consolidation Memory consolidation has been proposed as a function of sleep. However, sleep is a complex phenomenon characterized by several features including duration, intensity, and continuity. Sleep continuity is disrupted in different neurological and psychiatric conditions, many of which are accompanied by memory deficits. This finding has raised the question of whether the continuity of sleep is important for memory consolidation. However, current techniques used in sleep research cannot manipulate a single sleep feature while maintaining the others constant. Here, we introduce the use of optogenetics to investigate the role of sleep continuity in memory consolidation. We optogenetically targeted hypocretin/orexin neurons, which play a key role in arousal processes. We used optogenetics to activate these neurons at different intervals in behaving mice and were able to fragment sleep without affecting its overall amount or intensity. Fragmenting sleep after the learning phase of the novel object recognition (NOR) task significantly decreased the performance of mice on the subsequent day, but memory was unaffected if the average duration of sleep episodes was maintained at 62-73% of normal. These findings demonstrate the use of optogenetic activation of arousal-related nuclei as a way to systematically manipulate a specific feature of sleep. We conclude that regardless of the total amount of sleep or sleep intensity, a minimal unit of uninterrupted sleep is crucial for memory consolidation.",Excluded
4828,"Angiographic features, collaterals, and infarct topography of symptomatic occlusive radiation vasculopathy: a case-referent study BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Occlusive radiation vasculopathy (ORV) predisposes head-and-neck cancer survivors to ischemic strokes.METHODS: We analyzed the digital subtraction angiography acquired in 96 patients who had first-ever transient ischemic attack or ischemic strokes attributed to ORV. Another age-matched 115 patients who had no radiotherapy but symptomatic high-grade (>70%) carotid stenoses were enrolled as referent subjects. Digital subtraction angiography was performed within 2 months from stroke onset and delineated carotid and vertebrobasilar circulations from aortic arch up to intracranial branches. Two reviewers blinded to group assignment recorded all vascular lesions, collateral status, and infarct pattern.RESULTS: ORV patients had less atherosclerotic risk factors at presentation. In referent patients, high-grade stenoses were mostly focal at the proximal internal carotid artery. In contrast, high-grade ORV lesions diffusely involved the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery and were more frequently bilateral (54% versus 22%), tandem (23% versus 10%), associated with complete occlusion in one or both carotid arteries (30% versus 9%), vertebral artery (VA) steno-occlusions (28% versus 16%), and external carotid artery stenosis (19% versus 5%) (all P<0.05). With comparable rates of vascular anomaly, ORV patients showed more established collateral circulations through leptomeningeal arteries, anterior communicating artery, posterior communicating artery, suboccipital/costocervical artery, and retrograde flow in ophthalmic artery. In terms of infarct topography, the frequencies of cortical or subcortical watershed infarcts were similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: ORV angiographic features and corresponding collaterals are distinct from atherosclerotic patterns at initial stroke presentation.

3971,"Achieving sub cm CTV-PTV margin in pelvic treatments: Radiographers learning curve Aims: Image guidance is not always feasible or available for standard/ conformal treatments and so, offline portal image measurements help define population based CTV-PTV margins. Reproducibility in pelvis is aided by the use of ankle- and/or knee-indexed supports available in standard sizes generally suiting the needs of taller western patients. Radiographers need to be convinced of the importance for use of one/more positional devices as this adds to setup effort and time. Different permutations of aligning the pelvis and positional aids, resident supervised or not are reported for patients treated for cancer of the cervix/endometrium. Method(s): Patients were aligned using lasers/field lights to either anterior field center (conventional alignment) or to mid line tattoo over mons pubis keeping constant 10 cm table top to vertical height for all setups using either standard ankle or knee plus ankle positioning device. Localization CT scanbased digitally reconstructed radiographs were used as reference to compare with portal imaging acquired generally in pattern of 3 in 1st week and weekly thereafter. The van Herk formula was used to compute CTV-PTV margin from anterior and lateral image projections to give mediolateral (ML), cranio-caudal (CC) and antero-posterior (AP) margins. Result(s): The initial pelvic alignment were done in the presence of a resident doctor using ankle positioning by two different alignment methods: conventional and setup (4 cm cranial offset from reference tattoo at mons pubis). The corresponding PTV margin in ML direction was 1.6 cm versus 0.9 cm, CC 1.2 cm versus 1.1 cm respectively and in AP was identical at 0.7 cm. Subsequently, with radiographers by themselves, PTV margins were 1.1 cm versus 0.9 cm for ML, 1.1 cm versus 1.5 cm, CC and 1.0 cm versus 0.9 cm in AP direction for conventional and setup alignment respectively. An increase in CC margin was seen for setup arm. The radiographers were given feedback and setup reproducibility was assessed for next 13 patients treated with a similar setup protocol. The PTV margins for this group in CC showed improvement to 1.1 cm, ML was 0.9 cm and 0.9 cm in AP directions. A knee-positioning device was introduced with ankle for patient alignment with setup protocol. An increase in PTV margin to 1.4 cm was calculated for ML with modest decrease in CC at 0.8 cm and 0.9 cm for AP direction with use of two devices. The standard knee device was abandoned as use of two devices was perceived as cumbersome and unsuitable in height for patients. A third technique of alignment keeping treatment center at tattooed reference plane (mons pubis) using ankle device was studied. The PTV margins for ML, CC, AP directions were within a cm-0.8 cm, 0.9 cm, 0.9 cm respectively which is now the current practice. Conclusion(s): There is a radiographer learning curve.

4714,"Roles of DNA-dependent protein kinase and ATM in cell-cycle-dependent radiation sensitivity in human cells PURPOSE: The roles of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and ATM in the cell-cycle-dependent radiosensitivity in human cells were investigated.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A DNA-PK activity-deficient human glioblastoma cell line M059J, ataxia telangiectasia cell lines AT3BISV and AT5BIVA, and control cell lines were used. Wortmannin inhibited DNA-PK and ATM activities. Cells were synchronized by hydroxyurea. Progression through the cell cycle was analysed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: M059J exhibited hyper-radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle, with extreme hyper-radiosensitivity in G to early S-phase compared with the control cell line M059K. AT3BISV and AT5BIVA exhibited hyper-radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle but showed a similar pattern of cell-cycle-dependent radiosensitivity to that observed in LM217 or HeLa cells. In AT3BISV and AT5BIVA, radiosensitization by wortmannin was observed throughout the cell cycle and was most prominent in G1 to early S-phase. Wortmannin did not sensitize M059J to ionizing radiation in any cell-cycle phase. DNA-PK activities were not different throughout the cell cycle.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that (1) non-homologous endjoining plays a dominant role in G1 to early S-phase and a minor role in late S to G2-phase in repairing DNA double-strand breaks, (2) the role of ATM in repairing double-strand breaks may be almost cell-cycle-independent and (3) the dominant role of non-homologous end-joining during G1 to early S-phase is not due to cell-cycle-dependent fluctuations in DNA-PK activity.",Excluded
3972,"Technological solutions to physiological problems: Dipas perspective Indian boundaries are delimited by diverse geographical locations ranging from frozen Himalayan peaks lacking oxygen to hot and dry deserts to hot and humid coastal areas to dense jungles. Indian soldiers are deployed in these varied environmental conditions and are subject to the detrimental effects of these extreme environmental excesses. In addition, the noise and radiation exposure of the troops is a significant occupational hazard. The troops of the Indian Defence Forces are not only expected to survive these extremes but also to perform physically and mentally to discharge their military duties effectively. DIPAS has been working in the field of military physiology for past fifty years with the primary mandate of promoting human performance in extreme environments. Neurophysiological mechanisms of anorexia, High Altitude Pulmonary Edema, cold injuries, memory impairment, sleep pattern at high altitude have been elucidated for developing preventive/therapeutic measures. We have undertaken various approaches to devise strategies and productsto improve performance of soldiers to combat physiological stresses posed by harsh environments. o Cold, hypoxic environment of High Altitude: For treating patients of AMS and HAPE and for persons visiting high altitude for shorter duration, a system for improving oxygenation is developed in the form of hyperoxic shelters. Nitric Oxide Delivery System for treatment of HAPE has also been optimized along with formulating Aloe Vera based Alocal cream to treat/prevent cold injuries. Acclimatization schedule and tenure of posting to aid in the rapid acclimatization of soldiers to high altitude has been prepared. We have also undertaken sleep studies for ameliorating the effects of sleep deprivation and disturbed sleep at the extremes of altitude. Electrically heated gloves and socks are developed for the extremely cold conditions at HA. Sourja, a self sustained solar shelter designed by DIPAS that can generate power in all weather conditions using solar/wind energy and provides zero energy based habitability under inhospitable environment. Improved Space Heating Devices (Bukhari) have been designed that uses nearly half fuel and does not build CO in the room where it is used, thus making it safe and cost effective. We have tailored Yoga packages for the Armed forces for their performance improvement. o Hot and dry/humid climate of Deserts/Coastal regions/Dense Tropical Jungles: Hypohydration and the resultant loss of water and electrolytes from the body are the major threats to human physiology in these environments. Soldiers need to acclimatize to the heat in order to survive in these border areas. DIPAS has designed Vortex cooling systems for desert operations to combat heat stress. Tanks provide a heated microclimate for the soldier operating in it, to provide comfort to the tank crew operating in extreme hot conditions, we made a solid state cooling garment for the tank crew. o Occupational stress environment: Soldiers are constantly exposed to high intensity noise of firing, aircrafts, tanks, etc and it is imperative to reduce the noise induced hearing loss to safeguard them.

Pregnant rats were exposed to single doses of 0.5 or 1.0 Gy, or to two doses of 0.5 Gy 6 h apart on day 15 of gestation. Offspring were subjected to four behavioral tests on postnatal days 7-28; the rats were then sacrificed and their brains removed and processed for histology. For all end points, the fractionated dose produced an effect that was intermediate between that of the 0.5- and 1.0-Gy doses and which, by interpolation, could be expressed as equivalent to a single dose between 0.5 and 1.0 Gy. The equivalent single dose was not significantly different from the 1.0-Gy dose for negative geotaxis (0.54 Gy), reflex suspension (0.80 Gy), and continuous corridor (0.85 Gy). For sine of the angle of the advance of hind feet (0.58 Gy), width of stride (0.69 Gy), length of stride (0.75 Gy), body weight (0.73 Gy), and cerebral cortex thickness (0.69 Gy), the fractionated dose produced effects significantly different (P < 0.05) from the 1.0-Gy dose.

3825,"Brain tumor stem cells: Molecular characteristics and their impact on therapy Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent primary brain tumor and ranks among the most lethal of human cancers with conventional therapy offering only palliation. Great strides have been made in understanding brain cancer genetics and modeling these tumors with new targeted therapies being tested, but these advances have not translated into substantially improved patient outcomes. Multiple chemotherapeutic agents, including temozolomide, the first-line treatment for glioblastoma, have been developed to kill cancer cells. However, the response to temozolomide in GBM is modest. Radiation is also moderately effective but this approach is plagued by limitations due to collateral radiation damage to healthy brain tissue and development of radioresistance. Therapeutic resistance is attributed at least in part to a cell population within the tumor that possesses stem-like characteristics and tumor propagating capabilities, referred to as cancer stem cells. Within GBM, the intratumoral heterogeneity is derived from a combination of regional genetic variance and a cellular hierarchy often regulated by distinct cancer stem cell niches, most notably perivascular and hypoxic regions. With the recent emergence as a key player in tumor biology, cancer stem cells have symbiotic relationships with the tumor microenvironment, oncogenic signaling pathways, and epigenetic modifications. The origins of cancer stem cells and their contributions to brain tumor growth and therapeutic resistance are under active investigation with novel anti-cancer stem cell therapies offering potential new hope for this lethal disease.

4005,"Outcomes of spine stereotactic body radiation therapy in patients previously treated with conventional radiation Purpose/Objective(s): Spine stereotactic body radiation therapy (sSBRT) is used to treat relapse following conventional radiation (cEBRT). This study seeks to determine the risk factors for local relapse both radiographically and in regards to pain. Materials/Methods: Patients who underwent sSBRT following cEBRT were included in an IRB-approved database. RPA Class, histology, presence of paraspinal disease, multilevel disease (more than 1 spinal level involved), presence of epidural disease, neural foramina involvement, and dosimetric factors (volume, prescription dose, % coverage by the prescription dose, maximum dose, minimum dose) were retrospectively collected. These factors were correlated to radiographic control and pain progression as determined by the Brief Pain Inventory. Result(s): A total of 79 procedures were performed in 65 patients. Median age was 60 years (range: 27-90). Median follow-up was 8.5 months (range: 0-57.7) and median overall survival was 10.5 months. Median prescription dose was 14 Gy (range: 8-25) typically over 1 fraction (range: 1-10). At presentation, 10.1% were asymptomatic, 6.3% had neurological deficits, 72.2% had pain, and 11.4% had pain and neurological deficits. Following sSBRT, pain control was seen in 81% and 78.5% had radiographic control at last follow-up. Median time to pain relief was 0.7 months (range: 0-3.9). RPA Class, histology, presence of paraspinal disease, multilevel disease, presence of epidural disease, and neural foramina involvement did not predict for radiographic control or pain progression. None of the dosimetric factors predicted for radiographic control or pain progression as well. None of the patients in this series developed myelopathy. New vertebral body fracture developed in 8.9% of treatments. Conclusion(s): sSBRT for progression post cEBRT is effective and safe. Pain relief is quick following sSBRT. Our current standard dose is 16 Gy in 1 fraction. These results are consistent with our data for patients treated upfront for spine metastases. Previous cEBRT does not appear to compromise the effectiveness of sSBRT.",Excluded
4256,"Flow effect impacts NIRS, jeopardizing quantification of tissue hemoglobin It has been generally agreed that changes in light transmission detected by NIRS are not exclusively attributable to hemoglobin changes, but also include a contribution from scattering by constituents of the brain tissue, which is not transparent, but turbid. If the light scattering is constant, light transmission can be quantified by an equation similar to Lambert-Beer's law. However, upon brain activation, it is known that the blood flow invariably increases. We have shown that light scattering by blood per se increases flow-dependently, interfering with the measurement of the intrinsic signals from hemoglobin. I call this the flow effect. Here, in responses to Pourtian's comments, I present additional evidence of the flow effect, which arises from RBC aggregation/dispersion, and further point out the inappropriateness of using NIR range wavelengths for the quantification of blood hemoglobin, even though their use is unavoidable in practice, because this wavelength range offers the best transmission through the tissue. In summary, I believe that the NIRS signal is a function of both flow (flow effect, which becomes the predominant contributor when blood flow increases) and metabolism (blood oxygenation change, which becomes accordingly a minor contributor). If the contribution of the flow effect is unknown, any mathematical equation describing the hemoglobin oxygenation is a Pfaffian equation which has no solution. This does not mean that I deny the clinical usefulness of NIRS, which definitely provides an indication of some biological changes in the brain in response to stimuli. However, great care is needed in the interpretation of the signals.",Excluded
3708,"Small-cell lung cancer: Clinical management and unmet needs new perspectives for an old problem Small cell lung cancer is a highly aggressive, difficult to treat neoplasm. Among all lung tumors, small cell lung cancers account for about 20%. Patients typically include heavy smokers in 70s age group, presenting with symptoms such as intrathoracic tumors growth, distant spread or paraneoplastic syndromes at the time of diagnosis. A useful and functional classification divides small cell lung cancers into limited disease and extensive disease. Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy is the standard treatment for limited disease, with improved survival when combined with prophylactic cranial irradiation. Platinum compounds (cisplatin/carboplatin) plus etoposide remain the cornerstone for extensive disease. Nevertheless, despite high chemoand radio-sensitivity of this cancer, nearly all patients relapse within the first two years and the prognosis is extremely poor. A deeper understanding about small cell lung cancer carcinogenesis led to develop and test a considerable number of new and targeted agents but the results are currently weak or insufficient. To date, small cell lung cancer is still a challenge for researchers. In this review, key aspects of small cell lung cancer management and controversial points of standard and new treatments will be discussed. Copyright Â© 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.",Excluded
4803,Irradiated normal brain promotes invasion of glioblastoma through vascular endothelial growth and stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha The significance of irradiated normal brain volume in glioma recurrence is usually ignored by radiotherapists. The whole-brain irradiation (WBI) of 15 Gy in three fractions was delivered to C57BL/6 mice before implantation of GL261 glioma cells. The changes in vascular endothelial growth (VEGF) and stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) after WBI were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Cell invasion assays were performed to study the effects of VEGF and SDF-1alpha. The levels of VEGF and SDF-1alpha in normal brain tissues increased after 15 Gy WBI. The WBI before tumor implantation significantly increased the invasive ability of GL261 cells. VEGF and SDF-1alpha could promote invasion of GL261 cells even after high-dose irradiation. The combination of irradiation and inhibitors such as AMD3100 may prevent irradiation-stimulated dissemination of glioma cells.,Included

The treatment to lesser extent aimed at prolongation of survival but much more at the attempt to alleviate troubles and to spare pain. The indication thus involved medical points of view as well as ethical ones. The radiotherapy of cerebral metastases comprises the whole cranial volume and requires a focal dose of minimally 4000 R within four weeks. In 53% of the patients, the regression of neurological symptoms was considerable, in 18% even complete, partly beginning already after a few days of treatment. The number of recurrences was small.

Early appearance of the signs of disturbances in the central nervous system functional state suggested a stronger affliction, malignant course and fatal outcome of the disease. Ii ARD patients with IV-th and III-rd degree of severity the syndromes observed were these: acute radiation encephalopathy immediately caused by the ionizing irradiation of the CNS, and a secondary radiation-toxic encephalopathy. The hemorrhagic lesioning of CNS and cerebral hemispheres were noted in terminal stages. In rehabilitation phases, neurasthenic and neurovascular syndromes appeared irrespective of the ARD severity.",Included
4609,"A pilot study using dynamic contrast enhanced-MRI as a response biomarker of the radioprotective effect of memantine in patients receiving whole brain radiotherapy PURPOSE: This pilot prospective study sought to determine whether dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) could be used as a clinical imaging biomarker of tissue toxicity from whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT).METHOD: 14 patients who received WBRT were imaged using dynamic contrast enhanced DCE-MRI prior to and at 8-weeks, 16-weeks and 24-weeks after the initiation of WBRT. Twelve of the patients were also enrolled in the RTOG 0614 trial, which randomized patients to the use of placebo or memantine. After the unblinding of the treatments received by RTOG 0614 patients, DCE-MRI measures of tumor tissue and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) vascular permeability (Initial Area Under the Curve (AUC) Blood Adjusted) was analyzed. Cognitive, quality-of-life (QOL) assessment and blood samples were collected according to the patient's ability to tolerate the exams. Circulating endothelial cells (CEC) were measured using flow cytometry.RESULTS: Following WBRT, there was an increasing trend in the vascular permeability of tumors (p=0.09) and NAWM (p=0.06) with time. Memantine significantly (p=0.01) reduced NAWM AUC changes following radiotherapy. Patients on memantine retained (COWA p= 0.03) better cognitive functions than those on placebo. No association was observed between the level of CEC and DCE-MRI changes, time from radiotherapy or memantine use.CONCLUSIONS: DCE-MRI can detect vascular damage secondary to WBRT. Our data suggests that memantine reduces WBRT-induced brain vasculature damages.",Excluded
4612,"Effect of knocking down the insulin receptor on mouse rod responses Previous experiments have shown that the insulin receptor (IR) is expressed in mammalian rods and contributes to the protection of photoreceptors during bright-light exposure. The role of the insulin receptor in the production of the light response is however unknown. We have used suction-electrode recording to examine the responses of rods after conditionally knocking down the insulin receptor. Our results show that these IR knock-down rods have an accelerated decay of the light response and a small decrease in sensitivity by comparison to littermate WT rods. Our results indicate that the insulin receptor may have some role in controlling the rate of rod response decay, but they exclude a major role of the insulin receptor pathway in phototransduction.",Excluded
4177,"Comparison of responses of neurons in the mouse inferior colliculus to current injections, tones of different durations, and sinusoidal amplitude-modulated tones We made in vivo whole cell patch-clamp recordings from the inferior colliculus of young-adult, anesthetized C57/Bl6 mice to compare the responses to constant-current injections with the responses to tones of different duration or to sinusoidal amplitude-modulated (SAM) tones. We observed that voltage-dependent ion channels contributed in several ways to the response to tones. A sustained response to long tones was observed only in cells showing little accommodation during current injection. Cells showing burst-onset firing during current injection showed a small response to SAM tones, whereas burst-sustained cells showed a good response to SAM tones. The hyperpolarization-activated nonselective cation channel I(h) had a special role in shaping the responses: I(h) was associated with an increased excitability, with chopper and pauser responses, and with an afterhyperpolarization following tones. Synaptic properties were more important in determining the responses to tones of different durations. A short-latency inhibitory response appeared to contribute to the long-pass response in some cells and short-pass and band-pass neurons were characterized by their slow recovery from synaptic adaptation. Cells that recovered slowly from synaptic adaptation showed a relatively small response to SAM tones. Our results show an important role for both intrinsic membrane properties -- most notably the presence of I(h) and the extent of accommodation -- and synaptic adaptation in shaping the response to tones in the inferior colliculus.",Excluded
3970,"Pericardial effusion and cardiac hypokinesis associated with longstanding, multi-organ system sarcoidosis Introduction: Sarcoidosis is a multi-organ system granulomatous disorder. Pericardial effusions associated with sarcoidosis are uncommon (19% of cases.) Case Report: A 54-year-old lady was diagnosed with sarcoidosis as a result of a breast biopsy in 2014 that revealed non-caseating granulomas. Since then, the patient has had chronic persistent dyspnea. Also, she has had involvement of cardiac muscle, her neurological system (unable to raise the left arm), spleen, lungs (stage 2, bilateral hilar adenopathy with infiltrates), and bony involvement of hands (arthritis and clubbing.) Often, patients with stage 2 sarcoidosis tend to go into remission spontaneously (40-70%.) In our patient's case, none of her multi-organ system manifestations abated. Up until this point, her lifelong condition has never been treated despite her symptoms because she refused corticosteroids. Superimposed on this patient were additional inflammatory diagnoses: Grave's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, treated lyme disease, second degree heart block, spinal meningitis, tick-borne alpha 1,3 galactose allergy. When we met the patient our focus was patient-centered education. We convinced our patient to accept steroid treatment because PET-MRI imaging may now detect scar vs. inflamed, viable tissue in her ventricle with enhanced sensitivity. Discussion(s): Newer-generation PET-MRI scans have ability to differentiate scar vs. inflammatory muscle with enhanced sensitivity. This improves clinical decision-making. Only 40-50% patients with cardiac sarcoidosis are diagnosed during their lifetime. To avert missed diagnoses, the advent of improved PET-MRI allows us to detect and treat cardiac sarcoidosis. It is incumbent to treat, because, if left untreated, the risk of sudden death from cardiac sarcoidosis is as high as 85%. Recent developments in PET technology reduce radiation dose. In our patient's situation, her decision to finally initiate therapy at age 54 was based on a patient-centered, empathic, compassionate explanation of the multi-system organ nature of her disease and the advantageous properties of PET-MRI to detect a treatable cause of dyspnea.",Excluded
4396,"Changes in neocortical function in response to the direct action of optical radiation The action of optical radiation on neocortical bioelectrical activity and on a penicillin-induced epileptic focus was investigated. The direct action of ultraviolet (UV) radiation with wavelengths 280, 310, and 365 nm was shown to increase the amplitude of the spontaneous EEG and to potentiate epileptiform activity, whereas the action of subthreshold radiation with wavelengths of 580 and 630 nm caused a reduction of EEG amplitude and inhibition of epileptiform activity. On the basis of the writers' own results and data in the literature it is postulated that the mechanism of action of UV radiation on neocortical electrical activity is based on changes in permeability of neuronal membranes to Na and K ions and subsequent membrane depolarization, whereas the action of visible radiation leads to thermal injury to the neurons in the irradiated zone, inducing irreversible suppression of their activity and a decrease in amplitude of the EEG.",Excluded
4615,"Analyzing the response to metabolic therapy in a mouse model of malignant glioma using multimodality imaging The ketogenic diet (KD) is a therapeutic high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that alters metabolism by increasing the level of ketone bodies in the blood. We have used a bioluminescent intracranial mouse model of malignant glioma and the IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, a PerkinElmer Co, Hopkinton, MA) to demonstrate that a rodent ketogenic diet given ad libitum increases blood ketones without altering animal weight or overall blood glucose levels. Animals maintained on a KD have extended survival following tumor implantation, and the KD potentiates the therapeutic effects of radiation and chemotherapy. We previously demonstrated in vivo that these tumors cause a local increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), but the KD reduced ROS in the tumor when quantitatively analyzed ex vivo. We now hypothesize that ketosis, which is known to have a neuroprotective effect in various diseases, may also reduce peritumoral edema and/or inflammation. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is a known mediator of inflammation, and expression profiling analysis showed that animals maintained on a SD have a significant increase in expression of the gene encoding COX-2 in their tumor, while animals maintained on KD showed no such increase. MRI analyses using a Bruker Biospec 70/30 MRI (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Freemont, CA) showed that animals fed KD also have a significant reduction in peritumoral edema. We previously demonstrated that commercially available fluorescent probes such as AngioSense 680 EX (PerkinElmer, Inc.) can be used in concert with in vivo imaging of tumor bioluminescence to demonstrate vascular permeability that can lead to increased peritumoral edema. We are now using the XenoLight RediJect COX-2 fluorescent probe (PerkinElmer, Inc) and the AngioSense 680 EX fluorescent probe in combination with the bioluminescent indication of tumor size and MRI analyses of tumor size and peritumoral edema.

4048,"BOLD fMRI integration into radiosurgery treatment planning of cerebral vascular malformations Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to distinguish areas of the brain responsible for different tasks and functions. It is possible, for example, by using fMRI images, to identify particular regions in the brain which can be considered as ""functional organs at risk"" (fOARs), i.e., regions which would cause significant patient morbidity if compromised. The aim of this study is to propose and validate a method to exploit functional information for the identification of fOARs in CyberKnife (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) radiosurgery treatment planning; in particular, given the high spatial accuracy offered by the CyberKnife system, local nonrigid registration is used to reach accurate image matching. Five patients affected by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and scheduled to undergo radiosurgery were scanned prior to treatment using computed tomography (CT), three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography (3DRA), T2 weighted and blood oxygenation level dependent echo planar imaging MRI. Tasks were chosen on the basis of lesion location by considering those areas which could be potentially close to treatment targets. Functional data were superimposed on 3DRA and CT used for treatment planning. The procedure for the localization of fMRI areas was validated by direct cortical stimulation on 38 AVM and tumor patients undergoing conventional surgery. Treatment plans studied with and without considering fOARs were significantly different, in particular with respect to both maximum dose and dose volume histograms; consideration of the fOARs allowed quality indices of treatment plans to remain almost constant or to improve in four out of five cases compared to plans with no consideration of fOARs. In conclusion, the presented method provides an accurate tool for the integration of functional information into AVM radiosurgery, which might help to minimize undesirable side effects and to make radiosurgery less invasive.

3910,"Dynamics of mouse rod phototransduction and its sensitivity to variation of key parameters The deep understanding of the biochemical and biophysical basis of visual transduction, makes it ideal for systems-level analysis. A sensitivity analysis is presented for a self-consistent set of parameters involved in mouse phototransduction. The organising framework is a spatio-temporal mathematical model, which includes the geometry of the rod outer segment (ROS), the layered array of the discs, the incisures, the biochemistry of the activation/deactivation cascade and the biophysics of the diffusion of the second messengers in the cytoplasm and the closing of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) gated cationic channels. These modules include essentially all the relevant geometrical, biochemical and biophysical parameters. The parameters are selected from within experimental ranges, to obey basic first principles such as conservation of mass and energy fluxes. By means of the model they are compared to a large set of experimental data, providing a strikingly close match. Following isomerisation of a single rhodopsin R * (single photon response), the sensitivity analysis was carried out on the photo-response, measured both in terms of number of effector molecules produced, and photocurrent suppression, at peak time and the activation and recovery phases of the cascade. The current suppression is found to be very sensitive to variations of the catalytic activities, Hill's coefficients and hydrolysis rates and the geometry of the ROS, including size and shape of the incisures. The activated effector phosphodiesterase (PDE *) is very sensitive to variations of catalytic activity of G-protein activation and the average lifetimes of activated rhodopsin R * and PDE *; however, they are insensitive to geometry and variations of the transduction parameters. Thus the system is separated into two functional modules, activation/deactivation and transduction, each confined in different geometrical domains, communicating through the hydrolysis of cGMP by PDE *, and each sensitive to variations of parameters only in its own module.",Excluded

Overall mean levels of breast and arm symptoms were low, but with large individual variations. At all six time points, the mean levels of breast symptoms were significantly higher than those of arm symptoms. Overall, the mean level of both types of symptoms decreased during follow-up.

We explored the combination of intermediate stereotactic dose radiation therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy as a novel treatment strategy for GBM.METHODS: Glioma xenograft-bearing mice were exposed to high dose brain-directed radiation (10 Gy single exposure) as well as mouse anti-PD-1 antibody. The tumor-bearing animals were randomized to four groups: no treatment, radiation alone, anti-PD-1 alone, and radiation + anti-PD-1. Survival was followed, and tumor growth was monitored using MRI. Immunohistochemistry, gene expression arrays, and flow cytometry were used to characterize the treatment-induced effects. Pharmacologic inhibitors of T-lymphocytes, bone marrow derived macrophages, and microglia were used to assess the respective roles of different immune populations in observed treatment effects.RESULTS: We found the combined treatment with high dose radiation and immunotherapy to be highly effective with a 75% complete pathologic response and dramatically improved survival outcomes. We found both CD8+ T-cells and macrophages to be necessary for the full effect of combined therapy, with T lymphocytes appearing to play a role early on and macrophages mediating a later phase of the combined treatment effect. Radiation treatment appeared to trigger macrophage repolarization, increasing M1/M2 ratio.CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to a novel immunologic mechanism underlying the interaction between radiotherapy and immunotherapy. They also provide the basis for clinical investigation of immunogenic dose radiation in combination with immune checkpoint blockade as a potential treatment approach for newly diagnosed high grade gliomas.",Excluded

4762,"Radiation-induced DNA damage in tumors and normal tissues. II. Influence of dose, residual DNA damage and physiological factors in oxygenated cells Detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors is important for many experimental and clinical situations. Several laboratories, including ours, have suggested that assays which measure radiation-induced DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) might be used to detect or quantify hypoxic cells in tumors and normal tissues. Recently, we demonstrated the feasibility of using an alkaline elution assay that measures strand breaks and DPCs to detect and/or quantify hypoxic cells in tissues. For this approach to be valid, DPCs must not be formed to any great extent in irradiated oxygenated cells, and the formation and repair of strand breaks and DPCs in oxygenated cells must not be modified appreciably by physiological factors (e.g. temperature, pH and nutrient depletion) that are often found in solid tumors. To address these issues, two sets of experiments were performed. In one set of experiments, oxygenated 9L cells in tissue culture, subcutaneous 9L tumors and rat cerebella were irradiated with doses of 15 or 50 Gy and allowed to repair until the residual strand break damage was low enough to detect DPCs. In another set of experiments, oxygenated exponentially growing or plateau-phase 9L cells in tissue culture were irradiated with a dose of 15 Gy at 37 or 20 degrees C, while the cells were maintained at a pH of either 6.6 or 7.3. DNA-protein crosslinks were formed in oxygenated cells about 100 times less efficiently than in hypoxic cells. In addition, temperature, pH, nutrient depletion and growth phase did not appreciably alter the formation and repair of strand breaks or the formation of DPCs in oxygenated 9L cells. These results support the use of this DNA damage assay for the detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors.",Included

4430,"The analgesic effect of low dose focal irradiation in a mouse model of bone cancer is associated with spinal changes in neuro-mediators of nociception Despite the widespread use of radiotherapy to treat painful bone metastases, the mechanism underlying the analgesic effect of low dose ionizing radiation is unknown. Bone cancer pain is mostly associated with an inflammatory response dominated by local activation of osteoclasts and by astrogliosis in the spinal cord. We determined the effects of a 6 Gy irradiation given focally on osteolytic sarcoma cells inoculated in humeri of mice. Pain behavior was assessed using the rota-rod and the grip force test. Seven days post-irradiation (day 17 post-tumor implantation) the performance of mice markedly improved on the rotarod (non-irradiated, 67+/-16s vs irradiated, 223 +/- 22 s; P = 0.0005), and the grip force test (non-irradiated, 34 +/- 4 g vs irradiated, 55 +/- 2 g; P = 0.001). This improvement was similar to the analgesia achieved with 30 mg/kg of the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ketorolac (Rota-rod, 67 +/- 16 s vs 178 +/- 35 s; P = 0.01: grip force test, 34 +/- 4 g, vs 60 +/- 5 g; P = 0.003). Following irradiation, the tumor mass and the number of osteoclasts did not decrease while the expression of two pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) increased. Tumor irradiation led to clear differences in the spinal cord. These include a decrease in glial activity (astrocytes and microglial cells) as well as pain mediators such as dynorphin, COX-2 and chemotactic cytokine receptor (CCR2). We conclude that the analgesic effect of low dose irradiation of bone cancer is associated with the alteration of nociceptive transmission in the central nervous system.",Excluded
4436,"Interstitial irradiation with stereotactically implanted I-125 seeds for the treatment of cerebral glioma Owing to its low rate of side effects and its high efficacy, interstitial irradiation with low-activity seeds should be the first therapeutic step in small (maximal diameter 40 mm), well-circumscribed, low-grade gliomas affecting the brain stem, other midline structures, or eloquent cerebral areas. In anaplastic gliomas, a therapeutic schedule using low-activity seeds and combining interstitial irradiation with radiotherapy (reduced boost dose of 15-30 Gy) seems to be more effective than interstitial irradiation alone. Compared with interstitial irradiation with high-activity seeds, this combined irradiation schedule caused no space-occupying radiation necrosis. Thus, it can be recommended as up-front treatment in patients with small (maximal diameter <40 mm) inoperable anaplastic gliomas. The use of high-activity I-125 seeds and interstitial irradiation at comparably high dose rates, integrating a small penumbra of normal brain tissue into the treatment volume, improved survival significantly in patients with primary highly malignant gliomas. In patients with recurrent tumors, the same treatment schedule did not substantially prolong survival compared with results obtained after resection plus radiotherapy. Owing to the high frequency of space-occupying radiation necrosis (40-60%), this schedule is only applicable in surgically accessible tumors. The application of low-activity I-125 seeds (in primary glioblastomas in combination with radiotherapy, in recurrent tumors without radiotherapy) yielded a median survival comparable with conventionally treated patients. There was no need for reoperation because of radiation necrosis. Thus, this treatment schedule is useful in both operable and surgically inaccessible glioblastomas.",Excluded

Other populations with similar reduced responses have shown improved immunogenicity to a high-dose vaccine. OBJECTIVE(S): A pilot prospective cohort study was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity of the Fluzone High-Dose influenza vaccine in patients with CNS malignancy. METHOD(S): Baseline data on diagnosis, chemotherapy, radiation, glucocorticoids, and timing of treatment were collected. All patients underwent vaccination with of the Fluzone High-Dose influenza vaccine. Serum samples are actively being collected at baseline, day 28, and 3 months following vaccine administration. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers will be measured to determine seroconversion (4-fold rise) and seroprotection (titer 1:40). RESULT(S): A total of 27 patients were enrolled. Mean age at baseline was 52.7 years (+/-12.6);41% male; 93% white and 7% black. Diagnoses included high-grade glioma (85%), CNS lymphoma (11%), and meningioma (4%).

4263,"Contrast or bleed? Using dual energy for differentiation in post-thrombectomy patients Neurological thrombectomy cases require a 24-h post-procedural unenhanced CT head scan to look for haemorrhagic transformation within the infarct. High attenuation signal can frequently be seen on unenhanced CT in these patients within the core infarct and is impossible to differentiate between iodine staining or haemorrhagic transformation. Evaluation of these images has always been subjective with no true diagnosis. Dual energy CT is an established imaging modality in differentiation of iodine and haemorrhage in high density lesions, post-clot retrieval or after contrast administration.1 Dual energy CT involves acquiring two simultaneous attenuation datasets at a high and low kV. The ratio of the difference in Hounsfield units in these two datasets gives us the ability to accurately differentiate different tissues. Utilising three material decomposition and iodine maps, virtual non-contrast images are created on the Syngo VIA workstation.2 A Siemens Dual Source CT scanner was utilised to accurately differentiate between iodine staining and/or haemorrhagic transformation in patients that underwent clot retrieval (see Figure). This is a robust method of differentiating between haemorrhage and/or iodine staining.1 The ability to accurately differentiate between iodine staining and haemorrhage in post-thrombectomy patients in a single scan has numerous benefits. The treating team can adapt anticoagulant therapy with confidence, nursing time spent doing regular observations is greatly reduced if no haemorrhage is identified, patients can be expedited to rehabilitation wards and radiation dose from repeat scans is eliminated.

4777,"Response characterstics of spinothalamic tract neurons that project to the posterior thalamus in rats A sizeable number of spinothalamic tract axons terminate in the posterior thalamus. The functional roles and precise areas of termination of these axons have been a subject of recent controversy. The goals of this study were to identify spinothalamic tract neurons (STT) within the cervical enlargement that project to this area, characterize their responses to mechanical and thermal stimulation of their receptive fields, and use microantidromic tracking methods to determine the nuclei in which their axons terminate. Forty-seven neurons were antidromically activated using low-amplitude (< or =30 microA) current pulses in the contralateral posterior thalamus. The 51 points at which antidromic activation thresholds were lowest were surrounded by ineffective tracks indicating that the surrounded axons terminated within the posterior thalamus. The areas of termination were located primarily in the posterior triangular, medial geniculate, posterior and posterior intralaminar, and suprageniculate nuclei. Recording points were located in the superficial and deep dorsal horn. The mean antidromic conduction velocity was 6.4 m/s, a conduction velocity slower than that of other projections to the thalamus or hypothalamus in rats. Cutaneous receptive fields appeared to be smaller than those of neurons projecting to other areas of the thalamus or to the hypothalamus. Each of the examined neurons responded exclusively or preferentially to noxious stimuli. These findings indicate that the STT carries nociceptive information to several target nuclei within the posterior thalamus. We discuss the evidence that this projection provides nociceptive information that plays an important role in fear conditioning.",Excluded

Little is known regarding prognostic features, clinical characteristics or the impact of treatment on patient (pt) outcomes. Method(s): In this IRB approved retrospective study, our neuro-oncology longitudinal database was screened for pts with GG from 1992-2012. 67 adult pts (age>18) were identified. Result(s): 60 pts presented with low grade GG and 7 with anaplastic GG. The median age at diagnosis was 27 years (18-59). 22 pts developed recurrent disease (18 low grade and 4 high grade) with a median time to recurrence of 87 weeks from surgery. 7 of the pts with low grade GG had malignant transformation to a malignant tumor (anaplastic GG or GBM). 22 pts received radiation therapy, 16 at diagnosis. 14 pts received chemotherapy at recurrence. Pts with incomplete resections or higher grade tumors were more likely to receive chemotherapy or radiation. The median overall survival (OS) time for these pts was not reached with a median follow-up time of 4.6 years. The 2-, 5- and 10-year OS were 98%, 87%, and 76%. Factors on univariate analysis that were significantly associated with OS were KPS at presentation (HR 10.1; 95% CI 2.6, 39.1; p = 0.0008), extent of resection (EOR) (biopsy vs gross total; HR 12.1; 95% CI 2.3, 63.6; p = 0.003), histologic grade (Grade 1-2 vs Grade 3-4; HR 0.06; 95% CI 0.01, 0.3; p = 0.0002), and seizure control following surgery (Engel I vs Engel 2-3; HR 0.1; 95% CI 0.01, 0.9; p = 0.02). Factors on univariate analysis that were significantly associated with progression free survival (PFS) were EOR (biopsy vs gross total; HR 4.0; 95% CI 1.4, 11.9; p = 0.01) and histologic grade (Grade 1-2 vs .Grade 3-4; HR 0.3; 95% CI 0.08, 0.8; p = 0.02).

DNA samples were isolated from whole 5-6-days adult males. The aliquots of DNA were digested by S1-nuclease. Preimaginal stage lethality increased with irradiation dose increasing. At the same time, decrease in imaginal LS (life span) was observed after irradiation with the greatest dose (4 Gy) only. Moreover, hormesis by LS has revealed: in males irradiation with 0.25, 0.75 and 1 Gy increased the mean LS, and with 0.25 and 0.5 Gy caused the maximum LS; in females exposures with 0.25, 0.75 and 2 Gy increased the maximum LS. The densitometric assay of DNA electrophoregrams showed decrease by 39.2% of the part of high-molecular-weight DNA in control as a result of S1-nuclease action. Samples of DNA from the irradiated flies were more stable to enzyme action. The higher stability of DNA originated from the irradiated flies could be the result of reparation system activation. Ultrastructural changes induced at the egg stage by irradiation at the dose of 0.75 Gy testify the increased transcriptional activity of the brain cells.",Included
3926,"Case of a patient with bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis presenting with photosensitive attacks State the Purpose: Photosensitive attacks are not generally known as TIA. We experienced a patient with photosensitive attacks induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Method(s): A 60-year-old man presented to our hospital because he experienced photosensitive attacks, which first occurred 3 months previously. In the case of our patient, sunlight always induced a photosensitive attack, during which he was blinded for approximately 10 minutes. He did not experience convulsions, loss of consciousness, headache, and symptoms of amaurosis. Ophthalmological examination, electroencephalography, and brain computed tomography (CT) did not indicate any abnormal findings. The patient was exposed to cervical radiation for pharyngeal cancer approximately 16 years previously. He did not have migraine, diabetes, and any previous cerebrovascular disease. The patient had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both of which were not treated appropriately. Result(s): One month after visiting our hospital, he experienced transient ischemic attacks (TIA) with right hemiparesis. Thereafter, the patient underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed small cerebral infarctions. Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed no abnormalities; however, ultrasound of the carotid artery showed stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA). Cerebral angiography also showed bilateral ICA stenosis (approximately 90%). A 99m-Technetium- ECD single-photon emission CT scan revealed low bilateral occipital perfusion. Because the bilateral ICA stenosis was induced by radiation, we decided to perform carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) instead of carotid endarterectomy. After CAS of the left carotid artery, the patient's photosensitivity completely disappeared. Conclusion(s): Photosensitive attacks are not generally known as TIA. In the present case, photosensitive attacks appear to have been induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.",Excluded

For the first time, we investigated the transcriptomes of covered (CB), sheltered (SB) and non-protected (NA) sea urchins Strongylocentrotus intermedius exposed to UV-B radiation. A total of 330 differentially expressed genes were revealed by transcriptome comparisons. By comparing with the group NA, we found 79 up-regulated and 118 down-regulated genes in SB group, as well as 26 up-regulated and 67 down-regulated genes in group CB. There were 34 up-regulated genes and 52 down-regulated genes in group SB, compared with group CB. These differentially expressed genes failed to enrich either Gene Ontology (GO) or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), only except an enrichment in KEGG. We highlighted TRPA1 and Opsin as key neurobiological genes involved in the molecular mechanisms of covering and sheltering behaviors of sea urchins exposed to UV-B radiation.

The cells have been stimulated in vitro with different number of pulses (75 - 1250), different intensities (10, 20 and 40%) and different frequencies (0.25, 1 and 10 Hz) by using a double coil (2x70 mm) connected to the 'Magstim rapid'. At selected time points after treatment the following endpoints have been determined: viability, cyclic AMP (cAMP) and heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72) (HL-60 cells), and viability, cAMP, dopamine and noradrenaline (PC12 cells). Viability was measured with the alamarBlue assay, whereas cAMP, Hsp72, dopamine and noradrenaline were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).RESULTS: In both cell lines viability was not influenced by rTMS treatment, the same was true for the cytosolic cAMP concentration. In HL-60 cells rTMS treatment did not change the Hsp72 content, also a protective effect of rTMS treatment on cell viability before toxic H(2)O(2) treatment was not observed. After high potassium treatment the release of the two neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline in PC12 cells was enhanced 15- and 5-fold, respectively, but after rTMS treatment no change in the release of the two neurotransmitters was observed.CONCLUSIONS: In two mammalian cell lines rTMS treatment in a variety of exposure conditions does not influence any of the measured parameters.",Excluded
3889,"A novel LITT treatment planning system to optimize laser ablation delivery to brain targets Purpose: Laser interstitial thermal therapy, or LITT, is a minimally invasive stereotactic tumor ablative technique. One application is treating intracranial targets. LITT systems use a laser energy probe that can be inserted into the patient, emitting near infrared laser radiation that induces necrosis in clinical targets while providing thermal damage updates via MR thermometry. The rigid laser probes range two and three mm in diameter, through which the thermal energy efficiently emits along straight-line pathways. The systems allow for varying dwell times and rates of energy deposition to assist in the ability to maximize the thermal damage to the target tissues while minimizing the damage to normal tissues. For targets that cannot be treated along a linear trajectory, multiple trajectories are necessary. However, planning systems, like those available in ionizing radiation delivery, are all but absent from the clinical setting. The goals of this project aim to provide a planning system to allow the optimization of the laser trajectory. Method(s): Twelve patients who underwent LITT therapy using traditional approaches, where the surgeon decided on laser trajectory by inspection of orthogonal radiology images were post procedure planned using a rudimentary system of LITT planning. Starting with a stereotactic planning system, a thermal dose kernel was developed. This effort has provided a rudimentary tool that yields first estimates for optimized LITT. Result(s): A conformal index was developed and evaluated for each planning technique. The average index for the simple inspection of orthogonal images based on thermal dose threshold lines was 88.4% while the conformal index of the planning system were 46.2%. Conclusion(s): As with ionizing radiation, it is anticipated that this increase in thermal optimization will translate into better tumor control and lower complications. A system, with a more precise thermal predictive algorithm and automated trajectory planning is being pursued.",Excluded

Here we demonstrate that a tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive persistent current also contributes to the graded depolarization. This current was isolated in amacrine cells of the goldfish retinal slice preparations by the whole-cell patch clamp technique. The activation threshold of the persistent current was about -50 mV, approximately 10 mV more positive than the membrane potential in the dark. Therefore, it is highly likely that the TTX-sensitive persistent current is a booster of the excitatory postsynaptic potential in amacrine cells.",Excluded

4594,"Effect of gonadotropin secretion rate on the radiosensitivity of the rat luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone neuron and gonadotroph To test the hypothesis that the functional state of hypothalamic LHRH neurons and pituitary gonadotrophs might alter their radiosensitivity, we determined the experimental conditions under which the gonadotropin response to castration could be impaired by a single dose of cranial irradiation. Single doses of cranial irradiation greater than 2000 rads were lethal to unshielded rats. Shielding of the oropharynx and esophagus allowed the animals to survive doses up to 5000 rads. Doses between 2000 and 5000 rads had no effect on basal gonadotropin levels for as long as 3 months after irradiation. Irradiation caused a dose- and time-dependent impairment, however, in the gonadotropin response to castration. Impairment of the gonadotropin levels of castrate animals occurred in animals that were irradiated either before or after castration. However, rats irradiated in the castrate state showed a decreased susceptibility to irradiation damage. Additionally, stimulation of the pituitary by LHRH agonist (LHRHa) 3 h before irradiation significantly reduced the impairment of gonadotropin secretion 12-20 weeks after irradiation (P less than 0.05). Thus, increased functional activity of the rat hypothalamus or pituitary at the time of irradiation, induced by either castration or acute LHRHa administration, was associated with some protection against the gonadotropin-lowering effect of irradiation. Based upon these data, we hypothesize that stimulation of gonadotropin secretion at the time of therapeutic cranial irradiation in humans might protect against subsequent impairment of gonadotropin secretion.",Included

3939,"Multisensory integration in the dorsal cochlear nucleus: unit responses to acoustic and trigeminal ganglion stimulation A necessary requirement for multisensory integration is the convergence of pathways from different senses. The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) receives auditory input directly via the VIIIth nerve and somatosensory input indirectly from the Vth nerve via granule cells. Multisensory integration may occur in DCN cells that receive both trigeminal and auditory nerve input, such as the fusiform cell. We investigated trigeminal system influences on guinea pig DCN cells by stimulating the trigeminal ganglion while recording spontaneous and sound-driven activity from DCN neurons. A bipolar stimulating electrode was placed into the trigeminal ganglion of anesthetized guinea pigs using stereotaxic co-ordinates. Electrical stimuli were applied as bipolar pulses (100 micros per phase) with amplitudes ranging from 10 to 100 microA. Responses from DCN units were obtained using a 16-channel, four-shank electrode. Current pulses were presented alone or preceding 100- or 200-ms broadband noise (BBN) bursts. Thirty percent of DCN units showed either excitatory, inhibitory or excitatory-inhibitory responses to trigeminal ganglion stimulation. When paired with BBN stimulation, trigeminal stimulation suppressed or facilitated the firing rate in response to BBN in 78% of units, reflecting multisensory integration. Pulses preceding the acoustic stimuli by as much as 95 ms were able to alter responses to BBN. Bimodal suppression may play a role in attenuating body-generated sounds, such as vocalization or respiration, whereas bimodal enhancement may serve to direct attention in low signal-to-noise environments.",Excluded

4467,"Hyperthermia promotes c-myc turnover and reduces ODC expression in colorectal cancer cells Hyperthermia therapy is an FDA-approved procedure that is used to improve the clinical response to radiation and chemotherapy in a variety of solid malignancies. This method involves raising the temperature of tumor-bearing tissues to 41-43degreeC, which is commonly achieved by using microwave or radiofrequency (RF)-emitting devices. Despite a multitude of treatment centers that are now providing this type of therapy, the cellular and molecular processes are not fully understood. Here, we report that that the oncogenic transcription factor, c-myc has a potentially important role in the anti-cancer mechanism of hyperthermia. By treating colorectal cancer cells (RKO cell line) with heat (incubation at 42degreeC), we observe a rapid decrease in c-myc levels that is not seen with other transcription factors. We have also observed a similar effect in other cell types, including lung (A549) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y). It is already known that the turnover of c-myc protein is enhanced by phosphorylation at Thr58. Our Western blot data reveal that hyperthermia causes a significant increase in Thr58 phosphorylation, which is accompanied by a reduction in total c-myc levels. c-Myc is frequently deregulated in human cancers, where it promotes the expression of genes that drive tumor cell proliferation. To assess the role of c-myc target genes in the response to hyperthermia, we looked at one such target gene, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis. We see that the hyperthermia-induced degradation of c-myc is accompanied by a drastic reduction in ODC mRNA and protein levels. Using actinomycin D, we observe that heat has no effect on ODC mRNA stability, suggesting that the decrease in ODC is due to a reduction in gene transcription. In support of this, we find that silencing c-myc expression with siRNA inhibits ODC mRNA and protein levels by a similar amount as hyperthermia. We propose that the down-regulation of ODC caused by c-myc degradation may be an important part of the clinical response to hyperthermia, and future work will evaluate the effect of heat on cellular polyamine levels.",Excluded

To understand extravasation kinetics and extravascular organ concentrations of AlbudAbs in humans, we studied tissue distribution and elimination of a non-conjugated <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeled AlbudAb in healthy volunteers using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Method(s): A non-conjugated AlbudAb (GSK3128349) was radiolabeled with <sup>89</sup>Zr and a single 1 mg (~ 15 MBq) dose intravenously administered to eight healthy males. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb tissue distribution was followed for up to 7 days with four whole-body PET/CT scans. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb tissue concentrations were quantified in organs of therapeutic significance, measuring standardized uptake value and tissue/plasma ratios. Plasma pharmacokinetics were assessed by gamma counting and LC-MS/MS of blood samples. Result(s): <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb administration and PET/CT procedures were well tolerated, with no drug-related immunogenicity or adverse events. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb rapidly distributed throughout the vasculature, with tissue/plasma ratios in the liver, lungs, and heart relatively stable over 7 days post-dose, ranging between 0.1 and 0.5. The brain tissue/plasma ratio of 0.025 suggested minimal AlbudAb blood-brain barrier penetration. Slowly increasing ratios in muscle, testis, pancreas, and spleen reflected either slow AlbudAb penetration and/or <sup>89</sup>Zr residualization in these organs. Across all tissues evaluated, the kidney tissue/plasma ratio was highest (0.5-1.5 range) with highest concentration in the renal cortex. The terminal half-life of the <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb was 18 days. Conclusion(s): Evaluating the biodistribution of <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb in healthy volunteers using a low radioactivity dose was successful (total subject exposure ~ 10 mSv).

4606,"Gamma knife radiosurgery after stereotactic aspiration for large cystic brain metastases Objective : Several treatment options have proven effective for metastatic brain tumors, including surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery. Tumors with cystic components, however, are difficult to treat using a single method. We retrospectively assessed the outcome and efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for cystic brain metastases after stereotactic aspiration of cystic components to decrease the tumor volume. Methods : The study population consisted of 24 patients (13 males, 11 females; mean age, 58.3 years) with cystic metastatic brain tumors treated from January 2002 to August 2008. Non-small cell lung cancer was the most common primary origin. After Leksell stereotactic frame was positioned on each patient, magnetic resonance images (MRI)-guided stereotactic cyst aspiration and GKRS were performed (mean prescription dose : 20.2 Gy). After treatment, patients were evaluated by MRI every 3 or 4 months. Results : After treatment, 13 patients (54.2%) demonstrated tumor control, 5 patients (20.8%) showed local tumor progression, and 6 patients (25.0%) showed remote progression. Mean follow-up duration was 13.1 months. During this period, 10 patients (41.7%) died, but only 1 patient (4.2%) died from brain metastases. The overall median survival after these procedures was 17.8 months. Conclusion : These results support the usefulness of GKRS after stereotactic cyst aspiration in patients with large cystic brain metastases. This method is especially effective for the patients whose general condition is very poor for general anesthesia and those with metastatic brain tumors located in eloquent areas.

Under certain conditions, the nuclear number doubling time (NNDT) was considered to represent the potential doubling time. Tumour specimens obtained at surgery were disaggregated into single-cell suspensions and were directly cultured in the presence of cytochalasin B with or without irradiation.

The DF ranged from 4.1% to 71% and the NNDT ranged from 3.1 to 83 days. A DF > or = 20% was associated with a higher recurrence rate in patients undergoing curative operation. A correlation was found between the NNDT and the time to relapse in patients with recurrent disease. The average number of micronuclei per binucleate cell at 2 Gy of irradiation (after subtraction of the value at 0 Gy) ranged from 0.052 to 0.35. Tumours which produced more micronuclei after irradiation showed a better response to radiotherapy. This assay can be readily performed on human tumours and appears to have promise as a predictive assay for radiation therapy.",Excluded
4643,"Lack of the alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 1 causes tremors, seizures, and early postnatal death in mice The Na(+)-independent alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 1 (Asc-1) is exclusively expressed in neuronal structures throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Asc-1 transports small neutral amino acids with high affinity especially for D-serine and glycine (K(i): 8-12 microM), two endogenous glutamate co-agonists that activate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors through interacting with the strychnine-insensitive glycine binding-site. By regulating D-serine (and possibly glycine) levels in the synaptic cleft, Asc-1 may play an important role in controlling neuronal excitability. We generated asc-1 gene knockout (asc-1(-/-)) mice to test this hypothesis. Behavioral phenotyping combined with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings revealed that asc-1(-/-) mice developed tremors, ataxia, and seizures that resulted in early postnatal death. Both tremors and seizures were reduced by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. Extracellular recordings from asc-1(-/-) brain slices indicated that the spontaneous seizure activity did not originate in the hippocampus, although, in this region, a relative increase in evoked synaptic responses was observed under nominal Mg(2+)-free conditions. Taken together with the known neurochemistry and neuronal distribution of the Asc-1 transporter, these results indicate that the mechanism underlying the behavioral hyperexcitability in mutant mice is likely due to overactivation of NMDA receptors, presumably resulting from elevated extracellular D-serine. Our study provides the first evidence to support the notion that Asc-1 transporter plays a critical role in regulating neuronal excitability, and indicate that the transporter is vital for normal CNS function and essential to postnatal survival of mice.",Excluded
4571,"Degree of light damage to the retina varies with time of day of bright light exposure After adaptation to cyclic illumination (14:10 light-dark cycle; intensity = 1.4 log ftc) male albino rats were exposed to brighter light (2.15 log ftc) seven hours daily for 25 days. The extent of retinal damage was determined histologically. Daily exposure to bright light in the morning produced greater photoreceptor loss than daily afternoon exposure. Severe retinal damage was partially prevented by brief light adaptation (20 minutes duration, at 1.4 log ftc intensity) before the onset of morning exposure. However, light adaptation did not remove the differential effect of time of day. The authors conclude that increased light exposure during the period of rod outer segment phagocytosis enhances photoreceptor damage.",Excluded

Data from 86 centers across the world were analyzed. All CT interactions were automatically collected and transmitted to the CT vendor during two 6-week periods immediately before and 2 weeks after implementation of ATVS. A total of 164 323 unique CT studies were analyzed. Studies were categorized by body region and type of examination. Tube voltage and volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) were compared between examinations performed with ATVS and those performed before ATVS implementation. Descriptive statistical methods and multilevel linear regression models were used for analysis.RESULTS: Across all types of CT examinations and body regions, CTDIvol was 14.7% lower in examinations performed with ATVS (n = 30 313) than in those performed before ATVS implementation (n = 79 275). Relative reductions in mean CTDIvol were most notable for temporal bone CT (-56.1%), peripheral runoff CT angiography (-48.6%), CT of the paranasal sinus (-39.6%), cerebral or carotid CT angiography (-36.4%), coronary CT angiography (-25.1%), and head CT (-23.9%). An increase in mean CTDIvol was observed for renal stone protocols (26.2%) and thoracic or lumbar spine examinations (6.6%). In the multilevel model with fixed effects ATVS and examination type, and the interaction of these variables and the random effect country, a significant influence on CTDIvol for all fixed efects was revealed (ATVS, P = .0031; examination type, P < .0001; interaction term, P < .0001).CONCLUSION: ATVS significantly reduces radiation dose across most, but not all, body regions and types of CT examinations.",Excluded

4821,"Ataxia-telangiectasia: a variant with altered in vitro phenotype of fibroblast cells The clinical and cellular phenotype of ataxia telangiectasia (AT) has been extensively documented in numerous patients of different ethnic groups and is characterized by several specific laboratory hallmarks, such as chromosomal instability, profound radiosensitivity and radioresistant DNA synthesis. Several recent reports have, however, shown variations on this theme. This article describes 2 Turkish siblings with AT, who showed a typical but somewhat more prolonged clinical course of the disease and altered characteristics of fibroblast cells, compared to the 'classical' AT cellular phenotype. Fibroblast strains derived from these patients showed a normal cellular life span, moderate degrees of chromosomal instability and sensitivity to the lethal effects of X-rays and neocarzinostatin, and lack of radioresistant DNA synthesis. A compilation of the literature on 'AT variants' and 'AT-like' syndromes shows that in addition to the internal variability of AT, this disease occupies a limited segment within a large spectrum of clinical and cellular features, which are common to a variety of syndromes. Each of these syndromes covers a different segment in this spectrum. The genetic basis of this family of disorders might be complex.",Excluded

4117,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases after prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited disease small-cell lung cancer Background: Brain metastases are very common in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has been shown to reduce the incidence of brain metastases and to improve overall survival in patients with limited-disease SCLC (LD-SCLC). However, brain metastases are often observed after PCI, and the optimal treatment for these brain metastases is still unclear. The present study investigated the recurrence of brain metastases after PCI in patients with LD-SCLC and the therapeutic efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery for these metastases. Method(s): Between December 2000 and December 2012, 228 patients with LD-SCLC were treated and 98 of these patients with a complete response (CR) or a near CR to chemoradiotherapy underwent PCI at the National Cancer Center Hospital. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and imaging data for these 98 patients. Result(s): Twenty-four (24%) of the 98 patients developed brain metastases after PCI. The characteristics of the 24 patients were as follows: median age, 62 years (49-72 years), male/female, 21/3; performance status 0/1/2, 2/16/6. Twelve (50%) of the 24 patients had cranial recurrences only. Twelve patients had single brain metastases, and 12 patients had multiple lesions. Nine patients had neurological symptoms due to brain metastases. The median period after PCI until the appearance of the metastases was 9.9 months (1.1-34.9 months). Fifteen (63%) of the 24 patients underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (gamma knife radiosurgery [GKRS]), and one patient received whole brain radiotherapy. Six patients were treated with chemotherapy plus best supportive care (BSC), and two patients underwent BSC alone. The 15 patients who received GKRS had brain metastases with/without extracranial lesions (7 with, 8 without); three were symptomatic, and 12 were asymptomatic. The median number of brain metastases at the time of the first GKRS was one (range, 1-4). The local control rate of the lesions treated with GKRS was 86.7% (complete response in 3 patients, partial response in 7 patients, and stable disease in 3 patients). Five patients underwent further GKRS because of newly developing brain metastases (median: 4 times, range: 2-7 times). The median intracranial control time of the 15 patients was 6.8 months. The median survival time of the 15 patients was 29.3 months after the initial diagnosis, 13.7 months after the development of brain metastases, and 12.7 months after the treatment of GKRS. The median survival time of the patients without extracranial lesions was 20.2 months after the development of brain metastases and tended to be longer than that of the patients with extracranial lesions (12.6 months). Severe adverse events arising from GKRS were not observed in this series. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery may be an effective option as a salvage therapy for brain metastases after PCI in patients with LD-SCLC.",Excluded

Efforts have, therefore, been focused on obtaining better results in the treatment of patients with high-risk tumors.

The advent of innovative anticancer drugs tested in brain tumors has important consequences for personalized therapy. Gene expression profiling of medulloblastoma can be used to identify the genes and signaling transduction pathways that are crucial for the tumorigenesis process, thereby revealing both new targets for therapy and sensitive/resistance phenotypes. The interpretation of microarray data for new treatments of patients with high-risk medulloblastoma, as well as other poor prognosis tumors, should be developed through a consensus multidisciplinary approach involving oncologists, neurosurgeons, radiotherapists, biotechnologists, bioinformaticists, and other professionals.

APBI was delivered using 3-dimensional CRT (n = 29) or with SAVI (n = 176), Contura (n = 56), or MammoSite (n = 20) brachytherapy catheters. Patients were evaluated at protocol-specified intervals, at which time the radiation oncologist scored cosmetic outcome, toxicities, and recurrence status using a standardized template.RESULTS: The median follow-up time is 41 months. Grade 1 seroma and fibrosis were more common with brachytherapy than with 3-dimensional CRT (50.4% vs 3.4% for seroma; P < .0001 and 66.3% vs 44.8% for fibrosis; P = .02), but grade 1 edema was more common with 3-dimensional CRT than with brachytherapy (17.2% vs 5.6%; P = .04). Grade 2 to 3 pain was more common with 3-dimensional CRT (17.2% vs 5.2%; P = .03). Actuarial 5-year rates of fair or poor radiation oncologist-reported cosmetic outcome were 9% for 3-dimensional CRT and 24% for brachytherapy (P = .13). Brachytherapy was significantly associated with inferior cosmesis on mixed model analysis (P = .003). Significant predictors of reduced risk of adverse cosmetic outcome after brachytherapy were D0.1cc (skin) <=102%, minimum skin distance >5.1 mm, dose homogeneity index >0.54, and volume of nonconformance <=0.89 cc. The 5-year ipsilateral breast recurrence was 4.3% for brachytherapy and 4.2% for 3-dimensional CRT APBI patients (P = .95).CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy APBI is associated with higher rates of grade 1 fibrosis and seroma than 3-dimensional CRT but lower rates of grade 1 edema and grade 2 to 3 pain than 3-dimensional CRT. Rates of radiation oncologist-reported fair or poor cosmetic outcomes are higher with brachytherapy. We identified dosimetric parameters that predict reduced risk of adverse cosmetic outcome after brachytherapy-based APBI.

4811,"Establishment and Characteristic Analysis of a Dog Model for Autologous Homologous Cranioplasty Objective. The aim of this study is to establish a large animal (dog) model that can be referred clinically for autologous homologous cranioplasty. Methods. Our large skull defect dog model was established by emulating the decompressive craniectomy with 22 adult beagle dogs. The autologous bones were taken out from the dogs and divided into two groups, the freeze-drying (FD) group and the single freezing (SF) group. They were then stored in the bone bank at-20degreeC after being irradiated with 25 KGy. Three months later, the bones were reimplanted. After operation, we closely watch the experimental objects for four more months examining the infection and survival of the bone graft. Results. Through macroscopic observation, it was found that, among 44 cranial flaps (bilateral) from the rest of the 22 dogs, grade A cranial flaps accounted for 86.4% (19/22) in the SF group and only 31.8% (7/22) in the FD group. Although osteogenic osteoclast, Harvard tube, neovascularization, and angiogenic factors were found through the pathological results, including an electron microscope and calmodulin tracer, it could be verified by using X-CT and micro-CT that early bone resorption could be still found even in grade A bone flap. Conclusion. By using the common clinical method to preserve the cranial flaps, we established an experimental dog model of autologous cranioplasty for a large area of cranial defect. It was proved that this model could reproduce the infections and bone resorption which typically happened in clinical autologous homologous cranioplasty. As a conclusion, the established model can be used as an effective experimental tool for further research to improve the success rate of autologous homologous cranioplasty.

3853,"The radiation exposure of the patient from stable-xenon computed tomography For stable-xenon computed tomography (CT), an X-ray examination for measurement of cerebral blood circulation in the brain, the radiation exposure of the patient was determined in order to estimate the risk of inducing cancer. Organ doses of brain, eyelenses, thyroid and gonads have been calculated using the measured air kerma free-in-air on the axis of rotation and organ-specific conversion factors calculated with the Monte Carlo method. Dose measurements with TLD-100 rods using a humanoid Alderson phantom were carried out for verification of the calculated organ doses. In the case of brain partially located in the region of primary radiation a mean organ dose of 39 mSv was calculated. The dose measurements showed dose equivalents between 6 and 68 mSv in different regions of the brain and consequently an inhomogeneous dose distribution. From an estimation of the radiation-induced risk using the effective dose of 1.6 mSv it follows that one additional fatal cancer per 12,500 stable-xenon CT examinations has to be expected. The organ doses of eyelenses and thyroid located in the region of scattered radiation are so low that biological effects are hardly to be expected. The calculated dose equivalents of 6.5 mSv and 0.5 mSv, respectively, are in good agreement with measurements. The organ dose of gonads amounted to less than 0.07 mSv.",Excluded

The primary aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of this new anesthetic protocol during HDR-ICRT for cervical cancer.METHODS AND MATERIALS: All the patients who were diagnosed with cervical cancer between December 2008 and February 2011, treated with three-channel brachytherapy and subjected to the new sedation protocol, were evaluated. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess the pain during brachytherapy, and we collected VAS score at the next HDR-ICRT. Toxicities were graded using the Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3.RESULTS: A total of 178 sessions of HDR-ICRT were delivered to 57 patients. The patients' median VAS pain score was 0 (range, 0-10). The most frequent side effect was Grade 1-2 nausea, which occurred in 33 sessions (34%). However, 13 of 14 patients received concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy.

3659,"Effects of escitalopram challenge on white matter integrity in obsessive-compulsive disorder and healthy controls Background: Involvement of the serotonergic system in OCD is well-known, with OCD responding to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Chronic use of SSRIs changes brain connectivity in OCD, and a single dose of an SSRI dramatically alters functional connectivity throughout the brain in healthy subjects. The question is raised whether acute administration of an SSRI can also significantly alter white matter integrity in the brain of patients with OCD. Method(s): OCD patients (n=20) and matched healthy controls (n=24) received a single dose of escitalopram 20mg on one day, and a single dose of placebo on another day, in randomized order, under double-blind conditions. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to compare white matter integrity of the whole brain between the groups. The impact of the SSRI challenge on white matter in these two study groups were subsequently investigated, controlling for age. Result(s): There were no significant interaction effects (diagnostic group x pharmacological challenge) or effects in the OCD group separately. In controls, the escitalopram challenge had a significant impact on white matter diffusivity of the left post thalamic radiation (PTR-L) (F=7.84; p=0.01), the superior corona radiata bilaterally (SCR: F=7.99; p=0.01) and the sagittal stratum bilaterally (SS: F=6.64; p=0.02). In these tracts, FA was significantly higher and RD significantly lower after the pharmacological challenge compared to placebo. Discussion(s): Acute administration of an SSRI did not significantly alter white matter integrity in the brain of OCD patients. It did however improve white matter integrity in tracts that connect regions that may be affected in OCD, in controls. DTI-derived parameters are differently affected in OCD and healthy controls, respectively, in structures within the fronto-striatothalamo-cortical loop after chronic SSRI treatment.

Unfortunately, there are limited treatment options to alleviate this distressing symptom. Preliminary data suggest that the combination of exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and methylphenidate (that is, multimodality therapy [MMT]) can play an important role in reducing CRF. The project's objective is to explore the effects and safety of this MMT on CRF in prostate cancer patients scheduled to receive radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy. We hypothesizethat the MMT is capable of reducing CRF as measured by the FACIT-F subscale in prostate cancer patients scheduled to receive radiotherapy. Specific Aims:(1) Our primary aim is to obtain preliminary estimates of the effects of various treatments (exercise, CBT, and methylphenidate) and their combinations in reducing CRF in prostate cancer patients receiving radiotherapy, as measured by the change in patients' FACIT-F subscale scores taken at baseline and on day 57 and the secondary objective is to determine the effects of the treatments and their combinations on anxiety and depressed mood (both measured by the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale [HADS]); on physical activity and function (measured by an accelerometer and a handgrip dynamometer, respectively); on levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10) in serum and induced monocytes, before and after treatment Methods: For this study, we will use a randomized factorial design to assess 3 treatments (exercise, CBT, and methylphenidate) and their placebos in 8 replications.

4513,"Short-term synaptic depression and recovery at the mature mammalian endbulb of Held synapse in mice The endbulb of Held synapses between the auditory nerve fibers (ANF) and cochlear nucleus bushy neurons convey fine temporal information embedded in the incoming acoustic signal. The dynamics of synaptic depression and recovery is a key in regulating synaptic transmission at the endbulb synapse. We studied short-term synaptic depression and recovery in mature (P22-38) CBA mice with stimulation rates that were comparable to sound-driven activities recorded in vivo. Synaptic depression in mature mice is less severe ( approximately 40% at 100 Hz) than reported for immature animals and the depression is predominately due to depletion of releasable vesicles. Recovery from depression depends on the rate of activity and accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ at the presynaptic terminal. With a regular stimulus train at 100 Hz in 2 mM external [Ca2+], the recovery from depletion was slow (tauslow, approximately 2 s). In contrast, a fast (taufast, approximately 25 ms), Ca2+-dependent recovery followed by a slower recovery (tauslow, approximately 2 s) was seen when stimulus rates or external [Ca2+] increased. In normal [Ca2+], recovery from a 100-Hz Poisson-like train is rapid, suggesting that Poisson-like trains produce a higher internal [Ca2+] than regular trains. Moreover, the fast recovery was slowed by approximately twofold in the presence of calmidazolium, a Ca2+/calmodulin inhibitor. Our results suggest that endbulb synapses from high spontaneous firing rate auditory nerve fibers normally operate in a depressed state. The accelerated synaptic recovery during high rates of activity is likely to ensure that reliable synaptic transmission can be achieved at the endbulb synapse.",Excluded

MYCN overexpression is strongly associated with advanced disease stage, rapid tumor progression and a worse prognosis. In the present study, we identified microRNA-375 (miR-375) as a negative regulator of MYCN: enforced expression of miR-375 inhibited MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo. Upon searching the website miRbase for possible miR-375 binding sites within the whole MYCN mRNA, we found that the MYCN 5'-UTR had significant sequence complementarity to miR-375, yet no complementary sequences existed within the MYCN 3'-UTR and coding regions. Enforced overexpression of miR-375 efficiently inhibited MYCN mRNA translation and protein synthesis, via an IRES-dependent mechanism. In athymic nude mouse model with human MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, MYCN downregulation by miR-375 led to inhibition of tumor cell growth and tumorigenicity. In particular, miR-375-regulated inhibition of MYCN translation was enhanced when MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells were exposed to stress stimulation, such as ionizing irradiation (IR), resulting in a remarkable increase in the neuroblastoma's sensitivity to IR-induced cell death. Our results identified a novel mechanism by which IRES-dependent translation of MYCN is repressed by miR-375, particularly during cellular stress, highlighting a potential anticancer strategy: the development of miR-375 as a novel therapeutic agent to treat MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.",Excluded
4074,"Reduced somatosensory hand representation in thalidomide-induced dysmelia as revealed by fMRI The concept of cerebral plasticity suggests that the hand representation in somatosensory cortex is abnormal in congenital malformation disorders. To investigate this issue we studied 11 subjects with different degrees of upper extremity dysmelia due to thalidomide embryopathy in comparison to 10 control subjects. In the affected subjects fingers are typically missing in radio-ulnar order beginning with the thumb. Haemodynamic responses to electrical stimulation of the radial-most and ulnar-most fingers were measured in each subject using functional magnetic resonance tomography. The size of the hand area in the primary somatosensory cortex was estimated by calculating the Euclidian distance between corresponding activation peaks on the lateral postcentral gyrus. The cortical somatosensory hand representation was found to be significantly smaller in dysmelic subjects as compared with the control subjects (P <0.001). The shrinkage of the hand area was not proportional to the number of missing fingers. Furthermore, the cortical representation of the ulnar fingers in the dysmelic subjects was shifted towards the cortical thumb representation of the control group. We suggest that the unproportional reduction of the hand area together with the observed shift may reflect use-dependent rather than malformation-induced reorganization of the somatosensory hand area.",Excluded

For this purpose a volume-of-interest (VOI) for each entity has to be defined in image data, acquired at days 1, 2 and 3 p.i. We have studied a method to automatically segment tumour and kidney VOIs in 4D SPECT data compared to manually defined VOIs. Material(s) and Method(s): Three patients (mean 70.7y) with neuroendocrine tumours who received 7.4GBq of Lu-177 DOTATATE were imaged with a Dual-head SPECT/CT (Siemens Symbia T2) with 20s/step in 64 steps/head. The CT image taken at day 1 was coregistered to each SPECT dataset and utilized for attenuation correction in penalized OSEM reconstruction employing compensation for distance dependent detector blur and photon scatter. The three SPECT volumes were synthesized to form a 4D SPECT study. A robust k-means cluster algorithm was used to automatically detect eight clusters in these dynamic image data, followed by a labeller to segment each individual connected VOI. For comparison, three to five tumours and two kidney VOIs were manually defined for each patient and an auto contour at the 40% of maximum value was applied. Based on the mean time-activity curves of each selected VOI a 3D dose map was calculated using S-value convolution kernels (Monte Carlo simulation in soft tissue). Result(s): The automatic segmentation successfully found 11 out of 12 tumour VOIs and three out of six kidney cortex VOIs. The missed entities can be addressed to overlapping with surrounding high-activity VOIs, mainly tumours and spleen. The mean dose values of the 11 tumours were 17.2+/-9.1Gy with the automatic and 16.5+/-9.1Gy with the manual method. The estimated dose to the cortex of the three successfully segmented kidneys was 9.7+/-1.7Gy with the automatic and 8.7+/-1.1Gy with the manual method. We found a strong correlation (rho=0.8) and no significant difference (paired t-test) between the dose estimates of both methods. Conclusion(s): The automatic segmentation is a promising approach to reduce the effort to generate dose estimates in PRRT. Nevertheless we observed that the position of kidneys can significantly change between measurement days, hindering an accurate coregistration on the voxel or organ boundary level. These misregistered boundaries can result in false segmentation and dosimetric results. Furthermore the inclusion of structural information such as the CT image into the automatic segmentation algorithm could be a promising improvement.",Excluded

This study was performed to find out the effect of mobile phone frequency on male Wistar rats. Animals were divided into two groups (n=6 in each group). Group one was considered as control and group two (experimental group) was exposed to microwave radiation (2100MHz) for 4 hours/day (5 days/week) for 3 months. Exposure of microwave radiation frequency showed significant alterations in cholinesterase activity, muscular strength, learning ability and anxiety. MWR exposure was also associated with significant alteration in the oxidative defense system and hippocampus degeneration. Histopathological observations clearly depicted the neural degeneration. Thus, it can be concluded that MWR significantly affects the central nervous system and may lead to many severe illnesses. This study may reveal a platform to understand its toxic effect and can further be used for amendment in current guidelines of mobile radiation.",Excluded
4611,"Delayed sequelae of pituitary irradiation Since 1958, 781 patients at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory have received helium-particle stereotactic radiosurgery to the adenohypophysis. Autopsy findings in 15 of these patients are reported. Ten patients received pituitary radiation (average dose, 116 Gy in six fractions) for progressive neovascularization retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus. Evidence of a time-dependent course of progressive fibrosis in their pituitary glands was found. Five patients were treated for eosinophilic adenomas. Although they had lower average doses of radiation (56 Gy in six fractions), their pituitary glands showed cystic cavitation of the adenomas. The adenomas thus appeared more radiosensitive than the normal pars anterior, which, in turn, was more radiosensitive than the adjacent neurohypophysis. No significant radiation changes were found in the surrounding brain or cranial nerves. The endocrine organs under pituitary control showed varying degrees of atrophy, and clinical tests revealed progressive hypofunction. It was concluded that charged-particle therapy produced a sharply delineated focal radiation lesion confined to the pituitary gland but did not cause injury to the critical structures of the surrounding central nervous system.",Excluded
3855,"Functional significance of XPD polymorphic variants: attenuated apoptosis in human lymphoblastoid cells with the XPD 312 Asp/Asp genotype Recent molecular epidemiological studies have identified polymorphisms in the XPD gene that are associated with increased risk of brain gliomas and head, neck, lung, and skin cancers. However, the functional significance of these polymorphic variants in altering cell processes such as cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, and apoptosis is uncertain. We have cloned the XPD variants Lys751Gln, Asp312Asn, and Lys751Gln-Asp312Asn into a pcDNA-3.1-expression vector. Using these constructs, we did not find any detectable difference in either in vitro binding with wild-type p53 or in DNA repair proficiency as measured by host cell reactivation assay. We then genotyped 34 different lymphoblastoid cell lines from six Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humaine (CEPH)/Utah pedigree families and a CEPH/French pedigree family for polymorphisms at codons 751 and 312 and assessed their apoptotic response after either UV or ionized radiation exposure. The lymphoblastoid cell lines with homozygous or heterozygous Asp at codon 312 have similar apoptotic rates, whereas cell lines with homozygous Asn at codon 312 showed a 2.5-fold increased response to UV (P = 0.005; Student's t test). This is the first report known to us of a functional polymorphism in a gene involved in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. However, the presence of Lys or Gln at codon 751 did not influence the apoptotic response to UV. The diminished apoptotic response of cells containing the 312 Asp allele could both allow the survival and selective clonal expansion of carcinogen-damaged cells and be a mechanistic explanation for the increased risk of cancer at diverse tissue sites.",Excluded

The other 45 patients were all treated by irradiation. 40(89%) patients had bronchogenic carcinoma, three had primaries in other parts of the body and two had unknown primaries. In 16 patients, whole brain was irradiated to a dose of 1000-4000 cGy. Their 6 month survival rate was 25% but all died within one year. In 24 patients, whole brain was first irradiated to 3000-4000 cGy. Then the dose was increased to 5000-6000 cGy by cone down technique. Their 6 month survival was 75%, 1 year survival 33%. The high-dose-cone down method is obviously more effective. In the other 5 patients who were retreated locally for recurrence or new foci in the other parts of the brain, their survival was 4 to 8 months taken from the start of the second course of radiotherapy. One of these five patients is still living as of this writing. Extensive brain necrosis was observed in three patients who received whole brain radiation in the second course. Yet untoward reactions were noted in the two patients who received local irradiation in the second course. This may imply that, for the second course, only local radiation is indicated.",Included
4692,"Serum exosome proteomic profiling reveals molecular fingerprints of tissue injury caused by cancer chemotherapy Exosomes are nanovesicles released from most cell types especially under cellular stress conditions including oxidative stress. It is well-recognized that in addition to ionizing radiation, nearly 50% of FDA- approved chemotherapeutics cause oxidative stress in target tissues. However, the tissue origin and contents of exosomes released from chemotherapy-treated cells and their contribution to tissue injury are unknown. Here we report that in human serum, exosomes isolated from cancer patients (n = 24) exhibit a significantly higher level of 4-hydroxynonenal adducted proteins post-chemotherapy (P<0.02). In mice, systemic injection of chemotherapeutic drugs exemplified by Doxorubicin (DOX) caused a two-fold increase in circulating exosomes (DOX-EXO) compared to saline-treated controls (SAL-EXO). The authenticity of exosomes in the serum was characterized by electron microscopy and by identification of exosome markers, including Alix, CD 63, and TSG 101. Dynamic light scattering analysis showed that DOX-EXO has broader size distribution shifting to the larger size (25-200 nm) compared to SAL-EXO (10-120 nm). Proteomic analysis of mouse serum exosomes identified 329 and 275 proteins in SAL-EXO and DOX-EXO, respectively. Interestingly, proteins found in DOX-EXO serum, include glycogen phosphorylase brain, liver and muscle forms, implicate brain, liver and muscle as the source of exosomes in Dox treated animals. Proteins distinctly expressed in DOX-EXO serum also include proteins involved in DNA repair (XRCC3 and ERCC6), autophagy (TM9S1), and metabolic process (pyruvate kinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase). Thus, circulating exosomes are sensitive markers for tissues targeted by redox active chemotherapy and serve as cargo-carrying vehicles for the metabolic and repair proteins necessary for defense against chemotherapy-induced tissue injury.",Excluded
3923,"Boron neutron capture therapy combined with early successive bevacizumab treatments for recurrent malignant gliomas - A pilot study Recurrent malignant gliomas (RMGs) are difficult to control, and no standard protocol has been established for their treatment. At our institute, we have often treated RMGs by tumor-selective particle radiation called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). However, despite the cell-selectivity of BNCT, brain radiation necrosis (BRN) may develop and cause severe neurological complications and sometimes death. This is partly due to the full-dose X-ray treatments usually given earlier in the treatment course. To overcome BRN following BNCT, recent studies have used bevacizumab (BV). We herein used extended BV treatment beginning just after BNCT to confer protection against or ameliorate BRN, and evaluated; the feasibility, efficacy, and BRN control of this combination treatment. Seven patients with RMGs (grade 3 and 4 cases) were treated with BNCT between June 2013 and May 2014, followed by successive BV treatments. They were followed-up to December 2017. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after combination treatment were 15.1 and 5.4 months, respectively. In one case, uncontrollable brain edema occurred and ultimately led to death after BV was interrupted due to meningitis. In two other cases, symptomatic aggravation of BRN occurred after interruption of BV treatment. No BRN was observed during the observation period in the other cases. Common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 2 and 3 proteinuria occurred in two cases and necessitated the interruption of BV treatments.

The aim of this study is to determine if the deferral of brain radiotherapy impacts patient outcomes.METHODS: Between May 2003 and December 2015, a total of 198 patients with brain metastases from NSCLC who received both brain radiotherapy and systemic therapy (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) were identified. The rate of grade 3-4 adverse reactions related to chemotherapy and radiotherapy had no significant difference between two groups. 127 patients received concurrent brain radiotherapy and systemic therapy, and 71 patients received deferred brain radiotherapy after at least two cycles of chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Disease specific-graded prognostic assessment was similar in early radiotherapy group and deferred radiotherapy group.RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) was longer in early radiotherapy group compared to deferred radiotherapy group (17.9 months vs 12.6 months; P=0.038). Progression free survival (PFS) was also improved in patients receiving early radiotherapy compared to those receiving deferred radiotherapy (4.0 months vs 3.0 months; P<0.01). Receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy after the diagnosis of brain metastases as any line therapy improved the OS (20.0 months vs 10.7 months; P<0.01), whereas receiving TKI as first line therapy did not (17.9 months vs 15.2 months; P=0.289).CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the use of deferred brain radiotherapy may resulted in inferior OS in patients with NSCLC who develop brain metastases.

4249,"Failla Memorial lecture. The future of heavy-ion science in biology and medicine Interplanetary space contains fluxes of fast moving atomic nuclei. The distribution of these reflects the atomic composition of the universe, and such particles may pose limitations for space flight and for life in space. Over the past 50 years, since the invention of Ernest Lawrence's cyclotron, advances in accelerator technology have permitted the acceleration of charged nuclei to very high velocities. Currently, beams of any stable isotope species up to uranium are available at kinetic energies of several hundred MeV/nucleon at the Berkeley Bevalac. Recently, new areas of particle physics research relating to the mechanisms of spallation and fission have opened up for investigation, and it is now realistic to search for nuclear super-dense states that might be produced in heavy nuclear collisions. The heavy ions hold interest for a broad spectrum of research because of their effectiveness in producing a series of major lesions in DNA along single particle tracks and because of the Bragg depth ionization properties that allow the precise deposition of highly localized doses deep in the human body. Individual heavy ions can also interrupt the continuity of membraneous regions in cells. Heavy ions, when compared to low-LET radiation, have increased effectiveness for mammalian cell lethality, chromosome mutations, and cell transformation. The molecular mechanisms are not completely understood but appear to involve fragmentation and reintegration of DNA. Cells attempt to repair these lesions, and many of the deleterious effects are due to misrepair or misrejoining of DNA. Heavy ions do not require the presence of oxygen for producing their effects, and hypoxic cells in necrotic regions have nearly the same sensitivity as cells in well-oxygenated tissues. Heavy ions are effective in delaying or blocking the cell division process. Heavy ions are also strong enhancers of viral-induced cell transformation, a process that requires integration of foreign DNA. Some cell lines, known to be radioresistant to X rays, have exhibited greater sensitivity to heavy ions. These radiobiological properties, combined with the ability to deliver highly localized internal doses, make accelerated heavy ions potentially important radiotherapeutic tools. Other novel approaches include the utilization of radioactive heavy beams as instant tracers. Heavy-ion radiography and microscopy respond to delicate changes in tissue electron density. Dose localization with helium ions has achieved excellent results for pituitary tumors, tumors adjacent to the spinal cord, and ocular melanomas. We are working on adapting silicon- and neon-ion beams for controlled therapy studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) [References: 119]",Excluded

At our centre, the number of treatments is based on the absorbed dose (AD) to the kidneys. For logistical reasons, estimation of absorbed doses should be performed with as few measurements as possible. The aim of the present work was to study how well kidney AD and effective half-life (t<inf>eff</inf>) estimations using methods with one or two measurement points agree with the method we use today that is based on three imaging points. Material(s) and Method(s): 777 patients (333 female and 444 male) with neuroendocrine tumors with high somatostatin receptor expression were included. SPECT/CT over the abdomen were acquired at 24, 96 and 168 h after start of infusion of<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE. AD and teff were calculated using single exponential fits to data from 3 measurements (24-96-168) or two measurements (24- 96 and 24-168). In addition, absorbed doses were calculated using a single measurement, assuming t<inf>eff</inf>50 h (96/50h). Bias of AD and teff values relative to those based on the three-point measurement were calculated. To test statistical significance a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test with a P-value of 0.05 for significance was used. Median, Min and Max of the deviations were also calculated. Result(s): Bias versus AD(24-96- 168) was -3%(-20-72) (Median (Min-Max)) for AD(24-96), 3%(-22- 30) for AD(24-168) and -7%(-51-27) for AD(96/50h). The bias for teff in the AD calculations versus AD(24-96-168) was -9% (-53- 63) for AD(24-96) and 0% (-9-4) for AD(24-168). In all tests there was a small but significant difference for the whole group. In about 15% of the patients the bias in t<inf>eff</inf>was more than 20% when ignoring the 168-h scan. In about 5-10% of the patients AD differed more than 20% for all methods that excluded the 168-h measurement. Using a fixed limit of the absorbed dose to the kidneys, this would mean that these patients would be given either too many or too few treatments. Conclusion(s): Although absorbed dose calculations based on only one or two measurement points may serve as a good approximation for the majority of patients, it leads to substantial errors affecting the number of given treatments in about 10% of patients. Since this is a radiation treatment a high precision for all patients is warranted, and three measurements, or at least inclusion of a late 168-h measurement, are recommended.",Excluded
4321,"Preconditioning-induced protection of photoreceptors requires activation of the signal-transducing receptor gp130 in photoreceptors Retinal degenerations are a class of neurodegenerative disorders that ultimately lead to blindness due to the death of retinal photoreceptors. In most cases, death is the result of long-term exposure to environmental, inflammatory, and genetic insults. In age-related macular degeneration, significant vision loss may take up to 70-80 years to develop. The protracted time to develop blindness suggests that retinal neurons have an endogenous mechanism for protection from chronic injury. Previous studies have shown that endogenous protective mechanisms can be induced by preconditioning animals with sublethal bright cyclic light. Such preconditioning can protect photoreceptors from a subsequent damaging insult and is thought to be accomplished through induced expression of protective factors. Some of the factors shown to be associated with protection bind and activate the signal transducing receptor gp130. To determine whether stress-induced endogenous protection of photoreceptors requires gp130, we generated conditional gp130 knockout (KO) mice with the Cre/lox system and used light-preconditioning to induce neuroprotection in these mice. Functional and morphological analyses demonstrated that the retina-specific gp130 KO impaired preconditioning-induced endogenous protection. Photoreceptor-specific gp130 KO mice had reduced protection, although the Muller cell KO mice did not, thus gp130-induced protection was restricted to photoreceptors. Using an animal model of retinitis pigmentosa, we found that the photoreceptor-specific gp130 KO increased sensitivity to genetically induced photoreceptor cell death, demonstrating that gp130 activation in photoreceptors had a general protective role independent of whether stress was caused by light or genetic mutations.",Excluded

A median dose was 60 Gy. Concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy were administered to 111 patients. MIB-1 LI was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Recurrence patterns were categorized according to the areas of recurrence as follows: central failure (recurrence in the 95% of 60 Gy); in-field (recurrence in the high-dose volume of 50 Gy; marginal (recurrence outside the high-dose volume) and distant (recurrence outside the RT field). Result(s): The median follow-up durations were 13 months for all patients and 19 months for those remaining alive. Among AA patients, the 2-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 23.1% and 39.2%, respectively, while in GB patients, the rates were 13.3% and 27.6%, respectively. The median survival time was 20 months for AA patients and 15 months for GB patients. Among AA patients, recurrences were central in 68.7% of patients; in-field, 18.8%; and distant, 12.5%, while among GB patients, 69.0% of recurrences were central, 15.5% were in-field, 12.1% were marginal, and 3.4% were distant. The MIB-1 LI medians were 18.2% in AA and 29.8% in GB.

The distribution of the induced electric field was computed, and estimates of the relevant parameters were generated to predict the locus and type of neurons stimulated during TMS, assuming three different stimulation mechanisms.RESULTS: Tissue heterogeneity strongly affects the spatial distribution of the induced electric field and hence which stimulation mechanism is dominant and where it acts. Stimulation of neurons may occur in the gyrus, in the lip of the gyrus, and in the walls of the sulcus. The stimulated cells can be either pyramidal cells having medium to large caliber axons, or intracortical fibers of medium caliber.CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the influence of cortical folding on the action of magnetic and electric fields on cortical tissue.SIGNIFICANCE: Tissue geometry and heterogeneity in electrical conductivity both must be taken into account to predict accurately stimulation loci and mechanism in TMS.",Excluded

This study was conducted to explore the impact of dose boost in skull base on the recurrence in skull base and survival of NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement. METHOD(S): A total of 120 stage T4 NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement proved by histopathology and computed tomography (CT) were treated in our hospital from Oct. 1996 to Nov. 1998. The irradiation dose was (71.55+/-3.09) Gy in nasopharynx and (58.95+/-6.16) Gy in neck. Of the 120 patients, 27 received irradiation (6-10 Gy) in skull base after radiotherapy (boost group), 93 did not receive irradiation in skull base (control group). Fifty-three patients, 41 in control group and 12 in boost group, received cisplatin-based chemotherapy for 1-3 cycles. The survival rates and the recurrence of the 2 groups were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. RESULT(S): The clinical characteristics of patients were similar in the 2 groups. The 1-, 3-, 5-year skull base control rates were significantly higher in boost group than in control group (100% vs. 93.4%, 91.8% vs. 76.4%, and 86.8% vs. 65.1%, respectively, P=0.045). The 1-, 3-, 5-year disease-freely survival rates were slightly higher in boost group than in control group (85.2% vs. 75.3%, 59.3% vs. 45.2%, and 51.9% vs. 31.2%, respectively, P=0.084).

4683,"Effects of background illumination on the horizontal cell responses in the tiger salamander retina Synaptic transmission between photoreceptors and horizontal cells (HCs) was studied in the flat-mounted isolated retinas of the tiger salamander. Background illumination expedited the rise time of the HC light response, and the HC response rise time (HCRRT) reached steady state about 2 sec after the onset of the background illumination. The change in HCRRT is probably responsible for the background-induced enhancement of the HC responses to short light stimuli. The amplitude of the HC responses to 100 msec light steps in the presence of background illumination was 2-5 times larger than that measured under dark-adapted conditions. Background illumination exerted little effect on the response rise time in cones and bipolar cells, and thus it caused no significant response enhancement in those cells. The background-induced change in HCRRT correlated closely with the rod voltage but not with the HC voltage. These results suggest that the background-induced change in HCRRT is probably mediated by postsynaptic events in HCs because no significant time course change is observed in photoreceptors and bipolar cells (which share the same synapses with the HCs). A suppressive rod action on the cone inputs in HCs may be responsible for modulating the HCRRT. By shortening the HCRRT, background illumination regulates the frequency response of the photoreceptor-HC synapse and alters the capacity of spatial resolution of retinal bipolar cells.",Excluded

It was found that combination of ionizing radiation and heat led to hypofunction of the endocrine glands and inhibition of dehydration processes in the Krebs Cycle.",Included
4150,"Genetic and physiological regulation of non-homologous end-joining in mammalian cells Repair of DSBs is important to prevent chromosomal fragmentation, translocations and deletions. To investigate the process in NHEJ, we have established an in vitro system to clarify the measurement and analysis of the efficiency and the fidelity of rejoining of DSBs, and applied the method to investigate NHEJ in human cells derived from patients suffering from cancer-prone hereditary diseases. A DSB was introduced in plasmid pZErO-2 at a specific site within the ccdB gene that is lethal to E. coli cells, and treated with nuclear extracts from human cells. The efficiency of rejoining in the nuclear extract from an A-T cell line was comparable to that from a control cell line. However, the accuracy of rejoining was much lower for the A-T cell extract than for the control cell extract. All mutations were deletions, most of which contained short direct repeats at the breakpoint junctions. The deletion spectrum caused by the A-T nuclear extract was distinct from that by the control extract. These results indicate that A-T cells have certain deficiencies in end-joining of double-strand breaks in DNA. The extract from BS cells also showed the similar activity and the lower fidelity of rejoing compared to that from normal cells. From the sequencing analysis of the junction of DSBs, it is speculated that the defect in the BLM helicase might cause irregular rejoining of DSBs. Radioadaptive response is the acquirement of cellular resistance to ionizing radiation by prior exposure to low dose. We investigated the in vitro end-joining activity of DNA ends in radioadaptive cells. Both the efficiency and the fidelity of rejoining in the cells pre-exposed to low dose are increased comparing to those without pre-exposure. We also investigated the joining activity of DNA ends in p53-deficient cells. Pre-irradiation caused no apparent alteration in both the efficiency and fidelity of end-joining. These results suggest that the exposure to low dose activates a cellular function to repair DSBs efficiently, which is dependent on p53. These results indicate that NHEJ pathway is regulated by many factors; genetic regulation by ATM and BLM, and physiological conditions such as irradiation with ionizing radiation. The observations also suggest that in some occasions p53 might play a key role in NHEJ. [References: 103]",Excluded
4796,"Multiple primary malignancies of the thyroid gland and the brain: A case report A majority of studies have reported cases on patients with primary thyroid cancer who developed subsequent malignancies, following their initial thyroid cancer diagnosis. Notably glioma has been reported as a secondary cancer following thyroid cancer diagnosis. A case of a 50-year-old woman with a history of thyroid nodules and symptom of throat discomfort is reported in the present study. A fine needle aspiration of the thyroid nodules confirmed the presence of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The patient received a total thyroidectomy followed by iodine 131 (<sup>131</sup>I) treatment. The patient was admitted to the hospital following 5 years of the initial treatment, due to headache and nausea. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head region revealed an irregular lesion at the left temporal lobe. Following frontal tumor resection, the biopsy revealed brain astrocytoma. Postoperatively, the patient underwent intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) at a total dose of 60 Gy in combination with oral temozolo-mide chemotherapy. The frequency of radiation treatment was 2 Gy/day x30 fractions. The data are not conclusive of a correlation between the incidence of glioma and<sup>131</sup>I treatment. But, the incidence of long-term survival of the patients with thyroid cancer and second primary cancer warrants considerable attention by medical professionals. In addition, during radioactive iodine therapy, the indication and the total dose of the radioactive iodine require careful monitoring. Copyright Â© 2017, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

3762,"Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors: The Impact of Treatment on Patient Outcome Primary central nervous system (CNS) germinoma is readily curable with relatively large volume/high dose radiotherapy but the late effects of treatment may alter neurocognitive functioning and quality of life. Prior studies have associated radiation therapy with deficits in the domains of intelligence, attention, memory, and psychomotor processing speed, with risk factors including young age at irradiation and increased irradiation volume and dosage level. Furthermore, cranial irradiation may also lead to diminished height, neuroendocrine dysfunction, and hearing loss. Few germ cell tumor follow-up studies have adequately examined the late effects of therapy, with results varying between lowered physical quality of life without significant cognitive sequelae to significant correlations between young age at treatment and lowered levels of intellectual functioning and quality of life. Consequently, further investigation is warranted that includes baseline and biannual psychological assessments that focus beyond a singular measure of intelligence and provide data on a range of domains such as attention-concentration, memory and executive functioning, as well as quality of life, social-emotional and behavioral functioning. Since systemic and CNS germ cell tumors are highly sensitive to chemotherapy as well as to radiotherapy, future studies should examine whether the addition of chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy will permit response-based reductions in radiotherapy fields and allow the administration of doses that will translate into meaningful improvements in functional outcome with preservation of excellent long-term disease control.",Excluded
4677,"Effects of gambogic acid on the activation of caspase-3 and downregulation of SIRT1 in RPMI-8226 multiple myeloma cells via the accumulation of ROS Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most commonly diagnosed hematologic malignancy. Although new drugs, including bortezomib and lenalidomide, have improved the treatment landscape for MM patients, MM remains incurable. Therefore, screening for novel anti-myeloma drugs is necessary. Gambogic acid (GA), the main active ingredient of gamboges secreted from the Garcinia hanburryi tree, has been reported to exhibit potent anticancer activity in certain solid tumors and hematological malignancies, while there are few studies that are available concerning its effects on MM cells. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer activity of GA on the MM RPMI-8226 cells and further studied the underlying mechanisms by which GA affected the cells. RPMI-8226 cells were cultured and the effect of GA on cell proliferation was analyzed using MTT assay. Hoechst 33258 staining was used to visualize nuclear fragmentation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected. GA was found to have a significant, dose-dependent effect on growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in RPMI-8226 cells. This activity is associated with the accumulation of ROS, which contributes to the activation of caspase-3 and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), accompanied with apoptosis in RPMI-8226 cells treated with GA. Mammalian SIRT1, as the closest homolog of the yeast Sir2, was extensively involved in regulating cell processes, including cell senescence, aging and neuronal protection, as well as having anti-apoptotic properties. Moreover, SIRT1 overexpression has been shown to protect cancer cells from chemotherapy and ionizing radiation. In the present study, we demonstrated that GA has the potential to downregulate the expression of SIRT1 via ROS accumulation. In conclusion, our study found that GA is able to induce apoptosis in RPMI-8226 cells via ROS accumulation followed by caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage and SIRT1 downregulation. These results suggest that GA may have the potential to not only induce apoptosis in MM cells, but also to decrease the relapse rate of MM.",Excluded
4049,"Antioxidative and antiapoptotic genes expression in irradiated leukemia cells upon fullerenol nanoparticle treatment Recent data established the prospective applications for fullerenol (C<inf>60</inf>(OH)<inf>24</inf>) nanoparticle (FNP) in many fields, such as antioxidants, neuroprotective agents, and potential anti-radiation drugs. Leukemia cell sensitization to apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation is achieved by upregulation of ROS production and/or downregulation of antioxidative enzymes. Therefore, our aim was to analyze the potential role of fullerenol nanoparticle in modulation of the leukemic cellular response to irradiation. We used the qRT-PCR to analyze the expression level of mRNA for 11 genes in irradiated (IR) and FNP pre-treated irradiated cells (FNP + IR) K562 cells, and compared gene expression level with the overall cell survival, determined by DET and MTT assays. Interesting result of similar percentage of cell survival in FNP and FNP + IR groups (67.9% versus 63%), indicated the possible protective effect of FNP in irradiated cells. Under oxidative stress induced by radiation, cytoprotective genes such as GSTA4, MnSOD, NOS, CAT and HO-1 were upregulated in FNP pretreated K562 cells in comparison with control group, IR and FNP - treated non-irradiated cells. Amongst the antioxidative enzymes, only the mRNA of Cu, Zn - SOD (SOD-1) was downregulated, while gGT, GPX and GSTP1 were not significantly modulated in FNP-treated irradiated cells. Together with survival data and significant overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL genes, our results may indicate that FNP exerts cytoprotective function in K562 leukemic cells, rendering K562 cells more tolerant to radiotherapy.",Excluded

The rats were randomly divided into four equal groups. The control group did not receive melatonin or irradiation but received both 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally and sham irradiation. The irradiation (IR) group received 5 Gy gamma irradiation to the total cranium as a single dose plus 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally. The melatonin plus IR group received irradiation to the total cranium plus 5 mg/kg/day melatonin intraperitoneally. The melatonin group received only 5 mg/kg/day melatonin plus sham-irradiation. Biochemical parameters measured in murine lenses were carried out using spectrophotometric techniques.RESULTS: Lens antioxidant capacity, as measured by levels of total superoxide scavenger activity (TSSA), non-enzymatic superoxide scavenger activity (NSSA) and glutathione reductase (GRD) activity, significantly increased in melatonin, control and melatonin plus IR groups when compared with the IR group. Lens glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity significantly increased in control and melatonin groups when compared with the IR group. Lens malondialdehyde (MDA) levels significantly increased in the IR group when compared with control, melatonin and melatonin plus IR groups. Lens TSSA and NSSA activities significantly decreased in control and melatonin plus IR groups when compared with the melatonin group. Lens GST activity significantly increased in the control group when compared with melatonin plus IR group. Lens GRD activity significantly increased in melatonin and melatonin plus IR groups when compared with control group.CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin reduces oxidative stress markers and augments anti-oxidant capacity in the rat lens.",Included

[Chinese] Objective: To observe the clinical efficacy and safety of three-dimensional conformal therapy combined with icotinib or erlotinib in elderly and advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutations and brain metastases. Method(s): Seventy-six elderly and advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutations and brain metastases treated in our departments between November 2011 and November 2013 were randomly divided into two groups. Thirty-eight patients in treatment group received three-dimensional conformal radiation including primary tumors and metastases combined with icotinib (125 mg, tid, po), and the dose for pulmonary primary tumors and lung metastases was 36-60 Gy (2 Gy/d, 5 d/week), and for brain metastases the dose of whole brain radiotherapy was 30-40 Gy (2 Gy/d, 5 d/week), then increased dose of IMRT was 10-20 Gy (2 Gy/d, 5 d/week). Thirty-eight ones in the control group were treated with the same radiation regimen and erlotinib (150 mg, qd, po). The efficacy and toxicity were evaluated after two cycles. Result(s): The efficacy and toxicity could be evaluated in the 78 cases. The overall response rates were 63.2% and 57.9%, and the median progression free survival (PFS) was 9.9 and 9.0 months. Subgroup analysis showed that PFS in the two groups with different EGFR mutations was 11.2 and 10.6 months (19 exon deletion), 8.7 and 7.9 months (21 exon mutation), respectively, without significant difference (P>0.05). The most common toxicities of the two groups were rash, leukopenia, diarrhea and hepatic injury, which could be tolerated, with no significant difference (P>0.05).

The search for reliable markers of the disease that could be used for non invasive diagnostics is constantly needed. One of the hypotheses for gait impairment in NPH is the affection of periventricular white matter. METHODS In this study 15 patients were investigated for possible NPH. All patients underwent diagnostic testing (lumbar infusion test and 5 days of external lumbar drainage for diagnosis of NPH). Only the patients with positive diagnostic response were included in the study (n=10), all patients with postive response were finally treated by venriculoperitoneal shunt. All patients underwent MRI examination including T2W, T1W and DTI sequence of the whole brain in axial sections (EPI, TR/TE=12,000/ 89.4 ms, 40 slices with thickness of 2,4 mm, no gap, 128x 128 matrix, FOV 24x24 cm2; along 30 noncollinear gradient directions with b value of 1000 s/mm2, with additional five b=0 images). Anatomical 3D T1W sequence was also acquired. Twenty age matched subjects with Alzheimer disease resulting in marked atrophia and venricular dilatation, without clinical signs of NPH were examined with the same technique. Following parameters were then manually measured: fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in fornix, splenium of corpus callosum, genu of the internal capsule, and optic radiation. The ROIs were placed two slices above the slice where anterior comissure could be detected. A Mann Whitney U test was used for the analysis of the results. Tract based spatial statistics method (TBSS) was also used. RESULTS The fractional anisotropy was decreased significantly in the NPH patient group compared to the controls (p<0,01) in fornix, right genu of the capsula interna and left optical radiation (p< 0,05), the data showed some trend (p<0,1) in ADC of the left and right optical radiation. The results were similar using TBSS. CONCLUSION The DTI measurements may reveal the white matter structural imparirment in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus.

4672,"Quantitative Evaluation of Focused Ultrasound with a Contrast Agent on Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption The use of an ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) with focused ultrasound sonication has the potential to disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB) noninvasively and reversibly at target locations. This study investigated the effects of UCA dose and ultrasound pressure on BBB disruption. Sonications were applied at 1 MHz with a burst length of 10 ms, a 1% duty cycle and a repetition frequency of 1 Hz. The duration of the sonication was 30 s. In in vivo experiments, 16 male Wistar rats were sonicated in the presence of UCA at four doses (0, 30, 60 and 90 muL/kg). BBB integrity was evaluated by injecting Evans blue (EB) into the femoral vein of anesthetized rats. The relationship between UCA dose and the region of EB extravasation was evaluated at ultrasound pressures of 0.9 and 1.2 MPa. The BBB disruption, as quantified by the amount of EB extravasation, was significantly greater in rats injected with UCA at a dose of 60 or 90 muL/kg than at a dose of 0 or 30 muL/kg. The amount of EB extravasation increased monotonically with the quantity of UCA injected into the femoral vein before sonication. Furthermore, the BBB disruption could be enhanced in the focal region relative to the surrounding region with a higher dose of UCA (60 or 90 muL/kg). This study demonstrates that BBB disruption can be both increased and localized to the focal region by injecting an appropriate quantity of UCA before performing focused ultrasound sonications.

3851,"Cerebral Cortex Regions Selectively Vulnerable to Radiation Dose-Dependent Atrophy PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: Neurologic deficits after brain radiation therapy (RT) typically involve decline in higher-order cognitive functions such as attention and memory rather than sensory defects or paralysis. We sought to determine whether areas of the cortex critical to cognition are selectively vulnerable to radiation dose-dependent atrophy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We measured change in cortical thickness in 54 primary brain tumor patients who underwent fractionated, partial brain RT. The study patients underwent high-resolution, volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (T1-weighted; T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, FLAIR) before RT and 1 year afterward. Semiautomated software was used to segment anatomic regions of the cerebral cortex for each patient. Cortical thickness was measured for each region before RT and 1 year afterward. Two higher-order cortical regions of interest (ROIs) were tested for association between radiation dose and cortical thinning: entorhinal (memory) and inferior parietal (attention/memory). For comparison, 2 primary cortex ROIs were also tested: pericalcarine (vision) and paracentral lobule (somatosensory/motor). Linear mixed-effects analyses were used to test all other cortical regions for significant radiation dose-dependent thickness change. Statistical significance was set at alpha = 0.05 using 2-tailed tests.RESULTS: Cortical atrophy was significantly associated with radiation dose in the entorhinal (P=.01) and inferior parietal ROIs (P=.02). By contrast, no significant radiation dose-dependent effect was found in the primary cortex ROIs (pericalcarine and paracentral lobule). In the whole-cortex analysis, 9 regions showed significant radiation dose-dependent atrophy, including areas responsible for memory, attention, and executive function (P<=.002).CONCLUSIONS: Areas of cerebral cortex important for higher-order cognition may be most vulnerable to radiation-related atrophy. This is consistent with clinical observations that brain radiation patients experience deficits in domains of memory, executive function, and attention. Correlations of regional cortical atrophy with domain-specific cognitive functioning in prospective trials are warranted.",Excluded

RT and vemurafenib are being increasingly used concurrently, although little is known about the potential side effects of this combination. Vemurafenib is known to cause severe cutaneous skin reactions such as phototoxicity and evidence is accumulating that RT may further enhance these side effects.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report two cases of unusual skin reactions occurring during and after treatment with a combination of vemurafenib and whole-brain irradiation in patients with cerebral metastases arising from malignant melanomas.RESULTS: One case report describes excessive acute radiodermatitis which arose during whole-brain irradiation in combination with vemurafenib. The second describes a late skin reaction occurring approximately 30 days after completion of RT.CONCLUSION: These two case reports show that combination of both treatment modalities is possible, but requires close monitoring of patients and good interdisciplinary collaboration.",Excluded
4108,"Stress response of a p53 homologue in the radioresistant Sf9 insect cells PURPOSE: To investigate homology and stress response of p53 (a 53 kDa tumor suppressor protein) orthologue in Sf9 Lepidopteran insect cell line that exhibits very high radioresistance.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Western immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, degenerate RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay, flow cytometry and immuno-fluorescence microscopy were used for characterizing structural and functional features of Sfp53 (Spodoptera frugiperda p53) in gamma-irradiated or etoposide-treated Sf9 insect and BMG-1 (brain malignant glioma) human cells. Cells were pre-treated with caffeine for inhibiting ATM/ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein/ATM and Rad-3-related protein) activation, wherever required.RESULTS: A 47-49 kDa protein band was observed with antibodies against three different epitopes, demonstrating conservation of respective domains in Sfp53. Immunoprecipitation also yielded similar-sized protein. Degenerate RT-PCR resulted in product of same size in both cell lines. Similar gel mobility shift of p53-binding oligonucleotide with BMG-1 and Sf9 cell lysates indicated analogous transcriptional activity of Sfp53. Constitutive Sfp53 level was higher than hp53 (human p53) and showed primarily cytoplasmic localization. Radiation-induced accumulation was considerably less in Sf9 even as an analogous ATM/ATR-dependent nuclear translocation was observed following gamma-irradiation and etoposide.CONCLUSIONS: A smaller-sized Sfp53 orthologue shows highly conserved native structure with DNA-binding, N-terminus and C-terminus domains, and has analogous p53 transcriptional activity. While its nuclear translocation and ATM/ATR dependence were similar to hp53, the cytoplasmic localization and subdued accumulation following gamma-irradiation indicate functional differences from human cells.",Included

Noise is inevitable in neuronal systems and can change the electrical activities of neuron in different ways. Many previous theoretical studies about the impacts of noise on spiral waves focus an unbounded Gaussian noise and even colored noise. In this paper, the impacts of bounded noise and rewiring of network on the formation and instability of spiral waves are discussed in small-world (SW) network of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons through numerical simulations, and possible statistical analysis will be carried out. Firstly, we present SW network of HH neurons subjected to bounded noise. Then, it is numerically demonstrated that bounded noise with proper intensity sigma, amplitude A, or frequency f can facilitate the formation of spiral waves when rewiring probability p is below certain thresholds. In other words, bounded noise-induced resonant behavior can occur in the SW network of neurons. In addition, rewiring probability p always impairs spiral waves, while spiral waves are confirmed to be robust for small p, thus shortcut-induced phase transition of spiral wave with the increase of p is induced. Furthermore, statistical factors of synchronization are calculated to discern the phase transition of spatial pattern, and it is confirmed that larger factor of synchronization is approached with increasing of rewiring probability p, and the stability of spiral wave is destroyed.",Excluded

Survival times were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Seventeen patients with neurocytoma were treated, age at diagnosis 16.8 - 66.8 years; (median 35.3 years). Thirteen patients were male, all were Caucasian. Most common presenting symptoms: headaches (n=12) and gait disturbance (n=3). Sixteen patients had intraventricular lesions. All patients underwent surgery (gross total resection, GTR: 5, subtotal resection, STR: 10). Three patients (2 with STR and 1 with a biopsy) underwent adjuvant radiation; 2 with fractionated RT and one with stereotactic radiosurgery. Median event free survival (EFS) was 6.3 years and the projected 10 year EFS was 23%. Overall survival (OS) was 92%. The degree of resection did not correlate with EFS. After median follow-up of 8.4 years, 5 patients are without evidence of disease, 4 of which had developed recurrent disease and subsequently underwent GTR. Patients treated with adjuvant radiation did not experience disease recurrence (n=3). Twelve patients had Ki-67 results available from diagnosis (median 1.3%,), 4 had Ki-67 results at recurrence which was invariably higher than at presentation (median 10.5%) Ki-67 was not predictive for EFS or OS. Conclusion(s): In this cohort of patients, median EFS was only 6.3 years, and suggested a possible benefit to adjuvant radiotherapy in select cases.

We evaluated the effects of palliative radiotherapy for cancer recurrence or metastasis on patient QOL and psychophysiology. Material and Methods A total of 67 patients who received palliative radiotherapy between 2014 and 2015 were enrolled. Patient diseases were bone metastasis in 51 patients, lymph node metastasis in 7 patients, brain metastasis in 2 patients, local recurrence in 3 patients, and the others in 4 patients. Median irradiated dose was 30 Gy in 10 fractions for palliative radiotherapy. We used the questionnaires EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-C15-PAL to evaluate patient QOL and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate patient mental healthcare at the start and at the end of radiotherapy. Results As compared to scores at the start of radiotherapy, at the end of radiotherapy, numerical rating scale (NRS) and face scale significantly decreased. On the other hand, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) did not show no changes during palliative radiotherapy. In functional scales, average scores of role functioning (RF2) and emotional functioning (EF) also improved. In symptom scales, average scores of fatigue (FA), pain (PA), and insomnia (SL) improved. In bone metastasis group, global health status / QOL (QL2), PA, and SL significantly improved. After palliative radiotherapy, anxiety score of HADS was elevated below age of 70 years.

Conclusion(s): HFRT and CCT for T3 and T4 NPC were associated with good local control, survival and little treatment-related long term toxicity. But, the 10 year treatment result is suboptimal. To further improve the 10 year locoregional control rate for T4 NPC patients, we may consider using HFRT to give higher radiation dose up to 78 Gy with CCT in the IMRT era.",Excluded

3940,"Skeletal muscle metastasis presenting as an initial manifestation of lung cancer INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer, the most common cancer worldwide, presents as a metastatic disease in majority of the cases. The most frequent sites of distant metastases are liver, adrenal glands, bones, and brain. Skeletal muscle metastasis as a mode of presentation of lung cancer is a rare phenomenon which is often discovered at autopsy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old male, with forty pack years history of smoking, presented with a painful right, distal thigh swelling for two months and unintentional weight loss of twenty pounds. Examination of right distal thigh revealed a tender, hard, non fluctuant mass, with surrounding erythema. Complete blood count, basic metabolic and hepatic function panel were unremarkable. Chest x ray showed large mass in right lower lobe with a smaller nodule in the right upper lobe which was confirmed by computed tomography ( CT) of the chest. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right lower extremity showed 5.5 x 4.0 x 6.2 cm soft tissue mass in lateral aspect of the distal thigh adjacent to femur. The patient underwent CT guided biopsies of the right lower lobe lung mass and the right thigh mass. Pathology of the lung mass revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (immunostaining positive for cytokeratin and thyroid transcription factor-1) and that of the right thigh mass revealed poorly differentiated malignant tumor most consistent with metastatic non small cell carcinoma (immunostaining positive for cytokeratin). Positron-emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) demonstrated hypermetabolic right lower lobe lung mass and right upper lobe lung nodule, a large right knee soft tissue mass and multiple hypermetabolic soft tissue lesions throughout the muscles of the body along with jugular, external iliac and inguinal hypermetabolic lymphadenopathies. The patient was started on palliative radiation to the right distal thigh. Chemotherapy was not administered due to rapidly deteriorating clinical status. The patient died of septic shock within 4 weeks of diagnosis. DISCUSSION: Skeletal muscle is an exceptionally rare site of metastasis of lung cancer(1). The local pH and the contractile property of skeletal muscle do not favor metastasis. Delay in the diagnosis may occur due to its clinical and radiological resemblance to diseases like abscess and soft tissue sarcoma. Definitive diagnosis requires biopsy of the muscle mass. Treatment is palliative, and majority of the patients die within 1 year of diagnosis (2,3) CONCLUSION(S): Lung cancer with skeletal muscle metastasis should be considered as a potential differential diagnosis in patients presenting with intramuscular mass.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of PCI in this population.METHODS: We retrospectively identified completely resected SCLC at the Shanghai Chest Hospital between January 2006 and January 2014.RESULTS: A total of 349 patients (115 patients who received PCI [the PCI-treated cohort] and 234 patients who did not [the non-PCI-treated cohort]) were included in the study. The results demonstrated that the PCI-treated cohort had longer overall survival than the non-PCI-treated cohort among patients with pathologic stage (p-stage) II (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30-0.99, p = 0.047) and p-stage III (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34-0.86, p = 0.009) disease. Among patients with p-stage III disease, there was a significantly higher risk for cerebral recurrence from the time of diagnosis in the non-PCI-treated cohort (p = 0.018). With regard to patients with p-stage I disease, neither overall survival benefit (HR = 1.61, 95% CI: 0.68-3.83, p = 0.282) nor risk for cerebral recurrence (p = 0.389) was significant between the PCI-treated and non-PCI-treated cohorts.CONCLUSIONS: The data presented in the current study support using PCI in patients with p-stage II/III disease but not in patients with p-stage I disease. A relatively lower risk for brain metastases in p-stage I patients might explain the inferior efficacy of PCI in this population.",Included

[Japanese] Intratumoral hemodynamic changes after fractionated cobalt teletherapy were comparatively investigated in 10 patients with malignant glioma using Dynamic- CT and DCE-CT. 1) The peak time in dynamic-CT scanning decreased by an average of 43% after 10 to 20 Gy of cobalt irradiation. 2) The peak value in dynamic- CT scanning, in contrast to peak time, increased by an average of 120 % after 10 to 20 Gy of cobalt irradiation. 3) The peak value measured by DCE-CT scanning usually peaked after 10 to 20 Gy of irradiation, similar to dynamic-CT scanning findings, though the increase was statistically insignificant. 4) The 50% clearance time decreased by an average of 45% after 10 to 20 Gy of cobalt irradiation.

4238,"Up-regulation of the expression of cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide by electroacupuncture in the arcuate nucleus of diet-induced obese rats It was reported that acupuncture or electro-acupuncture (EA) is effective in reducing the body weight for obese patients, although the mechanisms remain obscure. In a previous study, we have found that rats fed with high-fat (HIF) diet developed diet-induced obesity (DIO) with a concomitant decrease in the hypothalamic content of the cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide, a peptide with anorexiogenic effect. To assess the central effect of EA on DIO rat, we revealed that EA up-regulated the expression of CART peptide in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the DIO rats. After feeding with HIF diet for 14 weeks, the DIO rats received EA stimulation three times per week for 4 weeks. The expression of CART peptide in ARC was measured using immunohistochemistry. The plasma ACTH was measured with ELISA. EA caused a reduction of both body weight and energy intake in DIO rats and increased the expression of CART peptide in ARC. The plasma ACTH was increased in response to restraint stress, but EA produced no further increase in ACTH levels. The results suggest that EA can up-regulate the expression of CART peptide to approach normal level, resulting in an inhibition of food intake and a reduction of body weight in DIO rats.",Excluded
4313,"Does the radioactive iodine dose affect smell, taste sensation and nose function? OBJECTIVE: To detect whether the adverse effects of post-operative radioactive iodine therapy following differentiated thyroid cancer on smell, taste and nasal functions were associated with radioactive iodine dose.METHODS: Fifty-one patients who had undergone total thyroidectomy because of differentiated thyroid cancer were divided into two groups depending on the post-operative radioactive iodine therapy dose: low dose group (50 mCi; 21 patients) and high dose group (100-150 mCi; 30 patients). The Sniffin' Sticks smell test, the Taste Strips test and the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test were performed on all patients one week before therapy, and at two months and one year following therapy.RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were detected in the Sniffin' Sticks test results, total odour scores, total taste scores and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test results between the assessment time points. There was no statistically significant difference between the low and high dose groups in terms of odour, taste or Sino-Nasal Outcome Test scores either before or after therapy.CONCLUSION: Radioactive iodine therapy has some short- and long-term adverse effects on nasal functions and taste and odour sensations, which affect quality of life.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed enormous ipsilateral brain oedema, which did not respond to dexamethasone. Upon further neurological deterioration the former AVM nidus plus an adjacent rim of brain tissue were removed and the patient recovered considerably.

4540,"Research progress on mechanism and dosimetry of brainstem injury induced by intensity-modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy, and heavy ion radiotherapy Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective method for treating head and neck cancer (HNC). However, RT may cause side effects during and after treatment. Radiation-induced brainstem injury (BSI) is often neglected due to its low incidence and short survival time and because it is indistinguishable from intracranial tumor progression. It is currently believed that the possible mechanism of radiation-induced BSI includes increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and damage of vascular endothelial cells, neurons, and glial cells as well as an inflammatory response and oxidative stress. At present, it is still difficult to avoid BSI even with several advanced RT techniques. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is the most commonly used therapeutic technique in the field of RT. Compared with early conformal therapy, it has greatly reduced the injury to normal tissues. Proton beam radiotherapy (PBT) and heavy ion radiotherapy (HIT) have good dose distribution due to the presence of a Bragg peak, which not only results in better control of the tumor but also minimizes the dose to the surrounding normal tissues. There are many clinical studies on BSI caused by IMRT, PBT, and HIT. In this paper, we review the mechanism, dosimetry, and other aspects of BSI caused by IMRT, PBT, and HIT.Key Points* Enhanced MRI imaging can better detect radiation-induced BSI early.* This article summarized the dose constraints of brainstem toxicity in clinical studies using different techniques including IMRT, PBT, and HIT and recommended better dose constraints pattern to clinicians.* The latest pathological mechanism of radiation-induced BSI and the corresponding advanced treatment methods will be discussed.",Excluded
3645,"Radiation therapy for melanoma: Adjuvant, palliative and abscopal effects Radiation therapy (RT) has long played a role in the management of melanoma, however historically its efficacy has been questioned due to the perceived radioresistance of melanoma cells in vitro. Apart from proton therapy for choroidal melanoma, RT has limited accepted indications as a definitive treatment. Surgery remains the first line therapy of choice for operable patients and adjuvant RT can be considered for high-risk primary tumours. Prospective randomised data are awaited following a Phase II TROG study reporting high local control rates (93%) following postoperative nodal irradiation in selected patients with node-positive melanoma. High response rates of melanoma (e.g. mucosal or inoperable) to primary radiotherapy have also been reported. Local radiation can achieve tumour-antigen release and clinical results suggest biological interaction with immunomodulating agents (a checkpoint inhibitor and anti-CTLA4 antibody), corroborated by preclinical data. Much interest also lies in enhancing melanoma radiation response rates through combination with clinical hyperthermia, which can achieve radiosensitisation, at least in part, by immune modulation. Novel developments in radiotherapy include the rise in radiosurgical treatment (SRS), involving high dose, small volume irradiation. SRS is increasingly the palliation of choice for patients with two or more brain metastases, following resection of a single brain metastasis and for extra-cranial oligometastases. The results of a Phase III trial evaluating whole brain radiotherapy are awaited. The radiobiological consequences of SRS may be even more immunomodulatory, congruent with retrospective data that fraction sizes greater than 4 Gray are more effective and SRS alone has been suggested to induce an abscopal effect. To date there are limited data reporting SRS with concomitant immunomodulators and the optimal combinations remain to be defined. Serious toxicities have been reported following administration of B-RAF inhibitors with and subsequent to both SRS and fractionated RT. Combination strategies are being actively researched as these should increase the effectiveness of radiation in the management of patients with melanoma by widening the therapeutic window between normal tissue toxicity and melanoma cell kill, and by potentially inducing an out-offield abscopal effect.",Excluded

Expert listeners rated voice and speech quality (based on Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain), articulation (overall, [p], [t], [k]), and comparative mean opinion scores of voice and speech at three assessment points calculated. A structured study-specific questionnaire evaluated patients' perception pretreatment (N=55), at 10-week (N=49) and 1-year posttreatment (N=37).RESULTS: At 10 weeks, perceptual voice quality is significantly affected. The parameters overall voice quality (mean, -0.24; P=0.008), strain (mean, -0.12; P=0.012), nasality (mean, -0.08; P=0.009), roughness (mean, -0.22; P=0.001), and pitch (mean, -0.03; P=0.041) improved over time but not beyond baseline levels, except for asthenia at 1-year posttreatment (voice is less asthenic than at baseline; mean, +0.20; P=0.03). Perceptual analyses of articulation showed no significant differences. Patients judge their voice quality as good (score, 18/20) at all assessment points, but at 1-year posttreatment, most of them (70%) judge their ""voice not as it used to be."" In the 1-year versus 10-week posttreatment comparison, the larynx-hypopharynx tumor group was more strained, whereas nonlarynx tumor voices were judged less strained (mean, -0.33 and +0.07, respectively; P=0.031).

The purpose of this study was to use endocrine data from existing publications to characterise the baseline endocrine status, the effects of radiotherapy on the HPA during the first follow-up year and the time dependence of radiation-induced HPA dysfunction in patients treated with radiotherapy for non-pituitary intracranial neoplasms.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search of databases was carried out for articles that reported the results of endocrine testing for patients aged 16 years and older who were treated with neurosurgery for non-pituitary intracranial neoplasms or radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal neoplasms. To analyse the radiotherapy-related changes in hormone levels over time, long-term prospective endocrine data from nasopharyngeal studies were normalised to baseline hormone data and fitted to an exponential decay model. This process was repeated with normalisation to year 1 hormone data.RESULTS: Eight unique articles met eligibility criteria. HPA dysfunction occurred in 21.6-64.7% of patients who were assessed for endocrinopathies following neurosurgery. Studies on the early effects of radiotherapy on nasopharyngeal patients showed statistically significant changes in growth hormone, luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels during the first year of follow-up. Time dependence modelling showed that normalisation to year 1 hormone levels yield exponential equations with stronger measures of goodness of fit.CONCLUSION: HPA dysfunction in patients treated for non-pituitary intracranial neoplasms is probably a result of both neurosurgery and radiotherapy treatments. Although statistically significant endocrine changes can occur during this first year of follow-up, those documented at year 1 may be more predictive of subsequent HPA dysfunction.",Excluded

Feasibility, safety and radiation exposure considerations BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose was to investigate our centre's experience on computed-tomography-guided (CT-guided), transforaminal, intrathecal administration of nusinersen in adult subjects with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 2 and severe spinal deformity.METHOD: This is a retrospective, single-centre study investigating the feasibility and safety of CT-guided, transforaminal, lumbar puncture for the intrathecal administration of nusinersen (Spinranza R; Biogen; Cambridge, MA, USA) in a cohort of adult subjects with SMA type 2, severe neuromuscular scoliosis and previous spinal surgery. Between January 2019 and October 2019, five male, adult, SMA type 2 subjects were eligible to be treated in our centre with nusinersen. The mean age of the patients was 31 +/- 9 years (range 19-43 years). The study's outcome measures were technical success, adverse events and radiation exposure.RESULTS: In total, four patients completed the four loading doses, whilst the fifth patient received only one loading dose; two patients also received their first maintenance doses. Overall, 20 consecutive transforaminal, intrathecal treatments were analysed. Technical success was 100% (20/20 intrathecal infusions). No adverse events were documented following the procedures. Mean dose-length product (DLP) value per injection was 665.4 +/- 715.5 mGy*cm. Estimated mean effective dose per injection was 12.7 +/- 12.9 mSv. Subgroup analysis between the chronologically first 10 versus subsequent 10 procedures demonstrated a clear trend towards less radiation exposure in the latter, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (DLP: 984.7 +/- 903.3 vs. 436.7 +/- 321.5 mGy*cm, P = 0.165; respectively).CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective series, CT-guided transforaminal access for intrathecal injection of nusinersen was proven feasible and safe.

4081,"Patterns of Failure after Stereotactic Radiosurgery of the Resection Cavity Following Surgical Removal of Brain Metastases BACKGROUND: Whole brain radiation treatment (WBRT) is considered standard treatment for BM. However, exposing large volumes of normal brain tissue to irradiation can cause neurotoxicity. This study describes our experience with 100 consecutive patients with brain metastases who were managed with surgical extirpation followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the resection cavity.METHODS: Patients with 1-3 brain metastases (BM), who underwent resection of 1-2 BM between June 2005 and December 2013, were treated with SRS directed to the tumor cavity and for any synchronous BM. Local and distant treatment failures were determined based on neuroimaging. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for local and distant failure rates and overall survival.RESULTS: One hundred and two resection cavities were treated with SRS in 100 consecutive patients. Thirty-two additional synchronous metastases were treated in 27 patients during the same session. The median overall survival was 18.9 months. Local control rate at 1 year was 84%. Longer delays between surgery and SRS were associated with increased risk of local failure (hazard ratio, -1.46; P = 0.02). Distant progression occurred in 44% of the patients at a mean of 8.8 +/- 6.6 months after SRS treatment. Ten cases of leptomeningeal spread occurred around the resection cavities (9.8%). Central nervous system failure was not significantly associated with survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that recursive partitioning analysis and active systemic disease were significantly associated with survival.CONCLUSION: The strategy described provides acceptable local disease control when compared with WBRT following surgery. This approach can delay and even annul WBRT in the majority of selected BM patients, especially recursive partitioning analysis class I patients. SRS should be scheduled as soon as possible after surgery.",Excluded
4625,"Adaptive replanning strategies accounting for shrinkage in head and neck IMRT PURPOSE: Significant anatomic and volumetric changes occur in head and neck cancer patients during fractionated radiotherapy, and the actual dose can be considerably different from the original plan. The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate the differences between planned and delivered dose, (2) to investigate margins required for anatomic changes, and (3) to find optimal replanning strategies.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eleven patients, each with one planning and six weekly helical CTs, were included. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans were generated using the simultaneous integrated boost technique. Weekly CTs were rigidly registered to planning CT before deformable registration was performed. The following replanning strategies were investigated with different margins (0, 3, 5 mm): midcourse (one replan), every other week (two replans), and every week (six replans). Doses were accumulated on the planning CT for comparison of various dose indices for target and critical structures.RESULTS: The cumulative doses to targets were preserved even at the 0-mm margin. Doses to cord, brainstem, and mandible were unchanged. Significant increases in parotid doses were observed. Margin reduction from 5 to 0 mm led to a 22% improvement in parotid mean dose. Parotid sparing could be preserved with replanning. More frequent replanning led to better preservation; replanning more than once a week is unnecessary.CONCLUSION: Shrinkage does not result in significant dosimetric difference in targets and critical structures, except for the parotid gland, for which the mean dose increases by approximately 10%. The benefit of replanning is improved sparing of the parotid. The combination of replanning and reduced margins can provide up to a 30% difference in parotid dose.",Excluded
4718,"Light-induced hormone conversion of T4 to T3 regulates photoperiodic response of gonads in birds Reproduction of many temperate zone birds is under photoperiodic control. The Japanese quail is an excellent model for studying the mechanism of photoperiodic time measurement because of its distinct and marked response to changing photoperiods. Studies on this animal have suggested that the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) is an important centre controlling photoperiodic time measurement. Here we report that expression in the MBH of the gene encoding type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2), which catalyses the intracellular deiodination of thyroxine (T4) prohormone to the active 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), is induced by light in Japanese quail. Intracerebroventricular administration of T3 mimics the photoperiodic response, whereas the Dio2 inhibitor iopanoic acid prevents gonadal growth. These findings demonstrate that light-induced Dio2 expression in the MBH may be involved in the photoperiodic response of gonads in Japanese quail.",Excluded
4070,"Cancer therapy, vomiting, and antiemetics Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy for cancer are capable of causing nausea and vomiting. With both treatment modalities, the nausea and vomiting is thought to be a second-order process rather than being due to direct stimulation of neuromechanisms that control vomiting. Both a peripheral (gastrointestinal tract) and central (chemoreceptor trigger zone) effect may be operating with both radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-induced vomiting. With radiotherapy, gastrointestinal toxicity is affected by the type of radiation, radiation dose and field size, fractionation schedule, individual patient factors, and the part of the patient that is radiated. Many different factors also influence the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy. With both radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting is probably mediated by a reduction in breakdown of various neurotransmitters. It is presumed that as the levels of neurotransmitters increase, nausea and vomiting develop. Antagonists of these neurotransmitters may afford some antiemetic protection. Nausea and vomiting may be so severe in patients with cancer that they may refuse potentially curative therapy because of it. Anticipatory nausea and vomiting may develop in patients who have become quite sick after receiving treatment. Exposure to stimuli associated with the emetogenic agent is then sufficient to trigger nausea and vomiting. Standard antiemetics do not help anticipatory nausea and vomiting, although behavioural training may. A variety of different drugs have proven useful as antiemetics, including dopamine antagonists such as phenothiazines, metoclopramide, corticosteroids (dexamethasone and methylprednisolone), cannabinoids, and benzodiazapines. Antihistamines and anticholinergics are of value in some situations. New serotonin antagonists appear to be very promising and are currently undergoing clinical studies. Multiagent antiemetic regimens appear to be more effective than single agent regimens in some situations. [References: 123]",Excluded
3845,"Principles of diagnostic sonography in iliopsoas tendon pathology: A case report This article describes the diagnostic value of musculoskeletal sonography in the management of tendon pathology and outlines a clinical example of its scope of utilization. Herein we describe the case of a 65-year-old man who sought rehabilitation services for left groin pain following a period of intense trekking and uphill walking. He presented with left hip flexor weakness and local tenderness over the left iliopsoas tendon with negative findings on neurological evaluation. Additionally, he presented with left hip capsule and hip flexor tightness with left gluteus maximus and gluteus medius weakness. The left hip capsule tightness was predominantly in the posterior fibres, with restriction of hip internal rotation. The clinical picture overall was suggestive of the presence of risk parameters for iliopsoas tendinopathy. Plain radiographs of the hip revealed mild degenerative changes with a mild pincer impingement. While his clinical and radiological picture was suggestive of degenerative and soft tissue pathology of the hip, a real-time sonographic study was useful in the quantitative confirmation of a partial tear of the left iliopsoas tendon. Additionally, a repeat sonographic study performed four weeks later, revealed a healing iliopsoas tendon seen as a decrease in the width of the hypoechoic presentation of the tear. To summarize, the value of musculoskeletal sonography as a diagnostic tool as well as the assessment of the progression of tendon healing is discussed. Sonography is safe, noninvasive, and does not use ionizing radiation. It is steadily gaining popularity in the diagnosis of tendon lesions.",Excluded

4111,"Effect of photic stimuli disturbing overt circadian rhythms on the dorsomedial and ventrolateral SCN rhythmicity To ascertain how photic stimuli disturbing overt circadian rhythms affect the endogenous rhythmicity of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), rats were subjected to constant light (LL) or to a 9-h light pulse encompassing midnight, and rhythms of abundance of the c-Fos-immunoreactive (c-Fos-ir) and the PER1-immunoreactive (PER1-ir) cells were studied during the first 1-2 cycles following release into LL or darkness (DD) within the whole SCN as well as in its ventrolateral (vl) and the dorsomedial (dm) part. LL seemingly abolished the c-Fos rhythm in the whole SCN, while the rhythm persisted in the vl- and dm-SCN. In the dm-SCN, the rhythm of c-Fos-ir was phase-delayed by about 4 h in LL, whereas the rhythm of PER1-ir was affected just slightly. In the vl-SCN, the rhythm of c-Fos photo-induction might be delayed by 5-6 h as compared with the reported rhythm [A. Sumova and H. Illnerova, Am. J. Physiol. 274 (1998) R857-R863], whereas the PER1 profile appeared to be out of phase with that in DD. After a 9-h light pulse encompassing midnight, the rhythm of PER1-ir in the dm-SCN changed just slightly, whereas the PER1 rhythm in the vl-SCN was abolished and there was just an indication of extension of elevated PER1-ir. Altogether, the data indicate that photic stimuli disturbing circadian rhythms affect more dramatically the vl- than the dm-SCN rhythmicity within the first cycles and that in the dm-SCN shifting of the c-Fos rhythm proceeds more rapidly than that of the Per1 rhythm.",Excluded
4055,"Therapeutic resistance in breast cancer cells can result from deregulated EGFR signaling The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) interacts with various downstream molecules including phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC), Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/Akt/GSK-3, Jak/STAT and others. Often these pathways are deregulated in human malignancies such as breast cancer. Various therapeutic approaches to inhibit the activity of EGFR family members including small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) have been developed. A common problem with cancer treatments is the development of drug-resistance. We examined the effects of a conditionally-activated EGFR (v-Erb-B:ER) on the resistance of breast cancer cells to commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, paclitaxel, cisplatin and 5-flurouracil as well as ionizing radiation (IR). v-Erb-B is similar to the EGFR-variant EGFRvIII, which is expressed in various cancers including breast, brain, prostate. Both v-Erb-B and EGFRvIII encode the EGFR kinase domain but lack key components present in the extracellular domain of EGFR which normally regulate its activity and ligand-dependence. The v-Erb-B oncogene was ligated to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER) which results in regulation of the activity of the v-Erb-ER construct by addition of either estrogen (E2) or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) to the culture media. Introduction of the v-Erb-B:ER construct into the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line increased the resistance to the cells to various chemotherapeutic drugs, hormonal-based therapeutics and IR. These results point to the important effects that aberrant expression of EGFR kinase domain can have on therapeutic resistance.",Excluded
3668,"A reappraisal of the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited small cell lung cancer The use of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited stage small cell lung cancer remains controversial. Prospective trials have demonstrated that PCI can reduce central nervous system relapse rates, but the impact on survival remains questionable except for the possible evidence of a beneficial effect for long term survivors. With higher rates of thoracic control now obtainable with hyperfractionated radiation and concomitant chemotherapy, it becomes important to analyze the benefit of PCI in that setting. Before 1982, we included PCI in the management of all patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer; thereafter, we discontinued its use. This report compares the outcome of the two treatment approaches and addresses the role of PCI among patients who achieve durable local control. There were 36 limited stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with PCI from 1979-1982 and 26 patients treated without PCI from 1985-1989. Induction chemotherapy was followed in both groups by thoracic irradiation (45 Gy). The PCI patients received 30 Gy to the whole brain in 10 fractions. Both groups received maintenance chemotherapy. Of complete responders, brain failure was the first failure in 18% (4/22) of PCI (+) versus 45% (10/22) of PCI (-) (p = .04). Survival at 2 years was 42% for PCI (+) versus 13% for PCI (-) (p less than .05). When the analysis was limited to those patients permanently controlled in the thorax; there were 25% (4/16) brain failures PCI (+) versus 70% (7/10) PCI (-) (p = .03). For this same subset the 2-year survival was 56% PCI (+) versus 14% PCI (-) (p less than .05). There were no 5 year survivors without PCI compared to 38% (6/16) with PCI. These data suggest that PCI appears to be effective in enhancing survival of patients who achieve durable thoracic control. Prospective trials are necessary to evaluate the use of PCI combined with therapeutic regimens with a documented ability to achieve high rates of sustained control of thoracic disease.",Excluded

The transmission of a cw probe laser beam at 660 nm corresponding to the peak absorption of the first excited L-state, through the LOV2 sample, is switched by a pulsed pump laser beam at 442 nm that corresponds to the maximum initial D state absorption. The switching characteristics have been analyzed using the rate equation approach, considering all the three intermediate states and transitions in the LOV2 photocycle. It is shown that for a given pump pulse intensity, there is an optimum pump pulsewidth for which the switching contrast is maximum. It is shown that the probe laser beam can be completely switched off (100% modulation) by the pump laser beam at 50 kW/cm2 for a concentration of 1 mM with sample thickness of 5.5 mm. The switching characteristics are sensitive to various parameters such as concentration, rate constant of L-state, peak pump intensity and pump pulse width. At typical values, the switch-off and switch-on time is 1.6 and 22.3 micros, respectively.

4642,"Whole cell recordings of intrinsic properties and sound-evoked responses from the inferior colliculus Response features of inferior colliculus (IC) neurons to both current injections and tone bursts were studied with in vivo whole cell recordings in awake Mexican free-tailed bats. Of 160 cells recorded, 95% displayed one of three general types of discharge patterns in response to the injection of positive current: 1) sustained discharges; 2) adapting discharges; and 3) onset-bursting discharges. Sustained neurons were the most common type (N=78), followed by onset-bursting (N=57). The least common type was adapting (N=17). In 90 neurons the profiles of synaptic and discharge activity evoked by tones of different frequencies at 50 dB SPL were recorded. Three major tone-evoked response profiles were obtained; 1) neurons dominated by excitation (N=32) in which tones evoked excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) or EPSPs with discharges over a range of frequencies with little or no evidence of inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) evoked by frequencies that flanked the excitation; 2) neurons that had an excitatory frequency region in which discharges were evoked that was flanked by frequencies that evoked predominantly IPSPs (N=26); 3) neurons in which all frequencies evoked IPSPs with little or no depolarizations (N=32). The question we asked is whether IC cells that express a particular profile of PSPs and discharges to acoustic stimulation also have the same current-evoked response profile. We show that, with one exception, the intrinsic features of an IC neuron are not correlated with the pattern of its synaptic innervation; the two features are unrelated in the majority of IC cells. The exception is a subtype of inhibitory dominated cell where most frequencies evoked IPSPs to both the onset and to the offset of the tone bursts. In those cells injected current steps always evoked an onset-bursting response.",Excluded

3983,"Cancer pain (classification and pain syndromes) Inspite the new informations about the physiology and biochemistry of pain, it remains true that pain is only partially understood. Cancer pain is often experienced as several different types of pain, with combined somatic and neuropathic types the most frequently. If the acute cancer pain does not subside with initial therapy, patients experience pain of more constant nature, the characteristics of wich vary with the cause and the involved sites. Chronic pain related to cancer can be considered as tumor-induced pain, chemotherapy-induced pain, and radiation therapy-induced pain. Certain pain mechanisms are present in cancer patients. These include inflammation due to infection, such as local sepsis or the pain of herpes zoster, and pain due to the obstruction or occlusion of a hollow organ, such as that caused by large bowel in cancer of colon. Pain also is commonly due to destruction of tissue, such as is often seen with bony metastases. Bony metastases also produce pain because of periostal irritation, medullary pressure, and fractures. Pain may be produced by the growth of tumor in a closed area richly supplied with pain receptors (nociceptors). Examples are tumors growing within the capsule of an organ such as the pancreas. Chest pain occurring after tumor of the lung or the mediastinum due to invasion of the pleura. Certain tumors produce characteristic types of pain. For example, back pain is seen with multiple myeloma, and severe shoulder pain and arm pain is seen with Pancoast tumors. [References: 42]",Excluded

4188,Correlations of neuronal spike discharges of VL neurons during spontaneous firing and during the activity evoked by peripheral stimulation The temporal relations between simultaneously recorded neurons of the nucleus ventralis lateralis (VL) of cat thalamus were studied. The interaction and the functional connections between individual VL neurons are described. This was achieved with an application of cross correlation techniques. The response patterns of different individual neurons to somatic sensory and photic stimuli were also analyzed. For the purpose of classifying neurons as thalamocortical relay cells (T-C) and non relay cells (N-C) which do not project to the motor sensory cortex antidromic cortical stimulation was used. This stimulation was also used as conditioning one when proceeded peripheral stimuli. To analyze the nonspecific specific interactions upon single neurons conditioning photic stimuli were applied. The results show that T-C neurons are antidromically excited from a wide cortical areas and that the functional interaction between T-C neurons is mediated by a shared input from common sources. It is further postulated that N-C cells interposed between relay neurons subserve the functions of gating units modifying the neuronal network of lateral ventral nucleus of the thalamus.,Excluded
4335,"Edaravone protects ovaries from radiation-induced apoptosis Objective: Ovaries are very sensitive and prone to radiation-related damage. Radiation impairs the ovaries by triggering apoptosis of follicular cells and chromosomal damage and oxidative stress. Edaravone is a potent free radical scavenger, which has been clinically used to treat the neuronal damage following acute ischemic stroke. Our purpose is to evaluate the protective effects of edaravone and to investigate the histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in rat ovaries after radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty two Wistar albino female rats were randomly divided into four groups. 1: control group, 2: sham group (only radiation), 3: 450 mg/kg edaravone and radiation group, 4: 45 mg/kg edaravone and radiation group. Four days after radiation exposure, the rats were sacrificed and the ovaries were removed. Histologic changes under light microscopy and immunoreactivity for anticaspase-3 were noted and compared between the four groups. Result(s): There was a statistically significant difference in follicle counts, vascular congestion, edema, cytoplasmic vacuolization and interstitial cell degeneration between the groups. Radiation causes deterioration of histopathological parameters. Administration of edaravone at different doses seems to reverse these alterations and alleviate the injury. Antioxidant defense mechanisms appear to be enhanced by edaravone. Conclusion(s): This is the first study evaluating the protective effects of edaravone on radiation-induced ovarian damage.

Ground studies on neonatal rats using the tail suspension model of weightlessness have shown that the force of gravity clearly influences the events underlying the postnatal development of motor function. These effects depend on the age of the animal, duration of the perturbation and the motor function studied. A nine-day flight study has shown that a dam and neonates can develop under conditions of space flight. The motor function of the flight animals after landing was consistent with that seen in the tail suspension studies, being marked by limb joint extension. However, there were expected differences due to: (1) the unloading of the vestibular system in flight, which did not occur in the ground-based experiments; (2) differences between flight and suspension durations; and (3) the inability to evaluate motor function during the flight. The next step is to conduct experiments in space with the flexibility and rigor that is now limited to ground studies: an opportunity offered by the International Space Station.",Excluded

Measurements were performed by microdialysis using a membrane implanted through the upper CA1 region of the hippocampus. After irradiation with the 2.45 GHz RF, rats exposed at 2 mW/cm(2) did not show a significant modification of Ach release, whereas those exposed at 4 mW/cm(2) showed a significant 40% decrease in mean ACh release from hippocampus. This decrease was maximal at 5 h post exposure. Exposure to the 800 MHz RF for 1 h did not cause any significant effect, but exposure for 14 hrs induced a significant 43% decrease in ACh release during the period 11 p.m.-4 a.m. compared to control rats. In the control group we observed an increase of ACh release at the beginning of the night, which was linked to the waking period of rats. This normal increase was disturbed in rats exposed overnight to the 800 MHz RF.

Specifically, a spatio-temporal correlation tensor that characterizes the anisotropy of fMRI signals in white matter was introduced to complement the estimation of fiber orientation density function from DWI. The proposed method has been demonstrated to identify functional pathways implicated in fMRI task. It can effectively follow tracts in the genu of the corpus callosum that connects to the frontal lobe cortex, obtain connections between the thalamus and the anterior insula under sensory simulation, and reconstruct optic radiations in the visual circuit under visual stimulation.

Measurement were performed under extreme case scenarios wherein maximum secondary neutrons and photons were produced around CV, BTS and GTR3 by stopping 230MeV proton of 300nA on beam degrader, end of BTS and isocenter of GTR3. Weekly time average dose rate (TADR) were calculated from H*(10) value measured at selective hot spots by irradiating actual treatment plans of mix clinical sites.RESULTS: The maximum total H*(10) were within 2 microSv/hr around CV, 5 microSv/hr around outer wall of BTS which increases up to 62 microSv/hr at the end of inside BTS corridor. Maximum H*(10) of 20.8 microSv/hr in treatment control console (P125), 23.4 microSv/hr behind the common wall between GTR3 and GTR2 (P132) and 25.7 microSv/hr above isocenter (P99) were observed around GTR3. Reduction of beam current from 6 to 3 nA and 1 nA at nozzle exit lead to decrease in total H*(10) at P125 from 20.8 to 11.35 and 4.62 microSv/hr. In comparison to extreme case scenario, H*(10) value at P125, P132 and P99 from clinically relevant irradiation parameters were reduce by a factor ranging from 8.6 for high range cube to 46.4 for brain clinical plan. The maximum weekly TADR per fraction was highest for large volume, sacral chordoma patient at 8.5 microSv/hr compare to 0.3 microSv/hr for brain patient. The calculated weekly TADR for 30 mix clinical cases and 15 fractions of 1 L cube resulted total weekly TADR of 83-84 microSv/hr at P125, P132 and P99. The maximum annual dose level at these hot spots were estimated at 4.37 mSv/Yr.CONCLUSION: We have carried out an extensive measurement of H*(10) under different conditions. The shielding thickness of our PT facility is adequate to limit the dose to occupational worker and general public within the permissible stipulated limit.

4452,"Defining the mechanisms that underlie cortical hyperexcitability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS] is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder of motor neurons, heralded by the development of cortical hyperexcitability. Reduction of short interval intracortical inhibition [SICI] in ALS, a feature linked to the development of cortical hyperexcitability, may be mediated by degeneration of inhibitory circuits or alternatively activation of high threshold excitatory circuits. As such, determining the mechanisms of SICI reduction in ALS has clear diagnostic and therapeutic significance. Consequently, the present study utilized a novel threshold tracking paired-pulse paradigm to determine whether SICI reduction in ALS represented reduced inhibition or excessive excitation. Using a 90 mm circular coil, SICI was assessed at three different conditioning stimulus intensities: 40%, 70% and 90% of resting motor threshold [RMT]. Motor evoked potential responses were recorded over the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. Short interval intracortical inhibition was uniformly reduced across all three levels of conditioning intensities in ALS [40% RMT, ALS -0.6+/-0.7%, controls 2.0+/-0.6%, P<0.01; 70% RMT, ALS 0.6+/-2.7%, controls 12.8+/-2%, P<0.001; 90% RMT, ALS -15.9+/-1.3%, controls 2.2+/-4.1%, P<0.01]. In addition, the resting motor threshold was reduced, while the motor evoked potential amplitude was increased in ALS patients, in keeping with cortical hyperexcitability. These findings establish that SICI reduction in ALS represents degeneration of inhibitory cortical circuits, combined with excessive excitation of high threshold excitatory pathways. Neuroprotective strategies aimed at preserving the integrity of intracortical inhibitory circuits, in addition to antagonizing excitatory cortical circuits, may provide novel therapeutic targets in ALS.",Excluded

In early-stage disease, FDG is often better concentrated in tumor sites than MIBG.

Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from gastrocnemius-soleus.

She presented in April 2016 with sudden onset severe pelvic pain and stiffness, which within days rendered her immobile. The symptoms had been preceded by mild flu like illness. Clinically she had no systemic features but on examination demonstrated significant bilateral pelvic girdle weakness and pain. There was no distal neurological deficit and no clinical findings suggesting an SLE flare. Working diagnosis was of myositis, possibly secondary to SLE. Method(s): Serology showed an acute phase response (CRP 298), normal CK, complement levels, ANA and dsDNA. Renal function was normal and there was no evidence of lupus nephritis. Within a week of admission she underwent a pelvic MRI (with STIR), which showed florid inflammation within the muscles of her pelvis. When compared to the map of her radiotherapy treatment, the area almost exactly matched. This changed her working diagnosis to include delayed onset radiotherapy-induced myositis. Result(s): Her inflammatory markers remained markedly elevated (CRP >250). She was due to start high dose steroids for treatment of myositis to cover any potential inflammatory component, in the knowledge that evidence for steroid use and success in radiation induced myositis was sparse and had modest success at best. Incidentally she was found to have intermittent genito-urinary symptoms over the preceding 4-5 months, including dyspareunia and intermittent purulent discharge. She had no other signs to suggest sepsis and observations were all normal. A high vaginal swab grew Group G streptococcus, which, following extensive gynaecology review investigation was subsequently found to be due to a small abscess inside the vagina. It was not amenable to surgical drainage and was treated conservatively with antibiotics. Within 2 weeks of antibiotics therapy, analgesia and physiotherapy for her reduced mobility, her inflammatory markers improved and her pain started to improve. She underwent an open muscle biopsy under GA which was inconclusive. Antibiotics were continued and after 3 weeks of inpatient IV treatment her inflammatory markers showed a dramatic improvement. Her pain gradually improved along with it, as did her mobility. Conclusion(s): She was discharged from hospital with a prolonged course of antibiotics and continues to make great progress. Steroids treatment is still on hold until infection cleared and recovery of function established. It remains to be seen if indeed the area of inflammation actually represents anything other than infection induced myositis.",Excluded

4281,"GABA-enhanced collective behavior in neuronal axons underlies persistent gamma-frequency oscillations Gamma (30-80 Hz) oscillations occur in mammalian electroencephalogram in a manner that indicates cognitive relevance. In vitro models of gamma oscillations demonstrate two forms of oscillation: one occurring transiently and driven by discrete afferent input and the second occurring persistently in response to activation of excitatory metabotropic receptors. The mechanism underlying persistent gamma oscillations has been suggested to involve gap-junctional communication between axons of principal neurons, but the precise relationship between this neuronal activity and the gamma oscillation has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that gamma oscillations coexist with high-frequency oscillations (>90 Hz). High-frequency oscillations can be generated in the axonal plexus even when it is physically isolated from pyramidal cell bodies. They were enhanced in networks by nonsomatic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<inf>A</inf>) receptor activation, were modulated by perisomatic GABA<inf>A</inf> receptor-mediated synaptic input to principal cells, and provided the phasic input to interneurons required to generate persistent gamma-frequency oscillations.

As such, CBCT has become very useful for the pre-op work-up of patients with cholesteatoma showing with precision bony erosion of the ossicular chain and erosion of the petrous bone (as fistulae, perilabyrinthine erosion, intracranial invasion). Also the aeration of theME-cleft is shown (important for the functional prognosis) and important preoperative landmarks warn the surgeon for eventual pitfalls. The advent of the non-EP diffusion weighted sequence in MR-imaging makes this sequence a very useful adjunctive tool in the pre-op work-up of cholesteatoma cases specially in cases suspected of intralabyrinthine spread, or extension medial to the otic capsule or intracranial invasion. Its today almost undisputed value has been demonstrated in the postoperative follow-up of cholesteatoma by the high sensitivity and specificity (in most studies well above 90%). By this innovation many ""unnecessary"" (because absence of residual pathology) second stage operations can today be avoided. Advantages and limitations of the two imaging techniques will be discussed. An algorithm usefull in clinical practice will be proposed.",Excluded
4596,"Antegrade transapical branched aortic arch endograft-a feasibility study in pigs Background: To describe the technique and proof the concept of a complete transapical deployment of a single sidebranch arch endograft in a porcine model. Method(s): Eight domestic pigs were operated with antegrade transapical delivery of a single-sidebranch arch endograft including a mating stentgraft to the innominate artery. Technical feasibility, operating time, radiation parameters and hemodynamic changes were studied according to standardized protocol during baseline (T0), after establishing of the transapical access and through-and-through wire (T1) and after stent-graft deployment (T2). Myocardial and cerebral perfusion were assessed by fluorescent-microspheres (FM) and transit-time-flow measurement (TTFM). Result(s): Transapical access, introduction and deployment of the endograft, sidebranch catheterization and deployment of the mating stent-graft were feasible in 6 of the 8 animals with unimpeded perfusion of the innominate artery. One animal was lost during transapical access, one during sire-branch catheterization. The mean operating and fluoroscopy times were 157+/-47min and 15.9+/-3.2min. During introduction and deployment of the stent-graft transient aortic valve insufficiency occurred in all animals. Hemodynamic stability recovered within ten minutes after retrieval of the delivery system in all animals. The innominate artery was patent with unchanged TTFM-flow measurements throughout the procedure. FM evaluation revealed stable myocardial and cerebral perfusion. Conclusion(s): Antegrade transapical access to the aortic arch for implantation of a single sidebranch arch endograft is feasible in a porcine model with reversible impact on hemodynamic measures during deployment. Transapical access allows for deployment of a complex endograft through a single large bore access-site in a porcine model. It might be a future treatment option for selective patients.",Excluded

A. calamus extract (250 mg/kg body weight) was orally administered to mice 1 h prior to whole body gamma-radiation exposure. The antioxidant levels in the tissue homogenates of brain, liver and kidney of the irradiated mice were determined and cellular DNA damage was monitored by comet assay. Effect of administration of the extract on survival of the animals exposed to acute lethal dose of 10 Gy whole body gamma-radiations was also monitored. Administration of the extract significantly increased the activities of major enzymes of the antioxidant defense system specially SOD, catalase and GPx and levels of GSH in 2, 6 and 10 Gy irradiated mice and decreased the formation MDA. The extract also decreased DNA strand breaks. The survival rate was found to be increased up to 5%.

3770,"Relationship between histologic features and outcomes of carotid revascularization for radiation-induced stenosis OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate the relationships between preoperative carotid imaging results, histologic characteristics, and surgical treatment outcomes of radiation-induced carotid stenosis (RICS), using control subjects without RICS for comparison.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of 17 patients who underwent carotid revascularization for 22 instances of RICS, including 10 cases of carotid artery stenting (CAS), 11 cases of carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and 1 case of CEA with retrograde CAS, between July 2004 and April 2013. The controls were 475 patients with no history of radiation therapy who underwent carotid revascularization in a similar period. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (US), and computed tomography angiography results were correlated with outcomes of histologic analysis of CEA specimens. End points included ipsilateral and contralateral stroke, myocardial infarction, restenosis, in-stent thrombosis, and target lesion revascularization.RESULTS: Vulnerable plaques on carotid MRI (86% vs 64.2%; P = .010) and mobile (27% vs 8.0%; P = .008) and ulcerative (50% vs 15.8%; P < .001) plaques on US were more frequent in the RICS group. All revascularization procedures were successful, and no occlusion occurred. Adverse events in the CAS group, including one minor stroke and one transient ischemic attack within 30 days as well as five ipsilateral neurologic events after 30 days, including three minor strokes and two transient ischemic attacks, were significantly more frequent than in the CEA group. All three cases of late ipsilateral stroke displayed vulnerable plaque on preoperative MRI and late in-stent thrombosis or restenosis on US.CONCLUSIONS: Our radiologic and histologic analyses revealed that advanced RICS is often accompanied by formation of vulnerable plaque. CEA can prevent undesirable late outcomes in such cases.",Included
3814,"Expert opinion paper on cardiac imaging after ischemic stroke This expert opinion paper on cardiac imaging after acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) includes a statement of the ""Heart and Brain"" consortium of the German Cardiac Society and the German Stroke Society. The Stroke Unit-Commission of the German Stroke Society and the German Atrial Fibrillation NETwork (AFNET) endorsed this paper. Cardiac imaging is a key component of etiological work-up after stroke. Enhanced echocardiographic tools, constantly improving cardiac computer tomography (CT) as well as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer comprehensive non- or less-invasive cardiac evaluation at the expense of increased costs and/or radiation exposure. Certain imaging findings usually lead to a change in medical secondary stroke prevention or may influence medical treatment. However, there is no proof from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that the choice of the imaging method influences the prognosis of stroke patients. Summarizing present knowledge, the German Heart and Brain consortium proposes an interdisciplinary, staged standard diagnostic scheme for the detection of risk factors of cardio-embolic stroke. This expert opinion paper aims to give practical advice to physicians who are involved in stroke care. In line with the nature of an expert opinion paper, labeling of classes of recommendations is not provided, since many statements are based on expert opinion, reported case series, and clinical experience.",Excluded
3720,"Prevalence of abnormal brain CT scan finding in patients with headache: Two year study in Imam Hospital. [Arabic] Background: Headache is one of the most common problems that bring patients to doctors' offices. Many physicians order neuroimaging studies after taking the history of the patient and performing a physical examination. These neuroimaging studies are often requested due to the probable existence of an intracranial lesion. However, at times they are requested to allay the fears of patients or even doctors. Most of these studies are normal and the question arises whether there is any indication for requesting neuroimaging studies for a patient with an isolated headache. Method(s): We studied 146 patients with headache who had been referred for CT scan to the imaging center of Imam Khomeini Hospital during 2004-2005. For each patient, a questionnaire, including the medical history and accompanying neurological symptoms, was filled out and CT scan results were gathered. Result(s): The mean of age of the patients was 37.8 years, and 69% were female. Only 10 patients (6.8%) had a brain lesion in the CT scan. Accompanying neurological symptoms were more frequent in patients with abnormal rather than normal CT scans. There was a meaningful correlation between abnormal CT scan and paresthesia, ptosis, paresia, diplopia, visual loss, convulsion, vomiting and vertigo. A statistical correlation existed between gender and positive CT scan. Conclusion(s): Many patients with headache have normal brain CT scan results. Thus, better criteria are warranted for requesting neuroimaging including accurate patient history and neurological examination in order to prevent unnecessary radiation exposure. MRI instead of Cr scan would be a better first step toward the evaluation of the possible existence of brain lesions.",Excluded
4617,"Spinal ependymoma in adults: Diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy Introduction: Due to a relative low incidence of spinal ependymomas in adults, a definitive therapeutic strategy is still missing. Therefore, different concepts are under discussion without a uniform standard of therapy and diagnostics. Material(s) and Method(s): We evaluated all spinal ependymomas treated surgically from 03/2006 until 05/2012 at our department. This consecutive, retrospective series includes 41 patients: 23 female, 18 male, median age 51 y. (range 21-80). 22 Ependymomas were located intramedullary, 18 within cauda equina or filum terminale, 1 patient presented with multifocal spinal lesions including both, intramedullar and extramedullar lesions. Perioperative standard diagnostic of most tumors included a holospinal MRI and a CSF cytology. First follow-up MRI and exam was done 3 months postoperatively, further controls every year in case of stable findings. Current median follow-up is 29 months (range 3-72). Preoperative, early postoperative and follow-up clinical performance was evaluated according to the modified McCormick scale. Postoperative deterioration was dichotomized in ""slight"" (=deterioration without any increase of the modified McCormick scale grades or an increase in only one grade within the scale range 1-2) and ""significant"" (=increase to grade 7ge;3 on the modified McCormick scale). Result(s): Preoperatively, the vast majority presented neurologically intact or with mild deficits maintaining functional independence according to the modified McCormick scale. The most common preoperative symptom was pain (78%), followed by sensory deficits (54%), gait ataxia (34%), motor deficits (27%), and bowel/bladder dysfunction (12%). In only one patient the ependymoma was found incidentally. Gross total resection (GTR) could be achieved in 85% (n=35) (subtotal resection n=5, debulking of the main tumor mass of a multifocal disease n=1). Histology: the majority were WHO IIdegree (n=30), 10 WHOdegreeI tumours, 1 case of anaplastic ependymoma WHOdegreeIII. Immediately after surgery 24% (n=10) showed worsening of neurological symptoms, but in most cases only mild new deficits occurred. During follow up 78% (n=32) showed at least preop status, 37% (n=15) improved. In only 5% (n=2) a permanent significant deterioration remained. Adjuvant radiotherapy was performed after the first surgery in two cases: in one patient with drop metastasis after the GTR of the main tumour, and in another patient with multifocal lesions after debulking, both were WHOdegreeII ependymomas. Tumour recurrence was seen in 4 cases, so far: 3 WHOdegreeII, 1 WHOdegreeI, 2 of them despite previous GTR and 1 despite adjuvant radiation. Median progression free survival was 22 months (range 6-43). 2 patients died of meningeosis 19 and 31 months after the initial diagnosis, respectively. Conclusion(s): Gross-total resection still stays the main column of ependymoma therapy. In our series this could be achieved in 85% accompanied by a rate of 5% for significant persistent deficits. In cases of incomplete resection stereotactic radiotherapy as well as a wait and see srategy can be considered. In case of disseminated disease holospinal radiation with a boost to the primary tumour site is recommended. Due to the risk of recurrence, close follow up with clinical and imaging examinations are mandatory.",Excluded
4654,"Amyloid fibril formation of alpha-synuclein is accelerated by preformed amyloid seeds of other proteins: implications for the mechanism of transmissible conformational diseases Alpha-synuclein is one of the causative proteins of familial Parkinson disease, which is characterized by neuronal inclusions named Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies include not only alpha-synuclein but also aggregates of other proteins. This fact raises a question as to whether the formation of alpha-synuclein amyloid fibrils in Lewy bodies may occur via interaction with fibrils derived from different proteins. To probe this hypothesis, we investigated in vitro fibril formation of human alpha-synuclein in the presence of preformed fibril seeds of various different proteins. We used three proteins, Escherichia coli chaperonin GroES, hen lysozyme, and bovine insulin, all of which have been shown to form amyloid fibrils. Very surprisingly, the formation of alpha-synuclein amyloid fibril was accelerated markedly in the presence of preformed seeds of GroES, lysozyme, and insulin fibrils. The structural characteristics of the natively unfolded state of alpha-synuclein may allow binding to various protein particles, which in turn triggers the formation (extension) of alpha-synuclein amyloid fibrils. This finding is very important for understanding the molecular mechanism of Parkinson disease and also provides interesting implications into the mechanism of transmissible conformational diseases.",Excluded
4781,"Performance of long rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator PET detectors PURPOSE: High-sensitivity and high-resolution depth-encoding positron emission tomography (PET) detectors are required to simultaneously improve the sensitivity and spatial resolution of a PET scanner so that the quantitative accuracy of PET studies can be improved. The semi-monolithic scintillator PET detector has the advantage of measuring the depth of interaction with single-ended readout as compared to the traditional pixelated scintillator detector, and significantly reducing the edge effect that deteriorates the spatial resolution at edges of the detector as compared to the monolithic scintillator detector if a long rectangular semi-monolithic detector is used. In this work, depth-encoding PET detector modules were built by using long rectangular semi-monolithic scintillators and single-ended readout by silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays. The performance of the detector modules was measured.METHODS: The rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator detector has an outside dimension of 11.6 x 37.6 x 10 mm<sup>3</sup> and consists of 11 polished lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) slices measuring 1 x 37.6 x 10 mm<sup>3</sup> . The enhanced specular reflector (ESR) was glued on both cross-sectional surfaces of each crystal slice. For the face opposite to the SiPM array and the two end faces of the detectors, surface treatments with and without black paint were implemented for performance comparison. The bottom face of the semi-monolithic detector was coupled to a 4 x 12 SiPM array that was grouped along rows and columns separately into 16 signals. The four row signals were used to identify the slices, and the 12 column signals were used to estimate the y (monolithic direction) and z (depth direction) interaction positions. The detector was irradiated at multiple positions with a collimated 511 keV gamma beam. The collimated beam was obtained with electronic collimation by using a <sup>22</sup> Na point source and a reference detector. The estimated width of the gamma beam is around 0.5 mm. The flood histogram for crystal slices was measured by using the center of gravity (COG) method. The COG method and the squared COG method were used for y position estimation. The standard deviation of the column signals, the ratio of maximum to the sum of the column signals, and the sum of squared column signals were used for z position estimation.RESULTS: All slices were clearly resolved from the measured flood histograms for both detectors with different crystal surface treatments. The estimated y positions roughly linearly change with the true positions at the middle of the detector until ~5 mm from both ends of the detector. The y and z spatial resolutions of the detectors were estimated for all middle positions located more than 5 mm from both ends of the detector. The squared COG method provides better y position resolution than the COG method. The three z estimation methods provide similar depth of interaction (DOI) resolution. Surface treatment with black paint significantly improves both y and z position resolution but degrades the energy and timing resolution of the detectors. The average full width half maxima (FWHM) spatial resolution is improved from 1.77 to 1.07 mm in the y direction by using the squared COG method and from 2.71 to 1.55 mm in the z direction by using the standard deviation method. The slice-based average energy resolution degrades from 15.8% to 24.9%. The timing resolution of the entire detector module degrades from 596 to 788 ps.CONCLUSION: The performance of rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator PET detectors with two different crystal surface treatments was measured. The detectors provide superior spatial resolution and depth-encoding capability and can be used to develop small animal and dedicated breast and brain PET scanners that can simultaneously achieve high spatial resolution, high sensitivity, and low cost.",Excluded

4812,"Auditory efferent feedback system deficits precede age-related hearing loss: contralateral suppression of otoacoustic emissions in mice The C57BL/6J mouse has been a useful model of presbycusis, as it displays an accelerated age-related peripheral hearing loss. The medial olivocochlear efferent feedback (MOC) system plays a role in suppressing cochlear outer hair cell (OHC) responses, particularly for background noise. Neurons of the MOC system are located in the superior olivary complex, particularly in the dorsomedial periolivary nucleus (DMPO) and in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB). We previously discovered that the function of the MOC system declines with age prior to OHC degeneration, as measured by contralateral suppression (CS) of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in humans and CBA mice. The present study aimed to determine the time course of age changes in MOC function in C57s. DPOAE amplitudes and CS of DPOAEs were collected for C57s from 6 to 40 weeks of age. MOC responses were observed at 6 weeks but were gone at middle (15-30 kHz) and high (30-45 kHz) frequencies by 8 weeks. Quantitative stereological analyses of Nissl sections revealed smaller neurons in the DMPO and VNTB of young adult C57s compared with CBAs. These findings suggest that reduced neuron size may underlie part of the noteworthy rapid decline of the C57 efferent system. In conclusion, the C57 mouse has MOC function at 6 weeks, but it declines quickly, preceding the progression of peripheral age-related sensitivity deficits and hearing loss in this mouse strain.",Excluded

4073,"Long-Term Outcomes and Patterns of Failure After Surgical Resection of Small-Cell Lung Cancer Background The role of surgical resection as a treatment option for early-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is controversial, and few data exist regarding the patterns of treatment failure in these patients. Patients and Methods The medical records of all patients receiving definitive surgical management of SCLC at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) from January 1, 1985 to December 31, 2012 were reviewed. Estimates of survival and recurrence risk were recorded using the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparative analyses were performed with Cox regression analysis. Results A total of 54 patients were identified. The median follow-up period was 5.9 years. At 5 years, overall survival was 37% and recurrence-free survival 44%. Intrathoracic recurrence, the most frequent treatment failure, occurred in 14 patients, with an estimated intrathoracic recurrence-free survival at 3 years of 64.4%. Patients undergoing wedge resection or segmentectomy, rather than lobectomy or pneumonectomy, had an increased risk of intrathoracic recurrence (hazard ratio, 3.5; P =.01). Overall survival was improved at 5 years after lobectomy or pneumonectomy compared with wedge resection or segmentectomy (48% vs. 15%, respectively; P =.03). Conclusion Surgical resection of SCLC can achieve reasonable treatment outcomes and can be considered for well-selected patients with clinical early-stage disease. Intrathoracic recurrence is the most common site of treatment failure. Caution should be taken with patients who are unable to tolerate at least lobectomy, because they are at a high risk of local recurrence. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4394,"Continuous theta-burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex inhibits improvement on a working memory task Theta-burst stimulation (TBS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) may be more effective for modulating cortical excitability compared to standard repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, the impact of intermittent (iTBS) and continuous TBS (cTBS) on working memory (WM) is poorly studied. The aim of our study was to compare the effects of iTBS and cTBS on WM over the left and right DLPFC. iTBS, cTBS or sham stimulation was administered over the right and left hemisphere of fifty-one healthy human subjects. WM was assessed before and after TBS using the 1-back, 2-back, and 3-back tasks. We found classical practice effects in the iTBS and the sham group: WM performance improved following stimulation as measured by the discriminability index. However, this effect could not be observed in the cTBS group. We did not find any hemisphere-dependent effects, suggesting that the practice effect is not lateralized, and TBS affects WM performance in a comparable manner if administered either over the left or the right hemisphere. We propose that our findings represent a useful addition to the literature of TBS-induced effects on WM. Moreover, these results indicate the possibility of clarifying processes underlying WM performance changes by using non-invasive brain stimulation.",Excluded
4650,"FDTD analysis of a noninvasive hyperthermia system for brain tumors Hyperthermia is considered one of the new therapeutic modalities for cancer treatment and is based on the difference in thermal sensitivity between healthy tissues and tumors. During hyperthermia treatment, the temperature of the tumor is raised to 40-45degreeC for a definite period resulting in the destruction of cancer cells. This paper investigates design, modeling and simulation of a new non-invasive hyperthermia applicator system capable of effectively heating deep seated as well as superficial brain tumors using inexpensive, simple, and easy to fabricate components without harming surrounding healthy brain tissues. The proposed hyperthermia applicator system is composed of an air filled partial half ellipsoidal chamber, a patch antenna, and a head model with an embedded tumor at an arbitrary location. The irradiating antenna is placed at one of the foci of the hyperthermia chamber while the center of the brain tumor is placed at the other focus. The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method is used to compute both the SAR patterns and the temperature distribution in three different head models due to two different patch antennas at a frequency of 915 MHz. The obtained results suggest that by using the proposed noninvasive hyperthermia system it is feasible to achieve sufficient and focused energy deposition and temperature rise to therapeutic values in deep seated as well as superficial brain tumors without harming surrounding healthy tissue. The proposed noninvasive hyperthermia system proved suitable for raising the temperature in tumors embedded in the brain to therapeutic values by carefully selecting the systems components. The operator of the system only needs to place the center of the brain tumor at a pre-specified location and excite the antenna at a single frequency of 915 MHz.

3969,"A method for recording miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the central nervous system suitable for quantal analysis Quantal analysis of transmitter release is useful in examining presynaptic mechanisms involved in synaptic transmission. However, in central neurons, the presence of multiple synapses makes it difficult to use the traditional quantal analysis, developed for the neuromuscular transmission. We developed a method to minimize these difficulties. Experiments were performed, using the whole-cell patch-clamp recording technique, on rat CA1 pyramidal neurons in a hippocampal slice preparation. When the stratum radiatum was stimulated, mixed current signals including, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) and evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs), could be observed in CA1 pyramidal cells while slices were superfused with the normal, Na(+)-containing, medium. The mIPSCs could be blocked by bicuculline (10 microm). mEPSCs, eEPSCs and eIPSCs could not be observed when the Na(+)-containing perfusion medium was replaced by a Na(+)-free medium but reappeared when the Na(+)-containing medium was re-introduced. When a polarizing electrode was placed near the recorded neuron, while slices were superfused with the Na(+)-free medium, and depolarizing rectangular current pulses of different magnitudes were applied, the number of mIPSCs increased with increasing amount of the current. Amplitudes of the mIPSCs showed a Gaussian distribution and the coefficient of variation was small. These observations indicate that a combination of the Na(+)-free superfusing medium and local depolarizations with a polarizing electrode is useful for recording mIPSCs from a localized area of the recorded neuron and for quantal analysis.",Excluded
4523,"Inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase as a protective effect of nicaraven in ionizing radiation- and ara-C-induced cell death BACKGROUND: Nicaraven is a drug used for patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. It crosses the blood-brain barrier and has potent antivasospastic and brain-protective effects. While nicaraven scavenges the hydroxyl radical, the mechanism of its protection remains obscure. In addition to the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect, nicaraven also exhibits inhibitory action on poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The mechanism of the pharmacological action of nicaraven has not yet been clarified.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human myeloid HL-525 cells were exposed to ionizing radiation or hydrogen peroxide and the effect of nicaraven on the activation of the Egr-1 promoter was measured. Next, the action of the drug on DNA fragmentation and inhibition of thymidine uptake caused by the genotoxic stimulation of ionizing radiation or cytosine B-D-arabinofuranoside (ara-C) were assessed. Finally, direct inhibition of the PARP enzyme by nicaraven was measured.RESULTS: Nicaraven did not inhibit the activation of the Egr-1 promoter caused by H2O2 and the activation caused by ionizing radiation. However, the drug repressed DNA fragmentation and increased thymidine uptake dose-dependently. Nicaraven had a direct inhibitory effect on PARP.DISCUSSION: The effect of nicaraven on the Egr-1 promoter was different from that of another free-radical scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine. Nicaraven demonstrated similar protection of the PARP inhibitors including 3-aminobenzamide. Since nicaraven directly inhibits the PARP enzyme, the drug might be useful in oncology as well as in studying tissue-damaging conditions characterized by increased PARP activity.",Excluded

A group of combined surgery (removal of an AVM with preoperative embolization) consisted of 40 patients, and a group of combined radiotherapy (radiation after partial embolization or partial removal of an AVM) included 53 patients. 36 patients underwent radiosurgery, and 17 patients received stereotactic radiation therapy. Both groups were analyzed in terms of outcomes, complications, and follow-up results.RESULTS: In the group of combined surgery, according to the Glasgow outcome scale, good results (grade 4-5) were achieved in 35 (87.5%) patients at discharge and in 27 (90%) patients during follow-up. Treatment outcomes, surgery duration, and the amount of blood loss were not significantly different from those in the control group. Complete AVM obliteration was achieved in 29 (80.6%) patients 3 years after radiosurgery and in 8 (47%) patients after stereotactic radiotherapy. In discussion, these findings are compared to the published data, and recommendations for AVM treatment are suggested.CONCLUSION: The combined treatment of AVMs is effective management for patients with complex AVMs (Spetzler-Martin grade III-IV AVMs). Successful treatment of AVMs requires careful planning and teamwork of vascular and endovascular neurosurgeons, radiologists, and neurologists.",Excluded
4790,"[Relationship between simulated weightlessness-induced muscle spindle change and muscle atrophy] One of the most important and urgent issues in the field of space medicine is to reveal the potential mechanism underlying the disused muscle atrophy during the weightlessness or microgravity environment. It will conduce to find out effective methods for the prevention and treatment of muscle atrophy during a long-term space flight. Increasing data show that muscle spindle discharges are significantly altered following the hindlimb unloading, suggesting a vital role in the progress of muscle atrophy. In the last decades, we have made a series of studies on changes in the morphological structure and function of muscle spindle following simulated weightlessness. This review will discuss our main results and related researches for understanding of muscle spindle activities during microgravity environment, which may provide a theoretic basis for effective prevention and treatment of muscle atrophy induced by weightlessness.",Excluded
4481,"The capabilities and characteristics of helical tomotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc therapy in sparing the hippocampus during prophylactic cranial irradiation Purpose: To investigate the capabilities and characteristics of helical tomotherapy (HT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in sparing the Bilateral hippocampal tissues (BHT) during prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Method(s): HT and VMAT treatment plans were generated with a prescription dose of 30Gy/10 fractions in 16 patients treated with PCI. The dosimetry parameters of BHT, organs at risk (OARs), and planning target volume (PTV) were determined when the average dose of BHT was reduced by about 4Gy to serve as an observation point. Statistical plots were used to present dosimetry changing trends when sparing the BHT with both HT and VMAT technologies. Result(s): HT plans spared BHT V7.3Gy by up to 40%, with the average Dmean-BHT = 8.42+/-0.41Gy, while VMAT plans failed to spare BHT V7.3Gy by such an amount. HT authored significantly lower doses to OARs, including Dmean-BHT (HT 16.37Gy vs. VMAT 17.81Gy, P=0.03), Dmean-inner ear (P=0.02), Dmean-parotid glands (P=0.02), Dmax-lens (P=0.02), and Dmax-brainstem (P=0.02), except for Dmax-optic nerves (P=0.87), compared to VMAT. Also, compared to VMAT, HT plans provided better target coverage, with lower average D2% (P=0.02), higher average D98% (P=0.02), and better conformal index (0.87 vs. 0.84, P=0.02) and homogeneity index (0.15 vs. 0.21, P=0.05). With smaller BHT doses, the dose distribution to PTV occurred in three dosimetry regions for both HT and VMAT plans; the plateau region (>20.0Gy for HT vs >16.0Gy for VMAT), gradient region (20.0-12.0Gy vs 16.0-11.0Gy), and falling region (<12.0Gy vs <11.0Gy). The average delivery duration for HT was determined at almost 7.7 times longer than VMAT. Conclusion(s): Compared to VMAT, HT was better at sparing the BHT and OARs and had better target coverage but much longer treatment duration. More BHT dose decreases would yield worse target dose coverage, which would present a 'three regions' stair-stepping characteristic.",Excluded
4253,"Combining low-dose whole brain radiation with radioimmunotherapy for primary central nervous system lymphoma Purpose/Objective(s): Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive B-cell disorder that initially responds well to therapy, but a majority of patients relapse within 2 years. High-dose whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) was once the primary treatment, but eventual relapses and late neurocognitive sequelae were frequently observed. The addition of CNS-directed chemotherapy to WBRT improved duration of response, with a concomitant increase in neurocognitive problems. More recently, medical oncologists have attempted to avoid radiation altogether, with similar clinical responses as seen with WBRT alone. The addition of rituximab has yielded little improvement due to the poor efficiency (<1%) of the antibody to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). WBRT has been shown to temporarily disrupt the BBB permeability to macromolecules for several hours.We hypothesized that adjuvant low-dose WBRT followed by anti-CD20-directed radioimmunotherapy (RIT) may allow for specific dose escalation to areas of tumor cells while avoiding extra dose to uninvolved areas of the brain, decreasing the chance for significant neurocognitive deficits. Materials/Methods: Four patients (71F, 69M, 48F, 53M) with PCNSL (3 relapsed, 1 newly diagnosed) were treated with low-dose (18 Gy in 10 fractions) WBRT,with 90Yibritumomab tiuxetan RIT given immediately after the final WBRT fraction. None of the patients had previously received radiation therapy.Median RIT dosewas 24.5 (21.8-32) mCi. All patients were restaged with contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain at 3 months, and every 3 months following. At baseline and at each follow-up visit, neurocognition was tested and family members were asked about subjective changes. Result(s): All four patients obtained a complete response to chemotherapy + low-dose WBRT + RIT. After a median follow-up of 17.5 (12-20) months, no relapses have been observed. No decline in neurocognitive function (objective or subjective) has been seen; in fact, improvement was seen in 3 patients. All patients tolerated the regimen well, with the typical transient decline and recovery of blood counts seen with RIT. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant low-dose WBRT and RIT following CNS-directed chemotherapy appears to be safe in this small sample. Complete responses were seen in all patients, and this appears to be durable compared to standard PCNSL salvage therapies. No neurocognitive deficits were seen following this novel radiation therapy regimen. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.",Excluded
4675,"Distinguishing glioma recurrence from treatment effect after radiochemotherapy and immunotherapy Recent advancements have made radiation and chemotherapy the standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastomas. The use of these therapies has resulted in an increased diagnosis of pseudoprogression and radiation-induced necrosis. Standard MRI techniques are inadequate in differentiating tumor recurrence from posttreatment effects. Diagnosis of a posttreatment lesion as glioma recurrence rather than radiochemotherapy or immunotherapy treatment effect is critical. This increase in accuracy plays a role as newer immunotherapies incurring posttreatment effects on MRI emerge. Advancements with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging, and functional positron emission tomography scans have shown promising capabilities. Further investigations are necessary to assess the imaging algorithms and accuracy of these modalities to differentiate true glioma recurrence from radiotherapy or immunotherapy treatment effect.

3946,"Immune responses in the draining lymph nodes against cancer: Implications for immunotherapy Regional lymph nodes are the first site for melanoma metastases. The sentinel node (SN), on the direct lymphatic drainage pathway, which usually harbors first metastases, demonstrates significant suppression in its ability to respond to antigenic stimulation. This down-regulation of SN immunity is likely the basis of its susceptibility to tumor metastases, suggesting a potential role of the immune system in the control of malignant tumors. Despite immune dysfunction in the SN, phase II trials of systemic post-operative immunotherapy with a polyvalent melanoma vaccine developed at the John Wayne Cancer Institute showed improved 5-year overall survival in patients with melanoma metastatic to regional nodes. However, most immunotherapy clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a significant clinical response, and analyses of immune responses to tumor-associated antigens that correlate clinical responses have not been established. Therefore, refinements in assay methodologies and improvements in vaccine designs are critical to the success of cancer immunotherapy. Antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) is the most potent means to initiate a T cell immunity. Dendritic cell-based immunotherapies have been vigorously attempted in the past decade. To improve the immunogenicity of cancer vaccines, we recently generated heterokaryons of DCs and tumor cells by electrofusion. The fusion hybrids retained their full antigen-presenting capacity and all natural tumor antigens. In pre-clinical animal experiments, a single injection of the DC-tumor fusion hybrids was sufficient to mediate the regression of tumors established in the lung, skin and brain. Most interestingly, successful therapy required the delivery of fusion hybrids directly into lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes. A clinical trial is now being carried out to test the immunogenicity and therapeutic effects of fusion hybrids for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

4670,"Radiotherapy of brain metastases in lung cancer UNLABELLED: Therapeutical approach in brain metastases still remains the major problem in many cancer patients, especially in those with primary lung lesion. The aim of the present study was to test the tolerance to a whole brain telegammatherapy with a daily dose of 2 Gy in patients with lung cancer, to evaluate the improvement of sensory and motor deficits, and to define the more appropriate total dose (20 or 30 Gy) with regard to the patient survival.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty nine patients with lung cancer and verified brain metastases underwent a whole brain telegammatherapy to a total dose of 20-30 Gy. Solitary metastases were found in 45 percent of the patients but all were defined as inoperable cases. The other patients had two or more brain lesions.RESULTS: All patients tolerated well the fraction and the total dose. The mean survival of the patients was 6.6 months with confidence interval 5.8-7.4 months. The survival difference between treatments with 20 and 30 Gy total dose did not reach statistical significance. Significant improvement was found in the Karnofsky index, intracranial pressure, headache, and neurologic symptoms after radiotherapy.CONCLUSION: Radiation therapy in patients with brain metastases from lung cancer is well tolerated and improves the quality of life.",Excluded
3702,"Dual role of MRK in glioblastoma invasion and radio-resistance Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive tumor of the central nervous system, has poor prognosis both because of diffuse infiltration of tumor cells in the normal parenchyma and resistance to radiation treatment and chemotherapy. We found that MRK, a stress-activated MAP3K protein kinase, is overexpressed in GBM compared with normal brain tissue, evident in microarray expression data and confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. We have shown that MRK can be activated by at least two distinct signaling inputs: MRK kinase activity is stimulated by ionizing radiation (IR) downstream of NBS1 and ATM in a pathway that leads to activation of Chk2 and cell-cycle arrest. We also showed that downregulation of MRK by RNA interference sensitizes SNB19 and U87 GBM cells to IR. In addition, MRK functions as an effector of RhoC in a pathway that is initiated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a motogenic factor that is overproduced in GBM tumors. We also showed that MRK depletion impairs LPA-stimulated invasion in GBM cells. To examine the role of MRK in GBM in vivo, we used an orthotopic xenograft model. Human GBM explant cells (GBM6) were maintained in nude mice as flank tumors, transduced in vitro with lentiviruses expressing control or MRK shRNA, and subsequently implanted into the brains of nude mice. Control mice had a median survival of 47 days, whereas downregulation of MRK increased survival by 14 days. In a parallel experiment, mice were treated with 20-Gy radiation in 10 fractions over 5 days. This radiation treatment on its own increased survival by only 7 days; in contrast, downregulation of MRK had a strongly synergistic effect, extending survival by more than 35 days. In conclusion, these data validate MRK as a novel target for GBM therapy.",Excluded
4323,"Cranial diameter pulsations measured by non-invasive ultrasound decrease with tilt INTRODUCTION: Intracranial pressure (ICP) may play a significant role in physiological responses to microgravity by contributing to the nausea associated with microgravity exposure. However, effects of altered gravity on ICP in astronauts have not been investigated, primarily due to the invasiveness of currently available techniques. We have developed an ultrasonic device that monitors changes in cranial diameter pulsation non-invasively so that we can evaluate ICP dynamics in astronauts during spaceflight. This study was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of our ultrasound technique under the physiological condition in which ICP dynamics are changed due to altered gravitational force.METHODS: Six healthy volunteers were placed at 60 degrees head-up, 30 degrees headup, supine, and 15 degrees head-down positions for 3 min at each angle. We measured arterial blood pressure (ABP) with a finger pressure cuff, and cranial diameter pulsation with a pulsed phase lock loop device (PPLL).RESULTS: Analysis of covariance demonstrated that amplitudes of cranial diameter pulsations were significantly altered with the angle of tilt (p < 0.001). The 95% confidence interval for linear regression coefficients of the cranial diameter pulsation amplitudes with tilt angle was 0.862 to 0.968. However, ABP amplitudes did not show this relationship.DISCUSSION: Our noninvasive ultrasonic technique reveals that the amplitude of cranial diameter pulsation decreases as a function of tilt angle, suggesting that ICP pulsation follows the same relationship. It is demonstrated that the PPLL device has a sufficient sensitivity to detect changes non-invasively in ICP pulsation caused by altered gravity.",Excluded
3694,"Outpatient follow-up of nonoperative cerebral contusion and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage: does repeat head CT alter clinical decision-making? OBJECTIVES: Many neurosurgeons obtain repeat head CT at the first clinic follow-up visit for nonoperative cerebral contusion and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH). The authors undertook a single-center, retrospective study to determine whether outpatient CT altered clinical decision-making.METHODS: The authors evaluated 173 consecutive adult patients admitted to their institution from April 2006 to August 2012 with an admission diagnosis of cerebral contusion or tSAH and at least 1 clinic follow-up visit with CT. Patients with epidural, subdural, aneurysmal subarachnoid, or intraventricular hemorrhage, and those who underwent craniotomy, were excluded. Patient charts were reviewed for new CT findings, new patient symptoms, and changes in treatment plan. Patients were stratified by neurological symptoms into 3 groups: 1) asymptomatic; 2) mild, nonspecific symptoms; and 3) significant symptoms. Mild, nonspecific symptoms included minor headaches, vertigo, fatigue, and mild difficulties with concentration, short-term memory, or sleep; significant symptoms included moderate to severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, focal neurological complaints, impaired consciousness, or new cognitive impairment evident on routine clinical examination.RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three patients met inclusion criteria, with initial clinic follow-up obtained within approximately 6 weeks. Of the 173 patients, 104 (60.1%) were asymptomatic, 68 patients (39.3%) had mild, nonspecific neurological symptoms, and 1 patient (1.0%) had significant neurological symptoms. Of the asymptomatic patients, 3 patients (2.9%) had new CT findings and 1 of these patients (1.0%) underwent a change in treatment plan because of these findings. This change involved an additional clinic appointment and CT to monitor a 12-mm chronic subdural hematoma that ultimately resolved without treatment. Of the patients with mild, nonspecific neurological symptoms, 6 patients (8.8%) had new CT findings and 3 of these patients (4.4%) underwent a change in treatment plan because of these findings; none of these patients required surgical intervention. The single patient with significant neurological symptoms did not have any new CT findings.CONCLUSIONS: Repeat outpatient CT of asymptomatic patients after nonoperative cerebral contusion and tSAH is very unlikely to demonstrate significant new pathology. Given the cost and radiation exposure associated with CT, imaging should be reserved for patients with significant symptoms or focal findings on neurological examination.",Excluded
4218,"[Intensity-modulated radiotherapy of head and neck cancers: Dose effects on the ocular, orbital and eyelid structures] Radiation-induced damage of ocular, orbital and eyelid structures are mainly reported for the optic nerve, retina, lens and lacrimal gland. Dose-volume relationships are, however, inaccurate due to the small volume of most of the organs at risk involved and limited ability of irradiation techniques to spare these structures in the pre-IMRT (intensity-modulated radiation therapy) era. The ability of newest radiation techniques including IMRT and proton therapy to generate steep dose gradients may yield more accurate models in the future. Some toxicities are severe and irreversible, leading to vision loss, as in the case of radiation-induced optic neuropathy for which curative treatments are suboptimal. Other toxicities can lead to reversible vision loss but can be surgically corrected, as is the case for radiation-induced cataract. In this paper, we will review the dose effects for the ocular; orbital and eyelid structures.",Excluded
4207,"Automated image enhancement significantly reduces radiation dosage in coronary angiographt with preserved image quality Aims: Radiation exposure is related with adverse events on population level. For healthcare workers the work related radiation dose allowed is limited by governing agencies for health purposes. Although the dosage patients receive is relatively limited, the as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA) principle remains applicable. ClarityIQ is developed to reduce the radiation exposure without loss of image quality. Methods and Results: Diagnostic coronary angiography images of the left coronary artery (LCA) were acquired in LAO 45 with 20 cranial angulation with hand injected contrast dye. Quality of ClarityIQ (50% radiation reduction) was compared with standard image acquisition (100% radiation exposure) and scored as better, good, fair and poor by the operator. Our preliminary data show that 47 patients (mean age 62.8+/-11.1) were enrolled. The mean BMI was 26.6 kg/m2+/-3.7. All had normal kidney function (MDRD >60) and no known previous myocardial infarction of the LCA. The image quality of the ClarityIQ images was of adequate diagnostic quality in all patients. ClarityIQ was not considered of better quality, in 29 cases the image quality was good and in 17 fair. In one case the operator judged the images poor based on a blurred aspect of the coronary tree, but still useful for diagnostic coronary angiography. The mean Air Kerma was 31.3 J/kg for ClarityIQ and 72.9 J/kg for the standard image acquisition (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that with a novel acquisition technique that enhances the coronary tree based on a computer algorithm adequate images can be acquired with a reduction of 43% of radiation dose. Thus resulting in less stochastic effects of radiation for the cath-lab personnel and also less deterministic effects for the patient.

The intratemporal facial nerve (IFN) is exposed to higher levels of cellular telephone radiation than intracranial tissues. The purpose of the study was to determine whether cellular telephone use is associated with an increased risk of IFN tumors.STUDY DESIGN: Case-control using a structured telephone survey at an academic, tertiary-care referral center.METHODS: Patients with IFN tumors (n = 18) were case-matched with patients treated for acoustic neuroma (n = 51), rhinosinusitis (n = 72), and dysphonia or gastroesophageal reflux disease (n = 69). Risk of facial nerve tumorigenesis was compared by extent of cellular telephone use and other risk factors.RESULTS: The odds ratio of developing an IFN tumor was 0.6 (95% CI, 0.2-1.9) with any handheld cellular telephone use and 0.4 (95% CI, 0.1-2.1) with regular cellular telephone use. No factors were associated with an increased risk for IFN tumor development.CONCLUSIONS: Regular cellular telephone use does not appear to be associated with a higher risk of IFN tumor development. The short duration of widespread cellular telephone use precludes definite exclusion as a risk for IFN tumor development.",Excluded
3818,"Motion sickness: Part III. A clinical study based on surgery of posterior fossa tumors Three patients who had large, benign cerebellar tumors were operated upon in the sitting position and developed symptoms referable to the temporoparieto-occipital region of the brain 24-48 h postoperatively. They consisted of dizziness, nausea, vomiting, formed and unformed hallucinations, and inversion of image or disorientation in space, some of which were experienced by some of the astronauts and cosmonauts during space flight. Such findings are not due to stimulation of the cerebellum, the site of the lesion, but must come from the cerebral hemisphere. The symptoms were believed to be caused by 'the luxury perfusion' of Lassen with the development of local lactic acidosis secondary to vascular insufficiency to the brain in the distribution of the posterior cerebral artery thus stimulating the temporoparieto-occipital region. This theory is suggested to some degree by the work of Endo et al. using CT scans, which showed the shifting of increased blood flow from the frontal region to the temporoparieto-occipital region following removal of a benign posterior fossa tumor. The mechanism for the compression of the posterior cerebral artery may be due to uncal herniation at the tentorium. The authors believe that it might be well to consider further testing in a vertical or oblique plane rather than only in a centrifugal horizontal one. This method would tend to cause uncal herniation more readily. Monitoring of such effects could be done with the colored CT scan.",Excluded
4103,"Mechanical allodynia induced by optogenetic sensory nerve excitation activates dopamine signaling and metabolism in medial nucleus accumbens The mesolimbic dopaminergic signaling, such as that originating from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons in the medial part of the nucleus accumbens (mNAc), plays a role in complex sensory and affective components of pain. To date, we have demonstrated that optogenetic sensory nerve stimulation rapidly alters the dopamine (DA) content within the mNAc. However, the physiological role and biochemical processes underlying such rapid and regional dynamics of DA remain unclear. In this study, using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), we observed that sensitized pain stimulation by optogenetic sensory nerve activation increased DA and 3-Methoxytyramine (3-MT; a post-synaptic metabolite obtained following DA degradation) in the mNAc of the experimental mice. To delineate the mechanism associated with elevation of DA and 3-MT, the de novo synthesized DA in the VTA/substantia nigra terminal areas was evaluated using IMS by visualizing the metabolic conversion of stable isotope-labeled tyrosine (<sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N-Tyr) to DA. Our approach revealed that at steady state, the de novo synthesized DA occupied >10% of the non-labeled DA pool in the NAc within 1.5h of isotope-labeled Tyr administration, despite no significant increase following pain stimulation. These results suggested that sensitized pain triggered an increase in the release and postsynaptic intake of DA in the mNAc, followed by its degradation, and likely delayed de novo DA synthesis. In conclusion, we demonstrated that short, peripheral nerve excitation with mechanical stimulation accelerates the mNAc-specific DA signaling and metabolism which might be associated with the development of mechanical allodynia.",Excluded
4235,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta inhibitors protect hippocampal neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis by regulating MDM2-p53 pathway Exposure of the brain to ionizing radiation can cause neurocognitive deficiencies. The pathophysiology of these neurological changes is complex and includes radiation-induced apoptosis in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. We have recently found that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) resulted in significant protection from radiation-induced apoptosis in hippocampal neurons. The molecular mechanisms of this cytoprotection include abrogation of radiation-induced accumulation of p53. Here we show that pretreatment of irradiated HT-22 hippocampal-derived neurons with small molecule inhibitors of GSK-3beta SB216763 or SB415286, or with GSK-3beta-specific shRNA resulted in accumulation of the p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Knockdown of MDM2 using specific shRNA or chemical inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction prevented the protective changes triggered by GSK-3beta inhibition in irradiated HT-22 neurons and restored radiation cytotoxicity. We found that this could be due to regulation of apoptosis by subcellular localization and interaction of GSK-3beta, p53 and MDM2. These data suggest that the mechanisms of radioprotection by GSK-3beta inhibitors in hippocampal neurons involve regulation of MDM2-dependent p53 accumulation and interactions between GSK-3beta, MDM2 and p53.",Included

We assessed the validity of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) to detect changes in ICP.METHODS: Subjects were eight patients undergoing medically necessary diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infusion testing for hydrocephalus. DPOAE measurements were obtained with an FDA-approved system at baseline and six controlled ICP levels in ~3 mmHg increments in random order, with a range from 10.8 +/- 2.9 mmHg (SD) at baseline to 32.3 +/- 4.1 mmHg (SD) at level 6.RESULTS: For f2 frequencies between 800 and 1700 Hz, when ICP was >= 12 mmHg above baseline ICP, DPOAE angles increased significantly and DPOAE magnitudes decreased significantly, but less robustly.DISCUSSION: Significant changes in DPOAE angle and magnitude are seen when ICP is >= 12 mmHg above a subject's supine baseline ICP during CSF infusion testing. These results suggest that the changes in DPOAE angle and magnitude seen with change in ICP are physiologically based, and suggest that it should be possible to detect pathological ICP elevation using DPOAE measurements. To use DPOAE for noninvasive estimation of ICP during spaceflight will require baseline measurements in the head-up, supine, and head-down positions to obtain baseline DPOAE values at different ICP ranges.

Pulmonary involvement can be seen in about 0.5 % to 2% with no difference between gender, usually in patients above 60 years old, with no correlation with smoking, radiation or chemicals. It may have prognostic variables, from the kindness of a tumor without local infiltration to metastatic and life threatening tumors. CASE PRESENTATION: MAS, male, 25 years old, resident of interior of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, workman. Six years before our first consultation, the patient presented minor bleeding with probable origin in the respiratory tract, considered initially a nasal origin. Sporadic, with no relation to climate change, physical exertion or other triggering factors. Denied other signs or symptoms. Was requested chest and sinus radiography, without alterations. Requested a CT of the chest which showed consolidation with aerobronchograms located in the apical and anterior segment of the left lower lobe. Laboratory tests without relevant findings, with negative bacillus alcohol acid resistant, culture for M. tuberculosis in sputum and serum tests for fungi. We opted for conservative treatment. Two years after the initial event, he searched pulmonology service for monitoring, and it was requested new chest CT, which showed nodule with partial bronchial obstruction and onset of the consolidation in the adjacent parenchyma. Again, the position assumed was to maintain observation of the evolution of the framework due to the absence of clinical expression. Elapsed two more years, he presented episodes of bleeding associated with cough and sneezing, more intensely. Searched otolaryngologist who requested laryngoscopy, which showed no abnormalities that could justify the symptoms. He was then referred to our clinic and brought all previously obtained material, including a new request of chest CT. He referred hemoptoics, progressive dyspnea and wheezing. Denied fever, purulent sputum expectoration, weight loss or other constitutional symptoms. Ordered additional tests including ESR (51mm ), DHL (217 UI/L), PCR (26mm ) , CEA (1.4 ng / dL), negative serology for fungi, noreactive Mantoux test. Pulmonary function tests: FVC: 2.36(46%)-2.43(47% )-(change 3%), FEV<inf>1</inf>:1.59(37%)-1.83 (43 %)-(change15%), FEV<inf>1</inf>/FVC:67% - 75%, DLCO 23,8( 1%). The previously requested tomography brought showed nodule of 3.9 cm in the left lower lobe with soft tissue attenuation, promoting partial bronchial obstruction and leading to areas of adjacent consolidation. With these results, it was requested bronchoscopy. Evolved unfavorably with intensification of the bleeding, which made us chose hospitalization for monitoring. Bronchoscopy revealed tumor mass partially obstructing the left lower lobe bronchus, infiltratating with bleeding lips. Before the results of the histopathological analysis, he evolved with intensified bleeding, with risk of death.Referred to thoracic surgery. Performed left lower lobectomy, which was uneventful and he had complete recovery. The analysis of material obtained through fiberoptic bronchoscopy as part of the surgery proved to be a typical carcinoid tumor. DISCUSSION: Carcinoid tumors represent 1% to 2 % of cancers affecting the lung, with higher incidence in age above 60 years. Presents an indolent growth and may remain asymptomatic for several years, with the first manifestations being the presence of hemoptysis and dyspnea.It can produce metastasis, leading to carcinoid syndrome, characterized by a systemic clinical picture. For diagnosis it should take into account the correlation of imaging tests and biopsy either via endoscopic or thoracotomy, depending on the location of the tumor or the physician's choice. The curative treatment is done surgically with resection of the tumor.

The prevalence of menstrual disorder was 12.0% in the unexposed group, but was 26.8% and 33.8% in low and high-exposure groups, respectively (P<0.01). Exposure-response relationships were found between cumulate exposure and neurovegetative symptoms and menstrual disorder (P<0.05). Serum progesterone (P<inf>4</inf>) was significantly lower in the exposed groups (P<0.01). Conclusion(s): EMFs exposure was associated with adverse health effects, including neurovegetative symptoms, menstrual disorder, and low level of P<inf>4</inf>.

4240,"Prognostic value of radiographically defined extranodal extension in human papillomavirus-associated locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma Background: Pathologic extranodal extension (ENE) has traditionally guided the management of head and neck cancers. The prognostic value of radiographic ENE (rENE) in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV + OPX) is uncertain. Method(s): Patients with HPV + OPX with adequate pretreatment radiographic nodal evaluation from a single institution were analyzed. rENE status was determined by neuroradiologists' at time of diagnosis. Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), overall survival (OS), and locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to assess the impact of rENE on survival endpoints. Result(s): Hundred sixty-eight patients with OPX + squamous cell carcinomas diagnosed between April 2008 and December 2014 were included for analysis with median follow-up of 3.3 years. Eighty-eight percent of patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy. rENE was not prognostic; its presence in patients with HPV + OPX did not significantly impact OS, LRFS, or DMFS. Conclusion(s): In patients with HPV + OPX, rENE was not significantly associated with OS, LRFS, or DMFS. Copyright Â© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
4017,"Diagnostic Reference Levels for Adult Nuclear Medicine Imaging Established from the National Survey in Korea Purpose: There is substantial need for optimizing radiation protection in nuclear medicine imaging studies. However, the diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) have not yet been established for nuclear medicine imaging studies in Korea. Material(s) and Method(s): The data of administered activity in 32 nuclear medicine imaging studies were collected from the Korean Society of Nuclear Medicine (KSNM) dose survey database from 2013 and 2014. Through the expert discussions and statistical analyses, the 75th quartile value (Q3) was suggested as the preliminary DRL values. Preliminary DRLs were subjected to approval process by the KSNM Board of Directors and KSNM Council, followed by clinical applications and performance rating by domestic institutes. Result(s): DRLs were determined through 32 nuclear medicine imaging studies. The Q3 value was considered as appropriate selection as it was generally consistent with the most commonly administered activity. In the present study, the final version of initial DRL values for nuclear medicine imaging in Korean adults is described including various protocols of the brain and myocardial perfusion imaging. Conclusion(s): The first DRLs for nuclear medicine imaging in Korean adults were confirmed. The DRLs will enable optimized radiation protection in the field of nuclear medicine imaging in Korea.

4343,"Death of neurons and glial cells, induced by a photodynamic injury: signaling processes and neurone-glial interactions. [Russian] The mechanisms of photodynamic (PD) injury of neurons and glial cells are reviewed. Neuron responses: firing stimulation at high photosensitizer concentrations and inhibition at low concentrations (< 10(-7) M) that were followed by necrosis, are described. Glial cells died from both necrosis and apoptosis. Local laser inactivation of a neuron enhanced PD-induced apoptosis of glial cells, thus indicating that neuron maintained the survival of glia. Inter- and intracellular signaling mediated photodamage of these cells. Using inhibitors or activators of signaling proteins, the involvement of Ca(2+)-, adenylate cyclase- and tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling pathways in responses of neurons and glial cells to photosensitization was shown. Their pharmacological modulation can change selectivity of PD injury of neuronal and glial cells and efficiency of PD therapy.",Excluded
3942,"Thiol activation of endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15. A novel mechanism for the regulation of catalytic activity Endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15 (EP24.15) is a thermolysin-like metalloendopeptidase involved in the regulated metabolism of a number of neuropeptides. Unlike other thermolysin-like peptidases EP24.15 displays a unique thiol activation, a mechanism that is not clearly understood. In this study we show that both recombinant and tissue-derived EP24.15 are activated up to 8-fold by low concentrations (0.1 mM) of dithiothreitol. Additionally, under non-reducing conditions, recombinant and native EP24.15 forms multimers that can be returned to the monomeric form by reduction. We have also shown that competitive inhibitor binding occurs only to the monomeric form, which indicates that catalytic site access is restricted in the multimeric forms. Through systematic site-directed mutagenesis we have identified that cysteine residues 246, 253, and possibly 248 are involved in the formation of these multimers. Furthermore, both a double mutant (C246S/C253S) and a triple mutant (C246S/C248S/C253S) are fully active in the absence of reducing agents, as measured by both inhibitor binding and hydrolysis. The formation and disruption of disulfide bonds involving these cysteine residues may be a mechanism by which EP24.15 activity is regulated through changes in intra- and extracellular redox potential.",Excluded
4285,"Treatment of progression of diffuse astrocytoma by herbal medicine: Case report Background: The paper presents the results of the use of phytotherapy in a 33-year-old woman who, after finishing the oncological treatment of diffuse astrocytoma, had tumour progression. Material(s) and Method(s): Phytotherapy was introduced after the tumour had progressed. It consisted of 4 types of herbal medicine which the subject was taking in form of tea once a day at regular intervals. The patient started phytotherapy along with temozolomide, which was the only oncological treatment she was under after the tumour had progressed. Following the finished chemotherapy, the patient continued the treatment with herbal medicine only. She regularly took phytotherapy without interruption and to the fullest extent for 30 months, and the results of treatment were monitored by periodic scanning using nuclear magnetic resonance technique. Result(s): The control scanning that was conducted after the end of combined treatment with temozolomide and phytotherapy showed tumour regression. The patient continued with phytotherapy after finishing chemotherapy and, during the following 24 months, it was the sole treatment option. In that period, the regression of the tumour continued, until a control examination 30 months after the introduction of phytotherapy showed no clinical and radiological signs of tumour. Conclusion(s): The results presented in this research paper clearly indicate the potential of phytotherapy in the treatment of some types of brain tumours. A complete regression of tumour following the treatment with nothing but herbal medicine offers support for such claim. Future research should demonstrate the effectiveness of phytotherapy, as a supplementary form of brain tumour treatment, and the results of this research should be compared with the existing information on the effectiveness of the protocols currently used in the treatment of these types of tumour.

3789,"Health-Related Quality of Life in large recurrence Glioblastoma treated with protontherapy Purpose or Objective: Protontherapy (PT) could minimize the risk of side effects compared to conventional photon therapy and therefore reduce the possible detrimental effect on QoL of reirradiation. We report the effect of re-irradiation with active scanning PT of large recurrence GBM in terms of quality of life scored by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)--C30 and EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Brain Cancer Module (QLQ-BN20). Material(s) and Method(s): Between January 2015 and October 2018 thirty patients with recurrence GBM were re-irradiated with active scanning PT. All patients had been previously treated with photon radiotherapy (60 Gy) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ). Median age and Karnofsky performance status at re-irradiation were 53 years (range, 30-68 years) and 80%, (range, 60-100%), respectively. Target definition was based on CT, MR, and 18F-DOPA PET imaging. Median CTV (clinical target volume) was 69 cc (range, 11-259 cc). All patients received 36 GyRBE (RBE: relative biologic effectiveness) in 18 fractions, with concomitant TMZ in 7 patients (25%). Subscales within the EORTC QLQ-C30 include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), three symptoms scales (nausea, vomiting, and fatigue), six single-item scales (insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, dyspnea, and financial effect of tumor/treatment) and global QoL. The BN20 is specifically developed for brain patients and assessed visual disorders, motor function, communication deficit, various disease symptoms, treatment, toxicity and future uncertainty. The patients completed the EORTC questionnaires before starting PT, the day of the end of PT and every follow-up consult (1-month, 3-months) until progression of disease. Result(s): The treatment was associated with stability in most of the preselected HRQOL domains. Global health improved over time with a maximum difference of 6 points between baseline and 3-months follow-up. Social functioning and motor dysfunction improved over time with a maximum difference of 8 and 2 points, respectively. We showed only a small not significance decrease in cognitive and emotional functioning. Interestingly, fatigue remained stable during the analysis such as the other preselected domains. Increase of CTV, use of steroids before protontherapy and concomitant chemotherapy are associated with a statistically significantworse QLQ C30_Social, QLQ C30_Physical and BN20_Motor values. Conclusion(s): Re-irradiation with PT for a large recurrence Glioblastoma is a safe treatment without a negative effect on HRQOL until the time of disease progression.

4417,"Medically inoperable early-stage small cell lung cancer: Patterns of failure after SBRT, adjuvant chemotherapy, and PCI Purpose/Objective(s): To report on the patterns of failure for medically inoperable early stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) when stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) manages the primary lung tumor. Materials/Methods: We queried our institutional IRB-approved SBRT registry for the period 2004-2014 for any early stage SCLC patients with a minimum of 6 months follow up. All patients had biopsy proven disease and were deemed medically inoperable after tumor board review. Routine staging consisted of PET/CT and MRI brain scans only. The treatment model consisted of SBRT to the primary followed by adjuvant platinum based chemotherapy (CHT) and then prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). SBRT was delivered employing a stereotactic-specific LINAC with vacuum-bag based immobilization, abdominal compression, and infrared based X-ray positioning system+/- CBCT for image-guidance. Result(s): Of 747 definitively treated cancers over 10 years, 16 (2%) were SCLCs meeting study criteria. Patient characteristics revealed: median KPS was 80 (range 50-90), median age was 69 years (range 45-87), 50% of patients were female, median BMI was 28.2 (range 17.4-41.2). Tumor characteristics revealed: median tumor size was 3.25cm (range1.4-7.2), 4 (25%) tumors were ""central"" (per RTOG 0813 criteria), median PET-SUV<inf>max</inf> was 10.3 (range 2.8-21.1). Median time to SBRT from diagnosis was 2.1 months (range 0.6-6.7). SBRT schedules were: 60 Gy/3 fractions in 25%, 50 Gy/5 fractions in 68.75%, and 30 Gy/1 fractions in 6.25% of cases. Mean follow up was 15 months. Fifteen (94%) received at least 2 cycles CHT, 2 (12.5%) received CHT before SBRT. Nine patients (56%) received PCI and of the 7 (44%) that did not, 1 developed brain metastases prior, 1 refused, and 5 died of non-cancer issues before PCI . There was no grade 3 or higher toxicity; rate of grade 2 or less toxicity was 12.5%. Seven patients (43.75%) were alive at analysis and of the 9 deaths, 2 (22%) were cancer, 5 were non-cancer (56%), 2 unknown cause (22%). Local control was 100% with 13 patients (81.25%) without any failure. Crude rates of failure were one (6.25%) distant and regional nodal and two (12.5%) distant. Median survival was 39 months. Three-year actuarial overall and progression-free survivals were 50.5% and 76%, respectively. Conclusion(s): SBRT for stage I medically inoperable SCLC yields excellent local control. The minimal regional nodal failure lends support to PET for mediastinal staging. The primary failure pattern is distant.",Excluded
3717,"Glioproliferative lesion of the spinal cord derived from intrathecal administration of stem cells OBJECTIVE: To report a case of spinal cord neoplasm caused by intrathecal stem cell transplantation in the setting of ""stem cell tourism."" BACKGROUND: Stem cell transplantation (SCT) into the neuraxis is being investigated as a potential therapy for a variety of neurologic conditions. However, studies to date have not demonstrated definitive benefit and reports have highlighted risks such as malignancy. Despite this, increasing numbers of individuals with neurologic disease are lured to international centers providing unregulated stem cell therapies, an industry termed ""stem cell tourism."" DESIGN: case report CASE: A 66-year-old man underwent multiple commercial infusions of stem cells (allogeneic, embryonic neural, and mesenchymal) at various sites around the world to treat deficits from an ischemic stroke. He subsequently developed progressive lower back pain, paraplegia, and urinary incontinence. MRI of the spine demonstrated an enhancing, intradural, extramedullary mass from T10 to the distal thecal sac encasing the cauda equina nerve roots and conus medullaris. RESULT(S): Histopathologic evaluation of biopsied tissue from T10 revealed two populations of cells: primitive-appearing atypical cells (~50[percnt] expressing SOX2; neural marker) and glial differentiated cells with vascular proliferation. Both populations demonstrated negative embryonic stem cell markers (OCT3/4) and leukocyte markers (CD45). Short tandem repeat molecular analysis showed 62 +/- 8 [percnt] of cells contained non-host DNA, most likely derived from one non-patient human. Oncopanel targeted exome DNA sequencing showed no pathogenic mutations. Radiation was administered with 48.6 Gy/27 fractions from C4 to thecal sac, delivered in 3 shrinking field doses. Subsequent imaging showed significant mass reduction and the patient reported improvement in right lower extremity mobility over the weeks following treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Unregulated intrathecal SCT can cause devastating complications. This patient's highly proliferative neoplasm developing from pluripotent stem cells supports the ideological shift to employ more differentiated cells in future SCT research.",Excluded
4420,"Gamma probe-assisted brain tumor microsurgical resection: a new technique OBJECTIVES: The pioneering performance of gamma probe-assisted surgery (GPAS) for brain tumors, aiming not only an improvement of tumor detection, but mainly assurance of its complete removal and the study of the usual distribution of the 99mTc-MIBI in the brain SPECT of normal individuals.METHOD: Patient's informed consent and demonstration of the tumor by the preoperative MIBI SPECT were the inclusion criteria adopted for GPAS, which was performed in one patient with a right parietal lobe metastatic tumor. The radiotracer (99mTc-MIBI) was injected in a peripheral vein 5 hours before the operation. A tumor to-normal tissue count ratio equal to or greater than 2/1 was considered indicative of tumor. MIBI SPECT was performed in five normal individuals in a pilot study.RESULTS: The gamma probe greatly facilitated intraoperative tumor detection (tumor to-normal brain count ratio was 5/1) and indicated a small piece of residual tumor after what was thought to be a complete tumor removal, allowing its resection, which, otherwise, would have been left behind. Postoperative CT confirmed complete tumor resection. The MIBI SPECT in normal individuals showed an increased uptake by the hypophisis, choroid plexus, skull, scalp and salivary glands and absence of uptake by the normal brain tissue. There were no complications.CONCLUSION: GPAS proved to be, in this single case, a safe and reliable technique to improve brain tumor detection and to confirm the presence or absence of residual tumor.",Excluded

4260,"Assessment of radiotherapeutic effect on brain tumors by dynamic susceptibility contrast MR imaging: a preliminary report PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess tumor vascularity of the brain by dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MR imaging and to determine whether this method is clinically useful for monitoring radiation effects on brain tumors. We, furthermore, compared DSC MR imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using technetium-99m diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid human serum albumin (99mTc-HSA-D) in the assessment of tumor vascularity in a limited numbers of cases.METHODS: Twelve patients with various kinds of brain tumors were studied. DSC MRI was performed on all patients before and after radiation therapy. SPECT using 99mTc-HSA-D was also performed in five patients. The rate of change in tumor blood volume in response to radiation therapy was evaluated with DSC MRI and SPECT. The rate of change in tumor volume in response to radiation was also measured.RESULTS: Ten patients were successfully studied. The rate of change in tumor blood volume correlated well between DSC MRI and SPECT. There was no significant correlation between the rates of change for tumor blood volume and tumor volume. Changes in tumor vascularity preceded the reduction in tumor volume seen following radiotherapy.CONCLUSION: DSC MRI provides information regarding radiation effects on tumor vessels that is not available with conventional MRI.",Excluded

3862,"Electrical stimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex inhibits spinal dorsal horn neuron activity Cortical stimulation has been demonstrated to alleviate certain pain conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the responses of the spinal cord dorsal horn neurons to stimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex (SSC). We hypothesized that direct stimulation of the SSC will inhibit the activity of spinal dorsal horn neurons by activating the descending inhibitory system. Thirty-four wide dynamic range spinal dorsal horn neurons were recorded in response to graded mechanical stimulation (brush, pressure, and pinch) at their respective receptive fields while a stepwise electrical stimulation (300 Hz, 0.1 ms, at 10, 20, and 30 V) was applied in the SSC through a bipolar tungsten electrode. The responses to brush at control, 10 V, 20 V, 30 V, and recovery were 16.0 +/- 2.3, 15.8 +/- 2.2, 14.6 +/- 1.8, 14.8 +/- 2.0, and 17.0 +/- 2.2 spikes/s, respectively. The responses to pressure at control, 10 V, 20 V, 30 V, and recovery were 44.7 +/- 5.5, 37.0 +/- 5.6, 29.5 +/- 4.8, 31.6 +/- 5.2, and 43.2 +/- 5.7 spikes/s, respectively.

3988,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation in extensive disease small-cell lung cancer: Short-term health-related quality of life and patient reported symptoms-results of an international phase III randomized controlled trial by the EORTC radiation oncology and lung cancer groups Purpose Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients with extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) leads to significantly fewer symptomatic brain metastases and improved survival. Detailed effects of PCI on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are reported here. Patients and Methods Patients (age, 18 to 75 years; WHO <= 2) with ED-SCLC, and any response to chemotherapy, were randomly assigned to either observation or PCI. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and patient-reported symptoms were secondary end points. The European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer core HRQOL tool (Quality of Life Questionnaire C30) and brain module (Quality of Life Questionnaire Brain Cancer Module) were used to collect self-reported patient data. Six HRQOL scales were selected as primary HRQOL end points: global health status; hair loss; fatigue; and role, cognitive and emotional functioning. Assessments were performed at random assignment, 6 weeks, 3 months, and then 3-monthly up to 1 year and 6-monthly thereafter. Results Compliance with the HRQOL assessment was 93.7% at baseline and dropped to 60% at 6 weeks. Short-term results up to 3 months showed that there was a negative impact of PCI on selected HROOL scales. The largest mean difference between the two arms was observed for fatigue and hair loss. The impact of PCI on global health status as well as on functioning scores was more limited. For global health status, the observed mean difference was eight points on a scale 0 to 100 at 6 weeks (P = .018) and 3 months (P = .055).

Clinicians should be alert to these; monitor their patients; and offer appropriate support, clinical, and psychosocial care. Â©2008 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
3710,"Presynaptic serotonergic modulation of 5-HT and acetylcholine release in the hippocampus and the cortex of 5-HT1B-receptor knockout mice Lesioning of serotonergic afferents increases hippocampal ACh release and attenuates memory deficits produced by cholinergic lesions. Improved memory performance described in 5-HT1B-knockout (KO) mice might thus be due to a weaker 5-HT1B-mediated inhibitory influence of 5-HT on hippocampal ACh release. The selective delay-dependent impairment of working memory observed in these KO mice suggests, however, that cortical regions also participate in task performance, possibly via indirect influences of 5-HT on ACh release. To provide neuropharmacological support for these hypotheses we measured evoked ACh and 5-HT release in hippocampal and cortical slices of wild-type (WT) and 5-HT1B KO mice. Superfused slices (preincubated with [3H]choline or [3H]5-HT) were electrically stimulated in the absence or presence of 5-HT1B receptor ligands. In hippocampus and cortex, 5-HT1B agonists decreased and antagonists increased 5-HT release in WT, but not in 5-HT1B KO mice. In 5-HT1B KO mice, 5-HT release was enhanced in both structures, while ACh release (in nCi) was reduced. ACh release was inhibited by 5-HT1B agonists in hippocampal (not cortical) slices of WT but not of 5-HT1B KO mice. Our data (i) confirm the absence of autoinhibition of 5-HT release in 5-HT1B-KO mice, (ii) demonstrate a reduced release of ACh, and the absence of 5-HT1B-receptor-mediated inhibition of ACh release, in the hippocampus and cortex of 5-HT1B-KO mice, and (iii) are compatible with an indirect role of cortical ACh in the working memory impairment observed in these KO mice.",Excluded
3991,"Neurological observations after local irradiation and hyperthermia of rat lumbosacral spinal cord PURPOSE: Investigation of the effects of hyperthermia on the radiation response of rat lumbosacral spinal cord with respect to: (a) incidence of paralysis, (b) latency, (c) histopathology, and (d) tumor induction.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Rat lumbosacral spinal cord with the cauda equina was single-dose irradiated with 15 to 32 Gy of x-rays. Hyperthermia for 30 min at a spinal cord temperature of 41.1, 42.3, and 42.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C was applied 5 to 10 min after irradiation by means of a 434 MHz microwave applicator. Animals were observed for 21 months while recording myelopathy and development of tumors.RESULTS: The latent period for hind leg paralysis decreased with increasing radiation dose from 359 +/- 31 days (n = 9) after 20 Gy to 200 +/- 4 days (n = 5) after 32 Gy. Hyperthermia enhanced the radiation response of the lumbosacral spinal cord as evidenced by shortening of the latent period for paralysis and a decrease in the biological effective dose. After 20 Gy followed by 30 min 41.1 degrees C, latency was diminished to 214 +/- 16 days (n = 7, p < 0.001 vs. 20 Gy alone). The ED50 was 21.1 Gy, which was diminished to values between 16 and 17 Gy if radiation was followed by hyperthermia, giving a thermal enhancement ratio between 1.24 and 1.32. Histopathological examination of the spinal cord after combined treatment of x-rays and hyperthermia showed necrosis of nerve roots. Irradiation with 16, 20, 24, and 28 Gy (n = 77) alone led to tumor induction in 17 +/- 8% of the animals (pooled data). If followed by hyperthermia (n = 96), it was increased to 33 +/- 12% (p < 0.01). Most tumors induced by radiation and hyperthermia were sarcomas.CONCLUSION: First, the radiation response of rat lumbosacral spinal cord was enhanced by heat. Second, latency for paralysis was shortened in the lower dose range. Third, no difference in pathology between x-rays alone or in combination with hyperthermia. Fourth, hyperthermia did increase radiation carcinogenesis.",Included
3791,"Radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases based on a fast, three-dimensional MR imaging technique A fast, three-dimensional (3D) sequence for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain and its application in radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases is reported. The measuring sequence (MPRAGE) requires magnetization-prepared 180degree inversion pulses followed by rapid low angle excitation pulses and gradient-echoes for image generation. The resulting T<inf>1</inf>-weighted MPRAGE images were compared with two-dimensional (2D) T<inf>1</inf>- weighted spin-echo (SE) images after administration of 0.1 mmol/kg b.w. Gd- DTPA in 10 patients with known brain metastases. Original or multiplanar reformatted images obtained from a 128 partition data set of the 3D MPRAGE sequence offered comparable diagnostic quality to that of 2D SE imaging. Gd- DTPA enhancement and lesion targeting was similar in most of the patients in SE as well as MPRAGE imaging. During imaging and therapy the patient's head was fixed in a stereotactic localization system which is usable at the MR and the linear accelerator installations. The dose calculation of the radiosurgery planning was based on 3D MR imaging data assuming a homogenous attenuation value inside the head which was sufficient for an accurate dose calculation since tissue inhomogeneities do not significantly influence the shape of the relative dose distribution especially for radiosurgery of the brain. Under this circumstance the dose calculation can be based only on the 3D geometric conformation of the patient's head. A simple algorithm for treatment planning can be used if the MR data are free of geometric distortion. Target point definition, external head contour, and critical structures could be precisely defined in 3D MPRAGE images offering important advantages (i.e., improved spatial resolution, reformatted image reconstruction, rapid 3D imaging and short examination time under mask fixation resulting in better patient comfort, better slice profile, reduced vascular pulsation artefacts, superior and variable choice of soft tissue contrast due to centric phase-encoding order, lower specific absorption rate) over conventional 2D SE imaging. In addition, target volume, calculated dose distribution, and critical structures can be displayed as 3D shaded structures for better assessment for matching of target volume and dose distribution. These findings, along with other advantages of 3D imaging, indicate that the MPRAGE sequence may provide an alternative to T<inf>1</inf>-weighted 2D SE imaging in the radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases.",Excluded

4778,"Microwaves and Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's diseases (AD) is the most common type of dementia and a neurodegenerative disease that occurs when the nerve cells in the brain die. The cause and treatment of AD remain unknown. However, AD is a disease that affects the brain, an organ that controls behavior. Accordingly, anything that can interact with the brain may affect this organ positively or negatively, thereby protecting or encouraging AD. In this regard, modern life encompasses microwaves for all issues including industrial, communications, medical and domestic tenders, and among all applications, the cell phone wave, which directly exposes the brain, continues to be the most used. Evidence suggests that microwaves may produce various biological effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and many arguments relay the possibility that microwaves may be involved in the pathophysiology of CNS disease, including AD. By contrast, previous studies have reported some beneficial cognitive effects and that microwaves may protect against cognitive impairment in AD. However, although many of the beneficial effects of microwaves are derived from animal models, but can easily be extrapolated to humans, whether microwaves cause AD is an important issue that is to be addressed in the current review.

The pineal gland of Sprague-Dawley rats housed under a LD regime (n=42) for four weeks and of a regime (n=42) for eight weeks were sampled at six different times, every 4 h (n=7 animals per time point), during a 24 h period. Total RNA was extracted from each sample, and the semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine temporal changes in mRNA levels of Clock and NAT genes during different circadian or zeitgeber times. The data and parameters were analyzed by the cosine function software, Clock Lab software, and the amplitude F test was used to reveal the circadian rhythm. In the DD or LD condition, both the Clock and NAT mRNA levels in the pineal gland showed robust circadian oscillation (p<0.05) with the peak at the subjective night or at nighttime. In comparison with the DD regime, the amplitudes and mRNA levels at the peaks of Clock and NAT expressions in LD in the pineal gland were significantly reduced (p<0.05). In the DD or LD condition, the circadian expressions of NAT were similar in pattern to those of Clock in the pineal gland (p>0.05). These findings indicate that the transcriptions of Clock and NAT genes in the pineal gland not only show remarkably synchronous endogenous circadian rhythmic changes, but also respond to the ambient light signal in a reduced manner.",Excluded
4541,"Neuroprotective effect of liu wei di huang tang on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice OBJECTIVE To explore the effect and mechanisms of LW-AFC, a new formula derived from Liu Wei Di Huang Tang, on irradiation-induced reduction of mice adult hippocampal neurogenesis. METHODS C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into seven groups (n=10): control group, LW-AFC group (1.6 g?kg<sup>-1</sup>), Liu Wei Di Huang Tang (LW) group (10 g-kg<sup>-1</sup>), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) group, irradiation group, irradiation+ LW group, and irradiation + LW-AFC group. Reduction of mice adult hippocampal neurogenesis was induced by cranial irradiation. LW-AFC was administered by oral gavage for 30 d after cranial irradiation treatment. Immunofluorescence and Nissl's staining were performed for histological morphology assessment. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining was used in the detection of proliferation cells. The peripheral blood and hippocampal homogenate were collected to measure the content of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (INF-y), interleukin-1 (3 (IL-1(3), IL-4 and IL-10. The hippocampal homogenate was used for Western blot to detect the BDNFkappaB signal pathway, including extracellular regulated protein kinases1/2 (ERK1/2) and BDNF target protein. Morris water maze and new object recognition test were performed to examine the cognitive function of mice. The mice forced swimming and tail suspension test were used to assess alteration in depressive behavior. Long term potentiation was used to examine the synaptic plasticity change of mice. RESULTS Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly reduced after irradiation of 20 Gray dose (10 Gray per day, total 2 d). LW-AFC treatment increased the BrdU number of irradiated mice (P<0.05). In Morris water maze test, LW-AFC group showed decreased escape latency in the learning period (P<0.05), while increased the number of crossing the platform in the memory period. LW-AFC can also reduce the immobility time of mice in the tail suspension test (P<0.01). CONCLUSION LW-AFC modulates adult neurogenesis to ameliorate cognitive impairment and reduce depressive behavior in radiation injury mice.",Included
4622,"Clinical outcome and prognostic factors for central neurocytoma Purpose/Objective(s): Central neurocytomas are intraventricular neoplasms of the central nervous system that comprise 0.25- 0.5% of brain tumors and their optimal management remains controversial due to their rarity. We assessed clinical outcome for a historical cohort of neurocytoma patients and evaluated effects of tumor atypia, tumor size, extent of resection (EOR), and adjuvant radiation (RT). Materials/Methods: Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from date of first surgical resection. Differences in PFS were measured by Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazard ratio methods. Tumor atypia was defined as MIB-1 index >2%, focal necrosis, or microvascular proliferation, as previously established. Result(s): A total of 22 patients (14 males, 8 females) were treated between 1995 and 2009, with a median age at diagnosis of 24 years (range 11-62). A total of 8 patients experienced recurrent/progressive disease. Median follow-up by MRI was 38 month (range 0.1-183) for those who have not progressed. Overall 3-yr PFS was 70% (CI 41-86%). Only three patients died and all had atypical tumors. For the remaining patients, median follow-up for survival was 51 month (range 0.1-183). We examined effects of tumor atypia and MIB-1 labeling. Ten of 22 tumors had atypical features. There was near 100% concordance between tumor atypia and MIB-1 labeling: only 1 tumor was atypical based on microvascular proliferation but had MIB-1 <= 2%. Three-year PFS was 78% for MIB labeling <= 2% and 39% for MIB labeling >2% (HR 7.7, CI 2 - 40, p = 0.016). Median tumor diameter was 4.3 cm (range 0.8-8.6 cm). Three-yr PFS was 48% (CI 21-77%) for tumor >4.3 cm and 74.1% (CI 29-93%) for tumor <=4.3 cm (HR 1.6, CI 0.5 - 6.6, p = 0.49). We examined influence of EOR and adjuvant RT. Five patients had gross total resection (GTR), and 17 had subtotal resection (STR). No patient had a biopsy only. Seven patients progressed after STR, and one patient recurred after GTR. None of the GTR patients received adjuvant RT and four of the STR patients received adjuvant RT. Three-year PFS rates by extent of resection and adjuvant RT are shown (in table below). Conclusion(s): For patients with central neurocytoma, MIB-1 labeling index >2% significantly predicts worse outcome. The additional criteria for tumor atypia did not add useful prognostic information. Although patient numbers are too small for conclusive confirmation, our data indicate that lesser EOR and larger tumors size may confer worse prognosis and adjuvant RTafter STR may improve PFS.

[Russian] A course of radiation of biologically active points of the guinea pig lumbosacral area has been performed by means of focused frequency-modulated and a continuous beam of the helium-neon laser, having various power density, as well as by means of an impulsive magnetic field. A comparative histoenzymatic analysis of sensitive neurons of the lumbar spinal nodes and of the caudal-mesenteric motor neurons has been carried out. The response of the metabolic processes in the sensitive neurons depends not so much on the type of action, as on adequacy of the parameters applied. The power density, frequency of impulse generation and time of application are important for characterization of the adequacy of the laser radiation. Peculiarities of the metabolic reactions in the sensitive and sympathetic neurons in response to the actions studied are discussed.",Excluded
4003,"SRS of brain AVM Brain AVM was one of the first pathologies treated with stereotactic radiosurgery, notably the Gammaknife. Almost all treatment and outcome models are thus derived from the abundance of data from Gammaknife treatment. Due to differences in radiation dose distribution these models may not be fully applicable to treatment with linear accelerator or proton beam generator. The results from SRS of brain AVMare predictable and depend on a few well defined parameters: The chance for obliteration depends on the radiation dose to the periphery of the AVM nidus. Typically a radiation dose of 25Gy will incure an 80% chance for obliteration over a three year period. The risk for adverse radiation effects (oedema, radionecrosis, cysts) depends on the amount of energy deposited into the target and the surrounding brain. Thus the higher the radiation dose and the bigger the target the higher the risk. The risk for hemorrhage during the latency period before occlusion (maximum of three years) depends on the radiation dose to the periphery of the nidus, the nidus volume, previous recent hemorrhage and probably AVM location. Thus the higher the radiation dose and the smaller the target - the lower the risk for hemorrhage. Previous recent hemorrhage and central AVM location increases the risk.",Excluded

As a result of the examination, 603 persons (54.6%) made up a group at greater risk for cerebrovascular insufficiency. Arterial hypertension was found to be the leading risk factor while the age 45-49 years turned out most dangerous from the standpoint of the onset of the diseases under consideration. No relationship was established between the total dose of external radiation and the risk of the development of cerebrovascular disorders. 96 persons at greater risk for CVD were subjected to a thorough clinical and instrumental examination. Of these, 79.2% appeared to have initial manifestations of brain circulatory insufficiency and stage I dyscirculatory encephalopathy.",Included

Material(s) and Method(s): The Guidelines approved in 2009 by the SIR Safety and Health Committee and the CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee have been applied in a university hospital over the last two years to identify patients with potential skin injuries after procedures over thresholds requiring follow-up: peak skin dose >3 Gy, reference point air kerma >5 Gy, kerma area product >500 Gy.cm2 or fluoroscopy time >60 min. X-ray system (biplane with flat detectors) was under a quality assurance program and patient dose records were archived individually according to the national regulations. Result(s): A total of 325 procedures (43% therapeutic, mainly cerebral embolizations) were included in the database during 2009 and 383 (40% therapeutic) during 2010. Out of these samples, and after analysing each dose report individually, during 2009, 20 patients (6.2%) were included in a follow-up program for potential skin injuries, while in 2010, after introducing several optimization actions, only 6 patients (1.6%) required the follow-up. The maximum patient dose values measured in a single procedure were 1405 Gy.cm2 and 10.8 Gy (cumulative skin dose). 11 patients resulted with radiation injuries.

4820,"Matched-filter coding of sky polarization results in an internal sun compass in the brain of the desert locust Many animals use celestial cues for spatial orientation. These include the sun and, in insects, the polarization pattern of the sky, which depends on the position of the sun. The central complex in the insect brain plays a key role in spatial orientation. In desert locusts, the angle of polarized light in the zenith above the animal and the direction of a simulated sun are represented in a compass-like fashion in the central complex, but how both compasses fit together for a unified representation of external space remained unclear. To address this question, we analyzed the sensitivity of intracellularly recorded central-complex neurons to the angle of polarized light presented from up to 33 positions in the animal's dorsal visual field and injected Neurobiotin tracer for cell identification. Neurons were polarization sensitive in large parts of the virtual sky that in some cells extended to the horizon in all directions. Neurons, moreover, were tuned to spatial patterns of polarization angles that matched the sky polarization pattern of particular sun positions. The horizontal components of these calculated solar positions were topographically encoded in the protocerebral bridge of the central complex covering 360degree of space. This whole-sky polarization compass does not support the earlier reported polarization compass based on stimulation from a small spot above the animal but coincides well with the previously demonstrated direct sun compass based on unpolarized light stimulation. Therefore, direct sunlight and whole-sky polarization complement each other for robust head direction coding in the locust central complex.",Excluded
4015,"Possible involvement of hippocampal immediate-early genes in contextual fear memory deficit induced by cranial irradiation Cranial irradiation can trigger adverse effects on brain functions, including cognitive ability. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying radiation-induced cognitive impairments remain still unknown. Immediate-early genes (IEGs) are implicated in neuronal plasticity and the related functions (i.e., memory formation) in the hippocampus. The present study quantitatively assessed changes in the mRNA and protein levels of the learning-induced IEGs, including Arc, c-fos, and zif268, in the mouse hippocampus after cranial irradiation using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Mice (male, 8-week-old C57BL/6) received whole-brain irradiation with 0 or 10Gy of gamma-ray and, 2weeks later, contextual fear conditioning (CFC) was used to induce IEGs. In the CFC task, mice evaluated 2weeks after irradiation exhibited significant memory deficits compared with sham (0Gy)-irradiated controls. The levels of mRNA encoding IEGs were significantly upregulated in the hippocampus 10 and 30min after CFC training. The mRNA levels in the irradiated hippocampi were significantly lower than those in the sham-irradiated controls. The IEG protein levels were significantly increased in all hippocampal regions, including the hippocampal dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis (CA)1, and CA3, after CFC training. The CFC-induced upregulation of Arc and c-fos in 10Gy-irradiated hippocampi was significantly lower than that in sham-irradiated controls, although there were no significant differences in the protein levels of the learning-induced zif268 between sham-irradiated and 10Gy-irradiated hippocampi. Thus, cranial irradiation with 10Gy of gamma-ray impairs the induction of hippocampal IEGs (particularly Arc and c-fos) via behavioral contextual fear memory, and this disturbance may be associated with the memory deficits evident in mice after cranial irradiation, possibly through the dysregulation of neuronal plasticity during memory formation.",Included

Moreover, the results gained are very inconsistent, and some are even contradictory to each other. Objective(s): To elucidate whether low power He-Ne laser radiation can affects serotonin(5-HT) and dopamine(DA) in brain. Design(s): A completely randomlized study based on the experimental. Setting and Materials: The experiment was done in the Central Laboratory of the First Hospital of Beijing University. Materials used were 90 Kunming male mice with body-weight 20-27 g, supplied by Beijing University Animal Centre. Intervention(s): The mice were randomly assigned to 5 groups with randomized arithmetic form. They are normal control group, sham radiation group, aser irradiation group A(13.8 J/cm<sup>2</sup>), aser irradiation group B (27.6 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) and laser irradiation group C(55.1 J/cm<sup>2</sup>).

Living creature samples were made. Main Outcome Measure(s): The cerebral serotonin and dopamine were observed and measured by means of high performance liguid chromatography-electrochemistry (HPLC-EC). Result(s): Dopamine contents (ng/g) were 485.4 +/- 10.1 in laser group A, 505.8 +/- 10.3 in laser group B and 524.1 +/- 10.5 in laser group C, with significant difference as compared with that of the sham laser group( 446.5 +/- 7.1) (P < 0.05, F = 4.64; P < 0.01, F = 8.63; P < 0.01, F = 14.52, respectively).

Standard nerve conduction studies and somatosensory evoked potentials assess Abeta-fibre function only. Laser pulses selectively excite free nerve endings in the superficial skin layers and evoke Adelta-related brain potentials (LEPs).

LEPs often disclosed subclinical dysfunction of Adelta fibres and proved a sensitive and reliable diagnostic tool for assessing small-fibre function in sensory neuropathy. [References: 24]",Excluded
4195,"Spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties: implications for elevated cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure Evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and diminished in astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were isolated from 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for in vitro vascular and mechanical testing. Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were lower and vascular distensibility greater in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice (n=7) relative to ground-based control group (GC) mice (n=12). Basilar artery maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236+/-9 mum and GC: 215+/-5 mum) with no difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4+/-1.6 mum; GC: 12.2+/-1.2 mum). Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized via nanoindentation, was lower in SF mice (SF: 3.4+/-0.3 N/m; GC: 5.4+/-0.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of perfusion could contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an associated impairment of visual acuity in astronauts during spaceflight.",Included

A recommended diagnostic workup Background: Patients admitted for suspicion of shunt dysfunction (SD) often show unspecific symptoms and require time-consuming, expensive and even invasive diagnostics involving significant radiation exposure. The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the current diagnostic procedures and to propose a process optimisation. Method(s): As all patients admitted for suspicion of SD receive imaging studies, we searched for adult patients receiving neuroimaging in the period from January 2010 to July 2013, analysing referring diagnosis, clinical signs, products, diagnostic process and final diagnosis. Recursive partitioning was used to define time intervals for differentiating types of SD. Result(s): A total of 148 patients, aged 18-89 (mean, 54) years, were studied. Forty-two percent were referred by a hospital or rehabilitation centre, 30% by general practitioners and 24% were self-referrals. The admission diagnosis was in the majority ""shunt dysfunction"" only. Further differentiations were rarely made. An SD was confirmed in 46% of the patients. In 17%, the symptoms were based on another cause and in 37% they could not be clearly attributed to any specific disorder. Abdominal dislocations (2%) and shunt infections (5%) were found within the first 6 months. Over- (3%) and under-drainage (14%) were the most frequent complications during the first 4 years. Disconnections (13%) occurred generally 4 years or more after implantation. Only shunt obstruction (9%) showed no temporal pattern. Conclusion(s): Symptoms of SD remain mostly unspecific. This study showed that the type of SD depends on the time interval from implantation. We propose a workup strategy for patients with SD based on the temporal profile.

4257,"Astroglial swelling in the neuronal depolarization ensemble The coupling between neuronal depolarization and astroglial swelling was examined. First, previous in vitro data for the swelling of cultured neurons (N18; rat neuroblastoma) and astroglia (C6; rat astroglyoma) upon exposure to a hypoosmotic solution were reappraised. Neurons swelled rapidly, forming blisters, and easily burst. whereas astroglia resisted swelling and slowly assumed a large full-moon shape. The time constant of swelling was 35.2 +/- 7.8 s for N18 and 594.8 +/- 554.0 s for C6. The glial plasmic membrane was found to be much stronger than the neuronal one, presumably due to a well-developed cytoskeleton. To overcome such neuronal membranous weakness, strong astroglial processes need to cover the neurons including the cell body and synapses, as demonstrated electron-microscopically. Next, in situ astroglial swelling was investigated in rats. During K(+)-induced cortical spreading depression, increases or decreases of a wave-ring spread of light (550 nm) transmission through a 1 mm-thick cerebral cortical layer was observed. The moving local optical density decrease in the cortex was attributable to local vascular bed compression induced by astroglial swelling, since concomitant occurrence of colocated dynamic capillary flow stall was confirmed by a hemodilution technique. Astroglial swelling may occur in an ensemble acting during neuronal depolarization, suggesting that neurons and astroglia behave like a unit complex.",Excluded

The locator group underwent lumbar pedicle screw placement using the intradermal locator. The control group was aided by traditional fluoroscopy. Baseline demographics, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, operation time, intraoperative fluoroscopy time and guidewire insertion time were recorded. All postoperative CT scans were reviewed by an independent spine surgeon to grade screw placement accuracy.RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (180 screws) were assigned to the locator group and 30 patients (128 screws) to the control group. The locator device could significantly reduce the fluoroscopy time [3.9 sec (SD = 1.9) vs. 9.6 sec (SD = 5.8), p < 0.001] and guidewire insertion time [2.69 min (SD = 0.67) vs. 4.49 min (SD = 1.96), p < 0.001] compared with the conventional method for each pedicle screw.

In particular, the role of apoptosis in both normal and abnormal neuronal development and maturation will be examined with especial reference to the induction of apoptotic cell death following abusive ligand- induced ion movements. The interaction of oxidant stress and immediate-early response gene activation is discussed with further reference to the induction of apoptosis. While glutamate receptor activation appears mandatory for coordinate maturation and neuritogenesis, such neuronal survival and differentiation is intimately dependent upon the intracellular glutathione redox potential, maintained by cystine uptake.

Previously, high doses of one of the boron compounds used for BNCT, L-BPA, were found to reduce the boron-derived irradiation dose to the central nervous system. However, injection with a high dose of L-BPA is not feasible in clinical settings. We aimed to find an alternative method to improve the therapeutic efficacy of this therapy. We examined the effects of oral preloading with various analogues of L-BPA in a xenograft tumour model and found that high-dose L-phenylalanine reduced the accumulation of L-BPA in the normal brain relative to tumour tissue. As a result, the maximum irradiation dose in the normal brain was 19.2% lower in the L-phenylalanine group relative to the control group. This study provides a simple strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of conventional boron compounds for BNCT for brain tumours and the possibility to widen the indication of BNCT to various kinds of other tumours.

Selecting appropriate treatment remains a challenging problem for orthopedic physicians. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical effects of minimally invasive adjustable plate and locking compression plate in treatment of unstable pelvic fractures via posterior approach.METHODS: From January 2009 to June 2012, fifty-six patients with unstable pelvic fractures were included. After at least 12-month follow-up, forty-four patients treated with two methods were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups: minimally invasive adjustable plate (group A) and locking compression plate (group B). Preoperative and postoperative radiography was taken to assess the fracture displacement and reduction quality. The size of incision, operation duration, blood loss, duration of X-ray exposures, Majeed postoperative functional evaluation and Lindahl postoperative reduction evaluation were analyzed.RESULTS: The mean follow-up in group A was 27.3 months (range, 13-48 months), and that in group B was 21.8 months (range, 12-42 months). There were no iatrogenic neurovascular injuries during the operations in the two groups. In group B, malunion was observed in one patient, and infection of incision was observed in one case. The operation duration, blood loss, and size of incision of group A were significantly less than that of group B. There was no significant difference in the duration of X-ray exposures between the two groups. The Majeed functional evaluation score in group A was significantly higher than that in group B. The difference of the imaging score of the retained displacement was not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Both the two methods can effectively stabilize the unstable pelvic fractures. However, the minimally invasive adjustable plate has the advantages of minimally invasive, less radiation exposure, technically safe and time saving. Minimally invasive adjustable plate is a good supplementary option for treating posterior pelvic ring injuries.",Excluded
3977,"Comparison of Neutron Organ and Effective Dose Coefficients for PIMAL Stylized Phantoms in Bent Postures in Cranial and Caudal Irradiation Geometries ABSTRACT: Radiation dose estimations in the human body are performed using computational reference phantoms, which are anatomical representations of the human body. In previous studies, dose reconstructions have been performed focusing primarily on phantoms in an upright posture, which limits the accuracy of the dose estimations for postures observed in realistic work settings. In this work, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 103 recommendations for monoenergetic neutron plane sources directed downward from above the head (cranial) and upward from below the feet (caudal) for adult female and male reference phantoms were used to calculate organ absorbed and effective dose coefficients. The Phantom with Moving Arms and Legs (PIMAL) and the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) radiation transport code were used to compute organ-absorbed dose and effective dose coefficients for the upright, half-bent (45degree), and full-bent (90degree) phantom postures. The doses calculated for each of the articulated positions were compared to those calculated for the upright posture by computing the ratios of the coefficients (45degree/upright and 90degree/upright). These ratios were used to assess the effectiveness of upright phantoms in providing a comparable estimate when conducting dose estimations and dose reconstructions for articulated positions. This work compiling neutron cranial and caudal posture-specific dose coefficients completes the series of dose coefficients computed for posture-specific ICRP Publication 116 irradiation geometries for monoenergetic photons and neutrons, in addition to cranial and caudal monoenergetic photons. Results reported demonstrated that organ-absorbed dose coefficients for most of the organs in the CRA and CAU irradiation geometries were significantly higher for the bent phantoms than for the upright phantom. Since the upright phantom underestimates the organ-absorbed dose, this demonstrates the impact of posture while performing dose calculations. Organ doses reported in past neutron dose coefficient data were found to omit effects from neutron resonances at energies of 0.435, 1.0, and 3.21 MeV from 16O in tissue. Reported data notes as high as 60% underestimation for neutron organ-absorbed doses, specifically at the neutron resonance energy region omitted by smoothing. Ongoing studies are examining the effect of resonances on reported neutron organ-absorbed dose coefficients in ICRP 116 geometries.",Excluded

Histopathology showed post-transplantation primary central nervous system lymphoma, with cells positive for B-cell marker CD20. Immunosuppressant was stopped and she was treated with radiotherapy and rituximab (anti- CD20 monoclonal antibody). She remained diseasefree at 16 months. Post-transplantation primary central nervous system lymphoma is rare with variable presentation and radiological features. We believe rituximab may have a role in the treatment of such lymphomas.

4664,"A Multi-institutional Prospective Observational Study of Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Patients With Multiple Brain Metastases (JLGK0901 Study Update): Irradiation-related Complications and Long-term Maintenance of Mini-Mental State Examination Scores PURPOSE: The JLGK0901 study showed the noninferiority of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone as initial treatment of 5 to 10 brain metastases (BMs) compared with 2 to 4 BMs in terms of overall survival and most secondary endpoints (Lancet Oncol 2014;15:387-95). However, observation periods were not long enough to allow confirmation of the long-term safety of SRS alone in patients with 5 to 10 BMs.METHODS AND MATERIALS: This was a prospective observational study of Gamma Knife SRS-treated patients with 1 to 10 newly diagnosed BMs enrolled at 23 facilities between March 1, 2009, and February 15, 2012.RESULTS: The 1194 eligible patients were categorized into the following groups: group A, 1 tumor (n=455); group B, 2 to 4 tumors (n=531); and group C, 5 to 10 tumors (n=208). Cumulative rates of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score maintenance (MMSE score decrease <3 from baseline) determined with a competing risk analysis of groups A, B, and C were 93%, 91%, and 92%, respectively, at the 12th month after SRS; 91%, 89%, and 91%, respectively, at the 24th month; 89%, 88%, and 89%, respectively, at the 36th month; and 87%, 86%, and 89%, respectively, at the 48th month (hazard ratio [HR] of group A vs group B, 0.719; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.437-1.172; P=.18; HR of group B vs group C, 1.280; 95% CI, 0.696-2.508; P=.43). During observations ranging from 0.3 to 67.5 months (median, 12.0 months; interquartile range, 5.8-26.5 months), as of December 2014, 145 patients (12.1%) had SRS-induced complications. Cumulative complication incidences by competing risk analysis for groups A, B, and C were 7%, 8%, and 6%, respectively, at the 12th month after SRS; 10%, 11%, and 11%, respectively, at the 24th month; 11%, 11%, and 12%, respectively, at the 36th month; and 12%, 12%, and 13%, respectively, at the 48th month (HR of group A vs group B, 0.850; 95% CI, 0.592-1.220; P=.38; HR of group B vs group C, 1.052; 95% CI, 0.666-1.662, P=.83). Leukoencephalopathy occurred in 12 of the 1074 patients (1.1%) with follow-up magnetic resonance imaging and was detected after salvage whole-brain radiation therapy in 11 of these 12 patients. In these 11 patients, leukoencephalopathy was detected by magnetic resonance imaging 5.2 to 21.2 months (median, 11.0 months; interquartile range, 7.0-14.4 months) after whole-brain radiation therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Neither MMSE score maintenance nor post-SRS complication incidence differed among groups A, B, and C. This longer-term follow-up study further supports the already-reported noninferiority hypothesis of SRS alone for patients with 5 to 10 BMs versus 2 to 4 BMs.",Excluded

4283,"Limited disease small cell lung cancer: alternating combination of doxorubicin, etoposide, ifosfamide and hyperfractionated radiotherapy. Final results of a multicentric pilot study for the Groupe Lyonnias d'Oncologie Thoracique (GLOT) In order to evaluate the effect on prolonging survival of alternating chemotherapy and radiotherapy schedules in patients with limited disease small cell lung cancer, 89 patients were included in a multi-institutional pilot study between January 1986 and May 1989. Treatment consisted of induction chemotherapy using the combination of doxorubicin, etoposide and ifosfamide (AVI) for four consecutive courses, followed by two cycles of the VI chemotherapy alternating with three hyperfractionated radiotherapy courses and then followed by two additional courses of AVI. Objective response to the four cycles of AVI combination was observed in 65 patients (75%). Thirteen out of 30 patients (44%) who were in partial response (PR) after induction chemotherapy were converted into complete response (CR) after the three alternating courses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The principal side effect related to combined modality treatment was acute radiation pneumonitis (21.5% cases) reversible except one which resulted in toxic death, and a second with chronic lung fibrosis with permanent WHO Grade 2 dyspnea (14%). Local relapse was observed in 47% of the patients who were considered in CR at the end of the treatment program and cerebral metastases were the first site of detectable relapse in 25% cases. The 3-year actuarial disease-free survival of the 89 patients is 5%, and the median actuarial survival is 14 months. This study shows that the promising survival rates seen in our previously published interim analysis were not maintained. Reasons for this might include the choice of a non cisplatinum containing induction chemotherapy, the late introduction of thoracic irradiation and/or to the use of non-restrictive criteria for selecting patients.",Excluded

We undertook radical release of the left-sided trismus, and covered the resultant soft tissue defect with an anterolateral thigh free flap, but the patient was only able to open his mouth an interincisal distance of 8 mm. The right mandible was accessed and the functionless residual teeth were extracted. Marginal mandibulectomy of the native mandible was performed.RESULTS: Dental implants (POI, Kyocera, Japan) were inserted into the leveled right mandible. A bridge dental prosthesis was inserted and resulted in a final functional interincisal distance of 19 mm.CONCLUSION: We offer that leveling the native mandible to match the reconstructed side is a simple procedure that can be reasonably used as an alternative measure in a selected group of patients.",Excluded

4725,"Nonlinear modeling of auditory-nerve rate responses to wideband stimuli The spectral selectivity of auditory nerve fibers was characterized by a method based on responses to random-spectrum-shape stimuli. The method models the average discharge rate of fibers for steady stimuli and is based on responses to approximately 100 noise-like stimuli with pseudorandom spectral levels in 1/8- or 1/16-octave frequency bins. The model assumes that rate is determined by a linear weighting of the spectrum plus a second-order weighting of all pairs of spectrum values within a certain frequency range of best frequency. The method allows prediction of rate responses to stimuli with arbitrary wideband spectral shapes, thus providing a direct test of the degree of linearity of spectral processing Auditory-nerve fibers are shown to rely mainly on linear weighting of the stimulus spectrum; however, significant second-order terms are present and are important in predicting responses to random-spectrum shape stimuli, although not for predicting responses to noise filtered with cat head-related transfer functions. The second-order terms weight the products of levels at identical frequencies positively and the products of different frequencies negatively. As such, they model both curvature in the rate versus level function and suppressive interactions between different frequency components. The first- and second-order characterizations derived in this method provide a measure of higher-order nonlinearities in neurons, albeit without providing information about temporal characteristics.",Excluded
3947,"Spatial learning and memory deficits induced by exposure to iron-56-particle radiation It has previously been shown that exposing rats to particles of high energy and charge (HZE) disrupts the functioning of the dopaminergic system and behaviors mediated by this system, such as motor performance and an amphetamine-induced conditioned taste aversion; these adverse behavioral and neuronal effects are similar to those seen in aged animals. Because cognition declines with age, spatial learning and memory were assessed in the Morris water maze 1 month after whole-body irradiation with 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/nucleon high-energy (56)Fe particles, to test the cognitive behavioral consequences of radiation exposure. Irradiated rats demonstrated cognitive impairment compared to the control group as seen in their increased latencies to find the hidden platform, particularly on the reversal day when the platform was moved to the opposite quadrant. Also, the irradiated group used nonspatial strategies during the probe trials (swim with no platform), i.e. less time spent in the platform quadrant, fewer crossings of and less time spent in the previous platform location, and longer latencies to the previous platform location. These findings are similar to those seen in aged rats, suggesting that an increased release of reactive oxygen species may be responsible for the induction of radiation- and age-related cognitive deficits. If these decrements in behavior also occur in humans, they may impair the ability of astronauts to perform critical tasks during long-term space travel beyond the magnetosphere.",Included
3898,"Concurrent temozolomide and radiation in elderly patients with glioblastoma: A retrospective analysis Purpose/Objective(s): Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Radiation with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide is well tolerated and significantly improves survival. In studying this treatment approach, patients >=70 years of age have rarely been included. Here we examine the potential benefit of concurrent temozolomide in patients >=70. Materials/Methods: Retrospective chart review of patient records treated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) between January 1, 2004 and January 1, 2010, with radiation (XRT) for GBM with or without temozolomide. Analysis was limited to patients >= 70 years of age with GBM, who received XRT at MDACC, had no previous chemotherapy or XRT for their diagnosis, and had no prior grade 1-3 glioma diagnosis. Of 170 patients >=70 years old at the time of histopathologic diagnosis of GBM by either biopsy or resection, 51 met these criteria, (median age 75, range 70- 87). Extent of tumor resection was evaluated by surgical reports and immediate postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval between initial GBM diagnosis to death or last follow-up. Progression free survival (PFS) was calculated as interval between diagnosis and documented progression or death. Overall median follow up was 7 months (0-43), with median of 4 months (0-31) in the XRT only group, and 10 months (1-43) in the XRT + temozolomide group. Survival differences were calculated via the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log rank statistics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using Cox-regression analysis. This study was reviewed and approved by the MDACC Internal Review Board. Result(s): On univariate analysis, the following variables were significantly associated with overall survival: Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) (<80 vs >= 80 p = 0.039), radiation dose (<= 50 Gy vs > 50 Gy, p = 0.013), concurrent temozolomide (p = 0.006) and extent of surgery (biopsy vs subtotal resection vs gross total resection, p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis, extent of surgery, concurrent temozolamide and XRT dose were associated with improved OS (p=0.003). Median OS for the population was 8 months (<1-43). OS in those patients treated with XRT alone was 5 months vs 11 months in those patients receiving XRT and temozolomide (p =0.004). Median progression free survival was 5 months (<1-28) with no significant difference (p =0.164) between treatment groups. Conclusion(s):With short follow up, temozolomide in addition to radiation therapy is associated with improved overall survival in patients withGBM>=70 years. This prompts further prospective study to evaluate the effects of age, health status and fractionation on survival and quality of life in the elderly patient with GBM.",Excluded
3985,"Thoracic radiotherapy of SCLC Limited stage: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) comprises 10-15% of all lung tumors and is associated with an aggressive clinical behavior. Two out of three patients presents with hematogenous metastases at diagnosis (extensive stage (ES)). For patients without hematogenous metastases (limited stage (LS)), chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment. Although radiotherapy after chemotherapy has the theoretical benefit of treating smaller target volumes with less toxicity, concurrent chemoradiotherapy has shown to be superior. Moreover, earlier use of radiotherapy during chemotherapy leads to better results. The absolute benefit of early versus late radiotherapy was about 10% for patients who had received cisplatinum-based chemotherapy.1 Turrisi et al.2 demonstrated that twice daily radiotherapy starting with a first course of chemotherapy resulted in improved survival rates. Median survival was 23 months for patients who received twice-daily radiotherapy (45 Gy/30 fractions/3 weeks) versus 19 months for once daily treated patients (45 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks). The corresponding 5 years survival rates were 26% and 16%. However, more Grade 3-4 oesophagitis was seen during twice-daily treatment (32% versus 16%). Only a minority of patients in the US and Europe receive twice daily radiotherapy. Recently the results of the CONVERT trial, in which once-daily radiotherapy (70Gy) was compared with twice daily radiotherapy (45 Gy) were presented.3 Radiotherapy was initiated at the 2nd course of 4-6 cycles of cisplatin/etoposide. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two arms. Overall survival at 2 years was 56% for patients treated twice-daily versus 51% for patients treated once-daily (p= 0.15).3 There was also no significant difference in time to progression. There were no differences in a acute toxicity, except for Grade 3-4 neutropenia, which occurred more often in the twicedaily treatment arm (74% versus 65%). There were no differences in Grade 3-5 oesophagitis (19%) and pneumonitis (2%). The authors concluded that survival in both study arms was higher than reported previously and that radiation related toxicities were lower than expected, probably related to the use of modern radiotherapy techniques. The results of the study support the use of either twice daily or once daily as standard of care for patients with limited stage disease and in good performance score. In RTOG0538 study, which also compares 70 Gy once-daily and 45 Gy twice-daily radiotherapy, radiotherapy commences with the first or second course of chemotherapy. The results of this study are eagerly awaited.4 Extensive stage: In the EORTC study on prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for ES-SCLC, it was noted that the vast majority of patients still had intrathoracic disease after completion of chemotherapy. After on the positive effects of PCI which not only reduced the risk of symptomatic brain metastases (40 versus 15%) but also improved overall survival (1 year: 27 versus 13% (P= 0,003)),5 the next logical step was to investigate the use of thoracic radiotherapy in ES-SCLC as well. Evidence for a possible role of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) in ESSCLC also comes from the results of a trial published by Jeremic et al. in 19996 in which patients with ES-SCLC and good prognosis with a complete response outside the thorax were randomized between TRT plus PCI during chemotherapy versus chemotherapy and PCI only. Overall survival was 17 months for the patients who received thoracic radiotherapy versus 11 months for those who did not. In the CREST trial, patients with ES-SCLC and any response after 4-6 cycles of platinum based chemotherapy were randomized between PCI plus TRT (30Gy/10 fractions) or PCI only. Overall survival at one year, the primary endpoint of the study, was not statistically significant between the groups (p=0.066) but with longer follow up the survival curves diverged and at 2 years, survival was 13% in patients who received TRT versus 3% in the controls (p=0,004). There was also significant dif erence in progression free survival. In an additional analysis of patients with and without residual intrathoracic disease, which was one of the stratification factors of the study, it was demonstrated that there was no significant benefit of TRT in patients with a CR in the thorax. However, in patients with residual intrathoracic disease after chemotherapy, TRT led to a significant improvement in overall survival. 7 In patients who received thoracic radiotherapy the risk of intrathoracic recurrence was reduced from 80% to 44%. In patients who received thoracic radiotherapy the most recurrences occurred outside the brain and the thorax and at a later stage. The next logical step after demonstration of a beneficial effect of PCI and TRT would be the use of higher doses for TRT and possibly also treatment of extrathoracic metastatic sites. This topic was addressed in the NRG-RTOG0937 study and was presented at ASTRO 2015.8 patients with ES-SCLC and a CR or PR after chemotherapy and 1-4 metastatic lesions were randomized between PCI or PCI plus TRT plus radiotherapy of metastatic sites. The study which accrued very slowly was closed early due to observed toxicities. The study did not show a survival difference between the two groups, but included only 86 patients over a five years period and had imbalance groups with worse prognostic factors in the experimental arm. There were many, partly unrelated, Grade 4-5 toxicities in the experimental arm. To define which patients are most likely to benefit from a more aggressive approach we have performed an additional analysis for patients from the top accruing centers from the CREST trial. An evaluation of 260 patients showed significantly better outcome in patients with 0 to 2 metastases versus and without liver metastases.10 These patients are believed to be best candidates for future studies.",Excluded
3968,"Optimizing cancer radiotherapy with 2-deoxy-D-glucose: Dose escalation studies in patients with glioblastoma multiforme Background and Purpose: Higher rates of glucose utilization and glycolysis generally correlate with poor prognosis in several types of malignant tumors. Own earlier studies on model systems demonstrated that the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) could enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy in a dose-dependent manner by selectively sensitizing cancer cells while protecting normal cells. Phase I/II clinical trials indicated that the combination of 2-DG, at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg body weight (BW), with large fractions of gamma-radiation was well tolerated in cerebral glioma patients. Since higher 2-DG doses are expected to improve the therapeutic gain, present studies were undertaken to examine the tolerance and safety of escalating 2-DG dose during combined treatment (2-DG + radiotherapy) in glioblastoma multiforme patients. Patients and Methods: Untreated patients with histologically proven glioblastoma multiforme (WHO criteria) were included in the study. Seven weekly fractions of <sup>60</sup>Co gamma-rays (5 Gy/fraction) were delivered to the tumor volume (presurgical CT/MRI evaluation) plus 3 cm margin. Escalating 2-DG doses (200-250-300 mg/kg BW) were administered orally 30 min before irradiation after overnight fasting. Acute toxicity and tolerance were studied by monitoring the vital parameters and side effects. Late radiation damage and treatment responses were studied radiologically and clinically in surviving patients. Result(s): Transient side effects similar to hypoglycemia were observed in most of the patients. Tolerance and patient compliance to the combined treatment were very good up to a 2-DG dose of 250 mg/kg BW. However, at the higher dose of 300 mg/kg BW, two out of six patients were very restless and could not complete treatment, though significant changes in the vital parameters were not observed even at this dose. No significant damage to the normal brain tissue was observed during follow-up in seven out of ten patients who received complete treatment and survived between 11 and 46 months after treatment. Conclusion(s): Oral administration of 2-DG combined with large fractions of radiation (5 Gy/fraction/week) is safe and could be tolerated in glioblastoma patients without any acute toxicity and late radiation damage to the normal brain. Further clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of the combined treatment are warranted. Â© Urban & Vogel.",Excluded

4156,"Investigating the impact of mobile range electromagnetic radiation on the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat during working memory Research has been focused on the effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) emitted from a mobile phone on general health, especially the nervous system. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of RF-EMR on the brain mechanism of rats by recording local field potentials (LFPs) signals during working memory (WM) task. Subjects were exposed to 900 MHz from a dipole antenna daily for three hours. Exposure was applied, first on a short term base (1 week) and then on a long term base (4 weeks). Behavioral parameters were measured weekly while rats performed T-maze tasks in two types of normal and delayed. LFPs signals were simultaneously recorded by implanted microelectrode arrays on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats. Results showed a significant increase (*p < 0.05) in the task completion time of exposed rats which vanished shortly after the end of short term RF-EMR exposure. Before exposure, during correctly performed delayed tasks, an increase (peak) in power changes of theta band (4-12 Hz) was observed. But during correctly performed normal tasks, an increase appeared only by applying RF-EMR exposure. The similarity in power changes pattern of theta band in both types of tasks was observed after long term exposure. Classification accuracy of LFPs in truly done normal and delayed tasks was compared in pre and post-exposure states. Initial classification accuracy was 84.2 % which decreased significantly (*P < 0.05) after exposure. These observations indicated that RF-EMR may cause unusual brain functioning which is temporary at least for short term exposure. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
4801,"Differentiation between glioma and radiation necrosis using molecular magnetic resonance imaging of endogenous proteins and peptides It remains difficult to distinguish tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis after brain tumor therapy. Here we show that these lesions can be distinguished using the amide proton transfer (APT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals of endogenous cellular proteins and peptides as an imaging biomarker. When comparing two models of orthotopic glioma (SF188/V+ glioma and 9L gliosarcoma) with a model of radiation necrosis in rats, we could clearly differentiate viable glioma (hyperintense) from radiation necrosis (hypointense to isointense) by APT MRI. When we irradiated rats with U87MG gliomas, the APT signals in the irradiated tumors had decreased substantially by 3 d and 6 d after radiation. The amide protons that can be detected by APT provide a unique and noninvasive MRI biomarker for distinguishing viable malignancy from radiation necrosis and predicting tumor response to therapy.",Excluded

Given concerns regarding excess radiation exposure and financial burden, our aim was to develop a prognostic score for disease recurrence to guide individually tailored surveillance strategies.METHODS: All patients with primary nonfunctioning, nonmetastatic well/moderately differentiated PanNETs who underwent curative-intent resection at 9-institutions from 2000 to 2016 were included (n = 1006). A Recurrence Risk Score (RRS) was developed from a randomly selected derivation cohort comprised of 67% of patients and verified on the validation-cohort comprised of the remaining 33%.RESULTS: On multivariable analysis, patients within the derivation cohort (n = 681) with symptomatic tumors (jaundice, pain, bleeding), tumors >2 cm, Ki67 >3%, and lymph node (LN) (+) disease had increased recurrence. Each factor was assigned a score based on their weighted odds ratio that formed a RRS of 0 to 10: symptomatic = 1, tumor >2 cm = 2, Ki67 3% to 20% = 1, Ki67 >20% = 6, LN (+) = 1. Patients were grouped into low- (RRS = 0-2; n = 247), intermediate-(RRS = 3-5; n = 204), or high (RRS = 6-10; n = 9)-risk groups. At 24 months, 33% of high RRS recurred, whereas only 2% of low and 14% of intermediate RRS recurred. This persisted in the validation cohort (n = 325).CONCLUSIONS: This international, novel, internally validated RRS accurately stratifies recurrence-free survival for patients with resected PanNETs. Given their unique recurrence patterns, surveillance intervals of 12, 6, and 3 months are proposed for low, intermediate, and high RRS patients, respectively, to minimize radiation exposure and optimize cost/resource utilization.",Excluded

The effects on tumour growth, the efficiency of i.a. infusion, the efficacy of retention of microspheres in the primary tumour and the excretion of free holmium-166 were analyzed. Complete tumour remissions were obtained in 79% and 86% following embolization with radioactive and inactive microspheres, respectively. Over 95% of the microspheres were retained in the tumour and the leaching of holmium-166 in urine and faeces was less than 0.1% in 2 days. The injection efficiency was not optimal, as 40% of the microspheres were retained in the cannulation system. Arterio-arteriolar connections should be detected and closed prior to embolization to prevent stray emboli from entering the brain. It is concluded that 166HoPLA microspheres are promising candidates for further studies on radio-embolization of unresectable head-and-neck cancer.",Excluded
3930,"Analysis of treatment outcome after stereotactic radiosurgery for cavernous sinus meningiomas OBJECT: The long-term outcome of stereotactic radiosurgery for cavernous sinus (CS) meningiomas is not fully understood. The authors retrospectively reviewed their experience with 40 CS meningiomas treated with gamma knife radiosurgery.METHODS: Follow-up periods for the 40 patients ranged from 12 to 123 months (median 42 months), and the overall tumor control rates were 86.4% at 3 years and 82.3% at 10 years. Factors associated with tumor recurrence in univariate analysis were histological malignancy (p < 0.0001), partial treatment (p < 0.0001), suprasellar tumor extension (p = 0.0201), or extension in more than three directions outside the CS (p = 0.0345). When the tumor was completely covered with a dose to the margin that was higher than 14 Gy (Group A, 22 patients), no patient showed recurrence within the median follow-up period of 37 months. On the other hand, when a part of the tumor was treated with 10 to 12 Gy (Group B, 15 patients) or did not receive radiation therapy (Group C, three patients), the recurrence rates were 20% and 100%, respectively. Neurological deterioration was seen in nine patients, but all symptoms were transient or very mild.CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that stereotactic radiosurgery can control tumor growth if the whole mass can be irradiated by dosages of more than 14 Gy. When optimal radiosurgical planning is not feasible because of a tumor's large size, irregular shape, or proximity to visual pathways, use of limited surgical resection before radiosurgery is the best option and should provide sufficient long-term tumor control with minimal complications.",Excluded
4831,"Patient dosimetric evaluation in angiography practice: Application in interventional neuroradiology Purpose: To evaluate the risk of a deterministic skin injury from Interventional Radiology (IR) procedures, the Peak Skin Dose (PSD) and the skin dose mapping should be estimate. Dose metrics commonly available such as cumulative air kerma at the interventional reference point (Ka,irp) are usually employed. However, as the PSD may be substantially different from Ka,irp, it is necessary to estimate the PSD and skin dose mapping more accurately. Material(s) and Method(s): A custom made MatLab code has been developed; its output is the PSD and a visual display of the surface dose mapped onto a spherical or cylindrical phantom modeling the head or the trunk of the patient respectively. The code works by translating the Ka,irp (corrected by back-scatter factor) to the location of the patient's skin, represented by a surface of the geometrical model and using dosimetric and geometric parameters (primary and secondary angles of the two tubes, longitudinal displacement of the bed) for each radiation event stored in the radiation dose structured report (RDSR). The setting of the dimension of the geometrical phantom depends on the anatomical size of the patient measured from images stored during IR procedures. To validate the code, arrays of thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were placed on the phantom surface and on the skin of 9 patients undergoing neuroendovascular treatments, both cerebral and spinal (Artis zee biplane, Siemens). Result(s): The Ka,irp provided by the Angiography System overestimates the measured PSD by more than 50% for head treatments. The percent difference between the PSD calculated and measured by TLD is within 35%. The skin dose mapped on the surface of the geometrical model is in agreement with the dose distribution measured by TLD. Conclusion(s): In Neuro-IR, the use of more detailed information from RDSR can improve the accuracy of the calculated PSD. The implemented algorithm can be applied to evaluate the PSD and skin dose mapping without direct dosimetry. Copyright Â© 2016",Excluded

The extensive distribution of soltriol nuclear receptor cells, revealed by autoradiography with tritium-labeled 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol (vitamin D, soltriol) and related effects, indicate an involvement of vitamin D-soltriol in the actinic induction of seasonal biorhythms. This is considered to be independent of the traditionally assigned effects of vitamin D on systemic calcium regulation. Skin-soltriol mediated seasonal, and to a degree daily, genomic activation involves many target regions in the brain. These include neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala, in the linked part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, in periventricular hypothalamic neurons, dorsal raphe nucleus, reticular thalamic nucleus and autonomic, endocrine as well as sensory and motor components of the brainstem and spinal cord. Additional to the eye-regulated ""suprachiasmatic clock"", existence of a soltriol-vitamin D regulated neural ""timing circuit(s)"" is proposed. Both, activational and organizational effects of soltriol on mature and developing brain regions, respectively are likely to play a role in the regulation of neuronal functions that include the modulation and entrainment of biorhythms. Soltriol's central effects correlate with peripheral effects on elements in skin, bone, teeth, kidney, intestine, heart and blood vessels, endocrine organs, and tissues of the immune and reproductive system.

4706,"Sensory neuron sodium current requires nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone during development Development of the embryonic nervous system requires thyroid hormone. However, the underlying mechanisms and targets of thyroid hormone action are not well defined. To identify embryonic roles for thyroid hormone we tested for effects on a key neuronal trait, voltage-gated sodium current (I(Na)), in the zebrafish model system. We recorded from Rohon-Beard sensory neurons (RBs) using whole cell voltage-clamp methods. Here, we provide in vivo evidence for thyroid hormone regulation of I(Na). Chronic thyroid hormone application increased RB peak I(Na) density 1.4-fold. However, I(Na) density showed a similar increase within 5 min of an acute hormone application, a time course not expected for a genomic mechanism. Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), a thyroid hormone blocker, blocked both chronic and acute effects. Further, the thyroid hormone precursor thyroxine (T4) affected I(Na), yet the traditionally active form triiodothyronine did not. Consequently, we tested for a nonconventional T4 receptor. LM609, a selective antagonist of integrin alphaVbeta3, occluded the rapid effect of T4, implicating a specific integrin dimer as a T4 receptor. Chronic application of either tetrac or LM609 significantly reduced sodium conductance, demonstrating an in vivo requirement for T4-integrin regulation of I(Na). Further, removing endogenous T4 levels via yolkectomy reduced sodium conductance, an effect that was partially rescued by T4 supplementation following surgery. Because RBs mediate the embryonic touch response, we tested for behavioral effects. Tetrac and LM609 significantly reduced the percentage of touch trials eliciting a normal touch response. T4's rapid effect on RB I(Na) highlights the importance of embryonic T4 availability and nongenomic T4 signaling.",Excluded

4728,"Serine/threonine kinase BUB1 promotes proliferation and radio-resistance in glioblastoma BUB1 (Budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1), a mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase, has been linked in numerous cancers to pro-tumorigenic phenomena including elevation of cellular proliferation, tumor growth, metastatic potential, and poorer patient prognosis. However, the role of BUB1 in glioblastoma remains poorly investigated. In this study, clinical analyses determined significant enrichment of BUB1 in glioblastoma with direct correlation of elevated expression to poorer prognosis in glioma patients. Genetic inhibition of BUB1 in glioblastoma tumor cells via shRNA silencing diminished both proliferative ability and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of BUB1 was additionally determined to promote the cytotoxic effect of irradiation on glioblastoma tumor cells, and investigation of the underlying pathways revealed the roles of DNA mismatch repair, spliceosome and c-Myc pathways. Mechanistically, FOXM1 was determined to positively regulate transcription of BUB1 via direct promoter region binding. For validation, pharmacologic inhibition through administration of a BUB1 inhibitor demonstrated attenuated glioblastoma cellular proliferation in vitro as well as delayed tumor growth with prolonged survival in vivo. Collectively, this study demonstrates a novel therapeutic target for glioblastoma in the form of BUB1, which plays a pivotal role in GBM proliferative and radio-resistance capacities in a FOXM1-dependant manner.",Excluded
4083,"Reducing the dosimetric impact of positional errors in field junctions for craniospinal irradiation using VMAT AIM: To improve treatment plan robustness with respect to small shifts in patient position during the VMAT treatment by ensuring a linear ramp-like dose profile in treatment field overlap regions.BACKGROUND: Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is considered technically challenging because the target size exceeds the maximal field size, which necessitates using abutted or overlapping treatment fields. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is increasingly being examined for CSI, as it offers both better dose homogeneity and better dose conformance while also offering a possibility to create field junctions which are more robust towards small shifts in patient position during the treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A VMAT treatment plan with three isocenters was made for a test case patient. Three groups of overlapping arc field pairs were used; one for the cranial and two for the spinal part. In order to assure a ramp-like dose profile in the field overlap region, the upper spinal part was optimised first, with dose prescription explicitly enforcing a ramp-like dose profile. The cranial and lower spinal part were done afterwards, taking into account the dose contribution of the upper spinal fields.RESULTS: Using simple geometrical reasoning, we demonstrated that hot- and cold spots which arise from small displacement of one treatment field relative to the other treatment field can be reduced by taking two precautions: (a) widening the field overlap region, and (b) reducing the field gradient across the overlap region. The function with the smallest maximal gradient is a linear ramp. We present a treatment planning technique which yields the desired dose profile of the two contributing fields, and minimises dosimetric dependence on minor positional errors in patient set-up.",Excluded

There is little information, however, about the direct effect of night work on the risk of cancer. We investigated the effect of night work in breast cancer.METHODS: We examined the relationship between breast cancer and working on rotating night shifts during 10 years of follow-up in 78 562 women from the Nurses' Health Study. Information was ascertained in 1988 about the total number of years during which the nurses had worked rotating night shifts with at least three nights per month. From June 1988 through May 1998, we documented 2441 incident breast cancer cases. Logistic regression models were used to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for confounding variables and breast cancer risk factors. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: We observed a moderate increase in breast cancer risk among the women who worked 1-14 years or 15-29 years on rotating night shifts (multivariate adjusted RR = 1.08 [95% CI = 0.99 to 1.18] and RR = 1.08 [95% CI = 0.90 to 1.30], respectively). The risk was further increased among women who worked 30 or more years on the night shift (RR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.78). The test for trend was statistically significant (P =.02).CONCLUSIONS: Women who work on rotating night shifts with at least three nights per month, in addition to days and evenings in that month, appear to have a moderately increased risk of breast cancer after extended periods of working rotating night shifts.",Excluded

Recent studies expand the expression of disease involving the choroid, retina, optic nerve and heart. Method(s): Clinical Case: Female, 63-year-old, with hypertension and dyslipidemia, both medicated, otherwise healthy. She had four close family members with history of vascular events, including stroke or myocardial infarction, before the age of 50. She noticed vision problems in her left eye of acute onset. Her visual acuities were 10/10 OD and 1/10 OS with a left relative afferent pupillary defect. Bilateral funduscopic examination showed: narrowing and arteriolar sheathing, arteriovenous nipping, discrete perifoveal pigment changes, left optic disc atrophy. Without other neurological abnormalities. Humphrey perimetry: paracentral scotoma in OD; inferior cecocentral and upper arcuate scotomas in OS. Brain MRI: important periventricular and subcortical ischemic leukoencephalopathy, and multiple ischemic vascular lacunae. Additionally, several enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces were located mostly at external capsules and anterior temporo-polar regions. Result(s): The molecular study detected the mutation c.1672C>T(p.Arg558Cys) in heterozygosity in NOTCH3 gene.

Cerebral and retinal vessels share anatomical and physiological properties. The abnormalities of retina and optic nerve may be due to direct microvascular damage or due to trans-synaptic retrograde degeneration after injuries involving optic radiation.

Rat 9L gliosarcomas implanted in nude mice brains were irradiated by MRT 13 days after tumor inoculation using two orthogonal arrays of equally spaced 28 planar microbeams (25 microm width, 211 microm spacing and dose 500 Gy). At 1, 7 and 14 days after MRT, apparent diffusion coefficient, blood volume and vessel size index were mapped by MRI. Mean survival time after tumor inoculation increased significantly between MRT-treated and untreated groups (23 and 28 days respectively, log-rank test, p < 0.0001). A significant increase of apparent diffusion coefficient was observed 24 h after MRT in irradiated tumors versus non-irradiated ones. In the untreated group, both tumor size and vessel size index increased significantly (from 7.6 +/- 2.2 to 19.2 +/- 4.0 mm(2) and +23%, respectively) between the 14th and the 21st day after tumor cell inoculation. During the same period, in the MRT-treated group, no difference in tumor size was observed. The vessel size index measured in the MRT-treated group increased significantly (+26%) between 14 and 28 days of tumor growth. We did not observe the significant difference in blood volume between the MRT-treated and untreated groups. MRT slows 9L tumor growth in a mouse brain but MRI results suggest that the increase in survival time after our MRT approach may be rather due to a cytoreduction than to early direct effects of ionizing radiation on tumor vessels. These results suggest that MRT parameters need to be optimized to further damage tumor vessels.",Excluded

Seeds were counted on radiographs from CT simulation, first treatment and last treatment. Retention and use of at least three markers for kV/kV matching was considered a successful implant. A visual analogue scale (VAS) pain assessment was performed. SAS was used for data analysis.RESULTS: Fiducial marker placement was successful for kV/kV matching in 556/581 patients (95.7%). The procedure was aborted due to pain in two patients. Additional sedation during the procedure was required in two patients. Complications include urinary infections (2 patients, <0.5%) and transient haematuria (2 patients, <0.5%). There were no recorded calls requesting additional pain medication or delays in radiation due to complications. The number of seeds identified at simulation: 4 (2 patients), 3 (554 patients), 2 (21 patients), 1 (1 patient), 0 (1 patient). One patient with three seeds and two patients with <2 seeds had cone beam CT instead of kV/kV imaging for image guidance. No seeds were lost after simulation. The mean visual analogue pain score associated with transperineal gold seed insertion met patients' expectations (respectively 4.1 vs. 4.4 P = 0.19).CONCLUSION: Outpatient transperineal insertion of fiducials avoids the rectum, is effective, convenient, well tolerated and has few side effects.",Excluded
4520,"Transient dephosphorylation of p53 serine 376 as an early response to ionizing radiation In a previous paper we reported that the cytoplasmic sequestered p53 in cells of the SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell line could be induced to translocate to the nucleus by exposure to ionizing radiation. We have extended these studies to determine the fate of p53 in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells where constitutive p53 protein resides in the nucleus. A continuous increase in the nuclear p53 protein was observed in irradiated cells beginning 1 h after irradiation that persisted for 8 h. Surprisingly, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a transient, rapid and sensitive increase in a radiation-induced nuclear dephosphorylated p53 using antibody PAb421, which detects p53 when serine 376 is dephosphorylated. The PAb421 epitope was detectable after exposure to radiation doses as low as 0.5 cGy and was 10 to 20 times more sensitive compared to detection of p53 protein levels. The results are consistent with a radiation-induced, sensitive and rapid dephosphorylation of p53 at serine 376. The rapid increase in the nuclear PAb421 epitope was blocked by the protein serine phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A but was not blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, suggesting that serine 376 was dephosphorylated by protein serine phosphatase 1 or 2A acting on pre-existing p53 protein. The data suggest that dephosphorylation of serine 376 on constitutive nuclear p53 is a sensitive and early signaling event in the response of cells to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation.",Excluded

3920,"Connecting radiotherapy with targeted anti-glioma therapy using superparamagnetic nanoparticles conjugated with granzyme B INTRODUCTION: 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) is overexpressed on the membrane of the glioblastoma cells, but not on corresponding normal cells. Membrane-bound Hsp70 (i.e., mHsp70) is rapidly internalized into tumor cells and thus targeting the protein might provide a promising strategy for theranostics. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are contrast negative agents that are used for the detection of tumors with MRI. In the presented study we conjugated the protease Granzyme B which is known to recognize mHsp70 to superparamagnetic iron nanoparticles to assess tumor-specific theranostic targeting before and after radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Synthesized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles covered with Granzyme B protease (GrB-SPIONs) were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering, NMR relaxometry. Cellular interactions of the GrB-SPIONs conjugates with tumor cell lines (i.e., U87, LN229, C6, K562, HeLa) were assessed using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and TEM. Brain tumor targeting was analyzed in the orthotopic C6 glioma model in rats, human U87 and LN229 gliomas in nu/nu mice. Following intravenous administration retention of the nanoparticles in the tumor site was assessed using high-field 11.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with subsequent histological assay. Biodistribution studies of the SPIONs were performed by NLR-M2 measurements. Combination of the nanoparticle targeting with radiotherapy of the brain tumors was performed at small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) (Xstrahl Inc., UK) using single of fractionated irradiation. RESULT(S): In vitro experiments demonstrated the selectivity of GrB-SPIONs conjugates to free and mHsp70 in different tumor cell types in a dose-dependent manner. High-resolution MRI on T2-weighted images showed the retention of the conjugates in C6 glioma model in rats, and U87 and LN229 human orthotopic glioma models in nu/nu mice. Accumulation of GrB-SPION nanoparticles in the glioma resulted in many-fold drop of T2-values in comparison to non-conjugated SPIONs. Biodistribution analysis using NLR-M2 measurements showed an increase in the tumor-to-background (normal brain) uptake ratio of GrB-SPIONs conjugates in glioma-bearing animals in comparison to SPIONs. Accumulation within Hsp70-positive glioma was enhanced after a single dose (10 Gy) of ionizing radiation. Combination of the radiotherapy and application of the GrB-SPIONs significantly increased the survival of the glioma-bearing animals. CONCLUSION(S): Elevated accumulation of the functionalized magnetic nanoparticles in the tumor due to radiosensitization proves the combination of radiotherapy and application of Hsp70-targeted agents such as Granzyme B in the theranostics of brain tumors.",Excluded

Reduction of cortical temperature to 31 degrees C increased the threshold irradiation time to 82 sec on the average. Ten- to thirty-sec heating of cerebral cortex with a thermode elicited CSD when surface temperature exceeded 47 degrees C. Histological examination of the cortical areas exposed to threshold irradiation revealed a central coagulation lesion surrounded by edema.

The rats were repeatedly (3 days, 30 min day(-1)) exposed to low-intensity (approximately = 0.3 mW cm(-2)) microwaves (915 MHz, 20-ms pulse duration), amplitude modulated (square-wave) at extremely low frequency (4 Hz).RESULTS: The exposure to extremely low frequency microwaves alone significantly enhanced the fast electroencephalographic rhythms (18-30 Hz). This effect was observed neither in subsequent sham-exposure experiment nor in radiation-naive animals. In the microwave-exposed rats, scopolamine (0.1 mg kg(-1), subcutaneously) did not cause a slowing in the electroencephalogram that was shown in non-exposed rats. A similarity between the scopolamine-induced electroencephalogram effect in the microwave-exposed rats and that of physostigmine (enhancing the acetylcholine level in the brain) in radiation-naive animals was noted. This paradoxical phenomenon stimulates new experimentation for understanding its mechanism(s).CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained provide additional evidence that repeated low-level exposure to extremely low frequency microwaves can modify an activity of cholinergic system in the brain.",Excluded
4721,"Nuclear Import Receptor Inhibits Phase Separation of FUS through Binding to Multiple Sites Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is believed to underlie formation of biomolecular condensates, cellular compartments that concentrate macromolecules without surrounding membranes. Physical mechanisms that control condensate formation/dissolution are poorly understood. The RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) undergoes LLPS in vitro and associates with condensates in cells. We show that the importin karyopherin-beta2/transportin-1 inhibits LLPS of FUS. This activity depends on tight binding of karyopherin-beta2 to the C-terminal proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) of FUS. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses reveal weak interactions of karyopherin-beta2 with sequence elements and structural domains distributed throughout the entirety of FUS. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that most of these same regions also contribute to LLPS of FUS. The data lead to a model where high-affinity binding of karyopherin-beta2 to the FUS PY-NLS tethers the proteins together, allowing multiple, distributed weak intermolecular contacts to disrupt FUS self-association, blocking LLPS.

3847,"Pre-operative meningioma embolization with ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer Introduction The benefit of pre-operative embolization of meningioma and hemangiopericytoma continues to be debated. Several large cohort studies of 80-198 patients have reported complication rates of 2.5% to 9% using particles or n-butyl cyanoacrylate (nBCA).[1-5] However, although a recent national registry of 898 patients found an association between liquid embolysate and complication rates, with an odds ratio of 3.9.[6] Endovascular technology continues to evolve and ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH or Onyx Medtronic) has been available for embolization of arteriovenous malformations for over a decade. The off-label use of EVOH for pre-operative embolization of meningiomas or hemangiopericytomas has only been reported in small series. This study reviewed the safety profile and embolization duration of our experience with EVOH embolization. Methods Review of institutional records identified 72 consecutive cases of meningiomas and hemangiopericytomas that underwent pre-operative embolization with EVOH prior to surgical resection from 2007 to 2017. The imaging and medical records were reviewed to identify tumor dimensions, vascular pedicles, endovascular equipment, outcomes and complications. Embolization rate was compared with Wilcox signed-rank test and complication rates were compared using the Fisher exact test. Results The tumors measured 5 cm (IQR 4.4-6.3) or 45 cm<sup>3</sup> (23-71) and were located on the convexity (26%), tentorium (22%), falx (20%), sphenoid ridge (15%), petrous (5%), anterior cranial fossa (5%), infratemporal fossa (4%), and middle cranial fossa (3%). The most frequent pedicle embolized was a middle meningeal artery. In 83% of cases, this was the first pedicle embolized and in 24% of cases, an additional MMA catheterization was used for embolization. Additional pedicles included the internal maxillary (8), occipital artery (7), superficial temporal (4), posterior meningeal (2), posterior auricular (1), and ascending pharyngeal (1) arteries. Tumor supply from branches of the internal carotid artery were typically not embolized: anterior cerebral branches (3 embolized: 7 not embolized), middle cerebral branches (0:11), ophthalmic branches (0:11). In 7 cases, nBCA was also used, most commonly in the superior cerebellar artery (3:7). Abstract O-033 Table 1 Tumor embolization characteristics VIEW INLINE VIEW POPUP There were symptomatic complications from embolization in 8% of cases. Twice, tumor necrosis and edema required earlier craniotomy and tumor evacuation, and four patients had new neurologic deficit from infarct. Two occurred from reflux and two occurred from embolysate migration across the tumor to pial vessels. The complication rate was not different from studies in meningiomas with 75 or more cases using other embolysates (p-value 0.15-1.0). In power analysis, comparison against previously published studies would distinguish a complication rate of 23% in a series of this size. Conclusion Embolization with EVOH is comparable in safety to other embolization techniques in meningioma or hemangiopericytoma. Similar to what has been described in arteriovenous malformations, simultaneous dual catheter embolization may decrease procedural time and radiation exposure.",Excluded
3688,"Acute impairment of saccadic eye movement is associated with cerebral infarction after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage Introduction Cerebral infarction due to delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Damage to the brain in the first 72 hours (""early brain injury"") is likely to play a key pathophysiological role but remains difficult to quantify objectively and noninvasively at the bedside-especially in those patients who do not require sedation or ventilation. Current diagnostic modalities used in routine clinical practice are either invasive, require ionising radiation or contrast or have a high learning curve and user variability. Objectives We sought to determine whether saccadic eye movements are impaired following SAH and whether measurement of saccadic latency (SL) in the acute period post-aneurysm rupture is associated with the likelihood of developing DCI in patients after SAH. Methods 24 male/female patients (mean age 53.32, range 31-70) with World Federation of Neurosurgeons (WFNS) grade I and II aneurysmal SAH, treated endovascularly within 72 hours of rupture were recruited. DCI and DCI-related cerebral infarction were defined as per consensus guidelines.1 Saccadometry data was collected at three time points: In the first 72 hours, between days 5 and 10 and at three months post-SAH. Data from 10 healthy age/gender matched controls was collected on one occasion for comparison. Results Age-adjusted median SL in patients was significantly prolonged in the first 72 hours post-SAH when compared to controls (188.7, 95 % CI = (176.9, 202.2)ms v 160.7, 95 % CI = (145.6, 179.4)ms, p = 0.0054 f-test). By 3 months post-SAH, there was no significant difference in median SL compared to controls (188.7, 95 % CI = (176.9, 202.2)ms v 180.0, 95 % CI = (165.1, 197.8)ms, p = 0.4175 f-test). Patients diagnosed with cerebral infarction due to DCI had a significantly higher age-adjusted median SL in the first 72 hours than those without infarction (240.6, 95 % CI = (216.7, 270.3)ms v 204.1, 95 % CI = (190.7, 219.5)ms, p = 0.0157 t-test). This difference was more pronounced during days 5-10 post-SAH-the peak incidence for DCI (303.7, 95 % CI = (266.7 352.7)ms v 207.6, 95 % CI = (193.7, 223.6)ms, p < 0.0001 t-test). A binary generalised linear model showed that median SL in the first 72 hours was the only significant predictor of cerebral infarction after SAH. Conclusions This is the first study to use saccadometry to measure eye movements in patients with SAH during the acute period post-rupture. Results show that median saccadic latency in the first 72 hours following SAH is an independent predictor of the risk of developing cerebral infarction due to DCI. Saccadometry may act as a potential objective biomarker of early brain injury to guide the need for intensive care admission and treatment. [Table Presented].",Excluded

Annual effective doses for flight crew have been estimated to be in the order of 2-5 mSv and can attain 75 mSv at career end. Epidemiological studies in this occupational group have been conducted over the last 15-20 years, usually with a focus on radiation-associated cancer. These studies are summarised in this note. Overall cancer risk was not elevated in most studies and subpopulations analysed, while malignant melanoma, other skin cancers and breast cancer in female aircrew have shown elevated incidence, with lesser risk elevations in terms of mortality. In some studies, including the large German cohort, brain cancer risk appears elevated. Cardiovascular mortality risks were generally very low. Dose information for pilots was usually derived from calculation procedures based on routine licence information, types of aircraft and routes/hours flown, but not on direct measurements. However, dose estimates have shown high validity when compared with measured values. No clear-cut dose-response patterns pointing to a higher risk for those with higher cumulative doses were found.

4748,"Flat panel CT following stapes prosthesis insertion: an experimental and clinical study OBJECTIVES: Anatomical information of the middle and inner ear is becoming increasingly important in post-operative evaluation especially after stapesplasty with unsuccessful improvement of the air-bone gap (ABG). So far computed tomography (CT) has been the first choice for detection of reasons for recurrent hearing loss. CT has the disadvantage of metal-induced artefacts after insertion of middle ear implants and of a relatively high irradiation dose.METHODS: Flat panel CT (fpCT) was performed in three temporal bone specimen after experimental insertion of different stapes prostheses, aiming to validate the accuracy of fpCT of the middle and inner ear. Additionally, 28 consecutive patients, supplied with different stapes prostheses underwent post-operative fpCT to compare the pre- and post-operative hearing results with the determined prosthesis position in the middle and inner ear.RESULTS: In all cases, fpCT showed a statistically significant correlation between hearing improvement and prosthesis position. This technique provided detailed post-operative information of the implant position in patients and temporal bone specimen.CONCLUSIONS: The new imaging technique of fpCT allows the immediate and almost artefact-free evaluation of surgical results following stapesplasty. Further benefits are a lower irradiation dose and higher isovolumetric resolution compared with standard CT.KEY POINTS: Flat panel computed tomography (fpCT) helps otosurgeons design precise stapes protheses. fpCT allows a prediction of the postoperative hearing outcome in patients. fpCT is an adequate imaging technique for immediate postoperative quality control. Postoperative management of patients with prosthesis-related complications is more appropriate.",Excluded
3895,"Discrimination and quantification of live/dead rat brain cells using a non-linear segmentation model The automatic cell analysis method is capable of segmenting the cells and can detect the number of live/dead cells present in the body. This study proposed a novel non-linear segmentation model (NSM) for the segmentation and quantification of live/dead cells present in the body. This work also reveals the aspects of electromagnetic radiation on the cell body. The bright images of the hippocampal CA3 region of the rat brain under the resolution of 60 x objective are used to analyze the effects called NISSL-stained dataset. The proposed non-linear segmentation model segments the foreground cells from the cell images based on the linear regression analysis. These foreground cells further get discriminated as live/dead cells and quantified using shape descriptors and geometric method, respectively. The proposed segmentation model is showing promising results (accuracy, 82.82%) in comparison with the existing renowned approaches. The counting analysis of live and dead cells using the proposed method is far better than the manual counts. Therefore, the proposed segmentation model and quantifying procedure is an amalgamated method for cell quantification that yields better segmentation results and provides pithy insights into the analysis of neuronal anomalies at a microscopic level.

4465,"Repeat intracoronary radiation for recurrent in-stent restenosis in patients who failed intracoronary radiation BACKGROUND: Intracoronary radiation therapy (IRT) is the only proven treatment for in-stent restenosis (ISR). It is, however, associated with a significant failure rate. The present study evaluated the outcomes of patients who underwent repeat intracoronary radiation for recurrent ISR.METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-one consecutive patients who failed a previous radiation treatment, presented with angina and angiographic evidence of ISR, and were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and repeat radiation to the same segment were studied. Twenty-five patients were treated with gamma radiation in a dose of 15 Gy, and 26 were treated with beta radiation doses of 18.3 to 23 Gy. The mean cumulative dose for this cohort was 39.5+/-11.9 Gy (range, 29 to 75.6 Gy). The outcomes of those patients were compared with outcomes of 299 patients who also failed initial radiation but were treated with repeat conventional PCI to a previously irradiated segment without repeat radiation. At 9 months after treatment, the repeat-IRT group had lower rates of target lesion revascularization (23.5% versus 54.6%; P<0.001) and major adverse cardiac events, including target vessel revascularization (29.4% versus 61.3%; P<0.001). At 9 months, patients with repeat IRT were free of angiographic and clinical events related to the radiation therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Repeat gamma or beta radiation to treat failed IRT for ISR after conventional PCI is safe and effective at 9 months and should be considered as a therapeutic option for this difficult patient subset.",Excluded
4799,"Postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery for resected brain metastases: A comparison of outcomes for large resection cavities PURPOSE: Although historical trials have established the role of surgical resection followed by whole brain irradiation (WBRT) for brain metastases, WBRT has recently been shown to cause significant neurocognitive decline. Many practitioners have employed postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to tumor resection cavities to increase local control without causing significant neurocognitive sequelae. However, studies analyzing outcomes of large brain metastases treated with resection and postoperative SRS are lacking. Here we compare outcomes in patients with large brain metastases >4 cm to those with smaller metastases <=4 cm treated with surgical resection followed by SRS to the resection cavity.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Consecutive patients with brain metastases treated at our institution with surgical resection and postoperative SRS were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified into <=4 cm and >4 cm cohorts based on preoperative maximal tumor dimension. Cumulative incidence of local failure, radiation necrosis, and death were analyzed for the 2 cohorts using a competing-risk model, defined as the time from SRS treatment date to the measured event, death, or last follow-up.RESULTS: A total of 117 consecutive cases were identified. Of these patients, 90 (77%) had preoperative tumors <=4 cm, and 27 (23%) >4 cm in greatest dimension. The only significant baseline difference between the 2 groups was a higher proportion of patients who underwent gross total resection in the <=4 cm compared with the >4 cm cohort, 76% versus 48%, respectively (P <.01). The 1-year rates of local failure, radiation necrosis, and overall survival for the <=4 cm and >4 cm cohorts were 12.3% and 16.0%, 26.9% and 28.4%, and 80.6% and 67.6%, respectively (all P >.05). The rates of local failure and radiation necrosis were not statistically different on multivariable analysis based on tumor size.CONCLUSIONS: Brain metastases >4 cm in largest dimension managed by resection and radiosurgery to the tumor cavity have promising local control rates without a significant increase in radiation necrosis on our retrospective review.",Excluded
4488,"Chronic morphine exposure impairs short-term synaptic depression of geniculo-cortical visual pathway in vivo Chronic morphine exposure can induce addiction and affect synaptic plasticity, but the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unknown. Two forms of short-term synaptic depression (paired-pulse depression (PPD) and frequency depression) were investigated in vivo in the geniculo-cortical visual pathway of morphine-treated and saline-treated (as control) adult rats. Acute exposure to morphine had no effect on paired-pulse synaptic depression and 10-40 Hz induced frequency synaptic depression. However, chronic morphine exposure reduced markedly the paired-pulse depression and frequency depression at 40 Hz. The effect of chronic morphine exposure on short-term synaptic plasticity in the geniculo-cortical visual pathway was sensitization given that morphine re-exposure further significantly reduced the short-term synaptic depression. Interestingly, the further reduction in short-term synaptic depression due to re-exposure of morphine was recovered to normal (control) levels at 3 to 6h after morphine re-exposure. These findings suggest that chronic morphine treatment could significantly degrade the short-term synaptic plasticity of geniculo-cortical visual pathway.",Excluded
4837,"The mitochondria/caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway plays a role in the positive effects of a power frequency electromagnetic field on Alzheimer's disease neuronal model In this study, rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were induced into an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) neuronal model using nerve growth factor (NGF; 50 ng/mL) and Amyloid beta<sub>25-35</sub> (20 mumol/L). Changes in the morphological structure, cell viability, apoptosis rate, and expression of apoptosis-related protein induced by exposure to a power frequency electromagnetic field (PF-MF; 50 Hz, 100 muT, 24 h) were detected respectively by light and electron microscopy, the MTT assay, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The results showed that 3-12 h after PF-MF exposure, the pathological injury was improved partly; metabolic activity was promoted and cell apoptosis was inhibited in the AD neuronal model. In addition, PF-MF exposure significantly inhibited the expression of Caspase8, Caspase3, and CytC, but increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio of the AD neuronal model. Meanwhile, PF-MF seemed to have no effect on the expression of Fas and TNFR1. This study indicated that the mitochondria/caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway plays an important role in the positive effects of PF-MF on an AD neuronal model. The results suggested that PF-MF exposure might have potential therapeutic value for AD, and the underling molecular mechanisms still need further studies.",Excluded
3644,"Rapid activation of presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by nerve-released transmitter Nicotine's ability to enhance neurotransmitter release has implicated presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in synaptic modulation, but there aze few examples where presynaptic nAChRs are known to be activated by nerve-released transmitter. We searched for endogenous activation of presynaptic nAChRs in the calyceal nerve terminals of the chick ciliary ganglion by imaging presynaptic calcium transients using dextran-coupled indicator dyes. The amplitude of Ca(+)signals recorded in individual nerve terminals was frequency dependent over 2-50 Hz. Calcium transients evoked by stimulation of the preganglionic nerve were significantly reduced (approximately 10-15%) by the nonspecific nAChR antagonist d-tubocurarine (d-TC; 100 microM) and the alpha7-specific antagonist methyllycaconitine (20-50 nM) but were not affected by 10 microM dihydro-beta-erythroidine, which should inhibit several non-alpha7 nAChRs. Feedback was rapid and did not require a stimulation-dependent build-up of transmitter, as d-TC and MLA reduced the amplitude of the first calcium transient in a 2-Hz train. Choline is an agonist at alpha7 nAChRs but is not the sole agonist in this system, as inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by echothiophate failed to reduce calcium transients. These results show that nerve-released acetylcholine (ACh) feeds back onto presynaptic alpha7 nAChRs to enhance calcium signals within the terminal. This feedback may help maintain the high rate of transmission at this cholinergic synapse.",Excluded

The limited literature consists of case reports and small case series, with the largest including 25 patients. We performed a population-based study to describe disease course, treatment, and survival in women with NECE compared to endometrioid endometrial cancer (EC). Method(s): The National Cancer Data Base was used to identify women with NECE and women with poorly differentiated EC from 2004 to 2015. The cohort was limited to women with histologic confirmation and who received hysterectomy without neoadjuvant therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were developed to compare survival between groups using a log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard regression models were fit to analyze associations between survival and histology while adjusting for clinical and demographic differences. Result(s): A total of 28,291 women with EC and 364 women with NECE were identified. More women with neuroendocrine tumors were non-white and presented with later stage disease (P < 0.05 for both). Stage III-IV tumors were diagnosed in 56% of women with NECE versus 26% of women with EC (P < 0.001). Women with NECE were more likely to receive chemotherapy (60% vs 30%, P < 0.001), but were less likely to receive radiation (28% vs 48%, P < 0.001). In a multivariable model, women with NECE were more than twice as likely to die than those with EC tumors (HR = 2.29, 95% CI 1.85-2.84). Similar trends were noted in analyses limited to stage I (HR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.02-2.57) and stage III (HR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.91-3.61) neoplasms. In a Kaplan-Meier analysis, median survival was 17 months (95% CI 12-23) for women with NECE and 144 months (95% CI 140-148) for those with EC (P < 0.001). Five-year survival was 38% (95% CI 32.7-43.8%) in those with NECE vs 69% (95% CI 68.2-69.4%) in those with EC (P < 0.001). See Figure 1.

4099,"Ventilation induced apnea and its effect on dorsal brainstem inspiratory neurones in the rat The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of mechanical ventilation (MV) on inherent breathing and on dorsal brainstem nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) respiratory cell function. In pentobarbitone-anaesthetised rats, application of MV at combined high frequencies and volumes (representing threshold levels) produced apnea. The apnea persisted as long as MV was maintained at or above the threshold frequency and volume. Following removal of MV, inherent breathing did not resume immediately, with the diaphragm exhibiting post-mechanical ventilation apnea. The fall in arterial P(CO2) (Pa(CO2)) levels evoked by MV-engendered hyperventilation was shown not to be the trigger for initiation of apnea. MV-induced apnea was immediately reversed by bilateral vagotomy. Further, MV-induced apnea could not be evoked in bilaterally vagotomized animals suggesting that vagal feedback is the critical pathway for its initiation. NTS inspiratory neurones were inhibited during both MV-induced apnea and post-mechanical ventilation apnea, implying the involvement of central neural mechanisms in mediating this effect.",Excluded

For a 740-MBq (20 mCi) injected dose of 99mTc-HMPAO, the radiation exposure to the lacrimal glands is 10.2 mGy (1.02 rad), or 0.0138 mGy/MBq (0.051 rad/mCi). These values are five times lower than the ones reported by the manufacturer of HMPAO. As the dosimetry calculation is only for subjects showing 99mTc-HMPAO uptake in the lacrimal gland, the average radiation dose to all subjects is considerably lower, 1/10 of the estimated value.",Excluded

Report of a case Treatment of patients with osteoradionecrosis of the mandible with a pathologic fracture consists in almost all cases of a continuity resection of the mandible.

In this case report we present a 38-year-old woman who developed osteoradionecrosis of the mandible with a pathologic fracture 1 1/2 years after combined surgical and radiation therapy of an adenocarcinoma of the right parotid gland. The patient had a subcondylar pathologic fracture together with osteolysis in the right mandibular body, normally an indication for partial resection of the mandible. Because of the absence of denuded bone, fistulation, and the poor quality of the surrounding soft tissues, a more conservative approach was chosen. Treatment consisted of hyperbaric oxygen and dental extractions with alveolectomy with the patient under local anesthesia. During follow-up, a second pathologic fracture occurred in the region of the right first and second molar. No additional treatment was given.

3790,"Adrenergic control of rat pineal NO synthase We have previously shown that exposure of rats to constant light (LL) induced a decrease in NO synthase (NOS) activity in the pineal gland. We present here the evidence that chronic (5 days) norepinephrine (NE) or isoproterenol treatment prevents the effect of LL and enhances pineal NOS activity in LL animals. This effect of NE appears to be mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, because it was not mimicked by the alpha-agonist phenylephrine. Pineal NOS activity was reduced in 16-h light/8-h dark animals treated for 4 days with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol but not with the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin, indicating again an involvement of beta-adrenergic receptor in the control of NOS. Treatment with adrenergic antagonists did not affect cortical NOS activity, suggesting that the control of NOS is different in these two tissues or that the pineal expresses a specific isoform of the enzyme. Taken together, these data suggest that NE controls NOS in the pineal gland through beta-adrenergic receptors. To our knowledge, this represent the first demonstration of a regulation of NOS by a neurotransmitter in the CNS, as assayed under Vmax conditions.",Excluded

PCNS-PTLD occurs in 7%-15% of all PTLD cases. We present a case of isolated PCNS lymphoma two years after renal transplant. Case Description: A 57 year old woman with PMH of ESRD s/p kidney transplant (D/EBV -,R/ EBV +) with chronic CrCl of 30-40% presented with paresthesia and numbness over the right side of her body with mild ataxia 2 years post transplant. Physical exam revealed only numbness over the right side of body. MRI with contrast revealed a left thalamic lesion with moderate vasogenic edema, and MR spectroscopy confirmed high grade neoplasm involving left thalamus. Stereotactic biopsy showed polymorphic CD-20 and EBV positive PTLD. EBV PCR were elevated. Further evaluation ruled out systemic PTLD. Myfortic was stopped and oral steroids started with mild improvement in symptoms. Choice of systemic chemotherapy was limited due to reduced CrCl and risks of graft failure. She received modified regimen with renally adjusted high dose Methotrexate, Vincristine and Rituximab for 6 cycles with partial remission and then Temozolomide for 7 cycles with complete remission. Discussion(s): The incidence of PTLD ranges from 1 to 25% with 90% of cases being EBV-associated, CD20 positive, B cell neoplasms. PCNS-PTLD has a higher incidence in renal SOT, occurs late and is usually monomorphic unlike our patient. Median time of occurrence is 4-5 years after transplant. Risk factors include age, intensity of immunosuppression, time to transplant and EBV status of donor and recipient. Common presenting features include neurological deficits, seizure, and raised intracranial pressure. MRI is the preferred imaging and shows multifocal, ill defined, ring enhancing lesions usually in supratentorial and lobar regions. Positive CSF EBV PCR is highly suggestive but biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Treatment modalities include reduction of immunosuppression, rituximab, high dose methotrexate, cytarabine and cranial radiotherapy. Use of high dose methotrexate has shown improved outcomes with median survival of 26-47 months. Lack of response to first line therapy is considered the dominant prognostic factor.

Clinical data with RON admitted to Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from June 1999 to October 2010 were investigated retrospectively.RESULTS: Thirty-five cases (61 eyes) with RON were analyzed. All cases manifested as sudden binocular or monocular painless vision decrease. In 18 cases (51.4%), symptoms occurred within 36 months after the completion of radiation. In 43 eyes (70.5%), the visual acuity was less than 0.05 and/or with a visual field less than 10 degrees. In 52 eyes which the fundus could be examined, 41 eyes (78.8%) showed a clear boundary of optic papilla, including 6 eyes (14.6%) with normal appearance of optic papilla, 30 eyes (73.2%) with lighter color, 5 eyes (12.2%) with pale optic papilla, and 11 eyes (21.2%) with edematous or hemorrhagic and/or exudative optic papilla. Only 14 eyes showed abnormal visual field examination, mainly manifested as nerve bundle defect scotoma. Seven eyes (50%) manifested as arcuate scotoma, 3 eyes (21.4%) manifested as central scotoma and/or paracentral scotoma, 2 eyes accompanied by blind spot enlargement, 1 eye showed paracentral scotoma and 1 eye with quadrantanopia. Twenty-three eyes received fluorescein angiography (FFA), the major manifestations were low fluorescence at the optic nerve and areas of capillary nonperfusion.

One process which might contribute to rapid termination of the responses to Ins 1,4,5-P3 and to light is the hydrolysis of Ins 1,4,5-P3 by an InsP3-5-phosphatase to form inositol 1,4-bisphosphate. Inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins 2,4,5-P3) is known to be less hydrolysable by the InsP3-5-phosphatase than is Ins 1,4,5-P3. Whereas ventral photoreceptors respond to an injection of Ins 1,4,5-P3 with a single wave of depolarization, the response to Ins 2,4,5-P3 is a burst of waves of depolarization. Our hypothesis is that it is the resistance to hydrolysis by the InsP3-5-phosphatase which accounts for the burst of waves produced by Ins 2,4,5-P3. To test this idea we injected ventral photoreceptors with Ins 1,4,5-P3 in the presence of the non-specific phosphatase inhibitors, vanadate and fluoride, which prolong the response to a flash of light in ventral photoreceptors (D.W. Corson, A. Fein, W.W. Walthall, J. Gen. Physiol. 82 (1983) 659-677). In the presence of fluoride or vanadate the response to Ins 1,4,5-P3 was composed of a burst of waves rather than a single wave of depolarization. We conclude that hydrolysis of Ins 1,4,5-P3 by the InsP3-5-phosphatase plays a role in terminating the ventral photoreceptors response to Ins 1,4,5-P3 and also to light.",Excluded

3722,"Goniometric measurement for the estimation of anisotropy coefficient of human and animal pancreas Estimation of optical properties of biologic tissues is determinant for laser dosimetry in medical applications. Tissues highly absorb and scatter the light in near infrared spectrum, where the laser provides therapeutic effects. Novel frontiers of clinical practice, e.g., the employment of laser light for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, require information about pancreas-laser interaction, which are crucial for therapy management. The property of biological tissues to scatter the light traveling through is described by the anisotropy coefficient (g). The relationship between g and the angular distribution of the scattered light is described by Henyey-Greenstein phase function. The measurement of angular distribution of scattered light is performed by the goniometric technique. This paper describes the estimation of g of ex vivo pancreas at 1064 nm, performed by a goniometric-based system, where a photodetector measures intensities of scattered light at fixed angles between -120degree and 120degree. A two-term Henyey-Greenstein phase function has been employed to estimate anisotropy coefficient for forward (gfs) and backward scattering (gbs). Experimental trails were performed to assess the repeatability of measurement system: percentage value of standard deviation is generally lower than 8% for angles higher (lower) than 13degree (13degree). Measurements were performed for the first time on healthy swine pancreas, aiming to investigate the influence of coagulation temperature: gfs decreases from 0.94 (at 25 degreeC) to 0.93 (at 80 degreeC). Afterwards, the same set up has been employed for the estimation of g of human pancreas affected by neuroendocrine tumor, which presented an estimated values for gfs of 0.89.",Excluded

An alternative strategy would be to utilise these viruses to deliver therapeutic transgenes and enhance their tumour cell killing capacity. The herpes simplex virus-1 deletion mutant HSV1716 is a conditionally- replicating oncolytic virus. The safety of HSV1716 has been demonstrated in phase 1 clinical trails with no toxicity attributable to the virus in any patients and provided proof of principle that the virus is capable of directly destroying human tumour cells while leaving normal cells intact (1). To enhance its therapeutic potential, we have engineered HSV1716 to convey the noradrenaline transporter gene (NAT) and thus rendered transfected cells targetable with the radiopharmaceutical [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG.

Intermittent (1 min ""On,"" 1 min ""Off"") field exposure (10-min duration) was used. Hemispheric asymmetry in frequency spectra (averaged data for 10 or 1 min) of an ongoing EEG was characterized by a power decrease in the 1.5-3 Hz range on the left hemisphere and by a power decrease in the 10-14 and 20-30 Hz ranges on the right hemisphere. No differences between control and exposure experiments were shown under these routines of data averaging. Significant elevations of EEG asymmetry in 10-14 Hz range were observed during the first 20 s after four from five onsets of the MW field, when averaged spectra were obtained for every 10 s. Under neither control nor pre- and postexposure conditions was this effect observed. These results are discussed with respect to interaction of MW fields with the EEG generators.",Excluded
3938,"Clinical acceptability of SRS treatment of two simultaneous targets with varying magnitudes of rotation error Purpose/Objective(s): We investigated the target rotational errors (i.e., pitch, roll, yaw) and evaluated the dosimetric impact of simultaneous treatment ofmultiple brain lesionswith amono-isocentric technique of using image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery. The Elekta Synergy S with dissociated simultaneous multiple port (dose islands) within a single field. This simultaneous-treatment technique enables us to more efficiently treat two lesions concurrently when each target conforms to the radiosurgery protocol. Materials/Methods:We created a clinical reference plan (CRP), which has optimized dose coverage, conformity, homogeneity, and step-wise fall-off to zero dose.We then applied orthogonal-to-spherical coordinate system transformations about the isocenter, to each individual beam's parameters that simulated the multiple rotational errors for this research. For each patient (n = 10) 24 experimental treatment plan (ETP) calculations were. For each ETP , DVHs were computed for the two PTVs, optic nerves, optic chiasm and brainstem. From all of the DVH data, critical analytical indices were computed and compared to the CRP. These analytical indices include: Coverage, conformity, Dose Homogeneity, and Dose Gradient. A neurosurgical team evaluated the plans and subjectively evaluated the clinical suitability of each plan. The accumulated indices were scored and weighted to obtain a single value, the Unified Dosimetry Index (UDI). The UDI represents a plan's suitability vis-a-vis the CRP. Result(s): From the computed UDIs we observed that ETPs with 1-2 degrees of rotation remain within the defined range of suitability for clinical treatment. Rotation errors greater than 2 degrees resulted in UDI outside the clinically acceptable range. Conclusion(s): Isocenter rotations of 3 degrees or more significantly reduces the quality of clinical SRS treatments. Small lesions are especially vulnerable to loss of dosimetric coverage. SRS treatment setup should have a combined rotational error less than 2.5 degrees to effectively deliver the prescribed radiation dose using multiple brain lesions with mono-isocentric technique.",Excluded
3879,"Nongynecologic Findings Seen at Pelvic US Ultrasonography (US) is frequently the first imaging modality used to examine women with symptoms involving the pelvis. It is widely available and involves no exposure to ionizing radiation. Images can be acquired with a transabdominal, endovaginal, or translabial approach, and the use of video clips and three-dimensional reconstructions can be helpful. US is excellent for assessment of the uterus, ovaries, and adnexa. Occasionally, nongynecologic pelvic diseases arising from the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal systems and the pelvic peritoneal and extraperitoneal spaces may be detected and can be a source of diagnostic dilemma. US can be helpful not only in the detection but also occasionally in the characterization of such entities. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are useful in complicated cases. In this article, the normal US appearance of the bowel and US signs of bowel disease and specific entities, including appendicitis, diverticular disease, bowel obstruction, appendiceal mucocele, and intestinal tumors, are reviewed. The lower urinary tract is included in the field of view in every pelvic US examination; commonly encountered entities related to the urinary bladder, distal ureter, and urethra are illustrated. In addition to arising in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, pathologic conditions in the pelvis can arise in the peritoneal or extraperitoneal space. Although conditions of the pelvic peritoneal and extraperitoneal spaces are rare, it is important to recognize these entities and distinguish them from the more common gynecologic diseases. Owing to the implications for diagnosis and management, radiologists and other physicians who perform pelvic US should be aware of the spectrum of nongynecologic pathologic entities that can be detected. <sup>Â©</sup>RSNA, 2017.",Excluded

4208,"Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma.METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival.RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD.CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume.",Excluded
4030,"Rapid enzymatic response to compensate UV radiation in copepods Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) causes physical damage to DNA, carboxylation of proteins and peroxidation of lipids in copepod crustaceans, ubiquitous and abundant secondary producers in most aquatic ecosystems. Copepod adaptations for long duration exposures include changes in behaviour, changes in pigmentation and ultimately changes in morphology. Adaptations to short-term exposures are little studied. Here we show that short-duration exposure to UVR causes the freshwater calanoid copepod, Eudiaptomus gracilis, to rapidly activate production of enzymes that prevent widespread collateral peroxidation (glutathione S-transferase, GST), that regulate apoptosis cell death (Caspase-3, Casp-3), and that facilitate neurotransmissions (cholinesterase-ChE). None of these enzyme systems is alone sufficient, but they act in concert to reduce the stress level of the organism. The interplay among enzymatic responses provides useful information on how organisms respond to environmental stressors acting on short time scales. Â© 2012 Souza et al.",Excluded
4758,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ameliorates recognition memory impairment induced by hindlimb unloading in mice associated with BDNF/TrkB signaling Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which could improve learning and memory, is widely used in psychiatry and neurology as a therapeutic approach. There are few studies reporting effective countermeasures to cognition decline in astronauts during space flight. Accordingly, we examined whether rTMS was able to significantly alleviate the learning and memory deficits induced by hindlimb unloading (HU), a general accepted rodent model to simulate microgravity, in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four groups: Sham, rTMS, HU, and HU+rTMS groups. The hindlimb unloading procedure continued for consecutive 14 days. Meanwhile, high frequency rTMS (15Hz) was applied for 14 days from the 1<sup>st</sup> day of HU procedure. The novel object recognition test showed that the recognition memory was evidently impaired in the HU group compared to that in the Sham group, however, rTMS significantly attenuated the impairment of the memory. Furthermore, rTMS significantly improved the HU-induced LTP impairment and increased spine density in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region. Additionally, rTMS enhanced the expressions of postsynaptic function-associated proteins N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NR2B and NR2A) and postsynaptic density protein (PSD95), upregulated BDNF/TrkB signaling and increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) in the HU+rTMS group. In conclusion, the data suggest that high frequency rTMS may be an effective countermeasure against the learning and memory deficiency, induced by simulated microgravity.",Excluded
4137,"Resolution of the more anteriorly positioned psoas muscle following correction of spinal sagittal alignment from spondylolisthesis: Case report Several studies have described the radiographic, histological, and morphological changes to the paraspinal muscle in patients with chronic low-back pain due to degenerative diseases of the spine. Gross anatomical illustrations have shown that the psoas muscle lies lateral to the L4-5 vertebrae and subsequently thins and dissociates from the vertebral body at L5-S1 in a ventrolateral course. A ""rising psoas"" may influence the location of the lumbar plexus and result in transient neurological injury on lateral approach to the spine. It is postulated that axial back pain may be exacerbated by anatomical changes of paraspinal musculature as a direct result of degenerative spine conditions. To their knowledge, the authors present the first reported case of a more anteriorly positioned psoas muscle and its resolution following correction of spondylolisthesis in a 62-year-old woman. This case highlights the dynamic nature of degenerative spinal disorders and illustrates that psoas muscle position can be affected by sagittal balance.

4379,"Magnetic resonance based small animal radiotherapy in neuro-oncology Compared to computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides vastly superior soft-tissue contrast. This makes it much easier to visualize lesion boundaries that will result in a much better delineation of the target volume, helping to better irradiate the lesion and avoid surrounding tissue.Therefore, combining MRI with CT data is increasingly used for radiotherapy planning in the clinic. This combined CT/MRI dataset contains both the information required for targeting and for dose calculations. During this presentation, three studies will be presented where MRI and small animal radiotherapy were combined in the field of neuro-oncology. In a first study, we used a combined CT/MRI dataset to guide the irradiation of brain tumours in a F98 glioblastoma rat model using a micro-irradiator. Contrast-enhanced MRI images were acquired to follow up tumour growth after orthotopic inoculation, to monitor treatment response, and to delineate the target volume during radiotherapy planning. Using multiple non-coplanar arcs the prescribed dose could be delivered to 90% of the target volume, while minimizing the dose to normal brain tissue. A challenging aspects of small animal CT imaging relates to the radiation dose received by the animals. This might become a very important issue when the therapeutic dose has to be delivered in multiple fractions spaced over time, where each individual irradiation requires a CT for accurate animal positioning. Therefore, in a second study we investigated the feasibility of a MRI-only based workflow for radiotherapy planning of the rat brain, that enables both accurate target delineation and accurate dose calculations using only MRI-based volumes. Multiple MRI sequences were used to generate synthetic CT images that could be used for dose calculations, because only one MRI volume was not sufficient to separate all major tissue types (air, soft tissue, bone) in the rat head. The synthetic CT images were sufficiently similar to the segmented CT images that are routinely used for radiotherapy planning on preclinical radiation research platforms. No significant differences were observed between CT and MRI based dose calculations when more complex beam configurations (multiple beams) were used in the dose plan. However, further research is required in the thoracic or abdominal region of small animals, where more tissue classes will be required to allow for accurate dose calculations compared to the rat head. Finally, discrimination between brain tumor recurrence (glioblastoma) and radiation necrosis (RN) remains a diagnostic challenge because both entities have similar imaging characteristics on conventional MRI. Functional imaging techniques, such as dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI or positron emission tomography (PET), could overcome this diagnostic dilemma. A third study will be presented to investigate the potential of DCE-MRI and PET in discriminating high-grade glioma from RN in rats. Induction of RN was achieved by irradiating the right frontal region with 60 Gy using multiple arcs. Results suggested that functional imaging can be used to discriminate glioblastoma (recurrence) from RN. Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded

3718,"Neurocognitive deficits after radiation therapy for brain malignancies Radiotherapy (RT) has proven to be an effective therapeutic tool in treatment of a wide variety of brain tumors; however, it has a negative impact on quality of life and neurocognitive function. Cognitive dysfunction associated with both the disease and adverse effects of RT is one of the most concerning complication among long-term survivors. The effects of RT to brain can be divided into acute, early delayed, and late delayed. It is, however, the late delayed effects of RT that lead to severe neurological consequences such as minor-to-severe cognitive deficits due to irreversible focal or diffuse necrosis of brain parenchyma. In this review, we discuss current and emerging data regarding the relationship between RT and neurocognitive outcomes, and therapeutic strategies to prevent/treat postradiation neurocognitive deficits.

3742,"The distinctive cellular responses to DNA strand breaks caused by a DNA topoisomerase I poison in conjunction with DNA replication and RNA transcription Camptothecin (CPT) inhibits DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) through a non-catalytic mechanism that stabilizes the Top1-DNA cleavage complex (Top1cc) and blocks the DNA re-ligation step, resulting in the accumulation in the genome of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs), which are converted to secondary strand breaks when they collide with the DNA replication and RNA transcription machinery. DNA strand breaks mediated by replication, which have one DNA end, are distinct in repair from the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that have two ends and are caused by ionizing radiation and other agents. In contrast to two-ended DSBs, such one-ended DSBs are preferentially repaired through the homologous recombination pathway. Conversely, the repair of one-ended DSBs by the non-homologous end-joining pathway is harmful for cells and leads to cell death. The choice of repair pathway has a crucial impact on cell fate and influences the efficacy of anticancer drugs such as CPT derivatives. In addition to replication-mediated one-ended DSBs, transcription also generates DNA strand breaks upon collision with the Top1cc. Some reports suggest that transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks correlate with neurodegenerative diseases. However, the details of the repair mechanisms of, and cellular responses to, transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks still remain unclear. In this review, combining our recent results and those of previous reports, we introduce and discuss the responses to CPT-induced DNA damage mediated by DNA replication and RNA transcription.

4409,"Stereotactic proton beam therapy of skull base meningiomas PURPOSE: To review outcomes for patients with skull base meningiomas treated using the stereotactic proton beam at the National Accelerator Center (NAC), Republic of South Africa.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since 1993, 27 patients with intracranial meningiomas have been treated stereotactically with protons at NAC. Of those, 23 were located on the skull base, were large or had complex shapes, and were treated with radical intent. Both stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT, 16 or more fractions) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT, 3 fractions) were used. Eighteen patients underwent proton HSRT, while 5 patients were treated with SRT. The mean target volume for the HSRT group was 15.6 cm(3) (range 2.6-63 cm(3)). The mean ICRU reference dose was 20.3 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGyE), and the mean minimum planning target dose was 16.3 CGyE. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up periods were 40 and 31 months respectively. The mean volume in the SRT group was 43.7 cm(3), with ICRU reference doses ranging from 54 CGyE in 27 fractions to 61.6 CGyE in 16 fractions.RESULTS: In the HSRT group, 16/18 (89%) of patients remained clinically stable or improved, while 2/18 (11%) deteriorated. Radiologic control was achieved in 88% of patients, while 2 patients had a marginal failure. Among the 5 SRT patients, 2 were clinically better, and 3 remained stable. All SRT patients achieved radiologic control. Three patients (13%), 2 of them in the HSRT group, suffered permanent neurologic deficits.

4564,"Saturation of DNA repair measured by alkaline elution To determine whether the half-times (T1/2) of the DNA repair processes measured by alkaline elution increased in a dose-dependent manner, exponentially growing 9L/Ro rat brain tumor cells were irradiated with doses of 15-50 Gy, and their DNA repair kinetics was measured by alkaline elution. At 15 Gy, the DNA repair kinetics was biphasic with the fast phase having a T1/2 approximately 6 min and the slow phase having a T1/2 approximately 42 min. As the dose was increased to 50 Gy, the fast-phase T1/2 remained at approximately 6 min, but the slow-phase T1/2 increased to approximately 87 min. Although a dose-dependent increase in the T1/2 of the slow phase of DNA repair (saturation) was measured by alkaline elution, both the absolute value of the slow-phase T1/2 and the dependency of the slow-phase T1/2 on dose were less than those measured by alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation in zonal rotors with slow reorienting gradient capability. Thus these two techniques appear either to depend on different hydrodynamic properties of the DNA or to have different coefficients of dependency for the same hydrodynamic properties of the DNA. The lower sensitivity for detection of the dose dependency of DNA repair makes it unlikely that the alkaline elution technique will be useful for quantitatively relating the shape of mammalian cell survival curves to the doses at which saturation of a DNA repair process occurs.",Excluded
4036,"Monocarboxylate transporter-4 depletion inhibits stemness, promotes DNA damage and radiosensitizes glioblastoma stem cells Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumor in adults, with a median survival for patients of 12-15 months after diagnosis. Standard therapy includes radiation and chemotherapy, with GBM recurrences refractory to second line treatments. Given the lack of therapeutic opportunities in GBM, new treatment strategies are urgently needed. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) have been shown to support GBM maintenance and exhibit enhanced resistance to ionizing radiation, a cornerstone of GBM therapy. Monocarboxylate transporter-4 (MCT4, SLC16A3) is highly expressed in the vast majority of GBMs and predominantly in cells that congregate in ""palisades"" around centers of necrosis or in cells where hypoxiainducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is expressed either due to reduced oxygen levels or other microenvironmental stresses. MCT4 appears to regulate proliferation, survival, and xenograft implantation of GSC neurosphere lines. Importantly, we found these effects to be independent of lactate homeostasis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of differentially expressed genes revealed an enrichment of DNA replication stress response pathways including cell cycle (G2/M checkpoint), DNA replication, DNA damage response (DDR), and cellular deoxyribonucleotide metabolism in MCT4-depleted GSCs. To validate these data, after lentiviral silencing of MCT4 expression in two GBM neurosphere lines, we examined DNA repair potential by assessing the resolution of yH2AX and by performing alkaline comet assays. In both assays, reduced MCT4 levels resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of nuclear foci (p < 0.0001) and in the percentage of cells with comet tails (p=0.0003), respectively, confirming that reduced MCT4 expression decreases cellular ability to repair DNA damage. Moreover, we show that conditional MCT4 depletion alone (p=0.0001) or in combination with ionizing radiation (p=0.0006) efficiently enhance survival of mice orthotopi- cally implanted with GSC-derived xenografts. We determined that MCT4 inhibition enhances the radiosensitivity of GBM and should be explored as a treatment strategy to complement conventional treatment.",Excluded

Light-induced activation of NF-kappaB and its nuclear localization were studied by immunohistochemistry. The NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in the retinas after exposure to light was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Nuclear transactivation of NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor cells was determined by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. The amount of NF-kappaB p65 in the photoreceptor cells after exposure to light was assessed by Western blot analysis. To obtain more photoreceptor-specific information, microdissected photoreceptor cells were used in some studies.RESULTS: By an immunohistochemical method, the perinuclear region of the photoreceptor cells was heavily labeled with an antibody to activated NF-kappaB after a 1-hour exposure to light. Nuclear localization of NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor nucleus was seen at 12 hours. In the experiments involving 3 hours of exposure to light followed by recovery in the dark, nuclear localization of NF-kappaB was also noted after 12 hours' recovery in the dark. During continuous exposure to light, the NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity gradually increased and reached its maximum at 12 hours. There was an increase of NF-kappaB p65 protein at 3 hours. The mRNA levels of IkappaBalpha were upregulated after 6 hours' exposure to light.CONCLUSIONS: Intense light activated NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor cells in vivo, increased the NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity, and increased the expression of mRNA of IkappaBalpha, a target gene of NF-kappaB.",Excluded

Fractionation was based on the size of the tumor, proximity to the brainstem, and potential risk of neurological sequelae. Median follow-up time was 55.2 months.RESULTS: The pretreatment median tumor diameter was significantly smaller for SRS (1.14 cm) compared with hSRT (1.7 cm) (P = .03) and cfSRT (2.0 cm) (P < .001). The overall local tumor control was 96.4%: 100% SRS, 100% hSRT, and 90% cfSRT (P = .19). Tumor regression was observed in 53.3% of SRS, 76.2% of hSRT, and 90% of cfSRT (P = .05). There was less transient expansion of tumors treated with cfSRT (5%) than with SRS (53.3%) or hSRT (28.6%) (P = .005).

Most prominently, and supported by tumor sequencing data, DAXX functions in concert with alpha thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) as a histone chaperone complex for the H3.3 variant. Studies have also identified potential roles in apoptosis, transcription, and negative regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. Herein, a mouse modeling approach was used to specifically address the latter and no significant genetic interaction between Daxx and the p53 pathway was determined. The embryonic lethal phenotype of Daxx loss is not p53-dependent. In addition, Daxx heterozygosity does not sensitize mice to a sublethal dose of ionizing radiation or alter the survival or tumor phenotype of Mdm2 transgenic mice. However, the data support a tumor suppressor role for DAXX as low-dose ionizing radiation produced a higher proportion of carcinomas in Daxx heterozygous mice than wild-type controls. <b>Implications:</b> While DAXX has important in vivo functions, they are independent of an inhibitory role on the p53 tumor suppressor pathway.

3975,"Gamma knife is effective for type II neurofibromatosisassociated meningioma: A 16-year mayo experience Introduction/Objective: Type 2 neurofibromatosis (NF2) is a debilitating genetic condition characterized by multiple meningiomas, vestibular schwannomas, and other intracranial and intraspinal tumors such as ependymomas. We reported our experience treating a series of NF2-associated meningiomas with Gamma Knife (GK). Method(s): Between January 1992 and December 2008, 16 consecutive patients (7 male, 9 female, age 20 to 81) with 58 intracranial meningiomas were treated with single-fraction GK. Thirty-three tumors (57%) involved the convexity or parasagittal/falx, 25 (43%) skullbased. None of these meningiomas received prior surgery. Nine patients (56%) had more than 1 meningoma (range, 2 to 4) at presentation. Six patients (38%) also had intraspinal meningiomas which were never treated by radiation. All patients had bilateral (81%) or unilateral (19%) vestibular schwannomas. During follow-up, 6 patients (38%) developed 26 (46%) new intracranial meningomas, termed distant progression, requiring secondary treatments. The median prescription dose was 16 Gy (range, 13 to 20), with a maximum dose of 32 Gy (range, 24 to 40). The median heterogeneity index was 2 (range, 1.3 to 2.5). The median tumor diameter and prescription isodose volume were 2.3 cm and 3.6 cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) between GK shots per tumor (median 4, range 1 to 22) versus tumor volume was 0.59. The median radiographic and clinical followup periods were 62 and 86 months, respectively. Result(s): Over a median follow-up period of 3.1 years (range, 0.4 to 14.6), ten patients (63%) required only one treatment, and 6 (37%) required 1 to 6 additional treatments for distant progression. Fifteen (93.8%) patients were alive at last follow-up, with fifty-five tumors (94.8%) controlled (smaller or unchanged in size). Three in-field tumors (5.2%) became larger at 36, 56 and 82 months, respectively, but were not re-treated; they belonged to the same patient who had 14 meningomas treated over 7 times (in 12.7 y). There were no marginal failures. The median time to first radiographic distant progression was 13.7 months (range, 6.2 to 77.5). One minor complication was noted at 12 months, with hemi-body sensory changes which resolved. Two major radiation-related complications occurred at 1 and 3 months, including a 34-year-old woman who died following GK for a parasagittal meningioma. GK-related complication rates remained low overall, and were not associated with tumor volume, location, prescription dose, or chosen isodose level. Conclusion(s): GK is an effective treatment for NF2 patients with meningoma, with 5-year local control rate greater than 90% in our series. Side effects are rare but can be life-threatening including radionecrosis, which may occur within three months after treatment. For NF2 patients who developed distant progression and required repeat treatments elsewhere intracranially, secondary GK appeared safe and equally successful when compared with primary treatment. No high-grade meningoma or secondary non-meningioma malignancy were found as a result of GK radiation exposure.",Excluded

3713,"The effect of TMS on visual motion sensitivity: an increase in neural noise or a decrease in signal strength? The underlying mechanisms of action of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are still a matter of debate. TMS may impair a subject's performance by increasing neural noise, suppressing the neural signal, or both. Here, we delivered a single pulse of TMS (spTMS) to V5/MT during a motion direction discrimination task while concurrently manipulating the level of noise in the motion stimulus. Our results indicate that spTMS essentially acts by suppressing the strength of the relevant visual signal. We suggest that TMS may induce a pattern of neural activity that complements the ongoing activation elicited by the sensory signal in a manner that partially impoverishes that signal.",Excluded
4797,"Medical prevention and treatment of radiation-induced carotid injury Radiotherapy has significantly improved the survival of cancer patients but is also associated with several adversities, including radiation-induced carotid injury (RICI). The RICI mechanisms are complex, including vessel inflammatory injury, carotid atherosclerosis, intimal proliferation, media necrosis, and peri-adventitial fibrosis. The main manifestation and adverse consequence of RICI is carotid artery stenosis (CAS), which can lead to stroke and transient ischemic attack. Currently, carotid artery injury is primarily diagnosed via color-coded duplex sonography. Early detection of traumatic changes in the carotid artery depends on measurements of carotid intima-media thickness; serum biomarker testing also shows great potential. CAS is mainly treated with carotid endarterectomy or carotid angioplasty and stent implantation. Notably, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are advantageous in RICI treatment and reduce carotid inflammation, oxidative stress, and delaying atherosclerosis. This review summarizes the mechanisms, examination methods, and latest treatments for RICI to provide data for its clinical prevention and treatment.",Excluded

In the period of VCD-P, the degree of cognitive decline was similar to aMCI, but they are different in the specific cognitive domains. However whether the differences in cognitive domains are related to the pattern of WM impairment hasn't been illustrated. Hypothesized: The region or degree of WM impairment differs from VCD-P to aMCI. Method(s): All subjects include 28 patients with VCD-P, 34 aMCI and 39 normal controls (NC) underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and DTI. We compared fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AxD) of whole brain WM regions. Then the diffusion tensor was reconstructed, analyzed by tract-based spatial statistics. Result(s): Patient groups exhibited significant differences in FA, MD and AxD, the VCD-P group has a lower FA, higher MD and AxD. The different FA and MD region between VCD-P and aMCI was in left anterior limb of internal capsule, bilateral corona radiata, corpus callosum, cerebral peduncle, external capsule, posterior limb of internal capsule, fornix, inferior longitidinal fasciculus, inferior and superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, whereas in AxD it was showed in bilateral corona radiata, internal capsule, external capsule, corpus callosum, posterior thalamic radiation and superior longitudinal fasciculus. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that VCD-P and aMCI have divergent topography of WM microstructural changes in the degree and the region, the WM integrity was impaired more severe in VCD-P. The differences in regions may illustrate the clinical and neuropsychological features characterized by executive or memory deficit. These findings provide insights into the biological mechanism of cognitive disorders and highlight the potential of DTI as the imaging biomarker for diagnosis.

4586,"Radiation-induced astrogliosis and blood-brain barrier damage can be abrogated using anti-TNF treatment PURPOSE: In this article, we investigate the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in the initiation of acute damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain tissue following radiotherapy (RT) for CNS tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Intravital microscopy and a closed cranial window technique were used to measure quantitatively BBB permeability to FITC-dextran 4.4-kDa molecules, leukocyte adhesion (Rhodamine-6G) and vessel diameters before and after 20-Gy cranial radiation with and without treatment with anti-TNF. Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify astrogliosis post-RT and immunofluorescence was used to visualize protein expression of TNF and ICAM-1 post-RT. Recombinant TNF (rTNF) was used to elucidate the role of TNF in leukocyte adhesion and vessel diameter.RESULTS: Mice treated with anti-TNF showed significantly lower permeability and leukocyte adhesion at 24 and 48 h post-RT vs. RT-only animals. We observed a significant decrease in arteriole diameters at 48 h post-RT that was inhibited in TNF-treated animals. We also saw a significant increase in activated astrocytes following RT that was significantly lower in the anti-TNF-treated group. In addition, immunofluorescence showed protein expression of TNF and ICAM-1 in the cerebral cortex that was inhibited with anti-TNF treatment. Finally, administration of rTNF induced a decrease in arteriole diameter and a significant increase in leukocyte adhesion in venules and arterioles.CONCLUSIONS: TNF plays a significant role in acute changes in BBB permeability, leukocyte adhesion, arteriole diameter, and astrocyte activation following cranial radiation. Treatment with anti-TNF protects the brain's microvascular network from the acute damage following RT.",Included
3792,"Quality of life in the GLARIUS trial randomizing bevacizumab/irinotecan versus temozolomide in newly diagnosed, MGMT-nonmethylated glioblastoma Background The GLARIUS trial, which investigated the efficacy of bevacizumab (BEV)/irinotecan (IRI) compared with standard temozolomide in the first-line therapy of O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)-nonmethylated glioblastoma, showed that progression-free survival was significantly prolonged by BEV/IRI, while overall survival was similar in both arms. The present report focuses on quality of life (QoL) and Karnofsky performance score (KPS) during the whole course of the disease. Methods Patients (n = 170) received standard radiotherapy and were randomized (2:1) for BEV/IRI or standard temozolomide. At least every 3 months KPS was determined and QoL was measured using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Core Quality of Life and 20-item Brain Neoplasm questionnaires. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model evaluated differences in the course of QoL and KPS over time. Also, the time to first deterioration and the time to postprogression deterioration were analyzed separately. Results In all dimensions of QoL and KPS, GEE analyses and time to first deterioration analyses did not detect significant differences between the treatment arms. At progression, 82% of patients receiving second-line therapy in the standard arm received BEV second-line therapy. For the dimensions of motor dysfunction and headaches, time to postprogression deterioration was prolonged in the standard arm receiving crossover second-line BEV in the vast majority of patients at the time of evaluation. Conclusions GLARIUS did not find indications for a BEV-induced detrimental effect on QoL in first-line therapy of MGMT-nonmethylated GBM patients. Moreover, GLARIUS provided some indirect corroborative data supporting the notion that BEV may have beneficial effects upon QoL in relapsed GBM. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2017.",Excluded

Application of protons to a neuron causes a dosedependent decrease in the peak amplitude and acceleration of I<sub>Tau</sub> desensitization. Addition of 100 nM beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) to the perfusate caused acceleration of I<sub>Tau</sub> desensitization. The effects of Abeta and H<sup>+</sup> on the rate of I<sub>Tau</sub> desensitization were not additive. In addition, Abeta attenuated the effect of H<sup>+</sup> on the peak amplitude of I<sub>Tau</sub>.

The innervation and target nerves for radiofrequency denervation (RFD) of the SIJ remain unclear. We present a prospective case series on the treatment of intractable SIJ dysfunction with pulsed radiofrequency denervation (PRFD) of lateral branches from L4-S3.INTERVENTIONS: A total of 126 patients with presumptive SIJ dysfunction based on history and physical examination underwent arthrographically confirmed steroid/local anesthetic SIJ injection. Fifty-two patients (41.3%) had >75% pain relief after two consecutive injections, physical therapy, repeated SIJ injections, and/or analgesics. Twenty-two patients failed to respond. These patients underwent PRFD of the medial branch of L4, posterior primary rami of L5, and lateral branches S1 and S2.OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual analog score (VAS) and quality of life (QOL) assessments were performed prior to and after treatment.RESULTS: Sixteen patients (72.7%) experienced ""Good"" (>50% reduction in VAS), or ""Excellent"" (>80% reduction in VAS) pain relief following PRFD. Duration of pain relief range was 6-9 weeks in four patients, 10-16 weeks in five patients, and 17-32 weeks in seven patients. In addition, QOL scores improved significantly in all measured categories. Six patients (26.1%) did not respond to PRFD and had less than 50% reduction in VAS and were considered failures.CONCLUSIONS: PRFD of the lateral branch of the medial branch of L4, posterior primary rami of L5, and lateral branches S1 and S2 is an effective treatment for some patients with SIJ pain unresponsive to other forms of therapy.",Excluded
3840,"Lipoic and dihydrolipoic acids as antioxidants. A critical evaluation A detailed evaluation of the antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties of lipoic acid (LA) and dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) was performed. Both compounds are powerful scavengers of hypochlorous acid, able to protect alpha 1-antiproteinase against inactivation by HOCl. LA was a powerful scavenger of hydroxyl radicals (OH.) and could inhibit both iron-dependent OH. generation and peroxidation of ox-brain phospholipid liposomes in the presence of FeCl3-ascorbate, presumably by binding iron ions and rendering them redox-inactive. By contrast, DHLA accelerated iron-dependent OH. generation and lipid peroxidation, probably by reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+. LA inhibited this pro-oxidant action of DHLA. However, DHLA did not accelerate DNA degradation by a ferric bleomycin complex and slightly inhibited peroxidation of arachidonic acid by the myoglobin-H2O2 system. Under certain circumstances, DHLA accelerated the loss of activity of alpha-antiproteinase exposed to ionizing radiation under a N2O/O2 atmosphere and also the loss of creatine kinase activity in human plasma exposed to gas-phase cigarette smoke. Neither LA nor DHLA reacted with superoxide radical (O.2-) or H2O2 at significant rates, but both were good scavengers of trichloromethylperoxyl radical (CCl3O2.). We conclude that LA and DHLA have powerful antioxidant properties. However, DHLA can also exert pro-oxidant properties, both by its iron ion-reducing ability and probably by its ability to generate reactive sulphur-containing radicals that can damage certain proteins, such as alpha 1-antiproteinase and creatine kinase.",Excluded
4209,"Light Stress-Induced Increase of Sphingosine 1-Phosphate in Photoreceptors and Its Relevance to Retinal Degeneration Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent lipid mediator that modulates inflammation and angiogenesis. In this study, we investigated the possible involvement of S1P in the pathology of light-induced retinal degeneration in vivo and in vitro. The intracellular S1P and sphingosine kinase (SphK) activity in a photoreceptor cell line (661W cells) was significantly increased by exposure to light. The enhancement of SphK1 expression was dependent on illumination, and all-trans-retinal significantly promoted SphK1 expression. S1P treatment reduced protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation and increased the protein expression of cleaved caspase-3, and induced photoreceptor cell apoptosis. In vivo, light exposure enhanced the expression of SphK1 in the outer segments of photoreceptors. Intravitreal injection of a SphK inhibitor significantly suppressed the thinning of the outer nuclear layer and ameliorated the attenuation of the amplitudes of a-waves and b-waves of electroretinograms during light-induced retinal degeneration. These findings imply that light exposure induces the synthesis of S1P in photoreceptors by upregulating SphK1, which is facilitated by all-trans-retinal, causing retinal degeneration. Inhibition of this enhancement may be a therapeutic target of outer retinal degeneration, including age-related macular degeneration.",Excluded

Reproducibility of each feature between the two time points was calculated within each group to identify a subset of features with distinct reproducible values between two groups. Changes in radiomic features from one time point to the next (delta radiomics) were used to build a model to classify necrosis and progression lesions.RESULTS: A combination of five radiomic features from both T1 post-contrast and T2 MR images were found to be useful in distinguishing necrosis from progression lesions. Delta radiomic features with a RUSBoost ensemble classifier had an overall predictive accuracy of 73.2% and an area under the curve value of 0.73 in leave-one-out cross-validation.CONCLUSIONS: Delta radiomic features extracted from MR images have potential for distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumour progression after radiosurgery for brain metastases.KEY POINTS: * Some radiomic features showed better reproducibility for progressive lesions than necrotic ones * Delta radiomic features can help to distinguish radiation necrosis from tumour progression * Delta radiomic features had better predictive value than did traditional radiomic features.",Excluded

4517,"Challenges and practicalities in the clinical implementation of Lutetium 177 for therapeutic nuclear medicine: A technologist's perspective Objectives: FDA approval of Lutetium177 (Lu177) treatment of neuroendocrine tumor is pending. Lu177 therapy is logistically different than any other currently used radionuclide therapeutic agent. We aim to present a technologist's perspective on potential challenges related to the implementation of Lu177 therapy including developing an institution's policy, identifying needed location/space, supplies, and staff requirements. Method(s): A Lu177 treatment regimen consists of 4 intravenous infusions of 200 mCi at 8 week intervals. Each therapeutic infusion is 4-6 hours, consists of the Lu177 infusion along with an infusion of amino acids and requires nursing supervision. During this process, to reduce radiation exposure, the patient must walk to the restroom every thirty minutes with an IV pole to void. The technologists met with the Authorized Users (AU), the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO), and the other staff involved to review the requirements of radiation safety, workflow, and protocol of this therapy. Result(s): The radioactive materials license is to be amended. It was determined that Lu177 administration would ideally occur in our PET division due to department layout and patient flow. While the general nuclear medicine department has an injection room suited for therapeutic use, the restroom is not in close proximity, which is a radiation safety concern. In our PET center, there are 2 comfortable injection rooms used for long uptake periods located next to a restroom dedicated for radioactive patients. Due to the stated length of the Lu177 therapy session, the PET diagnostic schedule will be reduced on Lu177 therapy days. Lu177 therapies will be scheduled in coordination with other departments including oncology; pharmacy for obtaining amino acids; and nursing for the administration of IV fluids and vital sign monitoring. After the infusion is completed and the injection room is cleaned, radioactive waste will be moved to long term storage. Conclusion(s): Lu177 therapy is an exciting new development in the field of radionuclide therapy: however, its implementation brings new challenges to meet both radiation safety and protocol requirements. Space, workflow, and staffing must all be considered. Lu177 therapies will involve the coordination of AUs, the RSO, technologists, nursing staff, pharmacist, and logistics personnel.

The beta-agonist isoproterenol, caused a 3-fold increase in diurnal enzyme activity. There is thus a marked nyctohemeral variation in T4 activation in the pineal, probably mediated by a beta-adrenergic mechanism.

Apoptosis was quantified using morphology and end-labeling immunohistochemistry, and cell proliferation was detected using antibodies against the thymidine analog BrdU and the cyclin-dependent kinase p34(cdc2). Radiation-induced apoptosis occurred rapidly, with maximum morphological and end-labeling changes observed 3-6h after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation cell proliferation was significantly reduced relative to sham-irradiated controls. The number of apoptotic nuclei increased rapidly with radiation dose, reaching a plateau at about 3Gy. The maximum number of apoptotic nuclei was substantially higher than the number of proliferating cells, suggesting that non-proliferating as well as proliferating cells in the subgranular zone were sensitive to irradiation. Subgranular zone cell proliferation was significantly reduced relative to age-matched controls 120 days after doses of 5Gy or higher. These findings suggest that neural precursor cells of the dentate gyrus are very sensitive to irradiation and are not capable of repopulating the subgranular zone at least up to 120 days after irradiation.

The aim of this study was to quantify late effects in renal cortex of nude mice exposed to high amounts of [(177)Lu]-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate ([(177)Lu]-DOTATATE), and to determine whether a threshold dose value exists for these findings.METHODS: Nude mice were exposed to 90, 120 or 150 MBq of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE. Renal toxicity was evaluated up to 6 months after injection. Blood samples were collected to examine renal functional markers, and after sacrifice at 6 months changes in renal morphology were explored. Tissue damage was estimated by quantifying the relative area of the different subunits in the renal cortex using point counting. Additional morphological signs of radiation damage were also noted. The absorbed doses to the kidneys were estimated by previously determined kidney pharmacokinetics and Monte Carlo simulations for different assumptions regarding the activity distribution.RESULTS: Increased serum creatinine and urea values indicated long-term renal toxicity. The tissue area occupied by proximal tubules decreased with increasing doses of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE, whereas the other subunits in cortex slightly increased. The mean absorbed dose in the renal cortex for [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE was estimated to be 35-58 Gy for the different groups of animals. A dose-response relationship was observed for proximal tubular damage, and a threshold dose value of 24 Gy (BED 37 Gy) was determined.CONCLUSIONS: Selective morphological changes in kidney cortex of nude mice were quantified and appeared in a dose dependent manner after injection of high amounts of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE.",Included

The predominant histologic types were diffuse large cell type, large cell immunoblastic type, and diffuse mixed small and large cell type, seen in 38%, 21% and 21% of cases, respectively. Before 1980, 16 patients were treated with postoperative radiation without definite chemotherapy, and only one has survived more than 5 years. Local recurrence was the most common cause of failure. In 1981, the authors started a protocol in which four to six courses of systemic chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (VEPA) was given after whole brain radiation (30-40 Gy) with a local boost up to 50 to 60 Gy. Eight patients completed this protocol, and all of them are alive at 16 to 100 months after diagnosis, with three patients surviving more than 5 years. Only one patient developed recurrence. On the other hand, six patients who did not complete or receive chemotherapy after 1981 are dead or alive with recurrence. Corelation between the Working Formulation subtype and prognosis was not clear because of the variety of treatment. Two patients receiving chemotherapy developed brain necrosis, which was fatal in one case, and the other two patients treated with the protocol are in a poor state without signs of recurrence. Chemotherapy may enhance the radiation effect on normal brain tissue as well as tumor. Combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy can improve the survival rate, but the optimal dosage needs to be investigated further.",Excluded
4277,"In vivo radiosensitizer effect of the HDAC inhibitor S78454 on orthotopic human glioblastoma Glioblastoma is an aggressive primary brain tumor with poor outcome, despite a treatment associating surgery and radiotherapy combined with temozolomide. Recent data have shown an in vitro synergy of the HDAC inhibitor S78454 (also called PCI- 24781) with ionizing radiation, via inhibition of homologous recombinational (HR) repair of DNA double-strand breaks. We propose in this study to investigate the in vivo radiosensitizer effect of S78454 on human glioblastoma model. For this, we generated orthotopic U87 human glioblastoma xenografts in nude mice. Intra-peritoneal (i.p.) S 78454 treatment was performed daily starting 10 days after the engraftment. Irradiation was performed in one daily 2 Gy localized fraction during 4 days followed by a second similar 4 days treatment performed after 3 days off (for a total dose of 16 Gy administrated on 11 days). Survival experiments were conducted in mice bearing xenografts in the four different groups of treatment (vehicle, S 78454 alone, radiation alone, S 78454 + radiation). Mice bearing orthotopic xenografts were sacrificed at the onset of neurological signs. Survival curves were then performed. We first determined the S78454 dosing schedule to obtain a pharmacodynamic effect of the compound in the xenograft. Inhibition of RAD 51 expression, histone H3 and tubulin acetylation in the tumor were obtained 24 hours after daily i.p. treatment with 50mg/kg S78454. These results allowed us to define the schedule treatment combining S78454 with radiotherapy: mice were treated with S78454 50 mg/kg/d i.p., daily from Days 10 to14 and then from Days 17 to 21; one 2 Gy fraction radiotherapy was performed daily from Days 11 to14 and Days 18 to 21. In these conditions of treatment, S78454 was well tolerated Survival of the mice treated with S78454 alone was not significantly increased while the survival of the mice treated with irradiation alone was significantly increased compared to the control group (P<0.05). In contrast, the survival of the mice treated with the combined treatment was significantly increased compared to the group of animals treated with irradiation alone (P<0.05) and to the group treated with S78454 alone (P<0.01). Effect of S78454 on angiogenesis will be presented. Our results demonstrate that the HDAC inhibitor S78454 radiosensitizes human glioblastoma in vivo and strongly suggest that S78454 may be an interesting drug to combine with radiotherapy in clinical trials for patients with glioblastoma.",Excluded
4576,"Use of the dog spleen for studying effects of irradiation and chemotherapeutic agents, with suggested uses of other organs The irradiation of the exteriorized spleen of the dog, with the animal lead-shielded, produced constant changes in the white blood cells. The time of recovery from the irradiation effect was determined. The normal canine spleen could handle live pneumococci injected into the splenic artery, as proven by sterile cultures of splenic vein samples. The size of the bolus used was determined by repeated trials and proved to be one billion pneumococci per pound of body weight. The capacity of the irradiated spleen to handle this number of pneumococci was impaired. It was found that whole body irradiation, nitrogen mustard, thio-tepa, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vinblastine, and azothioprine all impaired this capacity of the spleen. The dose of the chemotherapeutic agent was the same in milligrams per kilogram as that used in the cancer clinic. A method for determining the recovery time following the use of one or more agents was developed with the repeated use of the spleen model. By extending the methods used with the spleen it was found that similar use could be made, usually without surgery, of the liver, gut, and lungs (and probably the kidney and brain).",Excluded

We have retrospectively analyzed 24 patients treated with IMRT. Five were selected within each of the following regions: head and neck, thoracic, abdomen, and prostate. Four patients were optimized within the brain region. The clinically treated plans were re-optimized using Philips Pinnacle3 v. 8 with the direct machine parameter optimization algorithm. The number of segments per beam from the treated plan was systematically reduced by 80%, 60%, 40%, and 30%, and the following statistics have been analyzed for plan quality: target min, mean, and max doses; critical structure doses; and integral dose. We have attempted to define the smallest number of segments per beam for IMRT treatment plans. Results indicate that IMRT plans can be delivered with acceptable quality with approximately 3-6 segments per beam for the anatomical regions analyzed. A reduction in the number of segments decreases treatment delivery time, reduces machine wear and tear, and minimizes the amount of time the patient is on the treatment table, which in turn reduces the chances of intrafractional uncertainties.",Excluded
4581,"Sacral nerve stimulator use in a patient with low anterior resection syndrome Introduction: Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer are treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgical resection. Advanced surgical techniques such as mesorectal excision have enabled sphincter sparing surgery to be accomplished for patients with distal cancers. Although these procedures are being done more frequently, they remain fraught with both immediate perioperative and long term complications. Fecal Incontinence (FI) is a significant long term postoperative complication which can result following such surgical intervention. While reports show improvement over a 1-2 year period, a significant number of patients continue to experience FI and the so called Low Anterior Syndrome (LAS). Sacral nerve neuromodulation has been traditionally used for treatment of urinary incontinence with the use of Sacral Nerve Stimulator (SNS) implantation and is now being utilized to treat FI. We report the initial successful use of SNS to treat fecal incontinence secondary to radiation and postoperative changes following treatment for rectal cancer. A 70 year old Asian female was diagnosed with stage III rectal cancer and underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by low anterior resection with diverting ileostomy in 2011. Her ostomy was reversed in August 2012 and she developed fecal incontinence. Non-operative measures were taken in attempt to improve her incontinence without success including fiber supplementation and pelvic floor therapy. Method(s): Prior to SNS implantation the patient was given a Cleveland Clinic Fecal Incontinence Score (CCFIS). Patients rate daily incontinence episodes on a 4 point scale in 5 categories including incontinence to solids, liquids, gas, frequency of protective undergarment pads and need to modify lifestyle. A score of 0 in each category is equivalent to never events and a score of 4 is equal to always with 20 being a maximum score. The patient then underwent placement of the SNS probes into the S3 foramen. This was followed by a 1 week test period in which the patient had the probes connected to an external modulator. Following the test phase she then was reassessed with the CCFIS. Result(s): The patients initial CCFIS was the maximum score of 20. Following insertion of the probe at 1 week the patient reported an improvement in her CCFIS to 11. She maintained incontinence to solids usually (score of 3), liquid never (0), gas always (4), use of pads always (4), lifestyle modification never (0). Conclusion(s): Sacral Nerve Stimulator insertion is potentially an effective treatment for fecal incontinence for patients that have undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiation and resection for rectal cancer. Further study is warranted on larger sample sizes to ensure consistency of results and long term outcomes should be measured.",Excluded

CT images, structure sets, and dose files were transferred to the Eclipse treatment planning system for the HyperArc system. Dosimetric parameters for both plans were compared. The beam-on time was calculated from the total monitor unit and dose rate.RESULTS: For normal brain tissue, the received volume doses were significantly lower for HyperArc than for CyberKnife_G4 and strongly correlated with the planning target volume (PTV) for cases of single brain metastasis. In addition, the difference in volume dose between CyberKnife_G4 and HyperArc was proportional to the PTV. For multiple brain metastases, no significant difference was observed between the two stereotactic radiosurgery systems, except for high-dose region in the normal tissue. In low dose for brain minus PTV, when the maximum distance among each target was above 8.0 cm, HyperArc delivered higher dose than CyberKnife_G4. The mean +/- SDs for the beam-on time were 15.8 +/- 5.3 and 5.6 +/- 0.8 min for CyberKnife_G4 and HyperArc, respectively (p < .01).CONCLUSION: HyperArc is best suited for larger targets in single brain metastasis and for smaller inter tumor tumor distances in multiple brain metastases.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The performance of HyperArc in comparison with CyberKnife_G4 was depended on defined margin and tumor distances.",Excluded
4316,"Spherical aberration and glare disability with intraocular lenses of different optical design We implanted several kinds of intraocular lenses (IOLs), calculated the spherical aberration using a computed ray-tracing system, and investigated the correlation between glare disability and spherical aberration and the difference in glare disability among the different IOL types. Type A IOLs (convex-plano), except for those with high power, had the smallest spherical aberration. Type B IOLs (biconvex, anterior more curved) had the smallest spherical aberration at high power. Type D IOLs (biconvex, posterior more curved) had the largest spherical aberration. The correlation between glare disability and spherical aberration was statistically significant for types A, B and C (equiconvex) IOLs. There was no correlation between glare disability and spherical aberration for Type D IOLs, although they showed the smallest glare disability of the four types. These results indicate that the spherical aberration of an IOL, which is calculated by an optical design program, may be a good criterion for selecting an IOL design.",Excluded

4056,"Modulations of nerve growth factor and Bcl-2 in ultraviolet-irradiated human epidermis BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation to the skin causes apoptosis of keratinocytes. Melanocytes are more resistant to UV-induced apoptosis, due, in part, to high levels of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2. In vitro studies have shown that nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophic polypeptide, is produced by keratinocytes and exerts a protective role for melanocytes by upregulating Bcl-2. The purpose of this study was to determine NGF and Bcl-2 modulations in UV-irradiated human skin.METHODS: Nine volunteers were irradiated with two minimal erythema doses using solar-simulated UV irradiation. Seventy-two hours post irradiation, skin biopsies were obtained from irradiated and sun-protected skin. The skin specimens were stained with anti-tyrosinase-related protein-1 monoclonal antibody IgG2a (Mel-5), anti-Bcl-2 (monoclonal antibody IgG-kappa), and with anti-NGF (polyclonal antibody IgG).RESULTS: NGF staining was identified within the cytoplasm of epidermal melanocytes, similar to the staining observed for TRP-1 and Bcl-2. While no significant difference in the number of TRP-1- and Bcl-2-positive melanocytes was observed between irradiated and non-irradiated skin within 72 h, the number of NGF-positive melanocytes decreased significantly, 72 h after UV irradiation (p < 0.024). NGF was also identified within keratinocytes, and while non-irradiated skin exhibited cytoplasmic NGF staining throughout the epidermis, NGF staining was reduced in the lower epidermal layers after UV irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first in vivo study showing NGF to be present in melanocytes, as well as showing modulations of NGF and Bcl-2 in melanocytes, following solar-simulated UV irradiation.",Excluded

Detection and pain thresholds for cold sensations were compared following low frequency (1 Hz) (Experiment 1) and high frequency (20 Hz) (Experiment 2) repetitive TMS. While cold detection threshold was significantly lowered by both rTMS rates, only high frequency rTMS produced a significant change in cold pain threshold. In contrast, sham rTMS did not alter thresholds for cold stimuli. These findings provide evidence that sensory thresholds can be influenced by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.",Excluded
4280,"A novel TNFRSF member, TROY (TNFRSF19), is upregulated in glioblastoma and mediates glioblastoma cell invasion and survival Glioblastoma (GB) is the most malignant form of all primary adult brain tumors. Of the features that characterize GB, arguably none is more clinically significant than the propensity of glioma cells to aggressively invade the surrounding normal brain tissue. These invasive cells render complete resection impossible and confer resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. To improve treatment of malignant glioma, we must find a way to stop the dispersing tumor cells. Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily and their cognate receptors regulate various cellular responses including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. The TROY gene (TNFRSF19) encodes an orphan member of the TNFR superfamily: a type I cell-surface receptor that lacks a cytoplasmic death domain but contains a single TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-binding site. We demonstrate that TROY expression correlates inversely with patient survival and drives GB cell migration and invasion. Our results showed that TROY overexpression in glioma cells activated Rac1 signaling in a Pyk2-dependent manner to drive invasion and migration. Knockdown of TROY in a primary GB xenograft significantly prolonged survival in vivo. In addition, when we activated expression of TROY in mouse astrocytes in vivo using an RCAS vector system for glial-specific gene transfer in G-tva transgenic mice, astrocyte migration was induced within the brain, corroborating the in vitro importance of the TROY signaling cascade in GB invasion. TROY expression significantly increased resistance of GB cells to both IRand TMZ-induced apoptosis in vitro via the Akt and NF-kappaB activation. Inhibition of either Akt or NF-kappaB activity suppressed the survival benefits of TROY signaling in response to TMZ treatment. These findings suggest that the aberrant expression and/or signaling by TROY contributes to, and possibly drives, the malignant dispersion of glioma cells.",Excluded
3719,"Correlation between fissured fibrous cap and contrast enhancement: preliminary results with the use of CTA and histologic validation BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies demonstrated that carotid plaques analyzed by CTA can show contrast plaque enhancement. The purpose of this preliminary work was to evaluate the possible association between the fissured fibrous cap and contrast plaque enhancement.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven consecutive (men = 25; average age = 66.8 +/- 9 years) symptomatic patients studied by use of a multidetector row CT scanner were prospectively analyzed. CTA was performed before and after contrast and radiation doses were recorded; analysis of contrast plaque enhancement was performed. Patients underwent carotid endarterectomy en bloc; histologic sections were prepared and evaluated for fissured fibrous cap and microvessel attenuation. The Mann-Whitney test was performed to evaluate the differences between the 2 groups. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of fissured fibrous cap and microvessel attenuation on contrast plaque enhancement. Receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were also calculated.RESULTS: Twelve patients had fissured fibrous cap. In 92% (11/12) of fissured fibrous cap-positive plaques, we found contrast plaque enhancement, whereas in 69% (24/35) of the plaques without fissured fibrous cap contrast plaque enhancement was found. The Mann-Whitney test showed a statistically significant difference between the contrast enhancement in plaques with fissured fibrous cap (Hounsfield units = 22.6) and without fissured fibrous cap (Hounsfield units = 12.9) (P = .011). On the regression analysis, both fissured fibrous cap and neovascularization were associated with contrast plaque enhancement (P = .0366 and P = .0001). The receiver operating characteristic curve confirmed an association between fissured fibrous cap and contrast plaque enhancement with an area under the curve of 0.749 (P = .005).CONCLUSIONS: The presence of fissured fibrous cap is associated with contrast plaque enhancement. Histologic analysis showed that the presence of fissured fibrous cap is associated with a larger contrast plaque enhancement compared with the contrast plaque enhancement of plaques without fissured fibrous cap.",Excluded
4682,"Non-linear, high-gain and sustained-to-transient signal transmission from rods to amacrine cells in dark-adapted retina of Ambystoma In darkness, On-Off amacrine cells (ACs) of the tiger salamander retina exhibited large spontaneous transient depolarizing potentials (sTDPs) with average peak amplitude of 5.05 +/- 2.5 mV and average frequency of 0.42 +/- 0.25 s(-1). Under voltage-clamp conditions the cell displayed large spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) with average peak amplitude of 98 +/- 39 pA and average frequency of 0.45 +/- 0.22 s(-1). To a light step, ACs gave rise to a transient 'On' response at the light onset and a transient 'Off' response at light offset, followed by a train of TDPs ('After' response). Near the response threshold (0.3 activated rhodopsin molecules per rod per second), light-evoked TDPs (leTDPs) of similar amplitude and kinetics as the large sTDPs observed in darkness were seen, and about half of these leTDPs elicited a regenerative potential (RP). Brighter light steps gave rise to more leTDPs and higher rates of RPs in the On, Off and After responses. Within the linear response range of the rods, the AC response was non-linear, with the highest gain (676 +/- 429) near the dark potential. The amplitude of Off responses increased with the duration of the light step, and ACs may use this to encode speeds of moving stimuli: the faster the light object moves, the smaller the AC Off response. Moreover, the number of leTDPs in the AC After response increased with light intensity, and the onset of the After response coincides with bipolar cell tail response recovery. One possible origin of the large sTDPs and leTDPs is the spontaneous and depolarization-induced regenerative calcium potentials (RCaPs) in bipolar cell synaptic terminals. RCaPs in bipolar cell synaptic terminals cause transient glutamate release that results in the sTDPs in darkness, and leTDPs in On, Off and After responses in ACs.",Excluded

The goal of this study was to review the treatment duration, toxicity, and survival for patients treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiation. Methods Women with stage III-IV endometrial cancer treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation between 2006 and 2013 were included. Toxicities were classified per CTCAE v3.0 and RTOG/EORTC late radiation morbidity scoring. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify treatment and toxicities. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival. Results Fifty-one patients met our inclusion criteria. Median age was 60 (range 33-85). Thirty-six patients (70.6%) had endometrioid histology, 13 patients (25.5%) had serous, clear cell, or mixed histology, and 2 women (3.9%) had carcinosarcoma. Forty-eight patients had stage III disease and three patients were stage IVB. Mean treatment duration was 107 +/- 19 days. Forty-two patients received all planned chemotherapy, and 16 patients required a dose reduction. Thirty-four patients (66.7%) experienced grade 3-4 toxicities, the majority of which were hematologic. There were no deaths related to therapy. Eighty-six percent of patients received leukocyte growth factors, and 25% of patients received a blood transfusion.

4096,"Targeting CREB inhibits radiation-induced neuroendocrine differentiation and increases radiation-induced cell death in prostate cancer cells Neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) is a process by which prostate cancer cells transdifferentiate into neuroendocrine-like (NE-like) cancer cells. Accumulated evidence suggests that NED is associated with disease progression and therapy resistance in prostate cancer patients. We previously reported that by mimicking a clinical radiotherapy protocol, fractionated ionizing radiation (FIR) induces NED in prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, FIR-induced NED constitutes two distinct phases: a radioresistance phase in which a fraction of cells selectively survive during the first two week irradiation, and a neuroendocrine differentiation phase in which surviving cells differentiate into NE-like cancer cells during the second two week irradiation. We have also observed increased activation of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein during the course of FIR-induced NED. To determine whether targeting NED can be explored as a radiosensitization approach, we employed two CREB targeting strategies, CREB knockdown and overexpression of ACREB, a dominant-negative mutant of CREB, to target both phases. Our results showed that ACREB expression increased FIR-induced cell death and sensitized prostate cancer cells to radiation. Consistent with this, knockdown of CREB also inhibited FIR-induced NED and sensitized prostate cancer cells to radiation. Molecular analysis suggests that CREB targeting primarily increases radiation-induced pre-mitotic apoptosis. Taken together, our results suggest that targeting NED could be developed as a radiosensitization approach for prostate cancer radiotherapy.",Excluded

Progesterone receptor immunoreactivity was detected in 70% of tumors. Estrogen receptor immunoreactivity was not detected. An inverse correlation was found between detection of progesterone receptors and the PFPCNA index. The overall 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 68%. The only prognostic factor that significantly affected PFS rate was the PFPCNA index. The 2-year PFS was 42% for tumors with a high PFPCNA index (value > or = 24%) and 91% for tumors with a low PFPCNA index (value < 24%). Tumors with a high PFPCNA index were 9.1 times as likely to recur as were tumors with a low PFPCNA index.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study confirms the value of irradiation for dogs with incompletely resected meningiomas. Prognostic value of the PFPCNA index suggests-that duration of treatment and interval from surgery to start of irradiation may affect outcome. Loss of progesterone receptors in some tumors may be responsible for an increase in PFPCNA index and may indirectly affect prognosis after radiation therapy.",Excluded
4367,"Cryptochromes and inner retinal non-visual irradiance detection Nearly all circadian clocks have free-running periods that differ significantly from 24 hours. To maintain synchrony with the 24 h day, the mammalian circadian clock is reset by light. Unlike other animals, mammalian circadian entrainment occurs exclusively via the eyes and optic nerves. Remarkably, the classical photoreceptors--the rods and cones--are not necessary for photic entrainment. Instead, a subset of inner retinal ganglion cells are directly photoresponsive and transmit photic information specifically to brain centres involved in irradiance detection, including the master circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. The photopigment(s) responsible for inner retinal phototransduction are unknown. Several lines of evidence constrain candidate photopigments. First, near-total vitamin A depletion does not diminish retinohypothalamic signalling. Second, loss of cryptochrome function in retinal-degenerate mice substantially decreases photic signalling to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and markedly decreases pupillary light responses. Third, vitamin A depletion of cryptochrome mutant mice leads to loss of photic signalling to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These findings suggest a model where either classical photopigments or inner retinal photopigments are sufficient for non-visual irradiance detection.",Excluded
3681,"The ATM gene and protein: possible roles in genome surveillance, checkpoint controls and cellular defence against oxidative stress The autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is highly pleiotropic. It is characterized by gradual loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, leading to progressive neuromotor deterioration, immunodeficiency, developmental defects in specific tissues, profound predisposition to malignancy and acute sensitivity to ionizing radiation. AT cells show chromosomal instability, premature senesence, radiosensitivity and defects in cell cycle checkpoints activated by ionizing radiation. Several radiation induced pathways that regulate the cell cycle seem to be defective in AT cells, at least one of which is mediated by TP53. Extensive characterization of the cellular defects of AT cells, together with the recent isolation of the ATM gene, has provided some insight into the possible physiological roles of the ATM protein. Several lines of evidence, including the nature of the agents that elicit the hypersensitivity of AT cells, point to the possibility of a defect in the response to damage induced by oxidative stress, which affects various cellular macromolecules. The ATM protein might have a role in activating defence mechanisms against oxidative stress. This hypothesis broadens the previous concept of the AT defect and explains several aspects of the AT phenotype that cannot be accounted for by defective processing of DNA damage.

One was for a sacral defect after resection of a recurrent fibrosarcoma. All the flaps obtained satisfactory results. Clinical applications revealed that the blood supply of the lateral abdominal skin was mainly from the lateral cutaneous branches of the 9th, 10th and 11th intercostal arteries, among which there were numerous anastomoses. The lateral abdominal island flap can be pedicled with any of these lateral cutaneous branches. The long pedicle of the flap provides a wide range of trnasposition from the axilla to the sacrum. As the pedicle of the flap contains the lateral cutaneous branch of the intercostal nerve, the flap can bring sensation function to the recipient area.

4271,"Standardization of terminology in stereotactic radiosurgery: Report from the Standardization Committee of the International Leksell Gamma Knife Society: special topic OBJECT: This report has been prepared to ensure more uniform reporting of Gamma Knife radiosurgery treatment parameters by identifying areas of controversy, confusion, or imprecision in terminology and recommending standards.METHODS: Several working group discussions supplemented by clarification via email allowed the elaboration of a series of provisional recommendations. These were also discussed in open session at the 16th International Leksell Gamma Knife Society Meeting in Sydney, Australia, in March 2012 and approved subject to certain revisions and the performance of an Internet vote for approval from the whole Society. This ballot was undertaken in September 2012.RESULTS: The recommendations in relation to volumes are that Gross Target Volume (GTV) should replace Target Volume (TV); Prescription Isodose Volume (PIV) should generally be used; the term Treated Target Volume (TTV) should replace TVPIV, GTV in PIV, and so forth; and the Volume of Accepted Tolerance Dose (VATD) should be used in place of irradiated volume. For dose prescription and measurement, the prescription dose should be supplemented by the Absorbed Dose, or DV% (for example, D95%), the maximum and minimum dose should be related to a specific tissue volume (for example, D2% or preferably D1 mm3), and the median dose (D50%) should be recorded routinely. The Integral Dose becomes the Total Absorbed Energy (TAE). In the assessment of planning quality, the use of the Target Coverage Ratio (TTV/ GTV), Paddick Conformity Index (PCI = TTV2/[GTV . PIV]), New Conformity Index (NCI = [GTV . PIV]/TTV2), Selectivity Index (TTV/PIV), Homogeneity Index (HI = [D2% -D98%]/D50%), and Gradient Index (GI = PIV0.5/PIV) are reemphasized. In relation to the dose to Organs at Risk (OARs), the emphasis is on dose volume recording of the VATD or the dose/volume limit (for example, V10) in most cases, with the additional use of a Maximum Dose to a small volume (such as 1 mm3) and/or a Point Dose and Mean Point Dose in certain circumstances, particularly when referring to serial organs. The recommendations were accepted by the International Leksell Gamma Knife Society by a vote of 92% to 8%.CONCLUSIONS: An agreed-upon and uniform terminology and subsequent standardization of certain methods and procedures will advance the clinical science of stereotactic radiosurgery.",Excluded
4231,"Computed tomography versus intravenous urography in diagnosis of acute flank pain from urolithiasis: a randomized study comparing imaging costs and radiation dose The equivalent sensitivity of non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) and intravenous urography (IVU) in the diagnosis of suspected ureteric colic has been established. Approximately 50% of patients with suspected ureteric colic do not have a nephro-urological cause for pain. Because many such patients require further imaging studies, NCCT may obviate the need for these studies and, in so doing, be more cost effective and involve less overall radiation exposure. The present study compares the total imaging cost and radiation dose of NCCT versus IVU in the diagnosis of acute flank pain. Two hundred and twenty-four patients (157 men; mean age 45 years; age range 19-79 years) with suspected renal colic were randomized either to NCCT or IVU. The number of additional diagnostic imaging studies, cost (IVU A$136; CTU A$173), radiation exposure and imaging times were compared. Of 119 (53%) patients with renal obstruction, 105 had no nephro-urological causes of pain. For 21 (20%) of these patients an alternative diagnosis was made at the initial imaging, 10 of which were significant. Of 118 IVU patients, 28 (24%) required 32 additional imaging tests to reach a diagnosis, whereas seven of 106 (6%) NCCT patients required seven additional imaging studies. The average total diagnostic imaging cost for the NCCT group was A$181.94 and A$175.46 for the IVU group (P < 0.43). Mean radiation dose to diagnosis was 5.00 mSv (NCCT) versus 3.50 mSv (IVU) (P < 0.001). Mean imaging time was 30 min (NCCT) versus 75 min (IVU) (P < 0.001). Diagnostic imaging costs were remarkably similar. Although NCCT involves a higher radiation dose than IVU, its advantages of faster diagnosis, the avoidance of additional diagnostic imaging tests and its ability to diagnose other causes makes it the study of choice for acute flank pain at Christchurch Hospital.",Excluded
3766,"Pseudoprogression following chemoradiotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme PURPOSE: Pseudoprogression (psPD) is now recognised following radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide (RT/TMZ) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of psPD following RT/TMZ and the effect of psPD on prognosis.MATERIALS/METHODS: All patients receiving RT/TMZ for newly diagnosed GBM were identified from a prospective database. Clinical and radiographic data were retrospectively reviewed. Early progression was defined as radiological progression (RECIST criteria) during or within eight weeks of completing RT/TMZ. Pseudoprogression was defined as early progression with subsequent disease stabilization, without salvage therapy, for at least six months from completion of RT/TMZ. The primary outcome was overall survival (Kaplan-Meier) and log rank analysis was used to compare groups.RESULTS: Out of 111 patients analyzed, 104 were evaluable for radiological response. Median age was 58 years and median follow-up 55 weeks. Early progression was confirmed in 26% and within this group 32% had psPD. Median survival for the whole cohort was 56.7 weeks [95% CI (51.0, 71.3)]. Median survival for patients with psPD was significantly higher than for patients with true early progression (124.9 weeks versus 36.0 weeks, p = 0.0286).CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one third of patients with early progression were found to have psPD which was associated with a favourable prognosis. Maintenance TMZ should not be abandoned on the basis of seemingly discouraging imaging features identified within the first three months after RT/TMZ.",Excluded
3819,"Exercise as a countermeasure to psycho-physiological deconditioning during long-term confinement Confinement studies are performed to simulate the psychological effects that may be experienced on a long-term space flight. A general psycho-physiological model assumes that mood and cognitive functioning are impaired during confinement as a result of an absence of physical activity. The aim of the MARS500 study initiated by the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) and the European Space Agency (ESA) is to gather data, knowledge and experience to help prepare for a real mission to Mars. A test run with 105 days of isolation was performed prior to 520 days of isolation. Psycho-physiological data of this study are presented here. We hypothesized that exercise, as it has been shown in laboratory settings, would be able to prevent and counteract mood changes during isolation. Electrocortical data (EEG) and a self report on current psychological and physical state were recorded several times prior to and after exercise during the isolation period. Data revealed a clear effect of exercise on mood and electrocortical activity. Moreover, it was shown that mood and brain cortical activity decreased during the first 11 weeks of isolation and reached baseline again in the last week of isolation. A correlation analysis revealed a significant relation between mood data and electrocortical activity. We conclude (1) that confinement is accompanied by psycho-physiological changes and (2) that exercise is a suitable method to counteract psycho-physiological deconditioning during confinement.",Excluded
