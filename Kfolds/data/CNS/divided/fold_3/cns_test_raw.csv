4015,"Surface chemistry governs cellular tropism of nanoparticles in the brain Nanoparticles are of long-standing interest for the treatment of neurological diseases such as glioblastoma. Most past work focused on methods to introduce nanoparticles into the brain, suggesting that reaching the brain interstitium will be sufficient to ensure therapeutic efficacy. However, optimized nanoparticle design for drug delivery to the central nervous system is limited by our understanding of their cellular deposition in the brain. Here, we investigated the cellular fate of poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles presenting different surface chemistries, after administration by convection-enhanced delivery. We demonstrate that nanoparticles with 'stealth' properties mostly avoid internalization by all cell types, but internalization can be enhanced by functionalization with bio-adhesive end-groups. We also show that association rates measured in cultured cells predict the extent of internalization of nanoparticles in cell populations. Finally, evaluating therapeutic efficacy in an orthotopic model of glioblastoma highlights the need to balance significant uptake without inducing adverse toxicity.",Excluded
4346,"Robustness of neural coding in Drosophila photoreceptors in the absence of slow delayed rectifier K+ channels Determining the contribution of a single type of ion channel to information processing within a neuron requires not only knowledge of the properties of the channel but also understanding of its function within a complex system. We studied the contribution of slow delayed rectifier K+ channels to neural coding in Drosophila photoreceptors by combining genetic and electrophysiological approaches with biophysical modeling. We show that the Shab gene encodes the slow delayed rectifier K+ channel and identify a novel voltage-gated K+ conductance. Analysis of the in vivo recorded voltage responses together with their computer-simulated counterparts demonstrates that Shab channels in Drosophila photoreceptors attenuate the light-induced depolarization and prevent response saturation in bright light. We also show that reduction of the Shab conductance in mutant photoreceptors is accompanied by a proportional drop in their input resistance. This reduction in input resistance partially restores the signaling range, sensitivity, and dynamic coding of light intensities of Shab photoreceptors to those of the wild-type counterparts. However, loss of the Shab channels may affect both the energy efficiency of coding and the processing of natural stimuli. Our results highlight the role of different types of voltage-gated K+ channels in the performance of the photoreceptors and provide insight into functional robustness against the perturbation of specific ion channel composition.",Excluded
4237,"Up-regulation of the expression of cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide by electroacupuncture in the arcuate nucleus of diet-induced obese rats It was reported that acupuncture or electro-acupuncture (EA) is effective in reducing the body weight for obese patients, although the mechanisms remain obscure. In a previous study, we have found that rats fed with high-fat (HIF) diet developed diet-induced obesity (DIO) with a concomitant decrease in the hypothalamic content of the cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide, a peptide with anorexiogenic effect. To assess the central effect of EA on DIO rat, we revealed that EA up-regulated the expression of CART peptide in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the DIO rats. After feeding with HIF diet for 14 weeks, the DIO rats received EA stimulation three times per week for 4 weeks. The expression of CART peptide in ARC was measured using immunohistochemistry. The plasma ACTH was measured with ELISA. EA caused a reduction of both body weight and energy intake in DIO rats and increased the expression of CART peptide in ARC. The plasma ACTH was increased in response to restraint stress, but EA produced no further increase in ACTH levels. The results suggest that EA can up-regulate the expression of CART peptide to approach normal level, resulting in an inhibition of food intake and a reduction of body weight in DIO rats.",Excluded
4676,"Effects of gambogic acid on the activation of caspase-3 and downregulation of SIRT1 in RPMI-8226 multiple myeloma cells via the accumulation of ROS Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most commonly diagnosed hematologic malignancy. Although new drugs, including bortezomib and lenalidomide, have improved the treatment landscape for MM patients, MM remains incurable. Therefore, screening for novel anti-myeloma drugs is necessary. Gambogic acid (GA), the main active ingredient of gamboges secreted from the Garcinia hanburryi tree, has been reported to exhibit potent anticancer activity in certain solid tumors and hematological malignancies, while there are few studies that are available concerning its effects on MM cells. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer activity of GA on the MM RPMI-8226 cells and further studied the underlying mechanisms by which GA affected the cells. RPMI-8226 cells were cultured and the effect of GA on cell proliferation was analyzed using MTT assay. Hoechst 33258 staining was used to visualize nuclear fragmentation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected. GA was found to have a significant, dose-dependent effect on growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in RPMI-8226 cells. This activity is associated with the accumulation of ROS, which contributes to the activation of caspase-3 and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), accompanied with apoptosis in RPMI-8226 cells treated with GA. Mammalian SIRT1, as the closest homolog of the yeast Sir2, was extensively involved in regulating cell processes, including cell senescence, aging and neuronal protection, as well as having anti-apoptotic properties. Moreover, SIRT1 overexpression has been shown to protect cancer cells from chemotherapy and ionizing radiation. In the present study, we demonstrated that GA has the potential to downregulate the expression of SIRT1 via ROS accumulation. In conclusion, our study found that GA is able to induce apoptosis in RPMI-8226 cells via ROS accumulation followed by caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage and SIRT1 downregulation. These results suggest that GA may have the potential to not only induce apoptosis in MM cells, but also to decrease the relapse rate of MM.",Excluded

4757,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ameliorates recognition memory impairment induced by hindlimb unloading in mice associated with BDNF/TrkB signaling Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which could improve learning and memory, is widely used in psychiatry and neurology as a therapeutic approach. There are few studies reporting effective countermeasures to cognition decline in astronauts during space flight. Accordingly, we examined whether rTMS was able to significantly alleviate the learning and memory deficits induced by hindlimb unloading (HU), a general accepted rodent model to simulate microgravity, in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four groups: Sham, rTMS, HU, and HU+rTMS groups. The hindlimb unloading procedure continued for consecutive 14 days. Meanwhile, high frequency rTMS (15Hz) was applied for 14 days from the 1<sup>st</sup> day of HU procedure. The novel object recognition test showed that the recognition memory was evidently impaired in the HU group compared to that in the Sham group, however, rTMS significantly attenuated the impairment of the memory. Furthermore, rTMS significantly improved the HU-induced LTP impairment and increased spine density in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region. Additionally, rTMS enhanced the expressions of postsynaptic function-associated proteins N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NR2B and NR2A) and postsynaptic density protein (PSD95), upregulated BDNF/TrkB signaling and increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) in the HU+rTMS group. In conclusion, the data suggest that high frequency rTMS may be an effective countermeasure against the learning and memory deficiency, induced by simulated microgravity.",Excluded
4214,"A method to explore the possibility of nonlocal correlations between brain electrical activities of two spatially separated animal subjects It now appears possible to design an experiment which might reveal whether nonlocal correlations exist between brain electrical activities of spatially separated animal subjects, with initial emphasis on primates and dolphins. This would have the advantage of being based upon research presently being conducted at the University of Washington-Bastyr University and the University of Freiburg, which appears to reveal that a visual evoked potential elicited in the brain of one human subject via patterned photostimulation, can induce a nonlocal transferred potential in the brain of a second human subject, without any apparent classical neural or electromagnetic intervention, since both subjects are in Faraday chambers. An observation of nonlocality may also make it possible to investigate if consciousness or mental experiences exist in various nonhuman animal subjects. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

4481,"[Radiation treatment of metastatic tumor in the brain] Sixty-seven patients with metastatic tumor in the brain were seen from 1975 to Oct. 1985. 11 of the 22 untreated patients were followed to their death, the median survival was 2.9 months. The other 45 patients were all treated by irradiation. 40(89%) patients had bronchogenic carcinoma, three had primaries in other parts of the body and two had unknown primaries. In 16 patients, whole brain was irradiated to a dose of 1000-4000 cGy. Their 6 month survival rate was 25% but all died within one year. In 24 patients, whole brain was first irradiated to 3000-4000 cGy. Then the dose was increased to 5000-6000 cGy by cone down technique. Their 6 month survival was 75%, 1 year survival 33%. The high-dose-cone down method is obviously more effective. In the other 5 patients who were retreated locally for recurrence or new foci in the other parts of the brain, their survival was 4 to 8 months taken from the start of the second course of radiotherapy. One of these five patients is still living as of this writing. Extensive brain necrosis was observed in three patients who received whole brain radiation in the second course. Yet untoward reactions were noted in the two patients who received local irradiation in the second course. This may imply that, for the second course, only local radiation is indicated.",Included

It will conduce to find out effective methods for the prevention and treatment of muscle atrophy during a long-term space flight. Increasing data show that muscle spindle discharges are significantly altered following the hindlimb unloading, suggesting a vital role in the progress of muscle atrophy. In the last decades, we have made a series of studies on changes in the morphological structure and function of muscle spindle following simulated weightlessness. This review will discuss our main results and related researches for understanding of muscle spindle activities during microgravity environment, which may provide a theoretic basis for effective prevention and treatment of muscle atrophy induced by weightlessness.",Excluded

4532,"Photoreceptor damage and eye pigmentation: influence on the sensitivity of rat pineal N-acetyltransferase activity and melatonin levels to light at night The threshold of light irradiance capable of inhibiting nighttime pineal serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and melatonin content, and the importance of intact photoreceptors and eye pigmentation on these changes, were investigated in the rat. Groups of intact albino and black-eyed rats and albino animals with light-induced photoreceptor damage were studied in the dark period before, and after 15 and 30 min of exposure to either 0.0005, 0.175 or 3.33 microW/cm2 irradiance of light. In animals with photoreceptor damage, the sensitivity of the pineal gland to light decreased so that only the highest irradiance tested (3.33 microW/cm2) was capable of totally inhibiting pineal NAT activity and melatonin levels. In one study, pineal NAT and melatonin levels in intact albino rats were inhibited by all three irradiances studied. In a second experiment, albino and black-eyed animals behaved identically, only responding with a depression in pineal NAT and melatonin after exposure to light irradiances of either 0.175 or 3.33 microW/cm2. In conclusion, the lowest irradiance of cool white light capable of inhibiting pineal NAT and melatonin in albino rats is around 0.0005 microW/cm2. At the irradiances studied, photoreceptor damage influences the response of pineal NAT and melatonin to acute light exposure at night. On the other hand, eye pigmentation does not seem to have a major effect on the nighttime inhibition of the pineal by light.",Excluded
4564,"Ribonuclear foci at the neuromuscular junction in myotonic dystrophy type 1 In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) the muscle fibers express RNA containing an expanded CUG repeat (CUG(exp)). The CUG(exp) RNA is retained in the nucleus, forming ribonuclear foci. Splicing factors in the muscleblind (MBNL) family are sequestered in ribonuclear foci, resulting in abnormal regulation of alternative splicing. In extrajunctional nuclei, these effects on splicing regulation lead to reduced chloride conductance and altered insulin receptor signaling. Here we show that CUG(exp) RNA is also expressed in subsynaptic nuclei of muscle fibers and in motor neurons in DM1, causing sequestration of MBNL1 protein in both locations. In a transgenic mouse model, expression of CUG(exp) RNA at high levels in extrajunctional nuclei replicates many features of DM1, but the toxic RNA is poorly expressed in subsynaptic nuclei and the mice fail to develop denervation-like features of DM1 myopathology. Our findings indicate that subsynaptic nuclei and motor neurons are at risk for DM1-induced spliceopathy, which may affect function or stability of the neuromuscular junction.",Excluded

4009,"beta-Amyloid Peptide Antagonizes the Effect of Protons on Taurine-Induced Chloride Current in Rat Hippocampal Pyramidal Neurons Taurine is an important endogenous agonist of glycine receptors (GlyR). Using the patchclamp technique, we measured chloride current induced by a short (600 msec) application of taurine (I<sub>Tau</sub>) on isolated rat pyramidal neurons. pH of taurine solution in the applicator pipette was neutral (7.4) or acidic (7.0-5.0). Application of protons to a neuron causes a dosedependent decrease in the peak amplitude and acceleration of I<sub>Tau</sub> desensitization. Addition of 100 nM beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) to the perfusate caused acceleration of I<sub>Tau</sub> desensitization. The effects of Abeta and H<sup>+</sup> on the rate of I<sub>Tau</sub> desensitization were not additive. In addition, Abeta attenuated the effect of H<sup>+</sup> on the peak amplitude of I<sub>Tau</sub>. We also studied the effect of protons on the chloride current caused by activation of GABA receptors. In contrast to H<sup>+</sup> effects on GlyR, Abeta did not modulate the effects of H<sup>+</sup> on GABA receptors.",Excluded
3666,"Melatonin secretion following brain midline irradiation is diminished, but not correlated with subjective sleep disturbances Objective: Cranial irradiation for brain tumours or leukaemias has been related to cognitive, endocrine and psychosocial late effects as well as sleep disturbances and increased daytime sleepiness. Studies suggest that cranial irradiation might impact on pineal melatonin secretion. Melatonin is an important regulator in human circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle. The objective of this study was to investigate melatonin secretion, subjective sleep parameters and their interplay in a cohort of cranially irradiated head and brain tumour and leukaemia survivors at least 3 years after radiotherapy. Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Patient(s): Thirty-eight adults. Measurements: Melatonin secretion was evaluated by measuring its metabolite 6-sulphatoxymelatonin in collected overnight urine. Subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The Beck Depression Inventory II was used to screen for depressive symptoms because of their impact on sleep. Result(s): Patients irradiated in the brain midline had significantly lower melatonin secretion (P = 0.008). Subjects exhibited a high prevalence of sleeping difficulties, daytime sleepiness and depression, with females and overweight subjects particularly affected. Melatonin values and subjective sleep parameters did not correlate with each other or with treatment and most patient variables. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that radiation exposure to the pineal gland negatively affects melatonin secretion. This lack of pineal melatonin does not influence subjective sleep quality. As melatonin has important antioxidant and cancer-protective effects, further research is necessary to elucidate whether these patients have an increased risk of developing secondary neoplasms and other radiation late effects.

4590,"Developing optic radiation tractography to reduce visual field deficits following anterior temporal lobe resection Objectives: Anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR) is an effective treatment for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. Damage to Meyer's loop of the optic radiation (OR) leads to postop visual field deficits (VFD) in 52-100% of patients and may prevent driving. The OR cannot be seen on clinical MRI sequences, but can be visualised using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. Incorporating these data into the neuronavigational system during surgery should reduce the risk of VFD. However, preop tractography is no longer valid due to brain shift/distortion. A new image registration technique to compensate for brain shift/distortion is described and validated it in a cohort of patients undergoing ATLR with the aim of using this to guide future neurosurgery. Method(s): Pre-/postop structural MRI and DTI scans were acquired on 16 patients undergoing ATLR. The OR was delinetaed using probabilistic tractography on preop data and propagated onto postop structural images using a novel image registration technique. Degree of resection was quantified by the maximum A-P distance between the anterior of the OR on the propagated tractography and the resection margin. Postop VFD was quantified as percentage of upper quadrant lost using Goldmann perimetry. Result(s): Postop VFD were seen in 8 patients (10-92% of the upper quadrant, mean 51%). In 8 patients without VFD, the propagated OR was 0.0-15.0 (mean 3.4 mm) posterior to the resection margin. In 8 patients with VFD, the propagated OR lay 3.8-15.9 (mean 7.7 mm) anterior to the resection margin. The Pearson correlation coefficient between A-P distance and VFD was 0.809 (one-tailed p = 0.008). Linear regression showed for each additional 1 mm of resection, 5.8% more upper quadrant vision was lost. Mean image registration time by implementation on a GPU (graphical processing unit) was 3.2 min. Conclusion(s): A novel non-linear registration algorithm was used to propagate preop OR tractography onto postop images. Results obtained were highly predictive of the VFD. MRI and DTI scans can be acquired during surgery in an interventional MRI suite. As transfer of the patient from the MRI scanner back to the operating table takes 7-10 min, the algorithm is fast enough to be applied to propagate preop tractography onto intraop images before surgery recommences. Future work will display the propagated tractography to the surgeon in the neuronavigation system to determine whether this additional information can reduce the risk of a VFD.",Excluded

3937,"Clinical acceptability of SRS treatment of two simultaneous targets with varying magnitudes of rotation error Purpose/Objective(s): We investigated the target rotational errors (i.e., pitch, roll, yaw) and evaluated the dosimetric impact of simultaneous treatment ofmultiple brain lesionswith amono-isocentric technique of using image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery. The Elekta Synergy S with dissociated simultaneous multiple port (dose islands) within a single field. This simultaneous-treatment technique enables us to more efficiently treat two lesions concurrently when each target conforms to the radiosurgery protocol. Materials/Methods:We created a clinical reference plan (CRP), which has optimized dose coverage, conformity, homogeneity, and step-wise fall-off to zero dose.We then applied orthogonal-to-spherical coordinate system transformations about the isocenter, to each individual beam's parameters that simulated the multiple rotational errors for this research. For each patient (n = 10) 24 experimental treatment plan (ETP) calculations were. For each ETP , DVHs were computed for the two PTVs, optic nerves, optic chiasm and brainstem. From all of the DVH data, critical analytical indices were computed and compared to the CRP. These analytical indices include: Coverage, conformity, Dose Homogeneity, and Dose Gradient. A neurosurgical team evaluated the plans and subjectively evaluated the clinical suitability of each plan. The accumulated indices were scored and weighted to obtain a single value, the Unified Dosimetry Index (UDI). The UDI represents a plan's suitability vis-a-vis the CRP. Result(s): From the computed UDIs we observed that ETPs with 1-2 degrees of rotation remain within the defined range of suitability for clinical treatment. Rotation errors greater than 2 degrees resulted in UDI outside the clinically acceptable range. Conclusion(s): Isocenter rotations of 3 degrees or more significantly reduces the quality of clinical SRS treatments. Small lesions are especially vulnerable to loss of dosimetric coverage. SRS treatment setup should have a combined rotational error less than 2.5 degrees to effectively deliver the prescribed radiation dose using multiple brain lesions with mono-isocentric technique.",Excluded
3959,"The ketone body s-hydroxybutyrate radiosensitizes glioblastoma multiforme stem cells Glioblastomamultiforme (GBM) is amalignant brain tumor that typically recurs following standard treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. A rare population of radio-chemoresistant glioma stem cells (GSCs) is implicated in tumor repopulation and progression following treatment. Improvement in the prognosis of these patients requires the development of new therapeutic approaches. One emerging strategy is to target aberrant cell metabolism, a trait shared by virtually all tumor cells. The ketogenic diet (KD), a high fat, low carbohydrate and protein metabolic therapy has demonstrated anti-tumor effects alone, and in combination with radiation. The KD prolongs survival in animal glioma models, and when used in conjunction with radiation 9 of 11micewere cured of their implanted tumors. We are now extending this work to determine if the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) radiosensitizes human GSCs in vitro. The effects of betaHB on growth were examined at various betaHB concentrations in two GSC lines, L0andL1. Both 5mM and 10 mM betaHB significantly reduced GSC growth. When coupled with 4Gy of radiation, 5mM betaHB treatment significantly reduced L1 neurosphere formation and frequency, more than either betaHB treatment or radiation alone. In L0, combination treatment significantly reduced neurosphere formation and frequency, more than radiation alone. To explore underlying mechanisms we are investigating the effect of betaHB on DNA damage and repair in GSCs. Additionally, we are determining the effect of betaHB on hypoxia within GSC neurospheres by analyzing expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha and the hypoxic marker carbonic anhydrase 9. We previously showed that the KD reduced the expression of these genes in a mouse glioma model. Taken altogether, these data suggest that betaHB may sensitize GBMs to radiation by inhibiting growth of both glioma cells and GSCs, which may have implications for its use to treat tumor recurrence.",Excluded
4417,"Salvage Free Tissue Transfer for Clival Osteoradionecrosis After Repeat Proton Beam Therapy BACKGROUND: Craniocervical junction chordoma treated with surgery and Proton Beam Therapy evolved with Osteonecrosis and CSF leak. As the vascularization of the head was compromised, we harvested an Anterolateral thigh musculofascial flap to seal the leak.CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old man presented with a history of chronic headaches and dysarthria with tongue deviation to the right. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lesion at the craniocervical junction with imaging characteristics compatible with chordoma. Endoscopic endonasal resection was followed by proton beam therapy. Recurrence of the chordoma was subsequently resected via far lateral approach again followed by proton beam therapy accumulating a total dose of 75 Gy. Unfortunately, this led to osteoradionecrosis of the skull base resulting in a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak more than 1 year after treatment. After multiple failed attempts to seal the defect using local vascularized tissue and free fat grafts, the defect was reconstructed with a vastus lateralis free tissue transfer. Six weeks later, the flap had mucosalized, the patient was pain free, and there was no evidence of a CSF leak.CONCLUSIONS: In select cases, vascularized free flaps offer a superior reconstruction for osteoradionecrosis because radiotherapy often compromises the blood supply of local tissues.",Excluded

Dose-dependent incidence of the fibrinoid necrosis increased between 41 and 87 weeks after irradiation. Mean score of fibrinoid necrosis increased dose dependently approximately 60 weeks after irradiation.

Neurological complications caused by radiation of the spinal cord are ascribed to progressive, irreversible damage to the vasculature. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is known to induce angiogenesis in irradiated tissue and has been proven to reduce late radiation injury in several normal tissues when applied during the latent period before complications become manifest. In the present study: (1) the prophylactic potential of HBO; (2) optimal timing of HBO therapy after spinal cord irradiation, i.e. during the latent period; and (3) effect of HBO on the re-irradiation tolerance of the spinal cord were investigated. The rat cervical spinal cord was locally X-ray irradiated with ten fractions of 6.5 Gy in 11 days. Five treatment groups (n=10) included: irradiation alone and irradiation followed by 30 HBO treatments (100% oxygen at 240 kPa for 90 min) during latency, with HBO starting either immediately, 5, 10 or 15 weeks after the primary irradiation course. One year after the primary treatment, the same spinal cord volume was re-irradiated with 20 Gy single dose. During life span, the animals were observed on the incidence of myelitis and the duration of the latent period. The actuarial analysis revealed no significant difference in neurological complications free survival between the irradiation alone and the irradiation+HBO treatment groups. A tendency towards radiosensitization was found in the group in which the primary irradiation course was immediately followed by the HBO treatment course. The data show that HBO applied during the latent period of progressively developing irradiation damage to the spinal cord does not increase the re-irradiation tolerance of this tissue. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

4405,"Role of nanomedicine in treatment of brain cancer Background: Drug delivery to cancerous brain is a challenging task as it is surrounded by an efficient protective barrier. The main hurdles for delivery of bioactive molecules to cancerous brain are blood brain barrier (BBB), the invasive nature of gliomas, drug resistance, and difficult brain interstitium transportation. Therefore, treatment of brain cancer with the available drug regimen is difficult and has shown little improvement in recent years. Method(s): We searched about recent advancements in the use of nanomedicine for effective treatment of the brain cancer. We focused on the use of liposomes, nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and dendrimers to improve brain cancer therapy. Result(s): Nanomedicines are well suited for the treatment of brain cancer owing to their highly acceptable biological, chemical, and physical properties. Smaller size of nanomedicines also enhances their anticancer potential and penetration into blood brain barrier (BBB). Conclusion(s): Recently, nanomedicine based approaches have been developed and investigated for effective treatment of brain cancer.

4267,"De Novo Development of Moyamoya Disease after Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Arteriovenous Malformation in a Patient With RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys (rs112735431) BACKGROUND: Reports of cases diagnosed as Moyamoya disease (MMD) after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are extremely rare. In recent years, ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) has been identified as a susceptibility gene of MMD, but the mechanism by which MMD develops remains unclear. Those cases of de novo development of MMD may provide some clues to clarify the mechanism of progression of MMD.CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of de novo MMD that developed after SRS for AVM. This patient presented with a variant of the RNF213 gene. The intracranial internal carotid artery was not within the irradiation field; therefore it was obvious that the development of MMD was not caused by the direct effect of radiation in the current case study. Moreover, we demonstrated the decrease in velocity in the internal carotid artery prior to the development of MMD using phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography. Previous studies demonstrated that progression of the pathological condition in the cerebral arteries in response to hemodynamic changes is enhanced in patients with RNF213 variants.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the changes in the intracranial hemodynamics after SRS for AVM could trigger the de novo onset of MMD in patients with a genetic predisposition for the RNF213 variant.",Excluded
4224,"Thermography for perfusion analysis of the thoracic region after bypass grafting The use of the left internal thoracic artery for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is associated with higher long-term patency rates compared to autologous saphenous vein grafts. However, due to the devascularisation of the thoracic region there is a potential of postoperative sternal wound infection, occurring in approximately 4 % of all patients. To this day, there is still no preoperative diagnostic procedure to estimate the risk of a wound healing disorder. Thermography has proved to be suitable for medical imaging in breast cancer detection, brain mapping in neurosurgery, and dermatology among others. The measurement of thermal radiation is a highly sensitive, noninvasive and label-free methodology that allows for the identification of vital signs and the discrimination of normal from pathological tissue. In this contribution, thermal imaging is used to quantify the perfusion of the thoracic region of patients before and after CABG. We propose a method for the assessment of blood flow by evaluating the skin temperature of the left and right breast areas in a comparative study 1 day before the surgery and 2 hours, 1 day, and 7 days after surgery, respectively. As expected, the examined group of patients showed a hypoperfusion of left chest wall, indicated by a significant temperature drop compared to the right breast area. Postoperative we observe a continuous convergence in the skin temperatures of the left and right breast areas as an effect of revascularization in the left thoracic region. As a proof of concept, we show the feasibility to evaluate the perfusion of the thoracic region using contact-free thermal imaging. This lays the foundation for preoperative diagnostics in order to assess the risk of wound healing disorders.",Excluded
4279,"A novel TNFRSF member, TROY (TNFRSF19), is upregulated in glioblastoma and mediates glioblastoma cell invasion and survival Glioblastoma (GB) is the most malignant form of all primary adult brain tumors. Of the features that characterize GB, arguably none is more clinically significant than the propensity of glioma cells to aggressively invade the surrounding normal brain tissue. These invasive cells render complete resection impossible and confer resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. To improve treatment of malignant glioma, we must find a way to stop the dispersing tumor cells. Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily and their cognate receptors regulate various cellular responses including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. The TROY gene (TNFRSF19) encodes an orphan member of the TNFR superfamily: a type I cell-surface receptor that lacks a cytoplasmic death domain but contains a single TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-binding site. We demonstrate that TROY expression correlates inversely with patient survival and drives GB cell migration and invasion. Our results showed that TROY overexpression in glioma cells activated Rac1 signaling in a Pyk2-dependent manner to drive invasion and migration. Knockdown of TROY in a primary GB xenograft significantly prolonged survival in vivo. In addition, when we activated expression of TROY in mouse astrocytes in vivo using an RCAS vector system for glial-specific gene transfer in G-tva transgenic mice, astrocyte migration was induced within the brain, corroborating the in vitro importance of the TROY signaling cascade in GB invasion. TROY expression significantly increased resistance of GB cells to both IRand TMZ-induced apoptosis in vitro via the Akt and NF-kappaB activation. Inhibition of either Akt or NF-kappaB activity suppressed the survival benefits of TROY signaling in response to TMZ treatment. These findings suggest that the aberrant expression and/or signaling by TROY contributes to, and possibly drives, the malignant dispersion of glioma cells.",Excluded
4419,"Gamma probe-assisted brain tumor microsurgical resection: a new technique OBJECTIVES: The pioneering performance of gamma probe-assisted surgery (GPAS) for brain tumors, aiming not only an improvement of tumor detection, but mainly assurance of its complete removal and the study of the usual distribution of the 99mTc-MIBI in the brain SPECT of normal individuals.METHOD: Patient's informed consent and demonstration of the tumor by the preoperative MIBI SPECT were the inclusion criteria adopted for GPAS, which was performed in one patient with a right parietal lobe metastatic tumor. The radiotracer (99mTc-MIBI) was injected in a peripheral vein 5 hours before the operation. A tumor to-normal tissue count ratio equal to or greater than 2/1 was considered indicative of tumor. MIBI SPECT was performed in five normal individuals in a pilot study.RESULTS: The gamma probe greatly facilitated intraoperative tumor detection (tumor to-normal brain count ratio was 5/1) and indicated a small piece of residual tumor after what was thought to be a complete tumor removal, allowing its resection, which, otherwise, would have been left behind. Postoperative CT confirmed complete tumor resection. The MIBI SPECT in normal individuals showed an increased uptake by the hypophisis, choroid plexus, skull, scalp and salivary glands and absence of uptake by the normal brain tissue. There were no complications.CONCLUSION: GPAS proved to be, in this single case, a safe and reliable technique to improve brain tumor detection and to confirm the presence or absence of residual tumor.",Excluded
4281,"A rare cause of GI bleeding: Metastatic lung adenocarcinoma to the ileum Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer and commonly metastasizes to the bone, adrenal glands, liver, and brain. Intestinal metastasis is infrequent and clinical manifestations of this are even rarer. We present a case of metastatic adenocarcinoma to the ileum in a patient presenting with passing dark red blood from his rectum. A 60 year-old male, with past medical history of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung to the brain, status-post left lower lung lobectomy and craniotomy with right frontal partial lobectomy, a remote history of cerebrovascular accident on current anti-platelet therapy, and residual dysphagia on gastric tube feeds, presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and generalized weakness for 1 week. He had completed chemotherapy and radiation 3 months prior. Vomiting and loose stools occurred after feeds. Initial evaluation revealed a cachectic man with decreased air entry and rhonchi on pulmonary exam, and a soft, non-distended abdomen. Vitals were significant for hypotension, 90/50mmHg. On day 2 of hospitalization, the patient had hematochezia and a drop in hemoglobin from 8.1g/dL to 6.2g/dL. He was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells. Gastroenterology was consulted for continued rectal bleeding and performed a colonoscopy. Blood clots were present throughout the colon and a 4 centimeter submucosal mass with ulceration of the overlying mucosa was visualized in the ileum, narrowing the lumen (Image A, B). Tattoo ink was injected proximal and distal to the lesion, and multiple biopsies were taken. He was evaluated for surgery, however given his advanced disease and multiple co-morbidities, he would not be a surgical candidate. Results of the pathology confirmed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, with immunohistochemistry consistent with lung primary. Hematochezia subsided and after discussion with the family, they opted for comfort care with hospice.

4300,"A ciliary opsin in the brain of a marine annelid zooplankton is ultraviolet-sensitive, and the sensitivity is tuned by a single amino acid residue Ciliary opsins were classically thought to function only in vertebrates for vision, but they have also been identified recently in invertebrates for non-visual photoreception. Larvae of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii are used as a zooplankton model, and this zooplankton species possesses a ""vertebrate-type"" ciliary opsin (named c-opsin) in the brain. Platynereis c-opsin is suggested to relay light signals for melatonin production and circadian behaviors. Thus, the spectral and biochemical characteristics of this c-opsin would be directly related to non-visual photoreception in this zooplankton model. Here we demonstrate that the c-opsin can sense UV to activate intracellular signaling cascades and that it can directly bind exogenous all-trans-retinal. These results suggest that this c-opsin regulates circadian signaling in a UV-dependent manner and that it does not require a supply of 11-cis-retinal for photoreception. Avoidance of damaging UV irradiation is a major cause of large-scale daily zooplankton movement, and the observed capability of the c-opsin to transmit UV signals and bind all-trans-retinal is ideally suited for sensing UV radiation in the brain, which presumably lacks enzymes producing 11-cis-retinal. Mutagenesis analyses indicated that a unique amino acid residue (Lys-94) is responsible for c-opsin-mediated UV sensing in the Platynereis brain. We therefore propose that acquisition of the lysine residue in the c-opsin would be a critical event in the evolution of Platynereis to enable detection of ambient UV light. In summary, our findings indicate that the c-opsin possesses spectral and biochemical properties suitable for UV sensing by the zooplankton model.",Excluded

4764,"Acute effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic field emitted by mobile phone on brain function Due to its attributes, characteristics, and technological resources, the mobile phone (MP) has become one of the most commonly used communication devices. Historically, ample evidence has ruled out the substantial short-term impact of radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) emitted by MP on human cognitive performance. However, more recent evidence suggests potential harmful effects associated with MP EMF exposure. The aim of this review is to readdress the question of whether the effect of MP EMF exposure on brain function should be reopened. We strengthen our argument focusing on recent neuroimaging and electroencephalography studies, in order to present a more specific analysis of effects of MP EMF exposure on neurocognitive function. Several studies indicate an increase in cortical excitability and/or efficiency with EMF exposure, which appears to be more prominent in fronto-temporal regions and has been associated with faster reaction time. Cortical excitability might also underpin disruption to sleep. However, several inconsistent findings exist, and conclusions regarding adverse effects of EMF exposure are currently limited. It also should be noted that the crucial scientific question of the effect of longer-term MP EMF exposure on brain function remains unanswered and essentially unaddressed.

4701,"Altered expression of glutamate transporter GLAST mRNA in rat brain after photochemically induced focal ischemia BACKGROUND: The neurotransmitter glutamate is involved in fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain. Glutamate released from presynaptic terminals must be removed rapidly from the synaptic cleft by high affinity, sodium-dependent glutamate transporters to keep the extracellular glutamate concentration low to protect neuron from glutamate excitotoxicity, which is the major pathological mechanism of brain ischemia. GLAST is one of the identified four subtypes of the glutamate transporter system and has been suggested to play an important role in some pathological conditions. But until recently, very little information existed the concerning relationship between GLAST expression and cerebral ischemia.METHODS: Nonradioactive in situ hybridization was employed to evaluate the changes of glutamate transporter GLAST mRNA expression in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus following photochemically induced focal cortical ischemia.RESULTS: GLAST mRNA expression in cerebral pyramid cells below the infarcted area did not change at 3 h, significantly decreased at 12 h, recovered to the control level at 24 h, and significantly increased at 72 h following the ischemic lesion. No changes in GLAST mRNA expression were observed in all subfields of the hippocampal complex.CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that the time-course changes of GLAST mRNA expression after ischemia may be correlated with the pathogenesis of photosensitive ischemic brain damage.",Excluded

We aimed to establish translatable mouse models of disseminated prostate cancer (PCa) to evaluate effectiveness of <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-617 at various disease stages. <b>Methods</b>: C4-2, C4-2B, or 22Rv1 cells were injected into the left ventricle of male NSG mice. Disease progression was monitored using bioluminescence imaging (BLI). For treatment, mice were injected with 40 kBq <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-617 at one (early treatment cohort) or three weeks (late treatment cohort) post-inoculation. Treatment efficacy was monitored by BLI of whole-body tumor burden. Mice were sacrificed based on body conditioning score. <b>Results</b>: C4-2 cells yielded metastases in liver, lungs, spleen, stomach, bones, and brain - achieving a clinically relevant model of widespread metastatic disease. The disease burden in the early treatment cohort was stable over 27 weeks in 5/9 mice and progressive in 4/9 mice. These mice were sacrificed due to brain metastases. Median survival of the late treatment cohort was superior to controls (13 vs. 7 weeks; p<0.0001) but inferior to that in the early treatment cohort (13 vs. 27 weeks; p<0.001). Late cohort mice succumbed to extensive liver involvement.

APBI was delivered using 3-dimensional CRT (n = 29) or with SAVI (n = 176), Contura (n = 56), or MammoSite (n = 20) brachytherapy catheters. Patients were evaluated at protocol-specified intervals, at which time the radiation oncologist scored cosmetic outcome, toxicities, and recurrence status using a standardized template.RESULTS: The median follow-up time is 41 months. Grade 1 seroma and fibrosis were more common with brachytherapy than with 3-dimensional CRT (50.4% vs 3.4% for seroma; P < .0001 and 66.3% vs 44.8% for fibrosis; P = .02), but grade 1 edema was more common with 3-dimensional CRT than with brachytherapy (17.2% vs 5.6%; P = .04). Grade 2 to 3 pain was more common with 3-dimensional CRT (17.2% vs 5.2%; P = .03). Actuarial 5-year rates of fair or poor radiation oncologist-reported cosmetic outcome were 9% for 3-dimensional CRT and 24% for brachytherapy (P = .13). Brachytherapy was significantly associated with inferior cosmesis on mixed model analysis (P = .003). Significant predictors of reduced risk of adverse cosmetic outcome after brachytherapy were D0.1cc (skin) <=102%, minimum skin distance >5.1 mm, dose homogeneity index >0.54, and volume of nonconformance <=0.89 cc. The 5-year ipsilateral breast recurrence was 4.3% for brachytherapy and 4.2% for 3-dimensional CRT APBI patients (P = .95).CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy APBI is associated with higher rates of grade 1 fibrosis and seroma than 3-dimensional CRT but lower rates of grade 1 edema and grade 2 to 3 pain than 3-dimensional CRT. Rates of radiation oncologist-reported fair or poor cosmetic outcomes are higher with brachytherapy.

A 0.3-kb cDNA that was consistently observed in irradiated cultures but not in unirradiated cultures was cloned and sequenced. It was found to be identical to Ptk-3, a receptor tyrosine kinase gene identified recently. The protein encoded by Ptk-3 is a member of a novel class of receptor tyrosine kinases whose extracellular domain contains regions of homology with coagulation factors V and VIII and complement component C1. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of Ptk-3 was increased in rat astrocytes by 0.5 h after exposure to 10 Gy and remained at the same elevated level for at least 24 h. The maximum increase occurred after 5 Gy. Cloning studies indicated the presence of at least two Ptk-3 mRNA transcripts, which are probably the result of an alternative splicing mechanism. The short isoform lacks a 37-amino acid sequence in the glycine/proline-rich juxtamembrane region. The splicing pattern of the Ptk-3 gene was not altered by radiation.

The situations of these patients in 1993 and 2005 were compared to detect similarities, differences and developments. In the years 1993 and 2005, 37 and 36 patients, respectively, with head and neck cancer treated by the local departments of otorhinolaryngology and of radiotherapy were examined consecutively according to their aftercare appointments. Time points of radiotherapy treatment of the patients evaluated in 1993 varied from 1984 to 1993. The patients evaluated in 2005 had received radiotherapy between 1998 and 2005. Therefore the applied radiotherapeutic regimen differed not only between the two groups of patients, but also within each group. The information for these investigations was provided anonymously. It was evaluated with descriptive statistics. The evaluation of the data shows distinct differences with respect to preventive and therapeutic dental care measures. In 2005, 35 out of 36 patients (97.2%) had a dental consultation before radiotherapy (1993, 65%). All 27 dentate patients (100%) obtained a splint for fluoride application (1993, none). 29% fewer edentulous patients were seen than in 1993. The number of teeth destroyed decreased from 19.2% (1993) to 7.8% in 2005. Mycoses due to Candida spp. and chronic failures in wound healing were rare (5.5%).

Levels of pineal gland melatonin were measured twice daily--10:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.--10 days after initial light treatment. Thirty additional guinea pigs were also assigned to these groups and treated similarly. For these latter animals, refractive status, ocular length, and vitreous depth were measured before and after light treatment. Eight weeks after light treatment, retinal and sceral levels of melanopsin, melatonin receptor type (MT) 1, and mRNA protein were determined by Western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: The level of pineal gland melatonin in the green-light group was significantly higher than that in the blue-light group. Biometric measurements showed that guinea pigs in the green-light group had a somewhat myopic refractive status. Expressions of retinal melanopsin mRNA and protein were significantly higher in the blue-light group and lower in the green-light group when compared to controls. Conversely, expressions of MT1 receptor mRNA and protein in retina and sclera were significantly higher in the green-light group and lower in the blue-light group when compared to controls.CONCLUSIONS: Green light appears to suppress induction of melatonin production.

The index date was the first date of metastasis diagnosis. Patients were followed from the index date to death, disenrollment, or end of the study period (6/30/2010), whichever occurred first. Surgery, radiation, and systemic therapies were examined descriptively. Factors influencing treatment were examined using a logistic regression separately for surgery, radiation, and systemic therapy. RESULT(S): A total of 2546 patients with metastatic melanoma were included in the analyses. Mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 60.6 (+/- 14.0) years old with 22.8% under 50 and 36.5% were female. Overall, 66.8% of patients had cancer treatment related surgery, 38.7% received systemic therapies, 44.7% received radiation, and 17.7% of patients received all three treatments. Logistic regressions revealed that patients with lung (p <0.0001), brain (p <0.0001), liver (p <0.0001), or bone (p <0.0001) metastases were less likely to have surgeries; patients with lung (p = 0.04), brain (p < 0.001), or liver metastases (p = 0.03) were more likely to receive systemic therapies; as expected patients with brain (p < 0.0001) or bone metastases (p < 0.0001) were more likely to have radiation therapy. Patients being treated by oncologists were more likely to receive systemic therapy (p < 0.0001) or radiation (p < 0.0001) while patients being treated by dermatologists were more likely to receive surgery subsequently (p = 0.002). Older age and female gender were associated with a lower likelihood to receive surgery, systemic, or radiation therapy.

Ten healthy men ages 19 to 37 took part in the study. EEG was recor- ded daily over the 25 days test period that was marked by C- and M-class solar flares and geomagnetic storm levels in the G2-G3 range. The EEG signals were used for the estimate of the mul-tivariate temporal structure function (SF) of the first order in 8-dimensional space. The value of the SF correlation radius is used here as an estimation of a scale of the integral temporal correlation structure of multi-channel EEG, while the value of the SF horizontal asymptote is used as an estimation of the spatial correlation structure of EEG. It is shown that GMA variations make an even greater impact on the SF correlation radius, than on the SF asymptote. We reveal the disturbing and modulating effects of geomagnetic and solar activity on the SF parameters and its power spectrum.

We explored the combination of intermediate stereotactic dose radiation therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy as a novel treatment strategy for GBM.METHODS: Glioma xenograft-bearing mice were exposed to high dose brain-directed radiation (10 Gy single exposure) as well as mouse anti-PD-1 antibody. The tumor-bearing animals were randomized to four groups: no treatment, radiation alone, anti-PD-1 alone, and radiation + anti-PD-1. Survival was followed, and tumor growth was monitored using MRI. Immunohistochemistry, gene expression arrays, and flow cytometry were used to characterize the treatment-induced effects. Pharmacologic inhibitors of T-lymphocytes, bone marrow derived macrophages, and microglia were used to assess the respective roles of different immune populations in observed treatment effects.RESULTS: We found the combined treatment with high dose radiation and immunotherapy to be highly effective with a 75% complete pathologic response and dramatically improved survival outcomes. We found both CD8+ T-cells and macrophages to be necessary for the full effect of combined therapy, with T lymphocytes appearing to play a role early on and macrophages mediating a later phase of the combined treatment effect. Radiation treatment appeared to trigger macrophage repolarization, increasing M1/M2 ratio.CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to a novel immunologic mechanism underlying the interaction between radiotherapy and immunotherapy.

To understand the neural mechanisms underlying these physiological and psychological changes, it is critical to investigate the effects of microgravity on the functional architecture of the brain. In this study, we used resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to study whether the functional architecture of the brain is altered after 45 days of -6degree head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest, which is a reliable model for the simulation of microgravity. Sixteen healthy male volunteers underwent rs-fMRI scans before and after 45 days of -6degree HDT bed rest. Specifically, we used a commonly employed graph-based measure of network organization, i.e., degree centrality (DC), to perform a full-brain exploration of the regions that were influenced by simulated microgravity. We subsequently examined the functional connectivities of these regions using a seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis. We found decreased DC in two regions, the left anterior insula (aINS) and the anterior part of the middle cingulate cortex (MCC; also called the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in many studies), in the male volunteers after 45 days of -6degree HDT bed rest. Furthermore, seed-based RSFC analyses revealed that a functional network anchored in the aINS and MCC was particularly influenced by simulated microgravity. These results provide evidence that simulated microgravity alters the resting-state functional architecture of the brains of males and suggest that the processing of salience information, which is primarily subserved by the aINS-MCC functional network, is particularly influenced by spaceflight. The current findings provide a new perspective for understanding the relationships between microgravity, cognitive function, autonomic neural function, and central neural activity. © 2014 Zhou, Wang, Rao, Liang, Chen, Zheng, Tan, Tian, Wang, Bai, Chen and Li.",Excluded
4743,"High-level production of alpha-particle-emitting (211)At and preparation of (211)At-labeled antibodies for clinical use UNLABELLED: In vitro and in vivo studies in human glioma models suggest that the antitenascin monoclonal antibody 81C6 labeled with the 7.2-h-half-life alpha-particle emitter (211)At might be a valuable endoradiotherapeutic agent for the treatment of brain tumors. The purpose of this study was to develop methods for the production of high levels of (211)At and the radiosynthesis of clinically useful amounts of (211)At-labeled human/mouse chimeric 81C6 antibody.METHODS: (211)At was produced through the (209)Bi(alpha, 2n)(211)At reaction using an internal target system and purified by a dry distillation process. Antibody labeling was accomplished by first synthesizing N-succinimidyl 3-[(211)At]astatobenzoate from the corresponding tri-n-butyl tin precursor and reacting it with the antibody in pH 8.5 borate buffer. Quality control procedures consisted of methanol precipitation, size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and pyrogen and sterility assays, as well as determination of the immunoreactive fraction by a rapid procedure using a recombinant tenascin fragment coupled to magnetic beads.RESULTS: A total of 16 antibody labeling runs were performed. Using beam currents of 50-60 microA alpha-particles and irradiation times of 1.5-4.5 h, the mean (211)At production yield was 27.75 +/- 2.59 MBq/microA.h, and the maximum level of (211)At produced was 6.59 GBq after a 4-h irradiation at 55 microA. The decay-corrected distillation yield was 67% +/- 16%. The yield for the coupling of the (211)At-labeled active ester to the antibody was 76% +/- 8%. The fraction of (211)At activity that eluted with a retention time corresponding to intact IgG on HPLC was 96.0% +/- 2.5%. All preparations had a pyrogen level of <0.125 EU/mL and were determined to be sterile. The mean immunoreactive fraction for these 16 preparations was 83.3% +/- 5.3%. Radiolysis did not interfere with labeling chemistry or the quality of the labeled antibody product.CONCLUSION: These results show that it is feasible to produce clinically relevant activities of (211)At-labeled antibodies and have permitted the initiation of a phase I trial of (211)At-labeled chimeric 81C6 administered directly into the tumor resection cavities of brain tumor patients.",Excluded
4489,"Effect of Fiberoptic Collimation Technique on 808 nm Wavelength Laser Stimulation of Cochlear Neurons OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of fiberoptic collimation technique on auditory neural stimulation in the cochlea with 808 nm wavelength lasers.BACKGROUND DATA: Recently, the pulsed near-infrared lasers in the 800-1000 nm wavelength range have been investigated as an emerging technique to trigger auditory neural response in the cochlea. A laser beam divergence in the optical stimulation pathway exists, which may affect stimulation efficiency and spatial selectivity.METHODS: The fiberoptic collimation technique was proposed for cochlear neuron stimulation, and the C-lens element was designed as the collimation structure. The spiral ganglion cells in deafened guinea pigs' cochlea were irradiated with collimated and uncollimated near-infrared lasers. Optically evoked auditory brainstem response (OABR) under the two laser output modes were recorded.RESULTS: Laser with the collimation technique evoked an average 58% higher OABR amplitude than the uncollimated laser output. In addition, the collimated laser setup consumed on average 35.2% of laser energy compared with the uncollimated laser when evoking the same OABR amplitude.CONCLUSIONS: The fiberoptic collimation technique improved stimulation efficiency and reduced stimulating energy consumption in near-infrared neural stimulation in cochlea. The positive effects of laser collimation technique could benefit further research in optically based cochlear implants.",Excluded

3881,"Plaque Neovascularization Is Increased in Human Carotid Atherosclerosis Related to Prior Neck Radiotherapy: A Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Study OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of radiotherapy (RT) on intraplaque neovascularization (IPN) in human carotid arteries.BACKGROUND: Exposure of the carotid arteries to RT during treatment for head and neck cancer is associated with increased risk for stroke. However, the effect of RT on IPN, a precursor to intraplaque hemorrhage and thus associated with plaque vulnerability, is unknown.METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patients who had undergone unilateral RT for head and neck cancer >=2 years previously underwent B-mode and contrast-enhanced ultrasound of both RT-side and non-RT-side carotid arteries. Presence of IPN during contrast-enhanced ultrasound was judged semiquantitatively as grade 0 (absent), grade 1 (present but limited to plaque base), or grade 2 (extensive and noted within plaque body).RESULTS: Of 49 patients studied, 38 (78%) had plaques. The number of plaques was significantly greater in the RT than the non-RT arteries. Overall, 48 of 64 RT-side plaques (75%) had IPN compared with 9 of 23 non-RT-side (39%) plaques (p = 0.002). Among patients with plaques, IPN was present in 81% of patients with RT-side plaques and 41% of patients with non-RT-side plaques (p = 0.004). Grade 0 IPN was significantly more common in patients with non-RT-side plaques (25% vs. 61%; p = 0.002), whereas grade 2 plaques were more common on the RT side (31% vs. 9%; p = 0.03). The only clinical variable that predicted the presence or absence of IPN was RT laterality.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in humans to reveal a significant association between RT and the presence and extent of IPN. This may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the increased stroke risk among survivors of head and neck cancer treated by RT.",Excluded
4377,"[The stimulating impact of light on brain cognition function] Light regulates multiple non-visual circadian, neuroendocrine, and neurobehavioral functions, and conveys a strong stimulating signal for alert-ness and cognition. This review summarizes a series of neuroimaging studies investigating the brain mechanisms underlying the latter stimulating impact of light. Results of these studies are compatible with a scenario where light would first hit subcortical areas involved in arousal regulation before affecting cortical areas involved in the ongoing non-visual cognitive process, and then cognitive performance. Recent data demonstrated that the non-visual impact of light is most likely triggered via outputs from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which are maximally sensitive to blue light. In addition, the stimulating impact of light is intimately related to wakefulness regulation as it changes with circadian phase and sleep pressure. Finally, markers of inter-individual difference have also been described: age, PERIOD3 genotype, and psychiatric status. This review emphasizes the importance of light for human brain cognitive function and for cognition in general.",Excluded
3844,"Principles of diagnostic sonography in iliopsoas tendon pathology: A case report This article describes the diagnostic value of musculoskeletal sonography in the management of tendon pathology and outlines a clinical example of its scope of utilization. Herein we describe the case of a 65-year-old man who sought rehabilitation services for left groin pain following a period of intense trekking and uphill walking. He presented with left hip flexor weakness and local tenderness over the left iliopsoas tendon with negative findings on neurological evaluation. Additionally, he presented with left hip capsule and hip flexor tightness with left gluteus maximus and gluteus medius weakness. The left hip capsule tightness was predominantly in the posterior fibres, with restriction of hip internal rotation. The clinical picture overall was suggestive of the presence of risk parameters for iliopsoas tendinopathy. Plain radiographs of the hip revealed mild degenerative changes with a mild pincer impingement. While his clinical and radiological picture was suggestive of degenerative and soft tissue pathology of the hip, a real-time sonographic study was useful in the quantitative confirmation of a partial tear of the left iliopsoas tendon. Additionally, a repeat sonographic study performed four weeks later, revealed a healing iliopsoas tendon seen as a decrease in the width of the hypoechoic presentation of the tear. To summarize, the value of musculoskeletal sonography as a diagnostic tool as well as the assessment of the progression of tendon healing is discussed. Sonography is safe, noninvasive, and does not use ionizing radiation. It is steadily gaining popularity in the diagnosis of tendon lesions.",Excluded

Each of the forms of motor deprivation hindered the elaboration of DR; gamma-irradiation aggravated these disorders. At the same time, AOH led to significantly more severe disturbances in the higher nervous activity including the generalized excitation, pathologic aggressiveness and neurotization of animals. In contrast, hypokinesia stimulated the active elements of behavior which inhibit the passive-defensive behavior and a fear reaction. Therefore, the modifying effect of irradiation becomes apparent only if combined with AOH.",Included

Taken 3D-DSA as the gold standards, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of the Flash scanning model CTA in diagnosis of cerebrovascular lesions were calculated. The differences between 3D-DSA and Flash scanning model CTA in diagnosis of cerebrovascular lesions were compared. Flash CTA radiation dose and contrast agent dosage were calculated. Results Among 105 patients, dual-source Flash scanning model CTA diagnosed 73 aneurysms in 60 cases, including 24 micro aneurysms, as well as 13 cases of arteriovenous malformation (AVM), 5 cases of internal carotid cavernous sinus leakage, 2 cases of venous malformation, 9 cases of arterial stenosis and 6 cases of moyamoya disease, while misdiagnosed 2 cases of micro aneurysms and missed 1 case of AVM located in distal area of middle cerebral artery.

4774,"Penguin Suit and Fetal Position Finite Element Model to Prevent Low Back Pain in Spaceflight <b>BACKGROUND:</b> This study aimed to investigate the biomechanical effects of different interventions on astronauts lumbar intervertebral discs in a microgravity environment during spaceflight and in a gravity environment when the astronaut returns. <b>METHODS:</b> A finite element model of the L4L5 lumbar segment was developed with eight loading schemes representing different interventions. The loading schemes included no intervention, wearing a penguin suit, sleeping in a fetal position, wearing a penguin suit combined with sleeping in the fetal position, reclining for 4 or 16 h/d, and maintaining upright posture for 4 or 16 h/d. <b>RESULTS:</b> Without intervention, the microgravity environment led to increased central pore pressure, radial displacement, and water content in the lumbar intervertebral disc. Wearing a penguin suit combined with sleeping in the fetal position can reduce disc pore pressure, axial stress, radial displacement, and water content to 0.156 MPa, 11.50 kPa, 0.538 mm, and 1.390%, respectively. When astronauts return to the gravity environment, staying upright for 4 h can reduce the pore pressure, axial stress, radial displacement, and water content of the intervertebral disc to 0.222 MPa, 10.72 kPa, 0.373 mm, and 0.219%, respectively. <b>CONCLUSION:</b> This study showed that wearing a penguin suit and sleeping in the fetal position both have the potential to protect the lumbar intervertebral disc from the negative effects caused by microgravity. Remaining in the upright posture for 4 h per day may help squeeze out the water in the intervertebral disc safely when astronauts return to the gravity environment. <b>Zhang S, Wang K, Zhu R, Jiang C, Niu W.

4440,"Increased expression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein in limbic brain regions after amygdala-kindled seizures in rats Increased expression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp; ABCB1) has previously been found in epileptogenic brain tissue from patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) as well as in the hippocampus and other limbic brain regions in the rat kainate model of TLE. Approaches to the quantification of Pgp expression have mainly been based on subjective visual estimation of the level of Pgp immunoreactivity in brain sections. In the present study, computer-assisted image analysis based on optical density (OD) measurements was used to examine immunohistochemical expression of Pgp in the kindling model of TLE. Sections from kainate-treated rats were used for comparison. Using diaminobenzidine as chromogen, Pgp was exclusively located in brain capillary endothelial cells, which was confirmed by double-labeling with an antibody against the endothelial glucose transporter (GLUT-1). After kainate-induced seizures, the intensity of endothelial Pgp staining significantly increased by 70-80% in the dentate gyrus. A significant, albeit less marked increase in Pgp expression in this area was also seen after amygdala-kindled seizures. Furthermore, Pgp was upregulated after kindling in the hilus of the dentate gyrus, the CA1 and CA3 sectors of the hippocampus, and the piriform and cerebral cortex. In kindled rats, most Pgp alterations occurred ipsilateral to the electrode in the basolateral amygdala. The data demonstrate that computer-assisted image analysis using OD is an accurate and rapid method to determine the relative amount of Pgp protein in brain sections and the effects of seizures on this multidrug transporter. The fact that Pgp overexpression in brain capillary endothelial cells occurs in two established models of difficult-to-treat TLE substantiates the notion that seizure-induced upregulation of Pgp contributes to multidrug resistance (MDR) in epilepsy.",Excluded

The re-irradiation followed surgery in all but two cases. The median time to recurrence was 9 years (range 2-17) and median follow-up after the second course of radiotherapy was 10 years (range 1-30). The median initial radiation dose was 4084 cGy; that at recurrence was 4200 cGy. Local control has been maintained in 12 patients. One failed locally with a benign adenoma that was surgically salvaged. Two developed pituitary carcinomas which were poorly controlled. Of the patients who presented with visual abnormalities at the time of recurrence, 50% improved and the remainder stabilized after re-irradiation. There are no long-term visual complications. Hypopituitarism was present in nine patients prior to the second course of radiotherapy and developed in the remaining six patients after re-irradiation. Temporal lobe injury was seen in two patients. Careful analysis of each patient's pituitary and temporal lobe doses, intervals between treatments, treatment volume, neurets, relative decay factors, absolute decay factors, TDF and modified LQF values, and dose-volume relationships, revealed no correlation with complication or likelihood of local control.

3632,"Associations among magnetic resonance spectroscopy, apparent diffusion coefficients, and image-guided histopathology with special attention to radiation necrosis OBJECTIVE: In patients with malignant glioma previously treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, clinical and radiographic signs of recurrent disease often require differentiation between radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor. Published work suggests that although magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can reliably differentiate pure tumor, pure necrosis, and spectroscopically normal tissues, it may not be particularly helpful because most patients have mixed histological findings comprised of necrosis and tumor. To improve our clinical ability to discriminate among these histological entities, we have analyzed MRS in conjunction with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences derived from magnetic resonance imaging.METHODS: In 18 patients, spectroscopic and diffusion-weighted images were obtained before surgery for suspected recurrent neoplastic disease. Spectral data for pure tumor, pure necrosis, and mixed tumor and necrosis were derived from 65 spectroscopic observations in patients with previously treated gliomas (n = 16) and metastatic tumors (n = 2). Spectral data for choline (Cho), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), and lipid-lactate were analyzed separately and in conjunction with ADCs in all patients (15 observations of pure tumor, 33 observations of pure necrosis, and 13 observations of mixed tumor and necrosis). Histological specimens were obtained stereotactically at the time of surgery (<48 h after image acquisition) for recurrent disease and digitally co-registered with MRS data.RESULTS: ADC values for pure tumor, pure necrosis, and mixed tumor and necrosis were 1.30, 1.60, and 1.42, respectively. Cho/NAA less than 0.20, NAA/normal Cr greater than 1.56, and NAA/Cho greater than 1.32 increase the odds that a tissue biopsy will be pure necrosis versus mixed tumor and necrosis. Although various values of all MRS ratios analyzed may provide positive correlations for histopathological differentiation of tissue between that of pure tumor and that of pure necrosis, the addition of ADC values to only NAA/Cho and NAA/normal Cr increases the odds of correct differentiation between pure tumor and pure necrosis. The addition of ADC values does not provide additional information beyond that of MRS in distinguishing specimens of mixed tumor and necrosis from either pure tumor or pure necrosis.CONCLUSION: It has been demonstrated that MRS ratio analysis may allow for the clinical discrimination between specimens of pure tumor and pure necrosis, and the addition of ADC data into this analysis may enhance this specific differentiation. However, although a trend toward correlation between ADC values and the various histopathological features was noted, the direct addition of ADC data does not seem to allow further discrimination, beyond that provided by MRS, among specimens of mixed tumor and necrosis and either pure tumor or pure necrosis.",Excluded

4002,"SRS of brain AVM Brain AVM was one of the first pathologies treated with stereotactic radiosurgery, notably the Gammaknife. Almost all treatment and outcome models are thus derived from the abundance of data from Gammaknife treatment. Due to differences in radiation dose distribution these models may not be fully applicable to treatment with linear accelerator or proton beam generator. The results from SRS of brain AVMare predictable and depend on a few well defined parameters: The chance for obliteration depends on the radiation dose to the periphery of the AVM nidus. Typically a radiation dose of 25Gy will incure an 80% chance for obliteration over a three year period. The risk for adverse radiation effects (oedema, radionecrosis, cysts) depends on the amount of energy deposited into the target and the surrounding brain. Thus the higher the radiation dose and the bigger the target the higher the risk. The risk for hemorrhage during the latency period before occlusion (maximum of three years) depends on the radiation dose to the periphery of the nidus, the nidus volume, previous recent hemorrhage and probably AVM location. Thus the higher the radiation dose and the smaller the target - the lower the risk for hemorrhage. Previous recent hemorrhage and central AVM location increases the risk.",Excluded

The effect of this exposure to alkali on the DNA size distribution was determined by comparing the DNA filter elution profiles obtained experimentally with those theoretically predicted for monodispersed and random distributions. At pH 12.3 or 12.9, DNA from cells irradiated with 300 rad eluted with first-order kinetics corresponding to a random DNA size distribution. The median size of the distribution decreased if the irradiated DNA was exposed to pH 12.3 for 24 h. At pH 12.3 or 12.9, DNA from unirradiated cells eluted initially with complex kinetics that later became linear (18-21 h for pH 12.3 or 13-15 h for pH 12.9), characteristic of a monodispersed DNA size distribution. Holding either unirradiated or irradiated DNA at pH 11.0, below the critical unwinding pH, produced no effect on the elution profiles. Analysis of these filter elution data indicated that after sufficient exposure to pH 12.3 or 12.9, undamaged DNA molecules from mammalian cells elute as a single-stranded monodispersed size distribution of approximately 1 X 10(10) daltons. While the possibility cannot be completely eliminated that this monodispersed size represents an upper limit determined by physical forces, these results, in conjunction with those obtained using other techniques, lend credence to the existence of a nonrandom higher-order structure in mammalian chromosomal DNA.",Excluded

Although recurrent spinal cord compression is a common problem, little is known about whether reirradiation preserves neurologic function and what risk of radiation myelopathy it carries. To investigate this question, we reviewed patients at the Mayo Clinic between 1975 and 1992 undergoing two or more courses of radiotherapy to the same segment of the spinal column with radiographically documented epidural disease at the time of reirradiation to determine outcome as measured by the ability to walk and by survival. Fifty- four patients met the study criteria. Radiation doses for the first course ranged from 2,250 to 5,400 cGy (median, 3,000 cGy), and total dose for all courses to the reirradiated spinal segment ranged from 3,650 to 8,089 cGy (median, 5,425 cGy). All patients were ambulatory following the first course of radiation, 40 (74%) were ambulatory at the onset of reirradiation, and 42 (78%) were ambulatory at the end of reirradiation. Thirty-seven patients (69%) remained ambulatory at their last follow-up 6 days to 80 months following reirradiation (median, 4.7 months). Five patients eventually became nonambulatory 6.5 to 35 months following reirradiation. Median survival for all patients following reirradiation was 4.2 months.

We determined the effects of a 6 Gy irradiation given focally on osteolytic sarcoma cells inoculated in humeri of mice. Pain behavior was assessed using the rota-rod and the grip force test. Seven days post-irradiation (day 17 post-tumor implantation) the performance of mice markedly improved on the rotarod (non-irradiated, 67+/-16s vs irradiated, 223 +/- 22 s; P = 0.0005), and the grip force test (non-irradiated, 34 +/- 4 g vs irradiated, 55 +/- 2 g; P = 0.001). This improvement was similar to the analgesia achieved with 30 mg/kg of the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ketorolac (Rota-rod, 67 +/- 16 s vs 178 +/- 35 s; P = 0.01: grip force test, 34 +/- 4 g, vs 60 +/- 5 g; P = 0.003). Following irradiation, the tumor mass and the number of osteoclasts did not decrease while the expression of two pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) increased. Tumor irradiation led to clear differences in the spinal cord. These include a decrease in glial activity (astrocytes and microglial cells) as well as pain mediators such as dynorphin, COX-2 and chemotactic cytokine receptor (CCR2). We conclude that the analgesic effect of low dose irradiation of bone cancer is associated with the alteration of nociceptive transmission in the central nervous system.",Excluded
3864,"Resveratrol restores erectile function in irradiated rats: Role on SIRT-1 and nNOS protein expressions INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of resveratrol (RVT), a well-known antioxidant agent, on oxidative parameters and erectile function in a rat model of pelvic irradiation. MATERIAL & METHODS: Fifty Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups; control (C), radiation-early period (1 week) (Rd-E), radiation-late period (10 weeks) (Rd-L), Rd-E and resveratrol (Rd-E-RVT) and Rd-L and resveratrol treatment (Rd-L-RVT). Irradiation was performed based on the localized prostate cancer treatment protocol as a total of 20Gy. Resveratrol was given 10mg/kg orally 1 week for Rd-E-RVT group and 10 weeks for Rd-L-RVT. At the end of the experiment, intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements were performed and rats were sacrificed for tissue collection. RESULT(S): Malondealdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and caspase-3 activities were increased in both early and late irradiation groups as the latter being more elevated. Resveratrol treatment reversed these parameters back to control levels in both Rd- E-RVT and Rd-L-RVT groups. Glutathione (GSH) levels were decreased in Rd-E and Rd-L groups and were reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment in both early and late periods. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activities, cyclic GMP (c-GMP) and nitric oxide (NO) levels were decreased in the early period of irradiation however this difference doesn't have statistical significance. These parameters were decreased significantly in Rd-L group and resveratrol treatment reversed these values back to control levels. Sirtuin-1 protein expression was similar in both Rd-E and Rd-E-RVT groups however the protein expression was decreased in the late radiation period which is reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment. Intracavernosal pressure measurements were performed only in the late period as erectile dysfunction is a late complication of irradiation. The ICP/MAP ratio was significantly decreased in Rd-L group and was significantly reversed back to control levels with RvT treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Resveratrol, due to its strong anti-oxidant effects, may be a potential candidate for the management of oxidative stress induced erectile dysfunction in patients undergoing pelvic irradiation, if supported with further clinical studies.

4754,"Aggressive and malignant prolactin pituitary tumors: pathological diagnosis and patient management According to the World Health Organization classification of pituitary tumors, only tumors with systemic metastasis must be considered as carcinomas. Invasive tumors with multiple recurrences are only classified as aggressive tumors or ""atypical adenomas"". To illustrate the problems encountered in the pathological diagnosis of pituitary carcinoma and in patient management, we present two male patients operated on for an aggressive prolactin pituitary adenoma with and without metastasis. In case 1, 5 surgeries, 3 irradiations, increased doses of dopamine agonists, and trials of temozolomide and carboplatine-VP16 failed to control tumor progression and the appearance of metastases which lead to death 16 years after onset. In case 2, based on the initial diagnosis of an aggressive-invasive adenoma that was resistant to dopamine agonists, gamma-Knife irradiation was initially performed on the intra-cavernous remnant. Eight years after onset, the remnant remained stabilized and the plasma PRL normalized under dopamine agonist. From these 2 cases alongside other cases found in the literature, we propose that the association of certain clinical signs (male sex, dopamine-resistant hyperprolactinemia), radiological signs (invasive macro or giant tumor on MRI) and histological signs (angiogenesis, Ki-67 > 3%, p53 positive, mitoses >2 per high power field, vascular invasion, up-regulation of genes related to invasion and proliferation, and allelic loss of chromosome 11) might suggest aggressiveness and be suspicious of malignancy before the appearance of metastasis. The early detection of an aggressive phenotype of a prolactin pituitary tumor should permit the earlier establishment of the optimum therapeutic strategy associating surgery and radiotherapy to delay or inhibit metastasis.",Excluded
4640,"Impact of dose boost in skull base on recurrence of stage T4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma. [Chinese] BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The recurrence rate in skull base is high for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement. This study was conducted to explore the impact of dose boost in skull base on the recurrence in skull base and survival of NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement. METHOD(S): A total of 120 stage T4 NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement proved by histopathology and computed tomography (CT) were treated in our hospital from Oct. 1996 to Nov. 1998. The irradiation dose was (71.55+/-3.09) Gy in nasopharynx and (58.95+/-6.16) Gy in neck. Of the 120 patients, 27 received irradiation (6-10 Gy) in skull base after radiotherapy (boost group), 93 did not receive irradiation in skull base (control group). Fifty-three patients, 41 in control group and 12 in boost group, received cisplatin-based chemotherapy for 1-3 cycles. The survival rates and the recurrence of the 2 groups were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. RESULT(S): The clinical characteristics of patients were similar in the 2 groups. The 1-, 3-, 5-year skull base control rates were significantly higher in boost group than in control group (100% vs. 93.4%, 91.8% vs. 76.4%, and 86.8% vs. 65.1%, respectively, P=0.045). The 1-, 3-, 5-year disease-freely survival rates were slightly higher in boost group than in control group (85.2% vs. 75.3%, 59.3% vs. 45.2%, and 51.9% vs. 31.2%, respectively, P=0.084). The median disease-freely survival time was longer in boost group than in control group (60 months vs. 30 months). The prevalences of irradiation-induced brain damage were 7.4% in boost group and 4.3% in control group with no significant difference (P=0.514). CONCLUSION(S): Dose boost in skull base can reduce the recurrence of stage T4 NPC in skull base and tends to enhance the disease-freely survival rate for NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvementu it is recommended to such patients.",Excluded
4636,"Technical and dosimetric considerations in multi-isocenter intensity modulated radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma with small multileaf collimator Multileaf collimator (MLC)-assisted intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has greatly improved the target coverage and avoidance of organs at risk (OAR) for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma; however, its implementation is also constrained by the features of the MLC. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma tends to have a large gross target volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV) due to its biological characteristics. More than one isocenter may be needed when small MLCs (i.e., BrainLAB M3, whose largest field is 10 x 10 cm(2)) are used to treat the nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The BrainLAB IMRT system was used to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-isocenter IMRT plan for treating nasopharyngeal cancers. Dose coverage of GTVs and CTVs were compared among IMRT plans with 1, 2 and 3 isocenters, as were dose objectives for OARs including brainstem, cord, and parotids. The dosimetric variation and the delivery time were also measured with a phantom. IMRT plans with more than 1 isocenter achieved a better dose coverage, homogeneity, and conformity on GTVs and CTVs; however, with risk of higher doses given to OARs. In most cases, one can generate satisfactory IMRT plans using the 2-isocenter IMRT planning strategy. Two-isocenter planning strategy may be a suitable compromise when more isocenters are needed.",Excluded

[Japanese] Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients with small cell lung cancer has been performed in many countries. While a consensus that PCI decreased the rate of tumor recurrence in the brain has been obtained, the survival advantage of PCI remains controversial. To improve results of PCI, a retrospective study was carried out. Twenty-five patients and 16 patients underwent PCI with doses of 24 Gy (accelerated hyperfractionation) and 30 Gy. Overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 60% and 26% for the patients with a dose of 24 Gy, and 33% and 20% for those with a dose of 30 Gy, respectively. Brain metastasis as the first relapse site was 16% and 13% for the patients with doses of 24 Gy and 30 Gy, and brain metastasis as the only relapse site was 12% and 6%, respectively. As prognostic factors, there were significant differences between patients with less than 65 years of age and 65 or more, and between patients with stage IIIa and stage IIIB. A prospective randomized study with more strict patient selection (stage III A disease) and appropriate dose (27-30Gy) for PCI may prove that PCI provides significant survival benefit.",Excluded
4008,"The effects of low-level laser irradiation on differentiation and proliferation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells into neurons and osteoblasts-an in vitro study Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are promising for use in regenerative medicine. Several studies have shown that low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) could affect the differentiation and proliferation of MSCs. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of LLLI at different energy densities on BMSCs differentiation into neuron and osteoblast. Human BMSCs were cultured and induced to differentiate to either neuron or osteoblast in the absence or presence of LLLI. Gallium aluminum arsenide (GaAlAs) laser irradiation (810 nm) was applied at days and of differentiation process at energy densities of 3 or 6 J/cm<sup>2</sup> for BMSCs being induced to neurons, and 2 or 4 J/cm<sup>2</sup> for BMSCs being induced to osteoblasts. BMSCs proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay on the seventh day of differentiation. BMSCs differentiation to neurons was assessed by immunocytochemical analysis of neuron-specific enolase on the seventh day of differentiation. BMSCs differentiation to osteoblastwas tested on the second, fifth, seventh and tenth day of differentiation via analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. LLLI promoted BMSCs proliferation significantly at all energy densities except for 6 J/cm<sup>2</sup> in comparison to control groups on the seventh day of differentiation. LLLI at energy densities of 3 and 6 J/cm<sup>2</sup> dramatically facilitated the differentiation of BMSCs into neurons (p<.001). Also, ALP activity was significantly enhanced in irradiated BMSCs differentiated to osteoblast on the second, fifth, seventh, and tenth day of differentiation (p<0.001 except for the second day). Using LLLI at 810 nm wavelength enhances BMSCs differentiation into neuron and osteoblast in the range of 2-6 J/cm <sup>2</sup>, and at the same time increases BMSCs proliferation (except for 6 J/cm<sup>2</sup>). The effect of LLLI on differentiation and proliferation of BMSCs is dose-dependent. Considering these findings, LLLI could improve current in vitro methods of differentiating BMSCs prior to transplantation. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Ltd.",Excluded
3671,"Spinal robotics: current applications and future perspectives Even though robotic technology holds great potential for performing spinal surgery and advancing neurosurgical techniques, it is of utmost importance to establish its practicality and to demonstrate better clinical outcomes compared with traditional techniques, especially in the current cost-effective era.

However, workflow, usability, interdisciplinary setups, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness have to be proven prospectively. This article includes a short description of robotic structures and workflow, followed by preliminary results of a randomized prospective study comparing conventional free-hand techniques with routine spine navigation and robotic-assisted procedures. Additionally, we present cases performed with a spinal robotic device, assessing not only the accuracy of the robotic-assisted procedure but also other factors (eg, minimal invasiveness, radiation dosage, and learning curves). Currently, the use of robotics in spinal surgery greatly enhances the application of minimally invasive procedures by increasing accuracy and reducing radiation exposure for patients and surgeons compared with standard procedures. Second-generation hardware and software upgrades of existing devices will enhance workflow and intraoperative setup.

4359,"Radiation target delineation of micro brain arteriovenous malformations using highresolution flat-detector cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) Purpose Radiation therapy has shown to be an effective treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs).1 2 Target delineation is commonly performed on volumetric image data, such as MRI or CT data. However, the nidi of micro-AVMs may not be visualized adequately by these modalities due to their limited image resolution. In this report, we show a novel usage of high-resolution contrastenhanced cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging and multi-modal image registration<sup>3</sup> for radiation target delineation of a micro-AVM, a technique previously suggested for larger AVMs.4 Case A 42-year-old male presented with intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the mesencephalic tectum and left posterior thalamus. Conventional angiography revealed a left superior collicular AVM with a nidus of 3mm. The AVM was successfully embolized but follow-up angiography examinations at 36 months demonstrated a small re-growth of the AVM (Abstract P-017 figure 1A). The patient was thus referred to radiosurgery. Thin slice contrast and non-contrast MRI acquired for target delineation did not show the AVM nidus. Therefore, the patient was transferred to the angiography suite for high resolution contrast-enhanced CBCT. Data was acquired using the angiography c-arm system with a reduced detector size of 22 cm. Contrast was injected with 2 ml/s for a total of 64 ml and a 2 sec delay) using a coupled power injector into the left vertebral artery with a 5Fr catheter. Volumetric CBCT data (FOV: 70<sup>3</sup>mm<sup>3</sup>, matrix: 0.14<sup>3</sup>mm<sup>3</sup>) was generated using a nonbinned reconstruction algorithm. Lesion and nidus were visualized with CBCT. MRI, CT-simulator and CBCT data was then transferred to the radiation planning software and mutually co-registered. The nidus was delineated on CBCT data by an experienced neurointerventional radiologist for radiation therapy and dose/ treatment plan was completed. Due to image registration, the target area could be directly transferred to MRI and CT data (Abstract P-0017 figure 1B). The patient received a total of 4 radiation sessions. Discussion and Conclusion Radiation target delineation of micro AVMs can be challenging with conventional 3D imaging techniques as their spatial resolution is relatively low for the application of visualization of the nidus. We were able to demonstrate the complementary value of high resolution contrast enhanced CBCT in radiation target delineation of a micro brain AVM. Multi-modal image registration of CBCTwith MRI and CT-simulator has shown to be an effective method for radiation target delineation. (Figure presented).",Excluded
4674,"Distinguishing glioma recurrence from treatment effect after radiochemotherapy and immunotherapy Recent advancements have made radiation and chemotherapy the standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastomas. The use of these therapies has resulted in an increased diagnosis of pseudoprogression and radiation-induced necrosis. Standard MRI techniques are inadequate in differentiating tumor recurrence from posttreatment effects. Diagnosis of a posttreatment lesion as glioma recurrence rather than radiochemotherapy or immunotherapy treatment effect is critical. This increase in accuracy plays a role as newer immunotherapies incurring posttreatment effects on MRI emerge. Advancements with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging, and functional positron emission tomography scans have shown promising capabilities. Further investigations are necessary to assess the imaging algorithms and accuracy of these modalities to differentiate true glioma recurrence from radiotherapy or immunotherapy treatment effect.

4747,"Flat panel CT following stapes prosthesis insertion: an experimental and clinical study OBJECTIVES: Anatomical information of the middle and inner ear is becoming increasingly important in post-operative evaluation especially after stapesplasty with unsuccessful improvement of the air-bone gap (ABG). So far computed tomography (CT) has been the first choice for detection of reasons for recurrent hearing loss. CT has the disadvantage of metal-induced artefacts after insertion of middle ear implants and of a relatively high irradiation dose.METHODS: Flat panel CT (fpCT) was performed in three temporal bone specimen after experimental insertion of different stapes prostheses, aiming to validate the accuracy of fpCT of the middle and inner ear. Additionally, 28 consecutive patients, supplied with different stapes prostheses underwent post-operative fpCT to compare the pre- and post-operative hearing results with the determined prosthesis position in the middle and inner ear.RESULTS: In all cases, fpCT showed a statistically significant correlation between hearing improvement and prosthesis position. This technique provided detailed post-operative information of the implant position in patients and temporal bone specimen.CONCLUSIONS: The new imaging technique of fpCT allows the immediate and almost artefact-free evaluation of surgical results following stapesplasty. Further benefits are a lower irradiation dose and higher isovolumetric resolution compared with standard CT.KEY POINTS: Flat panel computed tomography (fpCT) helps otosurgeons design precise stapes protheses. fpCT allows a prediction of the postoperative hearing outcome in patients. fpCT is an adequate imaging technique for immediate postoperative quality control.

4739,"Magnetic resonance imaging-guided attenuation and scatter corrections in three-dimensional brain positron emission tomography Reliable attenuation correction represents an essential component of the long chain of modules required for the reconstruction of artifact-free, quantitative brain positron emission tomography (PET) images. In this work we demonstrate the proof of principle of segmented magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided attenuation and scatter corrections in three-dimensional (3D) brain PET. We have developed a method for attenuation correction based on registered T1-weighted MRI, eliminating the need of an additional transmission (TX) scan. The MR images were realigned to preliminary reconstructions of PET data using an automatic algorithm and then segmented by means of a fuzzy clustering technique which identifies tissues of significantly different density and composition. The voxels belonging to different regions were classified into air, skull, brain tissue and nasal sinuses. These voxels were then assigned theoretical tissue-dependent attenuation coefficients as reported in the ICRU 44 report followed by Gaussian smoothing and addition of a good statistics bed image. The MRI-derived attenuation map was then forward projected to generate attenuation correction factors (ACFs) to be used for correcting the emission (EM) data. The method was evaluated and validated on 10 patient data where TX and MRI brain images were available. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of differences between TX-guided and segmented MRI-guided 3D reconstructions were performed by visual assessment and by estimating parameters of clinical interest. The results indicated a small but noticeable improvement in image quality as a consequence of the reduction of noise propagation from TX into EM data. Considering the difficulties associated with preinjection TX-based attenuation correction and the limitations of current calculated attenuation correction, MRI-based attenuation correction in 3D brain PET would likely be the method of choice for the foreseeable future as a second best approach in a busy nuclear medicine center and could be applied to other functional brain imaging modalities such as SPECT.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to quantify late effects in renal cortex of nude mice exposed to high amounts of [(177)Lu]-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate ([(177)Lu]-DOTATATE), and to determine whether a threshold dose value exists for these findings.METHODS: Nude mice were exposed to 90, 120 or 150 MBq of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE. Renal toxicity was evaluated up to 6 months after injection. Blood samples were collected to examine renal functional markers, and after sacrifice at 6 months changes in renal morphology were explored. Tissue damage was estimated by quantifying the relative area of the different subunits in the renal cortex using point counting. Additional morphological signs of radiation damage were also noted. The absorbed doses to the kidneys were estimated by previously determined kidney pharmacokinetics and Monte Carlo simulations for different assumptions regarding the activity distribution.RESULTS: Increased serum creatinine and urea values indicated long-term renal toxicity. The tissue area occupied by proximal tubules decreased with increasing doses of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE, whereas the other subunits in cortex slightly increased. The mean absorbed dose in the renal cortex for [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE was estimated to be 35-58 Gy for the different groups of animals. A dose-response relationship was observed for proximal tubular damage, and a threshold dose value of 24 Gy (BED 37 Gy) was determined.CONCLUSIONS: Selective morphological changes in kidney cortex of nude mice were quantified and appeared in a dose dependent manner after injection of high amounts of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE.",Included
4111,"Subthalamic nucleus stimulation for primary dystonia and tardive dystonia With the renaissance of stereotactic pallidotomy for Parkinson's disease in 1990s, pallidotomy has become increasingly used as an effective treatment for various manifestations of medically refractory dystonia. More recently, deep brain stimulation of globus pallidus internus (GPi) has been replacing pallidotomy. Although GPi DBS has great promise for treating dystonia, there are some disadvantages. We introduce our experiences in subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS for primary dystonia and tardive dystonia in this chapter. We propose that STN DBS has the following advantages over GPi DBS: (1) symptomatic improvement is seen immediately after stimulation, allowing us to quickly select the most suitable stimulation parameters; (2) the stimulation parameters for the STN are lower than those used for the GPi, resulting in longer battery life; and (3) STN DBS results in better symptomatic control than GPi DBS in dystonia patients when our STN data is compared to that obtained by others with using the GPi as the target. We suggest that STN DBS may be the most appropriate surgical technique for dystonia. [References: 50]",Excluded
4619,"Quantifying and improving the efficiency of Gamma Knife treatment plans for brain metastases: results of a 1-year audit OBJECT: A method for quantifying the efficiency of Gamma Knife treatment plans for metastases was previously implemented by the authors to retrospectively identify the least efficient plans and has provided insights into improved planning strategies. The aim of the current work was to ascertain whether those insights led to improved treatment plans.METHODS: Following completion of the initial study, a 1-year audit of metastasis plans created at St. James's Institute of Oncology was carried out. Audited recent plans were compared with the earlier plans of the initial study, in terms of their efficiency and dosimetric quality. The statistical significance of any differences between relevant plan parameters was quantified by Mann-Whitney U-tests. Comparisons were made between all plans and repeated for a reduced set of plans from which the smallest lesions treated with a single 4-mm shot were excluded. The plan parameters compared were a plan efficiency index (PEI), the number of shots, Paddick conformity index (PCI), gradient index (GI), and percent coverage (of the lesion by the prescription isodose).RESULTS: A total of 157 metastatic lesions were included in the audit and were compared with 241 in the initial study. In a comparison of all cases, the audited plans achieved a higher median PEI score than did the earlier plans from the initial study (1.08 vs 1.02), indicating improved efficiency of the audited plans. When the smallest lesions (for which there was little scope for varying plan strategy) were discounted, the improvement in median PEI score was greater (1.23 vs 1.03, p < 0.001). This improvement in efficiency corresponds to an estimated mean (maximum) time saving of 15% (66%) per lesion (11 minutes [64 minutes] on the day of treatment). The modified planning strategy yielding these efficiency improvements did not rely on the use of significantly fewer shots (median 11 vs 11 shots, p = 0.924), nor did it result in significant detriment to dosimetric quality (median coverage 99% vs 99%, median PCI 0.84 vs 0.83, p = 0.449, and median GI 2.72 vs 2.67, p = 0.701, audited plans vs initial plans, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Choice of planning strategy can substantially affect plan efficiency and thus strongly influence treatment time. Through increased emphasis on efficiency, resulting from the introduction of PEI combined with a modified planning strategy informed by previous work, it has been possible to reduce times for metastatic plans without compromising their dosimetric quality. Although the average time savings achieved per lesion are moderate, the potential benefits per patient are greater for those with multiple metastases. Reducing treatment times has clear benefits with regard to patient comfort and throughput. In addition, optimization of plan efficiency may potentially affect the biologically effective dose from Gamma Knife treatments and offers opportunity for further work.",Excluded

However, the functional significance of these polymorphic variants in altering cell processes such as cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, and apoptosis is uncertain. We have cloned the XPD variants Lys751Gln, Asp312Asn, and Lys751Gln-Asp312Asn into a pcDNA-3.1-expression vector. Using these constructs, we did not find any detectable difference in either in vitro binding with wild-type p53 or in DNA repair proficiency as measured by host cell reactivation assay. We then genotyped 34 different lymphoblastoid cell lines from six Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humaine (CEPH)/Utah pedigree families and a CEPH/French pedigree family for polymorphisms at codons 751 and 312 and assessed their apoptotic response after either UV or ionized radiation exposure. The lymphoblastoid cell lines with homozygous or heterozygous Asp at codon 312 have similar apoptotic rates, whereas cell lines with homozygous Asn at codon 312 showed a 2.5-fold increased response to UV (P = 0.005; Student's t test). This is the first report known to us of a functional polymorphism in a gene involved in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. However, the presence of Lys or Gln at codon 751 did not influence the apoptotic response to UV. The diminished apoptotic response of cells containing the 312 Asp allele could both allow the survival and selective clonal expansion of carcinogen-damaged cells and be a mechanistic explanation for the increased risk of cancer at diverse tissue sites.",Excluded

Current guidelines recommend 5-hydroxytryptamine<inf>3</inf> receptor antagonists (5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs) for prophylaxis of RINV for moderate and highly emetogenic radiotherapy; however, certain patients may suffer from RINV despite prophylaxis. Objective(s): To determine if switching 5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs is successful in the treatment and further prophylaxis of RINV. Method(s): This report details the case of a 47-year-old female with extensive bony involvement to the spine from breast cancer presenting with lower back pain. To palliate her symptoms, the patient underwent a course of irradiation to the lumbar spine and was prescribed ondansetron as an antiemetic. However, the patient experienced severe nausea and emesis and was subsequently switched to granisetron and aprepitant. Result(s): The patient completed the remainder of the radiation treatment with no further emesis and minimal nausea, representing the first documented success of granisetron and aprepitant for RINV after failure on ondansetron. Conclusion(s): In chemotherapy, switching 5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs after failure on the first is successful in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), yet this has not been previously observed in radiation. In this patient, granisetron and aprepitant were successful in substantially reducing nausea and preventing further emesis, and may represent an alternative antiemetic regimen for RINV prophylaxis and salvage.

4234,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta inhibitors protect hippocampal neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis by regulating MDM2-p53 pathway Exposure of the brain to ionizing radiation can cause neurocognitive deficiencies. The pathophysiology of these neurological changes is complex and includes radiation-induced apoptosis in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. We have recently found that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) resulted in significant protection from radiation-induced apoptosis in hippocampal neurons. The molecular mechanisms of this cytoprotection include abrogation of radiation-induced accumulation of p53. Here we show that pretreatment of irradiated HT-22 hippocampal-derived neurons with small molecule inhibitors of GSK-3beta SB216763 or SB415286, or with GSK-3beta-specific shRNA resulted in accumulation of the p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Knockdown of MDM2 using specific shRNA or chemical inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction prevented the protective changes triggered by GSK-3beta inhibition in irradiated HT-22 neurons and restored radiation cytotoxicity. We found that this could be due to regulation of apoptosis by subcellular localization and interaction of GSK-3beta, p53 and MDM2. These data suggest that the mechanisms of radioprotection by GSK-3beta inhibitors in hippocampal neurons involve regulation of MDM2-dependent p53 accumulation and interactions between GSK-3beta, MDM2 and p53.",Included

The maximum patient dose values measured in a single procedure were 1405 Gy.cm2 and 10.8 Gy (cumulative skin dose). 11 patients resulted with radiation injuries. Conclusion(s): The application of the SIR-CIRSE Guidelines allowed standardizing the selection criteria to include certain patients in a follow-up program. Several optimization actions were initiated during 2010 and the percentage of patients with risk of skin injuries has substantially decreased.",Excluded

3981,"Effects of lesions in some basal ganglia nuclei and efferent projections on tremorine-induced limb rigidity in rats A mechanical apparatus was used to measure in rats the effects of some unilateral basal ganglia lesions on the hind-limb rigidity produced by the cholinomimetic compound, tremorine. A globus pallidus lesion reduced the resting tone and greatly increased rigidity in the contralateral leg. Lesions in the entopeduncular, subthalamic, and accumbens nuclei had no effects on rigidity, although the entopeduncular nucleus lesion reduced resting limb tone. The role of the globus pallidus in rigidity is significant in relation to work in which striatal lesions abolished tremorine-induced rigidity. Some brain regions that receive basal ganglia efferent fibers received a lesion unilaterally. Lesions in the substantia nigra, red nucleus, or pedunculopontine nucleus had no effect on tremorine-induced rigidity. A habenular lesion significantly reduced rigidity in both hind legs. Very pronounced reductions in rigidity occurred after midbrain lesions involving the central periaqueductal grey region and the superior colliculus. The basal ganglia output pathways that may mediate tremorine rigidity are discussed, together with the possibility that the superior colliculus, which has many muscarinic receptors, may be influenced directly by tremorine.",Excluded
3638,"Structure of the toxic core of alpha-synuclein from invisible crystals The protein alpha-synuclein is the main component of Lewy bodies, the neuron-associated aggregates seen in Parkinson disease and other neurodegenerative pathologies. An 11-residue segment, which we term NACore, appears to be responsible for amyloid formation and cytotoxicity of human alpha-synuclein. Here we describe crystals of NACore that have dimensions smaller than the wavelength of visible light and thus are invisible by optical microscopy. As the crystals are thousands of times too small for structure determination by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we use micro-electron diffraction to determine the structure at atomic resolution. The 1.4 A resolution structure demonstrates that this method can determine previously unknown protein structures and here yields, to our knowledge, the highest resolution achieved by any cryo-electron microscopy method to date. The structure exhibits protofibrils built of pairs of face-to-face beta-sheets. X-ray fibre diffraction patterns show the similarity of NACore to toxic fibrils of full-length alpha-synuclein. The NACore structure, together with that of a second segment, inspires a model for most of the ordered portion of the toxic, full-length alpha-synuclein fibril, presenting opportunities for the design of inhibitors of alpha-synuclein fibrils.",Excluded
3994,"Arachidonic acid potentiates acid-sensing ion channels in rat sensory neurons by a direct action Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are activated by a decrease in extracellular pH. ASICs are expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons, and several lines of evidence suggest that they are responsible for signaling the pain caused by extracellular acidification, but little is understood of the modulation of ASICs by pro-inflammatory factors. Using whole-cell patch clamp we demonstrate that low pH evokes three distinct inward currents in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons: a slowly inactivating transient current, a rapidly inactivating transient current, and a sustained current. All three currents were potentiated by arachidonic acid (AA), to 123%, 171%, and 264% of peak current, respectively. Membrane stretch had no effect on proton-gated currents, implying that AA is unlikely to act via local membrane deformation. The current carried by heterologously expressed ASIC1a and ASIC3 was also potentiated by AA. AA potentiates ASIC activation by a direct mechanism, because inhibition of AA metabolism had no effect on potentiation, and potentiation of single ASIC2a channels could be observed in cell-free patches. Potentiation by lipids with the same chain length as AA increased as the number of double bonds was increased. AA is known to be released in inflammation and the results suggest that AA may be an important pro-inflammatory agent responsible for enhancing acid-mediated pain.",Excluded
4472,"Postnatal development under conditions of simulated weightlessness and space flight The adaptability of the developing nervous system to environmental influences and the mechanisms underlying this plasticity has recently become a subject of interest in space neuroscience. Ground studies on neonatal rats using the tail suspension model of weightlessness have shown that the force of gravity clearly influences the events underlying the postnatal development of motor function. These effects depend on the age of the animal, duration of the perturbation and the motor function studied. A nine-day flight study has shown that a dam and neonates can develop under conditions of space flight. The motor function of the flight animals after landing was consistent with that seen in the tail suspension studies, being marked by limb joint extension. However, there were expected differences due to: (1) the unloading of the vestibular system in flight, which did not occur in the ground-based experiments; (2) differences between flight and suspension durations; and (3) the inability to evaluate motor function during the flight. The next step is to conduct experiments in space with the flexibility and rigor that is now limited to ground studies: an opportunity offered by the International Space Station.",Excluded
4332,"Cerebromicrovascular dysfunction predicts cognitive decline and gait abnormalities in a mouse model of whole brain irradiation-induced accelerated brain senescence Whole brain irradiation (WBI) is a mainstream therapy for patients with both identifiable brain metastases and prophylaxis for microscopic malignancies. However, it also promotes accelerated senescence in healthy tissues and leads to progressive cognitive dysfunction in up to 50% of tumor patients surviving long term after treatment, due to gamma-irradiation-induced cerebromicrovascular injury. Moment-to-moment adjustment of cerebral blood flow (CBF) via neuronal activity-dependent cerebromicrovascular dilation (functional hyperemia) has a critical role in maintenance of healthy cognitive function. To determine whether cognitive decline induced by WBI associates with impaired cerebromicrovascular function, C56BL/6 mice (3 months) subjected to a clinically relevant protocol of fractionated WBI (5 Gy twice weekly for 4 weeks) and control mice were compared. Mice were tested for spatial memory performance (radial arm water maze), sensorimotor coordination (computerized gait analysis, CatWalk), and cerebromicrovascular function (whisker-stimulation-induced increases in CBF, measured by laser Doppler flowmetry) at 3 to 6 months post-irradiation. We found that mice with WBI exhibited impaired cerebromicrovascular function at 3 months post-irradiation, which was associated with impaired performance in the radial arm water maze. At 6 months, post-irradiation progressive impairment in gait coordination (including changes in the regularity index and phase dispersion) was also evident. Collectively, our findings provide evidence for early and persisting neurovascular impairment after a clinically relevant protocol of fractionated WBI, which predict early manifestations of cognitive impairment.",Included
4382,"Feasibility of dose escalation using intraoperative radiotherapy following resection of large brain metastases compared to post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Post-operative SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery) for large brain metastases is challenged by risks of radiation necrosis that limit SRS dose. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a potential alternative, however standard dose recommendations are lacking.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty consecutive brain metastases treated with post-operative SRS were retrospectively compared to IORT plans generated for 10-30 Gy in 1 fraction to 0-5 mm by estimating the applicator size and distance from critical organs using pre-operative and post-operative MRI. Additionally, 7 consecutive patients treated with IORT 30 Gy to surface were compared to retrospectively generated SRS plans using the post-operative MRI to 15-20 Gy and 30 Gy in 1 fraction marginal dose.RESULTS: For the 20 resection cavities treated with SRS and retrospectively compared to IORT, IORT from 10 to 30Gy resulted in lower or not significantly different doses to the optic apparatus and brainstem. Comparatively for the 7 patients treated with IORT 30 Gy to retrospective SRS plans to standard 15-20 Gy and 30 Gy marginal dose, IORT resulted in significantly lower doses to the optic apparatus and brainstem. At a median follow-up of 6.2 months, 86% of patients treated with surgery and IORT achieved local control and 0% developed radiographic or symptomatic radiation necrosis.CONCLUSIONS: Critical organ dosimetry for IORT remains generally lower than that achieved with single fraction SRS following resection of large brain metastases. We recommend 30 Gy to surface as the preferred prescription, consistent with the dose recommendation for IORT in glioblastoma used in the ongoing INTRAGO-II phase-III trial. Early clinical outcomes appear promising for surgery and IORT.",Excluded

Similarly, a few case studies have reported the effectiveness of SBRT for stage I small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, no study has investigated the use of SBRT for extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Compared with conventional RT, SBRT is able to deliver a higher radiation dose precisely and safely to small targets in short-duration treatments. The present study reports the outcome of a patient with ES-SCLC who responded favorably to initial chemotherapy and received SBRT for a residual mass in the peripheral lung. A 62-year-old female presented with pathologically determined SCLC at clinical stage T4N3M0-T4 as separate tumor nodules were present in different ipsilateral lobes. The patient received 6 cycles of standard chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide. The response of the patient to chemotherapy was evaluated using contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography and <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography. The only suspected residual viable tumor was a 1.5-cm mass in the right upper lobe. Targeting this mass, intensity-modulated SBRT was performed with 48 Gy in 4 fractions and 6 MV photons. In addition, prophylactic cranial irradiation was conducted with 25 Gy in 10 fractions. The patient is alive with no evidence of disease 4 years after treatment. SBRT toxicity was limited to radiation pneumonitis or fibrosis without pulmonary symptoms.

3733,"COX-2 inhibitor as a radiation enhancer: New strategies for the treatment of lung cancer Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related mortality throughout the world, and the incidence continues to increase. Smoking is the number one cause of lung cancer. Emerging data have implicated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostanoid production in the pathogenesis of lung carcinoma. In invasive lung tumors, COX-2 upregulation has been reported in up to 90% of cases. COX-2 upregulation is an early event in the development of non-small-cell lung cancer and may be integral to the development of new blood vessels and production of specific proteases that are critical to growth and spread of lung malignancies. COX-2 inhibitors are known to enhance the chemosensitivity in COX-2 overexpressing lung cancer cell lines. Recently, we have demonstrated that selective COX-2 inhibitors also enhance the effect of radiation in COX-2 overexpressed cells. Therefore, inhibitors of COX-2 in combination with chemoradiation therapy may be an alternative strategy that can be tested in clinical trials. The combination of COX-2 inhibitors and radiation suggest a complementary strategy to target angiogenesis while potentially minimizing the impact on quality of life. Currently, several groups are conducting clinical trials in cervix cancer, lung cancer, and brain tumors, using inhibitors of COX-2 in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. These clinical trials will help to elucidate the role of this interesting class.",Excluded

Unloading-induced changes of hemodynamics, metabolic demands and neurohumoral regulation contribute to cardiac atrophy and function declining.

Autopsy at age 59 revealed diffuse changes in the white matter consisting in order of severity of myelin pallor, demyelination, and necrosis which were characterized by a lack of glial reaction. The cerebral cortex was relatively well preserved. As delayed radiation injuries, hyalinous changes in the vascular wall, angiomatous lesions and, fresh and old petechial hemorrhages were found. Moreover, vascular changes associated with arteriosclerosis were also present. Furthermore, a focal glial nodule was detected which was considered to be a new radiation-induced neoplasia.

Recently, combined PET and computed tomographic (CT) scanners have been developed in which the CT data can be used for both anatomical-metabolic image formation and attenuation correction of the PET data. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference between germanium- and CT-based transmission scanning in terms of their radiation doses by using the same measurement technique and to compare the doses that patients receive during brain, cardiac and whole-body scans. Measurement of absorbed doses to organs was conducted by using a Rando Alderson phantom with thermoluminescent dosimeters. Effective doses were calculated according to the guidelines in the International Commission on Radiation Protection Publication Number 60. Compared with radionuclide doses used in routine 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET imaging, doses absorbed during germanium-based transmission scans were almost negligible. On the other hand, absorbed doses from CT-based transmission scans were significantly higher, particularly with a whole-body scanning protocol. Effective doses were 8.81 mSv in the high-speed mode and 18.97 mSv in the high-quality mode for whole-body CT-based transmission scans. These measurements revealed that the doses received by a patient during CT-based transmission scanning are more than those received in a typical PET examination. Therefore, the radiation doses represent a limitation to the generalised use of CT-based transmission measurements with current PET/CT scanner systems.",Excluded

3654,"Optogenetic disruption of sleep continuity impairs memory consolidation Memory consolidation has been proposed as a function of sleep. However, sleep is a complex phenomenon characterized by several features including duration, intensity, and continuity. Sleep continuity is disrupted in different neurological and psychiatric conditions, many of which are accompanied by memory deficits. This finding has raised the question of whether the continuity of sleep is important for memory consolidation. However, current techniques used in sleep research cannot manipulate a single sleep feature while maintaining the others constant. Here, we introduce the use of optogenetics to investigate the role of sleep continuity in memory consolidation. We optogenetically targeted hypocretin/orexin neurons, which play a key role in arousal processes. We used optogenetics to activate these neurons at different intervals in behaving mice and were able to fragment sleep without affecting its overall amount or intensity. Fragmenting sleep after the learning phase of the novel object recognition (NOR) task significantly decreased the performance of mice on the subsequent day, but memory was unaffected if the average duration of sleep episodes was maintained at 62-73% of normal. These findings demonstrate the use of optogenetic activation of arousal-related nuclei as a way to systematically manipulate a specific feature of sleep. We conclude that regardless of the total amount of sleep or sleep intensity, a minimal unit of uninterrupted sleep is crucial for memory consolidation.",Excluded
4720,"Nuclear Import Receptor Inhibits Phase Separation of FUS through Binding to Multiple Sites Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is believed to underlie formation of biomolecular condensates, cellular compartments that concentrate macromolecules without surrounding membranes. Physical mechanisms that control condensate formation/dissolution are poorly understood. The RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) undergoes LLPS in vitro and associates with condensates in cells. We show that the importin karyopherin-beta2/transportin-1 inhibits LLPS of FUS. This activity depends on tight binding of karyopherin-beta2 to the C-terminal proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) of FUS. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses reveal weak interactions of karyopherin-beta2 with sequence elements and structural domains distributed throughout the entirety of FUS. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that most of these same regions also contribute to LLPS of FUS. The data lead to a model where high-affinity binding of karyopherin-beta2 to the FUS PY-NLS tethers the proteins together, allowing multiple, distributed weak intermolecular contacts to disrupt FUS self-association, blocking LLPS. Karyopherin-beta2 may act analogously to control condensates in diverse cellular contexts.",Excluded

To confirm the effect of this approach, we analyzed more patients with long term follow up. Materials/Methods: From January 1992 to Dec 2003, 222 patients (74 T3 and 148 T4 NPC) were treated with hyperfractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) and concomitant chemotherapy (CCT).

We sought to explore this phenomenon in a systematic fashion by evaluating melanoma patients with brain metastases who were treated with both radiation and ipilimumab. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of sixteen consecutive patients who received ipilimumab and 51 courses of braindirected radiation at a single institution from 2008 to 2013. We examined responses of the largest ""index"" extra-cranial lesion after 31 of these courses where imaging was available before and after treatment and compared this response to two consecutive studies performed prior to radiation therapy when available. Overall survival was calculated from the last day of the first brain-directed radiation therapy course using the Kaplan-Meier method. Responses before and after radiation therapy were compared using McNemar's and the binomial tests for clustered data. Twogroup exact tests for clustered data were used to explore the impact of treatment timing on response. Result(s): Median survival after initial radiation was 14 months, with maximum survival of 50 months. After radiation therapy, the largest index extra-cranial lesion shrank in 35% of 31 instances with sequential imaging as compared to a 17% favorable response rate in the 25 instances with two scans prior to radiation (p = 0.20). There was also a 2.8-fold increased likelihood that the kinetics of index lesion response improved following radiation therapy that did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07). Index lesions were more likely to respond when ipilimumab was administered within three months of radiation (p<0.01). Conclusion(s): Historical series of melanoma patients with brain metastases describe median survival of less than 6 months, and less than 4 months in patients treated with radiation therapy without surgery for these lesions. Our data suggest patients treated with ipilimumab and radiation therapy may fare better than these historical controls. There was a trend for favorable systemic response following radiation therapy worthy of further evaluation in studies powered to detect potential synergies between radiation and immunotherapy.",Excluded

The hyperactive neuron was unaffected by electrical stimulation of the nucleus raphe dorsalis (NRD) and locus ceruleus (LC). Administration of phenytoin and diazepam reduced the firing. However, no effect was seen with valproic acid. During spreading depression of the sensorimotor cortex, a remarkable reduction was seen on the firing of thalamic hyperactive neurons.

In this Practice Point we discuss a randomized, phase III trial by Hermes and colleagues, which included 220 patients with extensive-disease small cell lung cancer and showed superiority of carboplatin-irinotecan versus carboplatin-oral etoposide. In this trial, 47% of patients had a performance status >=3 and 35% were older than 70 years, which represents a typical clinical practice population of patients; however, oral administration of etoposide and an arbitrary dose reduction in elderly and unfit patients represent limitations of the study. A European trial of irinotecan-carboplatin versus intravenous etoposide-carboplatin has completed accrual and results will be analyzed in 2009. Although the results of the study by Hermes et al. are of interest, substitution of etoposide by irinotecan can not be recommended.",Excluded
4723,"Radioresistant DNA synthesis and human genetic diseases Sixty-eight human fibroblast cell strains were assayed for radioresistant DNA synthesis (RDS), which is defined here as the absence of a steep component of inhibition of DNA synthesis in a dose-response curve when rate of DNA synthesis is plotted against radiation doses from 0 to 20 Gy or more. Twenty-seven strains from patients who were previously diagnosed to have ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) were positive for this feature. Among the cell strains that did not show RDS were two from AT obligate heterozygotes (i.e., the parents of AT patients), two from patients with Alzheimer disease, two from patients with Friedreich ataxia, one from a patient with Bloom syndrome, one from a patient with Down syndrome, and six from patients with various immunodeficiencies. Four strains demonstrated RDS that was less pronounced than in most AT cells: one was from a patient with Nijmegen breakage syndrome, one was from a patient without ataxia but with choreiform movement disorder, telangiectasia, and elevated concentrations of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood, and two were from AT patients. RDS therefore is not a necessary trait of human genetic diseases that involve radiosensitivity or immunodeficiency. Although recent reports suggest that some AT patients do not exhibit RDS, we found RDS in all the AT cells we tested.",Excluded
3880,"Radiation dose during coronary angiography: Correlation to body mass index Introduction: Coronary angiography (CAG) is a commonly performed procedure in cardiology, resulting in patients being exposed to radiation. Patients with high body mass index (BMI) are at increased risk of coronary artery disease. Catheter laboratory intensifiers use automatic exposure control (AEC) which adjusts radiation dose aiming to provide optimal quality images. Factors shown to be responsible for dose variability are complexity of the procedure, operator experience, their level of training in radiation protection, type and performance of x-ray equipment. The objective of present study was to evaluate if radiation dose received by patients correlated with BMI. Method(s): Retrospective data for 3678 CAG performed from Sep-07 to Mar-10 from a single centre, were analysed. Radiation dose was calculated as Dose Area Product (DAP) in mGym . Result(s): Mean radiation dose during the procedure was 4339 +/- 286 mGym . Mean BMI, contrast volume used and screening time were 29.22 +/- 0.08 kg/m2, 125 +/- 10.0 ml and 5.2 +/- 0.1 minutes respectively. BMI was positively correlated with increasing radiation dose during CAG (graph-1 &2). Patients with increased BMI did not require prolonged procedure or increased contrast volume. There was no significant inter-operator variability. Even Ten degree increase in angulation (oblique, cranial or caudal) increased radiation dose significantly. Conclusion(s): Patients with increased BMI receive a significantly higher radiation dose during CAG, affecting not only the patient, but every one present in the catheter laboratory. This has to be recognized by the operator when undertaking procedures in patients with a high BMI.",Excluded
4070,"Long-term clinical safety of high proton radiation doses delivered with pencil beam scanning paradigm to the spinal cord for extracranial malignancies Purpose/Objective(s): Standardly employed radiotherapy dose limits for the spinal cord tend to be very conservative. Historical data from re-irradiation and combined photon/proton beam series suggest that the tolerance might be much higher. Nevertheless, uncertainties persist due to short follow-up, mixed techniques, and dose summation in these efforts. To add further clarity, we analyzed our institutional experience regarding the incidence of radiation-induced spinal cord toxicity following treatment exclusively with high dose, pencil beam scanning proton therapy (PBSPT). Materials/Methods: Seventy two patients (median age: 51, range 23-79; male/female ratio 1:1), treated for spinal chordoma (n=51) or chondrosarcoma (n=21), met the following criteria and were retrospectively analyzed: maximum dose to the spinal cord of >= 45 Gy (RBE), proton therapy only, >= 18 years of age, and clinical follow-up of >12 months. Patients received 64.0 e 74.4 Gy (RBE) (median: 74.0 Gy (RBE)), generally with 1.8-2.0 Gy (RBE) per fraction, between 2000 and 2014. The Dmax, D2%, V40, V45, V50, V55, and V60 of the spinal cord (SC) and center of spinal cord (CSC; 2-3 mm diameter ROI at geometric center of the cord) were calculated for all patients. Median follow-up was 66 months (range: 13-160 months). Toxicity was scored according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03). Descriptive and linear regression analyses were performed. Result(s): Patients received a mean Dmax / D2% to the spinal cord of 59 Gy (RBE) / 55 Gy (RBE) and to the CSC of 52 Gy (RBE) / 51 Gy (RBE), respectively. Four patients (6%) developed acute radiation-induced neurologic toxicity (Grade 1: nZ1, Grade 2: nZ3). Seventeen percent of patients experienced minor late neurologic toxicities (Grade 1: nZ7, Grade 2: nZ4). Of these patients, 4 developed Lhermitte's syndrome. One patient experienced Grade 4 toxicity (tetraplegia) after receiving 58 Gy (RBE) to the surface and 54 Gy (RBE) to the CSC (SC: V45 11.8 cc, V50 9.35 cc; CSC: V40 3.17 cc, V45 3.1 cc). Of note, the patient was considered high-risk due to postoperative, transient tetraparesis prior to PBSPT and potential spinal instability with a narrow canal. On final analysis, no significant correlation was found between spinal cord Dmax, CSC Dmax, or length of CTV and toxicity. However, higher CSC Dmax and longer CTV tended to correlate with >= Grade 2 neurologic toxicity, but this was not statistically significant. Conclusion(s): PBSPTwith spinal cord doses of up to 60Gy(RBE) to the surface and 50Gy (RBE) to the center is associatedwithminimal spinal toxicity. In our experience, doses up to 64 Gy (RBE) to the surface of the spinal cord are deemed acceptable if unavoidable in achieving adequate tumor coverage.",Excluded
4460,"Clonogenic neoblasts are pluripotent adult stem cells that underlie planarian regeneration Pluripotent cells in the embryo can generate all cell types, but lineage-restricted cells are generally thought to replenish adult tissues. Planarians are flatworms and regenerate from tiny body fragments, a process requiring a population of proliferating cells (neoblasts). Whether regeneration is accomplished by pluripotent cells or by the collective activity of multiple lineage-restricted cell types is unknown. We used ionizing radiation and single-cell transplantation to identify neoblasts that can form large descendant-cell colonies in vivo. These clonogenic neoblasts (cNeoblasts) produce cells that differentiate into neuronal, intestinal, and other known postmitotic cell types and are distributed throughout the body. Single transplanted cNeoblasts restored regeneration in lethally irradiated hosts. We conclude that broadly distributed, adult pluripotent stem cells underlie the remarkable regenerative abilities of planarians.",Excluded

4308,"Tm:fiber laser ablation with real-time temperature monitoring for minimizing collateral thermal damage: ex vivo dosimetry for ovine brain BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The thermal damage of the surrounding tissue can be an unwanted result of continuous-wave laser irradiations. In order to propose an effective alternative to conventional surgical techniques, photothermal damage must be taken under control by a detailed dose study. Real-time temperature monitoring can be also an effective way to get rid of these negative effects. The aim of the present study is to investigate the potential of a new laser-thermoprobe, which consists of a continuous-wave 1,940-nm Tm:fiber laser and a thermocouple measurement system for brain surgery in an ex vivo study.STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: A laser-thermoprobe was designed for using the near-by tissue temperature as a real-time reference for the applicator. Fresh lamb brain tissues were used for experiments. 320 laser shots were performed on both cortical and subcortical tissue.RESULTS: The relationship between laser parameters, temperature changes, and ablation (removal of tissue) efficiency was determined. The correlation between rate of temperature change and ablation efficiency was calculated.CONCLUSION: Laser-thermoprobe leads us to understand the basic laser-tissue interaction mechanism in a very cheap and easy way, without making a change in the experimental design. It was also shown that the ablation and coagulation (thermally irreversible damage) diameters could be predicted, and carbonization can be avoided by temperature monitoring.",Excluded
3841,"Missense mutations but not allelic variants alter the function of ATM by dominant interference in patients with breast cancer The human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is characterized by hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and an elevated risk of malignancy. Epidemiological data support an increased risk for breast and other cancers in A-T heterozygotes. However, screening breast cancer cases for truncating mutations in the ATM (A-T mutated) gene has failed largely to reveal an increased incidence in these patients. It has been hypothesized that ATM missense mutations are implicated in breast cancer, and there is some evidence to support this. The presence of a large variety of rare missense variants in addition to common polymorphisms in ATM makes it difficult to establish such a relationship by association studies. To investigate the functional significance of these changes we have introduced missense substitutions, identified in either A-T or breast cancer patients, into ATM cDNA before establishing stable cell lines to determine their effect on ATM function. Pathogenic missense mutations and neutral missense variants were distinguished initially by their capacity to correct the radiosensitive phenotype in A-T cells. Furthermore missense mutations abolished the radiation-induced kinase activity of ATM in normal control cells, caused chromosome instability, and reduced cell viability in irradiated control cells, whereas neutral variants failed to do so. Mutant ATM was expressed at the same level as endogenous protein, and interference with normal ATM function seemed to be by multimerization. This approach represents a means of identifying genuine ATM mutations and addressing the significance of missense changes in the ATM gene in a variety of cancers including breast cancer.",Excluded
4334,"Edaravone protects ovaries from radiation-induced apoptosis Objective: Ovaries are very sensitive and prone to radiation-related damage. Radiation impairs the ovaries by triggering apoptosis of follicular cells and chromosomal damage and oxidative stress. Edaravone is a potent free radical scavenger, which has been clinically used to treat the neuronal damage following acute ischemic stroke. Our purpose is to evaluate the protective effects of edaravone and to investigate the histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in rat ovaries after radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty two Wistar albino female rats were randomly divided into four groups. 1: control group, 2: sham group (only radiation), 3: 450 mg/kg edaravone and radiation group, 4: 45 mg/kg edaravone and radiation group. Four days after radiation exposure, the rats were sacrificed and the ovaries were removed. Histologic changes under light microscopy and immunoreactivity for anticaspase-3 were noted and compared between the four groups. Result(s): There was a statistically significant difference in follicle counts, vascular congestion, edema, cytoplasmic vacuolization and interstitial cell degeneration between the groups. Radiation causes deterioration of histopathological parameters. Administration of edaravone at different doses seems to reverse these alterations and alleviate the injury. Antioxidant defense mechanisms appear to be enhanced by edaravone. Conclusion(s): This is the first study evaluating the protective effects of edaravone on radiation-induced ovarian damage. Edaravone decreased the follicule apoptosis and attenuates ovarian damage induced radiation in rats.",Included
4206,"Automated image enhancement significantly reduces radiation dosage in coronary angiographt with preserved image quality Aims: Radiation exposure is related with adverse events on population level. For healthcare workers the work related radiation dose allowed is limited by governing agencies for health purposes. Although the dosage patients receive is relatively limited, the as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA) principle remains applicable. ClarityIQ is developed to reduce the radiation exposure without loss of image quality. Methods and Results: Diagnostic coronary angiography images of the left coronary artery (LCA) were acquired in LAO 45 with 20 cranial angulation with hand injected contrast dye. Quality of ClarityIQ (50% radiation reduction) was compared with standard image acquisition (100% radiation exposure) and scored as better, good, fair and poor by the operator. Our preliminary data show that 47 patients (mean age 62.8+/-11.1) were enrolled. The mean BMI was 26.6 kg/m2+/-3.7. All had normal kidney function (MDRD >60) and no known previous myocardial infarction of the LCA. The image quality of the ClarityIQ images was of adequate diagnostic quality in all patients. ClarityIQ was not considered of better quality, in 29 cases the image quality was good and in 17 fair. In one case the operator judged the images poor based on a blurred aspect of the coronary tree, but still useful for diagnostic coronary angiography. The mean Air Kerma was 31.3 J/kg for ClarityIQ and 72.9 J/kg for the standard image acquisition (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that with a novel acquisition technique that enhances the coronary tree based on a computer algorithm adequate images can be acquired with a reduction of 43% of radiation dose. Thus resulting in less stochastic effects of radiation for the cath-lab personnel and also less deterministic effects for the patient. Further research is needed to assess whether ClarityIQ is also suitable for large patients and different angulations.",Excluded
3818,"Exercise as a countermeasure to psycho-physiological deconditioning during long-term confinement Confinement studies are performed to simulate the psychological effects that may be experienced on a long-term space flight. A general psycho-physiological model assumes that mood and cognitive functioning are impaired during confinement as a result of an absence of physical activity. The aim of the MARS500 study initiated by the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) and the European Space Agency (ESA) is to gather data, knowledge and experience to help prepare for a real mission to Mars. A test run with 105 days of isolation was performed prior to 520 days of isolation. Psycho-physiological data of this study are presented here. We hypothesized that exercise, as it has been shown in laboratory settings, would be able to prevent and counteract mood changes during isolation. Electrocortical data (EEG) and a self report on current psychological and physical state were recorded several times prior to and after exercise during the isolation period. Data revealed a clear effect of exercise on mood and electrocortical activity. Moreover, it was shown that mood and brain cortical activity decreased during the first 11 weeks of isolation and reached baseline again in the last week of isolation. A correlation analysis revealed a significant relation between mood data and electrocortical activity. We conclude (1) that confinement is accompanied by psycho-physiological changes and (2) that exercise is a suitable method to counteract psycho-physiological deconditioning during confinement.",Excluded
4378,"Magnetic resonance based small animal radiotherapy in neuro-oncology Compared to computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides vastly superior soft-tissue contrast. This makes it much easier to visualize lesion boundaries that will result in a much better delineation of the target volume, helping to better irradiate the lesion and avoid surrounding tissue.Therefore, combining MRI with CT data is increasingly used for radiotherapy planning in the clinic. This combined CT/MRI dataset contains both the information required for targeting and for dose calculations. During this presentation, three studies will be presented where MRI and small animal radiotherapy were combined in the field of neuro-oncology. In a first study, we used a combined CT/MRI dataset to guide the irradiation of brain tumours in a F98 glioblastoma rat model using a micro-irradiator. Contrast-enhanced MRI images were acquired to follow up tumour growth after orthotopic inoculation, to monitor treatment response, and to delineate the target volume during radiotherapy planning. Using multiple non-coplanar arcs the prescribed dose could be delivered to 90% of the target volume, while minimizing the dose to normal brain tissue. A challenging aspects of small animal CT imaging relates to the radiation dose received by the animals. This might become a very important issue when the therapeutic dose has to be delivered in multiple fractions spaced over time, where each individual irradiation requires a CT for accurate animal positioning. Therefore, in a second study we investigated the feasibility of a MRI-only based workflow for radiotherapy planning of the rat brain, that enables both accurate target delineation and accurate dose calculations using only MRI-based volumes. Multiple MRI sequences were used to generate synthetic CT images that could be used for dose calculations, because only one MRI volume was not sufficient to separate all major tissue types (air, soft tissue, bone) in the rat head. The synthetic CT images were sufficiently similar to the segmented CT images that are routinely used for radiotherapy planning on preclinical radiation research platforms. No significant differences were observed between CT and MRI based dose calculations when more complex beam configurations (multiple beams) were used in the dose plan. However, further research is required in the thoracic or abdominal region of small animals, where more tissue classes will be required to allow for accurate dose calculations compared to the rat head. Finally, discrimination between brain tumor recurrence (glioblastoma) and radiation necrosis (RN) remains a diagnostic challenge because both entities have similar imaging characteristics on conventional MRI. Functional imaging techniques, such as dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI or positron emission tomography (PET), could overcome this diagnostic dilemma. A third study will be presented to investigate the potential of DCE-MRI and PET in discriminating high-grade glioma from RN in rats. Induction of RN was achieved by irradiating the right frontal region with 60 Gy using multiple arcs. Results suggested that functional imaging can be used to discriminate glioblastoma (recurrence) from RN. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded
3919,"Connecting radiotherapy with targeted anti-glioma therapy using superparamagnetic nanoparticles conjugated with granzyme B INTRODUCTION: 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) is overexpressed on the membrane of the glioblastoma cells, but not on corresponding normal cells. Membrane-bound Hsp70 (i.e., mHsp70) is rapidly internalized into tumor cells and thus targeting the protein might provide a promising strategy for theranostics. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are contrast negative agents that are used for the detection of tumors with MRI. In the presented study we conjugated the protease Granzyme B which is known to recognize mHsp70 to superparamagnetic iron nanoparticles to assess tumor-specific theranostic targeting before and after radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Synthesized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles covered with Granzyme B protease (GrB-SPIONs) were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering, NMR relaxometry. Cellular interactions of the GrB-SPIONs conjugates with tumor cell lines (i.e., U87, LN229, C6, K562, HeLa) were assessed using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and TEM. Brain tumor targeting was analyzed in the orthotopic C6 glioma model in rats, human U87 and LN229 gliomas in nu/nu mice. Following intravenous administration retention of the nanoparticles in the tumor site was assessed using high-field 11.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with subsequent histological assay. Biodistribution studies of the SPIONs were performed by NLR-M2 measurements. Combination of the nanoparticle targeting with radiotherapy of the brain tumors was performed at small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) (Xstrahl Inc., UK) using single of fractionated irradiation. RESULT(S): In vitro experiments demonstrated the selectivity of GrB-SPIONs conjugates to free and mHsp70 in different tumor cell types in a dose-dependent manner. High-resolution MRI on T2-weighted images showed the retention of the conjugates in C6 glioma model in rats, and U87 and LN229 human orthotopic glioma models in nu/nu mice. Accumulation of GrB-SPION nanoparticles in the glioma resulted in many-fold drop of T2-values in comparison to non-conjugated SPIONs. Biodistribution analysis using NLR-M2 measurements showed an increase in the tumor-to-background (normal brain) uptake ratio of GrB-SPIONs conjugates in glioma-bearing animals in comparison to SPIONs. Accumulation within Hsp70-positive glioma was enhanced after a single dose (10 Gy) of ionizing radiation. Combination of the radiotherapy and application of the GrB-SPIONs significantly increased the survival of the glioma-bearing animals. CONCLUSION(S): Elevated accumulation of the functionalized magnetic nanoparticles in the tumor due to radiosensitization proves the combination of radiotherapy and application of Hsp70-targeted agents such as Granzyme B in the theranostics of brain tumors.",Excluded

To evaluate changes of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in irradiated brain metastases arterial spin-labeling techniques (ASL) were applied and compared to the outcome of (1)H MR spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging ((1)H MRS, SI).PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2 patients follow-up examinations of irradiated brain metastases were performed on a 1.5-T tomograph (average single dose: 20 Gy/80% isodose). Relative CBF values of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM),and metastases (Met) were measured by means of the ASL techniques ITS-FAIR and Q2TIPS. (1)H MRS was performed with PRESS 1500/135.RESULTS: In both patients with initially hyperperfused metastases (Met/GM >1) the reduction of rCBF after stereotactic radiosurgery indicated response to treatment--even if the contrast-enhancing region increased--while increasing rCBF values indicated tumor progression. The findings were confirmed by (1)H MRS, SI and subsequent follow-up.CONCLUSION: The ASL techniques ITS-FAIR and Q2TIPS are able to monitor changes of rCBF in irradiated brain metastases.

We studied the responses of single MLd neurons to four types of modulated sounds: 1) white noise; 2) band-limited noise; 3) frequency modulated (FM) sweeps, and 4) sinusoidally amplitude-modulated tones (SAM) in adult male zebra finches. Responses were compared with the responses of the same neurons to pure tones in terms of temporal response patterns, thresholds, characteristic frequencies, frequency tuning bandwidths, tuning sharpness, and spike rate/intensity relationships. Most neurons responded well to noise. More than one-half of the neurons responded selectively to particular portions of the noise, suggesting that, unlike forebrain neurons, many MLd neurons can encode specific acoustic components of highly modulated sounds such as noise. Selectivity for FM sweep direction was found in only 13% of cells that responded to sweeps. Those cells also showed asymmetric tuning curves, suggesting that asymmetric inhibition plays a role in FM directional selectivity. Responses to SAM showed that MLd neurons code temporal modulation rates using both spike rate and synchronization. Nearly all cells showed low-pass or band-pass filtering properties for SAM. Best modulation frequencies matched the temporal modulations in zebra finch song. Results suggest that auditory midbrain neurons are well suited for encoding a wide range of complex sounds with a high degree of temporal accuracy rather than selectively responding to only some sounds.",Excluded

This study estimated the effective dose (ED) from DLP measurements using the appropriate k-factors. SSDE was calculated from the product of CTDIvol with the appropriate conversion factor, based on the sum of the lateral and anteroposterior diameters. Results are compared with international DRL data. Result(s): Compared to national DRLs, the local DRLs regarding the CTDIvol values were lower by 14% for Abdomen-Pelvis, 43% for Brain and 25% for Chest-Abdomen-Pelvis exams. For CTPA and heart exams national DRLs were not suggested. In comparison to international DRLs, the picture of our results is mixed, having both higher and lower DRLs than other countries.

3685,Late neoplastic complications after radiation treatments for benign intracranial tumors There is increasing interest in the use of radiation treatment as an adjunct or an alternative to microsurgery in the management of a range of intracranial tumors. Most of these treatments are performed with linear accelerator or Gamma Knife systems. Precise targeting with stereotactic localization minimizes the volume of tissue being irradiated for single and multiple fraction irradiation. The incidence of secondary neoplasms after radiosurgery may be significantly less than that reported after whole-brain or two- or three-field radiotherapy. [References: 19],Excluded

4819,"Matched-filter coding of sky polarization results in an internal sun compass in the brain of the desert locust Many animals use celestial cues for spatial orientation. These include the sun and, in insects, the polarization pattern of the sky, which depends on the position of the sun. The central complex in the insect brain plays a key role in spatial orientation. In desert locusts, the angle of polarized light in the zenith above the animal and the direction of a simulated sun are represented in a compass-like fashion in the central complex, but how both compasses fit together for a unified representation of external space remained unclear. To address this question, we analyzed the sensitivity of intracellularly recorded central-complex neurons to the angle of polarized light presented from up to 33 positions in the animal's dorsal visual field and injected Neurobiotin tracer for cell identification. Neurons were polarization sensitive in large parts of the virtual sky that in some cells extended to the horizon in all directions. Neurons, moreover, were tuned to spatial patterns of polarization angles that matched the sky polarization pattern of particular sun positions. The horizontal components of these calculated solar positions were topographically encoded in the protocerebral bridge of the central complex covering 360degree of space. This whole-sky polarization compass does not support the earlier reported polarization compass based on stimulation from a small spot above the animal but coincides well with the previously demonstrated direct sun compass based on unpolarized light stimulation. Therefore, direct sunlight and whole-sky polarization complement each other for robust head direction coding in the locust central complex.",Excluded

A. calamus extract (250 mg/kg body weight) was orally administered to mice 1 h prior to whole body gamma-radiation exposure. The antioxidant levels in the tissue homogenates of brain, liver and kidney of the irradiated mice were determined and cellular DNA damage was monitored by comet assay. Effect of administration of the extract on survival of the animals exposed to acute lethal dose of 10 Gy whole body gamma-radiations was also monitored. Administration of the extract significantly increased the activities of major enzymes of the antioxidant defense system specially SOD, catalase and GPx and levels of GSH in 2, 6 and 10 Gy irradiated mice and decreased the formation MDA. The extract also decreased DNA strand breaks. The survival rate was found to be increased up to 5%. These studies highlight the role of A. calamus extract as good source of natural radioprotecting agent and its therapeutic implications for radiation-induced injuries.",Included

The rats were randomly divided into four equal groups. The control group did not receive melatonin or irradiation but received both 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally and sham irradiation. The irradiation (IR) group received 5 Gy gamma irradiation to the total cranium as a single dose plus 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally. The melatonin plus IR group received irradiation to the total cranium plus 5 mg/kg/day melatonin intraperitoneally. The melatonin group received only 5 mg/kg/day melatonin plus sham-irradiation. Biochemical parameters measured in murine lenses were carried out using spectrophotometric techniques.RESULTS: Lens antioxidant capacity, as measured by levels of total superoxide scavenger activity (TSSA), non-enzymatic superoxide scavenger activity (NSSA) and glutathione reductase (GRD) activity, significantly increased in melatonin, control and melatonin plus IR groups when compared with the IR group. Lens glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity significantly increased in control and melatonin groups when compared with the IR group. Lens malondialdehyde (MDA) levels significantly increased in the IR group when compared with control, melatonin and melatonin plus IR groups. Lens TSSA and NSSA activities significantly decreased in control and melatonin plus IR groups when compared with the melatonin group. Lens GST activity significantly increased in the control group when compared with melatonin plus IR group. Lens GRD activity significantly increased in melatonin and melatonin plus IR groups when compared with control group.CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin reduces oxidative stress markers and augments anti-oxidant capacity in the rat lens.",Included

The extent of retinal damage was determined histologically. Daily exposure to bright light in the morning produced greater photoreceptor loss than daily afternoon exposure. Severe retinal damage was partially prevented by brief light adaptation (20 minutes duration, at 1.4 log ftc intensity) before the onset of morning exposure. However, light adaptation did not remove the differential effect of time of day.

4451,"Defining the mechanisms that underlie cortical hyperexcitability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS] is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder of motor neurons, heralded by the development of cortical hyperexcitability. Reduction of short interval intracortical inhibition [SICI] in ALS, a feature linked to the development of cortical hyperexcitability, may be mediated by degeneration of inhibitory circuits or alternatively activation of high threshold excitatory circuits. As such, determining the mechanisms of SICI reduction in ALS has clear diagnostic and therapeutic significance. Consequently, the present study utilized a novel threshold tracking paired-pulse paradigm to determine whether SICI reduction in ALS represented reduced inhibition or excessive excitation. Using a 90 mm circular coil, SICI was assessed at three different conditioning stimulus intensities: 40%, 70% and 90% of resting motor threshold [RMT]. Motor evoked potential responses were recorded over the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. Short interval intracortical inhibition was uniformly reduced across all three levels of conditioning intensities in ALS [40% RMT, ALS -0.6+/-0.7%, controls 2.0+/-0.6%, P<0.01; 70% RMT, ALS 0.6+/-2.7%, controls 12.8+/-2%, P<0.001; 90% RMT, ALS -15.9+/-1.3%, controls 2.2+/-4.1%, P<0.01]. In addition, the resting motor threshold was reduced, while the motor evoked potential amplitude was increased in ALS patients, in keeping with cortical hyperexcitability. These findings establish that SICI reduction in ALS represents degeneration of inhibitory cortical circuits, combined with excessive excitation of high threshold excitatory pathways. Neuroprotective strategies aimed at preserving the integrity of intracortical inhibitory circuits, in addition to antagonizing excitatory cortical circuits, may provide novel therapeutic targets in ALS.",Excluded

4338,"Clinical Evaluation of a Rotational Set-up Correction Device for Multiple Brain Metastases Using Single-Isocenter Stereotactic Radiation Therapy Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) using a single plan with one isocenter by helical tomotherapy (HT) can simultaneously treat multiple brain metastases with highly conformal dose distributions. This may reduce treatment time and intra-fractional motion. However, rotational set-up errors in the pitch and yaw angles cannot be corrected in the HT system. Therefore, increases in rotational set-up error and distance of the target-to-rotational-center may be associated with significant dosimetric uncertainties with this irradiation technique. Previous research shows that when rotational errors are increased to 2.0degree, the prescription doses which cover 95% of the planning target volume were only 63% of all tested cases. Here, we developed a new head supporting device that allows for a highly-accurate correction of rotational errors during image-guided radiation therapy. In this study, we investigated the amounts of rotational correction required prior to irradiation, and evaluated the dosimetric efficacy of rotational correction for SRT, using HT unit to treat multiple brain metastases. Materials/Methods: A novel rotational set-up correction device was constructed from carbon material and conjected with the commonly-used head shell system on the top of our device. We were able to rotate in 0.1degree increments for pitch and yaw angles using two screws. We retrospectively analyzed data from three patients irradiated by single-isocenter SRT for multiple brain metastases using the HT unit. The SRT plans were created with 30 Gy in three fractions prescribed for D99% to clinical target volumes. The required rotational correction values were determined by mega-voltage computed tomography (MVCT) before irradiation. Residual correction values were quantified after correction by the developed device. Moreover, dosimetric efficacy was evaluated using the calculated dose distribution with MVCT after rotational correction. Dose distribution was compared between 4D (three horizontal axes + roll) and 6D correction. We clarified efficacy of rotational correction depending on the distance of the target-to-rotational-center. Result(s): The rotational correction for pitch was 1.2degree +/- 1.7degree, roll: 0.9degree +/- 1.2degree, and yaw: 1.3degree +/- 1.6degree. The maximum correction value in pitch and yaw was 3.0degree. The residual correction value after rotational correction was 0.2degree +/- 0.3degree in both pitch and yaw angles. The difference in target dose between 4D and 6D corrections was improved by 2.5% in coverage index, and 1.0% on D99%. Dosimetric efficacy of rotational correction did not depend on the distance of the target-to-rotational-center. This suggests that irradiated doses for brain metastases in any location can be improved. Conclusion(s): Novel rotational set-up correction device can be corrected to within 0.5degree in pitch and yaw angle error, and benefited rotational correction and irradiated dose distribution for single-isocenter SRT for multiple brain metastases.

4538,"Event-triggered neuroadaptive control for postcapture spacecraft with ultralow-frequency actuator updates This paper investigates an event-triggered neuroadaptive control approach for postcapture flexible spacecraft with guaranteed prespecified tracking performance in the presence of unknown inertial properties, actuator constraints, and external space perturbations. By employing the minimum-learning parameter technique into the neural proportional integral-like controller, only two adaptive parameters are required to update online, which completely avoids the tedious inertial parameter identifications and dramatically reduces the complexity of controller in the meanwhile. Compared with existing works, the primary advantage of the proposed attitude control approach is that the actuator updates are determined by the prescribed event-based conditions in an aperiodic way rather than a periodic one, which greatly reduces the actuator updates. Finally, two groups of illustrative examples are organized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of attitude stabilization and tracking for the postcapture flexible spacecraft.

The 1-year local control rates after single-fraction stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for brain metastases >3 cm diameter are less than 70%, but with fractionated SRT (FSRT) higher local control rates have been reported. The purpose of this study was to compare our treatment results with SRT and FSRT for large brain metastases.Materials and methods. In two consecutive periods, 41 patients with 46 brain metastases received SRT with 1 fraction of 15 Gy, while 51 patients with 65 brain metastases received FSRT with 3 fractions of 8 Gy. We included patients with brain metastases with a planning target volume of >13 cm3 or metastases in the brainstem.Results. The minimum follow-up of patients still alive was 22 months. Comparing 1 fraction of 15 Gy with 3 fractions of 8 Gy, the 1-year rates of freedom from any local progression (54% and 61%, p=0.93) and pseudo progression (85% and 75%, p=0.25) were not significantly different. Overall survival rates were also not different.Conclusion. The 1-year local progression and pseudo progression rates after 1 fraction of 15 Gy or 3 fractions of 8 Gy for large brain metastases and metastases in the brainstem are similar.

The underlying hypothesis was that TRT will improve outcomes in this favorable patient population.METHODS: 305 patients were included in an institutional review board (IRB)-approved study, of which 105 received TRT after chemotherapy (ChT) and 200 received ChT alone. The survival outcomes were compared between ChT+TRT group and ChT-alone group in patients with oligometastasis without brain or liver involved and patients with brain/liver/multimetastasis, respectively.RESULTS: The 1-year, 2-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) for all patients were 60.3%, 23.9% and 1.6%, respectively. The addition of TRT significantly improved PFS in total patients than ChT alone (14.5 months vs. 10.1 months, p = 0.006), but the OS benefit was not significant (17.8 months vs. 16.5 months, p = 0.061). For patients with oligometastasis (n = 118), TRT offered significant progression free survival (PFS) (16.5 months vs. 9.1 months, p = 0.005) and OS (19.2 months vs. 15.6 months, p = 0.039) benefits.

4057,"Peptide receptor radionuclide therapies (PRRTs): Which are the dosimetric data for the patients? Introduction: NeuroEndocrine Tumours (NETs) belong to a relatively rare class of neoplasms. Nonetheless, their prevalence has increased significantly during the last decades. Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) therapeutic effect is based on the binding of radiolabelled somatostatin analogue peptides with NETs' somatostatin receptors, resulting in internal irradiation of tumours. Pre-therapeutic patient-specific dosimetry is essential for a treatment course with high levels of safety and efficacy. This study reviews the methods and dosimetric results of PRRT dosimetry presented in the literature. Focus is given on data concerning the therapeutic somatostatin analogue radiopeptides <sup>111</sup>In-[DTPA<sup>0</sup>,DPhe<sup>1</sup>]- octreotide (<sup>111</sup>In-DTPA-octreotide), <sup>90</sup>Y-[DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>]-octreotide (<sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC) and <sup>177</sup>Lu-[DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>,Thr<sup>8</sup>]-octreotide (<sup>177</sup>Lu- DOTATATE).

Furthermore, papers presented herein were published during the last 15 years (1999 - 2013), with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE studies being published during the last 4 years (2010 - 2013). Additionally, selection was limited to papers providing dosimetric data for at least two regions of interest. Result(s): Dosimetric results are provided for tumors, kidneys, red marrow, liver and spleen, Following Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) committee formalism, dosimetric analysis demonstrates large interpatient variability in tumour and organ uptake, with kidneys and bone marrow being the critical organs. Results are dependent on the image acquisition and processing protocol, as well as the dosimetric imaging radiopharmaceutical. Discussion(s): The large interpatient variability in tumour and organ uptake stresses the need for personalized therapy planning. Patient-specific dosimetry in PRRT is therefore needed, in order for the fixed dose regimens to be replaced with patient-tailored therapy planning. Kidney absorbed doses are higher in PRRT with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC, allowing for higher <sup>177</sup>Lu activities to be administered in <sup>177</sup>Lu- DOTATATE therapies.

Ninety-one patients received PCI (30 Gy/15 or 25 Gy/10) and 64 patients did not receive PCI. Survival was compared in a landmark analysis that included only patients who had stable disease or better in response to primary therapy.RESULTS: Patients who received PCI had better survival than patients who did not receive PCI (median survival 12.0 months vs. 7.6 months, 3-year overall survival 13.2% vs. 3.1%, HR = 0.53 [95% CI 0.36-0.78], p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, the only factor that remained significant for survival was stage (ESCLC vs. LSCLC, p = 0.0072). In contrast, the multivariate analysis of patients who had ESCLC revealed that PCI was the sole factor associated with a survival advantage (HR = 0.47 [95% CI 0.24-0.93], p = 0.03).

4261,"Benefits of dual energy CT imaging for differentiating contrast staining versus haemorrhage in post thrombectomy patients Background: Due to the increase in Neurological Thrombectomy cases, we reviewed our 24 hour post procedural unenhanced CT head scan implemented to look for haemorrhagic transformation within the infarct. High attenuation signal can frequently be seen on unenhanced CT scan in these patients within the core infarct and is impossible to differentiate between iodine staining or haemorrhagic transformation. Evaluation of these images has always been subjective with no true diagnosis. Dual Energy CT is an established imaging modality in differentiation of iodine and haemorrhage in high density lesions, post clot retrieval or after contrast administration. Dual energy CT involves acquiring two simultaneous attenuation datasets at a high and low kV. The ratio of the difference in Hounsfield units in these two datasets gives us the ability to accurately differentiate different tissues. Utilising three material decomposition and iodine maps, virtual non-contrast images are created on the Syngo VIA workstation Case studies: A Siemens Dual Source CT scanner was utilised to accurately differentiate between iodine staining and/or haemorrhagic transformation in the case study patients that underwent clot retrieval. This is a robust method of differentiating between haemorrhage and/or iodine staining.

4767,"The inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced neuronal apoptosis via AMPKalpha1 signaling-mediated autophagy Purpose/Objective(s): In our previous study, we have found that minocycline, a clinical available antibiotics that can easily cross the blood brain barrier, mitigates radiation-induced long-term memory loss in rats, accompanied by decreased hippocampal neuron apoptosis shortly after radiation. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the detailed mechanisms underlying the protective effect of minocycline on neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis. Purpose/Objective(s): The immortalized mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cell line was used. The protective effect of minocycline on X-irradiated HT22 cells was demonstrated using clonogenic assay and apoptosis analysis. The underlying mechanisms were explored by using methods such as flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, shRNA knockdown, Western blot et al. Result(s): We found that minocycline protected HT22 hippocampal neurons from radiation-induced cell death, manifest as increased clonogenic cell survival and decreased apoptosis in irradiated cells. This protective effect of minocycline might involve cell cycle perturbation after radiation, but not DNA damage and repair. Further investigation showed that X-irradiation activated AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy, and minocycline significantly enhanced AMPKalpha1 activation and autophagy, resulting in decreased apoptosis. Additionally, the antioxidant potential of minocycline might not be involved in the enhancing effect of minocycline on radiation-induced autophagy, but it might at least partially contribute to the inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced apoptosis. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that minocycline protects neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis mainly through targeting radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy.",Included

When exposed to short photoperiod (SP), this primate demonstrates rapid changes in energy balance as adaptive anticipatory response for winter survival. To follow early changes induced by SP exposure, body mass, food intake, resting metabolism (RMR) and free thyroxin levels in plasma (T4) were measured in males abruptly transferred to SP: six intact males (controls), eight males that underwent bilateral olfactory removal (BOX) and eight males exposed to male urinary cues (U-exposed). To assess the effect of SP exposure, two other groups were maintained for 6 weeks under LP: six controls and six BOX males. Whereas all studied parameters remained constant in controls and BOX males maintained under LP, exposure to SP led to different responses according to groups. In controls, SP exposure led to a regular increase in body mass and after 4 weeks under SP, plasma T4 levels, food consumption and RMR significantly decreased. Even if BOX males demonstrated hyperphagic patterns regardless of the photoperiod, an increase in body mass was also induced by SP exposure but without changes in RMR or food intake that were body mass-dependent. In U-exposed males, body mass gain was significantly reduced while food intake and RMR remained high. In both BOX and U-exposed males, SP exposure led to a transient but high increase in T4 levels compared to controls. These results suggest that olfaction/olfactory cues may delay the SP-mediated changes in energy balance.",Excluded

4812,"Environmental damage to the retina and preconditioning: contrasting effects of light and hyperoxic stress PURPOSE: Environmental stress (bright light, hypoxia) can ""condition"" retinal photoreceptors, increasing their resistance to subsequent stress. The present study tests whether another photoreceptor-lethal stress, hyperoxia, can induce similar resistance.METHODS: Vulnerability to hyperoxia was tested in young adult C57BL/6J mice exposed to 1000 lux cyclic light for 1 week or to 50% O2 for 1 week and then to 75% O2 for 2 weeks. Vulnerability to light was tested in Balb/cJ mice exposed to 300 lux cyclic light for 2 days or to 75% O2 for 2 weeks and then to 1000 lux cyclic light for 1 week. Retinas were analyzed for photoreceptor death, levels of stress-related proteins (GFAP, FGF-2, MnSOD, acrolein), and the regulation of candidate neuroprotective genes (HSP70.1, Ledgf, FGF-13, Timp2).RESULTS: Light preconditioning did not cause measurable death of photoreceptors but reduced photoreceptor death induced by subsequent hyperoxic or light stress, reduced levels of stress-related proteins, and maintained the length and organization of photoreceptor outer segments. Hyperoxic preconditioning caused measurable cell death but provided no protection against subsequent hyperoxic or light stress. Of the four candidate neuroprotective proteins examined, the regulation of only one (Timp2) seemed associated with the neuroprotection observed.CONCLUSIONS: Light preconditioning, causing only minimal damage to photoreceptors, induced protection against subsequent stress from both hyperoxia and light. By contrast, hyperoxic preconditioning caused measurable photoreceptor damage but induced no protection against light or hyperoxia. These data suggest a separation between stress-induced damage to photoreceptors and the upregulation of protective mechanisms, encouraging the search for ways to protect the retina without damaging it.",Excluded
3878,"Nongynecologic Findings Seen at Pelvic US Ultrasonography (US) is frequently the first imaging modality used to examine women with symptoms involving the pelvis. It is widely available and involves no exposure to ionizing radiation. Images can be acquired with a transabdominal, endovaginal, or translabial approach, and the use of video clips and three-dimensional reconstructions can be helpful. US is excellent for assessment of the uterus, ovaries, and adnexa. Occasionally, nongynecologic pelvic diseases arising from the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal systems and the pelvic peritoneal and extraperitoneal spaces may be detected and can be a source of diagnostic dilemma. US can be helpful not only in the detection but also occasionally in the characterization of such entities. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are useful in complicated cases. In this article, the normal US appearance of the bowel and US signs of bowel disease and specific entities, including appendicitis, diverticular disease, bowel obstruction, appendiceal mucocele, and intestinal tumors, are reviewed. The lower urinary tract is included in the field of view in every pelvic US examination; commonly encountered entities related to the urinary bladder, distal ureter, and urethra are illustrated. In addition to arising in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, pathologic conditions in the pelvis can arise in the peritoneal or extraperitoneal space. Although conditions of the pelvic peritoneal and extraperitoneal spaces are rare, it is important to recognize these entities and distinguish them from the more common gynecologic diseases. Owing to the implications for diagnosis and management, radiologists and other physicians who perform pelvic US should be aware of the spectrum of nongynecologic pathologic entities that can be detected. <sup>©</sup>RSNA, 2017.",Excluded
3655,"Disuse Osteoporosis: Clinical and Mechanistic Insights Disuse osteoporosis describes a state of bone loss due to local skeletal unloading or systemic immobilization. This review will discuss advances in the field that have shed light on clinical observations, mechanistic insights and options for the treatment of disuse osteoporosis. Clinical settings of disuse osteoporosis include spinal cord injury, other neurological and neuromuscular disorders, immobilization after fractures and bed rest (real or modeled). Furthermore, spaceflight-induced bone loss represents a well-known adaptive process to microgravity. Clinical studies have outlined that immobilization leads to immediate bone loss in both the trabecular and cortical compartments accompanied by relatively increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation. The fact that the low bone formation state has been linked to high levels of the osteocyte-secreted protein sclerostin is one of the many findings that has brought matrix-embedded, mechanosensitive osteocytes into focus in the search for mechanistic principles. Previous basic research has primarily involved rodent models based on tail suspension, spaceflight and other immobilization methods, which have underlined the importance of osteocytes in the pathogenesis of disuse osteoporosis. Furthermore, molecular-based in vitro and in vivo approaches have revealed that osteocytes sense mechanical loading through mechanosensors that translate extracellular mechanical signals to intracellular biochemical signals and regulate gene expression. Osteocytic mechanosensors include the osteocyte cytoskeleton and dendritic processes within the lacuno-canalicular system (LCS), ion channels (e.g., Piezo1), extracellular matrix, primary cilia, focal adhesions (integrin-based) and hemichannels and gap junctions (connexin-based). Overall, disuse represents one of the major factors contributing to immediate bone loss and osteoporosis, and alterations in osteocytic pathways appear crucial to the bone loss associated with unloading.

4041,"First-in-human results of <sup>124</sup>i-CLR1404 PET/CT in primary and metastatic brain tumors Objectives: Radioembolization using Yttrium-90 (Y-90) microspheres is becoming a more widely utilized treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In recent years, it was found that a Y-90 PET scan can be acquired to determine the distribution of microspheres after their administration. While the obvious advantage of PET is better resolution than Bremsstrahlung imaging, the other great advantage of quantitative assessment is just beginning to be exploited. Method(s): In this retrospective study, 57 patients with HCC, which included 101 distinct tumors, were analyzed after Y-90 microsphere treatment in order to evaluate the dose of radiation delivered to liver tumors as well as to normal liver tissue. Using Y-90 PET/CT and triphasic liver CT scans in conjunction with commercially available imaging software, we were able to contour tumor and normal liver regions treated by Y-90 radioembolization and determine the specific activities (Bq/mL) for treated tumor and normal liver tissue. An absorbed dose factor, taking into account isotope branching ratios and decay was calculated through a phantom experiment. This factor was used to convert the specific activities (Bq/mL) of normal and malignant liver tissue to an absorbed dose (Gy). Result(s): The analysis suggests that the mean dose received among the 101 studied tumors was 166.45 Gy with a mode of 90-120 Gy and a treatment dose range of 0-570 Gy. Normal liver tissue in the 57 cases evaluated received a mean dose of 66.25 Gy with a mode of 60-70 Gy and a range of 10-120 Gy. Conclusion(s): This data demonstrates that the Y-90 dose to liver tumors after radioembolization is fairly similar to the brachytherapy dose used to treat other cancers. This also shows that the normal liver tissue may receive a dose which is nontrivial and have some real biological effects for the patient. This study is among the first to systematically showa method for quantitative dose assessment using Y-90 PET. These methods in the future can provide the tools to help understand whether patient adverse events, treatment success, or treatment failure can be attributed to the dose which the tumor or normal liver received.",Excluded
4339,"Non-coplanar volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for craniopharyngiomas reduces radiation doses to the bilateral hippocampus: a planning study comparing dynamic conformal arc therapy, coplanar VMAT, and non-coplanar VMAT BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that radiation-induced injuries to the hippocampus play important roles in compromising neurocognitive functioning for patients with brain tumors and it could be important to spare the hippocampus using modern planning methods for patients with craniopharyngiomas. As bilateral hippocampus are located on the same level as the planning target volume (PTV) in patients with craniopharyngioma, it seems possible to reduce doses to hippocampus using non-coplanar beams. While the use of non-coplanar beams in volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) of malignant intracranial tumors has recently been reported, no dosimetric comparison has yet been made between VMAT using non-coplanar arcs (ncVMAT) and VMAT employing only coplanar arcs (coVMAT) among patients with craniopharyngiomas. We performed a planning study comparing dose distributions to the PTV, hippocampus, and other organs at risk (OAR) of dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCAT), coVMAT, and ncVMAT.METHODS: DCAT, coVMAT, and ncVMAT plans were created for 10 patients with craniopharyngiomas. The prescription dose was 52.2 Gy in 29 fractions, and 99 % of each PTV was covered by 90 % of the prescribed dose. The maximum dose was held below 107 % of the prescribed dose. CoVMAT and ncVMAT plans were formulated to satisfy the following criteria: the doses to the hippocampus were minimized, and the doses to the OAR were similar to or lower than those of DCAT.RESULTS: The mean equivalent doses in 2-Gy fractions to 40 % of the volumes of the bilateral hippocampus [EQD2(40%hippos)] were 15.4/10.8/6.5 Gy for DCAT/coVMAT/ncVMAT, respectively. The EQD2(40%hippos) for ncVMAT were <7.3 Gy, which is the threshold predicting cognitive impairment, as defined by Gondi et al.. The mean doses to normal brain tissue and the conformity indices were similar for the three plans, and the homogeneity indices were significantly better for coVMAT and ncVMAT compared with DCAT.CONCLUSIONS: NcVMAT is more appropriate than DCAT and coVMAT for patients with craniopharyngiomas. NcVMAT significantly reduces radiation doses to the bilateral hippocampus (to 50 % that of the DCAT) without increasing the doses to normal brain tissue and other OAR.",Excluded
4479,"The effect of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy on time to change of systemic therapy in extra-cranial renal cell carcinoma metastases Background: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has traditionally been refractory to radiotherapy with conventional fractionation, although recent evidence suggests a response to higher doses per fraction. We evaluated local control of extra-cranial metastases from RCC treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). Method(s): RCC patients with extracranial metastases treated with SABR were retrospectively enrolled from a single institution between 2005 and 2015. A total of 188 lesions were identified from 91 patients. Radiation (8-60Gy) was delivered in 1-5 fractions (fx) using stereotactic guidance. Local control (LC) was determined by imaging according to RECIST 1.1. Result(s): Median age at the time of treatment was 62.4 years. Metastases were detected in bone (39.9%), lung (14.9%), liver (9.6%), lymph nodes (11.7%) and other sites (23.9%). Ninety-seven (51.6%) lesions reached curative intent while 91 (48.4%) only reached palliative intent. The most common radiation regimens were 20Gy/1fx, 30Gy/3fx, and 40Gy/5fx. One-year overall survival was 76.5% with a median follow up of 10.7 months. Patients treated with curative SABR showed a 2-fold median survival as compared to those treated with palliative therapy (3.97 year vs 1.43 year, p<0.05). LC rates at 1 and 2 years were 91.4% and 89.7%, respectively. For the patients that failed, median time to local failure was 6.6 months. LC at 1 year significantly improved when treatment was curative (96.1% vs 84.9%, p<0.05), while it decreased in a re-irradiation setting (94.8% vs 46.7%, p<0.05). The median biological equivalent dose (BED) for the lesions that failed was 103Gy, corresponding to 6Gy x 5fx, and was significantly lowered compared to controlled lesions (BED 134Gy). Although 79% of patients developed new lesions within 1 year following SABR, 34.8% did not switch systemic therapy. Switching systemic therapy was delayed in patients treated with curative as compared to palliative SABR (13.4 vs 2.5 months, p<0.05). Conclusion(s): SABR improved LC of extra-cranial RCC metastases and delayed change to systemic therapy. SABR may complement systemic therapy to improve outcome in the present patient population.",Excluded
3982,"Cancer pain (classification and pain syndromes) Inspite the new informations about the physiology and biochemistry of pain, it remains true that pain is only partially understood. Cancer pain is often experienced as several different types of pain, with combined somatic and neuropathic types the most frequently. If the acute cancer pain does not subside with initial therapy, patients experience pain of more constant nature, the characteristics of wich vary with the cause and the involved sites. Chronic pain related to cancer can be considered as tumor-induced pain, chemotherapy-induced pain, and radiation therapy-induced pain. Certain pain mechanisms are present in cancer patients. These include inflammation due to infection, such as local sepsis or the pain of herpes zoster, and pain due to the obstruction or occlusion of a hollow organ, such as that caused by large bowel in cancer of colon. Pain also is commonly due to destruction of tissue, such as is often seen with bony metastases. Bony metastases also produce pain because of periostal irritation, medullary pressure, and fractures. Pain may be produced by the growth of tumor in a closed area richly supplied with pain receptors (nociceptors). Examples are tumors growing within the capsule of an organ such as the pancreas. Chest pain occurring after tumor of the lung or the mediastinum due to invasion of the pleura. Certain tumors produce characteristic types of pain. For example, back pain is seen with multiple myeloma, and severe shoulder pain and arm pain is seen with Pancoast tumors. [References: 42]",Excluded
4320,"Preconditioning-induced protection of photoreceptors requires activation of the signal-transducing receptor gp130 in photoreceptors Retinal degenerations are a class of neurodegenerative disorders that ultimately lead to blindness due to the death of retinal photoreceptors. In most cases, death is the result of long-term exposure to environmental, inflammatory, and genetic insults. In age-related macular degeneration, significant vision loss may take up to 70-80 years to develop. The protracted time to develop blindness suggests that retinal neurons have an endogenous mechanism for protection from chronic injury. Previous studies have shown that endogenous protective mechanisms can be induced by preconditioning animals with sublethal bright cyclic light. Such preconditioning can protect photoreceptors from a subsequent damaging insult and is thought to be accomplished through induced expression of protective factors. Some of the factors shown to be associated with protection bind and activate the signal transducing receptor gp130. To determine whether stress-induced endogenous protection of photoreceptors requires gp130, we generated conditional gp130 knockout (KO) mice with the Cre/lox system and used light-preconditioning to induce neuroprotection in these mice. Functional and morphological analyses demonstrated that the retina-specific gp130 KO impaired preconditioning-induced endogenous protection. Photoreceptor-specific gp130 KO mice had reduced protection, although the Muller cell KO mice did not, thus gp130-induced protection was restricted to photoreceptors. Using an animal model of retinitis pigmentosa, we found that the photoreceptor-specific gp130 KO increased sensitivity to genetically induced photoreceptor cell death, demonstrating that gp130 activation in photoreceptors had a general protective role independent of whether stress was caused by light or genetic mutations.",Excluded

4455,"Evidence that tRNA synthetase-directed proton transfer stops mistranslation To prevent mistranslation, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) discriminate against noncognate amino acids and cellular metabolites. Defects in specificity produce statistical proteins which, in mammalian cells, lead to activation of the unfolded protein response and cell death. Because of inherent limitations in amino acid discrimination by a single active site, AARSs evolved a separate domain to clear mischarged amino acids. Although the structure of a widely distributed editing domain for ThrRS and AlaRS is known, the mechanism of amino acid clearance remains elusive. This domain has two motifs that together have four conserved residues in the pocket used to clear serine from mischarged tRNAs. Here, using ThrRS as an example, rapid single-turnover kinetics, mutagenesis, and solvent isotope analysis show that a strictly conserved histidine (between ThrRS and AlaRS) extracts a proton in the chemical step of the editing reaction. Three other conserved residues, and two additional residues in the editing pocket, are not directly implicated in the chemical step. These results are relevant to the previously reported mutagenesis of the homologous editing pocket of alanyl-tRNA synthetase, where even a mild defect in editing causes neurodegeneration in the mouse. Thus, a single proton-transfer event needed to prevent mistranslation can have profound implications for disease.",Excluded
3656,"Technology insight: Image-guided robotic radiosurgery - A new approach for noninvasive ablation of spinal lesions The need for an effective noninvasive tool to ablate spinal lesions reflects the limitations of traditional surgical and radiotherapeutic approaches. Open surgery is invasive and carries a risk of neurological injury and vertebral column dysfunction. Conventional radiotherapy often has poor clinical efficacy and a risk of neurologic complications. Spinal radiosurgery has been developed to overcome these limitations. This technique consists of precise delivery of high-dose radiation to a spinal target. To spare the delicate and radiation-sensitive spinal cord and to avoid potentially devastating neurological complications, it is essential that the radiation dose decreases rapidly outside of the target. This is accomplished by use of advanced, image-guidance technology, treatment planning software, and robotics. Preliminary data indicate that this approach can achieve high rates of tumor control of spinal and paraspinal lesions and durable reduction of associated vertebral pain without neurological complications. Although spinal radiosurgery is not yet widely practiced, the benefits of this new therapeutic approach are likely to encourage its widespread adoption in coming years.",Excluded
3782,"A strong constant magnetic field affects muscle tension development in bullfrog neuromuscular preparations Effects of a constant magnetic field (CMF) of 0.65 T on muscle tension over 9 h were studied in the neuromuscular preparation of the bullfrog sartorius muscle. Tension was developed every 30 min by stimulation of the sciatic nerve (nerve stimulation) or of the sartorius muscle itself (muscle stimulation). In sciatic nerve stimulation, tension decreased rapidly for the first 3-4 h at a similar rate in both test (exposed to CMF) and control muscles. However, the rate of decrease became smaller and almost leveled off after 3-4 h in the test muscles, whereas tension continued to decrease monotonically in control muscles. The slope of the decrease for these later periods was significantly different between the test and the control conditions. Accordingly, tension was larger in test than in control muscles. In muscle stimulation, tension decreased monotonically from the start of experiments in control muscles, while tension in test muscles maintained their initial values for almost 3 h. Thereafter they started to decrease with a similar rate to the control. Hence, tension was always larger in test than in control muscles. A similar pattern of temporal change was observed for the rate of rise of the maximum tension for nerve or muscle stimulation. However, a significant difference was detected only in the case of muscle stimulation. The present results showed that a strong CMF of 0.65 T had biological effects on tension development of the bullfrog sartorius muscle by stimulation of the sciatic nerve as well as by stimulation of muscle itself. The presence of a small AC magnetic field component leaves open the possibility of an AC, rather than a CMF effect. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded

First, previous in vitro data for the swelling of cultured neurons (N18; rat neuroblastoma) and astroglia (C6; rat astroglyoma) upon exposure to a hypoosmotic solution were reappraised. Neurons swelled rapidly, forming blisters, and easily burst. whereas astroglia resisted swelling and slowly assumed a large full-moon shape. The time constant of swelling was 35.2 +/- 7.8 s for N18 and 594.8 +/- 554.0 s for C6. The glial plasmic membrane was found to be much stronger than the neuronal one, presumably due to a well-developed cytoskeleton. To overcome such neuronal membranous weakness, strong astroglial processes need to cover the neurons including the cell body and synapses, as demonstrated electron-microscopically. Next, in situ astroglial swelling was investigated in rats. During K(+)-induced cortical spreading depression, increases or decreases of a wave-ring spread of light (550 nm) transmission through a 1 mm-thick cerebral cortical layer was observed. The moving local optical density decrease in the cortex was attributable to local vascular bed compression induced by astroglial swelling, since concomitant occurrence of colocated dynamic capillary flow stall was confirmed by a hemodilution technique.

4055,"Modulations of nerve growth factor and Bcl-2 in ultraviolet-irradiated human epidermis BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation to the skin causes apoptosis of keratinocytes. Melanocytes are more resistant to UV-induced apoptosis, due, in part, to high levels of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2. In vitro studies have shown that nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophic polypeptide, is produced by keratinocytes and exerts a protective role for melanocytes by upregulating Bcl-2. The purpose of this study was to determine NGF and Bcl-2 modulations in UV-irradiated human skin.METHODS: Nine volunteers were irradiated with two minimal erythema doses using solar-simulated UV irradiation. Seventy-two hours post irradiation, skin biopsies were obtained from irradiated and sun-protected skin. The skin specimens were stained with anti-tyrosinase-related protein-1 monoclonal antibody IgG2a (Mel-5), anti-Bcl-2 (monoclonal antibody IgG-kappa), and with anti-NGF (polyclonal antibody IgG).RESULTS: NGF staining was identified within the cytoplasm of epidermal melanocytes, similar to the staining observed for TRP-1 and Bcl-2. While no significant difference in the number of TRP-1- and Bcl-2-positive melanocytes was observed between irradiated and non-irradiated skin within 72 h, the number of NGF-positive melanocytes decreased significantly, 72 h after UV irradiation (p < 0.024). NGF was also identified within keratinocytes, and while non-irradiated skin exhibited cytoplasmic NGF staining throughout the epidermis, NGF staining was reduced in the lower epidermal layers after UV irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first in vivo study showing NGF to be present in melanocytes, as well as showing modulations of NGF and Bcl-2 in melanocytes, following solar-simulated UV irradiation.",Excluded

Within a trial comparing adjuvant radiotherapy versus active monitoring following surgical resection for an atypical meningioma (ROAM/EORTC-1308), we explored patterns in communication and reasons why health practitioners may find it challenging to convey equipoise and explore treatment preferences. Material(s) and Method(s): Qualitative study embedded within ROAM/EORTC-1308. Data were collected on 40 patients and 18 practitioners from 13 U.K. sites, including audio recordings of 39 patients' trial consultations, 23 patient interviews, and 18 practitioner interviews. Qualitative analysis drew on argumentation theory. Result(s): Practitioners acknowledged the importance of the research question that the trial aimed to answer. However, they often demonstrated a lack of equipoise in consultations, particularly with eligible patients who practitioners believed to be susceptible to side effects (e.g., cognitive impairment) or inconvenienced by radiotherapy. Practitioners elicited but rarely explored patient treatment preferences, especially if a patient expressed an initial preference for active monitoring. Concerns about coercing patients, loss of practitioner agency, and time constraints influenced communication in ways that were loaded against trial participation. Conclusion(s): We identified several challenges that practitioners face in conveying equipoise and exploring patient treatment preferences in oncology, and particularly neuro-oncology, trials with distinct management pathways. The findings informed communication about ROAM/EORTC-1308 and will be relevant to enhancing trial communication in future oncology trials. Qualitative studies embedded within trials can address difficulties with communication, thus improving informed consent and recruitment. ROAM/EORTC-1308 RCT: ISRCTN71502099. Implications for Practice: Oncology trials can be challenging to recruit to, especially those that compare treatment versus monitoring. Conveying clinical equipoise and exploring patient treatment preferences can enhance recruitment and patient understanding. This study focused on the challenges that practitioners encounter in trying to use such communication strategies and how practitioners may inadvertently impede patient recruitment and informed decision making. This article provides recommendations to support practitioners in balancing the content and presentation of trial management pathways. The results can inform training to optimize communication, especially for neuro-oncology trials and trials comparing markedly different management pathways. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

3909,"Dynamics of mouse rod phototransduction and its sensitivity to variation of key parameters The deep understanding of the biochemical and biophysical basis of visual transduction, makes it ideal for systems-level analysis. A sensitivity analysis is presented for a self-consistent set of parameters involved in mouse phototransduction. The organising framework is a spatio-temporal mathematical model, which includes the geometry of the rod outer segment (ROS), the layered array of the discs, the incisures, the biochemistry of the activation/deactivation cascade and the biophysics of the diffusion of the second messengers in the cytoplasm and the closing of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) gated cationic channels. These modules include essentially all the relevant geometrical, biochemical and biophysical parameters. The parameters are selected from within experimental ranges, to obey basic first principles such as conservation of mass and energy fluxes. By means of the model they are compared to a large set of experimental data, providing a strikingly close match. Following isomerisation of a single rhodopsin R * (single photon response), the sensitivity analysis was carried out on the photo-response, measured both in terms of number of effector molecules produced, and photocurrent suppression, at peak time and the activation and recovery phases of the cascade. The current suppression is found to be very sensitive to variations of the catalytic activities, Hill's coefficients and hydrolysis rates and the geometry of the ROS, including size and shape of the incisures. The activated effector phosphodiesterase (PDE *) is very sensitive to variations of catalytic activity of G-protein activation and the average lifetimes of activated rhodopsin R * and PDE *; however, they are insensitive to geometry and variations of the transduction parameters. Thus the system is separated into two functional modules, activation/deactivation and transduction, each confined in different geometrical domains, communicating through the hydrolysis of cGMP by PDE *, and each sensitive to variations of parameters only in its own module.",Excluded
4811,"Auditory efferent feedback system deficits precede age-related hearing loss: contralateral suppression of otoacoustic emissions in mice The C57BL/6J mouse has been a useful model of presbycusis, as it displays an accelerated age-related peripheral hearing loss. The medial olivocochlear efferent feedback (MOC) system plays a role in suppressing cochlear outer hair cell (OHC) responses, particularly for background noise. Neurons of the MOC system are located in the superior olivary complex, particularly in the dorsomedial periolivary nucleus (DMPO) and in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB). We previously discovered that the function of the MOC system declines with age prior to OHC degeneration, as measured by contralateral suppression (CS) of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in humans and CBA mice. The present study aimed to determine the time course of age changes in MOC function in C57s. DPOAE amplitudes and CS of DPOAEs were collected for C57s from 6 to 40 weeks of age. MOC responses were observed at 6 weeks but were gone at middle (15-30 kHz) and high (30-45 kHz) frequencies by 8 weeks. Quantitative stereological analyses of Nissl sections revealed smaller neurons in the DMPO and VNTB of young adult C57s compared with CBAs. These findings suggest that reduced neuron size may underlie part of the noteworthy rapid decline of the C57 efferent system. In conclusion, the C57 mouse has MOC function at 6 weeks, but it declines quickly, preceding the progression of peripheral age-related sensitivity deficits and hearing loss in this mouse strain.",Excluded
4635,"Distinct inhibition of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels by delta-opioid agonists in dorsal root ganglion neurons devoid of functional T-type Ca2+ currents Both mu- and delta-opioid agonists selectively inhibit nociception but have little effect on other sensory modalities. Voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels in the primary sensory neurons are important for the regulation of nociceptive transmission. In this study, we determined the effect of delta-opioid agonists on voltage-activated Ca(2+) channel currents (I(Ca)) in small-diameter rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons that do and do not bind isolectin B(4) (IB(4)). The delta-opioid agonists [d-Pen(2),d-Pen(5)]-enkephalin (DPDPE) and deltorphin II produced a greater inhibition of high voltage-activated I(Ca) in IB(4)-negative than IB(4)-positive neurons. Furthermore, DPDPE produced a greater inhibition of N-, P/Q-, and L-type I(Ca) in IB(4)-negative than IB(4)-positive neurons. However, DPDPE had no significant effect on the R-type I(Ca) in either type of cells. We were surprised to find that DPDPE failed to inhibit either the T-type or high voltage-activated I(Ca) in all the DRG neurons with T-type I(Ca). Double immunofluorescence labeling showed that the majority of the delta-opioid receptor-immunoreactive DRG neurons had IB(4) labeling, while all DRG neurons immunoreactive to delta-opioid receptors exhibited Cav(3.2) immunoreactivity. Additionally, DPDPE significantly inhibited high voltage-activated I(Ca) in Tyrode's or N-methyl-d-glucamine solution but not in tetraethylammonium solution. This study provides new information that delta-opioid agonists have a distinct effect on voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels in different phenotypes of primary sensory neurons. High voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels are more sensitive to inhibition by delta-opioid agonists in IB(4)-negative than IB(4)-positive neurons, and this opioid effect is restricted to DRG neurons devoid of functional T-type Ca(2+) currents.",Excluded
4285,"[Virtual reality in neurosurgery] DEFINITION: Virtual reality enables users to immerse themselves in a virtual three-dimensional world and to interact in this world. The simulation is different from the kind in computer games, in which the viewer is active but acts in a nonrealistic world, or on the TV screen, where we are passively driven in an active world. In virtual reality elements look realistic, they change their characteristics and have almost real-world unpredictability.USE OF VIRTUAL REALITY: Virtual reality is not only implemented in gambling dens and the entertainment industry but also in manufacturing processes (cars, furniture etc.), military applications and medicine. Especially the last two areas are strongly correlated, because telemedicine or telesurgery was originated for military reasons to operate on war victims from a secure distance or to perform surgery on astronauts in an orbiting space station. In medicine and especially neurosurgery virtual-reality methods are used for education, surgical planning and simulation on a virtual patient. [References: 33]",Excluded
3773,"Emerging treatments and gene expression profiling in high-risk medulloblastoma The past decades have seen an increase in the survival rates of patients with standard-risk medulloblastoma. Efforts have, therefore, been focused on obtaining better results in the treatment of patients with high-risk tumors. In addition to consolidated therapies, novel approaches such as small molecules, monoclonal antibodies, and antiangiogenic therapies that aim to improve outcomes and quality of life are now available through new breakthroughs in the molecular biology of medulloblastoma. The advent of innovative anticancer drugs tested in brain tumors has important consequences for personalized therapy. Gene expression profiling of medulloblastoma can be used to identify the genes and signaling transduction pathways that are crucial for the tumorigenesis process, thereby revealing both new targets for therapy and sensitive/resistance phenotypes. The interpretation of microarray data for new treatments of patients with high-risk medulloblastoma, as well as other poor prognosis tumors, should be developed through a consensus multidisciplinary approach involving oncologists, neurosurgeons, radiotherapists, biotechnologists, bioinformaticists, and other professionals. © 2007 Adis Data Information BV.

3842,"High resolution dual-tracer brain SPECT with a new highperformance CdTe detector Aims: Simultaneous dual-tracer brain imaging has the potential to shorten patient pathways in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, but the poor spectral resolution of conventional gamma cameras limits the utility of this technique. Solid state detectors offer improved capability to distinguish between two radioisotopes, and this has been exploited clinically in the field of nuclear cardiology. However, the technology has yet to be fully evaluated in the field of scintigraphic neuroimaging. We present imaging results for a new small-pixel CdTe detector in simultaneous dual-radioisotope scintigraphy of a brain phantom. Method(s): We have developed a new high-performance CdTe detector with an array of 80x80 pixels on a 250mum pitch, capable of imaging x-rays and gamma rays up to 200keV. The detector is fully spectroscopic, recording the energy of every interaction in each pixel of the detector, and the small pixel size affords very high spatial- and spectral- resolution. The detector has a wide range of applications in medical imaging, including x-ray diffraction tomography, x-ray k-edge subtraction and highresolution nuclear medicine imaging. The new detector has been characterised for radionuclide imaging. Using pinhole collimation, images have been acquired of a brain phantom containing both I-123 and Tc-99m. The hyperspectral dataset was subjected to corrections for inter-pixel charge sharing, variations in energy and uniformity response, and bad pixel interpolation. Images were created by applying energy windows to the spectral data. Images and spectra of the same phantom were also acquired with a conventional clinical gamma camera for comparison. For each image, the contrast and cross-talk between the two energy windows were quantified using regions of interest. Result(s): The CdTe system exhibits improved scatter rejection and greatly reduced cross-talk between the energy windows for the two radioisotopes, resulting in enhanced image contrast. These characteristics will allow for better accuracy for quantitative imaging in a dual-tracer setting, which has particular importance in brain imaging. We also demonstrate the ability of the detector to resolve low-energy fluorescence x-rays from the radioactive source. The system has a high efficiency for detection of these low-energy photons, and incorporating these events into image reconstruction may boost the sensitivity, reducing image noise. Conclusion(s): Small-pixel CdTe detectors are a promising prospect in multi-tracer SPECT imaging. We present future plans to develop the instrument, with a tiled array of detectors with minimal dead-space to increase the field of view and improved collimators to further increase the sensitivity of the system.",Excluded
4227,"Superior colliculus responses to light - preserved by transplantation in a slow degeneration rat model PURPOSE: To determine whether retinal transplantation can preserve visual responses in the superior colliculus (SC) of the S334ter-line-5 rat, a transgenic model for slow photoreceptor degeneration, which is more similar to human retinitis pigmentosa than the fast degeneration line 3 S334ter rat.METHODS: Visual responses to a light flash were recorded in the SC. Rats that had received embryonic day (E) 19-20 fetal retinal sheet transplants at the age of 26-30 days were tested at the ages of 200-254 days. Controls were age-matched rats without surgery and with sham surgery. As a baseline, in no-surgery line-5 rats, the temporal pattern of visual sensitivity loss was evaluated electrophysiologically in the SC from 60 days up to one year of age.RESULTS: In untreated S334ter-line-5 rats, decline in visual sensitivity in the SC was parallel to the photoreceptor loss. At 109 day of age, a relative scotoma developed in the area of the SC corresponding to the nasal retinal region. At 200-254 days of age, the majority of the SC was devoid of any light-driven responses. In contrast, at this time point, transplanted rats with 'good' retinal grafts with normal lamination had visual responses in the caudal region of the SC, the area corresponding topographically to the transplant location in the retina. In these rats, the various parameters of SC responses such as the latency of the onset of the visual response, the response peak amplitude and the consistency of the visual response were significantly different from the control groups (no-surgery, sham surgery, 'poor' transplants) and were more comparable to normal albino rats, however, with a slightly longer latency (70-90 vs. 30-50 msec).CONCLUSIONS: Fetal retinal sheet transplantation showed a long-term rescue effect on visual function in this animal model of slow photoreceptor degeneration.",Excluded
4001,"Light delays synaptic deafferentation and potentiates the survival of axotomized retinal ganglion cells Knowledge of the cellular mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of stimulation and the optimal doses of such stimulation to maximize neuronal recovery is essential to guide clinical practice in neural rehabilitation. Using hamsters, we transected the optic nerve to demonstrate how light stimulation affects neuronal recovery. The c-fos protein was used as a neuronal connectivity marker. Here we show that: (a) in addition to cell death, a population of cells undergoes synaptic deafferentation and (b) light stimulation delays cell death and deafferentation. Among the three rearing conditions studied (6:18LD, 12:12LD, and 18:6LD), the 12:12LD condition appears to be the one achieving the optimal therapeutic effect.

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil (TPF) chemotherapy was administered. The prescribed dose was 66-70.4 Gy to the GTV_P while maintaining all the critical neurologic organs within dose constraints.Results: The local response rate was 88.6% after induction chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 48.5 months, the 3-year local failure-free survival (LFFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 92.4% and 89.6%, respectively. The average Dmin to the GTV_P was 59.4 Gy (range, 48.3-70.4 Gy). Additionally, 54.0 Gy was identified as the optimal cut-off Dmin to the GTV_P, and the Dmin >=54.0 Gy group had a better local complete response rate after IMRT (52.4% vs. 81.3%, chi2 = 7.335, P = 0.007), a better 3-year LFFS (95.9% vs. 78.4%, P = 0.005) and a better OS (93.3% vs. 75.9%, P = 0.003). Furthermore, a multivariate analysis found the Dmin to the GTV_P >=54.0 Gy to be prognostically important for LFFS and OS. One patient (1%) developed asymptomatic temporal lobe necrosis, but no other neurological dysfunctions were observed.Conclusions: For T3-4-stage NPC treated with IMRT plus TPF chemotherapy, excellent local control with few late toxicities was achieved. A Dmin >=54.0 Gy to the GTV_P may confer better local control. New ways to increase the Dmin to the GTV_P as far as possible without increasing late toxicities are urgently required.",Excluded
3745,"Effect of hindlimb unloading on stereological parameters of the motor cortex and hippocampus in male rats Hindlimb unloading (HU) can cause motion and cognition dysfunction, although its cellular and molecular mechanisms are not well understood. The aim of the present study was to determine the stereological parameters of the brain areas involved in motion (motor cortex) and spatial learning - memory (hippocampus) under an HU condition. Sixteen adult male rats, kept under a 12: 12 h light-dark cycle, were divided into two groups of freely moving (n=8) and HU (n=8) rats. The volume of motor cortex and hippocampus, the numerical cell density of neurons in layers I, II-III, V, and VI of the motor cortex, the entire motor cortex as well as the primary motor cortex, and the numerical density of the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus subregions of the hippocampus were estimated. No significant differences were observed in the evaluated parameters. Our results thus indicated that motor cortical and hippocampal atrophy and cell loss may not necessarily be involved in the motion and spatial learning memory impairment in the rat.

3867,"Predictors of trigeminal neuropathy after radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas Purpose To analyze the relationship between dosimetric characteristics and symptoms related to trigeminal neuropathy (TN) observed after radiosurgery (RS) for vestibular schwannomas (VS); to propose guidelines to optimize planification in VS RS regarding TN preservation; and to detail the mechanism of TN impairment after VS RS. Methods and Materials One hundred seventy-nine patients treated between 2011 and 2013 for VS RS and without trigeminal impairment before RS were included in a retrospective study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine predictors of TN among characteristics of the patients, the dosimetry, and the VS. Results There were 20 Koos grade 1, 99 grade 2, 57 grade 3, and 3 grade 4. Fourteen patients (7.8%) presented a transitory or permanent TN. Between the patients with and without TN after VS RS, there was no significant difference regarding dosimetry or VS volume itself. Significant differences (univariate analysis P<.05, Mann-Whitney test) were found for parameters related to the cisternal portion of the trigeminal nerve: total integrated dose, maximum dose, mean dose, volume of the Vth nerve (Vol<inf>v</inf>), and volume of the Vth nerve receiving at least 11 Gy (Vol<inf>Vcist>11Gy</inf>), but also for maximal dose to the Vth nerve nucleus and intra-axial portion (Dose max<inf>Vax</inf>). After multivariate analysis, the best model predicting TN included Vol<inf>Vcist>11Gy</inf> (P=.0045), Dose max<inf>Vax</inf> (P=.0006), and Vol<inf>v</inf> (P=.0058).

To study the characteristics of EEG after transient ischemic attack and to offer reference for screening procedure of aircrew and astronaut selection. Method. The dominant frequency uncertainty of alpha band EEG in 12 pilots (males; age 30 +/- 5) with transient ischemic episodes in middle cerebral artery (MCA) territories and in 20 normal healthy pilots was analyzed with frequency-fluctuation analysis. Result. The dominant probability of the main frequency coinciding with sites affected by transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patient pilots was higher than that in healthy pilots (P<0.01), and the dominant probability ratio logarithmic index I >or= 0 in all patient pilots with normal EEG, but I<0 in all healthy pilots. It was also found that not only I >or= 0, but the second component shifted to lower frequency (8 Hz) in patients with slight focal EEG alterations, i.e. slowing of frequency. The relative entropy values (percentage) were decreased significantly in pilots with TIA as compared with healthy pilots (P<0.05). Conclusion . The dominant frequency uncertainty analysis of alpha band showed clear superiority of computerized evaluation over routine visual assessment for the diagnosis of minor cerebral ischemia.

Changes in the morphological structure, cell viability, apoptosis rate, and expression of apoptosis-related protein induced by exposure to a power frequency electromagnetic field (PF-MF; 50 Hz, 100 muT, 24 h) were detected respectively by light and electron microscopy, the MTT assay, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The results showed that 3-12 h after PF-MF exposure, the pathological injury was improved partly; metabolic activity was promoted and cell apoptosis was inhibited in the AD neuronal model. In addition, PF-MF exposure significantly inhibited the expression of Caspase8, Caspase3, and CytC, but increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio of the AD neuronal model. Meanwhile, PF-MF seemed to have no effect on the expression of Fas and TNFR1.

3940,"Radiosurgical Lesionectomy For Cavernomas Associated With Drug Resistant Epilepsy Purpose/Objective(s): Cavernous malformations (CMs) are congenital vascular malformations of the brain which cause hemorrhage and repetitive neurological deficits but the most frequent presenting symptom is epilepsy and is due to deposition of iron and blood products at the margin of the lesion. Microsurgical excision is preferred for cortical-subcortical epileptogenic CMs that are not located in functional cortex. For patients presenting with seizures arising from eloquent cortex surrounding the lesion, radiosurgery appears to be a suitable alternative. We evaluated the effectiveness of SRS in seizure cessation for drug-resistant seizures associated with CMs. Materials/Methods: This retrospective single center study where in 11 patients with cortical or subcortical CMs located in highly functional areas with severe long-term drug-resistant epilepsy underwent radiosurgery. The mean duration of epilepsy before these SRS procedures was 6yrs (+/-2.4) years. The mean frequency of seizures was 5 /month (+/-12). The mean marginal radiation dose was 18.5 Gy. Result(s): At median follow-up of 38mo, 54% were seizure free (Engel's class I), including 5 in class IA and 1 of the patients with occasional auras. A highly significant decrease in the number of seizures was achieved for 27% pts (class IIB). The remaining 19% patients showed little or no improvement. Outcomes were better for patients with simple partial seizures than for those with complex partial seizures. Location in the mesio-temporal region was associated with a poor outcome (2 of 11 patients), whereas location in the latero-temporal region was associated with a good outcome (5 of 11 patients). Location in the central region was also associated with an excellent outcome. Radiologically, 6 patients presented major reactional edema during the first year after SRS. In 2 of these patients, neuroradiological alterations were associated with clinical manifestations which included severe hemiparesis and speech impairment, but both patients fully recovered during the follow-up period with steroids. Post reactional edema correlates well with the response to the therapy. Conclusion(s): While radiosurgery role in controlling the bleeding in CM is controversial, it is a promising modality for epilepsy associated with CMs. The determination of the extent of the epileptogenic zone in CMs and dose selection are the critical steps towards successful radiosurgical outcome.

3848,"An unusual and terminal cause of syncope LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: To recognize that aggressive orophyrangeal squamous cell cancer can lead to syncope LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: To appreciate a clinical scenario in which evaluation of carotid arteries is an appropriate part of syncope work up CASE: 63 year old male with history of locally advanced ((T4 - deep muscle invasion, N2b - multiple ipsilateral neck lymph nodes, M0), left sided base of tongue squamous cell cancer presented to the emergency room with multiple episodes syncope over 2-3 weeks. He was treated with chemoradiation 6 months prior to current admission. Follow up imaging after chemoradiation showed progressive disease. He was then started on palliative cetuximab 1 month prior to current admission. During current admission, work up for syncope was commenced. EKG and cardiac enzymes were negative. There were no events on telemetry. Review of his last CT scan from 4 months prior to admission showed encasement of left carotid artery. A repeat CT scan of his neck was performed. It showed remarkable tumor progression with extensive lymphadenopathy and compression of both of his carotid arteries by a combination of tumor burden, lymph nodes and post-radiation edema. Surgical resection of the mass and local radiation therapy were both deemed inappropriate due to location of tumor and its relative radioresistance in the past. In addition, there was concern that radiation could cause worsening edema and precipitous worsening of patient's condition by causing complete occlusion of the carotid arteries. This information was discussed with patient and his wife and he is currently in home hospice. In the 2 weeks since discharge, he feels he has been able to minimize further episodes of syncope by limiting and modifying his activities. DISCUSSION: Recurrent syncope due to malignancy is uncommon. Head and neck cancer can lead to recurrent syncope by two mechanisms. Neurally mediated syncope can occur due to carotid body invasion or involvement of the vagus nerve. Syncope due to reduced blood flow in carotid arteries is uncommon and requires involvement of both carotids. While it is possible that our patient was passing out due to tumor pressure mediated firing of baroreceptors in his carotid bodies, we think reduced carotid blood flow was the more likely culprit. This is based upon the fact that he only started having syncopal events after involvement of his contralateral carotid artery. Finally, our case highlights the importance of imaging the carotid arteries in patients with history of head and neck cancer who present with syncope. Imaging of carotid arteries is not merited during routine diagnostic work up of syncope unless a neurological event is suggested by history or if focal signs and symptoms are present. However, such an evaluation should be considered in patients who have a history of head and neck cancer, especially if the cancer has been relatively resistant to treatment or locally advanced in the past.",Excluded

4262,"Contrast or bleed? Using dual energy for differentiation in post-thrombectomy patients Neurological thrombectomy cases require a 24-h post-procedural unenhanced CT head scan to look for haemorrhagic transformation within the infarct. High attenuation signal can frequently be seen on unenhanced CT in these patients within the core infarct and is impossible to differentiate between iodine staining or haemorrhagic transformation. Evaluation of these images has always been subjective with no true diagnosis. Dual energy CT is an established imaging modality in differentiation of iodine and haemorrhage in high density lesions, post-clot retrieval or after contrast administration.1 Dual energy CT involves acquiring two simultaneous attenuation datasets at a high and low kV. The ratio of the difference in Hounsfield units in these two datasets gives us the ability to accurately differentiate different tissues. Utilising three material decomposition and iodine maps, virtual non-contrast images are created on the Syngo VIA workstation.2 A Siemens Dual Source CT scanner was utilised to accurately differentiate between iodine staining and/or haemorrhagic transformation in patients that underwent clot retrieval (see Figure). This is a robust method of differentiating between haemorrhage and/or iodine staining.1 The ability to accurately differentiate between iodine staining and haemorrhage in post-thrombectomy patients in a single scan has numerous benefits. The treating team can adapt anticoagulant therapy with confidence, nursing time spent doing regular observations is greatly reduced if no haemorrhage is identified, patients can be expedited to rehabilitation wards and radiation dose from repeat scans is eliminated.

Ten of them were treated prospectively with a radiation-chemotherapy protocol. All but four specimens were recently reexamined and classified according to the Working Formulation system. The predominant histologic types were diffuse large cell type, large cell immunoblastic type, and diffuse mixed small and large cell type, seen in 38%, 21% and 21% of cases, respectively. Before 1980, 16 patients were treated with postoperative radiation without definite chemotherapy, and only one has survived more than 5 years. Local recurrence was the most common cause of failure.

Eight patients completed this protocol, and all of them are alive at 16 to 100 months after diagnosis, with three patients surviving more than 5 years. Only one patient developed recurrence. On the other hand, six patients who did not complete or receive chemotherapy after 1981 are dead or alive with recurrence. Corelation between the Working Formulation subtype and prognosis was not clear because of the variety of treatment. Two patients receiving chemotherapy developed brain necrosis, which was fatal in one case, and the other two patients treated with the protocol are in a poor state without signs of recurrence. Chemotherapy may enhance the radiation effect on normal brain tissue as well as tumor. Combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy can improve the survival rate, but the optimal dosage needs to be investigated further.",Excluded
4822,"En Face OCT and OCT-Angiography in ocular oncology En Face OCT and OCT Angiography are two innovative diagnostic modalities which were adapted for the diagnosis, therapeutic decision and observation of the evolution following conservative management in ocular oncology.

3789,"Health-Related Quality of Life in large recurrence Glioblastoma treated with protontherapy Purpose or Objective: Protontherapy (PT) could minimize the risk of side effects compared to conventional photon therapy and therefore reduce the possible detrimental effect on QoL of reirradiation. We report the effect of re-irradiation with active scanning PT of large recurrence GBM in terms of quality of life scored by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)--C30 and EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Brain Cancer Module (QLQ-BN20). Material(s) and Method(s): Between January 2015 and October 2018 thirty patients with recurrence GBM were re-irradiated with active scanning PT. All patients had been previously treated with photon radiotherapy (60 Gy) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ). Median age and Karnofsky performance status at re-irradiation were 53 years (range, 30-68 years) and 80%, (range, 60-100%), respectively. Target definition was based on CT, MR, and 18F-DOPA PET imaging. Median CTV (clinical target volume) was 69 cc (range, 11-259 cc). All patients received 36 GyRBE (RBE: relative biologic effectiveness) in 18 fractions, with concomitant TMZ in 7 patients (25%). Subscales within the EORTC QLQ-C30 include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), three symptoms scales (nausea, vomiting, and fatigue), six single-item scales (insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, dyspnea, and financial effect of tumor/treatment) and global QoL. The BN20 is specifically developed for brain patients and assessed visual disorders, motor function, communication deficit, various disease symptoms, treatment, toxicity and future uncertainty. The patients completed the EORTC questionnaires before starting PT, the day of the end of PT and every follow-up consult (1-month, 3-months) until progression of disease. Result(s): The treatment was associated with stability in most of the preselected HRQOL domains. Global health improved over time with a maximum difference of 6 points between baseline and 3-months follow-up. Social functioning and motor dysfunction improved over time with a maximum difference of 8 and 2 points, respectively. We showed only a small not significance decrease in cognitive and emotional functioning. Interestingly, fatigue remained stable during the analysis such as the other preselected domains. Increase of CTV, use of steroids before protontherapy and concomitant chemotherapy are associated with a statistically significantworse QLQ C30_Social, QLQ C30_Physical and BN20_Motor values. Conclusion(s): Re-irradiation with PT for a large recurrence Glioblastoma is a safe treatment without a negative effect on HRQOL until the time of disease progression.

Grids of thermoluminescence dosemeters were attached on the head of the patient. The exposure parameters of the X-ray systems and the clinical procedures were fully documented. While for the diagnostic procedure, the dose threshold of 2 Gy for deterministic effects was not reached, this situation was much different for the embolisations. For angiography of the carotid arteries, no skin doses were measured >320 mGy. For the cerebral embolisations, maximum skin doses up to 5.4 Gy were measured. Doses to the patients varied largely between different hospitals and within the same hospital for similar procedures. On the one hand, the complexity of the pathology for interventional procedures was responsible for the large variability in dose. On the other hand, large differences in clinical protocol and technical parameters of the X-ray systems, explaining the dose variations, were also observed. A correlation was found between the maximum skin dose measured on a patient and the total dose-area product (DAP) value for cerebral embolisations. This correlation makes it possible to estimate the maximum skin dose from these DAP values and to determine a trigger level. In conclusion, management of patient doses in interventional radiology requires training, specialisation and well-documented procedure guidelines.",Excluded

3681,"The ATM gene and protein: possible roles in genome surveillance, checkpoint controls and cellular defence against oxidative stress The autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is highly pleiotropic. It is characterized by gradual loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, leading to progressive neuromotor deterioration, immunodeficiency, developmental defects in specific tissues, profound predisposition to malignancy and acute sensitivity to ionizing radiation. AT cells show chromosomal instability, premature senesence, radiosensitivity and defects in cell cycle checkpoints activated by ionizing radiation. Several radiation induced pathways that regulate the cell cycle seem to be defective in AT cells, at least one of which is mediated by TP53. Extensive characterization of the cellular defects of AT cells, together with the recent isolation of the ATM gene, has provided some insight into the possible physiological roles of the ATM protein. Several lines of evidence, including the nature of the agents that elicit the hypersensitivity of AT cells, point to the possibility of a defect in the response to damage induced by oxidative stress, which affects various cellular macromolecules. The ATM protein might have a role in activating defence mechanisms against oxidative stress. This hypothesis broadens the previous concept of the AT defect and explains several aspects of the AT phenotype that cannot be accounted for by defective processing of DNA damage.

Of 648 adult brain tumor patients who received radiation therapy at our institute, magnetic resonance (MR) image data consisting of a gradient echo (GRE) and FLAIR T2-weighted image were available three and five years after radiation therapy in 81 patients. Intracerebral hemorrhage was defined as a hypointense dot lesion appearing on GRE images after radiation therapy. The number and size of the lesions were evaluated. The T2 hyperintense WMLs observed on the FLAIR sequences were graded according to the extent of the lesion. Intracerebral hemorrhage was detected in 21 (25.9%) and 35 (43.2) patients in the three- and five-year follow-up images, respectively. The number of intracerebral hemorrhages per patient tended to increase as the follow-up period increased, whereas the size of the intracerebral hemorrhages exhibited little variation over the course of follow-up. T2 hyperintense WMLs were observed in 27 (33.3%) and 32 (39.5) patients in the three and five year follow-up images, respectively. The age at the time of radiation therapy was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the patients with T2 hyperintense WMLs than in those without lesions. Intracerebral hemorrhages are not uncommon in adult brain tumor patients undergoing radiation therapy. The incidence and number of intracerebral hemorrhages increased over the course of follow-up.

3801,"Abnormalities of thalamic volume and shape detected in fetally irradiated rhesus monkeys with high dimensional brain mapping Background: Prior research has indicated neuroanatomical abnormalities of the thalamus in schizophrenia. To study the possible pathogenesis, an animal model of neurodevelopmental thalamic damage has been developed by applying low-dose radiation to rhesus monkeys in early gestation. Irradiated monkeys sacrificed as infants demonstrate neuronal losses in specific thalamic nuclei and decreases in cortical neuropil. Method(s): Magnetic resonance scans were collected in adult Rhesus monkeys exposed to irradiation during thalamic neurogenesis (E33-42), after thalamic neurogenesis (E70-81), and in nonirradiated control animals. High dimensional brain mapping was used to compare thalamic volumes and shape characteristics in the three groups of animals. Result(s): Animals exposed to irradiation at E33-42 showed a significant bilateral loss of thalamic volumes (> 20%) compared with controls and with animals irradiated at E70-81 when total brain volume was used as a covariate in the analysis. Thalamic volume loss was associated with a nonuniform deformation of thalamic shape. Conclusion(s): A first-trimester, neurodevelopmental insult in the nonhuman primate during thalamic neurogenesis produces a complex pattern of thalamic volume loss and shape deformation in adulthood. Low-dose irradiation of the fetal primate may be useful for modeling key features of the pathology described in schizophrenic patients. © 2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",Included
4511,"Semisupervised Tripled Dictionary Learning for Standard-Dose PET Image Prediction Using Low-Dose PET and Multimodal MRI OBJECTIVE: To obtain high-quality positron emission tomography (PET) image with low-dose tracer injection, this study attempts to predict the standard-dose PET (S-PET) image from both its low-dose PET (L-PET) counterpart and corresponding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).METHODS: It was achieved by patch-based sparse representation (SR), using the training samples with a complete set of MRI, L-PET and S-PET modalities for dictionary construction. However, the number of training samples with complete modalities is often limited. In practice, many samples generally have incomplete modalities (i.e., with one or two missing modalities) that thus cannot be used in the prediction process. In light of this, we develop a semisupervised tripled dictionary learning (SSTDL) method for S-PET image prediction, which can utilize not only the samples with complete modalities (called complete samples) but also the samples with incomplete modalities (called incomplete samples), to take advantage of the large number of available training samples and thus further improve the prediction performance.RESULTS: Validation was done on a real human brain dataset consisting of 18 subjects, and the results show that our method is superior to the SR and other baseline methods.CONCLUSION: This paper proposed a new S-PET prediction method, which can significantly improve the PET image quality with low-dose injection.SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed method is favorable in clinical application since it can decrease the potential radiation risk for patients.",Excluded
3921,"Direct regulation of CREB transcriptional activity by ATM in response to genotoxic stress Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a syndrome of cancer susceptibility, immune dysfunction, and neurodegeneration that is caused by mutations in the A-T-mutated (ATM) gene. ATM has been implicated as a critical regulator of cellular responses to DNA damage, including the activation of cell cycle checkpoints and induction of apoptosis. Although defective cell cycle-checkpoint regulation and associated genomic instability presumably contribute to cancer susceptibility in A-T, the mechanism of neurodegeneration in A-T is not well understood. In addition, although ATM is required for the induction of the p53 transcriptional program in response to DNA damage, the identities of the relevant transcription factors that mediate ATM-dependent changes in gene expression remain largely undetermined. In this article, we describe a signal transduction pathway linking ATM directly to the Ca(2+)/cAMP response element-binding protein, CREB, a transcription factor that regulates cell growth, homeostasis, and survival. ATM phosphorylated CREB in vitro and in vivo in response to ionizing radiation (IR) and H(2)O(2) on a stress-inducible domain. IR-induced phosphorylation of CREB correlated with a decrease in CREB transactivation potential and reduced interaction between CREB and its transcriptional coactivator, CREB-binding protein (CBP). A CREB mutant containing Ala substitutions at ATM phosphorylation sites displayed enhanced transactivation potential, resistance to inhibition by IR, and increased binding to CBP. We propose that ATM-mediated phosphorylation of CREB in response to DNA damage modulates CREB-dependent gene expression and that dysregulation of the ATM-CREB pathway may contribute to neurodegeneration in A-T.",Excluded

4469,"Acute exposure to low-level light at night is sufficient to induce neurological changes and depressive-like behavior The advent and wide-spread adoption of electric lighting over the past century has profoundly affected the circadian organization of physiology and behavior for many individuals in industrialized nations; electric lighting in homes, work environments, and public areas have extended daytime activities into the evening, thus, increasing night-time exposure to light. Although initially assumed to be innocuous, chronic exposure to light at night (LAN) is now associated with increased incidence of cancer, metabolic disorders, and affective problems in humans. However, little is known about potential acute effects of LAN. To determine whether acute exposure to low-level LAN alters brain function, adult male, and female mice were housed in either light days and dark nights (LD; 14 h of 150 lux:10 h of 0 lux) or light days and low level light at night (LAN; 14 h of 150 lux:10 h of 5 lux). Mice exposed to LAN on three consecutive nights increased depressive-like responses compared to mice housed in dark nights. In addition, female mice exposed to LAN increased central tendency in the open field. LAN was associated with reduced hippocampal vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in both male and female mice, as well as increased VEGFR1 and interleukin-1beta mRNA expression in females, and reduced brain derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in males. Further, LAN significantly altered circadian rhythms (activity and temperature) and circadian gene expression in female and male mice, respectively.

4069,"Cancer therapy, vomiting, and antiemetics Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy for cancer are capable of causing nausea and vomiting. With both treatment modalities, the nausea and vomiting is thought to be a second-order process rather than being due to direct stimulation of neuromechanisms that control vomiting. Both a peripheral (gastrointestinal tract) and central (chemoreceptor trigger zone) effect may be operating with both radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-induced vomiting. With radiotherapy, gastrointestinal toxicity is affected by the type of radiation, radiation dose and field size, fractionation schedule, individual patient factors, and the part of the patient that is radiated. Many different factors also influence the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy. With both radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting is probably mediated by a reduction in breakdown of various neurotransmitters. It is presumed that as the levels of neurotransmitters increase, nausea and vomiting develop. Antagonists of these neurotransmitters may afford some antiemetic protection. Nausea and vomiting may be so severe in patients with cancer that they may refuse potentially curative therapy because of it. Anticipatory nausea and vomiting may develop in patients who have become quite sick after receiving treatment. Exposure to stimuli associated with the emetogenic agent is then sufficient to trigger nausea and vomiting. Standard antiemetics do not help anticipatory nausea and vomiting, although behavioural training may. A variety of different drugs have proven useful as antiemetics, including dopamine antagonists such as phenothiazines, metoclopramide, corticosteroids (dexamethasone and methylprednisolone), cannabinoids, and benzodiazapines. Antihistamines and anticholinergics are of value in some situations. New serotonin antagonists appear to be very promising and are currently undergoing clinical studies.

In studies investigating methylation and the role of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, the effect of this treatment upon the methylation itself is not well understood. We aimed to investigate any differences in methylation before or after treatment. Method(s): Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer were identified. Tumour tissue from pretreatment biopsies and post treatment resections for the same patients was subjected to DNA extraction. This was also modelled in vitro by administering ionizing radiation (7-15 Gy) to a colorectal cancer cell line and extracting DNA 48 hour later. Methylation specific PCR was used to characterize the methylation status of CpG islands in the promoter regions of 8 genes associated with rectal cancer. PCR band size and intensity was measured to give a semiquantiative analysis of methylation intensity in the cell line experiment. Result(s): 17 patients underwent analysis. Methylation was seen less frequently in post treatment specimens for all 8 markers, however, this difference was significant for one marker (ADAMTS1, 10/17 methylated pre vs 0/17 post, P = 0.001) and approached significance for another (hMLH1, 6/17 vs 1/17, P = 0.08).

Ion beam therapy, specifically carbon ions radiotherapy (CIRT) have some advantages for the favorable relative biological effectiveness and physical dose distribution providing a highly conformal dose distribution while minimizing normal tissue damage. The aim of this study is to report our experience on feasibility and toxicity of carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in previously irradiated patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Between August 2014 and February 2017, a total of 10 patients (M:F= 8:2) were treated with CIRT as re-irradiation for locally recurrent rectal cancer at National Centre of Oncological Hadrontherapy (CNAO). Patient ages ranged between 46 to 78 years (median 58.5 years). All patients had a history of surgery and pelvic radiotherapy. Specifically, the dose of previous radiotherapy ranged from 45 to 50.4 Gy in 9 patients one of which received a brachytherapy boost up to a total dose of 20Gy. One patient was irradiated with a total dose of 76 Gy for a prostatic cancer. One patient, at time of the first recurrence, underwent to re-irradiation with stereotactic radiotherapy (30 Gy in 6 fractions). They had 7 presacral, 1 perineal, 1 perianal and 1 pre-coccygeal relapses. Three patients received spacer implantation prior to CIRT to secure adequate distance between bowel and tumor. Toxicity was scored according CTCAE 4.0 scale. Results The median interval between the two courses of radiotherapy was 89.3 months (range: 13.8 - 138.2). Median total dose of CIRT was 60 GyRBE (range: 35-76.8) and was administered in a median number of 16 fractions (range: 15-20) over 4 weeks (from 3 to 4.8 Gy RBE/fraction). The GTV ranged from 7.21 to 300.8 cm<sup>3</sup> with a median of 28.42 cm<sup>3</sup>. The PTV ranged from 53.55 to 742.64 cm<sup>3</sup>. All patients completed the scheduled treatment course. Median follow-up was 13 months. Acute toxicity was mild and mainly neuropathic: grade 2 (G2) neuropathic pain in 1 (10%) and G1 in 2 (20%) patients. The major late toxicities were peripheral neuropathy (20%, G2). No G>=3 acute/late reaction nor pelvic infections were observed. Four patients were diagnosed with local progression after carbon ion radiotherapy with a median disease free survival of 11.4 months (range: 2.4- 39.7). Three patients experienced systemic progression. The estimated 1-year-local control rate was 80%.

4421,"Radiation exposure to the surgeon and the patient during posterior lumbar spinal instrumentation: a prospective randomized comparison of navigated versus non-navigated freehand techniques STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized study.OBJECTIVE: To compare occupational radiation exposure to the surgeon, as well as the patient, during posterior lumbar spine instrumentation in 10 navigated cases (navigated) versus 11 cases using the freehand technique (non-navigated).SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The use of navigation increases the accuracy of posterior lumbar instrumentation.A further speculated benefit of navigation is the reduction of radiation exposure of the surgeon. However, this has so far not been evaluated in such comparative manner.METHODS: Radiation exposure to the surgeon was measured by digital dosimeters placed at the level of the eye, chest, and dominant forearm. Radiation exposure was measured from the time of positioning of the patient to the end of the procedure both for navigated (intraoperative 3-dimensional [3D] fluoroscopy-based) and non-navigated (2-dimensional fluoroscopy-guided) freehand posterior lumbar spine instrumentations. A 3D fluoroscopic scan was routinely performed at the end of the procedure for all patients.RESULTS: Patients were distributed evenly in the 2 groups in terms of sex, age, body mass index, and the number of operated levels. The accumulated radiation dose for the surgeon was significantly higher in the non-navigated group; up to 9.96 times. The radiation dose for the patient was higher with the freehand technique, 1884.8 cGy.cm (non-navigated) versus 887 cGy.cm (navigated), without reaching a statistically significant level.CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure to the surgeon during pedicle screw placement with the freehand technique is up to 9.96 times greater than with the use of navigation. In the latter group, the only radiation exposure comes from the preoperative-level control and positioning of the 3D C-arm before 3D fluoroscopic acquisition. Furthermore, neuronavigation also reduces the cumulative dose for the patient.Level of evidence: 2.",Excluded
4341,"Biophysical properties of the synucleins and their propensities to fibrillate: inhibition of alpha-synuclein assembly by beta- and gamma-synucleins The pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the presence of intracellular inclusions, Lewy bodies, and Lewy neurites, in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and several other brain regions. Filamentous alpha-synuclein is the major component of these deposits and its aggregation is believed to play an important role in Parkinson's disease and several other neurodegenerative diseases. Two homologous proteins, beta- and gamma-synucleins, are also abundant in the brain. The synucleins are natively unfolded proteins. beta-Synuclein, which lacks 11 central hydrophobic residues compared with its homologs, exhibited the properties of a random coil, whereas alpha- and gamma-synucleins were slightly more compact and structured. gamma-Synuclein, unlike its homologs, formed a soluble oligomer at relatively low concentrations, which appears to be an off-fibrillation pathway species. Here we show that, although they have similar biophysical properties to alpha-synuclein, beta- And gamma-synucleins inhibit alpha-synuclein fibril formation. Complete inhibition of alpha-synuclein fibrillation was observed at 4:1 molar excess of beta- and gamma-synucleins. No significant incorporation of beta-synuclein into the fibrils was detected. The lack of fibrils formed by beta-synuclein is most readily explained by the absence of a stretch of hydrophobic residues from the middle region of the protein. A model for the inhibition is proposed.",Excluded
4474,"Low-dose total-body carbon-ion irradiations induce early transcriptional alteration without late Alzheimer's disease-like pathogenesis and memory impairment in mice The cause and risk factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are largely unknown. Studies on possible radiation-induced AD-like pathogenesis and behavioral consequences are important because humans are exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) from various sources. It was reported that total-body irradiations (TBI) at 10 cGy of low linear energy transfer (LET) X-rays to mice triggered acute transcriptional alterations in genes associated with cognitive dysfunctions. However, it was unknown whether low doses of IR could induce AD-like changes late after exposure. We reported previously that 10 cGy X-rays induced early transcriptional response of several AD-related genes in hippocampi without late AD-like pathogenesis and memory impairment in mice. Here, further studies on two low doses (5 or 10 cGy) of high LET carbonion irradiations are reported. On expression of 84 AD-related genes in hippocampi, at 4 hr after TBI, 5 cGy induced a significant upregulation of three genes (Abca1, Casp3, and Chat) and 10 cGy led to a marked upregulation of one gene (Chat) and a downregulation of three genes (Apoe, Ctsd, and Il1alpha), and, at 1 year after TBI, one gene (Il1alpha) was significantly downregulated in 10 cGy-irradiated animals. Changes in spatial learning ability and memory and induction of AD-like pathogenesis were not detected by in vivo brain imaging for amyloid-beta peptide accumulation and by immunohistochemical staining of amyloid precursor protein, amyloid-beta protein, tau, and phosphorylated tau protein. These findings indicate that low doses of carbon-ion irradiations did not cause behavioral impairment or AD-like pathological change in mice.",Included
4374,"Mechanism of magnetization transfer during on-resonance water saturation. A new approach to detect mobile proteins, peptides, and lipids The mechanism of magnetization transfer (MT) between water and components of the proton spectrum was studied ex vivo in a perfused cell system and in vivo in the rat brain (n = 5). Water was selectively labeled and spectral buildup consequential to transfer of longitudinal magnetization was followed as a function of time. At short mixing time (T(m)), nitrogen-bound solvent-exchangeable protons were observed, predominantly assigned to amide groups of proteins and peptides. At longer T(m), intramolecular nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) was observed in the aliphatic proton region, leading to a mobile-macromolecule-weighted spectrum that resembles typical protein spectra described in the literature. This effect on the proton spectrum is distinct from that of classical off-resonance MT, which has been shown to be due to the immobile solid-like proton pool. When studying a solution of major brain metabolites under physiological concentrations and conditions (pH), no transfer effects were observed, in line with expectations based on reduced NOE effects in rapidly tumbling molecules and the fast proton exchange rates of amino, amine, SH, and OH groups. The spectral intensities of the amide protons may serve as indicators for pH and cellular levels of mobile proteins and peptides, while the aliphatic components are representative of several types of mobile macromolecules, including proteins, peptides, and lipids.",Excluded

However, the diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) have not yet been established for nuclear medicine imaging studies in Korea. Material(s) and Method(s): The data of administered activity in 32 nuclear medicine imaging studies were collected from the Korean Society of Nuclear Medicine (KSNM) dose survey database from 2013 and 2014. Through the expert discussions and statistical analyses, the 75th quartile value (Q3) was suggested as the preliminary DRL values. Preliminary DRLs were subjected to approval process by the KSNM Board of Directors and KSNM Council, followed by clinical applications and performance rating by domestic institutes. Result(s): DRLs were determined through 32 nuclear medicine imaging studies. The Q3 value was considered as appropriate selection as it was generally consistent with the most commonly administered activity. In the present study, the final version of initial DRL values for nuclear medicine imaging in Korean adults is described including various protocols of the brain and myocardial perfusion imaging. Conclusion(s): The first DRLs for nuclear medicine imaging in Korean adults were confirmed. The DRLs will enable optimized radiation protection in the field of nuclear medicine imaging in Korea.

4629,"NF-kappaB activation in light-induced retinal degeneration in a mouse model PURPOSE: To investigate the modulation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in light-induced photoreceptor degeneration in a mouse model.METHODS: Mice were exposed to intense green light. Light-induced activation of NF-kappaB and its nuclear localization were studied by immunohistochemistry. The NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in the retinas after exposure to light was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Nuclear transactivation of NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor cells was determined by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. The amount of NF-kappaB p65 in the photoreceptor cells after exposure to light was assessed by Western blot analysis. To obtain more photoreceptor-specific information, microdissected photoreceptor cells were used in some studies.RESULTS: By an immunohistochemical method, the perinuclear region of the photoreceptor cells was heavily labeled with an antibody to activated NF-kappaB after a 1-hour exposure to light. Nuclear localization of NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor nucleus was seen at 12 hours. In the experiments involving 3 hours of exposure to light followed by recovery in the dark, nuclear localization of NF-kappaB was also noted after 12 hours' recovery in the dark. During continuous exposure to light, the NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity gradually increased and reached its maximum at 12 hours. There was an increase of NF-kappaB p65 protein at 3 hours. The mRNA levels of IkappaBalpha were upregulated after 6 hours' exposure to light.CONCLUSIONS: Intense light activated NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor cells in vivo, increased the NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity, and increased the expression of mRNA of IkappaBalpha, a target gene of NF-kappaB.",Excluded
3753,"Implant therapy in irradiated patients In this multicenter study, submerged implants were prospectively followed to evaluate their long-term prognosis in irradiated patients. In a total of 77 patients treated for oral or neck cancer, 188 implants were consecutively placed. After a healing period, the successfully integrated implants were restored with 69 removable and 38 fixed restorations. The implants cumulative survival and success rates were evaluated over a period of at least 36 months. In addition, cumulative success rates were calculated for implant subgroups divided per implant site (mandible or maxilla), radiation dosage, and the time interval between the last irradiation and implant placement. During the healing period, 20 implants did not successfully integrate, whereas 168 implants were classified as success (including both survival and success rates). The analysis of implant subgroups showed slightly more favorable cumulative success rate for mandibular implants (98.4%) compared with maxillary implants (57.1%) and clearly better success rate for a radiation dosage minor of 50-Gy doses. A time greater than 12 months as interval between last irradiation and implant placement seems not to promote better clinical results.",Excluded
3741,"Influence of backscatter radiation on cranial reconstruction implants Objective: We aimed to evaluate backscatter dose variations in different cranial bone implant materials in an experimental model designed to simulate postoperative radiotherapy. Method(s): We assessed the radiation backscatter doses associated with sheet- and mesh-type titanium plates and hydroxyapatite (HAP) samples (porosity: 35%, 50% and 85%). The samples were irradiated with 6- and 10-MV photon beams from a linear accelerator. Measurements were obtained using an ionization chamber and radiochromic films cut from the same batch. Result(s): At 6MV, the titanium sheet showed the highest peak for backscattered radiation, followed by (in decreasing order) HAP30%, HAP50%, titanium mesh and HAP85%. At 10MV, HAP30% showed the highest peak, followed by HAP50%, titanium sheet, titanium mesh and HAP85%. The peaks were at different depths in the titanium and HAP samples. The thickness of the human scalp is approximately 7mm; therefore, measurements were obtained 0-7mm above the implants to assess the likely dose on the scalp. A comparison of the maximum dose on the scalp showed the titanium sheet had the highest dose at both 6 and 10MV. Conclusion(s): The backscatter dose differed with the density of the material and the backscatter depth was different for each material. Advances in knowledge: Ulcer formation due to radiotherapy after brain tumour depends on not only radiation but also the implant material. Therefore, the density and type of implant material should be considered when planning radiotherapy and selecting bone reconstruction materials. Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

4740,"A Novel Validated Recurrence Risk Score to Guide a Pragmatic Surveillance Strategy After Resection of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors: An International Study of 1006 Patients OBJECTIVE: Despite heterogeneous biology, similar surveillance schemas are utilized after resection of all pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). Given concerns regarding excess radiation exposure and financial burden, our aim was to develop a prognostic score for disease recurrence to guide individually tailored surveillance strategies.METHODS: All patients with primary nonfunctioning, nonmetastatic well/moderately differentiated PanNETs who underwent curative-intent resection at 9-institutions from 2000 to 2016 were included (n = 1006). A Recurrence Risk Score (RRS) was developed from a randomly selected derivation cohort comprised of 67% of patients and verified on the validation-cohort comprised of the remaining 33%.RESULTS: On multivariable analysis, patients within the derivation cohort (n = 681) with symptomatic tumors (jaundice, pain, bleeding), tumors >2 cm, Ki67 >3%, and lymph node (LN) (+) disease had increased recurrence. Each factor was assigned a score based on their weighted odds ratio that formed a RRS of 0 to 10: symptomatic = 1, tumor >2 cm = 2, Ki67 3% to 20% = 1, Ki67 >20% = 6, LN (+) = 1. Patients were grouped into low- (RRS = 0-2; n = 247), intermediate-(RRS = 3-5; n = 204), or high (RRS = 6-10; n = 9)-risk groups. At 24 months, 33% of high RRS recurred, whereas only 2% of low and 14% of intermediate RRS recurred. This persisted in the validation cohort (n = 325).CONCLUSIONS: This international, novel, internally validated RRS accurately stratifies recurrence-free survival for patients with resected PanNETs. Given their unique recurrence patterns, surveillance intervals of 12, 6, and 3 months are proposed for low, intermediate, and high RRS patients, respectively, to minimize radiation exposure and optimize cost/resource utilization.",Excluded
4307,"Biologically effective dose and prediction of obliteration of unruptured arteriovenous malformations treated by upfront Gamma Knife radiosurgery: A series of 149 consecutive cases OBJECTIVE Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) present no pathologic tissue, and radiation dose is confined in a clear targeted volume. The authors retrospectively evaluated the role of the biologically effective dose (BED) after Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for brain AVMs. METHODS A total of 149 consecutive cases of unruptured AVMs treated by upfront GKRS in Lille University Hospital, France, were included. The mean length of follow-up was 52.9 months (median 48, range 12-154 months). The primary outcome was obliteration, and the secondary outcome was complication appearance. The marginal dose was 24 Gy in a vast majority of cases (n = 115, 77.2%; range 18-25 Gy). The mean BED was 220.1 Gy<inf>2.47</inf> (median 229.9, range 106.7-246.8 Gy<inf>2.47</inf>). The mean beam-on time was 32.3 minutes (median 30.8, range 9-138.7 minutes). In the present series, the mean radiation dose rate was 2.259 Gy/min (median 2.176, range 1.313-3.665 Gy/min). The Virginia score was 0 in 29 (19.5%), 1 in 61 (40.9%), 2 in 41 (27.5%), 3 in 18 (12.1%), and 4 in 0 (0%) patients, respectively. The mean Pollock-Flickinger score was 1.11 (median 1.52, range 0.4-2.9). Univariate (for obliteration and complication appearance) and multivariate (for obliteration only) analyses were performed. RESULTS A total of 104 AVMs (69.8%) were obliterated at the last follow-up. The strongest predictor for obliteration was BED (p = 0.03). A radiosurgical obliteration score is proposed, derived from a fitted multivariable model: (0.018 x BED) + (1.58 x V12) + (-0.013689 x beam-on time) + (0.021 x age) - 4.38. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.7438; after internal validation using bootstrap methods, it was 0.7088. No statistically significant relationship between radiation dose rate and obliteration was found (p = 0.29). Twenty-eight (18.8%) patients developed complications after GKRS; 20 (13.4%) of these patients had transient adverse radiological effects (perilesional edema developed). Predictors for complication appearance were higher prescription isodose volume (p = 0.005) and 12-Gy isodose line volume (V12; p = 0.001), higher Pollock-Flickinger (p = 0.02) and Virginia scores (p = 0.003), and lower beam-on time (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS The BED was the strongest predictor of obliteration of unruptured AVMs after upfront GKRS. A radiosurgical score comprising the BED is proposed. The V12 appears as a predictor for both efficacy and toxicity. Beam-on time was illustrated as statistically significant for both obliteration and complication appearance. The radiation dose rate did not influence obliteration in the current analysis. The exact BED threshold remains to be established by further studies.

3749,"Identification of the S3 foramen during transforaminal sacral neuromodulation lead placement-a novel ""rolling pen"" technique INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is FDA approved for urinary urgency, urinary frequency, urgency urinary incontinence, non-obstructive urinary retention and fecal incontinence. SNM modulates electrical input to the bladder preventing and decreasing over stimulation, thus improving symptoms. The S3 foramen must be localized for lead implantation and the efficacy of implantation depends on the ability to localize S3 reliably and correctly. Localization is accomplished using various strategies, most commonly using a combination of palpation of bony landmarks and fluoroscopy. This paper will serve to introduce a novel ""rolling pen"" technique that eliminates the use of fluoroscopy for S3 identification. This technique is currently used in clinical practice by the two highest volume implanters in Louisiana. METHOD(S): The patients were positioned prone and prepped in the usual manner. Instead of using fluoroscopy or palpation to identify bony landmarks to localize the S3 foramen, we balanced a marking pen longitudinally in the midline of the sacrum. The pen was allowed to roll until horizontal equilibrium was established. The fulcrum of the balanced ""rolling pen"" identified the level of S3. A mark 2 cm proximal and 2 cm lateral to this landmark was made for entry of the finder needle at the level of the skin. We then proceeded with our implantation in the usual manner. The rolling pen technique was used for all patients as our initial strategy to identify the S3 foramen. RESULT(S): 228 implantations were performed between 7/2012 and 10/2014 at our 2 tertiary centers. All cases used the rolling pen technique as our initial S3 foramen identification strategy. Adhering to the ALARA principle, fluoroscopy was limited to confirming and adjusting needle and lead placement in the operating room. All office procedures were performed without fluoroscopy. CONCLUSION(S): We conclude that the novel rolling pen technique can be used as yet another method for S3 localization during transforaminal lead placement during SNM implantation.

3774,"Low-power inversion recovery MRI preserves brain tissue contrast for patients with Parkinson disease with deep brain stimulators BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fast spin-echo short tau inversion recovery sequences have been very useful for MR imaging-guided deep brain stimulation procedures in Parkinson disease. However, high-quality fast spin-echo imaging deposits significant heat, exceeding FDA-approved limits when patients already have undergone deep brain stimulation and need a second one or a routine brain MR imaging for neurologic indications. We have developed a STIR sequence with an ultra-low specific absorption rate that meets hardware limitations and produces adequate tissue contrast in cortical and subcortical brain tissues for deep brain stimulation recipients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with medically refractory Parkinson disease who qualified for deep brain stimulation were imaged at 1.5T with a fast spin-echo short tau inversion recovery sequence modified to meet conditional MR imaging hardware and specific absorption rate restrictions. Tissue contrast-to-noise ratios and implant localization were objectively and subjectively compared by 2 neuroradiologists, and image quality for surgical planning was assessed by a neurosurgeon for high and low specific absorption rate images.RESULTS: The mean contrast-to-noise ratio for cerebral tissues without including the contrast-to-noise ratio for ventricular fluid was 35 and 31 for high and low specific absorption rate images. Subjective ratings for low specific absorption rate tissue contrast in 77% of patients were identical to (and in a few cases higher than) those of high specific absorption rate contrast, while the neurosurgical coordinates for fusing the stereotactic atlas with low specific absorption rate MR imaging were equivalent to those of the high specific absorption rate for 69% of patients.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Parkinson disease who have already had a deep brain stimulation face a risk of neural injury if routine, high specific absorption rate MR imaging is performed. Our modified fast spin-echo short tau inversion recovery sequence conforms to very conservative radiofrequency safety limits, while it maintains high tissue contrast for presurgical planning, postsurgical assessment, and radiologic evaluations with greater confidence for radiofrequency safety.",Excluded
4595,"Antegrade transapical branched aortic arch endograft-a feasibility study in pigs Background: To describe the technique and proof the concept of a complete transapical deployment of a single sidebranch arch endograft in a porcine model. Method(s): Eight domestic pigs were operated with antegrade transapical delivery of a single-sidebranch arch endograft including a mating stentgraft to the innominate artery. Technical feasibility, operating time, radiation parameters and hemodynamic changes were studied according to standardized protocol during baseline (T0), after establishing of the transapical access and through-and-through wire (T1) and after stent-graft deployment (T2). Myocardial and cerebral perfusion were assessed by fluorescent-microspheres (FM) and transit-time-flow measurement (TTFM). Result(s): Transapical access, introduction and deployment of the endograft, sidebranch catheterization and deployment of the mating stent-graft were feasible in 6 of the 8 animals with unimpeded perfusion of the innominate artery. One animal was lost during transapical access, one during sire-branch catheterization. The mean operating and fluoroscopy times were 157+/-47min and 15.9+/-3.2min. During introduction and deployment of the stent-graft transient aortic valve insufficiency occurred in all animals. Hemodynamic stability recovered within ten minutes after retrieval of the delivery system in all animals. The innominate artery was patent with unchanged TTFM-flow measurements throughout the procedure. FM evaluation revealed stable myocardial and cerebral perfusion. Conclusion(s): Antegrade transapical access to the aortic arch for implantation of a single sidebranch arch endograft is feasible in a porcine model with reversible impact on hemodynamic measures during deployment. Transapical access allows for deployment of a complex endograft through a single large bore access-site in a porcine model. It might be a future treatment option for selective patients.",Excluded
4580,"Sacral nerve stimulator use in a patient with low anterior resection syndrome Introduction: Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer are treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgical resection. Advanced surgical techniques such as mesorectal excision have enabled sphincter sparing surgery to be accomplished for patients with distal cancers. Although these procedures are being done more frequently, they remain fraught with both immediate perioperative and long term complications. Fecal Incontinence (FI) is a significant long term postoperative complication which can result following such surgical intervention. While reports show improvement over a 1-2 year period, a significant number of patients continue to experience FI and the so called Low Anterior Syndrome (LAS). Sacral nerve neuromodulation has been traditionally used for treatment of urinary incontinence with the use of Sacral Nerve Stimulator (SNS) implantation and is now being utilized to treat FI. We report the initial successful use of SNS to treat fecal incontinence secondary to radiation and postoperative changes following treatment for rectal cancer. A 70 year old Asian female was diagnosed with stage III rectal cancer and underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by low anterior resection with diverting ileostomy in 2011. Her ostomy was reversed in August 2012 and she developed fecal incontinence. Non-operative measures were taken in attempt to improve her incontinence without success including fiber supplementation and pelvic floor therapy. Method(s): Prior to SNS implantation the patient was given a Cleveland Clinic Fecal Incontinence Score (CCFIS). Patients rate daily incontinence episodes on a 4 point scale in 5 categories including incontinence to solids, liquids, gas, frequency of protective undergarment pads and need to modify lifestyle. A score of 0 in each category is equivalent to never events and a score of 4 is equal to always with 20 being a maximum score. The patient then underwent placement of the SNS probes into the S3 foramen. This was followed by a 1 week test period in which the patient had the probes connected to an external modulator. Following the test phase she then was reassessed with the CCFIS. Result(s): The patients initial CCFIS was the maximum score of 20. Following insertion of the probe at 1 week the patient reported an improvement in her CCFIS to 11. She maintained incontinence to solids usually (score of 3), liquid never (0), gas always (4), use of pads always (4), lifestyle modification never (0). Conclusion(s): Sacral Nerve Stimulator insertion is potentially an effective treatment for fecal incontinence for patients that have undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiation and resection for rectal cancer. Further study is warranted on larger sample sizes to ensure consistency of results and long term outcomes should be measured.",Excluded

The patients were randomized to receive two different postoperative external radiation protocols, Study Group A: Localized field external radiotherapy 50 Gy/25#/5 wks followed by Boost 10 Gy/5#/1 wk, Control Group B: Whole brain external radiotherapy 40 Gy/20#/4 wks followed by Boost 20 Gy/10#/2 wks by localized field.RESULTS: 20/25 (80%) patients in the study group and 14/25 (56%) patients in the control group showed improvement in their Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Thus a significant difference in the performance status was noted in favor of limited field irradiation. No significant difference in the local response was seen between the two groups after radiotherapy. Six months progression-free survival of the study group was 44% as compared to 26% in the control group. Six months overall survival was 66.67% in the study group and 50.72% in the control group (P<0.01).

4045,"Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibition delays recurrence of glioblastoma after radiation by altering myeloid cell recruitment and polarization BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) may initially respond to treatment with ionizing radiation (IR), but the prognosis remains extremely poor because the tumors invariably recur. Using animal models, we previously showed that inhibiting stromal cell-derived factor 1 signaling can prevent or delay GBM recurrence by blocking IR-induced recruitment of myeloid cells, specifically monocytes that give rise to tumor-associated macrophages. The present study was aimed at determining if inhibiting colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) signaling could be used as an alternative strategy to target pro-tumorigenic myeloid cells recruited to irradiated GBM.METHODS: To inhibit CSF-1 signaling in myeloid cells, we used PLX3397, a small molecule that potently inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R). Combined IR and PLX3397 therapy was compared with IR alone using 2 different human GBM intracranial xenograft models.RESULTS: GBM xenografts treated with IR upregulated CSF-1R ligand expression and increased the number of CD11b+ myeloid-derived cells in the tumors. Treatment with PLX3397 both depleted CD11b+ cells and potentiated the response of the intracranial tumors to IR. Median survival was significantly longer for mice receiving combined therapy versus IR alone. Analysis of myeloid cell differentiation markers indicated that CSF-1R inhibition prevented IR-recruited monocyte cells from differentiating into immunosuppressive, pro-angiogenic tumor-associated macrophages.CONCLUSION: CSF-1R inhibition may be a promising strategy to improve GBM response to radiotherapy.",Excluded
4671,"Quantitative Evaluation of Focused Ultrasound with a Contrast Agent on Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption The use of an ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) with focused ultrasound sonication has the potential to disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB) noninvasively and reversibly at target locations. This study investigated the effects of UCA dose and ultrasound pressure on BBB disruption. Sonications were applied at 1 MHz with a burst length of 10 ms, a 1% duty cycle and a repetition frequency of 1 Hz. The duration of the sonication was 30 s. In in vivo experiments, 16 male Wistar rats were sonicated in the presence of UCA at four doses (0, 30, 60 and 90 muL/kg). BBB integrity was evaluated by injecting Evans blue (EB) into the femoral vein of anesthetized rats. The relationship between UCA dose and the region of EB extravasation was evaluated at ultrasound pressures of 0.9 and 1.2 MPa. The BBB disruption, as quantified by the amount of EB extravasation, was significantly greater in rats injected with UCA at a dose of 60 or 90 muL/kg than at a dose of 0 or 30 muL/kg. The amount of EB extravasation increased monotonically with the quantity of UCA injected into the femoral vein before sonication. Furthermore, the BBB disruption could be enhanced in the focal region relative to the surrounding region with a higher dose of UCA (60 or 90 muL/kg). This study demonstrates that BBB disruption can be both increased and localized to the focal region by injecting an appropriate quantity of UCA before performing focused ultrasound sonications.

Their median age was 64 years. The median dose of <sup>131</sup>I-mIBG administered was 6751 MBq, and there was an average of 2.8 treatments per patient. During the same period, 58 patients with metastatic carcinoid were treated at center B with similar multimodality therapy without the use of <sup>131</sup>I-mIBG therapy. Their median age was 65 years. Survivals at 3 and 5 years were 77% and 63%, respectively (95% CI 47-75), for group A. The 3- and 5-year survivals for group B were 56% and 47% (95% CI 34-59), respectively. The mean follow-up was 6.6 years for group A and 5.0 years for group B.

4605,"Gamma knife radiosurgery after stereotactic aspiration for large cystic brain metastases Objective : Several treatment options have proven effective for metastatic brain tumors, including surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery. Tumors with cystic components, however, are difficult to treat using a single method. We retrospectively assessed the outcome and efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for cystic brain metastases after stereotactic aspiration of cystic components to decrease the tumor volume. Methods : The study population consisted of 24 patients (13 males, 11 females; mean age, 58.3 years) with cystic metastatic brain tumors treated from January 2002 to August 2008. Non-small cell lung cancer was the most common primary origin. After Leksell stereotactic frame was positioned on each patient, magnetic resonance images (MRI)-guided stereotactic cyst aspiration and GKRS were performed (mean prescription dose : 20.2 Gy). After treatment, patients were evaluated by MRI every 3 or 4 months. Results : After treatment, 13 patients (54.2%) demonstrated tumor control, 5 patients (20.8%) showed local tumor progression, and 6 patients (25.0%) showed remote progression. Mean follow-up duration was 13.1 months. During this period, 10 patients (41.7%) died, but only 1 patient (4.2%) died from brain metastases. The overall median survival after these procedures was 17.8 months. Conclusion : These results support the usefulness of GKRS after stereotactic cyst aspiration in patients with large cystic brain metastases. This method is especially effective for the patients whose general condition is very poor for general anesthesia and those with metastatic brain tumors located in eloquent areas.

3838,"Modulation of acute coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis in gamma-irradiated rats by transfer of naive lymphocyte subsets before infection Clinical course, recovery of infectious virus from brain tissue and histopathology of the central nervous system were examined in gamma-irradiated Lewis rats reconstituted by naive lymphocytes before infection with coronavirus MHV-4 (strain JHM). Up to 9 days past infection, no differences were seen between immunologically competent and immuno-deficient animals in terms of onset and progression of neurological disease. However, in the latter animals neurological symptoms were dominated by signs of encephalitis instead of paralytic disease as usually seen in immunocompetent animals. Nevertheless, despite high titers of infectious virus in the CNS of immunodeficient animals only mild histopathological changes were noticeable. In contrast, infectious virus in the CNS of immunologically competent animals was below the detection limit of the assay. Paralytic disease and tissue destruction were T lymphocyte mediated because gamma-irradiated rats that were reconstituted by CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocyte enriched cells in the absence of B lymphocytes revealed an earlier onset of clinical symptoms and a more rapid deterioration of their clinical state compared to fully competent animals. Whereas in CD4+ T cell reconstituted animals infectious virus was moderately reduced and tissue destruction as well as inflammatory changes in the CNS were focal, in CD8+ T cell reconstituted animals vacuolizing white matter inflammation was diffuse without reduction of infectious virus in brain tissue. From the presented data we conclude that in the acute stage of JHMV-induced encephalomyelitis of Lewis rats: (i) tissue destruction and paralytic clinical symptomatology are mainly T cell-mediated; (ii) CD4+ T lymphocytes can directly contribute to reduction of viral load in the brain and (iii) only coordinated action of both, the T and the B cell compartment enables animals to survive the infection and recover from disease.",Excluded

4157,"Extracranial carotid stenosis after radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a Malaysian study Background and objectives: Radiation treatment in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is known to be associated with increased prevalence of carotid stenosis. The objectives of the study was to determine the prevalence of radiation-induced extracranial carotid stenosis, plaque, carotid intima thickness (CIMT) in NPC patients; to explore whether the stenosis is due to direct effect of radiation rather than general tendency to atherosclerosis. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the University Malaya Medical Centre from July 2011 to February 2012. The study subjects consisted of 47 NPC patients who were treated with radiation, and 47 healthy control. The patients and control had carotid duplex ultrasound and transcranial Doppler (TCD). Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 55.1 years, the time lapse from radiation was 76.7 +/- 95.3 months. Internal carotid artery (ICA) and common carotid artery (CCA) stenosis of >=50% was seen in 17.0% of patients vs 2.1 % of controls (p = 0.031), with 61.7% of patients and 19.1% of controls having plaque in ICA and CCA (p=0.004). CIMT was increased in 70.2% of patients and 44.7% of controls (p =0.022). Both the patient group and control had similar rate of intracranial stenosis of 12.8% in TCD. Conclusion(s): Extracranial internal carotid artery is the most common site of stenosis following radiotherapy in NPC.

We hypothesized that in this malignancy, procoagulant and inflammatory mediators contribute to the pathogenesis of such complications and warfarin may down regulate these levels. Method(s): In a prospective, randomized, controlled study, patients with inoperable lung cancer (n=100) were randomized to receive chemotherapy and radiation with and without warfarin (INR 1.5 - 2.5). Blood samples were drawn prior to and after the 2nd treatment cycle with warfarin or control and retrospectively analyzed for microparticles and thrombin generation markers such as fibrinopeptide A (FPA), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and prothrombin fragment F1.2 (F1.2). In addition, biochip array for C-reactive protein (CRP), D Dimer, neuron specific enolase (NSE), neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), and thrombomodulin (TM) were measured. The results were compared with a normal population (N=50). Result(s): The microparticles were markedly increased in the SCLC patients (3 fold increase) at baseline. Similary, the thrombin generation markers showed variable increase (1.5-3.2 fold increase). In the biochip array analysis, variable increase was noted. CRP (2.4 fold), D DIMER (11.6 fold), NSE (1.8 fold), NGAL (1.7 fold), TNFR1 (2 fold) and TM (1.3 fold) were all increased as compared to normal controls. All of the markers exhibited a decrease after warfarin treatment with a most pronounced decrease in the D Dimer and TNFR1. Conclusion(s): These results validate the hypothesis that SCLC patients exhibit a hypercoagulable state that is associated with simultaneous upregulation of inflammatory mediators. Warfarin treatment results in a down regulation of these mediators. Our results provide a rationale for prophylactic anticoagulant therapy in this group of patients.",Excluded

4298,"Late temporal lobe necrosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: evaluation with combined multi-section diffusion weighted and perfusion weighted MR imaging Late temporal lobe necrosis is a well-known and serious complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) following radiotherapy. Owing to the close proximity to the skull base, the medial temporal lobes are inevitably included in the target volume of irradiation. Patients with NPC provide a unique opportunity in study of delay radiation effect in normal human brain. The objective of this study was to evaluate late temporal lobe radiation injury by combined multi-section diffusion weighted and perfusion weighted MR imaging. We prospectively studied 16 patients with typical clinical symptoms of late temporal lobe necrosis or other abnormalities in the temporal lobes incidentally detected by conventional MR imaging. All patients had a previous history of radiotherapy for histologically proven NPC. Conventional T1- and T2-weighted images, fast gradient echo with echo-planar diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted MR imaging were performed. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) map were computed via commercially available software. MR diffusion and perfusion images were then analyzed and graded by two independent observers with focusing on the diffusion and perfusion mismatch. The temporal lobe lesions displayed marked high diffusion on the ADC map. The rCBV map also revealed marked hypoperfusion in these temporal lobe lesions in all patients. The areas of abnormality on the rCBV map were significantly larger than the lesions on the ADC map in 14 patients (observer 1) and 13 patients (observer 2). Since late temporal lobe necrosis is probably caused by damage of the endothelium of vessels and ischemia, perfusion and diffusion mismatch might imply injured tissue but potentially salvageable brain tissue. A mismatch may be potentially used to predict the response to treatment in-patients with late temporal lobe necrosis.",Excluded
4021,"Cholinergic responses in crossed tecto-reticular neurons of rat superior colliculus Neurons in the intermediate gray layer (SGI) of mammalian superior colliculus (SC) receive cholinergic innervation from the brain stem parabrachial region, which seems to modulate the signal processing in the SC. To clarify its role particularly in orienting behaviors, we studied cholinergic effects on the major output neuron group of the SGI, crossed tecto-reticular neurons (cTRNs), identified by retrograde labeling from the contralateral brain stem gaze center in SC slices obtained from rats (PND 17-22) by whole cell patch-clamp techniques. Bath application of carbachol induced either 1) nicotinic inward (nIN) + muscarinic inward (mIN) (11/24) or 2) nIN + mIN + muscarinic outward (mOUT) (13/24) current responses. Transient pressure application of 1 mM acetylcholine elicited nIN in all neurons tested (n = 58). In a majority of these neurons (52/58), the nIN was completely suppressed by dihydro-beta-erythroidine, a specific antagonist for alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor subtype. The remaining 6/58 neurons exhibited not only the slower alpha4beta2 receptor-mediated component but also a faster component that was inhibited by a specific antagonist for alpha7 nicotinic receptor, alpha-bungarotoxin. cTRNs expressing alpha7 nicotinic receptors tended to be smaller in size than those lacking alpha7 receptors. Bath application of muscarine induced two response patterns: mIN only (17/38) and mIN+ mOUT (21/38). The mIN and mOUT were mediated by M3 (plus M1) and M2 muscarinic receptors, respectively. These results suggest that a major response to cholinergic inputs to cTRNs is excitatory. This would indicate the facilitatory role of the brain stem cholinergic system in the execution of orienting behaviors including saccadic eye movements.",Excluded

Methods Cross-sectional, observational and quantitative study. Fourteen male individuals diagnosed with laryngeal cancer were submitted to exclusive chemoradiotherapy treatment. The individuals completed the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and the Swallowing Quality of Life (SWAL-QOL) questionnaires. Data were submitted to descriptive and inferential analysis using Spearman's Correlation Test to verify possible correlations among the scores of these instruments. Values of p <= 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results No significant correlation was found between the total VHI and overall SWAL-QOL scores.

3644,"Rapid activation of presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by nerve-released transmitter Nicotine's ability to enhance neurotransmitter release has implicated presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in synaptic modulation, but there aze few examples where presynaptic nAChRs are known to be activated by nerve-released transmitter. We searched for endogenous activation of presynaptic nAChRs in the calyceal nerve terminals of the chick ciliary ganglion by imaging presynaptic calcium transients using dextran-coupled indicator dyes. The amplitude of Ca(+)signals recorded in individual nerve terminals was frequency dependent over 2-50 Hz. Calcium transients evoked by stimulation of the preganglionic nerve were significantly reduced (approximately 10-15%) by the nonspecific nAChR antagonist d-tubocurarine (d-TC; 100 microM) and the alpha7-specific antagonist methyllycaconitine (20-50 nM) but were not affected by 10 microM dihydro-beta-erythroidine, which should inhibit several non-alpha7 nAChRs. Feedback was rapid and did not require a stimulation-dependent build-up of transmitter, as d-TC and MLA reduced the amplitude of the first calcium transient in a 2-Hz train. Choline is an agonist at alpha7 nAChRs but is not the sole agonist in this system, as inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by echothiophate failed to reduce calcium transients. These results show that nerve-released acetylcholine (ACh) feeds back onto presynaptic alpha7 nAChRs to enhance calcium signals within the terminal. This feedback may help maintain the high rate of transmission at this cholinergic synapse.",Excluded

For intracranial lesions, however, early evidence suggests that focal radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy may achieve high local control rates and limit radiation toxicity. This study examines the efficacy of treatment approaches in the management of CNS germinoma patients at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Methods. Seventy-nine patients who received primary treatment for germinoma between 1980 and 2010 at UCSF were identified and their charts reviewed. Primary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results. 29 patients were treated with XRT alone and 50 with XRT and chemotherapy. 22 patients received focal XRT, 32 received whole brain irradiation (WBI) and 9 received CSI. Field data was unrecoverable for 16 patients. 14 patients progressed and 8 died from disease. PFS rate at 5 years was 87.7% and OS rate at 5 years was 93.0%. Overall, focal XRT had significantly higher rates of disease progression compared to WBI or CSI (p - 0.047 and p - 0.008 respectively) and among patients who had solitary lesions, focal XRT and chemotherapy had significantly higher rates of disease progression (p - 0 .024) than WBI and chemotherapy.

Materials/Methods: We queried our institutional IRB-approved SBRT registry for the period 2004-2014 for any early stage SCLC patients with a minimum of 6 months follow up. All patients had biopsy proven disease and were deemed medically inoperable after tumor board review. Routine staging consisted of PET/CT and MRI brain scans only. The treatment model consisted of SBRT to the primary followed by adjuvant platinum based chemotherapy (CHT) and then prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). SBRT was delivered employing a stereotactic-specific LINAC with vacuum-bag based immobilization, abdominal compression, and infrared based X-ray positioning system+/- CBCT for image-guidance. Result(s): Of 747 definitively treated cancers over 10 years, 16 (2%) were SCLCs meeting study criteria. Patient characteristics revealed: median KPS was 80 (range 50-90), median age was 69 years (range 45-87), 50% of patients were female, median BMI was 28.2 (range 17.4-41.2). Tumor characteristics revealed: median tumor size was 3.25cm (range1.4-7.2), 4 (25%) tumors were ""central"" (per RTOG 0813 criteria), median PET-SUV<inf>max</inf> was 10.3 (range 2.8-21.1). Median time to SBRT from diagnosis was 2.1 months (range 0.6-6.7). SBRT schedules were: 60 Gy/3 fractions in 25%, 50 Gy/5 fractions in 68.75%, and 30 Gy/1 fractions in 6.25% of cases. Mean follow up was 15 months. Fifteen (94%) received at least 2 cycles CHT, 2 (12.5%) received CHT before SBRT. Nine patients (56%) received PCI and of the 7 (44%) that did not, 1 developed brain metastases prior, 1 refused, and 5 died of non-cancer issues before PCI . There was no grade 3 or higher toxicity; rate of grade 2 or less toxicity was 12.5%.

4395,"Changes in neocortical function in response to the direct action of optical radiation The action of optical radiation on neocortical bioelectrical activity and on a penicillin-induced epileptic focus was investigated.

On the basis of the writers' own results and data in the literature it is postulated that the mechanism of action of UV radiation on neocortical electrical activity is based on changes in permeability of neuronal membranes to Na and K ions and subsequent membrane depolarization, whereas the action of visible radiation leads to thermal injury to the neurons in the irradiated zone, inducing irreversible suppression of their activity and a decrease in amplitude of the EEG.",Excluded
4029,"Rapid enzymatic response to compensate UV radiation in copepods Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) causes physical damage to DNA, carboxylation of proteins and peroxidation of lipids in copepod crustaceans, ubiquitous and abundant secondary producers in most aquatic ecosystems. Copepod adaptations for long duration exposures include changes in behaviour, changes in pigmentation and ultimately changes in morphology. Adaptations to short-term exposures are little studied. Here we show that short-duration exposure to UVR causes the freshwater calanoid copepod, Eudiaptomus gracilis, to rapidly activate production of enzymes that prevent widespread collateral peroxidation (glutathione S-transferase, GST), that regulate apoptosis cell death (Caspase-3, Casp-3), and that facilitate neurotransmissions (cholinesterase-ChE). None of these enzyme systems is alone sufficient, but they act in concert to reduce the stress level of the organism.

NFI has been successfully applied in a number of animal disease models including cancer, arthritis, and stroke. Furthermore, several applications in humans have been described. NFI is widely available in research laboratories because it has a number of advantages: It uses non-ionizing radiation and requires comparably simple, inexpensive instrumentation, and easy to handle. Fluorochromes can be detected with high sensitivity, and image acquisition time is relatively short. Furthermore, a plethora of fluorescent imaging agents is available including unspecific, target-specific, and activatable imaging probes. With these probes, biological processes such as inflammation, cell death or enzyme activity, and many others can be visualized in living animals.

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of psPD following RT/TMZ and the effect of psPD on prognosis.MATERIALS/METHODS: All patients receiving RT/TMZ for newly diagnosed GBM were identified from a prospective database. Clinical and radiographic data were retrospectively reviewed. Early progression was defined as radiological progression (RECIST criteria) during or within eight weeks of completing RT/TMZ. Pseudoprogression was defined as early progression with subsequent disease stabilization, without salvage therapy, for at least six months from completion of RT/TMZ. The primary outcome was overall survival (Kaplan-Meier) and log rank analysis was used to compare groups.RESULTS: Out of 111 patients analyzed, 104 were evaluable for radiological response. Median age was 58 years and median follow-up 55 weeks. Early progression was confirmed in 26% and within this group 32% had psPD. Median survival for the whole cohort was 56.7 weeks [95% CI (51.0, 71.3)]. Median survival for patients with psPD was significantly higher than for patients with true early progression (124.9 weeks versus 36.0 weeks, p = 0.0286).CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one third of patients with early progression were found to have psPD which was associated with a favourable prognosis.

Each patient had both a planning CT and weekly repeated CT. Simulated plans that were generated by using the same beam configurations mapped to the repeated CT represented the actual delivered doses to the target volumes and OARs. An IMRT replanning was performed with the fifth week CT scan. Doses among the initial plan, the simulated plans and replanning were compared.RESULTS: There were no significant dosimetric differences in the gross tumour volume, clinical target volume (CTV) 1 or CTV2 for either the simulated plans or the replanning compared with the initial plan. Dosimetric variability of both parotid glands and the brain stem were unique to each individual, and doses to the spinal cord were always maintained within the limit. Replanning in the fifth week had significantly decreased the doses delivered to both parotids (p-values of the mean dose were 0.015 and 0.026 for the left and right parotid, respectively), whereas it did not reduce the doses to the brain stem and spinal cord. There was no relationship between dose variability and weight loss.CONCLUSIONS: There are no significant dose changes for target volumes and spinal cord, and doses to the brain stem and both parotid glands changed individually during NPC IMRT.

Treatment response was evaluated in terms of symptoms, neurologic status, and, in most cases, reduction of tumor on repeat myelography. At the completion of therapy, 92% of treated patients experienced pain relief and 67% had significant to complete improvement on neurologic examination. Thirty days after treatment, repeat myelography was performed in 40 of the 50 cases; compared with the initial findings immediately preceding radiation therapy (RT), the results of 58% of these studies had normalized completely, results were improved in 25%, and the results had not changed in 18%. The presence of a high-grade compression fracture of the vertebral body was an indicator of poor prognosis for tumor response on repeat myelography. The ability of a patient to walk before treatment and tumor response on repeat myelography were associated significantly with improved outcome of RT and with survival.

4558,"Metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) and primary tumor resection: A NCDB survival evaluation Introduction: The role of surgical resection of primary and non-primary site tumors in pNETs is still debated. Aim(s): To evaluate the impact of primary tumor and metastasis resection in patients (pts) with metastatic pNET utilizing the NCDB database from 2004-2014. Material(s) and Method(s): Pts with pathologically confirmed metastatic pNETs, complete survival data, and were alive >30 days after diagnosis were included (N=2560). Overall survival (OS) was analyzed utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves, and log-rank tests were used for comparison. Cox proportional hazards was performed to control for age, sex, race, grade, insurance, Charlson/Deyo Score, facility type and location, insurance, primary tumor location, tumor functional status, primary site(PSR), non-primary site(NPSR) and metastasis resection(MS), chemotherapy(CHT), radiation(RT), and year of diagnosis. Result(s): The cohort male to female ratio was 1.27. 839, 699, and 456 pts underwent PSR, NPSR, and MS respectively. The median OS was 34.3 months for the entire cohort (95% CI: 18.5-36.6), 76.6 for resected pancreatic tumors (95% CI: 71.3-86.4), and 20.4 for unresected pancreatic tumors (95% CI: 18.5-22.3), log-rank test <0.0001. In a multivariate analysis, low grade, age <60, body and tail location, and PSR, were favorable predictors for mortality. PSR HR 0.33 (p=<0.0001; 95% CI 0.26-0.42). NPSR, MS, CHT and RT were not correlated with prognosis. Conclusion(s): Patients with metastatic pNET may benefit from primary tumor resection, independently from CT or RT.",Excluded
4563,"Saturation of DNA repair measured by alkaline elution To determine whether the half-times (T1/2) of the DNA repair processes measured by alkaline elution increased in a dose-dependent manner, exponentially growing 9L/Ro rat brain tumor cells were irradiated with doses of 15-50 Gy, and their DNA repair kinetics was measured by alkaline elution. At 15 Gy, the DNA repair kinetics was biphasic with the fast phase having a T1/2 approximately 6 min and the slow phase having a T1/2 approximately 42 min. As the dose was increased to 50 Gy, the fast-phase T1/2 remained at approximately 6 min, but the slow-phase T1/2 increased to approximately 87 min. Although a dose-dependent increase in the T1/2 of the slow phase of DNA repair (saturation) was measured by alkaline elution, both the absolute value of the slow-phase T1/2 and the dependency of the slow-phase T1/2 on dose were less than those measured by alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation in zonal rotors with slow reorienting gradient capability. Thus these two techniques appear either to depend on different hydrodynamic properties of the DNA or to have different coefficients of dependency for the same hydrodynamic properties of the DNA. The lower sensitivity for detection of the dose dependency of DNA repair makes it unlikely that the alkaline elution technique will be useful for quantitatively relating the shape of mammalian cell survival curves to the doses at which saturation of a DNA repair process occurs.",Excluded

A comparative histoenzymatic analysis of sensitive neurons of the lumbar spinal nodes and of the caudal-mesenteric motor neurons has been carried out. The response of the metabolic processes in the sensitive neurons depends not so much on the type of action, as on adequacy of the parameters applied.

Peculiarities of the metabolic reactions in the sensitive and sympathetic neurons in response to the actions studied are discussed.",Excluded
4492,"Comparison of tumor volume delineation on magnetic resonance/ positron emission tomography versus standard computed tomography for head and neck cancer: Is there added value? Purpose/Objective(s): Computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are commonly used in head and neck radiation treatment planning. Combined MRI and PET (MR/PET) offers the advantage of simultaneous acquisition of multimodality biological information and possibly improved spatial resolution. In this study we assessed the added value of gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation on MR/PET compared to the standard practice of GTV delineation on CT. Materials/Methods: We prospectively enrolled patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with chemoradiation therapy in an institutional review board-approved study. We performed 2 pretreatment scans: contrast-enhanced planning CT and gadolinium-enhanced MR/PET. Primary and nodal CT-based GTVs (GTV-CT) were delineated on planning CT scans. Treatments were delivered based on these volumes. Primary and nodal MR/PET-based tumor volumes were delineated retrospectively after treatment completion using anatomic MRI and metabolic PET information to form a biologic tumor volume (MRBTV). MRBTVs were delineated without knowledge of the GTV-CT (BM, AF). Accuracy of MRBTV contours was assessed by a neuroradiologist (BH). MR/PET scans were registered to planning CT scans and the MRBTV was transferred. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), a validated metric to evaluate spatial overlap, was calculated from the intersection and union of the GTV-CT (planning CT) and MRBTV (MR/PET). A DSC of 0.7 or greater was considered a ""good"" overlap. Doses received by the GTV-CT and MRBTV were compared. Result(s): Twelve patients completed a pretreatment planning CT and MR/PET. Primary disease site was oropharynx in 11 patients and larynx in 1 patient. Ten pts had evaluable primary tumor GTVs and 8 had evaluable nodal GTVs. For the primary GTV, mean GTV-CT was 12.9 mL and MRBTV was 13.3 mL. Mean primary GTV/BTV intersection was 8.1 mL, with a Dice ratio of 0.4. Dose received by at least 95% of the tumor volume (D95%) was 65.8 Gy for the primary GTV-CT versus 65.7 Gy for the primary MRBTV. For the nodal GTV, mean GTV-CT was 29.7 mL and MRBTV was 29.2 mL. Mean nodal MRBTV intersection was 19.7 mL with a Dice ratio of 0.5. D95% was 62.9 Gy for the nodal GTV-CT versus 61 Gy for the nodal MRBTV. Conclusion(s): MRBTV volumes were similar to GTV-CT but the spatial overlap was moderate. Despite only moderate spatial overlap, radiation dose received by the MRBTV was similar to that received by the GTV-CT. Most patients in our study had oropharyngeal primaries, for which the added sophistication of MRPET may not improve the quality of GTV delineation. MR/PET may show added value for primary tumors that are more difficult to delineate on CT, such as sinonasal, nasopharyngeal, and base of skull tumors.",Excluded
4414,"Head and neck tumor cell radiation response occurs in the presence of IGF1 Radiation therapy for head and neck cancer results in severe secondary side-effects in salivary glands. We previously demonstrated that the administration of IGF1 preserves or restores salivary gland function following radiation. Based on these findings, we propose to study the effect of IGF1 on human head and neck carcinoma cells. Head and neck tumor cells treated with radiation have significant reductions in tumor cell survival, as measured by MTT and crystal violet assays, regardless of IGF1 pre-treatment. Head and neck squamous carcinoma cell xenografts treated with concurrent radiation+IGF1 also exhibit significant tumor growth delay; however, growth rates are elevated compared with those in irradiated xenografts. In contrast, administration of IGF1 after radiation treatment has no effect on tumor xenograft growth rates. Analysis of these data suggests that localized delivery may be required for concurrent therapy to prevent secondary side-effects of radiotherapy, while post-therapy administration of IGF1 could be considered for the restoration of salivary function.",Excluded

In this study, we analysed the treatment parameters and outcomes of our cranial meningioma patients treated with SRT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013, 103 cranial meningioma lesions of 93 patients were treated with CyberKnife (Accurayw) Stereotactic Radiosurgery Unit. 42 patients (45%) received SRT as primary modality, and 51 patients ( 55 %) received postoperatively. Six patients have treated with external beam radiotherapy. Of the 103 cases, 69 of the lesions were located basally, 34 of them nonbasally. The most common symptoms in patients with basal tumours (38 patients, 58%) was detoriation in the visual field and the restriction of the eye movements and in patients with non-basal tumours (8 patients, 26%) was headache. In 33 patients (32%) tumours were located just adjacent to the optic apparatus or brain stem, 27 of them (26%) were located close (<1cm) to the optic apparatus or brain stem. SRT dose and fractionation were determined according to tumor localization. Optical apparatus and brainstem maximum point dose constraints for one fraction were 10 Gy and 14 Gy; 25 Gy and 30 Gy were for 5 fractions. RESULT(S): The median age was 44 (16-81). The female to male ratio was 73/20 (3.6/1). Median follow-up was 10 months (1-37 months). The median dose was 2500cGy (1500 - 3000 cGy). The median number of fraction was5 (1-5 fractions) fraction.GTVvolume ranged between 0.66cm3and 80.6 cm3 (Median 12.4 cm3). Median conformity index was 1.4 (1.06 to 2.03) and the median homogeneity index was 1.25 (1.09 to 1.56). Among the patients with follow up, local control rate was 98%. Only one patient with parasagittal meningioma underwent decompressive surgery due to radiation induced edema. All other side effects were either grade I or II. The most common side effect was headache associated with brain edema in 10 patients (11%). CONCLUSION(S): Hypofractionated SRT is an effective treatment method in patients with cranial meningiomas with excellent rate of local control and minimal side effects.",Excluded

4375,"Evaluation of radiochromic gel dosimetry and polymer gel dosimetry in a clinical dose verification A quantitative comparison of two full three-dimensional (3D) gel dosimetry techniques was assessed in a clinical setting: radiochromic gel dosimetry with an in-house developed optical laser CT scanner and polymer gel dosimetry with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To benchmark both gel dosimeters, they were exposed to a 6 MV photon beam and the depth dose was compared against a diamond detector measurement that served as golden standard. Both gel dosimeters were found accurate within 4% accuracy. In the 3D dose matrix of the radiochromic gel, hotspot dose deviations up to 8% were observed which are attributed to the fabrication procedure. The polymer gel readout was shown to be sensitive to B0 field and B1 field non-uniformities as well as temperature variations during scanning. The performance of the two gel dosimeters was also evaluated for a brain tumour IMRT treatment. Both gel measured dose distributions were compared against treatment planning system predicted dose maps which were validated independently with ion chamber measurements and portal dosimetry. In the radiochromic gel measurement, two sources of deviations could be identified. Firstly, the dose in a cluster of voxels near the edge of the phantom deviated from the planned dose. Secondly, the presence of dose hotspots in the order of 10% related to inhomogeneities in the gel limit the clinical acceptance of this dosimetry technique. Based on the results of the micelle gel dosimeter prototype presented here, chemical optimization will be subject of future work. Polymer gel dosimetry is capable of measuring the absolute dose in the whole 3D volume within 5% accuracy. A temperature stabilization technique is incorporated to increase the accuracy during short measurements, however keeping the temperature stable during long measurement times in both calibration phantoms and the volumetric phantom is more challenging. The sensitivity of MRI readout to minimal temperature fluctuations is demonstrated which proves the need for adequate compensation strategies.",Excluded

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed no plasmacytosis and although there was a raised CSF protein concentration, no paraprotein band was detected, despite the presence of serum paraprotein. The infiltration of the dura mater is likely to have arisen by spread from contiguous bone lesions, contrasting with the pattern of spread seen in myelomatous involvement of the leptomeninges, which probably occurs through haematogenous seeding of the meninges. Leptomeningeal involvement is associated with a very poor prognosis; however, this patient had a favourable response to combined chemotherapy and cranial radiotherapy, suggesting that myelomatous involvement of the dura mater should be considered as a distinct complication of myeloma.",Excluded
4411,"The H reflex from the abductor brevis hallucis muscle in healthy subjects In order to evaluate the clinical applicability of a neurophysiological technique, information is required about the effect of technical and subjective factors on the measured parameters, and whether these measures are reliable. The reliability of measurement of a given parameter is inversely related to the variability shown by a set of measurements of that parameter made on the same subject under similar conditions. Reliable measures are fundamental to the clinical utility of any technique. We evaluated the reliability using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and assessed both single-point and test-retest normal limits for H-reflex parameters of abductor brevis hallucis (ABH). The H reflex from the ABH muscle was recorded in 36 of 43 subjects, but could not be elicited in 7 of 11 subjects who were >60 years of age. The Hmax latency increased as height increased, whereas Hmax amplitude and Hmax/Mmax amplitude ratio decreased as age and height increased.

3719,"Correlation between fissured fibrous cap and contrast enhancement: preliminary results with the use of CTA and histologic validation BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies demonstrated that carotid plaques analyzed by CTA can show contrast plaque enhancement. The purpose of this preliminary work was to evaluate the possible association between the fissured fibrous cap and contrast plaque enhancement.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven consecutive (men = 25; average age = 66.8 +/- 9 years) symptomatic patients studied by use of a multidetector row CT scanner were prospectively analyzed. CTA was performed before and after contrast and radiation doses were recorded; analysis of contrast plaque enhancement was performed. Patients underwent carotid endarterectomy en bloc; histologic sections were prepared and evaluated for fissured fibrous cap and microvessel attenuation. The Mann-Whitney test was performed to evaluate the differences between the 2 groups. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of fissured fibrous cap and microvessel attenuation on contrast plaque enhancement. Receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were also calculated.RESULTS: Twelve patients had fissured fibrous cap. In 92% (11/12) of fissured fibrous cap-positive plaques, we found contrast plaque enhancement, whereas in 69% (24/35) of the plaques without fissured fibrous cap contrast plaque enhancement was found. The Mann-Whitney test showed a statistically significant difference between the contrast enhancement in plaques with fissured fibrous cap (Hounsfield units = 22.6) and without fissured fibrous cap (Hounsfield units = 12.9) (P = .011). On the regression analysis, both fissured fibrous cap and neovascularization were associated with contrast plaque enhancement (P = .0366 and P = .0001). The receiver operating characteristic curve confirmed an association between fissured fibrous cap and contrast plaque enhancement with an area under the curve of 0.749 (P = .005).CONCLUSIONS: The presence of fissured fibrous cap is associated with contrast plaque enhancement. Histologic analysis showed that the presence of fissured fibrous cap is associated with a larger contrast plaque enhancement compared with the contrast plaque enhancement of plaques without fissured fibrous cap.",Excluded
4725,"Alterations in uptake and release rates for GABA, glutamate, and glutamine during biochemical maturation of highly purified cultures of cerebral cortical neurons, a GABAergic preparation This study demonstrates that virtually homogenous cultures of mouse cerebral neurons, obtained from 15-day-old embryos, differentiate at least as well as cultures which in addition contain astrocytes. This was indicated by glutamate decarboxylase activity which within 2 weeks rose from a negligible value to twice the level in the adult mouse cerebral cortex, and by a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake rate which quadrupled during the second week in culture and reached higher values than in brain slices. Within the same period, the GABA content increased four to five times to 75 nmol/mg protein, and a potassium-induced increase in [<sup>14</sup>C]GABA efflux became apparent. Although the development was faster than in vivo, optimum differentiation required maintenance of the cultures beyong the age of 1 week. Uptake and release rates for glutamate and glutamine underwent much less developmental alteration. At no time was there any potassium-induced release of radioactivity after exposure to [<sup>14</sup>C]glutamate, and the glutamate uptake was only slightly increased during the period of GABAergic development. This indicates that exogenous glutamate is not an important GABA precursor. Similarly, glutamine uptake was unaltered between days 7 and 14, although a small potassium-induced release of radioactivity after loading with glutamine suggests a partial conversion to GABA.",Excluded
4094,"Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7, mda-7/IL-24, selectively induces growth suppression, apoptosis and radiosensitization in malignant gliomas in a p53-independent manner Malignant gliomas are extremely aggressive cancers currently lacking effective treatment modalities. Gene therapy represents a promising approach for this disease. A requisite component for improving gene-based therapies of brain cancer includes tumor suppressor genes that exhibit cancer constrained inhibitory activity. Subtraction hybridization identified melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (mda-7) as a gene associated with melanoma cell growth, differentiation and progression. Ectopic expression of mda-7 by means of a replication-incompetent adenovirus (Ad), Ad.mda-7, induces growth suppression and apoptosis selectively in diverse human cancers, without producing any apparent harmful effect in normal cells. We presently demonstrate that Ad.mda-7 induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in malignant human gliomas expressing both mutant and wild-type p53, and these effects correlate with an elevation in expression of members of the growth arrest and DNA damage (GADD) gene family. In contrast, infection with a recombinant Ad expressing wild-type p53, Ad.wtp53, specifically affects mutant p53 expressing gliomas. When tested in early passage normal and immortal human fetal astrocytes, growth inhibition resulting from infection with Ad.mda-7 or Ad.wtp53 is significantly less than in malignant gliomas and no toxicity is evident in these normal cells. Moreover, infection of gliomas with Ad.mda-7 or treatment with purified GST-MDA-7 protein sensitizes both wild-type and mutant p53 expressing tumor cells to the growth inhibitory and antisurvival effects of ionizing radiation, and this response correlates with increased expression of specific members of the GADD gene family. Since heterogeneity in p53 expression is common in evolving gliomas, the present findings suggest that Ad.mda-7 may, in many instances, prove more beneficial for the gene-based therapy of malignant gliomas than administration of wild-type p53.",Excluded

A group of combined surgery (removal of an AVM with preoperative embolization) consisted of 40 patients, and a group of combined radiotherapy (radiation after partial embolization or partial removal of an AVM) included 53 patients. 36 patients underwent radiosurgery, and 17 patients received stereotactic radiation therapy. Both groups were analyzed in terms of outcomes, complications, and follow-up results.RESULTS: In the group of combined surgery, according to the Glasgow outcome scale, good results (grade 4-5) were achieved in 35 (87.5%) patients at discharge and in 27 (90%) patients during follow-up. Treatment outcomes, surgery duration, and the amount of blood loss were not significantly different from those in the control group.

Reasoning that activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) contributes to radiation resistance, we undertook a phase II trial of the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib with whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in an attempt to extend survival time for patients with BM from NSCLC. Additional end points were radiologic response and safety. Patients and Methods Eligible patients hadBMfrom NSCLC, regardless of EGFR status. Erlotinib was given at 150 mg orally once per day for 1 week, then concurrently with WBRT (2.5 Gy per day 5 days per week, to 35 Gy), followed by maintenance. EGFR mutation status was tested by DNA sequencing at an accredited core facility. Results Forty patients were enrolled and completed erlotinib plus WBRT (median age, 59 years; median diagnosis-specific graded prognostic assessment score, 1.5). The overall response rate was 86% (n = 36). No increase in neurotoxicity was detected, and no patient experienced grade >= 4 toxicity, but three patients required dose reduction for grade 3 rash. At a median follow-up of 28.5 months (for living patients), median survival time was 11.8 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 19.1 months). Of 17 patients with known EGFR status, median survival time was 9.3 months for those with wild-type EGFR and 19.1 months for those with EGFR mutations. Conclusion Erlotinib was well tolerated in combination with WBRT, with a favorable objective response rate. The higher-than-expected rate of EGFR mutations in these unselected patients raises the possibility that EGFR-mutated tumors are prone to brain dissemination. © 2013 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
3708,"Small-cell lung cancer: Clinical management and unmet needs new perspectives for an old problem Small cell lung cancer is a highly aggressive, difficult to treat neoplasm. Among all lung tumors, small cell lung cancers account for about 20%. Patients typically include heavy smokers in 70s age group, presenting with symptoms such as intrathoracic tumors growth, distant spread or paraneoplastic syndromes at the time of diagnosis. A useful and functional classification divides small cell lung cancers into limited disease and extensive disease. Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy is the standard treatment for limited disease, with improved survival when combined with prophylactic cranial irradiation. Platinum compounds (cisplatin/carboplatin) plus etoposide remain the cornerstone for extensive disease. Nevertheless, despite high chemoand radio-sensitivity of this cancer, nearly all patients relapse within the first two years and the prognosis is extremely poor.

4095,"Targeting CREB inhibits radiation-induced neuroendocrine differentiation and increases radiation-induced cell death in prostate cancer cells Neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) is a process by which prostate cancer cells transdifferentiate into neuroendocrine-like (NE-like) cancer cells. Accumulated evidence suggests that NED is associated with disease progression and therapy resistance in prostate cancer patients. We previously reported that by mimicking a clinical radiotherapy protocol, fractionated ionizing radiation (FIR) induces NED in prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, FIR-induced NED constitutes two distinct phases: a radioresistance phase in which a fraction of cells selectively survive during the first two week irradiation, and a neuroendocrine differentiation phase in which surviving cells differentiate into NE-like cancer cells during the second two week irradiation. We have also observed increased activation of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein during the course of FIR-induced NED. To determine whether targeting NED can be explored as a radiosensitization approach, we employed two CREB targeting strategies, CREB knockdown and overexpression of ACREB, a dominant-negative mutant of CREB, to target both phases. Our results showed that ACREB expression increased FIR-induced cell death and sensitized prostate cancer cells to radiation. Consistent with this, knockdown of CREB also inhibited FIR-induced NED and sensitized prostate cancer cells to radiation. Molecular analysis suggests that CREB targeting primarily increases radiation-induced pre-mitotic apoptosis. Taken together, our results suggest that targeting NED could be developed as a radiosensitization approach for prostate cancer radiotherapy.",Excluded

Therefore, different concepts are under discussion without a uniform standard of therapy and diagnostics. Material(s) and Method(s): We evaluated all spinal ependymomas treated surgically from 03/2006 until 05/2012 at our department. This consecutive, retrospective series includes 41 patients: 23 female, 18 male, median age 51 y. (range 21-80). 22 Ependymomas were located intramedullary, 18 within cauda equina or filum terminale, 1 patient presented with multifocal spinal lesions including both, intramedullar and extramedullar lesions. Perioperative standard diagnostic of most tumors included a holospinal MRI and a CSF cytology. First follow-up MRI and exam was done 3 months postoperatively, further controls every year in case of stable findings. Current median follow-up is 29 months (range 3-72). Preoperative, early postoperative and follow-up clinical performance was evaluated according to the modified McCormick scale. Postoperative deterioration was dichotomized in ""slight"" (=deterioration without any increase of the modified McCormick scale grades or an increase in only one grade within the scale range 1-2) and ""significant"" (=increase to grade 7ge;3 on the modified McCormick scale). Result(s): Preoperatively, the vast majority presented neurologically intact or with mild deficits maintaining functional independence according to the modified McCormick scale. The most common preoperative symptom was pain (78%), followed by sensory deficits (54%), gait ataxia (34%), motor deficits (27%), and bowel/bladder dysfunction (12%). In only one patient the ependymoma was found incidentally. Gross total resection (GTR) could be achieved in 85% (n=35) (subtotal resection n=5, debulking of the main tumor mass of a multifocal disease n=1). Histology: the majority were WHO IIdegree (n=30), 10 WHOdegreeI tumours, 1 case of anaplastic ependymoma WHOdegreeIII. Immediately after surgery 24% (n=10) showed worsening of neurological symptoms, but in most cases only mild new deficits occurred. During follow up 78% (n=32) showed at least preop status, 37% (n=15) improved. In only 5% (n=2) a permanent significant deterioration remained. Adjuvant radiotherapy was performed after the first surgery in two cases: in one patient with drop metastasis after the GTR of the main tumour, and in another patient with multifocal lesions after debulking, both were WHOdegreeII ependymomas. Tumour recurrence was seen in 4 cases, so far: 3 WHOdegreeII, 1 WHOdegreeI, 2 of them despite previous GTR and 1 despite adjuvant radiation. Median progression free survival was 22 months (range 6-43). 2 patients died of meningeosis 19 and 31 months after the initial diagnosis, respectively. Conclusion(s): Gross-total resection still stays the main column of ependymoma therapy. In our series this could be achieved in 85% accompanied by a rate of 5% for significant persistent deficits. In cases of incomplete resection stereotactic radiotherapy as well as a wait and see srategy can be considered. In case of disseminated disease holospinal radiation with a boost to the primary tumour site is recommended.

In this report, we present a novel technique, which selectively targets oligodendrocytes within the spinal cord of transgenic mice to produce focal demyelination. Transgenic mice expressing the E. coli LacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene from the myelin basic protein promotor allowed for oligodendrocyte-specific cleavage of topically applied fluorescein-di-beta-galactopyranoside liberating photoactivatable fluorescein. Subsequent fluorescence illumination generated oxygen radicals that oxidized a second exogenous substrate, 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole, to form a toxic precipitate within oligodendrocytes. Histochemical staining of the spinal cord dorsal columns 8 days following phototargeting revealed that the treated region no longer contained beta-galactosidase-positive cells. Focal demyelination of the dorsal columns was observed to a depth of 150 microm in transverse semithin plastic sections. Numerous bundles of naked axons interspersed with myelin, debris-laden macrophages, and reactive astrocytes were evident by electron microscopy. Remyelination of axons by both oligodendrocytes and invading Schwann cells was observed within the treated region 14 days after phototargeting. Newly generated oligodendrocytes were identified within the demyelinated region by their incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine. Thus, this novel focal demyelination protocol provides: (1) a method for selective targeted ablation of oligodendrocytes in vivo, (2) control over the extent of the demyelinated region, with (3) an environment that maintains its remyelination capacity. Phototargeted ablation of oligodendrocytes may therefore be a useful model for studying axon-glia interactions, axon regeneration within a demyelinated zone, and remyelination of axons.",Excluded
4815,"Contribution to the pathogenesis of radiation-induced injury to large arteries We report a case of a 35-year-old man who died of a brain infarct 20 months after radiotherapy for carcinoma of the tonsil with metastases to the cervical lymph nodes. Histology revealed mild atherosclerosis, necrotizing vasculitis, and occlusive thrombosis of the internal carotid artery. Significant changes were observed in the vasa vasorum: swelling and detachment of the endothelium, subendothelial oedema, hyaline change, fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls with mononuclear cellular infiltration, accompanied by focal haemorrhages and chronic inflammation in the periadventitial soft tissue. We believe that these changes of the vasa vasorum and necrotizing vasculitis are causally related and that vasculitis represents focal ischaemic necroses with inflammatory reaction. Our findings support the hypothesis, based on experimental studies, that injury to the vasa vasorum is an important mechanism in the development of radiation-induced vasculopathy of large arteries. They also suggest an evolution of the injury to the vasa vasorum and periadventitial tissue from the early lesions described in our patient, to late stages resulting in dense periadventitial fibrosis as reported previously. We suggest that injury to the vasa vasorum and the consequent ischaemic lesions of the arterial wall are morphological features distinguishing radiation-induced arterial injury from spontaneous atherosclerosis.",Excluded

4614,"Analyzing the response to metabolic therapy in a mouse model of malignant glioma using multimodality imaging The ketogenic diet (KD) is a therapeutic high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that alters metabolism by increasing the level of ketone bodies in the blood. We have used a bioluminescent intracranial mouse model of malignant glioma and the IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, a PerkinElmer Co, Hopkinton, MA) to demonstrate that a rodent ketogenic diet given ad libitum increases blood ketones without altering animal weight or overall blood glucose levels. Animals maintained on a KD have extended survival following tumor implantation, and the KD potentiates the therapeutic effects of radiation and chemotherapy. We previously demonstrated in vivo that these tumors cause a local increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), but the KD reduced ROS in the tumor when quantitatively analyzed ex vivo. We now hypothesize that ketosis, which is known to have a neuroprotective effect in various diseases, may also reduce peritumoral edema and/or inflammation. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is a known mediator of inflammation, and expression profiling analysis showed that animals maintained on a SD have a significant increase in expression of the gene encoding COX-2 in their tumor, while animals maintained on KD showed no such increase. MRI analyses using a Bruker Biospec 70/30 MRI (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Freemont, CA) showed that animals fed KD also have a significant reduction in peritumoral edema. We previously demonstrated that commercially available fluorescent probes such as AngioSense 680 EX (PerkinElmer, Inc.) can be used in concert with in vivo imaging of tumor bioluminescence to demonstrate vascular permeability that can lead to increased peritumoral edema. We are now using the XenoLight RediJect COX-2 fluorescent probe (PerkinElmer, Inc) and the AngioSense 680 EX fluorescent probe in combination with the bioluminescent indication of tumor size and MRI analyses of tumor size and peritumoral edema.

By selectively affecting large or small fibres, some sensory neuropathies may also provoke a dissociated sensory loss. Standard nerve conduction studies and somatosensory evoked potentials assess Abeta-fibre function only. Laser pulses selectively excite free nerve endings in the superficial skin layers and evoke Adelta-related brain potentials (LEPs). From earlier studies and new cases we collected data on 270 patients with sensory neuropathy. LEPs often disclosed subclinical dysfunction of Adelta fibres and proved a sensitive and reliable diagnostic tool for assessing small-fibre function in sensory neuropathy. [References: 24]",Excluded
4463,"Monkey, rat, and first in human evaluation of [<sup>18</sup>F]PF- 06445974, a PET radioligand that preferentially labels phosphodiesterase 4B Introduction: Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) metabolizes and terminates the actions of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 has four isozymes: A, B, C, and D. PDE4B and PDE4D have the highest expression in brain and are linked to cognitive deficits as well as major depressive disorder (MDD). This PET study assessed the newly developed PDE4B-selective radioligand [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 in rats, rhesus monkeys and, for the first time, humans. A concomitant goal was to determine whether [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 could accurately quantify PDE4 in human brain. Method(s): In two human subjects, two whole body PET scans for radiation exposure dosimetry and three brain PET scans for specific PDE4B quantification were performed. In the pharmacokinetic analysis, target enzyme density was quantified as total distribution volume (V ) using the two-tissue compartment model and serial concentrations of parent radioligand in arterial plasma. In one male rhesus monkey, four PET whole body scans were performed on different days. The first scan was acquired under baseline conditions, and rolipram (1.0 mg/kg), a PDE4 inhibitor, was administered IV in the second scan. The same baseline and blocked paradigms were repeated with PF- 06445974 (0.1 mg/kg) as the blocking drug. Finally, brain PET scans were conducted in four rats. Concentration of radioactivity as standardized uptake value (SUV) was compared across conditions and species. Result(s): [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 readily entered human brain and showed widespread distribution, with lower binding in cerebellum. V was well identified in all examined brain regions, and V calculated from the first 90 min of scan data fell within 10%. V was highest in thalamus and striatum, broadly matching human brain RNA expression. Wholebody imaging in the two humans and one monkey was notable for early distribution in the blood pool, accumulation in target organs (i.e., brain, lung), and excretion via urinary tract. Doses in the two humans were 19.6 and 19.3 muSV/MBq, respectively, similar to the value extrapolated from monkey (16.5 muSv/MBq). In monkey blocking scans, both drugs substantially blocked brain uptake; at 60 min, rolipram blocked 78% of uptake and PF-06445974 blocked 92%. However, for the rolipram-blocked scan, radioactivity in brain increased after 20 min and returned to baseline by the end of the scan. Rats showed a similar pattern to monkey. To assess whether this was due to radiometabolite in brain or rapid rolipram clearance, a second rolipram dose was injected as a displacing agent at 120 min in a rat that had undergone pre-injection of 1 mg/kg iv. This repeat rolipram dose replenished rolipram concentrations in brain and restored its ability to block radioligand binding, proving that no radiometabolite entered rat or monkey brain. Conclusion(s): [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 successfully imaged and quantified PDE4B in human brain. No radiometabolite contamination occurred, reflecting parent radioligand binding to PDE4 in brain. In nonhuman primates,, rolipram washed out more quickly than PF-06445974. Fig.1 In human brain, [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 had widespread distribution, with high uptake in striatum and thalamus.

3779,"Comparative studies on the late bleaching processes of four kinds of cone visual pigments and rod visual pigment Visual pigments in rod and cone photoreceptor cells of vertebrate retinas are highly diversified photoreceptive proteins that consist of a protein moiety opsin and a light-absorbing chromophore 11-cis-retinal. There are four types of cone visual pigments and a single type of rod visual pigment. The reaction process of the rod visual pigment, rhodopsin, has been extensively investigated, whereas there have been few studies of cone visual pigments. Here we comprehensively investigated the reaction processes of cone visual pigments on a time scale of milliseconds to minutes, using flash photolysis equipment optimized for cone visual pigment photochemistry. We used chicken violet (L-group), chicken blue (M1-group), chicken green (M2-group), and monkey green (L-group) visual pigments as representatives of the respective groups of the phylogenetic tree of cone pigments. The S, M1, and M2 pigments showed the formation of a pH-dependent mixture of meta intermediates, similar to that formed from rhodopsin. Although monkey green (L-group) also formed a mixture of meta intermediates, pH dependency of meta intermediates was not observed. However, meta intermediates of monkey green became pH dependent when the chloride ion bound to the monkey green was replaced with a nitrate ion. These results strongly suggest that rhodopsin and S, M1, and M2 cone visual pigments share a molecular mechanism for activation, whereas the L-group pigment may have a special reaction mechanism involving the chloride-binding site.",Excluded

3980,"Radiotherapeutic management of vestibular schwannomas using size- and location-adapted fractionation regimens to maximize the therapeutic ratio BACKGROUND: We evaluated and compared the radiographic and clinical outcomes of patients with vestibular schwannomas treated with single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), 5 fractions of hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (hSRT), or 25 to 30 fractions of conventionally fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (cfSRT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-six patients treated with LINAC-based SRS (median, 12.5 Gy), hSRT (25 Gy), or cfSRT (median, 54 Gy) were retrospectively reviewed. Fractionation was based on the size of the tumor, proximity to the brainstem, and potential risk of neurological sequelae. Median follow-up time was 55.2 months.RESULTS: The pretreatment median tumor diameter was significantly smaller for SRS (1.14 cm) compared with hSRT (1.7 cm) (P = .03) and cfSRT (2.0 cm) (P < .001). The overall local tumor control was 96.4%: 100% SRS, 100% hSRT, and 90% cfSRT (P = .19). Tumor regression was observed in 53.3% of SRS, 76.2% of hSRT, and 90% of cfSRT (P = .05). There was less transient expansion of tumors treated with cfSRT (5%) than with SRS (53.3%) or hSRT (28.6%) (P = .005). The median time to regression was 13.8 months for SRS, 14.2 months for hSRT, and 5.5 months for cfSRT (P = .34). There was a 3.6% incidence of grade 3 trigeminal neuropathy, but there was no grade 3 facial neuropathy.CONCLUSIONS: All 3 regimens demonstrated similar excellent local control with minimal toxicity; however, the ability of hSRT to treat larger tumors with comparable outcomes to SRS and greater patient convenience when compared with cfSRT suggest that hSRT may offer the optimal treatment approach.",Excluded
3809,"Intrinsic and extrinsic light responses in melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells during mouse development Melanopsin (Opn4) is a photopigment found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that project to various brain areas. These neurons are intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs) and are implicated in nonimage-forming responses to environmental light such as the pupillary light reflex and circadian entrainment. Recent evidence indicates that ipRGCs respond to light at birth, but questions remain as to whether and when they undergo significant functional changes. We used bacterial artificial chromosome transgenesis to engineer a mouse line in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is expressed under the control of the melanopsin promoter. Double immunolabeling for EGFP and melanopsin demonstrates their colocalization in ganglion cells of mutant mouse retinas. Electrophysiological recordings of ipRGCs in neonatal mice (postnatal day 0 [P0] to P7) demonstrated that these cells responded to light with small and sluggish depolarization. However, starting at P11 we observed ipRGCs that responded to light with a larger and faster onset (<1 s) and offset (<1 s) depolarization. These faster, larger depolarizations were observed in most ipRGCs by early adult ages. However, on application of a cocktail of synaptic blockers, we found that all cells responded to light with slow onset (>2.5 s) and offset (>10 s) depolarization, revealing the intrinsic, melanopsin-mediated light responses. The extrinsic, cone/rod influence on ipRGCs correlates with their extensive dendritic stratification in the inner plexiform layer. Collectively, these results demonstrate that ipRGCs make use of melanopsin for phototransduction before eye opening and that these cells further integrate signals derived from the outer retina as the retina matures.",Excluded

In this study we compared these agents in terms of radiation doses and fluoroscopy times. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation exposure of patients treated with Onyx to the radation exposure of those treated with nBCA on a per embolization basis. Method(s): The study group consisted of 34 patients that were embolized at the Leiden University Medical Center. Patients were assigned to two groups, Group I consisting of patients that had received Onyx embolization and Group II consisting of patients that had received nBCA embolization. The patient groups were matched for age, AVM characteristics and the number of embolizations. Cohorts were compared by PA radiation dose and lateral radiation dose. Result(s): A total of 44 embolizations were performed on 34 patients (Onyx, 17 patients and 22 embolizations; nBCA, 17 patients and 22 embolizations).

Result(s): 60 pts presented with low grade GG and 7 with anaplastic GG. The median age at diagnosis was 27 years (18-59). 22 pts developed recurrent disease (18 low grade and 4 high grade) with a median time to recurrence of 87 weeks from surgery. 7 of the pts with low grade GG had malignant transformation to a malignant tumor (anaplastic GG or GBM). 22 pts received radiation therapy, 16 at diagnosis. 14 pts received chemotherapy at recurrence. Pts with incomplete resections or higher grade tumors were more likely to receive chemotherapy or radiation. The median overall survival (OS) time for these pts was not reached with a median follow-up time of 4.6 years. The 2-, 5- and 10-year OS were 98%, 87%, and 76%. Factors on univariate analysis that were significantly associated with OS were KPS at presentation (HR 10.1; 95% CI 2.6, 39.1; p = 0.0008), extent of resection (EOR) (biopsy vs gross total; HR 12.1; 95% CI 2.3, 63.6; p = 0.003), histologic grade (Grade 1-2 vs Grade 3-4; HR 0.06; 95% CI 0.01, 0.3; p = 0.0002), and seizure control following surgery (Engel I vs Engel 2-3; HR 0.1; 95% CI 0.01, 0.9; p = 0.02).

3989,"Perception of sniff phase in mouse olfaction Olfactory systems encode odours by which neurons respond and by when they respond. In mammals, every sniff evokes a precise, odour-specific sequence of activity across olfactory neurons. Likewise, in a variety of neural systems, ranging from sensory periphery to cognitive centres, neuronal activity is timed relative to sampling behaviour and/or internally generated oscillations. As in these neural systems, relative timing of activity may represent information in the olfactory system. However, there is no evidence that mammalian olfactory systems read such cues. To test whether mice perceive the timing of olfactory activation relative to the sniff cycle ('sniff phase'), we used optogenetics in gene-targeted mice to generate spatially constant, temporally controllable olfactory input. Here we show that mice can behaviourally report the sniff phase of optogenetically driven activation of olfactory sensory neurons. Furthermore, mice can discriminate between light-evoked inputs that are shifted in the sniff cycle by as little as 10 milliseconds, which is similar to the temporal precision of olfactory bulb odour responses. Electrophysiological recordings in the olfactory bulb of awake mice show that individual cells encode the timing of photoactivation in relation to the sniff in both the timing and the amplitude of their responses. Our work provides evidence that the mammalian olfactory system can read temporal patterns, and suggests that timing of activity relative to sampling behaviour is a potent cue that may enable accurate olfactory percepts to form quickly.",Excluded

3643,"Exposure to different wavelengths of light and the development of structural and functional asymmetries in the chicken The thalamofugal visual projections of the chick are known to develop in response to stimulation by light prior to hatching, and asymmetry in the number of projections develops as a consequence of the embryo being oriented in the egg so that it occuludes its left eye. The right eye only is stimulated by light and this causes the visual projections connected to the right eye to develop in advance of those connected to the left. We have now found that exposure of embryos, from day 19 of incubation to hatching, to red (peak transmission at 670 nm) or green (peak at 500 nm) light is as effective as broad-spectrum (white) light in establishing asymmetry in these projections. The intensities of the light to which the embryos were exposed in each case were equivalent, achieved in part by removing the air sac end of the egg shell. The thalamofugal visual projections, therefore, develop in response to light stimulation but appear to have no wavelength specificity. This result is consistent with the apparent lack of involvement of the thalamofugal visual pathway in colour vision. However, functional asymmetry, tested as left-right eye differences in categorising grain from pebbles, was found to be less marked in the chicks that had been exposed to green light compared to those that had been exposed to 'while' light, and it was absent in those exposed to red light or incubated in the dark. Thus, there is wavelength specificity for the development of the behavioural asymmetry, which suggests involvement of colour-coded neurons outside the thalamofugal visual pathway, probably in the tectofugal pathway. Exposure of the embryos to red and green light alternating at 30 min intervals is as effective as ""white' light for establishing both the structural and functional asymmetry.",Excluded

Apoptosis was quantified using morphology and end-labeling immunohistochemistry, and cell proliferation was detected using antibodies against the thymidine analog BrdU and the cyclin-dependent kinase p34(cdc2). Radiation-induced apoptosis occurred rapidly, with maximum morphological and end-labeling changes observed 3-6h after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation cell proliferation was significantly reduced relative to sham-irradiated controls. The number of apoptotic nuclei increased rapidly with radiation dose, reaching a plateau at about 3Gy. The maximum number of apoptotic nuclei was substantially higher than the number of proliferating cells, suggesting that non-proliferating as well as proliferating cells in the subgranular zone were sensitive to irradiation. Subgranular zone cell proliferation was significantly reduced relative to age-matched controls 120 days after doses of 5Gy or higher. These findings suggest that neural precursor cells of the dentate gyrus are very sensitive to irradiation and are not capable of repopulating the subgranular zone at least up to 120 days after irradiation. This may help explain, in part, how ionizing irradiation induces cognitive impairments in animals and humans.",Included

However, increased specific absorption rate (SAR) prohibits the application of spatial saturation band, leading to venous contamination in maximum intensity projection (MIP) images. Method(s): A segmented k-space filling scheme with sparse venous saturation pulses was developed for 7. T TOF-MRA. The effectiveness of the segmented TOF sequence was verified by Bloch equation simulation and experiments on 3. T. The protocol on 7. T was optimized and applied for healthy volunteers and patients with vascular diseases. Result(s): Segmented TOF achieved equivalent contrast and venous suppression effect as conventional methods, while SAR values had a remarkable reduction and obeyed the limit of a 7. T MRI system. The decreased number of saturation pulses allowed shorter acquisition time than existing solutions. The comparison of segmented TOF and conventional TOF revealed flow direction in vascular diseases.

However, relevant real-world data in patients with baseline brain metastasis (BM) as well as the clinical value of upfront cranial local therapy (CLT) remain scarce. Method(s): Untreated EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with BMs receiving first-line Osimertinib or first-generation EGFR-TKIs at our cancer center were retrospectively enrolled.

With a median follow-up of 17.1 months (range, 2.6-73 months), median PFS and OS was 14.6 months and 31 months, respectively. Patient groups (Osimertinib=97, first-generation group=97) were created by PSM with balanced clinic-pathological parameters, and iPFS (32.5 vs 8.4 months, p<0.001), PFS (34.7 vs 11.5months,p<0.001) and OS (40.6 vs 23.8 months, p=0.041) were significantly longer in the Osimertinib group (Figure a-c). Upfront CLT, including surgery, whole brain radiotherapy and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS), was performed in 129 patients before disease progression and it prolonged iPFS and PFS, but not OS, in the entire cohort. Among patients with baseline oligo-BMs (n=195), upfront CLT (dominated by SRS) improved iPFS (HR=0.443, p=0.001), PFS (HR=0.373, p<0.001) and OS (HR=0.795, p=0.035) (Figure d-f), which was not the case among patients with baseline multiple-BMs. Pattern of failure analyses indicated that more patients with baseline multiple-BMs turned into the status of oligo-BMs at the maximal response to EGFR-TKIs (p=0.023) and less patients developed progressive disease in the central nervous system (p=0.019) among patients receiving upfront CTL than those didn't. Of note, 8 patients with oligo-BMs but didn't receive upfront CLT developed multiple progressive disease in the brain. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world study with considerable sample size verifying the superior efficacy of first-line Osimertinib treatment in EGFR-mutant NSCLC with BMs. Additionally, upfront brain SRS was recommended for those with oligo-BMs. Keywords: Brain metastasis, osimertinib, cranial radiotherapy Copyright © 2021",Excluded
4527,"Radiation-induced osteosarcoma 16 years after surgery and radiation for glioma - Case report A 35-year-old man developed osteosarcoma of the left parietal and occipital bones 16 years after radiotherapy for glioma in the right occipital lobe. Radiotherapy of the primary neoplasm used 50 Gy administered to a localized field through two lateral ports. The secondary neoplasm arose contralateral to the primary lesion but within the irradiated field. The tumor had a multilocular cyst with considerable intracranial extension, and symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure were prominent early in the course. After a short-lived initial remission following surgical intervention and chemotherapy, the patient deteriorated because of tumor recurrence and died 18 months after the diagnosis. Radiation-induced osteosarcoma is a well-known but rare complication of radiotherapy for brain neoplasms with a poor prognosis.",Excluded

3695,"Ontogeny of light-induced decrease of N-acetyltransferase activity in explanted chick pineal glands The ontogeny of chick pineal serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity was investigated in explanted chick pineal glands at 4, 10 and 21 d of age. Nocturnal levels of the enzyme and the response of the enzyme to light exposure were determined in pineal glands maintained in short-term culture at each age. The results indicate that nocturnal NAT activity was increased in the glands from older birds. Nocturnal levels of NAT activity at the time of the initiation of the experiment were threefold greater in glands from 21-d-old birds as compared to that in glands from 4-day-old chicks. The response to light was similar in all three ages examined; light induced a significant decrease in NAT activity within 60 min in explanted glands from 4-d-old chicks and within 180 min in the glands from the 10- and 21-d-old chicks. A paradoxical transient increase in enzyme activity occurred immediately (within 5 min) following light exposure which was significant in the glands from the youngest chicks, and present, but more variable, in the older chicks. These data indicate that the nocturnal enzyme activity is greater in glands from older birds, but that light exposure of explanted glands initiates a transient rise followed by a decrease in NAT activity at all three ages.",Excluded

The locator group underwent lumbar pedicle screw placement using the intradermal locator. The control group was aided by traditional fluoroscopy. Baseline demographics, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, operation time, intraoperative fluoroscopy time and guidewire insertion time were recorded. All postoperative CT scans were reviewed by an independent spine surgeon to grade screw placement accuracy.RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (180 screws) were assigned to the locator group and 30 patients (128 screws) to the control group. The locator device could significantly reduce the fluoroscopy time [3.9 sec (SD = 1.9) vs. 9.6 sec (SD = 5.8), p < 0.001] and guidewire insertion time [2.69 min (SD = 0.67) vs. 4.49 min (SD = 1.96), p < 0.001] compared with the conventional method for each pedicle screw. The whole operation time of the locator group was shorter than that of the control group [2-segment: 243.2 min (SD = 16.9) vs. 301.7 min (SD = 14.9), p < 0.001; 1-segment: 154.5 min (SD = 14.3) vs. 194.6 min (SD = 19.3), p < 0.001]. As for the rates of pedicle breaches, postoperative VAS scores, no significant difference was found between the two groups.CONCLUSION: The intradermal locator device could help reduce the radiation exposure in percutaneous pedicle screw placement while maintaining the accuracy.",Excluded
4056,"Effects of twenty-minute 3G mobile phone irradiation on event related potential components and early gamma synchronization in auditory oddball paradigm We investigated the potential effects of 20 min irradiation from a new generation Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) 3G mobile phone on human event related potentials (ERPs) in an auditory oddball paradigm. In a double-blind task design, subjects were exposed to either genuine or sham irradiation in two separate sessions. Before and after irradiation subjects were presented with a random series of 50 ms tone burst (frequent standards: 1 kHz, P=0.8, rare deviants: 1.5 kHz, P=0.2) at a mean repetition rate of 1500 ms while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The subjects' task was to silently count the appearance of targets. The amplitude and latency of the N100, N200, P200 and P300 components for targets and standards were analyzed in 29 subjects. We found no significant effects of electromagnetic field (EMF) irradiation on the amplitude and latency of the above ERP components. In order to study possible effects of EMF on attentional processes, we applied a wavelet-based time-frequency method to analyze the early gamma component of brain responses to auditory stimuli. We found that the early evoked gamma activity was insensitive to UMTS RF exposition. Our results support the notion, that a single 20 min irradiation from new generation 3G mobile phones does not induce measurable changes in latency or amplitude of ERP components or in oscillatory gamma-band activity in an auditory oddball paradigm.",Excluded
4673,"[Clinical analysis of radiation optic neuropathy] OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features, risk factors, diagnostic methods, treatment regimens and outcomes of Chinese adult patients with radiation optic neuropathy (RON).METHODS: Retrospective case series. Clinical data with RON admitted to Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from June 1999 to October 2010 were investigated retrospectively.RESULTS: Thirty-five cases (61 eyes) with RON were analyzed. All cases manifested as sudden binocular or monocular painless vision decrease. In 18 cases (51.4%), symptoms occurred within 36 months after the completion of radiation. In 43 eyes (70.5%), the visual acuity was less than 0.05 and/or with a visual field less than 10 degrees. In 52 eyes which the fundus could be examined, 41 eyes (78.8%) showed a clear boundary of optic papilla, including 6 eyes (14.6%) with normal appearance of optic papilla, 30 eyes (73.2%) with lighter color, 5 eyes (12.2%) with pale optic papilla, and 11 eyes (21.2%) with edematous or hemorrhagic and/or exudative optic papilla. Only 14 eyes showed abnormal visual field examination, mainly manifested as nerve bundle defect scotoma. Seven eyes (50%) manifested as arcuate scotoma, 3 eyes (21.4%) manifested as central scotoma and/or paracentral scotoma, 2 eyes accompanied by blind spot enlargement, 1 eye showed paracentral scotoma and 1 eye with quadrantanopia. Twenty-three eyes received fluorescein angiography (FFA), the major manifestations were low fluorescence at the optic nerve and areas of capillary nonperfusion. Pattern visual evoked potential revealed reduced amplitude and/or extended incubation period in 83.3% eyes. Treatment regimens including systemic corticosteroids, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, hyperbaric oxygen in combination with corticosteroid and laser photocoagulation, the visual acuity of 10 eyes (16.4%) had merely been improved.CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of visual function in RON is poor resulting from devastating visual loss and/or visual field defect. The main damage of the fundus is retinal vascular occlusion and optic atrophy at different degrees. No adequately effective therapies are proved currently. The treatment aimed on the complication could only provide a short-term improvement of the vision.",Excluded
4521,"Additional benefits of three-dimensional ultrasound for prenatal assessment of twins Three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) may provide additional information for prenatal assessment of twins. It may improve the diagnostic confidence of dating, nuchal translucency (NT) and chorionicity assignment in twin pregnancies. The ""virtual 3DUS placentoscopy"" can guide selective fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (SFLP) to treat twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Volumetric assessment of the dysmorphic acardiac twin with the Virtual Organ Computer-aided Analysis (VOCAL) software is more accurate than the conventional ultrasound measurement. Twin anemia polycythemia (TAP) sequence and selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) may be clinically monitored with 3DUS placental volume (PV) and power Doppler vascular indices. Congenital anomalies are more common in twins. Evaluation of fetal anomalies with 3DUS could assist perinatal management. The 3DUS power Doppler can provide a better understanding of true and false umbilical cord knots, which are commonly found in monoamniotic (MA) twins. Single demise in monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies can cause severe neurologic morbidity in the surviving co-twin. Prenatal prediction of brain injury in the surviving co-twin with unremarkable neurosonographic examination is difficult. The 3DUS power Doppler may aid in prenatal detection of subtle abnormal cerebral perfusion. Prenatal assessment of conjoined twins with 3DUS is important if emergency postnatal surgical separation is anticipated. There is no significant additional advantage in using real-time 3DUS to guide prenatal interventions. Assessment of the cervix and pelvic floor during twin pregnancies is enhanced with 3DUS. Due to lack of high-quality studies, routine prenatal 3DUS in twin pregnancies needs to be balanced with risks of excessive ultrasound exposure.

In addition, the probable effects of radiotherapy on the activities of antioxidant enzymes and levels of nitric oxide (NO) in the plasma were investigated as well. The effects of melatonin treatment on radiotherapy-based central nervous system (CNS) damage were also studied. For this purpose, the rats were randomized into four groups. The first group was the control group (sham-exposed group), the second group received only melatonin, the third group was irradiated and the fourth group received both melatonin and irradiation. Plasma samples of rats were collected for measuring the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and the levels of NO. 24 h after the interventions, tissue samples were obtained from the hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex for the light microscopic investigations. These tissues were mostly affected by radiation. The results indicated that the application of radiation significantly enhanced the levels of plasma SOD and NO. On the other hand, melatonin pretreatment prevented the decrease in plasma CAT activity induced by irradiation. It was found that the application of melatonin could significantly prevent the irradiation-induced damages. Light microscopic results revealed that the damage of the CNS by radiation was prevented by the application of melatonin.",Included
4565,"Hyperbaric oxygen for neurologic indications. Action plan for multicenter trials in: Stroke, traumatic brain injury, radiation encephalopathy and status migrainosus Introduction: There is great interest in using hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) to treat neurological disease. The exquisite sensitivity of neural tissue to hypoxia makes increased oxygenation attractive as a therapy for disease processes that induce ischemia, edema, and, more recently, apoptosis. Four things specifically exist as targets for future projects and clinical trials: (1) stroke (2) traumatic brain injury (3) radiation induced necrosis and (4) status migrainosus. Method(s): Specific aims: Stroke: determine if the use of HBO in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke is effective at improving outcomes. TBI: determine whether use of HBO in the acute state after traumatic brain injury is effective at improving outcomes and reducing elevated ICP. RIN: determine whether HBO treatment of radiation necrosis of brain results in improvement of neurological function and reduction of necrosis. Migraine: determine whether use of HBO will relieve headache pain in status migrainosus. Result(s): Stroke: there is evidence from animal studies that focal cerebral ischemia may improve after HBO treatment. TBI: the interest in using HBO to treat TBI is based upon the premise that hypoxia, edema and apoptosis play significant roles in the pathophysiology of the disease. RIN: the evidence suggests that in cases where either the patient is not improving on medical therapies or when surgical resection is not possible, HBO should be considered as a treatment option. Migraine: there is some evidence looking at HBO as an effective treatment of acute migraine attack. Summary: Each is discussed further with proposed study design and justification for their respective parameters. As our action plan moving forward, it is our goal to investigate in each area with multidisciplinary, multi-centered, case controlled double blind crossover studies.",Excluded

4802,Irradiated normal brain promotes invasion of glioblastoma through vascular endothelial growth and stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha The significance of irradiated normal brain volume in glioma recurrence is usually ignored by radiotherapists. The whole-brain irradiation (WBI) of 15 Gy in three fractions was delivered to C57BL/6 mice before implantation of GL261 glioma cells. The changes in vascular endothelial growth (VEGF) and stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) after WBI were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Cell invasion assays were performed to study the effects of VEGF and SDF-1alpha. The levels of VEGF and SDF-1alpha in normal brain tissues increased after 15 Gy WBI. The WBI before tumor implantation significantly increased the invasive ability of GL261 cells. VEGF and SDF-1alpha could promote invasion of GL261 cells even after high-dose irradiation. The combination of irradiation and inhibitors such as AMD3100 may prevent irradiation-stimulated dissemination of glioma cells.,Included
3669,"Initial experience with bedside monitoring of stroke and cerebral perfusion using time domain near-infrared spectroscopy (TD-NIRS): Feasibility and future directions Background: Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) may provide continuous, multiregional parenchymal bedside perfusion monitoring without the risks of patient transport, contrast, or radiation. Time-domain NIRS (TD-NIRS) uses pulsed light attenuation at multiple wavelengths (600-950 nm) to discretely quantify oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin and determine total hemoglobin, oxygen saturation (OS) and cerebral blood volume (BV) in the region between each light source and detector. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of employing a novel TD-NIRS technology to assess absolute levels of cerebral BV and OS with broad spatial coverage in order to detect regions of ischemia. Method(s): Ischemic stroke (IS) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients underwent TD-NIRS measurements. IS patients were fitted with a rectangular probe over the region of ischemia (2 rows of 4 sources between 3 rows of 5 detectors), using CT as a guide (external acoustic meatus as reference). SAH patients were fitted with a linear ""anterior crown"" probe with light sources and detectors arranged alternating in a single row (7 sources, 6 detectors). Clearance above the frontal sinus was guided by CT imaging (nasion as reference). 1.8 cm separated all source-detector pairs. Time-correlated single photon-counting photomultiplier tubes detected photons to measure absorption of pulsed light emitted at 3 wavelengths (690, 805, and 835 nm). Maximal OS (OSmax) and BV (BVmax) were calculated for the entire region measured by the probe to enable multiple comparisons. Result(s): In IS patients, ischemic regions (n=4) had an OSmax of 65.8 SD 13.1; contralateral normal tissue had an OSmax of 85.3 SD 27.1 (paired t-test; p 0.14). Ischemic regions had a BVmax of 76.25 SD 24.17 compared with 104.0 SD 42.5 in contralateral normal tissue (p 0.18). Regional inspection showed good visual correlation with infarcts (Figure). Of SAH patients with serial measures (n=2), one developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and bilateral infarcts, coincident with decreased BVmax on the right (72, day 1; 48, day 12) and left (153, day 1; 56, day 12); OS did not change. Conclusion(s): We were able to calculate multiregional BV and OS for patients with cerebral ischemia. Despite small sample size, we demonstrated a trend between contralateral (ischemic stroke) and historical (subarachnoid hemorrhage) controls. Leakage of light and absorption by hair produced artifacts that will require improvement in future applications. This system requires validation and further ergonomic refinement but has potential to enable continuous multiregional parenchymal monitoring. (Figure presented).",Excluded
4390,"In vitro neurotoxic effects of 1 GeV/n iron particles assessed in retinal explants The heavy ion component of the cosmic radiation remains problematic to the assessment of risk in manned space flight. The biological effectiveness of HZE particles has yet to be established, particularly with regard to nervous tissue. Using heavy ions accelerated at the AGS of Brookhaven National Laboratory, we study the neurotoxic effects of iron particles. We exposed retinal explants, taken from chick embryos, to determine the dose response relationships for neurite outgrowth. Morphometric techniques were used to evaluate the in vitro effects of 1 GeV/a iron particles (LET 148 keV/micrometer). Iron particles produced a dose-dependent reduction of neurite outgrowth with a maximal effect achieved with a dose of 100 cGy. Doses as low as 10-50 cGy were able to induce reductions of the neurite outgrowth as compared to the control group. Neurite generation is a more sensitive parameter than neurite elongation, suggesting different mechanism of radiation damage in our model. These results showed that low doses/fluences of iron particles could impair the retinal ganglion cells' capacity to generate neurites indicating the highly neurotoxic capability of this heavy charged particle.",Included
4621,"Clinical outcome and prognostic factors for central neurocytoma Purpose/Objective(s): Central neurocytomas are intraventricular neoplasms of the central nervous system that comprise 0.25- 0.5% of brain tumors and their optimal management remains controversial due to their rarity. We assessed clinical outcome for a historical cohort of neurocytoma patients and evaluated effects of tumor atypia, tumor size, extent of resection (EOR), and adjuvant radiation (RT). Materials/Methods: Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from date of first surgical resection. Differences in PFS were measured by Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazard ratio methods. Tumor atypia was defined as MIB-1 index >2%, focal necrosis, or microvascular proliferation, as previously established. Result(s): A total of 22 patients (14 males, 8 females) were treated between 1995 and 2009, with a median age at diagnosis of 24 years (range 11-62). A total of 8 patients experienced recurrent/progressive disease. Median follow-up by MRI was 38 month (range 0.1-183) for those who have not progressed. Overall 3-yr PFS was 70% (CI 41-86%). Only three patients died and all had atypical tumors. For the remaining patients, median follow-up for survival was 51 month (range 0.1-183). We examined effects of tumor atypia and MIB-1 labeling. Ten of 22 tumors had atypical features. There was near 100% concordance between tumor atypia and MIB-1 labeling: only 1 tumor was atypical based on microvascular proliferation but had MIB-1 <= 2%. Three-year PFS was 78% for MIB labeling <= 2% and 39% for MIB labeling >2% (HR 7.7, CI 2 - 40, p = 0.016). Median tumor diameter was 4.3 cm (range 0.8-8.6 cm). Three-yr PFS was 48% (CI 21-77%) for tumor >4.3 cm and 74.1% (CI 29-93%) for tumor <=4.3 cm (HR 1.6, CI 0.5 - 6.6, p = 0.49). We examined influence of EOR and adjuvant RT. Five patients had gross total resection (GTR), and 17 had subtotal resection (STR). No patient had a biopsy only. Seven patients progressed after STR, and one patient recurred after GTR. None of the GTR patients received adjuvant RT and four of the STR patients received adjuvant RT. Three-year PFS rates by extent of resection and adjuvant RT are shown (in table below). Conclusion(s): For patients with central neurocytoma, MIB-1 labeling index >2% significantly predicts worse outcome. The additional criteria for tumor atypia did not add useful prognostic information. Although patient numbers are too small for conclusive confirmation, our data indicate that lesser EOR and larger tumors size may confer worse prognosis and adjuvant RTafter STR may improve PFS.

3974,"Gamma knife is effective for type II neurofibromatosisassociated meningioma: A 16-year mayo experience Introduction/Objective: Type 2 neurofibromatosis (NF2) is a debilitating genetic condition characterized by multiple meningiomas, vestibular schwannomas, and other intracranial and intraspinal tumors such as ependymomas. We reported our experience treating a series of NF2-associated meningiomas with Gamma Knife (GK). Method(s): Between January 1992 and December 2008, 16 consecutive patients (7 male, 9 female, age 20 to 81) with 58 intracranial meningiomas were treated with single-fraction GK. Thirty-three tumors (57%) involved the convexity or parasagittal/falx, 25 (43%) skullbased. None of these meningiomas received prior surgery. Nine patients (56%) had more than 1 meningoma (range, 2 to 4) at presentation. Six patients (38%) also had intraspinal meningiomas which were never treated by radiation. All patients had bilateral (81%) or unilateral (19%) vestibular schwannomas. During follow-up, 6 patients (38%) developed 26 (46%) new intracranial meningomas, termed distant progression, requiring secondary treatments. The median prescription dose was 16 Gy (range, 13 to 20), with a maximum dose of 32 Gy (range, 24 to 40). The median heterogeneity index was 2 (range, 1.3 to 2.5). The median tumor diameter and prescription isodose volume were 2.3 cm and 3.6 cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) between GK shots per tumor (median 4, range 1 to 22) versus tumor volume was 0.59. The median radiographic and clinical followup periods were 62 and 86 months, respectively. Result(s): Over a median follow-up period of 3.1 years (range, 0.4 to 14.6), ten patients (63%) required only one treatment, and 6 (37%) required 1 to 6 additional treatments for distant progression. Fifteen (93.8%) patients were alive at last follow-up, with fifty-five tumors (94.8%) controlled (smaller or unchanged in size). Three in-field tumors (5.2%) became larger at 36, 56 and 82 months, respectively, but were not re-treated; they belonged to the same patient who had 14 meningomas treated over 7 times (in 12.7 y). There were no marginal failures. The median time to first radiographic distant progression was 13.7 months (range, 6.2 to 77.5). One minor complication was noted at 12 months, with hemi-body sensory changes which resolved. Two major radiation-related complications occurred at 1 and 3 months, including a 34-year-old woman who died following GK for a parasagittal meningioma. GK-related complication rates remained low overall, and were not associated with tumor volume, location, prescription dose, or chosen isodose level. Conclusion(s): GK is an effective treatment for NF2 patients with meningoma, with 5-year local control rate greater than 90% in our series. Side effects are rare but can be life-threatening including radionecrosis, which may occur within three months after treatment. For NF2 patients who developed distant progression and required repeat treatments elsewhere intracranially, secondary GK appeared safe and equally successful when compared with primary treatment. No high-grade meningoma or secondary non-meningioma malignancy were found as a result of GK radiation exposure.",Excluded
4209,"Differential processing of laser stimuli by Adelta and C fibres in major depression Clinical studies have revealed that up to 92% of major depressed patients report pain complaints such as back or abdominal pain. Furthermore, patients suffering from depression exhibit increased superficial pain thresholds and decreased ischemic (deep) pain thresholds during experimental pain testing in comparison to healthy controls. Here, we aimed to investigate a putative role of Adelta- and C-fibre activation in altered pain perception in the disease. Laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) of 27 unmedicated depressed patients and 27 matched controls were recorded. Adelta and C fibres were activated separately. Amplitudes and latencies of N2 and P2 peaks of Adelta- (Adelta-LEP) and C-fibre- (C-LEP) related LEPs were evaluated. Depressed patients showed significantly decreased Adelta-LEP amplitudes (N2 peak: P=0.019; P2 peak: P=0.024) and delayed C-LEP latencies (P2 peak: P=0.0495; N2 peak: P=0.0556). In contrast, C-LEP amplitudes and Adelta-LEP latencies were unaffected. Our results might be suggestive of the differential impact of physiological changes on pain processing in depression. Thus, Adelta-LEP might reflect the physiological correlate of the augmented superficial pain thresholds during depression. On the contrary, the C-fibre component mediates the facets of pain processing, outlasting the stimulation period, and has been shown to be exaggerated in chronic pain states. Therefore, the functional over-representation of the C-fibre component found in our study might be a possible link between depression and associated pain complaints.",Excluded
4618,"Bridging Radiation Therapy Before Commercial Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy for Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma Purpose: CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy has emerged as a promising treatment for relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma (r/rABL), culminating in 2 US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies: tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) and axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel). Following leukapheresis and in preparation for CART infusion, contemporary bridging and lymphodepletion regimens rely mostly on cytotoxic chemotherapy. Here, in a cohort of patients treated with commercial tisa-cel and axi-cel, we show that bridging-RT may offer a supplemental approach. Methods and Materials: Thirty-one patients receiving commercial tisa-cel (n = 13) or axi-cel (n = 18) between August 2018 and February 2019 for r/rABL were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: (1) bridging-RT within 30 days of CART infusion or (2) nonbridging-RT (NBRT), in which patients received either remote RT greater than 30 days before CART infusion or no prior RT. Result(s): Five patients received bridging-RT within 30 days of CART infusion. Median bridging-RT dose was 37.5 Gy and was completed a median of 13 days before infusion. No grade 3 (G3) or higher RT-toxicities occurred. No patients in the bridging-RT group experienced G3 or higher CART-related toxicities (CRS or neurotoxicity), and 23% (n = 6) and 15% (n = 4) experienced G3-5 CRS and G3-5 neurotoxicity in the NBRT group, respectively. Overall treatment response in the bridging-RT and NBRT groups was 80% and 64%, respectively. The axi-cel CART product was associated with CRS (odds ratio [OR] = 26.67, P =.001) and CRS correlated with neurotoxicity (OR = 12.22, P =.028). There was a trend toward an association for CRS with metabolic tumor volume (OR = 1.06/mL, P =.141) and TLG (OR = 1.01/mL x standard uptake value, P =.099). Conclusion(s): Bridging-RT before commercial CART does not appear to increase the risk for CART-related toxicities or negatively affect outcomes in r/rABL patients. No G3 or higher RT-toxicities occurred in this series. Pretreatment metabolic tumor burden may be associated with CART-associated CRS; however, larger patient numbers are required to elucidate significant associations. Future work to prospectively assess the value of bridging-RT is warranted. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Another age-matched 115 patients who had no radiotherapy but symptomatic high-grade (>70%) carotid stenoses were enrolled as referent subjects. Digital subtraction angiography was performed within 2 months from stroke onset and delineated carotid and vertebrobasilar circulations from aortic arch up to intracranial branches. Two reviewers blinded to group assignment recorded all vascular lesions, collateral status, and infarct pattern.RESULTS: ORV patients had less atherosclerotic risk factors at presentation. In referent patients, high-grade stenoses were mostly focal at the proximal internal carotid artery. In contrast, high-grade ORV lesions diffusely involved the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery and were more frequently bilateral (54% versus 22%), tandem (23% versus 10%), associated with complete occlusion in one or both carotid arteries (30% versus 9%), vertebral artery (VA) steno-occlusions (28% versus 16%), and external carotid artery stenosis (19% versus 5%) (all P<0.05). With comparable rates of vascular anomaly, ORV patients showed more established collateral circulations through leptomeningeal arteries, anterior communicating artery, posterior communicating artery, suboccipital/costocervical artery, and retrograde flow in ophthalmic artery. In terms of infarct topography, the frequencies of cortical or subcortical watershed infarcts were similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: ORV angiographic features and corresponding collaterals are distinct from atherosclerotic patterns at initial stroke presentation. Clinical decompensation, despite more extensive collateralization, may precipitate stroke in ORV.",Included
4149,"Genetic and physiological regulation of non-homologous end-joining in mammalian cells Repair of DSBs is important to prevent chromosomal fragmentation, translocations and deletions. To investigate the process in NHEJ, we have established an in vitro system to clarify the measurement and analysis of the efficiency and the fidelity of rejoining of DSBs, and applied the method to investigate NHEJ in human cells derived from patients suffering from cancer-prone hereditary diseases. A DSB was introduced in plasmid pZErO-2 at a specific site within the ccdB gene that is lethal to E. coli cells, and treated with nuclear extracts from human cells. The efficiency of rejoining in the nuclear extract from an A-T cell line was comparable to that from a control cell line. However, the accuracy of rejoining was much lower for the A-T cell extract than for the control cell extract. All mutations were deletions, most of which contained short direct repeats at the breakpoint junctions. The deletion spectrum caused by the A-T nuclear extract was distinct from that by the control extract. These results indicate that A-T cells have certain deficiencies in end-joining of double-strand breaks in DNA. The extract from BS cells also showed the similar activity and the lower fidelity of rejoing compared to that from normal cells. From the sequencing analysis of the junction of DSBs, it is speculated that the defect in the BLM helicase might cause irregular rejoining of DSBs. Radioadaptive response is the acquirement of cellular resistance to ionizing radiation by prior exposure to low dose. We investigated the in vitro end-joining activity of DNA ends in radioadaptive cells. Both the efficiency and the fidelity of rejoining in the cells pre-exposed to low dose are increased comparing to those without pre-exposure. We also investigated the joining activity of DNA ends in p53-deficient cells. Pre-irradiation caused no apparent alteration in both the efficiency and fidelity of end-joining. These results suggest that the exposure to low dose activates a cellular function to repair DSBs efficiently, which is dependent on p53. These results indicate that NHEJ pathway is regulated by many factors; genetic regulation by ATM and BLM, and physiological conditions such as irradiation with ionizing radiation. The observations also suggest that in some occasions p53 might play a key role in NHEJ. [References: 103]",Excluded
4186,"Determination of the sizes of the opioid receptors in their membrane environment by radiation inactivation Opioids, like other drugs, are thought to initiate their effects by association with their specific receptors. However, very little is known about the opioid receptor as a molecular entity. The binding components have been solubilized in detergent and purified by different approaches, but the molecular size of soluble opioid receptor complexes reported by different groups varied from 23,000 to 750,000. In this study, the technique of radiation inactivation by gamma rays was used to investigate the apparent size of the opioid receptor in rat brain membranes under different conditions. The molecular sizes of opioid receptor complexes were estimated as 313,000 +/- 13,500 in the presence of [D-Ala2, D-Leu5] enkephalin, NaCl and Gpp (NH)p; as 165,000 +/- 8,500 in the presence of NaCl only, or of both NaCl and Gpp (NH)p; as 217,000 +/- 6,600 in the presence of Gpp (NH)p only; and as 286,000 +/- 60,900 in the presence of MgCl2 only. A simple model has been proposed to explain these different apparent target sizes of opioid receptors obtained under different conditions.",Excluded
4522,"Inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase as a protective effect of nicaraven in ionizing radiation- and ara-C-induced cell death BACKGROUND: Nicaraven is a drug used for patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. It crosses the blood-brain barrier and has potent antivasospastic and brain-protective effects. While nicaraven scavenges the hydroxyl radical, the mechanism of its protection remains obscure. In addition to the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect, nicaraven also exhibits inhibitory action on poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The mechanism of the pharmacological action of nicaraven has not yet been clarified.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human myeloid HL-525 cells were exposed to ionizing radiation or hydrogen peroxide and the effect of nicaraven on the activation of the Egr-1 promoter was measured. Next, the action of the drug on DNA fragmentation and inhibition of thymidine uptake caused by the genotoxic stimulation of ionizing radiation or cytosine B-D-arabinofuranoside (ara-C) were assessed. Finally, direct inhibition of the PARP enzyme by nicaraven was measured.RESULTS: Nicaraven did not inhibit the activation of the Egr-1 promoter caused by H2O2 and the activation caused by ionizing radiation. However, the drug repressed DNA fragmentation and increased thymidine uptake dose-dependently. Nicaraven had a direct inhibitory effect on PARP.DISCUSSION: The effect of nicaraven on the Egr-1 promoter was different from that of another free-radical scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine. Nicaraven demonstrated similar protection of the PARP inhibitors including 3-aminobenzamide. Since nicaraven directly inhibits the PARP enzyme, the drug might be useful in oncology as well as in studying tissue-damaging conditions characterized by increased PARP activity.",Excluded
4603,"Flow cytometric analysis of rat striatal nerve terminals Methods were developed for the analysis and isolation of striatal nerve terminals (synaptosomes) using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Comparison of the light-scattering properties of synaptosomal and mitochondrial fractions indicated that particles in the synaptosomal fraction were generally larger and more sensitive to hypotonic lysis, consistent with results obtained by other methods of analysis. FACS analysis using indirect immunofluorescence techniques indicated that approximately 84% of the synaptosomal fraction was labeled by monoclonal antibody (mAb) A2B5 and thus appeared to be of neuronal origin. After permeabilization, between 5 and 10% of the particles were labeled by a mAb to glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggesting that they were derived from astrocytes. A fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) was used to distinguish intact synaptosomes from free mitochondria (only the former maintain a membrane potential under the present experimental conditions). Approximately 83% of the synaptosomal fraction exhibited increased fluorescence after incubation with the VSD; furthermore, the fluorescence signal decreased in response to depolarizing agents (elevated potassium and veratridine). A portion of the mitochondrial fraction responded similarly, consistent with the presence of contaminating synaptosomes. Analysis of synaptosomal labeling by 11 fluorescein-conjugated plant lectins indicated that striatal nerve terminals differ significantly in their cell surface glycoconjugates. Subpopulations of synaptosomes defined on the basis of lectin binding were collected by FACS onto filters and probed with a mAb to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) using Western blot techniques. While subpopulations exhibited different amounts of TH immunoreactivity, none of the lectins appeared to recognize TH-positive (i.e., dopaminergic) synaptosomes exclusively. These findings demonstrate that synaptosomes can be characterized and isolated for further study based on FACS analysis of properties such as size, membrane potential, and the presence of intracellular or cell surface molecules.",Excluded

Surgery +/- radiotherapy is the mainstay treatment. This international multicentric study aims to evaluate the outcomes of CNs patients after multimodal therapies and identify predictive factors. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively identified 33 patients with CN treated between 2005 and 2019. Treatment characteristics and outcomes were assessed. Result(s): All patients with CN underwent surgical resection. Radiotherapy was delivered in 19 patients. The median radiation dose was 54 Gy (range, 50-60 Gy). The median follow-up time was 56 months. The 5-year OS and 5-year PFS were 90% and 76%, respectively. Patients who received radiotherapy had a significantly longer PFS than patients without RT (p = 0.004) and a trend towards longer OS. In addition, complete response after treatments was associated with longer PFS (p = 0.07). Conclusion(s): Using RT seems to be associated with longer survival rates with an acceptable toxicity profile. Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Included

Data from 86 centers across the world were analyzed. All CT interactions were automatically collected and transmitted to the CT vendor during two 6-week periods immediately before and 2 weeks after implementation of ATVS. A total of 164 323 unique CT studies were analyzed. Studies were categorized by body region and type of examination. Tube voltage and volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) were compared between examinations performed with ATVS and those performed before ATVS implementation. Descriptive statistical methods and multilevel linear regression models were used for analysis.RESULTS: Across all types of CT examinations and body regions, CTDIvol was 14.7% lower in examinations performed with ATVS (n = 30 313) than in those performed before ATVS implementation (n = 79 275). Relative reductions in mean CTDIvol were most notable for temporal bone CT (-56.1%), peripheral runoff CT angiography (-48.6%), CT of the paranasal sinus (-39.6%), cerebral or carotid CT angiography (-36.4%), coronary CT angiography (-25.1%), and head CT (-23.9%). An increase in mean CTDIvol was observed for renal stone protocols (26.2%) and thoracic or lumbar spine examinations (6.6%). In the multilevel model with fixed effects ATVS and examination type, and the interaction of these variables and the random effect country, a significant influence on CTDIvol for all fixed efects was revealed (ATVS, P = .0031; examination type, P < .0001; interaction term, P < .0001).CONCLUSION: ATVS significantly reduces radiation dose across most, but not all, body regions and types of CT examinations.",Excluded

Recently, post-radiation gliomas have been reported.METHODS: The authors review 88 cases of cerebral glioma following radiotherapy in patients operated for neoplasms of the nervous system, including 6 personal cases of post-radiation gliomas treated in the Neurosurgical Division of the Department of Neurological Sciences, ""La Sapienza"" University, Rome. The criteria used to define this unusual pathologic association are discussed.RESULTS: There was a male predominance. Post-radiation gliomas were particularly malignant, the average dose was 33 Gy, and average free latency was 9.6 years. The first disease was most frequently acute lymphatic leukemia.CONCLUSIONS: Post-radiation gliomas have particular features but do not present a histologic or clinical behavior different from analogous spontaneous gliomas. The fact that 88 cases have been reported in recent years suggests that a thorough biological, clinical studies be carried out on this association. [References: 56]",Excluded
4137,"Predicting image registration quality from the shape of the similarity metric: Potential for machine learning approaches Purpose: Typically, image guided radiotherapy relies on rigid body (RB) image registration (IR) between a reference and localisation image. Automated IR algorithms based on iterative optimisation of a similarity metric (SM) between two images are used extensively and improve the efficiency and accuracy of this process. Occasionally these algorithms do not locate the global optimum of the SM which, if undetected, could lead to a geometric treatment error. This feasibility study uses machine learning to predict the likelihood that the location of the 'found' optimum was acceptably close to the global optimum based on measures of the SM hyper-surface. Materials: Three CBCT images and their reference CT image for each of six patients previously treated with intra-cranial radiotherapy were chosen for this study. The global optimum RB transform for each image pair was located by applying random misalignments before IR and calculating the average rigid body transform returned by the algorithm. A measure of target registration error (TRE) was calculated for each registration from the residual RB transform. IRs were classified as 'Good' (TRE < 0.6mm), 'OK' (0.6<TRE<2.5mm) or 'Poor' (TRE>2.5mm). The correlation ratio SM was calculated along the six cardinal axis of the RB transform space at intervals of 0.2mm. The shape of the SM was characterised by seven different measures describing minimum SM, accuracy and distinctiveness of optimum. These measures were used to train and test a Bayesian Network using K-fold cross validation. The machine learning process was repeated using just 25 points; the 'found' optimum and two points either siDe of the location of the 'found' optimum on the six cardinal axes of the RB transform.Three CBCT images and their reference CT image for each of six patients previously treated with intra-cranial radiotherapy were chosen for this study.

Almost identical results were achieved with the 25 point measures but one out of 449 IRs were classified as 'Good' when actually 'Poor'. Conclusion(s): This demonstrates the potential for machine learning based on the local shape of the SM hyper-surface to check likelihood of IR accuracy using only a few calculations of the SM. Such methods could be used to reassure radiation technologists when auto-IR is successful and indicate when closer scrutiny and manual adjustment of image alignment is required.",Excluded
4589,"Measuring smoking-induced extrastriatal dopamine release: A [11C]FLB-457 pet study Background: Preclinical studies indicate that nicotine can induce dopamine (DA) release in striatal and cortical brain regions, contributing to the reinforcing and cognitive effects respectively. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies using the D2/3 radiotracer [11C] raclopride to indirectly measure DA release via receptor occupancy have confirmed that tobacco smoking releases DA in striatal regions in humans. However, due to the low density of DA receptors in the cortex it was not possible to measure extrastriatal DA release in humans until the recent development of high affinity D2/3 radiotracers. In this study we used the high affinity D2/3 radiotracer [11C]FLB-457 to index tobacco-induced extrastriatal DA release in smokers. Method(s): Ten nicotine-dependent daily cigarette smokers underwent two high affinity [11C]FLB-457 PET scans: after overnight abstinence and smoking reinstatement (biochemically verified by expired carbon monoxide and plasma nicotine levels). Craving, withdrawal, mood and cognitive performance were assessed under both smoking conditions. Voxel-wise parameter estimation of binding potential (BPND) was performed using the basis function implementation of SRTM with the tissue time activity curve of the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. Spatially normalized [11C]FLB-457 BPND maps were statistically investigated to assess significant changes between the two conditions at every voxel using paired-tests (SPM 8). Results from the whole-brain voxel-wise paired t-test (abstinence 4 smoking) were masked with a map of a-priori regions of interest and subjected to an uncorrected threshold of p<0.05, with a minimum 30-voxel cluster extent. Result(s): There was a reduction [11C]FLB-457 BPND following smoking (an indirect measure of DA release) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; 323 voxels, peak t=3.38, p=0.004), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex/ anterior cingulate cortex (dmPFC / ACC; 1496 voxels, peak t=5.32, p<0.001), both of which survived a more stringent threshold of p<0.01, and the left insula (47 voxels, peak t=2.54 p=0.016). Exploratory analysis focused on limbic regions identified an effect in the bilateral amygdala (Left: 102 voxels, peak t=3.28, p=0.005; Right: 108 voxels, peak t =3.03, p=0.007). Extraction of values from these clusters revealed % changes in BPND in smoking versus abstinence conditions of -12.0% (SD=9.4) in the dlPFC, -11.5% (SD=12.8) in the dmPFC/ACC, -7.1% (SD=7.9) in the left insula and -13.1% in the bilateral amygdala. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of smoking-induced DA release in cortical regions such as the dlPFC, dmPFC and ACC. There was also some evidence for DA release in the insula and amygdala. The dmPFC, ACC, insula and amygdala are regions consistently associated with tobacco cue-presentaton, subjective craving and relapse susceptibility in fMRI studies, while the dlPFC appears to exert top-down control on tobacco craving and is involved in tobacco's pro-cognitive effects. As such [11C]FLB- 457 may be a useful tool to investigate individual differences in tobacco addiction severity and treatment response.",Excluded
3630,"Relapsed multiple myeloma presenting as CNS myelomatosis Background: A 68-year old man with a history of IgA lambda-restricted multiple myeloma was transferred to our hospital for suspected worsening disease following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) 4 months prior. He presented to his primary physician with diplopia, nausea and vomiting, and worsening back pain in the setting of complete bone marrow remission and negative oncology work up at day +100 from ASCT. MRI after a fall revealed multifocal epidural and intrathecal masses at T8-T11, an enhancing pituitary mass, and scattered decreased T1 signal consistent with myelomatous involvement of the calvarium. CSF cytology and biopsy of the spinal lesions showed malignant plasma cells. The patient underwent whole brain and thoracic spine radiation, but succumbed on hospital day 7. An autopsy was requested. Design(s): Standard dissection of the thoraco-abdominal organ block revealed a consolidated pneumonia of the entire left lung with visceral pleural involvement by myeloma and associated diaphragmatic adhesions. Gross lesions of the axial skeleton were not identified. Gross examination of the brain and spinal cord was unremarkable. The pituitary gland was grossly enlarged and nodular. The brain and partial spinal cord were fixed in 10% formalin for 21 days. Result(s): Microscopic examination of brain sections revealed diffuse leptomeningeal involvement by CD138+, lambda-restricted malignant plasma cells. The cerebellum demonstrated myeloma cells tracking into perivascular spaces of the parenchyma. The pituitary showed near replacement of the neurohypophysis with myeloma. Malignant plasma cells were also identified in the lung parenchyma, visceral pleura and focally within the thyroid. Conclusion(s): Neurologic sequelae of multiple myeloma are common, but usually secondary to direct extension or compression of nerve structures due to bone lesions. CNS myelomatosis is rare, with a 1% estimated incidence. It has been reported in patients with presumed complete remission of disease; several cases reported in patients who are post ASCT. CNS involvement of multiple myeloma has an invariably poor prognosis, and there is no standardized treatment approach. Due to prior case reports of CNS involvement in presumed disease remission following ASCT and the present case with its acute and fulminant presentation, diagnostic suspicion of CNS involvement by myeloma should be routinely considered in patients with a history of myeloma and new neurologic findings on clinical exam. A complete neuropathological assessment should be included in autopsies of such patients, particularly in the setting of grossly normal CNS findings.",Excluded
3661,"Glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic currents in ganglion cells from isolated retinae of pigmented rats during postnatal development This study was aimed at characterizing the earliest phases of synaptogenesis in the mammalian retina. Spontaneous activity of ganglion cells in the isolated superfused retina was used as an indicator for the functionality of synaptic connections. Retinal ganglion neurons (RGNs) were identified by location of their somata in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and by their ability to generate large (> 500 pA) voltage-activated sodium currents. Spontaneous spiking was found in many RGNs prior to cell perfusion. Between postnatal day (P) 1 and 18, a total of 195 RGNs was tested for light-induced currents, conductance changes in response to exogenous glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and depolarizing or hyperpolarizing synaptic activity. The vast majority of the material was derived from RGNs at day P5. Whole-cell ion currents were always sampled at somatic sites, using either conventional or perforated patch whole-cell recordings. On day P5, 5% of tested RGNs (n = 73) were already responsive to light stimulation. A higher percentage of cells (23%, n = 187) generated spontaneous depolarizing currents that were regarded as glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), since (1) they were blocked by Glu antagonists, (2) they conformed to the Na+/Cs+ equilibrium potential, (3) and they displayed a time course characteristic of glutamatergic EPSCs. The mean EPSC amplitude was 19.0 pA (S.D. 11.83 pA). Amplitude distributions were fitted by multiple Gaussian equations rendering a quantal size of 6.6 to 9.1 pA at a holding voltage (Vh) of -70 mV (driving force about 70 mV). Spontaneous EPSCs were never observed under condition of Ca(2+)-free solutions, but they persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin. Bath application of quisqualate (500 microM) consistently increased EPSC frequencies. In contrast to the relatively high percentage of RGNs generating spontaneous EPSCs, very few RGNs at P5 (3%, n = 187) displayed inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), although by that time all tested RGNs (n = 14) were responsive to both exogenous Glu and GABA. These results indicate that in the postnatal rat retina development of excitatory synapses precedes the maturation of inhibitory afferents. Excitatory inputs to RGNs were to some extent functional before the animals opened their eyes. Glutamatergic synaptic activity may, thus, play an important role in shaping visual connections in the absence of visual experience.",Excluded

Unfortunately, there are limited treatment options to alleviate this distressing symptom. Preliminary data suggest that the combination of exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and methylphenidate (that is, multimodality therapy [MMT]) can play an important role in reducing CRF. The project's objective is to explore the effects and safety of this MMT on CRF in prostate cancer patients scheduled to receive radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy.

3941,"Thiol activation of endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15. A novel mechanism for the regulation of catalytic activity Endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15 (EP24.15) is a thermolysin-like metalloendopeptidase involved in the regulated metabolism of a number of neuropeptides. Unlike other thermolysin-like peptidases EP24.15 displays a unique thiol activation, a mechanism that is not clearly understood. In this study we show that both recombinant and tissue-derived EP24.15 are activated up to 8-fold by low concentrations (0.1 mM) of dithiothreitol. Additionally, under non-reducing conditions, recombinant and native EP24.15 forms multimers that can be returned to the monomeric form by reduction. We have also shown that competitive inhibitor binding occurs only to the monomeric form, which indicates that catalytic site access is restricted in the multimeric forms. Through systematic site-directed mutagenesis we have identified that cysteine residues 246, 253, and possibly 248 are involved in the formation of these multimers. Furthermore, both a double mutant (C246S/C253S) and a triple mutant (C246S/C248S/C253S) are fully active in the absence of reducing agents, as measured by both inhibitor binding and hydrolysis. The formation and disruption of disulfide bonds involving these cysteine residues may be a mechanism by which EP24.15 activity is regulated through changes in intra- and extracellular redox potential.",Excluded

4038,"Atm knock-in mice harboring an in-frame deletion corresponding to the human ATM 7636del9 common mutation exhibit a variant phenotype ATM, the gene mutated in the human immunodeficiency disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), plays a central role in recognizing ionizing radiation damage in DNA and in controlling several cell cycle checkpoints. We describe here a murine model in which a nine-nucleotide in-frame deletion has been introduced into the Atm gene by homologous recombination followed by removal of the selectable marker cassette by Cre-loxP site-specific, recombination-mediated excision. This mouse, Atm-DeltaSRI, was designed as a model of one of the most common deletion mutations (7636del9) found in A-T patients. The murine Atm deletion results in the loss of three amino acid residues (SRI; 2556-2558) but produces near full-length detectable Atm protein that lacks protein kinase activity. Radiosensitivity was observed in Atm-DeltaSRI mice, whereas the immunological profile of these mice showed greater heterogeneity of T-cell subsets than observed in Atm(-/-) mice. The life span of Atm-DeltaSRI mice was significantly longer than that of Atm(-/-) mice when maintained under nonspecific pathogen-free conditions. This can be accounted for by a lower incidence of thymic lymphomas in Atm-DeltaSRI mice up to 40 weeks, after which time the animals died of other causes. The thymic lymphomas in Atm-DeltaSRI mice were characterized by extensive apoptosis, which appears to be attributable to an increased number of cells expressing Fas ligand. A variety of other tumors including B-cell lymphomas, sarcomas, and carcinomas not seen in Atm(-/-) mice were observed in older Atm-DeltaSRI animals. Thus, expression of mutant protein in Atm-DeltaSRI knock-in mice gives rise to a discernibly different phenotype to Atm(-/-) mice, which may account for the heterogeneity seen in A-T patients with different mutations.",Excluded

Weekly time average dose rate (TADR) were calculated from H*(10) value measured at selective hot spots by irradiating actual treatment plans of mix clinical sites.RESULTS: The maximum total H*(10) were within 2 microSv/hr around CV, 5 microSv/hr around outer wall of BTS which increases up to 62 microSv/hr at the end of inside BTS corridor. Maximum H*(10) of 20.8 microSv/hr in treatment control console (P125), 23.4 microSv/hr behind the common wall between GTR3 and GTR2 (P132) and 25.7 microSv/hr above isocenter (P99) were observed around GTR3. Reduction of beam current from 6 to 3 nA and 1 nA at nozzle exit lead to decrease in total H*(10) at P125 from 20.8 to 11.35 and 4.62 microSv/hr. In comparison to extreme case scenario, H*(10) value at P125, P132 and P99 from clinically relevant irradiation parameters were reduce by a factor ranging from 8.6 for high range cube to 46.4 for brain clinical plan. The maximum weekly TADR per fraction was highest for large volume, sacral chordoma patient at 8.5 microSv/hr compare to 0.3 microSv/hr for brain patient. The calculated weekly TADR for 30 mix clinical cases and 15 fractions of 1 L cube resulted total weekly TADR of 83-84 microSv/hr at P125, P132 and P99. The maximum annual dose level at these hot spots were estimated at 4.37 mSv/Yr.CONCLUSION: We have carried out an extensive measurement of H*(10) under different conditions. The shielding thickness of our PT facility is adequate to limit the dose to occupational worker and general public within the permissible stipulated limit. The data reported here can bridge the knowledge gap in ambient dose around PT facility and can also be used as a reference for any new and existing proton facility for intercomparison and validation.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: First extensive investigation of neutron and photon H*(10) around PT facility and can bridge the knowledge gap on ambient dose.",Excluded
3731,"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) presenting as solitary CNS lymphoma: A rare occurrence Introduction: PTLD associated lymphoma is the second most common malignancy in patients receiving SOT or HSCT with an incidence rate of 1%-3%. PCNS-PTLD occurs in 7%-15% of all PTLD cases. We present a case of isolated PCNS lymphoma two years after renal transplant. Case Description: A 57 year old woman with PMH of ESRD s/p kidney transplant (D/EBV -,R/ EBV +) with chronic CrCl of 30-40% presented with paresthesia and numbness over the right side of her body with mild ataxia 2 years post transplant. Physical exam revealed only numbness over the right side of body. MRI with contrast revealed a left thalamic lesion with moderate vasogenic edema, and MR spectroscopy confirmed high grade neoplasm involving left thalamus. Stereotactic biopsy showed polymorphic CD-20 and EBV positive PTLD. EBV PCR were elevated. Further evaluation ruled out systemic PTLD. Myfortic was stopped and oral steroids started with mild improvement in symptoms. Choice of systemic chemotherapy was limited due to reduced CrCl and risks of graft failure. She received modified regimen with renally adjusted high dose Methotrexate, Vincristine and Rituximab for 6 cycles with partial remission and then Temozolomide for 7 cycles with complete remission. Discussion(s): The incidence of PTLD ranges from 1 to 25% with 90% of cases being EBV-associated, CD20 positive, B cell neoplasms. PCNS-PTLD has a higher incidence in renal SOT, occurs late and is usually monomorphic unlike our patient. Median time of occurrence is 4-5 years after transplant. Risk factors include age, intensity of immunosuppression, time to transplant and EBV status of donor and recipient. Common presenting features include neurological deficits, seizure, and raised intracranial pressure. MRI is the preferred imaging and shows multifocal, ill defined, ring enhancing lesions usually in supratentorial and lobar regions. Positive CSF EBV PCR is highly suggestive but biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Treatment modalities include reduction of immunosuppression, rituximab, high dose methotrexate, cytarabine and cranial radiotherapy. Use of high dose methotrexate has shown improved outcomes with median survival of 26-47 months. Lack of response to first line therapy is considered the dominant prognostic factor. Early recognition and diagnosis remain crucial for improving outcome.",Excluded
4698,"CT perfusion study of vascular response to stereotactic radiosurgery in a preclinical model of glioma PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute changes in tumor and normal brain perfusion following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using computed tomography (CT) perfusion. METHOD(S): C6 glioma cells were implanted into the right caudate nuclei of five Wistar rats. Each rat was treated with 12 Gy of SRS using helical tomotherapy and underwent a CT perfusion scan on day 1 pre-SRS and day 5 post-SRS. Maps of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and permeability-surface area product (PS) were calculated from the CT perfusion studies. After rigid image registrations, the post-SRS CT perfusion maps were subtracted from the pre-SRS CT perfusion maps to produce CBF, CBV, and PS difference maps. Using Otsu's method, we categorized the voxels in the tumor and the peritumoral brain on the PS difference maps as regions of 1) substantial decrease, 2) modest change, and 3) substantial increase. Statistical differences in these regions and in the contralateral brain before and after SRS were tested using the paired t-test. RESULT(S): Using helical tomotherapy, 12 Gy of radiation could be delivered to the tumor, whereas the brainstem dose was < 4 Gy, and < 10% of the contralateral brain received >8 Gy. A significant decrease in PS was observed in voxels that were categorized as ""substantial decrease"" (p = 0.03), and these voxels corresponded to the tumor. We observed a marginally significant increase in PS and CBV (p = 0.07 and 0.08, respectively) in voxels of ""substantial increase,"" and these voxels corresponded to the peritumoral region. No perfusion difference (p > 0.05) was observed in the contralateral brain. CONCLUSION(S): Using CT perfusion, an acute differential vascular response to SRS was observed in the tumor and the peritumoral regions. This finding supports the contention that SRS effects may be mediated in part through the vascular effects of radiation.",Excluded

4151,"The protective effect of dexamethasone against radiation damage induced by interstitial irradiation in normal monkey brain OBJECTIVE: The protective effect of dexamethasone against radiation damage is unclear. We examined the effect of early treatment of high-dose dexamethasone on iridium-192-induced damage to normal brain tissue.METHODS: Brain damage induced by interstitial irradiation with iridium-192 was evaluated with sequential magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 11 adult monkeys, with or without short-term high-dose dexamethasone treatment. Dexamethasone (1 mg/kg of body weight/d) was administered intramuscularly to five irradiated animals every 24 hours, beginning 2 days before and ending 7 days after irradiation. Magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after irradiation.RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging performed 1 week after irradiation revealed marked edema in five nontreated animals. In dexamethasone-treated animals, the volume of edema was reduced significantly, compared to that of nontreated animals, 1 week and 1 month after irradiation. The volume of ring enhancement in dexamethasone-treated animals was also reduced significantly, compared to that of nontreated animals, 3 months after the irradiation. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy spectra revealed that N-acetylaspartate and choline peaks were reduced 1 week after irradiation in both groups. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups at any time points.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that dexamethasone treatment may have an antiedema effect at an early stage and may modify subsequent development of vascular and inflammatory changes but may have no effect of preventing radiation-induced necrosis and the reduction of N-acetylaspartate after brachytherapy.",Included
3984,"Thoracic radiotherapy of SCLC Limited stage: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) comprises 10-15% of all lung tumors and is associated with an aggressive clinical behavior. Two out of three patients presents with hematogenous metastases at diagnosis (extensive stage (ES)). For patients without hematogenous metastases (limited stage (LS)), chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment. Although radiotherapy after chemotherapy has the theoretical benefit of treating smaller target volumes with less toxicity, concurrent chemoradiotherapy has shown to be superior. Moreover, earlier use of radiotherapy during chemotherapy leads to better results. The absolute benefit of early versus late radiotherapy was about 10% for patients who had received cisplatinum-based chemotherapy.1 Turrisi et al.2 demonstrated that twice daily radiotherapy starting with a first course of chemotherapy resulted in improved survival rates. Median survival was 23 months for patients who received twice-daily radiotherapy (45 Gy/30 fractions/3 weeks) versus 19 months for once daily treated patients (45 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks). The corresponding 5 years survival rates were 26% and 16%. However, more Grade 3-4 oesophagitis was seen during twice-daily treatment (32% versus 16%). Only a minority of patients in the US and Europe receive twice daily radiotherapy. Recently the results of the CONVERT trial, in which once-daily radiotherapy (70Gy) was compared with twice daily radiotherapy (45 Gy) were presented.3 Radiotherapy was initiated at the 2nd course of 4-6 cycles of cisplatin/etoposide. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two arms. Overall survival at 2 years was 56% for patients treated twice-daily versus 51% for patients treated once-daily (p= 0.15).3 There was also no significant difference in time to progression. There were no differences in a acute toxicity, except for Grade 3-4 neutropenia, which occurred more often in the twicedaily treatment arm (74% versus 65%). There were no differences in Grade 3-5 oesophagitis (19%) and pneumonitis (2%). The authors concluded that survival in both study arms was higher than reported previously and that radiation related toxicities were lower than expected, probably related to the use of modern radiotherapy techniques. The results of the study support the use of either twice daily or once daily as standard of care for patients with limited stage disease and in good performance score. In RTOG0538 study, which also compares 70 Gy once-daily and 45 Gy twice-daily radiotherapy, radiotherapy commences with the first or second course of chemotherapy. The results of this study are eagerly awaited.4 Extensive stage: In the EORTC study on prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for ES-SCLC, it was noted that the vast majority of patients still had intrathoracic disease after completion of chemotherapy. After on the positive effects of PCI which not only reduced the risk of symptomatic brain metastases (40 versus 15%) but also improved overall survival (1 year: 27 versus 13% (P= 0,003)),5 the next logical step was to investigate the use of thoracic radiotherapy in ES-SCLC as well. Evidence for a possible role of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) in ESSCLC also comes from the results of a trial published by Jeremic et al. in 19996 in which patients with ES-SCLC and good prognosis with a complete response outside the thorax were randomized between TRT plus PCI during chemotherapy versus chemotherapy and PCI only. Overall survival was 17 months for the patients who received thoracic radiotherapy versus 11 months for those who did not. In the CREST trial, patients with ES-SCLC and any response after 4-6 cycles of platinum based chemotherapy were randomized between PCI plus TRT (30Gy/10 fractions) or PCI only. Overall survival at one year, the primary endpoint of the study, was not statistically significant between the groups (p=0.066) but with longer follow up the survival curves diverged and at 2 years, survival was 13% in patients who received TRT versus 3% in the controls (p=0,004). There was also significant dif erence in progression free survival. In an additional analysis of patients with and without residual intrathoracic disease, which was one of the stratification factors of the study, it was demonstrated that there was no significant benefit of TRT in patients with a CR in the thorax. However, in patients with residual intrathoracic disease after chemotherapy, TRT led to a significant improvement in overall survival. 7 In patients who received thoracic radiotherapy the risk of intrathoracic recurrence was reduced from 80% to 44%. In patients who received thoracic radiotherapy the most recurrences occurred outside the brain and the thorax and at a later stage. The next logical step after demonstration of a beneficial effect of PCI and TRT would be the use of higher doses for TRT and possibly also treatment of extrathoracic metastatic sites. This topic was addressed in the NRG-RTOG0937 study and was presented at ASTRO 2015.8 patients with ES-SCLC and a CR or PR after chemotherapy and 1-4 metastatic lesions were randomized between PCI or PCI plus TRT plus radiotherapy of metastatic sites. The study which accrued very slowly was closed early due to observed toxicities. The study did not show a survival difference between the two groups, but included only 86 patients over a five years period and had imbalance groups with worse prognostic factors in the experimental arm. There were many, partly unrelated, Grade 4-5 toxicities in the experimental arm. To define which patients are most likely to benefit from a more aggressive approach we have performed an additional analysis for patients from the top accruing centers from the CREST trial. An evaluation of 260 patients showed significantly better outcome in patients with 0 to 2 metastases versus and without liver metastases.10 These patients are believed to be best candidates for future studies.",Excluded

The present investigation was designed to evaluate the feasibility of single photon emission tomography (SPET) with IPA to image brain tumours under routine clinical conditions. Using a dual- and a triple-headed SPET camera, whole-body kinetic and brain SPET, as well as plasma, urinary and dosimetric analysis were determined in four patients with gliomas after intravenous injection of IPA. Results obtained by IPA SPET were retrospectively compared with histopathology, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography with [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose. Tumour lesions were clearly demonstrated by IPA SPET at 30 min, 1 h and 4.5 h post-injection, even in patients with low grade gliomas. In patients with glioblastoma, excellent visualization of the tumour was possible even at 7 h p.i., indicative of the high retention of the radiopharmaceutical in cerebral gliomas. Analysis of the radioactivity in plasma and urine attested to the high in vivo stability of IPA. Blood clearance was rapid (> 65% after 10 min) and IPA was excreted predominantly by the kidneys, the urinary radioactivity excretion ranging from 27% at 1 h to 54% of injected doses at 5 h p.i. The average effective dose for adults was estimated to be 0.0152 mSv.MBq<sup>-1</sup>, leading to an effective dose of 3.8 mSv in a typical brain SPET investigation with 250 MBq IPA. This result strongly suggests that IPA is a potentially valuable brain tumour imaging agent for widespread clinical studies with SPET. Its high specific tumour uptake and retention even in low grade gliomas represent a major advantage compared to presently available SPET radiopharmaceuticals. Moreover, the radiation dose estimates indicate that clinical use of IPA will result in acceptable radiation dose levels in humans. (© 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins).",Excluded
3934,"Lack of promoting effects of chronic exposure to 1.95-GHz W-CDMA signals for IMT-2000 cellular system on development of N-ethylnitrosourea-induced central nervous system tumors in F344 rats The present study was performed to evaluate effects of a 2-year exposure to an electromagnetic near-field (EMF) equivalent to that generated by cellular phones on tumor development in the central nervous system (CNS) of rats. For this purpose, pregnant F344 rats were given a single administration of N-ethylnitrosourea (ENU) on gestational day 18. A total of 500 pups were divided into five groups, each composed of 50 males and 50 females: Group 1, untreated controls; Group 2, ENU alone; Groups 3 to 5, ENU + EMF (sham exposure and two exposure levels). A 1.95-GHz wide-band code division multiple access (W-CDMA) signal, which is a feature of the International Mobile Telecommunication 2000 (IMT-2000) cellular system was employed for exposure of the rat head starting from 5 weeks of age, 90 min a day, 5 days a week, for 104 weeks. Brain average specific absorption rates (SARs) were designed to be .67 and 2.0 W/kg for low and high exposures, respectively. The incidence and numbers of brain tumors in female rats exposed to 1.95-GHz W-CDMA signals showed tendencies to increase but without statistical significance. Overall, no significant increase in incidences or numbers, either in the males or females, was detected in the EMF-exposed groups. In addition, no clear changes in tumor types in the brain were evident. Thus, under the present experimental conditions, exposure of heads of rats to 1.95-GHz W-CDMA signals for IMT-2000 for a 2-year period was not demonstrated to accelerate or otherwise affect ENU-initiated brain tumorigenesis.",Excluded
4321,"Focal, high dose, and fractionated modified stereotactic radiation therapy for lung carcinoma patients: a preliminary experience BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiation therapy is highly effective in the treatment of small brain metastases, regardless of the histology. This suggests that small extracranial malignancies may be curable with similar radiation therapy. The authors developed a novel treatment unit for administering such therapy.METHODS: The unit consisted of a linear accelerator (linac), an X-ray simulator (X-S), computed tomography (CT), and a table. The gantry axes of the three machines were coaxial and could be matched by rotating the table. Patients were instructed to perform shallow respiration with oxygen. The motion of the tumor was monitored with the X-S. When the motion was slight enough, the table was rotated to the CT. To include all geometric movement on the CT images, each scan was made while the patient was performing shallow respiration. After the CT positioning, the table was rotated to the linac, and non-coplanar treatment was given. Beginning in October 1994, 45 patients with 23 primary or 43 metastatic lung carcinomas were treated. Radiation doses at the 80% isodose line were 30-75 gray in 5-15 fractions over 1-3 weeks with or without conventional radiation therapy.RESULTS: The treatment was performed with no or minimal adverse acute symptoms. The daily treatment time was short. During a median follow-up of 11 months, local progression occurred in 2 of 66 lesions. Interstitial changes in the lung were limited.CONCLUSIONS: With this unit and procedure, focal radiation therapy similar to stereotactic radiation therapy is possible for extracranial sites. The preliminary experience appeared safe and promising, and further exploration of this approach is warranted.",Excluded

Type A IOLs (convex-plano), except for those with high power, had the smallest spherical aberration. Type B IOLs (biconvex, anterior more curved) had the smallest spherical aberration at high power. Type D IOLs (biconvex, posterior more curved) had the largest spherical aberration. The correlation between glare disability and spherical aberration was statistically significant for types A, B and C (equiconvex) IOLs. There was no correlation between glare disability and spherical aberration for Type D IOLs, although they showed the smallest glare disability of the four types. These results indicate that the spherical aberration of an IOL, which is calculated by an optical design program, may be a good criterion for selecting an IOL design.",Excluded
4196,"Thymoquinone reduces oxidative and nitrosative stress in tongue-tissue of rats exposed to total cranial irradiation Introduction: Head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy suffer severe side-effects during and following their treatment. Efforts to decrease toxicity of irradiation to normal tissue, organs and cells have led to a search for cytoprotective agent. Investigations for effective and non-toxic compounds with radioprotective capability led to increasing interest in antioxidant such as thymoquinone (TQ). Objective(s): The aim of this study was to evaluate the radioprotective effects of TQ on oxidant/antioxidant systems in the tongue-tissue of rats exposed to total cranial irradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-two rats were divided into four groups to test the radioprotective effectiveness of TQ administered by either orogastric tube or intraperitoneal injection. Appropriate control groups were also studied. Result(s): Tongue glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), total superoxide scavenger activity (TSSA), non-enzymatic superoxide scavenger activity (NSSA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the control and sham control groups were significantly increased when compared to the irradiation (IR) group and IR plus TQ groups. Nitric oxide (NO*), peroxynitrite (ONOO-) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, xantine oxidase (XO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities significantly increased in the IR group when compared to the control and sham control groups. Conclusion(s): Results show that TQ has the radioprotective, antioxidant effects and free radical scavenging activity. Therapy with antioxidants may lead to the increase in the antioxidant defense system and thus, may decrease the clinical symptoms in radiation therapy.",Included

3739,"Potassium currents in isolated statocyst neurons and RPeD1 in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis To begin to determine the underlying neural mechanisms of memory formation, we studied two different cell types that play important roles in different forms of associative learning in Lymnaea. Statocyst neurons (hair cells) mediate classical conditioning, whereas RPeD1 is a site of memory formation induced by operant conditioning of aerial respiration. Because potassium (K(+)) channels play a critical role in neuronal excitability, we initiated studies on these channels in the aforementioned neurons. Three distinct K(+) currents are expressed in the soma of both the hair cells and RPeD1. In hair cells and RPeD1, there is a fast activating and rapidly inactivating 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-sensitive A current (I(A)), a tetraethyl ammonium (TEA)-sensitive delayed rectifying current, which exhibits slow inactivation kinetics (I(KV)), and a TEA- and 4-AP-insensitive Ca(2+)-dependent current (I(Ca-K)). In hair cells, the activation voltage of I(A); its half-maximal steady-state activation voltage and its half-maximal steady-state inactivation were at more depolarized levels than in RPeD1. The time constant of recovery from I(A) inactivation was slightly faster in hair cells. I(A) in hair cells is also smaller in amplitude than in RPeD1 and is activated at more depolarized potentials. In like manner, I(KV) is smaller in hair cells and is activated at more depolarized potentials than in RPeD1.",Excluded
4520,"Daxx Functions Are p53-Independent In Vivo Mutations in the death domain-associated protein (DAXX) have been recently identified in a substantial proportion of human pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). Remarkably, however, little is known about the physiologic role(s) of DAXX despite in vitro studies suggesting potential functions. Most prominently, and supported by tumor sequencing data, DAXX functions in concert with alpha thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) as a histone chaperone complex for the H3.3 variant. Studies have also identified potential roles in apoptosis, transcription, and negative regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. Herein, a mouse modeling approach was used to specifically address the latter and no significant genetic interaction between Daxx and the p53 pathway was determined. The embryonic lethal phenotype of Daxx loss is not p53-dependent. In addition, Daxx heterozygosity does not sensitize mice to a sublethal dose of ionizing radiation or alter the survival or tumor phenotype of Mdm2 transgenic mice. However, the data support a tumor suppressor role for DAXX as low-dose ionizing radiation produced a higher proportion of carcinomas in Daxx heterozygous mice than wild-type controls. <b>Implications:</b> While DAXX has important in vivo functions, they are independent of an inhibitory role on the p53 tumor suppressor pathway.

A recommended diagnostic workup Background: Patients admitted for suspicion of shunt dysfunction (SD) often show unspecific symptoms and require time-consuming, expensive and even invasive diagnostics involving significant radiation exposure. The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the current diagnostic procedures and to propose a process optimisation. Method(s): As all patients admitted for suspicion of SD receive imaging studies, we searched for adult patients receiving neuroimaging in the period from January 2010 to July 2013, analysing referring diagnosis, clinical signs, products, diagnostic process and final diagnosis. Recursive partitioning was used to define time intervals for differentiating types of SD. Result(s): A total of 148 patients, aged 18-89 (mean, 54) years, were studied. Forty-two percent were referred by a hospital or rehabilitation centre, 30% by general practitioners and 24% were self-referrals. The admission diagnosis was in the majority ""shunt dysfunction"" only. Further differentiations were rarely made. An SD was confirmed in 46% of the patients. In 17%, the symptoms were based on another cause and in 37% they could not be clearly attributed to any specific disorder. Abdominal dislocations (2%) and shunt infections (5%) were found within the first 6 months. Over- (3%) and under-drainage (14%) were the most frequent complications during the first 4 years. Disconnections (13%) occurred generally 4 years or more after implantation. Only shunt obstruction (9%) showed no temporal pattern. Conclusion(s): Symptoms of SD remain mostly unspecific. This study showed that the type of SD depends on the time interval from implantation. We propose a workup strategy for patients with SD based on the temporal profile.

Moreover, hormesis by LS has revealed: in males irradiation with 0.25, 0.75 and 1 Gy increased the mean LS, and with 0.25 and 0.5 Gy caused the maximum LS; in females exposures with 0.25, 0.75 and 2 Gy increased the maximum LS. The densitometric assay of DNA electrophoregrams showed decrease by 39.2% of the part of high-molecular-weight DNA in control as a result of S1-nuclease action. Samples of DNA from the irradiated flies were more stable to enzyme action. The higher stability of DNA originated from the irradiated flies could be the result of reparation system activation.

4443,"Automatic image segmentation for 3D dosimetry in Lu177-DOTATATE PRRT using a robust cluster algorithm on dynamic SPECT data Aim: In Lu-177-DOTATATE PRRT the estimation of dosimetric values for tumours and radiation sensitive organs such as the kidneys supports individualized therapies. For this purpose a volume-of-interest (VOI) for each entity has to be defined in image data, acquired at days 1, 2 and 3 p.i. We have studied a method to automatically segment tumour and kidney VOIs in 4D SPECT data compared to manually defined VOIs. Material(s) and Method(s): Three patients (mean 70.7y) with neuroendocrine tumours who received 7.4GBq of Lu-177 DOTATATE were imaged with a Dual-head SPECT/CT (Siemens Symbia T2) with 20s/step in 64 steps/head. The CT image taken at day 1 was coregistered to each SPECT dataset and utilized for attenuation correction in penalized OSEM reconstruction employing compensation for distance dependent detector blur and photon scatter. The three SPECT volumes were synthesized to form a 4D SPECT study. A robust k-means cluster algorithm was used to automatically detect eight clusters in these dynamic image data, followed by a labeller to segment each individual connected VOI. For comparison, three to five tumours and two kidney VOIs were manually defined for each patient and an auto contour at the 40% of maximum value was applied. Based on the mean time-activity curves of each selected VOI a 3D dose map was calculated using S-value convolution kernels (Monte Carlo simulation in soft tissue). Result(s): The automatic segmentation successfully found 11 out of 12 tumour VOIs and three out of six kidney cortex VOIs. The missed entities can be addressed to overlapping with surrounding high-activity VOIs, mainly tumours and spleen. The mean dose values of the 11 tumours were 17.2+/-9.1Gy with the automatic and 16.5+/-9.1Gy with the manual method. The estimated dose to the cortex of the three successfully segmented kidneys was 9.7+/-1.7Gy with the automatic and 8.7+/-1.1Gy with the manual method. We found a strong correlation (rho=0.8) and no significant difference (paired t-test) between the dose estimates of both methods. Conclusion(s): The automatic segmentation is a promising approach to reduce the effort to generate dose estimates in PRRT. Nevertheless we observed that the position of kidneys can significantly change between measurement days, hindering an accurate coregistration on the voxel or organ boundary level. These misregistered boundaries can result in false segmentation and dosimetric results.

Retrospective studies report conflicting results on the effect of radiotherapy dose escalation on response and time to progression in symptomatic metastatic disease; studies using the linear quadratic model have used alpha/beta ratios that are inappropriate for slow growing tumours. We aim to describe our experience with palliative radiotherapy in this context, relating Biological Effective Dose to outcome.MATERIALS AND METHODS: From December 1995 to April 2001, 143 independent palliative radiotherapy treatments were delivered to 78 patients in a single institution. Retrospective data was obtained on the radiotherapy schedule used, symptom response and time to symptom progression. The biological effective dose (BED) was calculated using alpha/beta ratios of 3 and 7 Gy (BED3 and BED7). The Log-Rank test was used to assess any differences in time to progression, and the Cox Proportional Hazards analysis to determine prognostic factors of time to progression.RESULTS: Overall symptomatic response rate was 73%, with most responses being partial (67%). Forty-three (38%) patients had symptomatic progression after a median follow-up of 425 days. BED (BED3 or BED7) was not significantly different across response types (complete, partial or no response; P=0.90 and 0.88, respectively) and was not predictive for time to symptomatic progression (P=0.99 for BED3 and P=0.70 for BED7). Patients with bone metastases received less total dose (P=0.001), less BED (BED3, P=0.0013, and BED7, P=0.0005) and had a significantly longer time to progression than other sites of metastases (hazard ratio (HR) 0.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.7; P=0.004). Initial treatment with interferon-alpha alone in patients presenting with metastatic disease, before palliative radiotherapy, was also associated with a shorter time to symptom progression (HR 4.6; 95% CI 1.5-14.1; P=0.007). On removal of these criteria, brain metastases became a significant predictor of progression time, with an HR of 2.5 (95% CI 1.0-5.9; P=0.05), showing an increased risk of progression with brain metastases compared with metastases elsewhere. Time from primary diagnosis to development of metastatic disease was not predictive of time to symptom progression (P=0.29).CONCLUSION: Despite the widespread assumption that renal cell carcinoma is radioresistant, retrospective assessment showed high response rates to palliative radiotherapy. On the basis of our data, higher BED does not seem to be a predictor of response or of duration of response in the palliative treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Palliation of bone pain seems to be particularly durable compared with the palliation of symptoms at other sites of metastases. A trend for shorter duration of palliative effect of whole-brain radiotherapy was noted.",Excluded
4788,"Photoresponse diversity among the five types of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) mediate non-image-forming visual responses, including pupillary constriction, circadian photoentrainment and suppression of pineal melatonin secretion. Five morphological types of ipRGCs, M1-M5, have been identified in mice. In order to understand their functions better, we studied the photoresponses of all five cell types, by whole-cell recording from fluorescently labelled ipRGCs visualized using multiphoton microscopy. All ipRGC types generated melanopsin-based ('intrinsic') as well as synaptically driven ('extrinsic') light responses. The intrinsic photoresponses of M1 cells were lower threshold, higher amplitude and faster than those of M2-M5. The peak amplitudes of extrinsic light responses differed among the ipRGC types; however, the responses of all cell types had comparable thresholds, kinetics and waveforms, and all cells received rod input. While all five types exhibited inhibitory amacrine-cell and excitatory bipolar-cell inputs from the 'on' channel, M1 and M3 received additional 'off'-channel inhibition, possibly through their 'off'-sublamina dendrites. The M2-M5 ipRGCs had centre-surround-organized receptive fields, implicating a capacity to detect spatial contrast. In contrast, the receptive fields of M1 cells lacked surround antagonism, which might be caused by the surround of the inhibitory input nullifying the surround of the excitatory input. All ipRGCs responded robustly to a wide range of motion speeds, and M1-M4 cells appeared tuned to different speeds, suggesting that they might analyse the speed of motion. Retrograde labelling revealed that M1-M4 cells project to the superior colliculus, suggesting that the contrast and motion information signalled by these cells could be used by this sensorimotor area to detect novel objects and motion in the visual field.",Excluded

The effects on tumour growth, the efficiency of i.a. infusion, the efficacy of retention of microspheres in the primary tumour and the excretion of free holmium-166 were analyzed. Complete tumour remissions were obtained in 79% and 86% following embolization with radioactive and inactive microspheres, respectively. Over 95% of the microspheres were retained in the tumour and the leaching of holmium-166 in urine and faeces was less than 0.1% in 2 days. The injection efficiency was not optimal, as 40% of the microspheres were retained in the cannulation system. Arterio-arteriolar connections should be detected and closed prior to embolization to prevent stray emboli from entering the brain. It is concluded that 166HoPLA microspheres are promising candidates for further studies on radio-embolization of unresectable head-and-neck cancer.",Excluded
4163,"Evaluation of QOL and psychological response in patients treated with palliative radiotherapy Purpose or Objective Usually, evaluation of palliative radiotherapy is made by physical findings or levels of pain relief. But little is known about patient quality of life (QOL), psychophysiological response, and assessment of adverse effect from the view point of QOL. We evaluated the effects of palliative radiotherapy for cancer recurrence or metastasis on patient QOL and psychophysiology. Material and Methods A total of 67 patients who received palliative radiotherapy between 2014 and 2015 were enrolled. Patient diseases were bone metastasis in 51 patients, lymph node metastasis in 7 patients, brain metastasis in 2 patients, local recurrence in 3 patients, and the others in 4 patients. Median irradiated dose was 30 Gy in 10 fractions for palliative radiotherapy. We used the questionnaires EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-C15-PAL to evaluate patient QOL and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate patient mental healthcare at the start and at the end of radiotherapy. Results As compared to scores at the start of radiotherapy, at the end of radiotherapy, numerical rating scale (NRS) and face scale significantly decreased. On the other hand, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) did not show no changes during palliative radiotherapy. In functional scales, average scores of role functioning (RF2) and emotional functioning (EF) also improved. In symptom scales, average scores of fatigue (FA), pain (PA), and insomnia (SL) improved. In bone metastasis group, global health status / QOL (QL2), PA, and SL significantly improved. After palliative radiotherapy, anxiety score of HADS was elevated below age of 70 years. There was relationship between anxiety improvement and QOL improvement after palliative radiotherapy. Nausea and vomiting scores of EORTC-QLQC15- PAL were associated with the irradiated volume of palliative radiotherapy for pelvic region. Conclusion Patient QOL of was improved by palliative radiotherapy regardless of PS. The possibility of palliative radiotherapy having a positive influence on patient psychophysiology was also suggested in younger age.",Excluded
4803,"The dual-peak light response of ganglion cells in chicken retina In the present study, a particular temporal pattern of the ganglion cells' light response specified as ""dual-peak"" was observed. In the chicken retina (N=15), about 37.5% (174 out of 464) of the ganglion cells showed such special temporal property in response to the onset of light flash. These neurons responded to light stimulus with two successive components: a transient increase of firing rate which lasted for less than 100 ms, and another prolonged light response appeared in about 100 ms after the first transient response. Moreover, our data demonstrated a temporal adaptation process in the later phase of firing activities when repeated flashes were applied. Meanwhile, the earlier phase had a more stable latency in response to the stimulus. Application of picrotoxin could evoke the dual-peak responses in transient ganglion cells. These results suggest that the origination of the two response components might be distinct and the later one is likely related to GABAergic pathways.",Excluded
4263,"Olfactory testing in staff working in the cardiac catheterization laboratory Background: In the absence of specific protection, invasive cardiologists receive a high lifetime head exposure, with organ doses in the 1 to 3 Sievert range (equivalent to the risk of 50,000 to 150,000 chest x-rays). Radiation exposure in this dose range can reduce neurogenesis in adult brain and negatively impact on olfactory function, whose impairment is a recognized early biomarker of neurode-generative disease. Aim(s): To assess psychological testing results in exposed subjects (ES) working as staff in the Cath Lab compared with non-exposed matched controls (NES). Method(s): A complete olfactory test battery (Sniffin' Sticks Extended test) was performed in 130 Cath Lab ES (60 males; age=44.9+/-8.7 years; 58 interventional cardiologists, 60 nurses, 12 technicians). A control group of age- and gendermatched non-exposed subjects (NES) was also studied. Result(s): ES showed lower scores in the Odor Threshold test (p=.006), Discrimination test (p=.039), Identification test (p=.005) and TDI (the sum of the previous 3 tests, p<.001), as reported in Figure. Subnormal scores of at least 1 of 3 odor subtests were present in 18/130 ES and 7/130 NES (13.8 vs 5.4%, p<.001). Significant correlations were found between Identification Score and years at Cath Lab (r=-.18, p=.012), this last parameter being also correlated with the overall TDI Score (r=-.16, p=.048).

CT images, structure sets, and dose files were transferred to the Eclipse treatment planning system for the HyperArc system. Dosimetric parameters for both plans were compared. The beam-on time was calculated from the total monitor unit and dose rate.RESULTS: For normal brain tissue, the received volume doses were significantly lower for HyperArc than for CyberKnife_G4 and strongly correlated with the planning target volume (PTV) for cases of single brain metastasis. In addition, the difference in volume dose between CyberKnife_G4 and HyperArc was proportional to the PTV. For multiple brain metastases, no significant difference was observed between the two stereotactic radiosurgery systems, except for high-dose region in the normal tissue. In low dose for brain minus PTV, when the maximum distance among each target was above 8.0 cm, HyperArc delivered higher dose than CyberKnife_G4. The mean +/- SDs for the beam-on time were 15.8 +/- 5.3 and 5.6 +/- 0.8 min for CyberKnife_G4 and HyperArc, respectively (p < .01).CONCLUSION: HyperArc is best suited for larger targets in single brain metastasis and for smaller inter tumor tumor distances in multiple brain metastases.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The performance of HyperArc in comparison with CyberKnife_G4 was depended on defined margin and tumor distances.",Excluded
3645,"Radiation therapy for melanoma: Adjuvant, palliative and abscopal effects Radiation therapy (RT) has long played a role in the management of melanoma, however historically its efficacy has been questioned due to the perceived radioresistance of melanoma cells in vitro. Apart from proton therapy for choroidal melanoma, RT has limited accepted indications as a definitive treatment. Surgery remains the first line therapy of choice for operable patients and adjuvant RT can be considered for high-risk primary tumours. Prospective randomised data are awaited following a Phase II TROG study reporting high local control rates (93%) following postoperative nodal irradiation in selected patients with node-positive melanoma. High response rates of melanoma (e.g. mucosal or inoperable) to primary radiotherapy have also been reported. Local radiation can achieve tumour-antigen release and clinical results suggest biological interaction with immunomodulating agents (a checkpoint inhibitor and anti-CTLA4 antibody), corroborated by preclinical data. Much interest also lies in enhancing melanoma radiation response rates through combination with clinical hyperthermia, which can achieve radiosensitisation, at least in part, by immune modulation. Novel developments in radiotherapy include the rise in radiosurgical treatment (SRS), involving high dose, small volume irradiation. SRS is increasingly the palliation of choice for patients with two or more brain metastases, following resection of a single brain metastasis and for extra-cranial oligometastases. The results of a Phase III trial evaluating whole brain radiotherapy are awaited. The radiobiological consequences of SRS may be even more immunomodulatory, congruent with retrospective data that fraction sizes greater than 4 Gray are more effective and SRS alone has been suggested to induce an abscopal effect. To date there are limited data reporting SRS with concomitant immunomodulators and the optimal combinations remain to be defined. Serious toxicities have been reported following administration of B-RAF inhibitors with and subsequent to both SRS and fractionated RT. Combination strategies are being actively researched as these should increase the effectiveness of radiation in the management of patients with melanoma by widening the therapeutic window between normal tissue toxicity and melanoma cell kill, and by potentially inducing an out-offield abscopal effect.",Excluded

Pathologically it is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neuronal loss within the brain tissue of affected individuals. It is now widely hypothesised that fibrillar structures represent an inert structure. Biophysical and toxicity assays attempting to characterize the formation of both the fibrillar and the intermediate oligomeric structures of Abeta typically involves preparing samples which are largely monomeric; the most common method by which this is achieved is to use the fluorinated organic solvent 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP). Recent evidence has suggested that this method is not 100% effective in producing an aggregate free solution. We show, using dynamic light scattering, size exclusion chromatography and small angle X-ray scattering that this is indeed the case, with HFIP pretreated Abeta peptide solutions displaying an increased proportion of oligomeric and aggregated material and an increased propensity to aggregate. Furthermore we show that an alternative technique, involving treatment with strong alkali results in a much more homogenous solution that is largely monomeric. These techniques for solubilising and controlling the oligomeric state of Abeta are valuable starting points for future biophysical and toxicity assays. © 2013 Ryan et al.",Excluded

In vivo imaging of these receptors with selective 5HT4R radiotracers and PET would be valuable to investigate alterations in 5HT4R in different brain disorders and to assist drug discovery. In this study, (18)F-MNI698 was evaluated as a potential PET radiotracer for imaging of 5HT4R in the brain.METHODS: Eighteen PET studies were performed in 3 adult rhesus monkeys. The radiotracer was administered as a bolus intravenous injection or bolus plus constant infusion (time that would be required to inject the bolus at the infusion rate = 60 min), and arterial blood was collected for data quantification. Kinetic models were used to estimate distribution volumes and binding potentials, for which the cerebellum was used as a reference region. (18)F-MNI698 test-retest variability and upper mass dose limits were determined. Preblocking studies using several doses of SB204070, a selective 5HT4R antagonist, were performed.RESULTS: (18)F-MNI698 avidly entered the monkey brain (peak percentage injected dose of ~ 6.6%), and its brain distribution was consistent with known 5HT4R densities. At 120 min after bolus injection and after the start of radiotracer infusion, only less than 5% and approximately 10% parent compound was present in blood, respectively. Measured binding potentials were underestimated by 22%-36% when noninvasive methods were used for data quantification in comparison with invasive methods. A good agreement was found between test-retest measurements. The radiotracer upper mass dose limit (<5% occupancy) was determined to be 13.1 mug per 70 kg of body weight. SB204070 blocked the radiotracer binding in a dose-dependent manner.CONCLUSION: Data indicate that (18)F-MNI698 is a promising PET radiotracer for imaging of 5HT4R in the brain, and human studies are warranted based on these study results.",Excluded

The distribution of the induced electric field was computed, and estimates of the relevant parameters were generated to predict the locus and type of neurons stimulated during TMS, assuming three different stimulation mechanisms.RESULTS: Tissue heterogeneity strongly affects the spatial distribution of the induced electric field and hence which stimulation mechanism is dominant and where it acts. Stimulation of neurons may occur in the gyrus, in the lip of the gyrus, and in the walls of the sulcus. The stimulated cells can be either pyramidal cells having medium to large caliber axons, or intracortical fibers of medium caliber.CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the influence of cortical folding on the action of magnetic and electric fields on cortical tissue.SIGNIFICANCE: Tissue geometry and heterogeneity in electrical conductivity both must be taken into account to predict accurately stimulation loci and mechanism in TMS.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of RF-EMR on the brain mechanism of rats by recording local field potentials (LFPs) signals during working memory (WM) task. Subjects were exposed to 900 MHz from a dipole antenna daily for three hours. Exposure was applied, first on a short term base (1 week) and then on a long term base (4 weeks). Behavioral parameters were measured weekly while rats performed T-maze tasks in two types of normal and delayed. LFPs signals were simultaneously recorded by implanted microelectrode arrays on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats. Results showed a significant increase (*p < 0.05) in the task completion time of exposed rats which vanished shortly after the end of short term RF-EMR exposure. Before exposure, during correctly performed delayed tasks, an increase (peak) in power changes of theta band (4-12 Hz) was observed. But during correctly performed normal tasks, an increase appeared only by applying RF-EMR exposure. The similarity in power changes pattern of theta band in both types of tasks was observed after long term exposure. Classification accuracy of LFPs in truly done normal and delayed tasks was compared in pre and post-exposure states. Initial classification accuracy was 84.2 % which decreased significantly (*P < 0.05) after exposure. These observations indicated that RF-EMR may cause unusual brain functioning which is temporary at least for short term exposure. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

3850,"Cerebral Cortex Regions Selectively Vulnerable to Radiation Dose-Dependent Atrophy PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: Neurologic deficits after brain radiation therapy (RT) typically involve decline in higher-order cognitive functions such as attention and memory rather than sensory defects or paralysis. We sought to determine whether areas of the cortex critical to cognition are selectively vulnerable to radiation dose-dependent atrophy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We measured change in cortical thickness in 54 primary brain tumor patients who underwent fractionated, partial brain RT. The study patients underwent high-resolution, volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (T1-weighted; T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, FLAIR) before RT and 1 year afterward. Semiautomated software was used to segment anatomic regions of the cerebral cortex for each patient. Cortical thickness was measured for each region before RT and 1 year afterward. Two higher-order cortical regions of interest (ROIs) were tested for association between radiation dose and cortical thinning: entorhinal (memory) and inferior parietal (attention/memory). For comparison, 2 primary cortex ROIs were also tested: pericalcarine (vision) and paracentral lobule (somatosensory/motor). Linear mixed-effects analyses were used to test all other cortical regions for significant radiation dose-dependent thickness change. Statistical significance was set at alpha = 0.05 using 2-tailed tests.RESULTS: Cortical atrophy was significantly associated with radiation dose in the entorhinal (P=.01) and inferior parietal ROIs (P=.02). By contrast, no significant radiation dose-dependent effect was found in the primary cortex ROIs (pericalcarine and paracentral lobule). In the whole-cortex analysis, 9 regions showed significant radiation dose-dependent atrophy, including areas responsible for memory, attention, and executive function (P<=.002).CONCLUSIONS: Areas of cerebral cortex important for higher-order cognition may be most vulnerable to radiation-related atrophy. This is consistent with clinical observations that brain radiation patients experience deficits in domains of memory, executive function, and attention. Correlations of regional cortical atrophy with domain-specific cognitive functioning in prospective trials are warranted.",Excluded

For most patients, the index CT scan was the only one received over an 11-year period. However, 28.4% of patients received 1 or more CT brain scans during the preceding decade and 6.7% received 1 or more CT brain scans during the subsequent year. Of the 473 patients (75.9%) whose index scan was ordered by a primary care physician, most (80.3%) did not see a specialist during follow-up. One patient with an indeterminate finding on the index scan was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor (0.2%), and 6 patients (1.0%) died during follow-up. Among the 4 deaths in which the cause could be determined, none were due to central nervous system causes.CONCLUSION: because of the potential risk of cancer from exposure to ionizing radiation, efforts should be made to avoid CT scanning for headache when the likelihood of serious illness is low.

There is little information, however, about the direct effect of night work on the risk of cancer. We investigated the effect of night work in breast cancer.METHODS: We examined the relationship between breast cancer and working on rotating night shifts during 10 years of follow-up in 78 562 women from the Nurses' Health Study. Information was ascertained in 1988 about the total number of years during which the nurses had worked rotating night shifts with at least three nights per month. From June 1988 through May 1998, we documented 2441 incident breast cancer cases. Logistic regression models were used to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for confounding variables and breast cancer risk factors.

3710,"Presynaptic serotonergic modulation of 5-HT and acetylcholine release in the hippocampus and the cortex of 5-HT1B-receptor knockout mice Lesioning of serotonergic afferents increases hippocampal ACh release and attenuates memory deficits produced by cholinergic lesions. Improved memory performance described in 5-HT1B-knockout (KO) mice might thus be due to a weaker 5-HT1B-mediated inhibitory influence of 5-HT on hippocampal ACh release. The selective delay-dependent impairment of working memory observed in these KO mice suggests, however, that cortical regions also participate in task performance, possibly via indirect influences of 5-HT on ACh release. To provide neuropharmacological support for these hypotheses we measured evoked ACh and 5-HT release in hippocampal and cortical slices of wild-type (WT) and 5-HT1B KO mice. Superfused slices (preincubated with [3H]choline or [3H]5-HT) were electrically stimulated in the absence or presence of 5-HT1B receptor ligands. In hippocampus and cortex, 5-HT1B agonists decreased and antagonists increased 5-HT release in WT, but not in 5-HT1B KO mice. In 5-HT1B KO mice, 5-HT release was enhanced in both structures, while ACh release (in nCi) was reduced.

4366,"Cryptochromes and inner retinal non-visual irradiance detection Nearly all circadian clocks have free-running periods that differ significantly from 24 hours. To maintain synchrony with the 24 h day, the mammalian circadian clock is reset by light. Unlike other animals, mammalian circadian entrainment occurs exclusively via the eyes and optic nerves. Remarkably, the classical photoreceptors--the rods and cones--are not necessary for photic entrainment. Instead, a subset of inner retinal ganglion cells are directly photoresponsive and transmit photic information specifically to brain centres involved in irradiance detection, including the master circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. The photopigment(s) responsible for inner retinal phototransduction are unknown. Several lines of evidence constrain candidate photopigments. First, near-total vitamin A depletion does not diminish retinohypothalamic signalling. Second, loss of cryptochrome function in retinal-degenerate mice substantially decreases photic signalling to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and markedly decreases pupillary light responses. Third, vitamin A depletion of cryptochrome mutant mice leads to loss of photic signalling to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These findings suggest a model where either classical photopigments or inner retinal photopigments are sufficient for non-visual irradiance detection.",Excluded
3723,"Cytogenetic comparison of the sensitivity to mutagens in mice selected for high (HA) and low (LA) swim stress-induced analgesia Sensitivity to mutagens was studied in mouse lines selectively bred for high analgesia (HA) and for low analgesia (LA) induced by 3-min swimming in 20 degrees C water. Apart from pain-related traits HA mice also manifest, as compared to the LA line, higher emotionality in various behavioural tests, and cope worse with the hypothermic challenge of swimming in cold water. In the present study HA mice appeared more susceptible to the mutagenic effect of whole-body gamma-radiation and mitomycin-C injection. Both treatments caused higher frequencies of chromosomal aberrations and micronucleus in bone marrow cells in the HA than in the LA line. The results are discussed in terms of a genetic correlation between animals' susceptibility to environmental stressors and the mechanism of mutagenesis. As shown by our recent molecular study, the selection for magnitude of swim analgesia has differentiated the parental outbred population into two distinct genotypes characterised by specific minisatellite and microsatellite sequences for each line, which may be genetic markers of particular traits. We conceive that the breeding strategy, along with the differentiation of stress-related phenomena, has altered the frequencies of genes controlling DNA repair in each line.",Excluded
4352,"A role for hydrolysis of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in terminating the response to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and to a flash of light in Limulus ventral photoreceptors Injection of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins 1,4,5-P3) into Limulus ventral photoreceptors produces excitation similar to that produced by light. One process which might contribute to rapid termination of the responses to Ins 1,4,5-P3 and to light is the hydrolysis of Ins 1,4,5-P3 by an InsP3-5-phosphatase to form inositol 1,4-bisphosphate. Inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins 2,4,5-P3) is known to be less hydrolysable by the InsP3-5-phosphatase than is Ins 1,4,5-P3. Whereas ventral photoreceptors respond to an injection of Ins 1,4,5-P3 with a single wave of depolarization, the response to Ins 2,4,5-P3 is a burst of waves of depolarization. Our hypothesis is that it is the resistance to hydrolysis by the InsP3-5-phosphatase which accounts for the burst of waves produced by Ins 2,4,5-P3. To test this idea we injected ventral photoreceptors with Ins 1,4,5-P3 in the presence of the non-specific phosphatase inhibitors, vanadate and fluoride, which prolong the response to a flash of light in ventral photoreceptors (D.W. Corson, A. Fein, W.W. Walthall, J. Gen. Physiol. 82 (1983) 659-677). In the presence of fluoride or vanadate the response to Ins 1,4,5-P3 was composed of a burst of waves rather than a single wave of depolarization. We conclude that hydrolysis of Ins 1,4,5-P3 by the InsP3-5-phosphatase plays a role in terminating the ventral photoreceptors response to Ins 1,4,5-P3 and also to light.",Excluded
4088,"Radiation Safety Considerations in GliaSite <sup>125</sup>I Brain Implant Procedures The traditional approach to treatment of certain malignant brain tumors involves permanent implantation of <sup>125</sup>I seeds sequential to tumor's resection. This approach has recently been changed for patients with unifocal recurrent gliomas. What began during the 1990's as a large clinical trial utilizing GliaSite Radiotherapy System, is currently becoming standard of care. This radiotherapy system consists of an inflatable balloon catheter, 2, 3, or 4 cm diameter, which is surgically placed in the tumor resection cavity; its positioning and the level of conformity within the cavity are verified via MRI imaging with contrast. The balloon is then filled with appropriate volume of <sup>125</sup>I in the liquid form. Radiation treatment prescription dose ranges from 40 to 60 Gy (4,000 to 6,000 rads). This is accomplished by allowing 2.77 to 16.6 GBq (75 to 450 mCi) of <sup>125</sup>I to remain in the balloon for 3-5 d. Numerous technical, dosimetric, and logistical considerations arise when handling large quantities of iodine necessary to perform GliaSite procedures. They require coordination of efforts of several hospital departments and the institution's RSO-in our case, two RSOs, at the University of Colorado Hospital and University of Colorado Health Sciences Center hold separate radioactive materials licenses. Based on our experiences and those of others, we conclude that, with appropriate guidance and care, these procedures can be performed safely without excessive restrictions.",Excluded
3828,"3D cerebral angiography: radiation dose comparison with digital subtraction angiography BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As the use of 3D rotational angiography (3D RA) for the evaluation of cerebral vasculature becomes more widespread, it is important to evaluate this imaging method's effect on patient radiation dose. The purpose of the study is to measure 3D RA radiation dose as compared with biplanar digital subtraction angiography (DSA). METHOD(S): The distribution and peak skin dose were measured for 3D RA and biplanar DSA by using an anthropomorphic skull phantom. In addition, the cumulative incident dose, summed over all images in each acquisition, was determined. Measurements were acquired for our facility's standard 3D RA acquisition mode (25 degrees /s rotational speed; 162 total frames) and other available acquisition mode selections. RESULT(S): For 3D RA, the skin dose was found to be distributed across the back and sides of the skull with the peak skin dose located at the center of the back of the skull. The peak skin dose for the standard 3D RA acquisition mode was 15 mGy. For a biplanar DSA run, the peak skin dose was 58 mGy, also located at the back of the skull. The cumulative incident dose for the standard 3D RA acquisition mode was 33 mGy, compared with 53 mGy for biplanar DSA. CONCLUSION(S): The patient radiation dose for 3D RA is significantly lower than for biplanar DSA, by nearly a factor of 4 in peak skin dose and 40% lower in cumulative incident dose.",Excluded
4683,"Space cycle: a human-powered centrifuge that can be used for hypergravity resistance training INTRODUCTION: This study represents the first step toward testing the hypothesis that hypergravity can be used as a unique resistance training modality for maintaining the health and function of skeletal muscle in microgravity. The primary objectives of this study were to use a human-powered short-arm centrifuge for the following: 1) to determine whether subjects could perform squats under hypergravity conditions without developing motion sickness or illusory motion; 2) to measure foot forces while performing squats under hypergravity conditions; and 3) to determine the mechanical power required to produce 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 Gz (head to foot) at the feet.METHODS: Subjects (22 males and 19 females) performed 10 squats each at 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 Gz on a human-powered short-arm centrifuge, the space cycle. Foot forces during each squat were monitored using insole force sensors, and normalized to foot forces measured at 1 Gz (relative foot forces).RESULTS: Illusory motion was minimized using a visual focal point, and did not affect the ability of subjects to perform squats. The mean standing relative foot forces at 3.0 Gz were 2.3 and 2.4 for the male and female subjects, respectively. The work rate required to power the space cycle was a linear function of Gz, and is well within the aerobic scope of untrained individuals.DISCUSSION: The findings of this study demonstrate that hypergravity can be used as an effective modality for loading skeletal muscle and that subjects can perform squat resistance exercise without developing motion sickness or illusory motion.",Excluded
3866,"Palmitoylation is a prerequisite for dimerization-dependent raftophilicity of rhodopsin The visual photopigment rhodopsin (Rh) is a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) responsible for initiation of the phototransduction cascade in rod photoreceptors. Similar to other GPCRs, Rh can form dimers or even higher oligomers and tends to have a supramolecular organization that is likely important in the dim light response. Rh also exhibits high affinity for lipid rafts (i.e. raftophilicity) upon light-dependent binding with the cognate G protein transducin (G<sub>t</sub>), suggesting the presence of lipid raft-like domains in the retinal disk membrane and their importance in phototransduction. However, the relationship between Rh oligomerization and lipid rafts in the disk membrane remains to be explored. Given previous findings that G<sub>t</sub> binds to dimeric Rh and that Rh is posttranslationally modified with two highly raftophilic palmitoyl moieties, we hypothesized that Rh becomes raftophilic upon dimerization. Here, using biochemical assays, we found that Rh*-G<sub>t</sub> complexes in the detergent-resistant membrane are partially resistant to cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and that the Rh-to-G<sub>t</sub> stoichiometry in this methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-resistant complex is 2:1. Next, we found that IgG-mediated Rh-Rh cross-linking renders Rh highly raftophilic, supporting the premise that Rh becomes raftophilic upon dimerization. Rh depalmitoylation via reduction of thioester linkages blocked the translocation of IgG-cross-linked Rh to the detergent-resistant membrane, highlighting that the two palmitoyl moieties are important for the dimerization-dependent raftophilicity of Rh. These results indicate that palmitoylated GPCRs such as Rh can acquire raftophilicity upon G protein-stabilized dimerization and thereby organize receptor-cluster rafts by recruiting raftophilic lipids.",Excluded

Seeds were counted on radiographs from CT simulation, first treatment and last treatment. Retention and use of at least three markers for kV/kV matching was considered a successful implant. A visual analogue scale (VAS) pain assessment was performed. SAS was used for data analysis.RESULTS: Fiducial marker placement was successful for kV/kV matching in 556/581 patients (95.7%). The procedure was aborted due to pain in two patients. Additional sedation during the procedure was required in two patients. Complications include urinary infections (2 patients, <0.5%) and transient haematuria (2 patients, <0.5%). There were no recorded calls requesting additional pain medication or delays in radiation due to complications. The number of seeds identified at simulation: 4 (2 patients), 3 (554 patients), 2 (21 patients), 1 (1 patient), 0 (1 patient). One patient with three seeds and two patients with <2 seeds had cone beam CT instead of kV/kV imaging for image guidance. No seeds were lost after simulation. The mean visual analogue pain score associated with transperineal gold seed insertion met patients' expectations (respectively 4.1 vs. 4.4 P = 0.19).CONCLUSION: Outpatient transperineal insertion of fiducials avoids the rectum, is effective, convenient, well tolerated and has few side effects.",Excluded
4835,"Cortical activation with deep brain stimulation of the anterior thalamus for epilepsy OBJECTIVE: We studied the relation between thalamic stimulation parameters and the morphology, topographic distribution and cortical sources of the cerebral responses in patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus.METHODS: Bipolar and monopolar stimuli were delivered at a rate of 2 Hz to the anterior (AN, four patients), the dorsomedian (DM, four patients), and the centromedian nucleus (CM, one patient) using the programmable stimulation device (Medtronic ITREL II). Source modeling was carried out by using statistical non-parametric mapping of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) values.RESULTS: All patients demonstrated reproducible time-locked cortical responses (CRs) consisting of a sequence of components with latencies between 20 and 320 ms. The morphology of these CRs, however, was very heterogeneous, depending primarily on the site of stimulation. Following AN stimulation, cortical activation was most prominent in ipsilateral cingulate gyrus, insular cortex and lateral neocortical temporal structures. Stimulation of the DM mainly showed activation of the ipsilateral orbitofrontal and mesial and lateral frontal areas, but also involvement of mesial temporal structures. Stimulation of the CM showed a rather diffuse (though still mainly ipsilateral) increase of cortical activity. The magnitude of cortical activation was positively related to the strength of the stimulus and inversely related to the impedance of the electrode.CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of cortical activation corresponded with the hodology of the involved structures and may underscore the importance of optimal localization of DBS electrodes in patients with epilepsy.SIGNIFICANCE: The method of analyzing sources of CRs could potentially be a useful tool for titration of DBS parameters in patients with electrode contacts in clinically silent areas. Furthermore, the inverse relation of the cortical activation and the impedance of the electrode contacts might suggest that these impedance measurements should be taken into consideration when adjusting DBS parameters in patients with epilepsy.",Excluded

Electroencephalography revealed frequent spikes in the left temporal lobe. In response to clonazepam, but not antipsychotics, her auditory hallucinations almost completely disappeared and spikes were reduced. Her auditory hallucinations exhibited the characteristics of first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia, however, the content of experiential auditory hallucinations endured by our patient suggested an epileptic origin. We believe that the persistent subictal discharges, in combination with hyperexcitability of the temporal neocortex near radiation-induced necrotic lesions, were the cause of the auditory hallucinations.",Excluded

However, RT is associated with significant life long morbidity. We assessed the e fficacy of a two-drug induction regimen, followed by transoral robotic assisted surgery (TORS) & neck dissection for locally advanced OPSCC. Method(s): This is an IRB approved single-arm phase II study for untreated stage III or IVA OPSCC patients (pts) with an ECOG < 2 and GFR > 50 cc. Induction chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and taxotere 75 mg/m2 every 21 days for 3 cycles. Tumor shrinkage was examined after each cycle. If the primary tumor was > 80% smaller, pts underwent TORS and neck dissection(s). At post-op visits, flexible laryngoscopy, blood work, and imaging with PET/CT and/or MRI were done. Short and long term toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated. Result(s): Nineteenpts were treated and 14 are available for analysis. Thirteen were male, 12 were Caucasian, 2 were African-American, and 13 were HPV+. Median age at diagnosis was 57. Tumors involved the tonsil (11 pts) and base of tongue (3 pts). Three pts were stage III, and 11 were stage IVA. Tumor size was reduced on average by 58%, 84% and 92% after the 1st, 2 and 3 induction cycles respectively. Pathologic complete remission of primary disease occurred in 11 pts and in 7 pts with cervical lymph node disease. Four pts were given dose-reduced chemo and one pt was changed to carboplatin per protocol because of renal dysfunction. In addition, adverse events included three patients with grade I fatigue, neuropathy or nausea. Pre vs post tx QOL scores were not significantly different. At a mean follow-up (f/u) of 13 months (range 2.5 to 19.7), 13 pts are alive and well. Three pts recurred, and were treated with salvage CRT. One pt died of metastatic disease. Conclusion(s): Cisplatin + Taxotere is an effective induction tx for OPSCC, Induction tx followed by transoral & neck resections without RT is a promising tx model for OPSCC. It appears effective while avoiding adverse effects of RT. Longer f/u is required to assess its true e fficacy.",Excluded

Radiation-induced ototoxicity has been demonstrated to be linked to the increased production of ROS and MAPK. We intended to investigate the effect of p38 inhibition on radiation-induced ototoxicity in cochlea-derived HEI-OC1 cells and in a zebrafish model. The otoprotective effect of p38 inhibition against radiation was tested in vitro in the organ of Corti-derived cell line, HEI-OC1, and in vivo in a zebrafish model. Radiation-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and an increase of intracellular NO generation were demonstrated in HEI-OC1 cells. The p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580, ameliorated radiation-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial injury in HEI-OC1 cells. p38 inhibition reduced radiation-induced activation of JNK, p38, cytochrome c, and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in HEI-OC1 cells. Scanning electron micrography showed that SB203580 prevented radiation-induced destruction of kinocilium and stereocilia in zebrafish neuromasts. The results of this study suggest that p38 plays an important role in mediating radiation-induced ototoxicity and inhibition of p38 could be a plausible option for preventing radiation ototoxicity.",Included

Primary blast exposure without secondary injuries or clinical symptoms at the time has not been studied. Objective(s): Residual effects on neuroimaging metrics of exposure to primary blast insufficient to meet criteria formild TBI were assessed. Method(s): Post-deployment veterans without mTBI, with (n=20) and without (n=18) primary blast exposure were assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). WM-specific registration followed by whole-brain voxel-wise analysis of fractional anisotropic (FA) diffusion was conducted in all subjects.

The aims of this study were to evaluate [(11)C]MeS-IMPY uptake in nonhuman primate brain and to estimate radiation exposure from serial whole-body images. Eight PET studies were performed in rhesus monkeys to measure the brain uptake and washout of [(11)C]MeS-IMPY. Time-activity data were analyzed with one-tissue and two-tissue compartmental models using radiometabolite-corrected plasma input function. In addition, two whole-body PET scans were acquired for 120 min to determine the biodistribution of [(11)C]MeS-IMPY. Tomographic PET images were compressed into a single planar image to identify organs with the highest radiation exposures. Estimates of the absorbed dose of radiation were calculated using OLINDA 1.0. Injection of [(11)C]MeS-IMPY caused little change in pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and temperature. [(11)C]MeS-IMPY showed high standardized brain uptake values of approximately 500% and 600% between 2 and 3 min in cortical regions and the cerebellum, respectively. The brain uptake of [(11)C]MeS-IMPY was widespread and quite uniform across all cortical regions. Activity rapidly washed out of the brain, with 20% of peak activity remaining at 40 min. Thus, all brain regions showed minimal retention of radioactivity, consistent with these healthy young animals having negligible amyloid plaques. Regional brain activity fitted well into a one-tissue compartment model. The average volume of distribution in all brain regions was 7.66+/-2.14 ml/cm(3) (n=4). The organs with the highest radiation exposure (muSv/MBq) were the gallbladder wall (33.4), urinary bladder (17) and lungs (12.9), with a resulting effective dose of 4.9 microSv/MBq (18 mrem/mCi).

3732,"An unusual natural history of metastatic basal cell carcinoma Introduction: Basal Cell carcinoma (BCC), unlike other skin malignancies, rarely metastasizes with an incidence rate ranging between 0.0028 and 0.55%. Less than 400 cases have been reported in the literature over the past 120 years.We present a rare case of BCC that had recurrent metastasis in the lung over a period of 17 years. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is an 89 year old male with a history of BCC of the forehead resected 17 years ago. Eight years later, he presented with solitary pulmonary nodule confirmed to be metastatic BCC. He underwent wedge resection of the right lower lobe followed by radiation due to local recurrence. He now presented with numbness of the right hand worsened by deep inspiration. The patient denied fever, cough, sputum production, hemoptysis, chest pain or shortness of breath. His other medical history included hypertension and COPD.Chest Xray showed right middle lobe infiltrate and elevated hemi diaphragm. CT scan of the chest without contrast demonstrated, right middle lobe pneumonia and a 2.5cm nodule in the left apex. He was treated with antibiotics and a subsequent CT chest with contrast confirmed only a spiculated mass in the left apex. CT scan of the abdomen, pelvis and brain was unremarkable.PET-CT scan showed a hypermetabolic 2.3cm apical nodule with irregular border and SUV of 12.6, suspicious for a primary lung neoplasm. He had a CT guided biopsy and frozen section demonstrated malignant cells. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the lesion to be a metastatic BCC, morphologically similar to the primary BCC diagnosed 17 years. DISCUSSION: BCC is usually a slow growing, locally destructive lesion with excellent prognosis. On the other hand, metastatic BCC is very aggressive and carries a poor prognosis. The median time for metastasis from onset of initial lesion is about 9 years.The size of the initial tumor and local recurrence appear to predict the likelihood of metastatic disease.The metastasis can be either regional (RM) or distant (DM). Lung is a common site for distant metastasis .The median survival with DM is 24 months in comparison to 87 months with RM. This particular patient however survived for more than 8 years since his metastatic disease was first diagnosed. Conclusion(s): Metastatic BCC is a rare entity. Although historically associated with a poor prognosis, the natural history of metastatic BCC might not be as grim as reported in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the longest surviving patient with metastatic BCC ever reported. More research is necessary to better characterize favorable factors in metastatic BCC and find out the sub-group of patients who would greatly benefit from aggressive therapy.",Excluded

Higher BMI is known to complicate the acquisition of radiographic images. Therefore it can be hypothesized that the patient's body habitus can influence the delivery of a spinal injection.OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of patient BMI on the length of fluoroscopy and procedure times during spine interventions.DESIGN: Secondary analysis of 2 prospective observational studies.SETTING: All injections were performed in an outpatient university setting.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 209 patients in whom spine injections were performed (99 women), with a mean age of 54.6 years.METHODS: The fluoroscopy times for 202 participants and total procedure times for 137 participants were recorded. Additional participant characteristics, including age, gender, BMI, and actual procedures performed, also were collected. Analysis of covariance and linear and nonlinear model analysis were performed to assess the effect of BMI on fluoroscopy and procedure times.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Fluoroscopy time and procedure duration times.RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 54.6 years, 51% were men, and 77% (n = 155) were overweight (BMI >=25). Participants received the following interventions: 40 zygapophyseal joint injections, 33 medial branch nerve blocks, 113 transforaminal epidural injections, and 16 combined zygapophyseal joint injections and epidural injections. Gender, procedure number, and procedure type did not differ between groups. The overweight group demonstrated a 30% increase in mean fluoroscopy time and a 35% increase in mean procedure time. Controlling for other variables, we found that differences in fluoroscopy time and procedure time were significant (P = .032 and P = .031, respectively) between the 2 groups.CONCLUSIONS: Significantly prolonged procedure time and fluoroscopy time in overweight patients increase the risks associated with spine interventions, not only to the patients but also to the operating room staff exposed to ionizing radiation.",Excluded

As conventional MR imaging does not delineate the optic radiation, the risk to vision from surgery cannot be predicted, nor can surgery be tailored to minimise the risk. Methods Conventional structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging were acquired in 13 patients with medically refractory epilepsy due a lesion near the optic radiation and undergoing pre-surgical evaluation at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. The optic radiation was delineated and visualised in relation to the lesions on anatomical images and in 3D reconstructions. Pre- and post-operative visual fields were acquired by Goldmann perimetry. Results The relationship between the epileptogenic lesion and the optic radiation was demonstrated in each patient provididing helpful additional information in deciding whether to proceed with surgery, and in planning the surgical procedure and approach. Prseoperative and postoperative imaging findings correlated with the visual field data. Conclusion The optic radiation shows significant anatomical variability, but can be reliably delineated by tractography. As surgical disruption of the optic radiation has serious consequences for the patient, DTI tractography proves a useful technique in this population. Future integration with real-time neuronavigation will inimise the risks of neurosurgery.",Excluded
4033,"LINAC radiosurgery: an animal model Fifteen cats were irradiated with an animal LINAC (linear accelerator) radiosurgery device. After 6 months, they were studied with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, gross pathology after Evans blue perfusion, and histopathology. The lesion size was relatively constant in the cats receiving a dose of 7500, 10,000, 12,500, or 15,000 cGy to the 84% isodose line of a 1-cm collimator. The composition of the lesion correlated with dose: the lower-dose lesions were found histologically to contain areas of edema, demyelination, reactive gliosis, and vascular proliferation; the higher-dose lesions contained increasing amounts of hemorrhage and coagulative necrosis. The borders of the lesions were sharply demarcated from surrounding normal brain. Gadolinium-enhanced MR studies correlated well with areas of blood-brain barrier breakdown, as confirmed by areas of Evans blue staining. This model could serve as the basis for further studies of the biological effects of LINAC radiosurgery.",Included
4383,"A puzzling case of presumed severe post-radiation pelvic myositis Background: A fit and well 56 year old woman under the care of Rheumatology with quiescent systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a past medical history of anal SCC 8 years ago, treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She presented in April 2016 with sudden onset severe pelvic pain and stiffness, which within days rendered her immobile. The symptoms had been preceded by mild flu like illness. Clinically she had no systemic features but on examination demonstrated significant bilateral pelvic girdle weakness and pain. There was no distal neurological deficit and no clinical findings suggesting an SLE flare. Working diagnosis was of myositis, possibly secondary to SLE. Method(s): Serology showed an acute phase response (CRP 298), normal CK, complement levels, ANA and dsDNA. Renal function was normal and there was no evidence of lupus nephritis. Within a week of admission she underwent a pelvic MRI (with STIR), which showed florid inflammation within the muscles of her pelvis. When compared to the map of her radiotherapy treatment, the area almost exactly matched. This changed her working diagnosis to include delayed onset radiotherapy-induced myositis. Result(s): Her inflammatory markers remained markedly elevated (CRP >250). She was due to start high dose steroids for treatment of myositis to cover any potential inflammatory component, in the knowledge that evidence for steroid use and success in radiation induced myositis was sparse and had modest success at best. Incidentally she was found to have intermittent genito-urinary symptoms over the preceding 4-5 months, including dyspareunia and intermittent purulent discharge. She had no other signs to suggest sepsis and observations were all normal. A high vaginal swab grew Group G streptococcus, which, following extensive gynaecology review investigation was subsequently found to be due to a small abscess inside the vagina. It was not amenable to surgical drainage and was treated conservatively with antibiotics. Within 2 weeks of antibiotics therapy, analgesia and physiotherapy for her reduced mobility, her inflammatory markers improved and her pain started to improve. She underwent an open muscle biopsy under GA which was inconclusive. Antibiotics were continued and after 3 weeks of inpatient IV treatment her inflammatory markers showed a dramatic improvement. Her pain gradually improved along with it, as did her mobility. Conclusion(s): She was discharged from hospital with a prolonged course of antibiotics and continues to make great progress. Steroids treatment is still on hold until infection cleared and recovery of function established. It remains to be seen if indeed the area of inflammation actually represents anything other than infection induced myositis.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE To report the methods and results of palladium-103 brachytherapy for American Joint Committee on Cancer, 7th edition, T3- and T4-sized choroidal melanomas. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective analysis of the results of a clinical case series over a 10-year period of 47 consecutive patients with uveal melanoma. The patients were treated at The New York Eye Cancer Center, Beth Israel Comprehensive Cancer Center, or The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary between 2002 and 2012 and had a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Tumors had a mean preoperative apical tumor height of 8.6mmand a mean largest basal diameter of 15.8 mm. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We analyzed, but were not limited to, data on the methods of radiation therapy, local tumor control, adverse effects, vision retention, and metastatic rate. RESULTS All patients completed therapy and received the prescribed tumor apex dose. At a median of 47 months (range, 6-125 months), the rate of local control was 91% and the rate of eye retention was 89%. The most common long-term brachytherapy-related complication was radiation maculopathy (66%of patients), followed by radiation optic neuropathy (51%of patients). One or both of these complications were diagnosed at a mean time of 16 months (range, 2-36 months) after brachytherapy. Secondary cataract developed in 36%of patients. Glaucoma developed in 17%of patients and resulted in enucleation in 4%of patients. The mean pretreatment visual acuity was 20/50 (range, 20/12.5 to hand motions), which evolved to a mean visual acuity of 20/100 (range, 20/20 to no light perception). Overall, 25 of 47 patients (53%) maintained 20/200 or better vision. Metastatic melanoma developed in 32% of patients.

4107,"Stress response of a p53 homologue in the radioresistant Sf9 insect cells PURPOSE: To investigate homology and stress response of p53 (a 53 kDa tumor suppressor protein) orthologue in Sf9 Lepidopteran insect cell line that exhibits very high radioresistance.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Western immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, degenerate RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay, flow cytometry and immuno-fluorescence microscopy were used for characterizing structural and functional features of Sfp53 (Spodoptera frugiperda p53) in gamma-irradiated or etoposide-treated Sf9 insect and BMG-1 (brain malignant glioma) human cells. Cells were pre-treated with caffeine for inhibiting ATM/ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein/ATM and Rad-3-related protein) activation, wherever required.RESULTS: A 47-49 kDa protein band was observed with antibodies against three different epitopes, demonstrating conservation of respective domains in Sfp53. Immunoprecipitation also yielded similar-sized protein. Degenerate RT-PCR resulted in product of same size in both cell lines. Similar gel mobility shift of p53-binding oligonucleotide with BMG-1 and Sf9 cell lysates indicated analogous transcriptional activity of Sfp53. Constitutive Sfp53 level was higher than hp53 (human p53) and showed primarily cytoplasmic localization. Radiation-induced accumulation was considerably less in Sf9 even as an analogous ATM/ATR-dependent nuclear translocation was observed following gamma-irradiation and etoposide.CONCLUSIONS: A smaller-sized Sfp53 orthologue shows highly conserved native structure with DNA-binding, N-terminus and C-terminus domains, and has analogous p53 transcriptional activity. While its nuclear translocation and ATM/ATR dependence were similar to hp53, the cytoplasmic localization and subdued accumulation following gamma-irradiation indicate functional differences from human cells.",Included
3659,"Effects of escitalopram challenge on white matter integrity in obsessive-compulsive disorder and healthy controls Background: Involvement of the serotonergic system in OCD is well-known, with OCD responding to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Chronic use of SSRIs changes brain connectivity in OCD, and a single dose of an SSRI dramatically alters functional connectivity throughout the brain in healthy subjects. The question is raised whether acute administration of an SSRI can also significantly alter white matter integrity in the brain of patients with OCD. Method(s): OCD patients (n=20) and matched healthy controls (n=24) received a single dose of escitalopram 20mg on one day, and a single dose of placebo on another day, in randomized order, under double-blind conditions. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to compare white matter integrity of the whole brain between the groups. The impact of the SSRI challenge on white matter in these two study groups were subsequently investigated, controlling for age. Result(s): There were no significant interaction effects (diagnostic group x pharmacological challenge) or effects in the OCD group separately. In controls, the escitalopram challenge had a significant impact on white matter diffusivity of the left post thalamic radiation (PTR-L) (F=7.84; p=0.01), the superior corona radiata bilaterally (SCR: F=7.99; p=0.01) and the sagittal stratum bilaterally (SS: F=6.64; p=0.02). In these tracts, FA was significantly higher and RD significantly lower after the pharmacological challenge compared to placebo. Discussion(s): Acute administration of an SSRI did not significantly alter white matter integrity in the brain of OCD patients. It did however improve white matter integrity in tracts that connect regions that may be affected in OCD, in controls. DTI-derived parameters are differently affected in OCD and healthy controls, respectively, in structures within the fronto-striatothalamo-cortical loop after chronic SSRI treatment. Alteration of white matter integrity may occur in OCD with longer treatment duration or at a different dosage with plasticity potentially playing a role.",Excluded
4707,"Comparison of radiosensitizing effects of several PARP inhibitors under clinical investigation Targeting tumor DNA repair is an attractive strategy in selectively killing tumors while sparing normal tissues. Inhibiting Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in cancers with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations has been shown to be a promising approach either as a single agent or in combination therapy with chemotherapeutics or ionizing radiation. To systematically compare the radiosensitizing efficacy of various PARP inhibitors we have evaluated the long-term cytotoxicity of ABT-888, AZD2281, MK4827, and BSI-201 in clonogenic survival assays in combination with ionizing radiation. For these studies we used the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB 231 BR, a subline of MDA-MB-231 selected for its tendency to metastasize to brain (BRCA1+/-) and MX-1 (BRCA1 deletion and BRCA2 mutation). Furthermore, we have evaluated PARP inhibitors under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (21% O2 versus 0.1% O2). In MDA-MB 231 BR cells, at a clinically relevant and achievable concentration for ABT-888 (J Clin Oncol. 2009; 27(16)) and AZD2281(N Engl J Med. 2009; 361(2)), and at 1 uM MK4827 showed radiosensitizing effects under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. BSI-201 at a clinically achievable concentration (ASCO 2010, Abstract 2012) did not exhibit radiosensitizing effects under the same conditions. When MX-1 cells were treated with BSI-201 under hypoxic conditions (0.1% O2) the cytotoxicity of BSI-201 was evident. Taken together, the results show that ABT-888, AZD2281 and MK4827 show promising radiosensitizing effects under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions whereas the cytotoxicity of BSI-201 was observed only under hypoxic conditions in BRCA1/2 mutant carrier MX-1cells.",Excluded

In a mouse model, tumor and critical organ-absorbed doses delivered by different radioimmunoconjugates were calculated and compared. We used a Medical Internal Radiation Dosimetry (MIRD)-style mouse dosimetry model that incorporates cross-organ beta doses to make refined estimates of the radiation absorbed dose to tissues. Biodistribution data from neuroblastoma xenografted nude mice were used to estimate tumor, organ and bone marrow absorbed dose values for 90Y-3F8, 131I-3F8 and 131I-F(ab')2 fragments. Immunoreactive fractions of the radiolabeled antibodies were comparable. Although tumor uptake of the radioiodinated and radiometal labeled 3F8 was much higher than that of the radioiodinated F(ab')2 fragments (maximum percent injected dose per gram values were 39.4, 33.2 and 20.1 for 131I-3F8, 90Y-3F8 and 131I-F(ab')2, respectively), tumor to nontumor ratios were higher for radioiodinated fragments (with the exception of tumor to kidney ratio). For the minimum tumor dose necessary for complete ablation, the bone marrow received 195, 278 and 401 cGy for 131I-F(ab')2, 131I-3F8 and 90Y-3F8, respectively. Tumor doses were 50.1, 232 and 992 cGy/MBq for 131I-F(ab')2, 131I-3F8 and 90Y-3F8, respectively. Tumor to bone marrow dose, which is defined as the therapeutic index, was 21.5, 14.7 and 10.4 for 131I-F(ab')2, 131I-3F8 and 90Y-3F8. 131I-F(ab')2 fragments produced the highest therapeutic index but also the lowest tumor dose for radioimmunotherapy.

4713,"Roles of DNA-dependent protein kinase and ATM in cell-cycle-dependent radiation sensitivity in human cells PURPOSE: The roles of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and ATM in the cell-cycle-dependent radiosensitivity in human cells were investigated.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A DNA-PK activity-deficient human glioblastoma cell line M059J, ataxia telangiectasia cell lines AT3BISV and AT5BIVA, and control cell lines were used. Wortmannin inhibited DNA-PK and ATM activities. Cells were synchronized by hydroxyurea. Progression through the cell cycle was analysed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: M059J exhibited hyper-radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle, with extreme hyper-radiosensitivity in G to early S-phase compared with the control cell line M059K. AT3BISV and AT5BIVA exhibited hyper-radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle but showed a similar pattern of cell-cycle-dependent radiosensitivity to that observed in LM217 or HeLa cells. In AT3BISV and AT5BIVA, radiosensitization by wortmannin was observed throughout the cell cycle and was most prominent in G1 to early S-phase. Wortmannin did not sensitize M059J to ionizing radiation in any cell-cycle phase. DNA-PK activities were not different throughout the cell cycle.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that (1) non-homologous endjoining plays a dominant role in G1 to early S-phase and a minor role in late S to G2-phase in repairing DNA double-strand breaks, (2) the role of ATM in repairing double-strand breaks may be almost cell-cycle-independent and (3) the dominant role of non-homologous end-joining during G1 to early S-phase is not due to cell-cycle-dependent fluctuations in DNA-PK activity.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of three different methods of neurologically intact TLF treatment: OPSF, minimally invasive two-plane conventional fluoroscopy-guided (FPPSF) and navigation-guided (N-PPSF). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 137 patients underwent either OPSF (n = 50) or F-PPSF (n = 39) or N-PPSF (n = 48) for stabilization of TLF between 2014 and 2016 in two Departments (Orthopaedics and Neurosurgery). Radiographs were obtained before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the final follow-up for assessment of the restoration of the spinal column. For radiologic parameters, Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle, and vertebral body compression ratio were evaluated on lateral thoracolumbar radiographs. As a method of clinical evaluation, the intraoperative blood loss, operation time, radiation dose, postoperative hospital stay, the postoperative scar size and perioprative complications. Result(s): There were significant differences between open and both percutaneous methods of treatment in surgical blood loss and postoperative hospital stay in favour of percutaneous and without significant difference between F-PPSF and N-PPSF. The time of the surgery was the shortest in OPSF and F-PPSF. The radiation dose was both the highest for the patient and the lowest for the operative team in N-PPSF. The length of the postoperative scar was equal for all groups. There were five infections of the operative wound and one implant loosening in OPSF group without any significant complication. Postoperative VAS decreased significantly in all groups and there was a significant difference in favour of percutaneous techniques groups at the time of discharge and after 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months postoperatively. There were no statistical differences in VAS. For both F-PPSF and N-PPSF ODI was significantly better 6 weeks after the surgery than for OPSF without any difference between all groups at the final follow-up. The regional sagittal Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle and anterior height of the fractured vertebra all significantly improved in each group immediately after the surgery and at the final follow-up. Conclusion(s): Both percutaneous pedicle screw fixation techniques were comparable except the radiation dose for the operative team, which was the lowest in N-PPSF group. Although all three groups showed favorable outcomes at the final follow-up, F-PPSF and N-PPSF provided earlier pain relief, better functional improvement, less perioperative complications but worse early postoperative radiological outcome in comparison with OPSF.",Excluded

RF exposure for 24 h at a specific absorption rate (SAR) of 10 W/kg was carried out in a waveguide system under accurately controlled environmental and dosimetric parameters. DNA integrity, cell viability, and apoptosis were investigated as cellular endpoints relevant for carcinogenesis and other diseases of the central nervous system. Very sensitive biological assays were employed to assess the effects immediately after RF exposure and 24 h later, as demonstrated by the cellular response elicited in PC12 cells using positive control treatments provided for each assay. In our experimental conditions, 24 h of RF exposure at a carrier frequency and modulation scheme typical of a UMTS signal was not able to elicit any effect in the selected cellular endpoints in undifferentiated PC12 cells, despite the application of a higher SAR value than those applied in the majority of the studies reported in the literature.",Excluded

CT scanners have the potential to deliver low radiation dose by utilising tube potential and tube current modulation techniques. We aim to determine the application of CARE kV (kV modulation) and CARE Dose4D (mAs modulation) in CT scan of brain. Both CARE kV and CARE Dose4D are wellestablished innovative technology of Siemens. Method(s): A prospective study was conducted from April to August 2015 at TUTH. Data were collected on a Siemens 128 slices CT scanner. Non-random purposive sampling was employed.

PDE6gamma overexpression decreases the rate of rise of the rod response at dim intensities, indicating a reduction in the gain of transduction that may be the result of cytoplasmic PDE6gamma binding to activated transducin alpha GTP (Talpha-GTP) before the Talpha-GTP binds to endogenous PDE6gamma. Excess PDE6gamma also produces a marked acceleration in the falling phase of the light response and more rapid recovery of sensitivity and circulating current after prolonged light exposure. These effects are not mediated by accelerating GTP hydrolysis through the GAP (GTPase activating protein) complex, because the decay of the light response is also accelerated in rods that overexpress PDE6gamma but lack RGS9. Our results show that the PDE6gamma binding sites of PDE6 alpha and beta are accessible to excess (presumably cytoplasmic) PDE6gamma in the light, once endogenous PDE6gamma has been displaced from its binding site by Talpha-GTP. They also suggest that in the presence of Talpha-GTP, the PDE6gamma remains attached to the rest of the PDE6 molecule, but after conversion of Talpha-GTP to Talpha-GDP, the PDE6gamma may dissociate from the PDE6 and exchange with a cytoplasmic pool. This pool may exist even in wild-type rods and may explain the decay of rod photoresponses in the presence of nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP.",Excluded

3888,"A novel LITT treatment planning system to optimize laser ablation delivery to brain targets Purpose: Laser interstitial thermal therapy, or LITT, is a minimally invasive stereotactic tumor ablative technique. One application is treating intracranial targets. LITT systems use a laser energy probe that can be inserted into the patient, emitting near infrared laser radiation that induces necrosis in clinical targets while providing thermal damage updates via MR thermometry. The rigid laser probes range two and three mm in diameter, through which the thermal energy efficiently emits along straight-line pathways. The systems allow for varying dwell times and rates of energy deposition to assist in the ability to maximize the thermal damage to the target tissues while minimizing the damage to normal tissues. For targets that cannot be treated along a linear trajectory, multiple trajectories are necessary. However, planning systems, like those available in ionizing radiation delivery, are all but absent from the clinical setting. The goals of this project aim to provide a planning system to allow the optimization of the laser trajectory. Method(s): Twelve patients who underwent LITT therapy using traditional approaches, where the surgeon decided on laser trajectory by inspection of orthogonal radiology images were post procedure planned using a rudimentary system of LITT planning. Starting with a stereotactic planning system, a thermal dose kernel was developed. This effort has provided a rudimentary tool that yields first estimates for optimized LITT. Result(s): A conformal index was developed and evaluated for each planning technique. The average index for the simple inspection of orthogonal images based on thermal dose threshold lines was 88.4% while the conformal index of the planning system were 46.2%. Conclusion(s): As with ionizing radiation, it is anticipated that this increase in thermal optimization will translate into better tumor control and lower complications. A system, with a more precise thermal predictive algorithm and automated trajectory planning is being pursued.",Excluded
4702,"Effects of serotonergic agonists on firing rates of photically responsive cells in the hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus Serotonergic neurons from the midbrain raphe nuclei innervate the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which functions as the dominant pacemaker for mammalian circadian rhythms. We investigated the effects of serotonin (5-HT) on firing rates of light-activated SCN cells in urethane-anesthetized hamsters. Micro-iontophoretic application of 5-HT or 5-HT1A agonists (8-OH-DPAT and 5-CT) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of spontaneous activity and photic responses in the majority of SCN cells tested. Application of metergoline alone, a non-selective 5-HT antagonist, slightly increased firing rates during darkness and light exposure, suggesting a tonic serotonergic suppression of SCN activity. Metergoline also effectively attenuated suppression induced by the three 5-HT agonists. In addition, the effects of 8-OH-DPAT were blocked by a 5-HT1A antagonist, SDZ 216-525. However, other putative 5-HT antagonists were weak (propranolol and NAN-190) or ineffective (ketanserin) in blocking the action of 8-OH-DPAT. These results indicate that serotonin has a potent role in reducing photic effects on retinally activated SCN cells in hamsters, and that these effects are mediated by a receptor with properties similar to those of the 5-HT1A subtype.",Excluded

However, concerns have been raised about potential long-term side effects, including cerebrovascular events (CVEs) and secondary intracranial tumors.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the risk of CVEs, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality in irradiated (IRR) NFPA patients, compared with NFPA patients who were not irradiated (non-IRR).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The study cohort included 806 patients with a NFPA from the Dutch National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults, a nationwide long-term surveillance study in severe GH-deficient adult patients. IRR patients (n = 456) were compared with non-IRR patients (n = 350).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CVEs, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality were measured.RESULTS: Sixty-nine subjects developed a CVE. In men, but not in women, the incidence of a CVE was significantly higher in IRR patients than in non-IRR patients (hazard ratio 2.99, 95% confidence interval 1.31-6.79). A secondary intracranial tumor developed in five IRR patients and two non-IRR patients. After adjustment for age, radiotherapy was not associated with mortality.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of secondary intracranial tumors and mortality did not differ between IRR and non-IRR patients. However, a CVE was found significantly more frequently in IRR men but not in women. Further research into the long-term effects of cranial radiotherapy seems mandatory. The potential risks of radiotherapy have to be taken into account when radiotherapy is considered in NFPA patients, and long-term follow-up is recommended.",Included
4207,"Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma.METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993.

The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival.RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD.CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume.",Excluded
4194,"Spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties: implications for elevated cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure Evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and diminished in astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were isolated from 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for in vitro vascular and mechanical testing. Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were lower and vascular distensibility greater in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice (n=7) relative to ground-based control group (GC) mice (n=12). Basilar artery maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236+/-9 mum and GC: 215+/-5 mum) with no difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4+/-1.6 mum; GC: 12.2+/-1.2 mum). Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized via nanoindentation, was lower in SF mice (SF: 3.4+/-0.3 N/m; GC: 5.4+/-0.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of perfusion could contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an associated impairment of visual acuity in astronauts during spaceflight.",Included
4252,"Combining low-dose whole brain radiation with radioimmunotherapy for primary central nervous system lymphoma Purpose/Objective(s): Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive B-cell disorder that initially responds well to therapy, but a majority of patients relapse within 2 years. High-dose whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) was once the primary treatment, but eventual relapses and late neurocognitive sequelae were frequently observed. The addition of CNS-directed chemotherapy to WBRT improved duration of response, with a concomitant increase in neurocognitive problems. More recently, medical oncologists have attempted to avoid radiation altogether, with similar clinical responses as seen with WBRT alone. The addition of rituximab has yielded little improvement due to the poor efficiency (<1%) of the antibody to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). WBRT has been shown to temporarily disrupt the BBB permeability to macromolecules for several hours.We hypothesized that adjuvant low-dose WBRT followed by anti-CD20-directed radioimmunotherapy (RIT) may allow for specific dose escalation to areas of tumor cells while avoiding extra dose to uninvolved areas of the brain, decreasing the chance for significant neurocognitive deficits. Materials/Methods: Four patients (71F, 69M, 48F, 53M) with PCNSL (3 relapsed, 1 newly diagnosed) were treated with low-dose (18 Gy in 10 fractions) WBRT,with 90Yibritumomab tiuxetan RIT given immediately after the final WBRT fraction. None of the patients had previously received radiation therapy.Median RIT dosewas 24.5 (21.8-32) mCi. All patients were restaged with contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain at 3 months, and every 3 months following. At baseline and at each follow-up visit, neurocognition was tested and family members were asked about subjective changes. Result(s): All four patients obtained a complete response to chemotherapy + low-dose WBRT + RIT. After a median follow-up of 17.5 (12-20) months, no relapses have been observed. No decline in neurocognitive function (objective or subjective) has been seen; in fact, improvement was seen in 3 patients. All patients tolerated the regimen well, with the typical transient decline and recovery of blood counts seen with RIT. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant low-dose WBRT and RIT following CNS-directed chemotherapy appears to be safe in this small sample. Complete responses were seen in all patients, and this appears to be durable compared to standard PCNSL salvage therapies. No neurocognitive deficits were seen following this novel radiation therapy regimen. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.",Excluded

Report of a case Treatment of patients with osteoradionecrosis of the mandible with a pathologic fracture consists in almost all cases of a continuity resection of the mandible. This leads to functional and esthetic problems that can only be solved by often extensive surgery. In this case report we present a 38-year-old woman who developed osteoradionecrosis of the mandible with a pathologic fracture 1 1/2 years after combined surgical and radiation therapy of an adenocarcinoma of the right parotid gland. The patient had a subcondylar pathologic fracture together with osteolysis in the right mandibular body, normally an indication for partial resection of the mandible. Because of the absence of denuded bone, fistulation, and the poor quality of the surrounding soft tissues, a more conservative approach was chosen. Treatment consisted of hyperbaric oxygen and dental extractions with alveolectomy with the patient under local anesthesia. During follow-up, a second pathologic fracture occurred in the region of the right first and second molar. No additional treatment was given. Six and one-half years after the initial treatment and 5 1/2 years after the last fracture, the patient is free of complaints, the fractures have healed and both esthetic and functional results are good.",Excluded

4407,"Space, gravity and the physiology of aging: parallel or convergent disciplines? A mini-review The abnormal physiology that manifests itself in healthy humans during their adaptation to the microgravity of space has all the features of accelerated aging. The mechano-skeletal and vestibulo-neuromuscular stimuli which are below threshold in space, result in an overall greater than 10-fold more rapid onset and time course of muscle and bone atrophy in space and the development of balance and coordination problems on return to Earth than occur with aging. Similarly, the loss of functional capacity of the cardiovascular system that results in space and continuous bed rest is over 10 times faster than in the course of aging. Deconditioning in space from gravity deprivation has brought attention to the medical hazards of deconditioning on Earth from gravity withdrawal as in sedentary aging. Though seemingly reversible after periods of 6 months in space or its ground analog of bed rest, it remains to be seen whether that will be so after longer exposures. Both adaptation to space and aging do not merely parallel but converge as disorders of mechanotransduction. Like spaceflight, its analog bed rest telescopes the changes observed with aging and serves as a useful clinical model for the study of age-related deconditioning. The convergence of the disciplines of aging, along with gravitational and space physiology is advancing the understanding and prevention of modern lifestyle medical disorders.",Excluded

Method(s): A retrospective monocentric analysis including all patients who underwent single-fraction LINAC- or CyberKnife-based radiosurgery for AN between 1991 and 2015. Patient data were analyzed in terms of radiologic and clinical tumor control (no further intervention needed), treatment-related complications, preservation of serviceable hearing, and objectified hearing loss using pure tone average levels. Result(s): We included 335 patients (median age 58.2 years, treated either by LINAC-based [n = 270] or CyberKnife [n = 65] stereotactic radiosurgery). The median tumor volume was 1.1 mL (0.1-23.7 mL). The median radiation dose was 12 Gy (LINAC 12 Gy, 11-20 Gy; CyberKnife 13 Gy, 12-13 Gy) at an isodose level of 71.7% (LINAC 68.3%, 31.9%-86.2%; CyberKnife 80%, 65%-81%). The median follow-up was 30 months (LINAC 43 months, 2-224 months; CyberKnife 13 months, 4-37 months). Clinical tumor control was 98%, 89%, and 88% at 2, 5, and 10 years. The objective actuarial hearing preservation rate was 89%, 80%, and 55% at 1, 2, and 5 years. New symptoms were observed in 11.3% and classified as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 1/2, apart from 4 patients (1.2%), who developed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3. Conclusion(s): Our study shows that in AN, high tumor control and considerable hearing preservation rates can be achieved by single-dose radiosurgery at low toxicity rates, resulting in a positive impact on long-term clinical outcome.

3988,"Radiosensitivity and differentiation of ganglion cells within fetal mouse retinal explants in vitro Fetal mouse retinas were explanted at 13-14 days of gestation, and exposed to gamma radiation in vitro. Not all regions of the retina were equally susceptible to radiation-induced necrosis; when exposed to 5000 rads soon after explanation, each explant had a single small radioresistant nubbin of apparently intact tissue, located near the optic nerve-head. This region of radioresistant tissue was larger when the dose of radiation was reduced and when the explants were exposed at later times in vitro, indicating the existence of a gradient of radioresistance across retinal explants which spread outward through at least the first week in vitro, the period examined. Based upon the extensive in situ literature which has correlated the emergence of radioresistance with the differentiation of retinal neurons, we conclude that the in situ central-to-peripheral sequence of cellular differentiation continues in vitro within our retinal explants. Whereas the ganglion cell axonal outgrowth from control retinas grown in isolation on collagen substrates underwent a gradual disintegration over 3 weeks in vitro, the sparse axonal outgrowth from explants exposed to 5000 rads disintegrated abruptly at 5-7 days in vitro. This did not appear to be due to direct damage from radiation, but instead reflected the fact that axons in irradiated cultures arose from central retinal regions only, while many axons in control cultures emerged from later-differentiating peripheral regions. We suggest that disintegration of individual axons in the outgrowth may occur rapidly and in a central-to-peripheral sequence. These findings should be useful in designing assays for trophic factors which may prevent ganglion cell axon disintegration in this in vitro model system.",Excluded

4403,"Oxidative damage and repair in the developing nervous system Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a recognized cause of cell injury. In contrast to such well recognized cell injury, oxidative stress plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation and tumor promotion. This review examines the role of oxidative stress in initiating and promoting the establishment of normal or abnormal neuronal patterns and subsequent neurogenesis within the central and peripheral nervous system. In particular, the role of apoptosis in both normal and abnormal neuronal development and maturation will be examined with especial reference to the induction of apoptotic cell death following abusive ligand- induced ion movements. The interaction of oxidant stress and immediate-early response gene activation is discussed with further reference to the induction of apoptosis. While glutamate receptor activation appears mandatory for coordinate maturation and neuritogenesis, such neuronal survival and differentiation is intimately dependent upon the intracellular glutathione redox potential, maintained by cystine uptake. Selected examples of reactive oxygen species induced injury pertaining to developmental neurotoxicology are presented and include starvation, irradiation injury and glutamate excitotoxicity.",Excluded
4549,"Contribution of the Atm protein to maintaining cellular homeostasis evidenced by continuous activation of the AP-1 pathway in Atm-deficient brains Maintenance of genome stability is essential for keeping cellular homeostasis. The DNA damage response is a central component in maintaining genome integrity. Among of the most cytotoxic DNA lesions are double strand breaks (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic chemicals. ATM is missing or inactivated in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia. Ataxia-telangiectasia patients display a pleiotropic phenotype and suffer primarily from progressive ataxia caused by degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje and granule neurons. Additional features are immunodeficiency, genomic instability, radiation sensitivity, and cancer predisposition. Disruption of the mouse Atm locus creates a murine model of ataxia-telangiectasia that exhibits most of the clinical features of the human disease but very mild neuronal abnormality. The ATM protein is a multifunctional protein kinase, which serves as a master regulator of cellular responses to DSBs. There is growing evidence that ATM may be involved in addition to the DSB response in other processes that maintain processes in cellular homeostasis. For example, mounting evidence points to increased oxidative stress in the absence of ATM. Here we report that the AP-1 pathway is constantly active in the brains of Atm-deficient mice not treated with DNA damaging agents. A canonical activation (increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and c-Jun) of the AP-1 pathway was found in Atm-deficient cerebra, whereas induction of the AP-1 pathway in Atm-deficient cerebella is likely to mediate elevated expression of c-Fos and c-Jun. Although Atm(+/+) mice are capable of responding to ionizing radiation by activating stress responses such as the AP-1 pathway, Atm-deficient mice display higher basal AP-1 activity but gradually lose their ability to activate AP-1 DNA-binding activity in response to ionizing radiation. Our results further demonstrate that inactivation of the ATM gene results in a state of constant stress.",Excluded
4644,"Prolonged photoresponses in transgenic mouse rods lacking arrestin Arrestins are soluble cytoplasmic proteins that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors, thus switching off activation of the G protein and terminating the signalling pathway that triggers the cellular response. Although visual arrestin has been shown to quench the catalytic activity of photoexcited, phosphorylated rhodopsin in a reconstituted system, its role in the intact rod cell remains unclear because phosphorylation alone reduces the catalytic activity of rhodopsin. Here we have recorded photocurrents of rods from transgenic mice in which one or both copies of the arrestin gene were disrupted. Photoresponses were unaffected when arrestin expression was halved, indicating that arrestin binding is not rate limiting for recovery of the rod photoresponse, as it is in Drosophila. With arrestin absent, the flash response displayed a rapid partial recovery followed by a prolonged final phase. This behaviour indicates that an arrestin-independent mechanism initiates the quench of rhodopsin's catalytic activity and that arrestin completes the quench. The intensity dependence of the photoresponse in rods lacking arrestin further suggests that, although arrestin is required for normal signal termination, it does not participate directly in light adaptation.",Excluded
3856,"Phase I trial of escalated doses of targeted marrow/lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) delivered by tomotherapy combined with etoposide and cyclophosphamide; an allogeneic HCT preparative regimen for patients with refractory leukemia Introduction: The overall survival (OS) for relapsed (RL) acute leukemia patients or those considered induction failure (IF) treated with HCT is 16-19% (Duval et al., JCO 2010). While randomized studies have shown a dose response relationship, with higher doses of radiation resulting in decreased relapse, this benefit is off set by increased treatment related mortality. Materials (or patients) and Methods: To explore the safety and tolerability of targeted radiation treatment in the context of HCT, a phase I trial is being conducted in which escalated doses of targeted whole body radiation is delivered to marrow bearing and lymphoid areas, while sparing non hematopoietic (vital) organs. The transplant preparative regimen is as follows: TMLI on days -10 to -6; etoposide 60mg/kg [adj bw] on day -5 with cyclophosphamide 100mg/kg [ideal bw] on day -3. The radiation dose was started at 1200cGy delivered in 150 cGy fractions twice a day. Initially the dose of radiation was escalated in increments of 150 cGy to 1500 cGy using standard 3x3 design and then 100 cGy incrementally to a maximum of 2000 cGy using rolling 6 design. Dose limiting toxicity is defined according to the Bearman and CTCAE 3.0 (for hematologic toxicity) scales. Liver and brain dose was kept at 1200 cGy. Median normal organs received 16-60% of the marrow dose (lung 44%, esophagus 33% and oral cavity 28%). All patients received peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and sirolimus. Result(s): To date, a total of 41 patients have been transplanted; from 3/14/2008 to 10/3/2013. Patient characteristics: AML n=27, ALL Ph- n=10, ALL Ph+ n=2, Biphenotypic n=2; disease status at HCT, 1RL n=13, 2RL n=2, IF n=26; cytogenetic risk(SWOG criteria): intermediate n=19, unfavorable n=15 and unknown significance n=7 median KPS at HCT 90 (60-100); donor source sibling n=20, HLA matched unrelated n=5, mismatched (1 allele) unrelated n=16; WBC at HCT median 1.5 (0.1-14.9) % blasts (blood) at HCT median 2% (0-85%) % blasts (marrow) at HCT median 46% (10-90%) Two patients presented with extramedullary disease at time of HCT. With a median follow-up for alive patients of 9.9 months (1.0- 53.4), the OS and cumulative incidence of relapse/progression at 1 year are 52% (95%CI: 32.9-68.1) and 45% (95%CI: 30.9-65.5) respectively. Two patients are currently being treated at 1900 cGy dose, MTD has not been declared. All patients treated at >= 1700 cGy achieved CR at the day 30 post transplant evaluation. Twenty (49%) of patients developed acute GvHD; 6(30%) of these developed grades 3-4. The day 30 and day 100 NRM was 0% and 5.3% respectively. The most common toxicity across the dose levels tested is grade 1 GI and grade 2 stomatitis (Bearman Scale). Causes of death were disease progression/persistent disease n=14, GvHD n=1 and infection n=1. Discussion(s): These results are encouraging and suggest that 1) doses of TMLI can be safely escalated to 1800 cGy in combination with etoposide and cyclophosphamide (MTD not reached, dose escalation will continue to 2000 cGy); 2) all patients treated with >=1700 cGy achieved a CR at the day 30 evaluation and that 3) a reduction in relapse/progression compared to published reports can be achieved without increasing NRM using targeted whole body radiation in this high risk population.",Excluded

The purpose was to gain detailed information on seed displacement patterns in different sectors of the prostate.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 33 patients with stranded seed implants the seed geometry and the dose distribution were compared between the situation in the OR just after the procedure, based on ultrasound images, and the situation after 1month, based on registered CT and MR images.RESULTS: There was a substantial displacement of ventral seeds of 3.8+/-2.5mm in caudal direction (p<0.001). Of these ventral seeds cranially located seeds moved more than caudally located seeds, 4.5+/-2.7mm and 2.9+/-2.6mm, respectively (p<0.001).

The MEP sizes in the ACL lesion legs and the healthy control were not significantly different. The ACL lesion legs showed lower SICI and higher ICF compared to the healthy control group (P < 0.05). After ES, the quadriceps VA level increased and the SICI-ICF was modulated only in the ACL lesion legs (P < 0.05) but not in the healthy controls.Conclusions: Low-intensity ES can normalize the modulation of intracortical inhibition and facilitation, thereby ameliorating the activation failure in individuals with ACL lesion.",Excluded

We evaluated our experience with radiosurgical and microsurgical treatment alone and in combination for the management of NVCNS.METHODS: The charts of 62 patients with NVCNS who were treated between 1993 and 2005 at our institution were reviewed. Patients diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 2 were excluded. The patients underwent microsurgery and/or radiosurgery treatment.RESULTS: Trigeminal and jugular foramen schwannomas were the most common NVCNS tumors (n = 47), and the only two groups with sufficient numbers of patients to allow comparison of the three treatment approaches. In these two groups, the mean tumor volume was significantly higher in those who received combined therapy (8.59 +/- 2.29 cc), compared with radiosurgery (4.94 +/- 3.02 cc; p = 0.05) or microsurgery alone (5.38 +/- 3.23; p = 0.027). Patients who underwent radiosurgery alone were significantly older (67.7 +/- 13.3 years; p = 0.019) than those treated with microsurgery (55.3 +/- 13.7 years) or with both modalities (48.7 +/- 12.8 years). The Karnofsky Performance Scale scores were significantly higher (p < or = 0.05) at follow-up compared with baseline for all three treatment approaches. There was no significant change in the Glasgow Outcome scores before and after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgery and radiosurgery can both be used to manage NVCNS tumors with excellent results. When treatment with either modality alone is not reasonable, tumors can be managed effectively with combined micro- and radiosurgery treatment.",Included

3668,"A reappraisal of the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited small cell lung cancer The use of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited stage small cell lung cancer remains controversial. Prospective trials have demonstrated that PCI can reduce central nervous system relapse rates, but the impact on survival remains questionable except for the possible evidence of a beneficial effect for long term survivors. With higher rates of thoracic control now obtainable with hyperfractionated radiation and concomitant chemotherapy, it becomes important to analyze the benefit of PCI in that setting. Before 1982, we included PCI in the management of all patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer; thereafter, we discontinued its use. This report compares the outcome of the two treatment approaches and addresses the role of PCI among patients who achieve durable local control. There were 36 limited stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with PCI from 1979-1982 and 26 patients treated without PCI from 1985-1989. Induction chemotherapy was followed in both groups by thoracic irradiation (45 Gy). The PCI patients received 30 Gy to the whole brain in 10 fractions. Both groups received maintenance chemotherapy. Of complete responders, brain failure was the first failure in 18% (4/22) of PCI (+) versus 45% (10/22) of PCI (-) (p = .04). Survival at 2 years was 42% for PCI (+) versus 13% for PCI (-) (p less than .05). When the analysis was limited to those patients permanently controlled in the thorax; there were 25% (4/16) brain failures PCI (+) versus 70% (7/10) PCI (-) (p = .03). For this same subset the 2-year survival was 56% PCI (+) versus 14% PCI (-) (p less than .05). There were no 5 year survivors without PCI compared to 38% (6/16) with PCI. These data suggest that PCI appears to be effective in enhancing survival of patients who achieve durable thoracic control. Prospective trials are necessary to evaluate the use of PCI combined with therapeutic regimens with a documented ability to achieve high rates of sustained control of thoracic disease.",Excluded

In this work, we report our comprehensive quality assurance (QA) procedure for commissioning this TPS. First, the accuracy of stereotaxy established with a body frame was checked to ensure accurate determination of a target position within the planning system. Second, the CT-to-electron density conversion curve used in the TPS was fitted to our site-specific measurement data to ensure the accuracy of dose calculation and measurement verification in a QA phantom. Using the QA phantom, the radiological path lengths were verified against known geometrical depths to ensure the accuracy of the ray-tracing algorithm. We also checked inter- and intraleaf leakage/transmission for adequate jaw settings. Measurements for dose verification were performed in various head/neck and prostate IMRT treatment plans using the patient-specific optimized fluence maps. Both ion chamber and film were used for point dose and isodose distribution verifications. To ensure that adjacent organs at risk receive dose within the expectation, we used the Monte Carlo method to calculate dose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for these organs at risk. The dosimetric accuracy satisfied the published acceptability criteria. The Monte Carlo calculations confirmed the measured dose distributions for target volumes. For organs located on the beam boundary or outside the beam, some differences in the DVHs were noticed. However, the plans calculated by both methods met our clinical criteria.

A total of 19 patients, each with two large brain metastases, were enrolled. The dose prescribed for each planning target volume (PTV) was 28 Gy in five fractions (D99.8 = 100%). We created new indices derived from conformity indices suggested by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG; mRTOG-CI) and Paddick et al. (mIP-CI), using the dosimetric parameters of the sum of the two PTVs. The median PTV was 5.05 cm3 (range, 2.10-28.47). VMAT significantly improved mRTOG-CI and mIP-CI compared with DCAT. In all cases, VMAT was able to improve mRTOG-CI and mIP-CI compared with DCAT. Whereas the normal brain volume receiving 5 Gy was similar between the two modalities, the normal brain receiving 10, 12, 15, 20, 25 and 28 Gy (V10-V28) was significantly smaller in VMAT. The mean beam-on times were 213.3 s and 121.9 s in DCAT and VMAT, respectively (P < 0.001). Mono-isocentric VMAT improved the target conformity and reduced the beam-on time and V10-V28 of the normal brain for not only two close metastases but also two distant metastases. Mono-isocentric VMAT seems to be a promising treatment technique for two large brain metastases.",Excluded
4101,"Linac-Based Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy with a Micro-Multileaf Collimator for Brainstem Metastasis BACKGROUND: To assess the neuroimaging and clinical outcomes in patients with brainstem metastasis (BSM) treated with linac-based fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (fSRT) with a micro-multileaf collimator.METHODS: Between May 2007 and January 2017, 24 patients (15 male and 9 female) with BSM (25 lesions: midbrain, 10; pons, 13; and medulla oblongata, 2) were consecutively treated with linac-based fSRT. BSM originated from the lung (n = 18, 75.0%), colon (n = 3, 12.5%), and breast (n = 3, 12.5%). The median patient age was 67.0 (range: 42-80) years. Recursive partition analysis classified 2 patients as class I, 17 as class II, and 5 as class III. Overall survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Tumor volume ranged from 0.01 to 7.49 cm<sup>3</sup> (median: 0.233 cm<sup>3</sup>), and patients were treated with a dose of 24-40 Gy in 7-13 fractions. The median OS was 9 months after fSRT (95% confidence interval 4.104-13.896). Large tumor volume, presence of brainstem-related symptoms, poor pretreatment Karnofsky performance status, and recursive partition analysis class III were significantly associated with low overall survival. Tumor volume decreased in 18 metastatic lesions, remained stable in 6, and increased in 1. No patient exhibited permanent radiation injury. Grade 2 nausea and vomiting according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.0 occurred in 1 patient who received corticosteroids.CONCLUSIONS: Linac-based fSRT with a micro-multileaf collimator delivered in the doses of 24-40 Gy in 7-13 fractions is a safe and effective local therapy for patients with BSM.",Excluded
3953,"Radiation-induced changes in the profile of spinal cord serotonin, prostaglandin synthesis, and vascular permeability PURPOSE: To investigate the profile of biochemical and physiological changes induced in the rat spinal cord by radiation, over a period of 8 months.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The thoraco-lumbar spinal cords of Fisher rats were irradiated to a dose of 15 Gy. The rats were then followed and killed at various times afterward. Serotonin (5-HT) and its major metabolite 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) were assayed as well as prostaglandin synthesis. Microvessel permeability was assessed by quantitative evaluation of Evans blue dye extravasation.RESULTS: None of the rats developed neurologic dysfunction, and histologic examination revealed only occasional gliosis in the ventral white matter at 240 days after irradiation. Serotonin levels were unchanged at 2, 14, and 56 days after radiation but increased at 120 and 240 days in the irradiated cord segments when compared to both the nonirradiated thoracic and cervical segments (p < 0.01) and age-matched controls (p < 0.03). The calculated utilization ratio of serotonin (5-HIAA/5-HT) remained unchanged. Immediately after radiation (at 3 and 24 h) an abrupt but brief increase in the synthesis of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), thromboxane (TXB2), and prostacyclin [6 keto-PGF1 alpha (6KPGF)] was noted, which returned to normal at 3 days. This was followed after 7 and 14 days by a significant fall off in synthesis of all three prostaglandins. Thereafter, at 28, 56, 120, and 240 days, escalated production of thromboxane followed, while prostacyclin synthesis remained markedly reduced (-88% of control level at 240 days). Up to 7 days after radiation the calculated TXB2/6KPGF ratio remained balanced, regardless of the observed abrupt early fluctuations in their rate of synthesis. Later, between 7 and 240 days after radiation, a significant imbalance was present which became more pronounced over time. In the first 24 h after radiation, a 104% increase in microvessel permeability was observed which returned to normal by 3 days. Normal permeability was maintained at 14 and 28 days, but at 120 and 240 days a persistent and significant increase of 98% and 73% respectively above control level was noted.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation induces severe impairment in microvessel function even in the histologically unaffected spinal cord, and alters the secretory phenotype of various cell systems in the central nervous system.",Included
4625,"Dosimetric analysis of the brachial plexus among patients with breast cancer treated with post-mastectomy radiotherapy to the ipsilateral supraclavicular area: report of 3 cases of radiation-induced brachial plexus neuropathy BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the brachial plexus (BP) dose of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) to the ipsilateral supraclavicular (ISCL) area, and report the characteristics of radiation-induced brachial plexus neuropathy (RIBPN).METHODS: The BP dose of 31 patients who received adjuvant PMRT to the ISCL area and chest wall using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and the records of 3 patients with RIBPN were retrospectively analyzed based on the standardized Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-endorsed guidelines. The total dose to the ISCL area and chest wall was 50 Gy in 25 fractions.RESULTS: Patients with a higher number of removed lymph nodes (RLNs) had a higher risk of RIBPN (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.189, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.005-1.406, p = 0.044). In 31 patients treated with 3DCRT, the mean dose to the BP without irradiation to the ISCL area was significantly less than that with irradiation to the ISCL area (0.97 +/- 0.20 vs. 44.39 +/- 4.13 Gy, t = 136.75, p <0.001). In the 3DCRT plans with irradiation to the ISCL area and chest wall, the maximum dose to the BP was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.40, p = 0.026), body mass index (BMI) (r = -0.44, p = 0.014), and body weight (r = -0.45, p = 0.011). Symptoms of the 3 patients with RIBPN occurred 37-65 months after radiotherapy, and included progressive upper extremity numbness, pain, and motor disturbance. After treatment, 1 patient was stable, and the other 2 patients' symptoms worsened.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of RIBPN was higher in patients with a higher number of RLNs after PMRT. The dose to the BP is primarily from irradiation of the ISCL area, and is higher in slim and young patients. Prevention should be the main focus of managing RIBPN, and the BP should be considered an organ-at-risk when designing a radiotherapy plan for the ISCL area.",Excluded
4269,"Modulation of cone horizontal cell activity in the teleost fish retina. III. Effects of prolonged darkness and dopamine on electrical coupling between horizontal cells The effects of prolonged darkness and dopamine on the coupling between horizontal cells in the isolated, superfused white perch retina were studied. Two assays of coupling were employed; area versus amplitude relationships (area-response curves) and the diffusion of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow from intracellularly injected cells to neighboring cells. In prolonged dark-adapted retinas, area-response curves were difficult to determine because of the small light responses; however, light-evoked responses did not increase in size when light spots were larger than 0.8 mm in diameter. Following the presentation of dim background illumination that partially sensitized the retina, responses to light spots of various sizes were enhanced and an area-response curve could be constructed. Subsequent presentation of moderate background illumination that more fully sensitized the retina resulted in reduced responses to small spots (less than 1.6 mm in diameter) and enhanced responses to large spot or full-field stimuli. In retinas exposed to moderate background illumination, Lucifer yellow injected intracellularly into cone horizontal cells diffused into many neighboring horizontal cells. The coupled cells were very similar in morphology, suggesting they were of the same type. In prolonged dark-adapted retinas, on the other hand, the dye was usually restricted to the injected cell and a few adjacent cells. These results indicate that coupling between cone horizontal cells is modulated by prolonged darkness and background illumination. Following dopamine (50 microM) application, in both 6-OHDA-treated and untreated retinas, changes in area-response curves of cone horizontal cells were observed just opposite to those that occurred when prolonged dark-adapted retinas were exposed to background illumination. That is, following 5 min application of dopamine to the retina, responses to small spots (less than 2 mm in diameter) increased in size while responses to larger spots decreased in amplitude compared with control responses. Following 20 min of superfusion with dopamine, the recorded responses were very small, and an accurate area-response curve could not be determined. Following dopamine application to light-sensitized retinas, Lucifer yellow was restricted to the injected cells or to the injected cell and a few neighboring cells. The results suggest that the modulation of coupling between cone horizontal cells by prolonged darkness and background illumination may be mediated by dopamine. Spatial properties of rod horizontal cells were also examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Excluded
4217,"[Intensity-modulated radiotherapy of head and neck cancers: Dose effects on the ocular, orbital and eyelid structures] Radiation-induced damage of ocular, orbital and eyelid structures are mainly reported for the optic nerve, retina, lens and lacrimal gland. Dose-volume relationships are, however, inaccurate due to the small volume of most of the organs at risk involved and limited ability of irradiation techniques to spare these structures in the pre-IMRT (intensity-modulated radiation therapy) era. The ability of newest radiation techniques including IMRT and proton therapy to generate steep dose gradients may yield more accurate models in the future. Some toxicities are severe and irreversible, leading to vision loss, as in the case of radiation-induced optic neuropathy for which curative treatments are suboptimal. Other toxicities can lead to reversible vision loss but can be surgically corrected, as is the case for radiation-induced cataract. In this paper, we will review the dose effects for the ocular; orbital and eyelid structures.",Excluded
3827,"Wwox-Brca1 interaction: role in DNA repair pathway choice In this study, loss of expression of the fragile site-encoded Wwox protein was found to contribute to radiation and cisplatin resistance of cells, responses that could be associated with cancer recurrence and poor outcome. WWOX gene deletions occur in a variety of human cancer types, and reduced Wwox protein expression can be detected early during cancer development. We found that Wwox loss is followed by mild chromosome instability in genomes of mouse embryo fibroblast cells from Wwox-knockout mice. Human and mouse cells deficient for Wwox also exhibit significantly enhanced survival of ionizing radiation and bleomycin treatment, agents that induce double-strand breaks (DSBs). Cancer cells that survive radiation recur more rapidly in a xenograft model of irradiated breast cancer cells; Wwox-deficient cells exhibited significantly shorter tumor latencies vs Wwox-expressing cells. This Wwox effect has important consequences in human disease: in a cohort of cancer patients treated with radiation, Wwox deficiency significantly correlated with shorter overall survival times. In examining mechanisms underlying Wwox-dependent survival differences, we found that Wwox-deficient cells exhibit enhanced homology directed repair (HDR) and decreased non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair, suggesting that Wwox contributes to DNA DSB repair pathway choice. Upon silencing of Rad51, a protein critical for HDR, Wwox-deficient cells were resensitized to radiation. We also demonstrated interaction of Wwox with Brca1, a driver of HDR, and show via immunofluorescent detection of repair proteins at ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage foci that Wwox expression suppresses DSB repair at the end-resection step of HDR. We propose a genome caretaker function for WWOX, in which Brca1-Wwox interaction supports NHEJ as the dominant DSB repair pathway in Wwox-sufficient cells. Taken together, the experimental results suggest that reduced Wwox expression, a common occurrence in cancers, dysregulates DSB repair, enhancing efficiency of likely mutagenic repair, and enabling radiation and cisplatin treatment resistance.",Excluded
4253,"A mouse model replicating hippocampal sparing cranial irradiation in humans: A tool for identifying new strategies to limit neurocognitive decline Cancer patients undergoing cranial irradiation are at risk of developing neurocognitive impairments. Recent evidence suggests that radiation-induced injury to the hippocampi could play an important role in this cognitive decline. As a tool for studying the mechanisms of hippocampal-dependent cognitive decline, we developed a mouse model replicating the results of the recent clinical RTOG 0933 study of hippocampal sparing whole-brain irradiation. We irradiated 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice to a single dose of 10 Gy using either whole-brain irradiation (WBRT) or hippocampal sparing irradiation (HSI). These animals, as well as sham-irradiated controls, were subjected to behavioral/cognitive assessments distinguishing between hippocampal-dependent and hippocampal-independent functions. Irradiation was well tolerated by all animals and only limited cell death of proliferating cells was found within the generative zones. Animals exposed to WBRT showed significant deficits compared to sham-irradiated controls in the hippocampal-dependent behavioral task. In contrast, HSI mice did not perform significantly different from sham-irradiated mice (control group) and performed significantly better when compared to WBRT mice. This is consistent with the results from the RTOG 0933 clinical trial, and as such this animal model could prove a helpful tool for exploring new strategies for mitigating cognitive decline in cancer patients receiving cranial irradiation.",Included
4657,"A link between vascular damage and cognitive deficits after whole-brain radiation therapy for cancer: A clue to other types of dementia? Whole brain radiation therapy for the treatment of tumors can sometimes cause cognitive impairment. Memory deficits were noted in up to 50% of treated patients over a short period of several months. In addition, an increased rate of dementia in young patients has been noted over the longer term, i.e. years. A deficit in neurogenesis after irradiation has been postulated to be the main cause of cognitive decline in patients, but recent data on irradiation therapy for limited parts of the brain appear to indicate other possibilities. Irradiation can directly damage various types of cells other than neuronal stem cells. However, this paper will focus on injury to brain vasculature leading to cognitive decline since vessels represent a better therapeutic target for drug development than other cells in the brain because of the blood-brain barrier.",Excluded
4513,"The alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist TC-2559 impairs long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus in vivo Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) are widely expressed throughout the nervous system, are involved in some fast excitatory neurotransmission, and play an important role in modulating the release of several neurotransmitters, including the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA. We used a recently characterised alpha4beta2 nAChR subunit selective partial agonist, TC-2559, to study the effect of alpha4beta2 nAChR activation on synaptic plasticity in the medio-dorsal perforant pathway input to the dentate gyrus, in the intact nervous system in vivo. We show for the first time, that the selective activation of alpha4beta2 containing nAChR can reduce the level of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high frequency stimulation, an effect that was reversed by the selective antagonist, dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DbetaHE). This modulator role of nAChRs is in contrast to previous findings that used broad spectrum agonists, highlighting the complex actions of nicotine.",Excluded

4229,"Reactive gliosis in the adult zebrafish retina In contrast to mammals, zebrafish posses the remarkable ability to regenerate retinal neurons. Damage to the zebrafish retina induces Muller glia to act as stem cells, generating retinal progenitors for regeneration. In contrast, injury in the mammalian retina results in Muller glial reactive gliosis, a characteristic gliotic response that is normally detrimental to vision. Understanding the signaling pathways that determine how Muller glia respond to injury is a critical step toward promoting regeneration in the mammalian retina. Here we report that zebrafish Muller glia exhibit signs of reactive gliosis even under normal regenerative conditions and that cell cycle inhibition increases this response. Persistently reactive Muller glia increase their neuroprotective functions, temporarily saving photoreceptors from a cytotoxic light lesion. However, the absence of a sustained proliferation response results in a significant inhibition of retinal regeneration. Interestingly, when cell cycle inhibition is released, a partial recovery of regeneration is observed. Together, these data demonstrate that zebrafish Muller glia possess both gliotic and regenerative potential.",Excluded

The aim of the present study was to make an appropriate exposure assessment of RF welding and examine the health status of the operators. In total, 35 RF operators and 37 controls were included. The leakage fields (electric and magnetic field strength) were measured, as well as induced and contact current. Information about welding time and productivity was used to calculate time integrated exposure. A neurophysiological examination and 24 h ECG were also carried out. The participants also had to answer a questionnaire about subjective symptoms. The measurements showed that RF operators were exposed to rather intense electric and magnetic fields. The mean values of the calculated 6 min, spatially averaged E and H field strengths, in line with ICNIRP reference levels, are 107 V/m and 0.24 A/m, respectively. The maximum measured field strengths were 2 kV/m and 1.5 A/m, respectively. The induced current in ankles and wrists varied, depending on the work situation, with a mean value of 101 mA and a maximum measured value of 1 A. In total, 11 out of 46 measured RF plastic sealers exceeded the ICNIRP reference levels. RF operators, especially the ready made clothing workers had a slightly disturbed two-point discrimination ability compared to a control group. A nonsignificant difference between RF operators and controls was found in the prevalence of subjective symptoms, but the time integrated exposure parameters seem to be of importance to the prevalence of some subjective symptoms: fatigue, headaches, and warmth sensations in the hands. Further, RF operators had a significantly lower heart rate (24 h registration) and more episodes of bradycardia compared to controls.",Excluded

The region of visual space within which saccades are delayed is called a delay field. We examined the effects of changing the parameters of stimulation and target size on the size of a delay field. Rhesus monkeys were required to generate a saccadic eye movement to a punctate and white visual target presented within or outside the receptive field of the neurons under study. On 50% of trials, a train of stimulation consisting of 0.2-ms anode-first pulses was delivered to the neurons before the onset of the visual target. Stimulations were performed in the operculum at 0.9-2.0 mm below the cortical surface. It was found that increases in current (50-100 microA), pulse frequency (100-300 Hz), or train duration (75-300 ms) increased the size of a delay field and increases in target size (0.1 degrees -0.2 degrees of visual angle) decreased the size of a delay field. Delay fields varied in size between 0.1 and 0.6 degrees of visual angle.

4435,"Interstitial irradiation with stereotactically implanted I-125 seeds for the treatment of cerebral glioma Owing to its low rate of side effects and its high efficacy, interstitial irradiation with low-activity seeds should be the first therapeutic step in small (maximal diameter 40 mm), well-circumscribed, low-grade gliomas affecting the brain stem, other midline structures, or eloquent cerebral areas. In anaplastic gliomas, a therapeutic schedule using low-activity seeds and combining interstitial irradiation with radiotherapy (reduced boost dose of 15-30 Gy) seems to be more effective than interstitial irradiation alone. Compared with interstitial irradiation with high-activity seeds, this combined irradiation schedule caused no space-occupying radiation necrosis. Thus, it can be recommended as up-front treatment in patients with small (maximal diameter <40 mm) inoperable anaplastic gliomas. The use of high-activity I-125 seeds and interstitial irradiation at comparably high dose rates, integrating a small penumbra of normal brain tissue into the treatment volume, improved survival significantly in patients with primary highly malignant gliomas. In patients with recurrent tumors, the same treatment schedule did not substantially prolong survival compared with results obtained after resection plus radiotherapy. Owing to the high frequency of space-occupying radiation necrosis (40-60%), this schedule is only applicable in surgically accessible tumors. The application of low-activity I-125 seeds (in primary glioblastomas in combination with radiotherapy, in recurrent tumors without radiotherapy) yielded a median survival comparable with conventionally treated patients. There was no need for reoperation because of radiation necrosis. Thus, this treatment schedule is useful in both operable and surgically inaccessible glioblastomas.",Excluded

The proposed method has been demonstrated to identify functional pathways implicated in fMRI task. It can effectively follow tracts in the genu of the corpus callosum that connects to the frontal lobe cortex, obtain connections between the thalamus and the anterior insula under sensory simulation, and reconstruct optic radiations in the visual circuit under visual stimulation.

3763,"Absorbed doses to kidneys based on one or two SPECT measurements versus three SPECT measurements in 777 patients with neuroendocrine tumours receiving<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE therapy Aim/Introduction: As in all therapies using ionizing radiation, a patient-specific optimization of the delivered radiation should be performed in therapy with<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE. At our centre, the number of treatments is based on the absorbed dose (AD) to the kidneys. For logistical reasons, estimation of absorbed doses should be performed with as few measurements as possible. The aim of the present work was to study how well kidney AD and effective half-life (t<inf>eff</inf>) estimations using methods with one or two measurement points agree with the method we use today that is based on three imaging points. Material(s) and Method(s): 777 patients (333 female and 444 male) with neuroendocrine tumors with high somatostatin receptor expression were included. SPECT/CT over the abdomen were acquired at 24, 96 and 168 h after start of infusion of<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE. AD and teff were calculated using single exponential fits to data from 3 measurements (24-96-168) or two measurements (24- 96 and 24-168). In addition, absorbed doses were calculated using a single measurement, assuming t<inf>eff</inf>50 h (96/50h). Bias of AD and teff values relative to those based on the three-point measurement were calculated. To test statistical significance a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test with a P-value of 0.05 for significance was used. Median, Min and Max of the deviations were also calculated. Result(s): Bias versus AD(24-96- 168) was -3%(-20-72) (Median (Min-Max)) for AD(24-96), 3%(-22- 30) for AD(24-168) and -7%(-51-27) for AD(96/50h). The bias for teff in the AD calculations versus AD(24-96-168) was -9% (-53- 63) for AD(24-96) and 0% (-9-4) for AD(24-168). In all tests there was a small but significant difference for the whole group. In about 15% of the patients the bias in t<inf>eff</inf>was more than 20% when ignoring the 168-h scan. In about 5-10% of the patients AD differed more than 20% for all methods that excluded the 168-h measurement. Using a fixed limit of the absorbed dose to the kidneys, this would mean that these patients would be given either too many or too few treatments. Conclusion(s): Although absorbed dose calculations based on only one or two measurement points may serve as a good approximation for the majority of patients, it leads to substantial errors affecting the number of given treatments in about 10% of patients. Since this is a radiation treatment a high precision for all patients is warranted, and three measurements, or at least inclusion of a late 168-h measurement, are recommended.",Excluded

Detailed effects of PCI on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are reported here. Patients and Methods Patients (age, 18 to 75 years; WHO <= 2) with ED-SCLC, and any response to chemotherapy, were randomly assigned to either observation or PCI. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and patient-reported symptoms were secondary end points. The European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer core HRQOL tool (Quality of Life Questionnaire C30) and brain module (Quality of Life Questionnaire Brain Cancer Module) were used to collect self-reported patient data. Six HRQOL scales were selected as primary HRQOL end points: global health status; hair loss; fatigue; and role, cognitive and emotional functioning. Assessments were performed at random assignment, 6 weeks, 3 months, and then 3-monthly up to 1 year and 6-monthly thereafter. Results Compliance with the HRQOL assessment was 93.7% at baseline and dropped to 60% at 6 weeks. Short-term results up to 3 months showed that there was a negative impact of PCI on selected HROOL scales. The largest mean difference between the two arms was observed for fatigue and hair loss. The impact of PCI on global health status as well as on functioning scores was more limited. For global health status, the observed mean difference was eight points on a scale 0 to 100 at 6 weeks (P = .018) and 3 months (P = .055).

Clinicians should be alert to these; monitor their patients; and offer appropriate support, clinical, and psychosocial care. ©2008 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
4651,"Control of brain metastases from radioresistant tumors treated by stereotactic radiosurgery Renal cell carcinoma, sarcoma, and melanoma are considered to be ""radioresistant"" tumor histologies. Brain metastases (BM) from these tumors are considered unlikely to be controlled using the relatively low doses used in whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Our objective was to analyze the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on local control and overall survival of BM from radioresistant primary tumors. We reviewed all patients who received Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) for BM at Columbia University Medical Center between January 2009 and April 2014. All patients were treated using the Gamma Knife Perfexion System. Dosimetric data was collected from treatment plans and metastases were categorized as radioresistant or not. Response was assessed by reviewing follow-up brain imaging studies and classified according to RECIST. Local control and median overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. In total, 373 tumors were analyzed from 126 patients. Of these tumors, 49 (13.1 %) originated from radioresistant cancers. The overall local control rate in the radioresistant cohort was 89.8 and 90.1 % in the non-radioresistant cohort. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that radioresistance status of the primary tumor had no statistically significant effect on local control with hazard ratios of 1.0 (p = 1.0, 95 % CI 0.388-2.576) and 0.954 (p = 0.926, 95 % CI 0.349-2.603) respectively. Median overall survival for both radioresistant and non-radioresistant cohorts was 20.0 months, with a p value of 0.926. There was no significant difference in local control of BM from radioresistant and non-radioresistant primary tumors treated with GKRS. Both cohorts showed excellent response and local control, suggesting that SRS upfront or in addition to WBRT may be an appropriate strategy in the treatment of BM from radioresistant cancers. Median overall survival for both cohorts was equal, suggesting that improved local control may be associated with an improvement in long-term survival.",Excluded
4639,"Cognitive impairment and spontaneous epilepsy in rats with malformations of cortical development Purpose: To examine the cognition, spontaneous epilepsy, and electroencephalography (EEG) characteristics of rats with malformations of cortical development (MCD) and their use as an animal model for investigating the pathogenesis of intractable epilepsy and screening novel antiepileptic drugs. Method(s): An epileptic rat model of MCD was established with the F1 generation of pregnant rats after X-irradiation with 175 cGy (Group L), 195 cGy (Group M), or 215 cGy (Group H). Long-term video-EEG monitoring was used to record the seizures in the rats with MCD. Cognition was assessed with the Morris water maze. The EEGs were recorded and analyzed in the frontal and parietal lobes and hippocampi of adult rats. Finally, the brain tissues were processed for Nissl staining. Result(s): The model groups exhibited markedly prolonged escape latencies and distinct decrements in the percent distance traveled in the target quadrant and platform-crossing frequency. These findings were dose-dependent. Frequent interictal epileptiform discharges were observed in the frontal and parietal lobes and hippocampi of adult rats, and their incidences were markedly higher in the model groups compared with that in the normal controls, with Group M having the highest incidence. Spontaneous seizures were observed in the model groups (mean incidence, 46.7%). The daily mean frequency of seizures and the incidence of spontaneous seizures were highest in Group M. Nissl staining revealed a dose-dependent pattern of hippocampal abnormalities, cortical and subcortical nodular heterotopia, and callosal agenesis in the model groups.

4049,"Gamma Knife surgery for patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas: Predictors of tumor control, neurological deficits, and hypopituitarism - Clinical article Object. Nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas often recur after microsurgery and thereby require further treatment. Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) has been used to treat recurrent adenomas. In this study, the authors evaluated outcomes following GKS of nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas and assessed predictors of tumor control, neurological deficits, and delayed hypopituitarism. Methods. Between June 1989 and March 2010, 140 consecutive patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas were treated using GKS at the University of Virginia. The median patient age was 51 years (range 21-82 years), and 56% of patients were male. Mean tumor volume was 5.6 cm3 (range 0.6-35 cm3). Thirteen patients were treated with GKS as primary therapy, and 127 had undergone at least 1 open resection prior to GKS. Ninety-three patients had a history of hormone therapy prior to GKS. The mean maximal dose of GKS was 38.6 Gy (range 10-70 Gy), the mean marginal dose was 18 Gy (range 5-25 Gy), and the mean number of isocenters was 9.8 (range 1-26). Follow-up evaluations were performed in all 140 patients, ranging from 0.5 to 17 years (mean 5 years, median 4.2 years). Results. Tumor volume remained stable or decreased in 113 (90%) of 125 patients with available follow-up imaging. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated radiographic progression free survival at 2, 5, 8, and 10 years to be 98%, 97%, 91%, and 87%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, a tumor volume greater than 5 cm3 (hazard ratio = 5.0, 95% CI 1.5-17.2; p = 0.023) was the only factor predictive of tumor growth. The median time to tumor progression was 14.5 years. Delayed hypopituitarism occurred in 30.3% of patients. No factor was predictive of post-GKS hypopituitarism. A new or worsening cranial nerve deficit occurred in 16 (13.7%) of 117 patients. Visual decline was the most common neurological deficit (12.8%), and all patients experiencing visual decline had evidence of tumor progression. In multivariate analysis, a tumor volume greater than 5 cm3 (OR = 3.7, 95% CI 1.2-11.7; p = 0.025) and pre-GKS hypopituitarism (OR = 7.5, 95% CI 1.1-60.8; p = 0.05) were predictive of a new or worsened neurological deficit. Conclusions. In patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas, GKS confers a high rate of tumor control and a low rate of neurological deficits. The most common complication following GKS is delayed hypopituitarism, and this occurs in a minority of patients.",Excluded
4236,"Effects of Amifostine Pre-treatment on MIRNA, LNCRNA, and MRNA Profiles in the Hypothalamus of Mice Exposed to 60Co Gamma Radiation There is increasing evidence that the expression of non-coding RNA and mRNA (messenger RNA) is significantly altered following high-dose ionizing radiation (IR), and their expression may play a critical role in cellular responses to IR. However, the role of non-coding RNA and mRNA in radiation protection, especially in the nervous system, remains unknown. In this study, microarray profiles were used to determine microRNA (miRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and mRNA expression in the hypothalamus of mice that were pretreated with amifostine and subsequently exposed to high-dose IR. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed. We found that fewer miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs were induced by amifostine pre-treatment in exposed mice, which exhibited antagonistic effects compared to IR, indicating that amifostine attenuated the IR-induced effects on RNA profiles. GO and KEGG pathway analyses showed changes in a variety of signaling pathways involved in inflammatory responses during radioprotection following amifostine pre-treatment in exposed mice. Taken together, our study revealed that amifostine treatment altered or attenuated miRNA, lncRNA, and mRNA expression in the hypothalamus of exposed mice. These data provide a resource to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying amifostine-mediated radioprotection in the hypothalamus.",Included

By histologic and histochemical methods, indications of increased activities of the hypothalamicpituitary neurosecretory system and the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys were found. The changes were reversible and by the 27th postflight day returned to the normal. It is suggested that the changes in the above systems may be produced not only by flight effects but also by readaptation of animals to 1 g.",Included
4176,"Comparison of responses of neurons in the mouse inferior colliculus to current injections, tones of different durations, and sinusoidal amplitude-modulated tones We made in vivo whole cell patch-clamp recordings from the inferior colliculus of young-adult, anesthetized C57/Bl6 mice to compare the responses to constant-current injections with the responses to tones of different duration or to sinusoidal amplitude-modulated (SAM) tones. We observed that voltage-dependent ion channels contributed in several ways to the response to tones. A sustained response to long tones was observed only in cells showing little accommodation during current injection. Cells showing burst-onset firing during current injection showed a small response to SAM tones, whereas burst-sustained cells showed a good response to SAM tones. The hyperpolarization-activated nonselective cation channel I(h) had a special role in shaping the responses: I(h) was associated with an increased excitability, with chopper and pauser responses, and with an afterhyperpolarization following tones. Synaptic properties were more important in determining the responses to tones of different durations. A short-latency inhibitory response appeared to contribute to the long-pass response in some cells and short-pass and band-pass neurons were characterized by their slow recovery from synaptic adaptation. Cells that recovered slowly from synaptic adaptation showed a relatively small response to SAM tones. Our results show an important role for both intrinsic membrane properties -- most notably the presence of I(h) and the extent of accommodation -- and synaptic adaptation in shaping the response to tones in the inferior colliculus.",Excluded
4268,"Atypical retardation patterns in scanning laser polarimetry are associated with low peripapillary choroidal thickness PURPOSE: Scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) results can be affected by an atypical retardation pattern (ARP). One reason for an ARP is the birefringence of the sclera. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of the peripapillary choroidal thickness (pChTh) on the occurrence of ARP.METHODS: One hundred ten healthy subjects were investigated with SLP and spectral domain OCT. pChTh was measured in B-scan images at 768 positions using semiautomatic software. Values were averaged to 32 sectors and the total peripapillary mean. Subjects were divided into four groups according to the typical scan score (TSS) provided by the GDxVCC: group 1 TSS, 100; group 2 TSS, 90-99; group 3 TSS, 80-89; group 4 TSS, <80.RESULTS: Mean pChTh (+/- SD) in 110 healthy subjects was 141 mum (+/-49 mum). There was a significant correlation between pChTh and TSS (r = 0.608; P < 0.001). In TSS groups 1 to 4, mean pChTh was 168 mum (+/-38 mum), 148 mum (+/- 48 mum), 119 mum (+/-35 mum), and 92 (+/-42 mum). Mean pChTh of TSS groups 3 and 4 was significantly lower than that of TSS group 1 (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Low values of TSS resulting from the appearance of ARP in SLP are associated with low peripapillary choroidal thickness. Reduced choroidal thickness may result in an increased amount of confounding light getting to the SLP light detectors.",Excluded
4240,"Changes in myelin basic protein and demyelination in the rat brain within 3 months of single 2-, 10-, or 30-Gy whole-brain radiation treatments: Laboratory investigation Object. The aim of this study was to determine the relation between changes in myelin basic protein (MBP) levels during the acute and subacute phases of central nervous system injury following whole-brain radiation and delayed demyelination in the radiation-injured brain tissue. Methods. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with single fractions of 2, 10, or 30 Gy of whole-brain radiation. The authors measured MBP gene expression and protein levels in the brain tissue by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at 1 week and 1-3 months following irradiation to monitor myelin changes in the brain. Demyelination was determined with Luxol fast blue myelin staining and routine histopathological and electron microscopy examination of injured brain tissue. The changes in MBP levels in the different animal groups at specific time points were correlated with demyelination in corresponding dose groups. Results. At 1 month after applying the 10 and 30 Gy of radiation, MBP mRNA expression showed a transient but significant decrease, followed by recovery to baseline levels at 3 months after treatment. The MBP levels were decreased by only 70-75% at 1 month after 10 and 30 Gy of radiation. At 2-3 months after applying the higher dose of 30 Gy, however, the MBP levels continued to decline, and typical demyelination changes were observed with myelin staining and ultrastructural examination. Conclusions. The authors' results suggest that the early radiation-induced MBP changes between 1 and 3 months af ter single treatments of 10 and 30 Gy of radiation to the whole brain are indicative of permanent injury shown as de myelination of irradiated brain tissue.",Included
4169,"Oscillotherapeutics - Time-targeted interventions in epilepsy and beyond Oscillatory brain activities support many physiological functions from motor control to cognition. Disruptions of the normal oscillatory brain activities are commonly observed in neurological and psychiatric disorders including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, anxiety/trauma-related disorders, major depressive disorders, and drug addiction. Therefore, these disorders can be considered as common oscillation defects despite having distinct behavioral manifestations and genetic causes. Recent technical advances of neuronal activity recording and analysis have allowed us to study the pathological oscillations of each disorder as a possible biomarker of symptoms. Furthermore, recent advances in brain stimulation technologies enable time- and space-targeted interventions of the pathological oscillations of both neurological disorders and psychiatric disorders as possible targets for regulating their symptoms.",Excluded

4361,"Conventional radiotherapy combined with carbogen breathing and nicotinamide for malignant gliomas High grade malignant gliomas are among the most radioresistant human tumors and total doses up to 80 Gy are inadequate to achieve long-term local control in most of the patients. Hypoxia has been demonstrated in primary brain tumors and may be one of the reasons for their radioresistance. In experimental models carbogen breathing and nicotinamide have been shown to act against hypoxia by different mechanisms and both modalities were tested in 16 patients with supratentorial malignant gliomas in combination with a conventional radiotherapy scheme (50 Gy in 25 daily fractions). The present study was performed to determine the feasibility and toxicity of conventional radiotherapy combined with carbogen breathing and nicotinamide. The unexpectedly high incidence of acute liver toxicity, the possible increase of subacute and late CNS toxicity, and the absence of a higher effectivity led us to reconsider this new treatment modality for patients with malignant gliomas.",Excluded
4493,"EUS-guided celiac ganglion irradiation with iodine-125 seeds for pain control in pancreatic carcinoma: a prospective pilot study BACKGROUND: Celiac plexus neurolysis for the palliative reduction of pain in unresectable pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is safe but provides limited relief. In a previous study, we found that EUS-guided implantation of iodine-125 ((125)I) around the celiac ganglia is a safe procedure and can induce apoptosis of local neurons in a porcine model.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of direct celiac ganglion irradiation with (125)I seeds for the relief of moderate to severe pain secondary to unresectable PC.DESIGN: Prospective study.SETTING: Single, tertiary care referral center.PATIENTS: This study enrolled consecutive patients who had moderate to severe pain resulting from biopsy-proven unresectable PC.INTERVENTION: All patients underwent EUS-guided direct celiac ganglion irradiation with (125)I seeds. Follow-up was conducted at least once weekly until death.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Blood parameters, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, mean analgesic (MS Contin [morphine sulfate]) consumption, and complications were evaluated during follow-up.RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with unresectable PC underwent the procedure. The mean number of seeds implanted in the celiac ganglion per patient was 4 (range 2-6). Immediately after the procedure, pain relief and analgesic consumption showed no significant changes compared with preoperative values. Six patients (26%) reported pain exacerbation. Two weeks later, the VAS score and mean analgesic consumption were significantly less than preoperative values. No procedure-related deaths or major complications occurred.LIMITATIONS: Uncontrolled study.CONCLUSIONS: EUS-guided direct celiac ganglion irradiation with (125)I seeds can reduce the VAS score and analgesic drug consumption in patients with unresectable PC.",Excluded
4282,"Limited disease small cell lung cancer: alternating combination of doxorubicin, etoposide, ifosfamide and hyperfractionated radiotherapy. Final results of a multicentric pilot study for the Groupe Lyonnias d'Oncologie Thoracique (GLOT) In order to evaluate the effect on prolonging survival of alternating chemotherapy and radiotherapy schedules in patients with limited disease small cell lung cancer, 89 patients were included in a multi-institutional pilot study between January 1986 and May 1989. Treatment consisted of induction chemotherapy using the combination of doxorubicin, etoposide and ifosfamide (AVI) for four consecutive courses, followed by two cycles of the VI chemotherapy alternating with three hyperfractionated radiotherapy courses and then followed by two additional courses of AVI. Objective response to the four cycles of AVI combination was observed in 65 patients (75%). Thirteen out of 30 patients (44%) who were in partial response (PR) after induction chemotherapy were converted into complete response (CR) after the three alternating courses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The principal side effect related to combined modality treatment was acute radiation pneumonitis (21.5% cases) reversible except one which resulted in toxic death, and a second with chronic lung fibrosis with permanent WHO Grade 2 dyspnea (14%). Local relapse was observed in 47% of the patients who were considered in CR at the end of the treatment program and cerebral metastases were the first site of detectable relapse in 25% cases. The 3-year actuarial disease-free survival of the 89 patients is 5%, and the median actuarial survival is 14 months. This study shows that the promising survival rates seen in our previously published interim analysis were not maintained. Reasons for this might include the choice of a non cisplatinum containing induction chemotherapy, the late introduction of thoracic irradiation and/or to the use of non-restrictive criteria for selecting patients.",Excluded
4535,"Therapeutic effect of m-[131I]- and m-[125I]iodobenzylguanidine on neuroblastoma multicellular tumor spheroids of different sizes m-[l25I]iodobenzylguanidine (m-[125I]MIBG) has been suggested as an alternative to m-[131I]MIBG for the treatment of metastatic neuroblastoma to achieve a higher radiation dose in micrometastases. To compare these two radiopharmaceuticals, a mathematical model was developed in the present study that allows for the calculation of radiation dose rates within small spherical tumors for different distributions of 131I and 125I. Furthermore, the relationship between tumor size and the therapeutic effects of m-[131I]- and m-[125I]MIBG was studied in vitro using multicellular tumor spheroids of the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH. According to the calculations, higher mean dose rates can be achieved by m-[125I]MIBG than by m-[131I]MIBG up to a tumor diameter of 100 microm when both substances are homogeneously distributed within the tumor. In larger tumors, however, mean dose rates achieved by 131I are up to 8-fold higher. Evaluation of various activity distributions demonstrated that even in tumors of less than 100 microm in diameter, marked heterogeneities of the dose rate can occur when m-[125I]MIBG is not distributed homogeneously. By treatment with m-[131I]MIBG, the growth of tumor spheroids ranging from 100 to 250 microm in diameter was inhibited more effectively in the larger than in the smaller spheroids. The growth inhibition of spheroids treated with m-[125I]MIBG was independent of the spheroid size. In consistency with the calculations, the therapeutic effect of m-[125I]- and m-[131I]MIBG was equal in spheroids with diameters of about 100 microm. In larger spheroids, m-[131I]MIBG induced a more pronounced delay in spheroid growth than m-[125I]MIBG. According to these calculations and in vitro data, m-[125I]MIBG as a single agent does not seem to be a promising alternative to m-[131I]MIBG for treatment of metastatic neuroblastoma. However, the combined use of m-[131I]- and m-[125I]MIBG may be more effective than treatment with m-[131I]MIBG alone.",Excluded

Method(s): This study investigates the safety and efficacy of combining PCI with EGFR TKIs in stage IV NSCLC. Patients with stage IV NSCLC, no evidence of brain metastases, and an indication for first or later line therapy with an EGFR TKI will be enrolled. Those with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) following 6 weeks of therapy and no evidence of brain metastases on MRI will be treated with PCI. Neurocognitive function, depression indices, quality of life, symptoms, and ability to function independantly will be assessed at baseline, before PCI, and at 6 week and then 3 month intervals following PCI. MRI will be repeated 6 weeks following PCI and at 3 month intervals, and serum markers of blood brain barrier permeability (neuron-specific enolase (NSE), protein S100 beta) will be assessed at all visits. Safety data will be formally reviewed after the first 10 patients. The primary endpoint for efficacy is overall survival.

4398,"Pulmonary tissue volume, cardiac output, and diffusing capacity in sustained microgravity In microgravity (microG) humans have marked changes in body fluids, with a combination of an overall fluid loss and a redistribution of fluids in the cranial direction. We investigated whether interstitial pulmonary edema develops as a result of a headward fluid shift or whether pulmonary tissue fluid volume is reduced as a result of the overall loss of body fluid. We measured pulmonary tissue volume (Vti), capillary blood flow, and diffusing capacity in four subjects before, during, and after 10 days of exposure to microG during spaceflight. Measurements were made by rebreathing a gas mixture containing small amounts of acetylene, carbon monoxide, and argon. Measurements made early in flight in two subjects showed no change in Vti despite large increases in stroke volume (40%) and diffusing capacity (13%) consistent with increased pulmonary capillary blood volume. Late in-flight measurements in four subjects showed a 25% reduction in Vti compared with preflight controls (P < 0.001). There was a concomittant reduction in stroke volume, to the extent that it was no longer significantly different from preflight control. Diffusing capacity remained elevated (11%; P < 0.05) late in flight. These findings suggest that, despite increased pulmonary perfusion and pulmonary capillary blood volume, interstitial pulmonary edema does not result from exposure to microG.",Excluded

This is a retrospective, observational, single-center trial analyzing 77 consecutive patients with recurrent BM who were treated primarily with WBRT. All patients underwent SRS as salvage treatment. Median age was 62 years, and median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) was 80. The median interval between the starting date of WBRT and radiosurgery was 10.6 months. One, two and more than two SRS sessions were required in 42, 13 and 22 patients, respectively. The median total planning target volume (PTV) was 8.1 mL and the median dose prescribed was 20 Gy. The median follow-up was 7.7 months. 1- and 2-year neurological death-free survival (NS) rates were 87 and 78 %, respectively.

4682,"Effects of background illumination on the horizontal cell responses in the tiger salamander retina Synaptic transmission between photoreceptors and horizontal cells (HCs) was studied in the flat-mounted isolated retinas of the tiger salamander. Background illumination expedited the rise time of the HC light response, and the HC response rise time (HCRRT) reached steady state about 2 sec after the onset of the background illumination. The change in HCRRT is probably responsible for the background-induced enhancement of the HC responses to short light stimuli. The amplitude of the HC responses to 100 msec light steps in the presence of background illumination was 2-5 times larger than that measured under dark-adapted conditions. Background illumination exerted little effect on the response rise time in cones and bipolar cells, and thus it caused no significant response enhancement in those cells. The background-induced change in HCRRT correlated closely with the rod voltage but not with the HC voltage. These results suggest that the background-induced change in HCRRT is probably mediated by postsynaptic events in HCs because no significant time course change is observed in photoreceptors and bipolar cells (which share the same synapses with the HCs). A suppressive rod action on the cone inputs in HCs may be responsible for modulating the HCRRT. By shortening the HCRRT, background illumination regulates the frequency response of the photoreceptor-HC synapse and alters the capacity of spatial resolution of retinal bipolar cells.",Excluded

We report mature outcomes for a cohort of patients with no prior radiation (de novo) treated with 24 Gy in 2 daily fractions, which represents an emerging Canadian standard. Purpose/Objective(s): The cohort consisted of 279 de novo spinal metastases in 145 consecutive patients treated with 24 Gy in 2 SBRT fractions, between 2009 and 2015, identified from a prospective database. All vertebral segments were treated with an institutionally standardized Linac-based approach using cone-beam CT image guidance and six degrees-of-freedom online setup correction. The endpoints were overall survival (OS), local control (LC), and the rate of vertebral compression fractures (VCF). OS rates were obtained using Kaplan-Meier methods and cumulative incidences of LC and VCF were obtained from competing risk analysis using death as a competing risk event. Evaluation of tumor control was based on serial spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as per the SPIne response assessment in Neuro-Oncology (SPINO) criteria recommendations. Result(s): The median follow-up was 17.0 months (range, 0.1-71.6 months). The 1-year and 2-year OS rates were 73.1% and 60.7%, respectively. Presence of epidural disease (P < 0.0001), lung (P = 0.0415) and renal cell (P < 0.0001) primary histologies and diffuse spinal metastatic disease as opposed to oligometastatic disease (P = 0.0034) were significant prognostic factors. The 1-year and 2-year LC rates were 90.3% and 82.4%, respectively, and the median time to local failure (LF) was 9.2 month (range, 0.4-31.3 months). Only the presence of epidural disease predicted for LF (P < 0.0001). The cumulative risk of VCF at 1 and 2 years were 8.5% and 13.8%, respectively. Lytic (P = 0.0143) or mixed lytic/blastic (P = 0.0214) lesions, spinal misalignment (P = 0.0121), and the dose to 90% of the planning target volume (PTVD90) (P = 0.0085) were significant predictors of VCF. Conclusion(s): Twenty-four Gy in 2 daily fractions is safe and effective in achieving high tumor control rates for de novo spinal metastases.

The female rats were randomly divided into four groups. Group I; exposed to 3G modulated 2100MHz RFR signal for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 2 weeks, group II; control 10 days, were kept in an inactive exposure set-up for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 2 weeks, group III; exposed to 3G modulated 2100MHz RFR signal for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 8 weeks and group IV; control 40 days, were kept in an inactive exposure set-up for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 8 weeks. After the genomic DNA content of brain was extracted, oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine, pg/mL) and malondialdehyde (MDA, nmoL/g tissue) levels were determined. Our main finding was the increased oxidative DNA damage to brain after 10 days of exposure with the decreased oxidative DNA damage following 40 days of exposure compared to their control groups. Besides decreased lipid peroxidation end product, MDA, was observed after 40 days of exposure. The measured decreased quantities of damage during the 40 days of exposure could be the means of adapted and increased DNA repair mechanisms.",Excluded
4465,"Role of short TE 1H-MR spectroscopy in monitoring of post-operation irradiated patients Post-surgical radiation therapy is a routine procedure in the treatment of primary malignant brain tumors. Along with modest therapeutic effects conventional fractionated radiotherapy, in spite of any modifications, produces damage to non-malignant brain tissues lying within the treatment volume, the extent of which depends on radiation dose. Serial 1H-MRS allows non-invasive investigation of tissue metabolic profiles. In the present study the ratios of resonance signals assigned to the major 1H-MRS-visible metabolites (N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine, inositol, lactate and lipid methylene group) were evaluated before, during and after post-surgical fractionated radiotherapy in brain regions close to and more distant from the tumor bed, receiving different radiation exposures (60 and < 40 Gy, respectively). The study group consisted of ten patients (aged 28-51). A MRI/MRS system (Elscint 2T Prestige) operating at the field strength of 2 T and the proton resonance frequency of 81.3 MHz has been used and the 1H-MR spectra were acquired using single voxel double-spin-echo PRESS sequence with a short TE. The spectra were post-processed with automatic fitting in the frequency domain. It was found that although the metabolite profiles depend on the dose obtained, but other stress factors (like surgery) seem to contribute to the overall picture of the metabolic status of the brain as well. In studies of early irradiation injuries, an increase of choline related ratios may serve rather as cell proliferation indictors than as cell injury ones, whereas the mI/Cr ratio appears as one of the first indicators of local irradiation injury. In order to establish the prognostic marker for early radiation damage, however, it seems necessary to analyze all visible metabolites as well. None of the metabolites separately may serve as such an indicator due to the complexity of tissue metabolism. Interestingly, MRI reveals no changes during the therapy process, whereas the metabolite ratios are being affected in the course of time, thus supporting the presumption that the 1H-MRS is a valuable method of radiation therapy monitoring.",Excluded
4190,"Effects of low intensity radiofrequency electromagnetic fields on electrical activity in rat hippocampal slices Slices of rat hippocampus were exposed to 700 MHz continuous wave radiofrequency (RF) fields (25.2-71.0 V m(-1), 5-15 min exposure) in a stripline waveguide. At low field intensities, the predominant effect on the electrically evoked field potential in CA1 was a potentiation of the amplitude of the population spike by up to 20%, but higher intensity fields could produce either increases or decreases of up to 120 and 80%, respectively, in the amplitude of the population spike. To eliminate the possibility of RF-induced artefacts due to the metal stimulating electrode, the effect of RF exposure on spontaneous epileptiform activity induced in CA3 by 4-aminopyridine (50-100 microM) was investigated. Exposure to RF fields (50.0 V m(-1)) reduced or abolished epileptiform bursting in 36% of slices tested. The maximum field intensity used in these experiments, 71.0 V m(-1), was calculated to produce a specific absorption rate (SAR) of between 0.0016 and 0.0044 W kg(-1) in the slices. Measurements with a Luxtron fibreoptic probe confirmed that there was no detectable temperature change (+/- 0.1 degrees C) during a 15 min exposure to this field intensity. Furthermore, imposed temperature changes of up to 1 degrees C failed to mimic the effects of RF exposure. These results suggest that low-intensity RF fields can modulate the excitability of hippocampal tissue in vitro in the absence of gross thermal effects. The changes in excitability may be consistent with reported behavioural effects of RF fields.",Excluded

3810,"Vascular targeting in photodynamic occlusion of subretinal vessels PURPOSE: To evaluate the potential of photodynamic therapy (PDT) using benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD) for occlusion of subretinal neovascular membranes, the authors studied efficiency and collateral damage of PDT-induced photothrombosis in the rabbit choriocapillary layer.METHOD: Benzoporphyrin derivative, a new photosensitizer, currently in clinical trials for tumor therapy, was used. Low-density lipoprotein served as a carrier to enhance selective targeting of vascular endothelial cells.RESULTS: Complete choriocapillary occlusion was achieved at a BPD dose of 2 mg/kg and a radiant exposure as low as 10 J/cm2. When PDT was performed 3 hours after BPD application, damage to the neural retina was minimal. Only inner photoreceptor segments showed mitochondrial swelling probably secondary to choroidal ischemia. Bruch's membrane remained intact. Retinal pigment epithelium was invariably damaged as seen with other photosensitizers.CONCLUSION: Compared with photocoagulation BPD-PDT allows endothelial-bound intraluminal photothrombosis, sparing important structures such as neural retina and Bruch's membrane. It may thus provide a more selective treatment of juxtafoveal and subfoveal neovascular membranes.",Excluded
4650,"Robust/optimal temperature profile control of a high-speed aerospace vehicle using neural networks An approximate dynamic programming (ADP)-based suboptimal neurocontroller to obtain desired temperature for a high-speed aerospace vehicle is synthesized in this paper. A 1-D distributed parameter model of a fin is developed from basic thermal physics principles. ""Snapshot"" solutions of the dynamics are generated with a simple dynamic inversion-based feedback controller. Empirical basis functions are designed using the ""proper orthogonal decomposition"" (POD) technique and the snapshot solutions. A low-order nonlinear lumped parameter system to characterize the infinite dimensional system is obtained by carrying out a Galerkin projection. An ADP-based neurocontroller with a dual heuristic programming (DHP) formulation is obtained with a single-network-adaptive-critic (SNAC) controller for this approximate nonlinear model. Actual control in the original domain is calculated with the same POD basis functions through a reverse mapping. Further contribution of this paper includes development of an online robust neurocontroller to account for unmodeled dynamics and parametric uncertainties inherent in such a complex dynamic system. A neural network (NN) weight update rule that guarantees boundedness of the weights and relaxes the need for persistence of excitation (PE) condition is presented. Simulation studies show that in a fairly extensive but compact domain, any desired temperature profile can be achieved starting from any initial temperature profile. Therefore, the ADP and NN-based controllers appear to have the potential to become controller synthesis tools for nonlinear distributed parameter systems.",Excluded
4394,"Quantitative and qualitative intrapatient comparison of 68Ga-DOTATOC and 68Ga-DOTATATE: net uptake rate for accurate quantification UNLABELLED: Quantitative imaging and dosimetry are crucial for individualized treatment during peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). (177)Lu-DOTATATE and (68)Ga-DOTATOC/(68)Ga-DOTATATE are used, respectively, for PRRT and PET examinations targeting somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) in patients affected by neuroendocrine tumors. The aim of the study was to quantitatively and qualitatively compare the performance of (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE in the context of subsequent PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE under standardized conditions in the same patient as well as to investigate the sufficiency of standardized uptake value (SUV) for estimation of SSTR expression.METHODS: Ten patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors underwent one 45-min dynamic and 3 whole-body PET/CT examinations at 1, 2, and 3 h after injection with both tracers. The number of detected lesions, SUVs in lesions and normal tissue, total functional tumor volume, and SSTR volume (functional tumor volume multiplied by mean SUV) were investigated for each time point. Net uptake rate (Ki) was calculated according to the Patlak method for 3 tumors per patient.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in lesion count, lesion SUV, Ki, functional tumor volume, or SSTR volume between (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE at any time point. The detection rate was similar, although with differences for single lesions in occasional patients. For healthy organs, marginally higher uptake of (68)Ga-DOTATATE was observed in kidneys, bone marrow, and liver at 1 h. (68)Ga-DOTATOC uptake was higher in mediastinal blood pool at the 1-h time point (P = 0.018). The tumor-to-liver ratio was marginally higher for (68)Ga-DOTATOC at the 3-h time point (P = 0.037). Blood clearance was fast and similar for both tracers. SUV did not correlate with Ki linearly and achieved saturation for a Ki of greater than 0.2 mL/cm(3)/min, corresponding to an SUV of more than 25.CONCLUSION: (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE are suited equally well for staging and patient selection for PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE. However, the slight difference in the healthy organ distribution and excretion may render (68)Ga-DOTATATE preferable. SUV did not correlate linearly with Ki and thus may not reflect the SSTR density accurately at its higher values, whereas Ki might be the outcome measure of choice for quantification of SSTR density and assessment of treatment outcome.",Excluded

4083,"Crossed cerebellar diaschisis after stroke identified noninvasively with cerebral blood flow-weighted arterial spin labeling MRI BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) is most commonly investigated using hemodynamic PET and SPECT imaging. However, noninvasive MRI offers advantages of improved spatial resolution, allowing hemodynamic changes to be compared directly with structural findings and without concerns related to ionizing radiation exposure. The aim of this study was to evaluate relationships between CCD identified from cerebral blood flow (CBF)-weighted arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI with cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR)-weighted blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) MRI, Wallerian degeneration, clinical motor impairment, and corticospinal tract involvement.METHODS: Subjects (n=74) enrolled in an ongoing observational stroke trial underwent CBF-weighted ASL and hypercapnic CVR-weighted BOLD MRI. Hemispheric asymmetry indices for basal cerebellar CBF, cerebellar CVR, and cerebral peduncular area were compared between subjects with unilateral supratentorial infarcts (n=18) and control subjects without infarcts (n=16). CCD required (1) supratentorial infarct and (2) asymmetric cerebellar CBF (>95% confidence interval relative to controls).RESULTS: In CCD subjects (n=9), CVR (p=0.04) and cerebral peduncular area (p<0.01) were significantly asymmetric compared to controls. Compared to infarct subjects not meeting CCD criteria (n=9), CCD subjects had no difference in corticospinal tract location for infarct (p=1.0) or motor impairment (p=0.08).CONCLUSIONS: CCD correlated with cerebellar CVR asymmetry and Wallerian degeneration. These findings suggest that noninvasive MRI may be a useful alternative to PET or SPECT to study structural correlates and clinical consequences of CCD following supratentorial stroke.",Excluded
3757,"Fractionated ionizing radiation accelerates loss of amplified MDR1 genes harbored by extrachromosomal DNA in tumor cells In tumor specimens such as those from neuroblastoma, ovarian, and lung carcinoma patients, the prevalence of extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules harboring amplified genes has been well established. In some cases, the amplified genes have been identified as oncogenes, and their increased expression appears to contribute to the maintenance and progression of the malignancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fractionated radiation treatment, given in daily doses similar to those administered clinically, on the stability of extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules in cancer cells. Our studies were conducted with multidrug-resistant KB cells, which harbor extrachromosomal copies of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) almost exclusively on circular DNA molecules of approximately 750 and 1500 kb pairs. This size range is representative of extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules that have been shown to harbor amplified oncogenes in vivo. Exponentially growing MDR KB cells were exposed to 1400 and 2800 cGy ionizing radiation administered in 7 and 14 fractions, respectively, at 200 cGy per fraction/day. A statistically significant decrease in MDR1 extrachromosomal gene copy number was reproducibly detected in the irradiated cells compared with unirradiated cells passaged for the duration of the experiment in the absence of radiation treatment. This decrease was accompanied by a reduction in multidrug resistance and in P-glycoprotein levels, as determined by clonogenic dose-response assays and Western analyses, respectively. P-glycoprotein is a multidrug transporter encoded by the MDR1 gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies further determined that extrachromosomal circular DNA loss correlated to the entrapment of these DNA molecules in radiation-induced micronuclei. These results indicate that radiation-induced loss of extrachromosomally amplified genes from tumor cells via their entrapment in micronuclei contributes to the improved therapeutic response observed for some cancers.",Excluded

3946,"Spatial learning and memory deficits induced by exposure to iron-56-particle radiation It has previously been shown that exposing rats to particles of high energy and charge (HZE) disrupts the functioning of the dopaminergic system and behaviors mediated by this system, such as motor performance and an amphetamine-induced conditioned taste aversion; these adverse behavioral and neuronal effects are similar to those seen in aged animals. Because cognition declines with age, spatial learning and memory were assessed in the Morris water maze 1 month after whole-body irradiation with 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/nucleon high-energy (56)Fe particles, to test the cognitive behavioral consequences of radiation exposure. Irradiated rats demonstrated cognitive impairment compared to the control group as seen in their increased latencies to find the hidden platform, particularly on the reversal day when the platform was moved to the opposite quadrant. Also, the irradiated group used nonspatial strategies during the probe trials (swim with no platform), i.e. less time spent in the platform quadrant, fewer crossings of and less time spent in the previous platform location, and longer latencies to the previous platform location. These findings are similar to those seen in aged rats, suggesting that an increased release of reactive oxygen species may be responsible for the induction of radiation- and age-related cognitive deficits. If these decrements in behavior also occur in humans, they may impair the ability of astronauts to perform critical tasks during long-term space travel beyond the magnetosphere.",Included
4798,"Postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery for resected brain metastases: A comparison of outcomes for large resection cavities PURPOSE: Although historical trials have established the role of surgical resection followed by whole brain irradiation (WBRT) for brain metastases, WBRT has recently been shown to cause significant neurocognitive decline. Many practitioners have employed postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to tumor resection cavities to increase local control without causing significant neurocognitive sequelae. However, studies analyzing outcomes of large brain metastases treated with resection and postoperative SRS are lacking. Here we compare outcomes in patients with large brain metastases >4 cm to those with smaller metastases <=4 cm treated with surgical resection followed by SRS to the resection cavity.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Consecutive patients with brain metastases treated at our institution with surgical resection and postoperative SRS were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified into <=4 cm and >4 cm cohorts based on preoperative maximal tumor dimension. Cumulative incidence of local failure, radiation necrosis, and death were analyzed for the 2 cohorts using a competing-risk model, defined as the time from SRS treatment date to the measured event, death, or last follow-up.RESULTS: A total of 117 consecutive cases were identified. Of these patients, 90 (77%) had preoperative tumors <=4 cm, and 27 (23%) >4 cm in greatest dimension. The only significant baseline difference between the 2 groups was a higher proportion of patients who underwent gross total resection in the <=4 cm compared with the >4 cm cohort, 76% versus 48%, respectively (P <.01). The 1-year rates of local failure, radiation necrosis, and overall survival for the <=4 cm and >4 cm cohorts were 12.3% and 16.0%, 26.9% and 28.4%, and 80.6% and 67.6%, respectively (all P >.05). The rates of local failure and radiation necrosis were not statistically different on multivariable analysis based on tumor size.CONCLUSIONS: Brain metastases >4 cm in largest dimension managed by resection and radiosurgery to the tumor cavity have promising local control rates without a significant increase in radiation necrosis on our retrospective review.",Excluded
4146,"Unilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation has a measurable ipsilateral effect on rigidity and bradykinesia in Parkinson disease BACKGROUND: Bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) improves motor function in Parkinson disease (PD). However, little is known about the quantitative effects on motor behavior of unilateral STN DBS.METHODS: In 52 PD subjects with STN DBS, we quantified in a double-blinded manner rigidity (n=42), bradykinesia (n=38), and gait speed (n=45). Subjects were tested in four DBS conditions: both on, left on, right on and both off. A force transducer was used to measure rigidity across the elbow, and gyroscopes were used to measure angular velocity of hand rotations for bradykinesia. About half of the subjects were rated using the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (part III) motor scores for arm rigidity and repetitive hand rotation simultaneously during the kinematic measurements. Subjects were timed walking 25 feet.RESULTS: All subjects had significant improvement with bilateral STN DBS. Contralateral, ipsilateral and bilateral stimulation significantly reduced rigidity and bradykinesia. Bilateral stimulation improved rigidity more than unilateral stimulation of either side, but there was no significant difference between ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation. Although bilateral stimulation also increased hand rotation velocity more than unilateral stimulation of either side, contralateral stimulation increased hand rotation significantly more than ipsilateral stimulation. All stimulation conditions improved walking time but bilateral stimulation provided the greatest improvement.CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral STN DBS decreased rigidity and bradykinesia contralaterally as well ipsilaterally. As expected, bilateral DBS improved gait more than unilateral DBS.",Excluded
4672,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation in small-cell lung cancer Prophylactic cranial irradiation is now known to improve survival to a significant degree in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients; this is in addition to its established role in preventing the disabling symptoms of brain metastases. New information indicates that it confers a survival benefit for limited or extensive stage SCLC patients gaining a complete response in the chest. A review of causes of cerebral dysfunction as a complication indicates that such problems can be due to suboptimal radiation fractionation, chemotherapy, or an inappropriate combination of prophylactic brain irradiation with chemotherapy. Optimum treatment with prophylactic brain irradiation has been shown not to cause adverse effects with detailed psychometric testing. Several additional sources of information can be drawn together to suggest a dose-response pattern for prophylactic brain irradiation, leading to the recommendation that a dose of 25-36 Gy is optimal, delivered in 2-3 Gy daily fractions after the completion of chest irradiation and chemotherapy. This will be better defined in future clinical trials. [References: 32]",Excluded

Noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy plans consisted of 4 noncoplanar arcs and 2 full coplanar arcs, respectively. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy plans consisted of 7 coplanar fields. CyberKnife plans used skull tracking to ensure accurate position. All plans were generated to cover 95% target volume with prescription dose. Gradient index, conformity index, normal brain tissue volume (V <sub>3Gy</sub> - V <sub>24Gy</sub>), monitor units, and beam on time were evaluated.RESULTS: Gradient index was the lowest for CyberKnife (3.49 +/- 0.65), followed by noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (4.21 +/- 1.38), coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (4.87 +/- 1.35), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (5.36 +/- 1.98). Conformity index was the largest for noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (0.87 +/- 0.03), followed by coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (0.86 +/- 0.04), CyberKnife (0.86 +/- 0.07), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (0.85 +/- 0.05). Normal brain tissue volume at high-to-moderate dose spreads (V <sub>24Gy</sub> - V <sub>9Gy</sub>) was significantly reduced in noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy over that of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy. Normal brain tissue volume for noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy was comparable with noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy at high-dose level (V <sub>24Gy</sub> - V <sub>15Gy</sub>) and larger than CyberKnife at moderate-to-low dose level (V <sub>12Gy</sub> - V <sub>3Gy</sub>). Monitor units was highest for CyberKnife (28 733.59 +/- 7197.85), followed by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (4128.40 +/- 1185.38), noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (3105.20 +/- 371.23), and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (2997.27 +/- 446.84). Beam on time was longest for CyberKnife (30.25 +/- 7.32 minutes), followed by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (2.95 +/- 0.85 minutes), noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (2.61 +/- 0.07 minutes), and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (2.30 +/- 0.23 minutes).CONCLUSION: For brain metastases far away from organs-at-risk, noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy generated more rapid dose falloff and higher conformity compared to intensity-modulated radiation therapy and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy. Noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy provided a comparable dose falloff with CyberKnife at high-dose level and a slower dose falloff than CyberKnife at moderate-to-low dose level. Noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy plans had less monitor units and shorter beam on time than CyberKnife plans.",Excluded

Between June 1988 and December 2013, 238 patients undergoing intent-to-treat surgery for thymic epithelial tumors were reviewed. Sex, age, myasthenia gravis (MG), tumor histology, Masaoka staging, characteristic of locoregional invasion and recurrence, and the treatment for recurrence were collected. Comparison between groups was conducted using the Student t test and x2 test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors. One hundred sixteen of 135 patients with completely resected thymoma and 35 of 56 patients with thymic carcinoma remained free of recurrence. In patients with completely resected thymoma, Masaoka staging, MG, tumor invasion into the lung, pericardium, and innominate vein or superior vena cava (SVC) invasion were associated with recurrence-free survival in univariate analysis (P=0.004, 0.003, 0.001, 0.007, and 0.039, respectively). In multivariate analysis, MG was the positive independent prognosticator (P=0.039). In patients with completely resected thymic carcinoma, Masaoka staging and innominate vein or SVC invasion were associated with recurrence-free survival in univariate analysis (P=0.045 and 0.005, respectively), whereas innominate vein or SVC invasion was the negative independent prognosticator (P=0.012). In patients with recurrent thymoma, those treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy had a significantly better post-recurrence survival than those undergoing chemoradiotherapy (P=0.029) and those without treatment (P=0.007). Patients with recurrent thymic carcinoma undergoing surgery followed by chemotherapy had a significantly better post-recurrence survival than those without treatment (P=0.004), but not significantly better than those undergoing chemoradiotherapy (P=0.252). In patients with completely resected thymoma, MG was the positive independent prognosticators of recurrence-free survival. Surgery should be attempted for recurrent disease for better post-recurrence survival. In patients with completely resected thymic carcinoma, innominate vein or SVC invasion was the negative independent prognosticator. Surgery for recurrence could be considered since it provided benefit for postrecurrence survival as chemoradiotherapy did. Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4630,"Computerized tomography perfusion predictors of clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator Objective: Computerized Tomography Perfusion (CTP) is used to assess physiological brain tissue parameters in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Its utility for patients presenting within the 3 hrs time window is unknown and questionable given possible delay of thrombolytic administration and additional exposure to radiation. We addressed whether parameters on CTP for AIS patients treated with IV t-PA within 3 hrs of onset are predictive of good or bad outcome. Method(s): We retrospectively identified patients from our stroke registry (7/07 to 2/10) who presented with AIS and underwent CTP and then received tPA within 3 hrs of symptom onset. Patients that underwent intra-arterial therapy were excluded. A neuroradiologist blinded to outcome performed CTP measurements on a commercially available Siemens Neuro PCT workstation. Total perfusion deficit was defined as the area of infarct territory with a relative time to peak greater than 4s compared to the contralateral side (TTP). Nonviable tissue (NVT) was defined as the area of infarct territory with absolute cerebral blood volume (CBV) less than 2ml/100g. Penumbra was defined as the area of TTP minus the area of CBV. Good clinical outcome (GCO) was defined as mRS 0-2, and poor clinical outcome (PCO) was defined as mRS 5-6 at hospital discharge. Clinical perfusion mismatch (CPM) was defined as admit NIHSS >= 8 and NVT <=25cm<sup>2</sup>. Result(s): We identified 44 patients with a mean age of 68 years , median NIHSS on admission of 13 and median discharge mRS of 4. NVT was statistically different in those with poor outcome (Table 1) and a strong predictor of poor outcome when NVT was greater than 50 cm<sup>2</sup> (OR=6 , 95%CI: 1.05-34, p=0.044). TTP was statistically different in patients that achieved and did not achieve GCO (Table 1; OR=0.97, 95%CI: 0.95- 1, p=0.037). There was no statistical correlation between penumbra area, percentage penumbra, and CPM with GCO in univariate analysis. Younger age and lower admission NIHSS were associated with GCO and higher NIHSS was associated with PCO. Using multivariate logistic regression controlling for age and admission NIHSS, none of the CTP parameters were statistically associated with outcome measures. Conclusion(s): CTP parameters derived from commercially available software and published thresholds do not provide useful value beyond the NIHSS for predicting good outcome for AIS patients treated with IV tPA within 3 hours of onset but may be useful in predicting poor outcome if the area of non-viable tissue is greater than 50 cm<sup>2</sup>.

OBJECTIVES: Many neurosurgeons obtain repeat head CT at the first clinic follow-up visit for nonoperative cerebral contusion and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH). The authors undertook a single-center, retrospective study to determine whether outpatient CT altered clinical decision-making.METHODS: The authors evaluated 173 consecutive adult patients admitted to their institution from April 2006 to August 2012 with an admission diagnosis of cerebral contusion or tSAH and at least 1 clinic follow-up visit with CT. Patients with epidural, subdural, aneurysmal subarachnoid, or intraventricular hemorrhage, and those who underwent craniotomy, were excluded. Patient charts were reviewed for new CT findings, new patient symptoms, and changes in treatment plan. Patients were stratified by neurological symptoms into 3 groups: 1) asymptomatic; 2) mild, nonspecific symptoms; and 3) significant symptoms. Mild, nonspecific symptoms included minor headaches, vertigo, fatigue, and mild difficulties with concentration, short-term memory, or sleep; significant symptoms included moderate to severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, focal neurological complaints, impaired consciousness, or new cognitive impairment evident on routine clinical examination.RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three patients met inclusion criteria, with initial clinic follow-up obtained within approximately 6 weeks. Of the 173 patients, 104 (60.1%) were asymptomatic, 68 patients (39.3%) had mild, nonspecific neurological symptoms, and 1 patient (1.0%) had significant neurological symptoms. Of the asymptomatic patients, 3 patients (2.9%) had new CT findings and 1 of these patients (1.0%) underwent a change in treatment plan because of these findings. This change involved an additional clinic appointment and CT to monitor a 12-mm chronic subdural hematoma that ultimately resolved without treatment. Of the patients with mild, nonspecific neurological symptoms, 6 patients (8.8%) had new CT findings and 3 of these patients (4.4%) underwent a change in treatment plan because of these findings; none of these patients required surgical intervention. The single patient with significant neurological symptoms did not have any new CT findings.CONCLUSIONS: Repeat outpatient CT of asymptomatic patients after nonoperative cerebral contusion and tSAH is very unlikely to demonstrate significant new pathology. Given the cost and radiation exposure associated with CT, imaging should be reserved for patients with significant symptoms or focal findings on neurological examination.",Excluded

The phenotypes are similar to those of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) disease, where there is a deficiency in a protein kinase that is activated by DNA damage, indicating that the Nbs and Atm proteins may participate in common pathways. Here we report that Nbs is specifically phosphorylated in response to gamma-radiation, ultraviolet light and exposure to hydroxyurea. Phosphorylation of Nbs mediated by gamma-radiation, but not that induced by hydroxyurea or ultraviolet light, was markedly reduced in ATM cells. In vivo, Nbs was phosphorylated on many serine residues, of which S343, S397 and S615 were phosphorylated by Atm in vitro. At least two of these sites were underphosphorylated in ATM cells. Inactivation of these serines by mutation partially abrogated Atm-dependent phosphorylation. Reconstituting NBS cells with a mutant form of Nbs that cannot be phosphorylated at selected, ATM-dependent serine residues led to a specific reduction in clonogenic survival after gamma-radiation. Thus, phosphorylation of Nbs by Atm is critical for certain responses of human cells to DNA damage.",Excluded
4796,"Medical prevention and treatment of radiation-induced carotid injury Radiotherapy has significantly improved the survival of cancer patients but is also associated with several adversities, including radiation-induced carotid injury (RICI).

The main manifestation and adverse consequence of RICI is carotid artery stenosis (CAS), which can lead to stroke and transient ischemic attack. Currently, carotid artery injury is primarily diagnosed via color-coded duplex sonography. Early detection of traumatic changes in the carotid artery depends on measurements of carotid intima-media thickness; serum biomarker testing also shows great potential. CAS is mainly treated with carotid endarterectomy or carotid angioplasty and stent implantation.

4786,"A predictive model for distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumour progression after gamma knife radiosurgery based on radiomic features from MR images OBJECTIVES: To develop a model using radiomic features extracted from MR images to distinguish radiation necrosis from tumour progression in brain metastases after Gamma Knife radiosurgery.METHODS: We retrospectively identified 87 patients with pathologically confirmed necrosis (24 lesions) or progression (73 lesions) and calculated 285 radiomic features from four MR sequences (T1, T1 post-contrast, T2, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) obtained at two follow-up time points per lesion per patient. Reproducibility of each feature between the two time points was calculated within each group to identify a subset of features with distinct reproducible values between two groups. Changes in radiomic features from one time point to the next (delta radiomics) were used to build a model to classify necrosis and progression lesions.RESULTS: A combination of five radiomic features from both T1 post-contrast and T2 MR images were found to be useful in distinguishing necrosis from progression lesions. Delta radiomic features with a RUSBoost ensemble classifier had an overall predictive accuracy of 73.2% and an area under the curve value of 0.73 in leave-one-out cross-validation.CONCLUSIONS: Delta radiomic features extracted from MR images have potential for distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumour progression after radiosurgery for brain metastases.KEY POINTS: * Some radiomic features showed better reproducibility for progressive lesions than necrotic ones * Delta radiomic features can help to distinguish radiation necrosis from tumour progression * Delta radiomic features had better predictive value than did traditional radiomic features.",Excluded
3963,"Interactions between intraspinal Schwann cells and the cellular constituents normally occurring in the spinal cord: an ultrastructural study in the irradiated rat Relationships between intraspinal Schwann cells and neuroglia, particularly, astrocytes, were studied following X-irradiation of the spinal cord in 3-day-old rats. Initially, this exposure results in a depletion of the neuroglial population. By 10 days post-irradiation (P-I), gaps occur in the glia limitans, although the overlying basal lamina remains intact. Development of and myelination by intraspinal Schwann cells is well underway by 15 days P-I. These Schwann cell-occupied regions have a paucity of astrocyte processes, a finding which persists throughout the study (60 days P-I), and several types of Schwann cell-neuroglial interfaces are observed, including: (1) astrocyte separation of Schwann cells from oligodendrocyte-myelinated regions; (2) intermingling of Schwann cell-myelinated axons and oligodendrocyte-myelinated axons in the absence of astrocyte processes; and (3) ensheathment of unmyelinated axons by astrocyte processes which separate these axons from the Schwann cells. The gaps in the glia limitans widen as the P-I interval increases. At 45 and 60 days P-I, the basal lamina no longer forms a singular, continuous covering over the spinal cord surface, but follows instead a rather tortuous course over the disrupted glia limitans and the intraspinal Schwann cells. Although the mode of initial occurrence of Schwann cells within the spinal cord is not yet understood, the data indicate that the astrocyte population is involved in that process, as well as in limiting the further development of Schwann cells within the substance of the spinal cord.",Excluded
4116,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases after prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited disease small-cell lung cancer Background: Brain metastases are very common in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has been shown to reduce the incidence of brain metastases and to improve overall survival in patients with limited-disease SCLC (LD-SCLC). However, brain metastases are often observed after PCI, and the optimal treatment for these brain metastases is still unclear. The present study investigated the recurrence of brain metastases after PCI in patients with LD-SCLC and the therapeutic efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery for these metastases. Method(s): Between December 2000 and December 2012, 228 patients with LD-SCLC were treated and 98 of these patients with a complete response (CR) or a near CR to chemoradiotherapy underwent PCI at the National Cancer Center Hospital. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and imaging data for these 98 patients. Result(s): Twenty-four (24%) of the 98 patients developed brain metastases after PCI. The characteristics of the 24 patients were as follows: median age, 62 years (49-72 years), male/female, 21/3; performance status 0/1/2, 2/16/6. Twelve (50%) of the 24 patients had cranial recurrences only. Twelve patients had single brain metastases, and 12 patients had multiple lesions. Nine patients had neurological symptoms due to brain metastases. The median period after PCI until the appearance of the metastases was 9.9 months (1.1-34.9 months). Fifteen (63%) of the 24 patients underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (gamma knife radiosurgery [GKRS]), and one patient received whole brain radiotherapy. Six patients were treated with chemotherapy plus best supportive care (BSC), and two patients underwent BSC alone. The 15 patients who received GKRS had brain metastases with/without extracranial lesions (7 with, 8 without); three were symptomatic, and 12 were asymptomatic. The median number of brain metastases at the time of the first GKRS was one (range, 1-4). The local control rate of the lesions treated with GKRS was 86.7% (complete response in 3 patients, partial response in 7 patients, and stable disease in 3 patients). Five patients underwent further GKRS because of newly developing brain metastases (median: 4 times, range: 2-7 times). The median intracranial control time of the 15 patients was 6.8 months. The median survival time of the 15 patients was 29.3 months after the initial diagnosis, 13.7 months after the development of brain metastases, and 12.7 months after the treatment of GKRS. The median survival time of the patients without extracranial lesions was 20.2 months after the development of brain metastases and tended to be longer than that of the patients with extracranial lesions (12.6 months). Severe adverse events arising from GKRS were not observed in this series. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery may be an effective option as a salvage therapy for brain metastases after PCI in patients with LD-SCLC.",Excluded
4089,"The steroid hormone of sunlight soltriol (vitamin D) as a seasonal regulator of biological activities and photoperiodic rhythms Neural and systemic somatotrophic effects of the ultraviolet component of sunlight through the skin-vitamin D endocrine system are considered as alternate or additional to the neuroendocrine effects of the visual component of light through the retino-diencephalic input. The extensive distribution of soltriol nuclear receptor cells, revealed by autoradiography with tritium-labeled 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol (vitamin D, soltriol) and related effects, indicate an involvement of vitamin D-soltriol in the actinic induction of seasonal biorhythms. This is considered to be independent of the traditionally assigned effects of vitamin D on systemic calcium regulation. Skin-soltriol mediated seasonal, and to a degree daily, genomic activation involves many target regions in the brain. These include neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala, in the linked part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, in periventricular hypothalamic neurons, dorsal raphe nucleus, reticular thalamic nucleus and autonomic, endocrine as well as sensory and motor components of the brainstem and spinal cord. Additional to the eye-regulated ""suprachiasmatic clock"", existence of a soltriol-vitamin D regulated neural ""timing circuit(s)"" is proposed. Both, activational and organizational effects of soltriol on mature and developing brain regions, respectively are likely to play a role in the regulation of neuronal functions that include the modulation and entrainment of biorhythms. Soltriol's central effects correlate with peripheral effects on elements in skin, bone, teeth, kidney, intestine, heart and blood vessels, endocrine organs, and tissues of the immune and reproductive system.

3623,"Novel free-hand T1 pedicle screw method: Review of 44 consecutive cases SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Multilevel posterior cervical instrumented fusions are becoming more prevalent in current practice. Biomechanical characteristics of the cervicothoracic junction may necessitate extending the construct to upper thoracic segments. However, fixation in upper thoracic spine can be technically demanding owing to transitional anatomy while suboptimal placement facilitates vascular and neurologic complications. Thoracic instrumentation methods include free-hand, fluoroscopic guidance, and CT-based image guidance. However, fluoroscopy of upper thoracic spine is challenging secondary to vertebral geometry and patient positioning, while image-guided systems present substantial financial commitment and are not readily available at most centers. Additionally, imaging modalities increase radiation exposure to the patient and surgeon while potentially lengthening surgical time.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 44 consecutive patients undergoing a cervicothoracic fusion by a single surgeon using the novel free-hand T1 pedicle screw technique between June 2009 and November 2012. A starting point medial and cephalad to classic entry as well as new trajectory were utilized. No imaging modalities were employed during screw insertion. Postoperative CT scans were obtained on day 1. Screw accuracy was independently evaluated according to the Heary classification.RESULTS: In total, 87 pedicle screws placed were at T1. Grade 1 placement occurred in 72 (82.8%) screws, Grade 2 in 4 (4.6%) screws and Grade 3 in 9 (10.3%) screws. All Grade 2 and 3 breaches were <2 mm except one Grade 3 screw breaching 2-4 mm laterally. Only two screws (2.3%) were noted to be Grade 4, both breaching medially by less than 2 mm. No new neurological deficits or returns to operating room took place postoperatively.CONCLUSIONS: This modification of the traditional starting point and trajectory at T1 is safe and effective. It attenuates additional bone removal or imaging modalities while maintaining a high rate of successful screw placement compared to historical controls.",Excluded
3898,"PET/CT in the Evaluation of Neuroblastoma I-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is the most commonly used functional imaging agent in patients with neuroblastoma, but use of [F-18]- FDG PET is increasing. MIBG is useful for defining the extent of disease at diagnosis, following response to treatment, and localizing residual and recurrent disease. In early-stage disease, FDG is often better concentrated in tumor sites than MIBG. In all stages, disease extent in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and local metastases may be better delineated by FDG. In advanced-stage disease, MIBG is superior for following the treatment response of metastatic tumor in the marrow and bone. Several C-11- and F-18-labeled tracers may be equal to or superior to I-123-MIBG if supply problems can be resolved. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

These were also discussed in open session at the 16th International Leksell Gamma Knife Society Meeting in Sydney, Australia, in March 2012 and approved subject to certain revisions and the performance of an Internet vote for approval from the whole Society. This ballot was undertaken in September 2012.RESULTS: The recommendations in relation to volumes are that Gross Target Volume (GTV) should replace Target Volume (TV); Prescription Isodose Volume (PIV) should generally be used; the term Treated Target Volume (TTV) should replace TVPIV, GTV in PIV, and so forth; and the Volume of Accepted Tolerance Dose (VATD) should be used in place of irradiated volume. For dose prescription and measurement, the prescription dose should be supplemented by the Absorbed Dose, or DV% (for example, D95%), the maximum and minimum dose should be related to a specific tissue volume (for example, D2% or preferably D1 mm3), and the median dose (D50%) should be recorded routinely. The Integral Dose becomes the Total Absorbed Energy (TAE). In the assessment of planning quality, the use of the Target Coverage Ratio (TTV/ GTV), Paddick Conformity Index (PCI = TTV2/[GTV . PIV]), New Conformity Index (NCI = [GTV . PIV]/TTV2), Selectivity Index (TTV/PIV), Homogeneity Index (HI = [D2% -D98%]/D50%), and Gradient Index (GI = PIV0.5/PIV) are reemphasized. In relation to the dose to Organs at Risk (OARs), the emphasis is on dose volume recording of the VATD or the dose/volume limit (for example, V10) in most cases, with the additional use of a Maximum Dose to a small volume (such as 1 mm3) and/or a Point Dose and Mean Point Dose in certain circumstances, particularly when referring to serial organs. The recommendations were accepted by the International Leksell Gamma Knife Society by a vote of 92% to 8%.CONCLUSIONS: An agreed-upon and uniform terminology and subsequent standardization of certain methods and procedures will advance the clinical science of stereotactic radiosurgery.",Excluded

Therefore, every new technology or imaging tool introduced, such as three-dimensional rotational angiography (3D RA), should be evaluated in terms of radiation dose. 3D RA requires a series with a large number of images in comparison with 2D angiography and it is sometimes considered a high-dose IN procedure. The literature is scarce on the 3D RA radiation dose and in particular there are no data on carotid arteriography (CA). The aim of this study was to investigate patient dose differences between 2D and 3D CA.METHODS: The study included 35 patients undergoing 2D CA in hospital 1 and 25 patients undergoing 3D CA in hospital 2. Patient technical data collection included information on the kerma area product (KAP), fluoroscopy time (T), total number of series (S), and total number of acquired images (F).RESULTS: Median KAP was 112 Gy cm(2) and 41 Gy cm(2) for hospitals 1 and 2, respectively, median T was 8.2 min and 5.1 min, median S was 13 and 4, and median F was 247 and 242. Entrance surface air-kerma rate, as measured in ""medium"" fluoroscopy mode measured in 2D acquisition using a 20 cm phantom of polymethylmethacrylate, was 17.3 mGy/min for hospital 1 and 9.2 mGy/min for hospital 2.CONCLUSION: 3D CA allows a substantial reduction in patient radiation dose compared with 2D CA, while providing the necessary diagnostic information.",Excluded

METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database and identified 13 consecutive patients who underwent TR CAS from June 2019 through February 2020. Patients were divided into 2 groups: RA (6 patients) and manual (7 patients). RESULTS Among 6 patients in the RA group with a mean age of 70.0 +/- 7.2 years, technical success was achieved in all 6 (100%) procedures; there were no technical or access-site complications and no catheter exchanges. Transfemoral conversion was required in 1 (16.7%) case due to a tortuous aortic arch. There were no perioperative complications, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and mortality. The mean procedure duration was significantly longer in the RA group (85.0 +/- 14.3 minutes [95% CI 69.9-100.0] vs 61.2 +/- 17.5 minutes [95% CI 45.0-77.4], p = 0.0231). There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics, fluoroscopy time, contrast dose, radiation exposure, catheter exchanges, technical success, transfemoral conversion, technical or access-site complications, myocardial infarction, stroke, other complications, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS The authors' results suggest that RA TR CAS is feasible, safe, and effective. Neurovascular-specific engineering and software modifications are needed prior to complete remote control. Remote control has important implications regarding patient access to lifesaving procedures for conditions such as stroke and aneurysm rupture as well as operative precision.

4560,"Additional radiation exposure and fluoroscopy time in patients treated for tandem occlusions in the anterior circulation - A matched-pair analysis Background: Since radiation exposure in interventional radiology is of growing interest and the number of performed endovascular stroke treatments (EST), i. e. mechanical thrombectomy (MT)-is increasing, the demand of dose reference levels (DRL) is growing. This study was performed to quantify the additional radiation exposure (RE) and fluoroscopy time (FT) needed in patients treated for a tandem occlusion in the anterior circulation compared to patients without a preceding carotid artery occlusion or stenosis receiving EST. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained stroke database of a comprehensive stroke center focusing on the RE (as per dose area product in muGy*m2, median [IQR]), procedure and FT (in minutes, median [IQR]) in patients receiving carotid artery stenting (CAS) and MT in the anterior circulation ischemic stroke. Patients who received CAS and MT were matched with patients needing only MT according to number of thrombectomy maneuvers, location of intracranial occlusion, mode of anesthesia, gender and age (order of decreasing priority). Ergebnisse: Overall 236 patients (n = 118 in each group) have been included in this analysis. Additionally to matching criteria, there was no significant difference in patient's pre-morbid degree of disability (as per modified Rankin Scale), initial severity of stroke symptoms (as per National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale), and administration of i. v. rtPA or time from stroke onset to groin puncture in patients with known symptom onset. Procedure times (CAS+: 121 [80-176]; CAS-: 66 [45-106]), fluoroscopy times (CAS+: 57 [37-88]; CAS-: 3 2 [20-53]) as well as radiation exposure (CAS+: 19042 [13603-28722]; CAS-: 12379 [9307-18969]) were significantly higher in patients receiving CAS (all p-values: <0.0001). This is a relative median increase of radiation exposure of 53.8% and a relative increase of 78.2% of fluoroscopy time. Conclusion(s): As expected, patients treated for tandem occlusions receiving carotid artery stenting and intracranial mechanical thrombectomy have a massive increase of radiation exposure and fluoroscopy time compared to patients treated for intracranial large vessel occlusion only. This circumstance should be considered, when dose reference levels are compared.",Excluded
3770,"Relationship between histologic features and outcomes of carotid revascularization for radiation-induced stenosis OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate the relationships between preoperative carotid imaging results, histologic characteristics, and surgical treatment outcomes of radiation-induced carotid stenosis (RICS), using control subjects without RICS for comparison.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of 17 patients who underwent carotid revascularization for 22 instances of RICS, including 10 cases of carotid artery stenting (CAS), 11 cases of carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and 1 case of CEA with retrograde CAS, between July 2004 and April 2013. The controls were 475 patients with no history of radiation therapy who underwent carotid revascularization in a similar period. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (US), and computed tomography angiography results were correlated with outcomes of histologic analysis of CEA specimens. End points included ipsilateral and contralateral stroke, myocardial infarction, restenosis, in-stent thrombosis, and target lesion revascularization.RESULTS: Vulnerable plaques on carotid MRI (86% vs 64.2%; P = .010) and mobile (27% vs 8.0%; P = .008) and ulcerative (50% vs 15.8%; P < .001) plaques on US were more frequent in the RICS group. All revascularization procedures were successful, and no occlusion occurred. Adverse events in the CAS group, including one minor stroke and one transient ischemic attack within 30 days as well as five ipsilateral neurologic events after 30 days, including three minor strokes and two transient ischemic attacks, were significantly more frequent than in the CEA group. All three cases of late ipsilateral stroke displayed vulnerable plaque on preoperative MRI and late in-stent thrombosis or restenosis on US.CONCLUSIONS: Our radiologic and histologic analyses revealed that advanced RICS is often accompanied by formation of vulnerable plaque. CEA can prevent undesirable late outcomes in such cases.",Included

4286,"Magnetic resonance imaging. Its role in the neuroradiologic evaluation of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has rapidly become a major diagnostic technique, displacing computed tomography (CT) as the primary neuroimaging modality in many disorders of the central nervous system. Neuroimaging studies are valuable in the diagnosis and management of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome. This article reviews the technique of MRI and its role in identifying the characteristic central nervous system manifestations of these neurocutaneous syndromes.OBSERVATIONS: MRI offers superior soft-tissue contrast without the use of ionizing radiation. It provides more detailed imaging than CT of the characteristic central nervous system lesions of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome. In neurofibromatosis type 1, these include optic glioma, astrocytoma, and plexiform neurofibroma, and ""unidentified bright objects"" that are seen only with MRI. Bilateral acoustic neuromas are the hallmark of neurofibromatosis type 2. Subependymal nodules and cortical and white matter tubers are characteristic of tuberous sclerosis. Manifestations of Sturge-Weber syndrome include leptomeningeal angiomatosis, hemiatrophy, cortical calcification, and patchy parenchymal gliosis and demyelination.CONCLUSIONS: MRI, especially with gadolinium enhancement, appears to be more sensitive than CT in the detection of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome.

The data from randomized trials document that PCI reduces brain metastases rate from approximately 60% to 30%, and increases 3-year overall survival by approximately 5%. Currently, the dose of 25 Gy in 10 fractions is considered as standard. In attempt to reduce neuropsychological sequelae attributable to PCI hippocampal sparing techniques are employed. The existing studies suggest the benefit of hippocampal sparing in limiting memory and higher neurocognitive function losses, but with a risk of failures in the spared region. Ongoing studies will further validate the role of hippocampal sparing, both in terms of toxicity reduction and metastases prevention. PCI for patients who have undergone resection for stage I small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is not recommended, PCI may be, however, associated with a favourable outcome in SCLC patients who have undergone complete surgery in stages II-III. The role of PCI in extensive-disease (ED) SCLC has been evolving. Most recent evidence indicate that PCI is controversial in ED patients with response to initial chemotherapy and absence of brain metastases confirmed by contrast-enhanced MRI. The patients who do not receive PCI, must, however, receive periodic MRI examination during follow-up, i.e., remain under active surveillance with access to radiotherapy at brain relapse. The assessment of safety and effectiveness of hippocampal-sparing PCI, with or without drug neuroprotection in consideration of diverse combinations of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy create a background for future directions of research.

4746,"The PET Radioligand 18F-FIMX Images and Quantifies Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 1 in Proportion to the Regional Density of Its Gene Transcript in Human Brain UNLABELLED: A recent study from our laboratory found that (18)F-FIMX is an excellent PET radioligand for quantifying metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) in monkey brain. This study evaluated the ability of (18)F-FIMX to quantify mGluR1 in humans. A second goal was to use the relative density of mGluR1 gene transcripts in brain regions to estimate specific uptake and nondisplaceable uptake (VND) in each brain region.METHODS: After injection of 189 +/- 3 MBq of (18)F-FIMX, 12 healthy volunteers underwent a dynamic PET scan over 120 min. For 6 volunteers, images were acquired until 210 min. A metabolite-corrected arterial input function was measured from the radial artery. Four other subjects underwent whole-body scanning to estimate radiation exposure.RESULTS: (18)F-FIMX uptake into the human brain was high (SUV = 4-6 in the cerebellum), peaked at about 10 min, and washed out rapidly. An unconstrained 2-tissue-compartment model fitted the data well, and distribution volume (VT) (mLcm(-3)) values ranged from 1.5 in the caudate to 11 in the cerebellum. A 120-min scan provided stable VT values in all regions except the cerebellum, for which an acquisition time of at least 170 min was necessary. VT values in brain regions correlated well with mGluR1 transcript density, and the correlation suggested that VND of (18)F-FIMX was quite low (0.5 mLcm(-3)). This measure of VND in humans was similar to that from a receptor blocking study in monkeys, after correcting for differences in plasma protein binding. Similar to other (18)F-labeled ligands, the effective dose was about 23 muSv/MBq.CONCLUSION: (18)F-FIMX can quantify mGluR1 in the human brain with a 120- to 170-min scan. Correlation of brain uptake with the relative density of mGluR1 transcript allows specific receptor binding of a radioligand to be quantified without injecting pharmacologic doses of a blocking agent.",Excluded

4681,"Non-linear, high-gain and sustained-to-transient signal transmission from rods to amacrine cells in dark-adapted retina of Ambystoma In darkness, On-Off amacrine cells (ACs) of the tiger salamander retina exhibited large spontaneous transient depolarizing potentials (sTDPs) with average peak amplitude of 5.05 +/- 2.5 mV and average frequency of 0.42 +/- 0.25 s(-1). Under voltage-clamp conditions the cell displayed large spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) with average peak amplitude of 98 +/- 39 pA and average frequency of 0.45 +/- 0.22 s(-1). To a light step, ACs gave rise to a transient 'On' response at the light onset and a transient 'Off' response at light offset, followed by a train of TDPs ('After' response). Near the response threshold (0.3 activated rhodopsin molecules per rod per second), light-evoked TDPs (leTDPs) of similar amplitude and kinetics as the large sTDPs observed in darkness were seen, and about half of these leTDPs elicited a regenerative potential (RP). Brighter light steps gave rise to more leTDPs and higher rates of RPs in the On, Off and After responses. Within the linear response range of the rods, the AC response was non-linear, with the highest gain (676 +/- 429) near the dark potential. The amplitude of Off responses increased with the duration of the light step, and ACs may use this to encode speeds of moving stimuli: the faster the light object moves, the smaller the AC Off response. Moreover, the number of leTDPs in the AC After response increased with light intensity, and the onset of the After response coincides with bipolar cell tail response recovery. One possible origin of the large sTDPs and leTDPs is the spontaneous and depolarization-induced regenerative calcium potentials (RCaPs) in bipolar cell synaptic terminals. RCaPs in bipolar cell synaptic terminals cause transient glutamate release that results in the sTDPs in darkness, and leTDPs in On, Off and After responses in ACs.",Excluded

On univariate analysis T1 tumor (p=.012), concomittant chemoradiotherapy (p=.023), start of radiotherapy within the 3 months after diagnosis (p=.026) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (p=.025) significantly improved disease free survival rate. Concomittant chemoradiotherapy (p<.001), early radiotherapy (p<.001) and prophylactic cranial irradiaton (p=.001) significantly affected overall survival rate. On multivariate analysis, only prophylactic cranial irradiation was found to be an independent factor affecting overall survival rate (p=.003). CONCLUSION Our results were consistent with the literature even though small sample size. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was determined the only independent factor that affects overall survival.

4327,"Skin injuries caused by fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures: case-based review and self-assessment module OBJECTIVE: Fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures are performed in cardiology, and complex interventions are performed in cerebral as well as peripheral circulation. These procedures sometimes deliver a high radiation dose to the patient's skin and can cause serious skin injuries.CONCLUSION: Interventionalists are often unaware of the high radiation doses to which a patient's skin may be subjected. Most are unaware that such injuries can occur even with the use of modern equipment. Therefore, they and other physicians, including dermatologists, often do not recognize such skin injuries as being related to an interventional procedure. [References: 23]",Excluded
3944,"Some neurotropic effects of low-intensity electromagnetic waves in rats with different typological characteristics of higher nervous activity The effects of low-intensity electromagnetic waves (4200 MHz, modulated with quasichaotic signals at 20-20000 Hz, energy density 15 muW/cm<sup>2</sup>; specific energy absorption not greater than 15 mJ/kg) on the neurochemical systems of the brain and on behavioral reactions were studied in experimental animals with different typological characteristics of higher nervous activity. These studies showed that electromagnetic waves produced marked changes in the state and activity of the monoaminergic mediator systems which were in general terms concordant with changes at the integrative level (mostly selective inhibitory effects). The nature of these processes depended to a significant extent on the typological characteristics of the animals.",Excluded
3640,"Selective chest imaging for blunt trauma patients: The national emergency X-ray utilization studies (NEXUS-chest algorithm) Chest imaging plays a prominent role in blunt trauma patient evaluation, but indiscriminate imaging is expensive, may delay care, and unnecessarily exposes patients to potentially harmful ionizing radiation. To improve diagnostic chest imaging utilization, we conducted 3 prospective multicenter studies over 12years to derive and validate decision instruments (DIs) to guide the use of chest x-ray (CXR) and chest computed tomography (CT). The first DI, NEXUS Chest x-ray, consists of seven criteria (Age >60years; rapid deceleration mechanism; chest pain; intoxication; altered mental status; distracting painful injury; and chest wall tenderness) and exhibits a sensitivity of 99.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 98.2-99.4%) and a specificity of 13.3% (95% CI, 12.6%-14.0%) for detecting clinically significant injuries. We developed two NEXUS Chest CT DIs, which are both highly reliable in detecting clinically major injuries (sensitivity of 99.2%; 95% CI 95.4-100%). Designed primarily to focus on detecting major injuries, the NEXUS Chest CT-Major DI consists of six criteria (abnormal CXR; distracting injury; chest wall tenderness; sternal tenderness; thoracic spine tenderness; and scapular tenderness) and exhibits higher specificity (37.9%; 95% CI 35.8-40.1%). Designed to reliability detect both major and minor injuries (sensitivity 95.4%; 95% CI 93.6-96.9%) with resulting lower specificity (25.5%; 95% CI 23.5-27.5%), the NEXUS CT-All rule consists of seven elements (the six NEXUS CT-Major criteria plus rapid deceleration mechanism). The purpose of this review is to synthesize the three DIs into a novel, cohesive summary algorithm with practical implementation recommendations to guide selective chest imaging in adult blunt trauma patients.",Excluded
4547,"Assessment of pain during head and neck irradiation Radiation therapy for patients with head and neck malignancies frequently results in painful mucositis, which is usually poorly controlled with standard analgesics or topical anesthetics. To better understand the temporal development of radiation-induced pain and the effects of this pain on activities of daily living, 14 patients undergoing radiation therapy for a newly diagnosed head and neck malignancy completed daily pain diaries during the course of irradiation. All patients developed painful mucositis, usually beginning during the second or third week of radiation. Despite the use of analgesics/anesthetics, pain was rated as moderate or severe on 37% of treatment days and was noted to be constant or present throughout most of the day on 58% of treatment days. Eating and sleep disturbances related to pain occurred on 55% and 34% of treatment days, respectively. Eight patients had greater than a 2-kg weight loss. Radiation induces a predictable pattern of pain and comorbidity, which may be amenable to earlier and more aggressive analgesic treatment.",Excluded

4225,"Diagnostic accuracy of whole-brain computed tomographic perfusion imaging in small-volume infarctions PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to determine the diagnostic accuracy of whole-brain computed tomographic perfusion (WB-CTP) in small ischemic brain infarctions and to identify factors influencing the detection rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Out of a retrospective cohort of 1380 subjects who underwent initial WB-CTP because of suspected stroke, we selected all patients with a supratentorial magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed ischemic infarction with a volume of 8 mL or less. Infratentorial lesions were excluded. The study was designed as a case-control study with a ratio of cases to controls with no infarction in follow-up magnetic resonance imaging of 1:3. Two blinded readers independently evaluated 4 different computed tomographic perfusion parameter data sets per subject with respect to the presence and localization of a perfusion deficit. RESULT(S): A total of 113 subjects met the inclusion criteria for the patient group. Overall, WB-CTP reached a sensitivity of 43.4% and a specificity of 92.9%. Among these, cortical infarctions were detected in 31 (69%) of 49 cases, whereas subcortical infarctions were detected only in 18 (28%) of 64 cases (P < 0.05). Mean final infarction diameter (17.3 mm) and volume (1.9 mL) of infarctions detected on CTP were significantly larger than those of infarctions not detected (12.4 mm and 0.8 mL, respectively; P < 0.001). Time from symptom onset did not differ significantly between infarctions that were detected or those that were not (204 vs 189 minutes; P = 0.75). CONCLUSION(S): The detection rate of WB-CTP in small infarctions highly depends on infarction localization and final size, whereas time from symptom onset does not seem to influence diagnostic accuracy.

4426,"Arterial Spin-Labeling Perfusion MR Imaging Demonstrates Regional CBF Decrease in Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Regional cerebral blood flow has previously been studied in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus with imaging methods that require an intravenous contrast agent or expose the patient to ionizing radiation. The purpose of this study was to assess regional CBF in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus compared with healthy controls using the noninvasive quantitative arterial spin-labeling MR imaging technique. A secondary aim was to compare the correlation between symptom severity and CBF.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Differences in regional cerebral perfusion between patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and healthy controls were investigated with pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling perfusion MR imaging. Twenty-one consecutive patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and 21 age- and sex-matched randomly selected healthy controls from the population registry were prospectively included. The controls did not differ from patients with respect to selected vascular risk factors. Twelve different anatomic ROIs were manually drawn on coregistered FLAIR images. The Holm-Bonferroni correction was applied to statistical analyses.RESULTS: In patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, perfusion was reduced in the periventricular white matter (P < .001), lentiform nucleus (P < .001), and thalamus (P < .001) compared with controls. Cognitive function in patients correlated with CBF in the periventricular white matter (r = 0.60, P < .01), cerebellum (r = 0.63, P < .01), and pons (r = 0.71, P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: Using pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling, we could confirm findings of a reduced perfusion in the periventricular white matter, basal ganglia, and thalamus in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus previously observed with other imaging techniques.",Excluded
3969,"Pericardial effusion and cardiac hypokinesis associated with longstanding, multi-organ system sarcoidosis Introduction: Sarcoidosis is a multi-organ system granulomatous disorder. Pericardial effusions associated with sarcoidosis are uncommon (19% of cases.) Case Report: A 54-year-old lady was diagnosed with sarcoidosis as a result of a breast biopsy in 2014 that revealed non-caseating granulomas. Since then, the patient has had chronic persistent dyspnea. Also, she has had involvement of cardiac muscle, her neurological system (unable to raise the left arm), spleen, lungs (stage 2, bilateral hilar adenopathy with infiltrates), and bony involvement of hands (arthritis and clubbing.) Often, patients with stage 2 sarcoidosis tend to go into remission spontaneously (40-70%.) In our patient's case, none of her multi-organ system manifestations abated. Up until this point, her lifelong condition has never been treated despite her symptoms because she refused corticosteroids. Superimposed on this patient were additional inflammatory diagnoses: Grave's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, treated lyme disease, second degree heart block, spinal meningitis, tick-borne alpha 1,3 galactose allergy. When we met the patient our focus was patient-centered education. We convinced our patient to accept steroid treatment because PET-MRI imaging may now detect scar vs. inflamed, viable tissue in her ventricle with enhanced sensitivity. Discussion(s): Newer-generation PET-MRI scans have ability to differentiate scar vs. inflammatory muscle with enhanced sensitivity. This improves clinical decision-making. Only 40-50% patients with cardiac sarcoidosis are diagnosed during their lifetime. To avert missed diagnoses, the advent of improved PET-MRI allows us to detect and treat cardiac sarcoidosis. It is incumbent to treat, because, if left untreated, the risk of sudden death from cardiac sarcoidosis is as high as 85%. Recent developments in PET technology reduce radiation dose. In our patient's situation, her decision to finally initiate therapy at age 54 was based on a patient-centered, empathic, compassionate explanation of the multi-system organ nature of her disease and the advantageous properties of PET-MRI to detect a treatable cause of dyspnea.",Excluded
4770,"Survival benefit of anti-HER2 therapy after whole-brain radiotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer patients with brain metastasis AIM: We aimed to assess the survival benefit of epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer patients with brain metastasis (BM) after whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in combination with systemic treatments, especially anti-HER2 therapy.METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed the overall survival (OS) of 60 HER2-positive breast cancer patients with BM after WBRT in combination with systemic treatments. Among them, 42 patients received chemotherapy while 18 patients did not receive after WBRT. With regard to anti-HER2 therapy, after WBRT, 17 patients received anti-HER2 treatment without prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy, 7 patients received anti-HER2 treatment with prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy, and 36 patients did not receive further anti-HER2 treatment. All patients were followed up regularly until January 23, 2013.RESULTS: The median OS of patients with BM was 12 months. Patients who received anti-HER2 therapy and chemotherapy after WBRT had significantly better survival compared with patients who did not receive further treatment. Patients who received anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT but did not receive adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy for early breast cancer had better OS, followed by patients who received anti-HER2 agent both in adjuvant treatment and after WBRT and patients who did not receive anti-HER2 treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that Karnofsky Performance Status, control of extracranial metastases, chemotherapy after WBRT, and anti-HER2 therapy combined with WBRT were all independent predictors for OS.CONCLUSION: Both chemotherapy and anti-HER2 therapy after WBRT could improve OS. Moreover, patients without prior exposure to adjuvant anti-HER2 treatment may have survival benefit superior to those of patients with prior exposure.",Excluded
4634,"Irradiation of 850-nm laser light changes the neural activities in rat primary visual cortex Although infrared laser was proven to be an alternative approach for neural stimulation, there is very little known about the neural response to infrared laser irradiation in visual cortex. This study is to investigate the effect of near-infrared laser irradiation on neural activities at the cortex level. A 850-nm pigtailed diode laser was applied to stimulate the rat primary visual cortex while the horizontal black and white stripe pattern was used as standard visual stimulation to evoke visual-evoked potential (VEP). Both amplitude and latency of VEP P100 was measured with or without infrared pulse stimulation applied in rat primary visual cortex. Paired t test and one-way analysis of variance were used to evaluate the impact of infrared irradiation and its pulse width on the amplitudes and latencies of P100, respectively. The results from our preliminary study revealed that, the pulsed near-infrared laser depressed the VEP amplitude and shortened the latency of P100; with the increment of pulse width of infrared irradiation, further decline of VEP amplitude and much shortened latency of P100 were observed. The present work suggests that near-infrared laser irradiation can alter the neural activities in primary visual cortex transiently, and could provide a novel contactless artificial neural stimulus to brain cortex with high spatial selectivity.",Excluded
3970,"Achieving sub cm CTV-PTV margin in pelvic treatments: Radiographers learning curve Aims: Image guidance is not always feasible or available for standard/ conformal treatments and so, offline portal image measurements help define population based CTV-PTV margins. Reproducibility in pelvis is aided by the use of ankle- and/or knee-indexed supports available in standard sizes generally suiting the needs of taller western patients. Radiographers need to be convinced of the importance for use of one/more positional devices as this adds to setup effort and time. Different permutations of aligning the pelvis and positional aids, resident supervised or not are reported for patients treated for cancer of the cervix/endometrium. Method(s): Patients were aligned using lasers/field lights to either anterior field center (conventional alignment) or to mid line tattoo over mons pubis keeping constant 10 cm table top to vertical height for all setups using either standard ankle or knee plus ankle positioning device. Localization CT scanbased digitally reconstructed radiographs were used as reference to compare with portal imaging acquired generally in pattern of 3 in 1st week and weekly thereafter. The van Herk formula was used to compute CTV-PTV margin from anterior and lateral image projections to give mediolateral (ML), cranio-caudal (CC) and antero-posterior (AP) margins. Result(s): The initial pelvic alignment were done in the presence of a resident doctor using ankle positioning by two different alignment methods: conventional and setup (4 cm cranial offset from reference tattoo at mons pubis). The corresponding PTV margin in ML direction was 1.6 cm versus 0.9 cm, CC 1.2 cm versus 1.1 cm respectively and in AP was identical at 0.7 cm. Subsequently, with radiographers by themselves, PTV margins were 1.1 cm versus 0.9 cm for ML, 1.1 cm versus 1.5 cm, CC and 1.0 cm versus 0.9 cm in AP direction for conventional and setup alignment respectively. An increase in CC margin was seen for setup arm. The radiographers were given feedback and setup reproducibility was assessed for next 13 patients treated with a similar setup protocol. The PTV margins for this group in CC showed improvement to 1.1 cm, ML was 0.9 cm and 0.9 cm in AP directions. A knee-positioning device was introduced with ankle for patient alignment with setup protocol. An increase in PTV margin to 1.4 cm was calculated for ML with modest decrease in CC at 0.8 cm and 0.9 cm for AP direction with use of two devices. The standard knee device was abandoned as use of two devices was perceived as cumbersome and unsuitable in height for patients. A third technique of alignment keeping treatment center at tattooed reference plane (mons pubis) using ankle device was studied. The PTV margins for ML, CC, AP directions were within a cm-0.8 cm, 0.9 cm, 0.9 cm respectively which is now the current practice. Conclusion(s): There is a radiographer learning curve. Changes in treatment practice spurring from new technologies require continuing education and feedback for radiographers to improvise their skills in setup reproducibility to optimize set-up in the patient.",Excluded
4422,"Passive avoidance learning and memory of 56Fe sham-irradiated and irradiated human apoE transgenic mice Cranial irradiation is associated with long-term cognitive impairments, including deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Not all people exposed to cranial radiation develop cognitive injury, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. There may also be sex differences in susceptibility to develop radiation-induced cognitive injury. The three major human apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms are encoded by distinct alleles (epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4). Compared with epsilon3, epsilon4 increases the risk of cognitive impairments following various challenges while epsilon2 provides relative protection. Women are at higher risk to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men, particularly those carrying epsilon4. In previous experiments using male and female mice expressing human apoE-isoforms E2, E3 or E4 under the mouse apoE promoter, we showed that cranial irradiation with 137Cs (10 Gy) results in hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments that are sex- and apoE-isoform dependent. 137Cs is a form of irradiation often used in the clinical setting. To investigate whether 56Fe irradiation also has sex- and apoE-isoform dependent effects on hippocampus-dependent cognitive function in human apoE mice, we sham-irradiated and irradiated 2-month old male and female human apoE mice at 3 Gy and assessed their performance in a passive avoidance learning and memory test three to five months later.",Included
