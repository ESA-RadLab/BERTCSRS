3460,"[Radiation-induced neuropathies. Experimental and clinical data] In contrast with the central nervous system, the peripheral nerves are usually considered radioresistant. However, experimental and clinical data show evidence of peripheral nerve injury after radiation therapy. The physiopathology remains unclear. Vascular alterations appear to play an important role. Direct damage to axon or Schwann cell and nervous compression in areas of radiation fibrosis could also be involved. Clinically, brachial plexopathy is a well-recognized complication but all the structures of the peripheral nervous system can be involved: cranial nerves, roots, plexus and nerve trunks. A syndrome of early and reversible plexopathy differs from the classical progressive form with pejorative outcome. Radiation-induced peripheral nerve tumors are infrequent.

2614,"The medial septum mediates impairment of prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle induced by a hippocampal seizure or phencyclidine The involvement of the septohippocampal system on the impaired sensorimotor gating induced by phencyclidine (PCP) or by an electrically induced hippocampal seizure was examined in behaving rats. An impaired sensorimotor gating, measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, was observed following a hippocampal afterdischarge (AD) or systemic injection of PCP and was accompanied with an increase in hippocampal gamma waves (30-70 Hz). The medial septum infusion with muscimol (0.25 microg), a GABA(A) receptor agonist, 15 min prior to PCP or a hippocampal AD, prevented the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in gamma waves. By itself, muscimol (0.25 microg) injection into the medial septum did not affect PPI, although it significantly suppressed spontaneous gamma waves. In order to identify subpopulations of neurons mediating the sensorimotor gating deficit and the hippocampal gamma wave increase, 0.14-0.21 microg of p75 antibody conjugated to saporin (192 IgG-saporin) was injected into the medial septum to selectively lesion the septohippocampal cholinergic neurons. Neither the PPI deficit nor the gamma wave increase induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD was affected by 192 IgG-saporin lesion of the medial septum. It is concluded that increase in neural activity in the medial septum participates in the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in hippocampal gamma waves induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD. It is suggested that the GABAergic but not the cholinergic septohippocampal neurons mediate the sensorimotor gating deficit.",Excluded
3180,"Physiological roles of Na+/Ca2+ exchange in Limulus ventral photoreceptors In previous work we have presented evidence for electrogenic Na+/Ca2+ exchange in Limulus ventral photoreceptors (1989. J. Gen. Physiol. 93:473-492). This article assesses the contributions to photoreceptor physiology from Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Four separate physiological processes were considered: maintenance of resting sensitivity, light-induced excitation, light adaptation, and dark adaptation. (a) Resting sensitivity: reduction of [Na+]o caused a [Ca2+]o-dependent reduction in light sensitivity and a speeding of the time courses of the responses to individual test flashes; this effect was dependent on the final value to which [Na+]o was reduced. The desensitization caused by Na+ reduction was dependent on the initial sensitivity of the photoreceptor; in fully dark-adapted conditions no desensitization was observed; in light-adapted conditions, extensive desensitization was observed. (b) Excitation: Na+ reduction in fully dark-adapted conditions caused a Ca2+o-dependent depolarizing phase in the receptor potential that persisted beyond the stimulus duration and was evoked by a bright adapting flash. (c) Light adaptation: the degree of desensitization induced by a bright adapting flash was Na+o dependent, being larger with lower [Na+]o. Na+ reduction enhanced light adaptation only at intensities brighter than 4 x 10(-6) W/cm2. In addition to being Na+o dependent, light adaptation was Ca2+o dependent, being greater at higher [Ca2+]o. (d) Dark adaptation: the recovery of light sensitivity after adapting illumination was Na+o dependent. Dark adaptation after bright illumination in voltage-clamped and in unclamped conditions was faster in normal-Na+ saline than in reduced Na+ saline. The final sensitivity to which photoreceptors recovered was lower in reduced-Na+ saline when bright adapting illumination was used. The results suggest the involvement of Na+/Ca2+ exchange in each of these physiological processes. Na+/Ca2+ exchange may contribute to these processes by counteracting normal elevations in [Ca2+]i.",Excluded
3022,"Tracking target position variability using intraprostatic fiducial markers and electronic portal imaging in prostate cancer radiotherapy Modern radiotherapy has achieved substantial improvement in tumour control and toxicity rates by escalating the total dose to the target volume while sparing surrounding normal tissues. It has therefore become necessary to precisely track tumour position in order to minimise geometrical uncertainties due to setup errors and organ motion. We conducted this prospective evaluation of prostate cancer patients treated with image-guided conformal radiation therapy at our institution. We implanted three fiducial markers (gold seeds) within the prostatic gland in order to quantify daily target displacements and to generate specific margins around the clinical target volume (CTV) to create an appropriate planned target volume (PTV). Between April and December 2009, ten patients affected with localised prostate cancer were transrectally implanted with three radio-opaque markers. Each patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan for planning purposes following proper bladder and rectum preparation. During treatment two orthogonal images were acquired daily and compared with previously generated digitally reconstructed radiographs. After manual localisation, comparison between the position of the gold seeds on the portal and reference images was carried out, and a set of extrapolated lateral-lateral (LL), anterior-posterior (AP) and cranial-caudal (CC) shift corrections was calculated and recorded. Couch corrections were applied with a threshold of 3 mm displacement. Systematic and random errors for each direction were calculated either as measured according to displacement of the gold seeds prior to any couch movement and after couch position correction according to the radio-opaque markers. For skin marks, mean systematic and random errors were 0.12+2.94 mm for LL, 1.04+3.37 mm for AP, -1.14+2.71 mm for CC, whereas for seed markers, mean and systematic errors were 0.6+1.5 mm for LL, 0.51+2.45 mm for AP and -0.25+2.51 mm for CC. A scatter plot generated on all measurements after couch repositioning according to gold-seed displacement suggested a confidence range of shift distributions within 5 mm for LL, 8 mm for CC, and 7 mm for AP. The total systematic and random components were then used to calculate proper PTV in patients receiving conventional treatment (7 mm for LL and 9 mm for both AP and CC). Prostate positional variability during a course of radiation treatment is strongly influenced by setup and organ motion. Organ tracking through fiducial markers and electronic portal imaging is able to reduce the spread of displacements, significantly contributing to improve the ballistic precision of radiation delivery.",Excluded
2927,"Relapse in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma after treatment with 3F8+GM-CSF+CIS-retinoic acid in first complete/very good partial remission: Patterns, management and long-term outcome Background/Objectives: Anti-GD2 immunotherapy is now standard of care for high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB). However, prognosis after first relapse post-immunotherapy is deemed dismal; patients are often enrolled on early phase studies without curative intent. Design/Methods: HR-NB patients relapsing post-3F8+GMCSF+cis-retinoic acid (CRA) in first complete (CR) or very good partial remission (VGPR) (NCT00072358) underwent the following reinduction strategies: (1) Isolated CNS relapse (CNS-R): multimodality therapy including intra-Ommaya radioimmunotherapy (MM-RIT) (J Neurooncol 97:409). (2) Disseminated (D-R) or focal soft-tissue relapse (FS-R): High-dose chemotherapy using active agents as previously described (Cancer 119: 665; Bone Marrow Transplant 48:642; Pediatr Blood Cancer 56: 403; Eur J Cancer 47: 84; Cancer 116: 3054) +/-surgery (+/-IORT)+/-radiation. (3) Focal bone relapse (FB-R): low-dose chemotherapy (J Clin Oncol 24:5271) +/- radiation. Patients achieving second CR/VGPR were retreated with 3F8+GM+CRA (Oncoimmunol In Press 2015) +/-anti-GD2/GD3 humoral vaccine (ClinCanRes 20:1375). Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) analyses were performed (Kaplan-Maier method) and prognostic variables compared (log-rank test). Result(s): Of 145 consecutive patients treated with 3F8+GM+CRA in first CR/VGPR, 64 (44%) relapsed (median follow-up 60 months from starting 3F8): 17 CNS-R, 24 D-R, 12 FS-R, 11 FB-R. 39 (61%) achieved second CR. 19 (29%) continued in remission >5 years after relapse. Respective five-year PFS and OS rates (%) for groups CNS-R receiving MM-RIT, D-R, FS-R and FB-R were 77+/-12 and 68+/-13, 6+/-7 and 6+/-7, 25+/-13 and 30+/-7, 54+/-15 and 62+/-15. Adverse prognostic factors for survival post-relapse included failure to achieve second CR, D-R as opposed to other relapse patterns, and early (<6mo from starting 3F8 ) relapse (p<0.05 for each), but not MYCN amplification (p=0.4). Conclusion(s): Long-term PFS and OS are possible in HR-NB patients post-relapse if CR/VGPR can be achieved, especially when relapse is focal. Agents with proven anti-NB activity should be considered initially at first relapse rather than purely experimental approaches.",Excluded
2991,"Modulation of hypersensitivity to oxidative DNA damage in ATM defective cells induced by potassium bromate by inhibition of the Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein is a pivotal multifunctional protein kinase predominantly involved in DNA damage response, as well as in maintaining overall functional integrity of the cells. Apart from playing its major role in regulating the cellular response to DNA damage, ATM, when mutated, can additionally determine oxidative stress, metabolic syndrome, mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. In the present paper we aim to investigate the levels of oxidative stress potentially induced by the oxidizing rodent renal carcinogen KBrO<inf>3</inf> in ATM-defective lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) established from four classical AT patients (with different ATM mutations), one AT variant with reduced hypersensitivity to X rays, obligate AT heterozygotes and wild type intrafamilial control. A possible modulatory involvement of PARP in potentially induced oxidative stress is also evaluated following its inhibition with 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB). Treatments with KBrO<inf>3</inf> clearly showed a marked hypersensitivity of the ATM-defective LCLs, including the AT variant. A marked and statistically significant reduction of KBrO<inf>3</inf>-induced chromosomal damage following inhibition of PARP by 3-AB, was observed in all AT LCLs, but not in those from the AT variant, AT heterozygotes and wild type intrafamilial control. This result is suggestive of a modulatory involvement of PARP in the hypersensitivity of ATM-defective cells to DNA oxidative damage. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
3084,"Clinical applications and basic studies of laser in dentistry and oral surgery In our clinical use of lasers, mainly CO2 laser for oral surgery, we found that the laser had many advantages over an electrome and the laser improved the local control rate for malignant tumors. Low-power laser has been used to treat hypersensitive dentin, to relieve pain caused by neurotic disease around mouth, and to promote the healing of those diseases. The results obtained from the clinical applications showed that irradiation of the hypersensitive dentin with low-power laser was significantly effective in desensitization. An in vitro study showed no effects of diode or He-Ne laser irradiation on the growth of cells, but showed changes in the initial cell adhesion rate. He-Ne laser irradiation to the wound in the skin of hamsters caused to change the activities of the types I and III collagenase. This fact suggest that laser irradiation acted to promote the healing of wound.",Excluded
3223,"The involvement of ATF4 and S-opsin in retinal photoreceptor cell damage induced by blue LED light PURPOSE: Blue light is a high-energy emitting light with a short wavelength in the visible light spectrum. Blue light induces photoreceptor apoptosis and causes age-related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa. In the present study, we investigated the roles of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by blue light-emitting diode (LED) light exposure in murine photoreceptor cells.METHODS: The murine photoreceptor cell line was incubated and exposed to blue LED light (464 nm blue LED light, 450 lx, 3 to 24 h). The expression of the factors involved in the unfolded protein response pathway was examined using quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and immunoblot analysis. The aggregation of short-wavelength opsin (S-opsin) in the murine photoreceptor cells was observed with immunostaining. The effect of S-opsin knockdown on ATF4 expression in the murine photoreceptor cell line was also investigated.RESULTS: Exposure to blue LED light increased the bip, atf4, and grp94 mRNA levels, induced the expression of ATF4 protein, and increased the levels of ubiquitinated proteins. Exposure to blue LED light in combination with ER stress inducers (tunicamycin and dithiothreitol) induced the aggregation of S-opsin. S-opsin mRNA knockdown prevented the induction of ATF4 expression in response to exposure to blue LED light.CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the aggregation of S-opsin induced by exposure to blue LED light causes ER stress, and ATF4 activation in particular.",Excluded
3145,"MR Gd-DTPA enhancement of radiation brain injury MR examinations of 104 patients who had undergone radiotherapy to the brain were reviewed. Thirty-six patients received Gd-DTPA enhanced study during the course of MR evaluation and six of the patients showed enhancing radiation necrosis. Histopathological confirmations were obtained in three patients. Gd-DTPA enhancing radiation lesions were multiple and patchy in three patients, multiple and patchy with cyst formation in two and ring shaped in one. In terms of their distribution, enhancing lesions in four patients were seen only in the white matter within the irradiated field and these patients had undergone radiotherapy within five years. The interval after radiotherapy was more than eight years in two patients and their enhanced lesions were observed in both the white and gray matter. Histopathological findings of Gd-DTPA enhancing radiation necrosis were gliosis and coalescing vacuoles of the neural tissue. None of these enhanced radiation lesions showed significant mass effects. Patterns of the enhancement were not specific. It was considered to be difficult to differentiate tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis with conventional Gd-DTPA enhanced MR examinations. In one patient, delayed MR images after Gd-DTPA administration showed increases in the size and number of radiation enhanced lesions. Dynamic and delayed MR study might add more information to conventional imaging after Gd-DTPA. Further studies are necessary to differentiate radiation lesions from tumor recurrences.",Excluded
2568,"The action of pulse-modulated GSM radiation increases regional changes in brain activity and c-Fos expression in cortical and subcortical areas in a rat model of picrotoxin-induced seizure proneness The action of the pulse-modulated GSM radiofrequency of mobile phones has been suggested as a physical phenomenon that might have biological effects on the mammalian central nervous system. In the present study, GSM-exposed picrotoxin-pretreated rats showed differences in clinical and EEG signs, and in c-Fos expression in the brain, with respect to picrotoxin-treated rats exposed to an equivalent dose of unmodulated radiation. Neither radiation treatment caused tissue heating, so thermal effects can be ruled out. The most marked effects of GSM radiation on c-Fos expression in picrotoxin-treated rats were observed in limbic structures, olfactory cortex areas and subcortical areas, the dentate gyrus, and the central lateral nucleus of the thalamic intralaminar nucleus group. Nonpicrotoxin-treated animals exposed to unmodulated radiation showed the highest levels of neuronal c-Fos expression in cortical areas. These results suggest a specific effect of the pulse modulation of GSM radiation on brain activity of a picrotoxin-induced seizure-proneness rat model and indicate that this mobile-phone-type radiation might induce regional changes in previous preexcitability conditions of neuronal activation.",Excluded
3453,"A method of surgical laser treatment of trigeminal neuralgia Introduction: If conservative therapy in patients with trigeminal neuralgia is ineffective, different kinds of destruction of peripheral branches (alcoholization, phenol destructions, electric coagulation, etc.) are commonly used with subsequent development of marked perifocal cicatricial-commissural changes. Material(s) and Method(s): On the basis of advantages of high-energy laser radiation, we developed a method for treating trigeminal neuralgia by means of puncture laser destruction (neurotomy) of peripheral trigeminal branches on different levels. At first, a peripheral branch was blocked; if there was a positive clinical effect in the form of disappearance or significant reduction of a colicky pain, an optical quartz fibre 200-400 nm in diameter was inserted through an internal lumen of an intraneurally placed injection needle. The above quartz optical fibre serves for laser radiation influence with wavelength of 980 nm in a continuous mode using fractional portions by 2-4 seconds with an interval of 8-10 seconds and radiation power from 2 to 7 W until deep or total anaesthesia was achieved in the innervation area of a relevant nerve. Depending upon the diameter of a nerve, from 200 to 600 J were required. If necessary, the position of a needle with an optical fibre was changed, thereby causing a new focus of laser destruction until the required degree of innervation was achieved. During one operation it was possible to carry out laser destruction (neurotomy) of several nerve trunks. Result(s): From April 2011 to May 2012, 30 patients received treatment with use of a method of laser neurotomy of peripheral trigeminal branches. A positive effect was achieved in 27 cases. No complications were observed in the immediate and remote postoperative periods. Relapses were registered in 6 patients.",Excluded
3410,"Weak MGMT gene promoter methylation confers a clinically significant survival benefit in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma: a retrospective cohort study INTRODUCTION: Quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP) is a frequently used technique to assess MGMT gene promoter methylation in glioblastoma patients. The optimal technical cut-off value to distinguish methylated from unmethylated samples is nevertheless still undetermined. In literature, a ""grey zone"" of diagnostic uncertainty has been described.METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients treated according to the Stupp protocol. Epidemiological data were gathered from the individual patient files. MGMT gene promoter methylation status was determined on stored tumour samples using qMSP. A strong, weak or absent promoter methylation was determined based on Cq values (quantification value) of the MGMT and ACTB primers as well as a positive control sample.RESULTS: In total, 181 patient files were reviewed and included for statistical analysis. MGMT promoter hypermethylation was detected in 38.7% of glioblastoma patients. The median overall survival of unmethylated and strongly methylated patients was 10.1 months and 19.7 months respectively. Furthermore, 11% of the total patient cohort had a weak MGMT gene promoter methylation. The median OS in this subgroup was 15.4 months, significantly better compared to the unmethylated cohort (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed weak MGMT promoter methylation as an independent prognostic parameter for overall survival.CONCLUSION: Glioblastoma patients with weak promoter methylation show a statistically significant longer overall survival when compared to clearly unmethylated patients. Patients with grey zone qMSP test results should receive additional molecular analysis in future to further direct individual therapy strategies.",Excluded
2849,"Computational modelling of the cerebral cortical microvasculature: effect of x-ray microbeams versus broad beam irradiation Microbeam Radiation Therapy is an innovative pre-clinical strategy which uses arrays of parallel, tens of micrometres wide kilo-voltage photon beams to treat tumours. These x-ray beams are typically generated on a synchrotron source. It was shown that these beam geometries allow exceptional normal tissue sparing from radiation damage while still being effective in tumour ablation. A final biological explanation for this enhanced therapeutic ratio has still not been found, some experimental data support an important role of the vasculature. In this work, the effect of microbeams on a normal microvascular network of the cerebral cortex was assessed in computer simulations and compared to the effect of homogeneous, seamless exposures at equal energy absorption. The anatomy of a cerebral microvascular network and the inflicted radiation damage were simulated to closely mimic experimental data using a novel probabilistic model of radiation damage to blood vessels. It was found that the spatial dose fractionation by microbeam arrays significantly decreased the vascular damage. The higher the peak-to-valley dose ratio, the more pronounced the sparing effect. Simulations of the radiation damage as a function of morphological parameters of the vascular network demonstrated that the distribution of blood vessel radii is a key parameter determining both the overall radiation damage of the vasculature and the dose-dependent differential effect of microbeam irradiation.",Excluded

2723,"Central pain modulation after subthalamic nucleus stimulation: A crossover randomized trial OBJECTIVE: To investigate the acute effect of subthalamic nuclei deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) and levodopa on pain and tolerance thresholds in patients with Parkinson disease. We hypothesized that a modification of pain threshold after STN-DBS would suggest a central modification of pain perception, whereas the absence of pain threshold change after STN-DBS would correspond to a peripheral mechanism via a decrease of painful stimuli.METHODS: Nineteen patients with Parkinson disease were included in this double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Postoperatively, we evaluated pain thresholds (thermal and mechanical) and motor symptoms under 3 acute conditions: stimulation on/medication off; stimulation off/medication on; and stimulation off/medication off. We also conducted a retrospective analysis of the data prospectively recorded during the follow-up of the cohort pre- and postoperatively (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] score, Hoehn and Yahr stage, equivalent levodopa daily dose, and tapping test score).RESULTS: We found a significant increase of pain and tolerance mechanical thresholds not only after acute STN-DBS but also after acute levodopa administration. We did not find any significant correlation between postoperative clinical pain improvement and UPDRS-III improvement after acute levodopa or STN-DBS, nor with motor complications improvement assessed with UPDRS-IV after chronic STN-DBS. No correlation was found between postoperative clinical pain improvement and mechanical pain threshold modification.CONCLUSION: Clinical pain alleviation after STN-DBS cannot be considered merely as a consequence of motor complications improvement and could be attributable to a direct central modulation of pain perception, via increased mechanical pain and tolerance thresholds.",Excluded
2439,"Radiotherapy of maxillary cancer using 9 equi-spaced beam coplanar beam arrangement and 9 non-coplanar beam arrangement with beam angle optimization - A dosimetric comparison Background: IMRT is a novel radiotherapy that can deliver high conformal homogeneous dose to the target volume while sparing surrounding tissues and structures. Conventional routine IMRT usually uses equi-spaced beam arrangement of 5 to 9. However, in recent development, manipulating the beam arrangement of IMRT is offered in beam angle optimization (BAO), in which it automatically chooses optimized beam angles in either coplanar or non-coplanar beam arrangements. In Pugachev et al. (2001) study it has been suggested that improvement of the dose distribution was seen in complicated head and neck cancer cases with BAO. Nevertheless, opposite opinion has been raised by Stein et al. (1997) which stated that the marginal gain by manipulating beam angle diminished when there are more than 7 beams. Notwithstanding the controversy in study results, it was observed that careful selection of beam orientation contributed to a better dose distribution in the final treatment plan in clinical experience. This study is to investigate the dosimetric effect of manipulating beam angles with BAO in maxillary cancer cases compared with 9 equi-spaced beam co-planar arrangement. Method(s): The subjects in this study were recruited from the Princess Margaret Hospital, Kowloon, Hong Kong within the period of 1st Jan 2006 to 31st Dec 2010. Planning computed tomography (CT) images of the samples were retrospectively restored. Five samples were recruited using random sampling. It was an experimental study to test the effect of using equispaced beams, BAO and VMAT in IMRT. The parameters for comparison are tumour dose conformity, homogeneity; and the OARs maximum, mean dose. 2 plans were produced for each recruited patients. One using 9 equispaced beam arrangement and the other using 9 non-coplanar field using BAO. Result(s): For the five recruited patients, both 9 equi-spaced beam arrangement and BAO resulted in clinically satisfactory dose distribution and were of similar quality. It was found that IMRT plans with BAO resulted in better OARs sparing, including the parotid, cochlear, eyes, optic nerves, the optic chiasm and brain stem. In terms of target coverage, 4 out of 5 plans produced better in BAO when compared with 9 equi-spaced beam arrangement. Conclusion(s): The effect of the selection of beam angle orientations was significant within the samples. The choice of beam orientations is a factor affecting the dosimetric outcome even when the beam number is equal to 9.",Excluded

Seventy-six SD rats six weeks old were divided into control group (4 animals) and experimental groups (18 different subgroups) with 4 animals for each group. Healthy SD rats were exposed to the 460-480 nm blue light for 3 or 12 hours on three different irradiance of 0.6, 1.5 and 10.0 W/m(2) respectively. After recovery in darkness for 4 hours, 24 hours or 3 days, retinal tissue was collected after the eyes were enucleated. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to evaluate the general anatomical changes of the rat retinal layers. TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling was performed to detect apoptotic cells and immunofluorescence staining was conducted to illustrate the expression and location of related proteins in Muller cells. The number of ganglion cells was analyzed by one-way ANOVA.RESULTS: No injury was observed in SD rat retina at the irradiance of 0.6 W/m(2). Retinal cells were damaged with irradiance at 10.0 W/m(2), which mainly affected photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells, while Muller cells of retinal inner nuclear layer were also involved. Apoptosis began after 4 hours of exposure and peaked at 24 hours. Moderate damage of retina was observed at the irradiance of 1.5 W/m(2) after 12 hours rather than 3 hours exposure. The number of ganglion cells was significantly different among the different groups 3 days after exposure. When the exposure time was 3 hours, the number of retinal ganglion cells under different irradiance at 0.0, 0.6, 1.5 and 10.0 W/m(2) was respectively 41.42 +/- 0.17, 40.58 +/- 0.50, 40.92 +/- 0.32 and 22.83 +/- 0.79 (F = 1305.86, P = 0.000). When the exposure time was 12 hours, the number of retinal ganglion cells under different irradiance at 0.0, 0.6, 1.5 and 10.0 W/m(2) was respectively 41.42 +/- 0.17, 40.83 +/- 0.69, 41.08 +/- 0.17 and 22.75 +/- 0.83 (F = 1095.78, P = 0.000).

3580,"Some perturbations that disturb the circadian melatonin rhythm The circadian melatonin rhythm is highly reproducible and generally not easily altered. The few perturbations that are capable of significantly changing either the amplitude or the pattern of the 24-h melatonin rhythm are summarized herein. Aging alters cyclic melatonin production by decreasing the amplitude of the nocturnal melatonin peak in all species in which it has been studied. The best known acute suppressor of nocturnal melatonin is light exposure. The brightness of light required to acutely depress pineal melatonin production is species dependent; of the visible wavelengths, those in the blue range (approximately 500-520 nm) seem most effective in suppressing melatonin production. Nonvisible, nonionizing radiation in the extremely low frequency range (e.g., 60 Hz) seems also capable of altering pineal melatonin synthesis. Hormones have relatively little influence on the circadian production of melatonin, although either adrenalectomy or hypophysectomy does attenuate the amplitude of the melatonin cycle. Exercise at the time of high melatonin production rapidly depresses pineal concentrations of the indole without influencing its synthesis; the mechanism of this suppression remains unknown.

3363,"Simulation of pulsed ELF magnetic fields generated by GSM mobile phone handsets for human electromagnetic bioeffects research Human provocation studies that investigate the effects of Global System for Mobiles (GSM) communication systems on the brain have focused on Radio Frequency (RF) exposure.

The use of a commercial handset as an exposure source for such investigations is problematic for a number of reasons and therefore a simulated exposure source, capable of producing both RE and ELF components of exposure, is desirable. As a first step in developing such a source, we have quantified and characterized the ELF field from several commercial handsets (the RF characteristics being already well understood). Through experimental measurement we deduce that these fields can be sufficiently simulated by a 9mm radius loop residing 10mm beneath the front surface of the handset device and carrying enough current to generate peak fields of 25 muT at the surface of the handset.

3249,"Neuromagnetic responses to chords are modified by preceding musical scale Previous psychological studies have shown that musical chords primed by Western musical scale in a tonal and modal schema are perceived in a hierarchy of stability. We investigated such priming effects on auditory magnetic responses to tonic-major and submediant-minor chords preceded by major scales and tonic-minor and submediant-major chords preceded by minor scales. Musically trained subjects participated in the experiment. During MEG recordings, subjects judged perceptual stability of the chords. The tonic chords were judged to be stable, whereas the submediant chords were judged to be unstable. Dipole moments of N1m response originating in the auditory cortex were larger in the left hemisphere for the submediant chords than for the tonic chords preceded by the major but not minor scales. No difference in the N1m or P2m moment was found for the chords presented without preceding scales. These results suggest priming effects of the tonal schema, interacting with contextual modality, on neural activity of the auditory cortex as well as perceptual stability of the chords. It is inferred that modulation of the auditory cortical activity is associated with attention induced by tonal instability and modality shift, which characterize the submediant chords.",Excluded
2625,"A quantitative study of MRI-based treatment planning for the percutaneous radiation therapy of brain tumors. [German] This study examined to which extent treatment plans for brain tumors can be constructed with a commercial treatment planning system (TPS) based on MRI data only. Cad-Plan 6.4.7 was used as TPS. In particular, differences between MRT-based and conventional CT-based plans were examined systematically. The quantification of the retrospective evaluation was carried out by the point-wise dose difference and the gamma-distribution. In this study the gamma-distribution did not appear advantageous over the dose difference for the tolerance range (point-wise dose difference <3%, distance criterion LLL 5 mm). The calculated dose distribution showed large differences (up to 103%) at the boundary of the treatment fields, in the regions of the head contour, and in areas with air inclusions and significant bone structures. The inner parts of the fields, and therefore the actual target volume, revealed only small deviations in the range of -2% in the homogeneous distribution.",Excluded
3414,"Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for recurrent, residual, or untreated skull-base meningiomas: preliminary clinical experience OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for complex-shaped benign meningiomas of the skull base and report clinical experience.METHODS: Twenty patients with benign skull-base meningiomas WHO degrees I (histopathologically proven in 16/20) were treated with IMRT between June 1998 and August 1999. Each tumor was complex in shape and adherent to, or encompassed, organs at risk (cranial nerves, optic apparatus, and brainstem). All patients, immobilized in a customized head mask integrated into a stereotactic system, were planned on an inverse treatment planning system using 5 or 7 coplanar, equidistant beams and 5 intensity steps. Each treatment plan was verified extensively before treatment. Follow-up with MRI and clinical examination was performed at 6 and 18 weeks and every 6 months thereafter.RESULTS: Target volumes ranged from 27 to 278 cc (median: 108 cc). Mean dose in 32 fractions ranged between 55.8 and 58.2 Gy. At median follow-up of 36 months (range: 31-43 months), pre-existing neurologic symptoms improved in 12/20 (60%), remained stable in 7/20 (35%), and worsened in 1 (5%) patient. Radiographic follow-up revealed significant tumor shrinkage 6 weeks post-IMRT in 2 patients and partial remission in 3 more patients at 9-17 months; other tumor volumes remained stable. There was no radiation-induced peritumoral edema, increase in tumor size, or new onset of neurologic deficits. Transient acute treatment side effects included nausea and vomiting and single occurrences of conjunctivitis/increased tearing and serous tympanitis.CONCLUSION: IMRT in the treatment of central nervous system meningiomas is feasible and safe, offering highly conformal irradiation for complex-shaped skull-base tumors while sparing adjacent critical structures. If the tumor remissions seen here are found in the ongoing treatments, IMRT may be considered the treatment of choice for inoperable or subtotally resected meningiomas and for otherwise difficult-to-treat, complex-shaped tumors of the central nervous system adjacent to critical structures, with the potential of dose escalation for malignant tumors.",Excluded

3063,"Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors enable two distinct forms of long-term depression in the rat dentate gyrus in vivo The existence of long-term depression (LTD) in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats, as well as the contribution of different types of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) to this form of plasticity, has been the subject of much debate. Here, we describe two distinct forms of mGluR-dependent hippocampal LTD in the dentate gyrus of freely moving adult rats. LTD, induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) of the medial perforant path (LFS-LTD), was prevented by antagonism of the phospholipase C-coupled receptors, mGluR1 but not mGluR5. Chemical LTD, induced by intracerebral application of the group I mGluR agonist (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, was blocked by antagonism of both mGluR5 and mGluR1. Selective activation of mGluR5, using (R,S)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG), also led to chemical LTD. To test whether LFS-LTD and chemical LTD share common induction mechanisms, we applied LFS following the induction of chemical LTD by CHPG (CHPG-LTD). Surprisingly, LFS impaired CHPG-LTD. Further analysis revealed that induction of CHPG-LTD led to altered calcium dynamics sufficient for its reversal by LFS. We found that LTD induced by (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, but not by CHPG, is impaired by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonism. Both forms of chemical LTD strongly require calcium influx through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. This contrasts with previous findings that LFS-LTD in the dentate gyrus is both N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and voltage-gated calcium channel independent. LFS-LTD and LTD induced by group I mGluR agonists thus appear to comprise distinct forms of LTD that require the activation of specific group I mGluRs and recruit calcium from different sources.",Excluded
3276,"The effectiveness and factors related to treatment results of gamma knife radiosurgery for meningiomas A retrospective analysis was conducted on 80 patients with intracranial mengiomas treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery between 1993 and 1996. The purpose was to analyze the efficacy of the treatment and to assess appropriate treatment parameters. The results were assessed by regular MR examinations, and tumor volume was measured at 6-month intervals. Mean follow-up duration was 21 months (range 6-45 months). 63 meningiomas were at the skull base and 17 were distal from the skull base. Tumor volumes <5 ml (n=38), 5-10 ml (n=21), 10-15 ml (n=14), 15-20 ml (n=7). The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the radiation dose. The groups were high- dose (peripheral dose 17-20 Gy, n=19), medium-dose (15-16 Gy, n=33) and low- dose (12-14 Gy, n=28) groups. A statistical method (Generalized Estimation Equation) was applied to compare treatment results in these groups with different doses and tumor volumes. The volume measurement at the latest follow-up showed 74% (59/80) meningiomas decreased in volume, 17% (14/80) had no tumor enlargement and 9% (7/80) had increased in volume. The increased volume was found more frequently in the patients with a short (6-12 months) follow-up period. In this series, the tumors had 32% reduction in average tumor volume at 3 years after radiosurgery. At the range of 12-20 Gy peripheral dose (PD), radiosurgery was effective to reduce tumor volume 0.7% per month (p<0.05). However, higher doses had no significant difference on tumor volume reduction (p > 0.05). On the other hand, high-dose (PD > 17 Gy) treatment was associated with a higher risk of temporary tumor swelling and the development of adverse radiation effects (AREs). The AREs detected on MR images occurred in (25/80) 31% patients. Only 6/25 AREs were symptomatic and 2 had neurological sequelae. Peripheral doses, tumor volumes and their locations had significant impacts on the ARE (p<0.05). In conclusion, a peripheral dose of 15-16 Gy may be adequate for meningiomas with small volumes (<=5 ml). In larger tumors (>=10 ml) a lower PD is preferred (12-14 Gy). To avoid initial tumor swelling and ARE, high-dose irradiation (PD > 17 Gy) is not recommended for meningiomas larger than 5 ml.",Excluded

The Morris water maze learning and the LTP in the CA1 area of the hippocampal slice were observed in wild-type mice and mutant mice lacking D-amino-acid oxidase. The mutant mice showed significantly shorter platform search times in the water maze and significantly larger hippocampal LTPs than the wild-type mice. These results suggest that the abundant D-amino-acids in the mutant mouse brain facilitate hippocampal LTP and spatial learning.",Excluded

The aim of the study was to analyze the positive margin cases in our Breast Unit, risk factors for inadequate margin and the impact of positive margin on outcomes after breast-conserving therapy. Material(s) and Method(s): 107 women with invasive breast cancer (T1-2, N0-2, M0) diagnosed between 2005-2010, who underwent breastconserving surgery(BCS) as first surgery, were retrospectively selected from the Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital Breast Unit Registry. A positive resection margin was defined as a microscopic invasive or in situ tumor at the cutting edge in permanent pathologic reports. Result(s): The mean tumor size was 1.65 cm in the positive margin group and 1.68 cm in the other group(p > 0.893). 13 of 107 (12.1%) had positive margins at initial resection. Of these patients 4(30.7%)had involved caudal margin, 2 (15.3%) cranial margin, 2 (15.3%) medial margin, 2(15.3%) deep margin and 1 (7.6%) lateral margin, there were insufficient data available about the type of margin in 2 cases. 8 (61.5%) had an invasive carcinoma at the margins and in other cases carcinoma in situ was detected. 4 (30.7%) underwent additional surgery-mastectomy, to achieve negative margins. Postoperative radiation was performed for 12 (92.3%) patients. 7 (53.8%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with inadequate margins had ER positive tumors in 76.5% vs. 47.3% in other group, PR positive tumors in 46.8% vs. 52.3% in other, HER 2/neu negative tumors in 76.9% vs. 56.2% in other. Patients with a positive margins at the initial resection showed higher lobular histology rate (15.3% vs. 6.4%), incidence of multiple ipsilateral tumors (23.1% vs. 15.4%), presens of intraductal component (76.9% vs. 65.1%), but these differences between two groups were no statistically significant. 73.1% of all patients were tested for the two common founder mutaions in BRCA1(4153delA and 5382insC). There was 1 BRCA1(5382insC) mutation-positive patient in the other group and no mutation-positive patients in the positive margin group. Mean follow-up time was 19.9(11-37) months, and there were no local recurrences during the follow-up period in the tumor positive margin group.

3285,"Chromosome end associations, telomeres and telomerase activity in ataxia telangiectasia cells Cells derived from individuals with ataxia telangiectasia (AT) show enhanced spontaneous levels of chromosomal abnormalities and are sensitive to ionizing radiations and radiomimetic drugs, as evidenced by decreased survival and increased chromosome aberration frequencies at mitosis when compared with normal cell lines. The higher base line frequencies of chromosome aberrations in part involve chromosome end-to-end associations as seen at metaphase. Since telomeres of tumor cells and aging tissues are often reduced in length, chromosome end associations may be due to loss of telomeric repeats. We studied the chromosome behavior and telomeres of two ataxia telangiectasia lymphoblastoid cell lines compared to two normal control cell lines. The ataxia telangiectasia cell lines showed higher frequencies of chromosome end associations both at metaphase and in interphase, determined in prematurely condensed chromosomes of G1 and G2 cells. They also showed higher frequencies of chromosomal breaks at metaphase and fewer telomeric signals determined using fluorescent in situ hybridization with a (TTAGGG)n probe. The frequency of telomeric repeats was variable in the ataxia telangiectasia cell lines (4.3 and 8.2 kb) compared to the normal cell lines (9.6 and 12 kb) and an inverse correlation between telomere length and chromosome end associations was observed. Both ataxia telangiectasia cell lines showed more robust telomerase activity than the normal cell lines, precluding defective enzymatic capacity as the basis for the chromosome end associations. It is possible that chromatin structure in the form of telomere-nuclear matrix interactions are variant in ataxia telangiectasia cells negatively influencing telomerase function and contributing to telomere associations.",Excluded
2779,"Imaging the back pain patient Imaging is an integral part of the clinical examination of the patient with back pain; it is, however, often used excessively and without consideration of the underlying literature. The primary role of imaging is the identification of systemic disease as a cause of the back or limb pain; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) excels at this. Systemic disease as a cause of back or limb pain is, however, rare. Most back and radiating limb pain is of benign nature, owing to degenerative phenomena. There is no role for imaging in the initial evaluation of the patient with back pain in the absence of signs or symptoms of systemic disease. When conservative care fails, imaging may be undertaken with due consideration of its risks: labeling the patient as suffering from a degenerative disease, cost, radiation exposure, and provoking unwarranted minimally invasive or surgical intervention. Imaging can well depict disc degeneration and disc herniation. Imaging can suggest the presence of discogenic pain, but the lack of a pathoanatomic gold standard obviates any definitive conclusions. The imaging natural history of disc herniation is resolution. There is very poor correlation between imaging findings of disc herniation and the clinical presentation or course. Psychosocial factors predict functional disability due to disc herniation better than imaging. Imaging with MRI, computed tomography (CT), or CT myelography can readily identify central canal, lateral recess, or foraminal compromise. Only when an imaging finding is concordant with the patient's pain pattern or neurologic deficit can causation be considered. The zygapophysial (facet) and sacroiliac joint are thought to be responsible for axial back pain, although with less frequency than the disc. Imaging findings of the structural changes of osteoarthritis do not correlate with pain production. Physiologic imaging, either with single-photon emission CT bone scan, heavily T2-weighted MRI sequences (short-tau inversion recovery), or gadolinium enhancement, can detect inflammation and are more predictive of an axial pain generator.",Excluded
2676,"Space radiation-induced inhibition of neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and memory impairment in mice: ameliorative potential of the melatonin metabolite, AFMK Evaluation of potential health effects from high energy charged particle radiation exposure during long duration space travel is important for the future of manned missions. Cognitive health of an organism is considered to be maintained by the capacity of hippocampal precursors to proliferate and differentiate. Environmental stressors including irradiation have been shown to inhibit neurogenesis and are associated with the onset of cognitive impairments. The present study reports on the protective effects of N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), a melatonin metabolite, against high energy charged particle radiation-induced oxidative damage to the brain. We observed that radiation exposure (2.0 Gy of 500 MeV/nucleon (56)Fe beams, a ground-based model of space radiation) impaired the spatial memory of mice at later intervals without affecting the motor activities. AFMK pretreatment significantly ameliorated these neurobehavioral ailments. Radiation-induced changes in the population of immature and proliferating neurons in the dentate gyrus were localized using anti-doublecortin (Dcx) and anti-Ki-67 expression. AFMK pretreatment significantly inhibited the loss of Dcx and Ki-67 positive cells. Moreover, AFMK pretreatment ameliorated the radiation-induced augmentation of protein carbonyls and 4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde (MDA + HAE) in the brain and maintained the total antioxidant capacity of plasma and nonprotein sulfhydryl contents in brain.",Included
2618,"Quetiapine attenuates cognitive impairment and decreases seizure susceptibility possibly through promoting myelin development in a rat model of malformations of cortical development Developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and refractory epilepsy are the most frequent consequences found in patients suffering from malformations of cortical development (MCD). However, therapeutic options for these psychiatric and neurological comorbidities are currently limited. The development of white matter undergoes dramatic changes during postnatal brain maturation, thus myelination deficits resulting from MCD contribute to its comorbid diseases. Consequently, drugs specifically targeting white matter are a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of MCD. We have used an in utero irradiation rat model of MCD to investigate the effects of postnatal quetiapine treatment on brain myelination as well as neuropsychological and cognitive performances and seizure susceptibility. Fatally irradiated rats were treated with quetiapine (10mg/kg, i.p.) or saline once daily from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P30. We found that postnatal administration of quetiapine attenuated object recognition memory impairment and improved long-term spatial memory in the irradiated rats. Quetiapine treatment also reduced the susceptibility and severity of pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. Importantly, quetiapine treatment resulted in an inhibition of irradiation-induced myelin breakdown in the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum. These findings suggest that quetiapine may have beneficial, postnatal effects in the irradiated rats, strongly suggesting that improving MCD-derived white matter pathology is a possible underlying mechanism. Collectively, these results indicate that brain myelination represents an encouraging pharmacological target to improve the prognosis of patients with MCD.",Excluded
3119,"Growth of beta-amyloid(1-40) protofibrils by monomer elongation and lateral association. Characterization of distinct products by light scattering and atomic force microscopy Amyloid plaques in brain tissue are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Primary components of these plaques are 40- and 42-residue peptides, denoted A beta(1-40) and A beta(1-42), that are derived by proteolysis of cellular amyloid precursor protein. Synthetic A beta(1-40) and A beta(1-42) form amyloid fibrils in vitro that share many features with the amyloid in plaques. Soluble intermediates in A beta fibrillogenesis, termed protofibrils, have been identified previously, and here we describe the in vitro formation and isolation of A beta(1-40) protofibrils by size exclusion chromatography. In some experiments, the A beta(1-40) was radiomethylated to better quantify various A beta species. Mechanistic studies clarified two separate modes of protofibril growth, elongation by monomer deposition and protofibril-protofibril association, that could be resolved by varying the NaCl concentration. Small isolated protofibrils in dilute Tris-HCl buffers were directed along the elongation pathway by addition of A beta(1-40) monomer or along the association pathway by addition of NaCl. Multi-angle light scattering analysis revealed that protofibrils with initial molecular masses M(w) of (7-30) x 10(3) kDa grew to M(w) values of up to 250 x 10(3) kDa by these two growth processes. However, the mass per unit length of the associated protofibrils was about 2-3 times that of the elongated protofibrils. Rate constants for further elongation by monomer deposition with the elongated, associated, and initial protofibril pools were identical when equal number concentrations of original protofibrils were compared, indicating that the original number of protofibril ends had not been altered by the elongation or association processes. Atomic force microscopy revealed heterogeneous initial protofibrils that became more rodlike following the elongation reaction. Our data indicate that protofibril elongation in the absence of NaCl results from monomer deposition only at the ends of protofibrils and proceeds without an increase in protofibril diameter. In contrast, protofibril association occurs in the absence of monomer when NaCl is introduced, but this association involves lateral interactions that result in a relatively disordered fibril structure.",Excluded

3284,"The contribution of DNA and chromosome repair deficiencies to the radiosensitivity of ataxia-telangiectasia Cells derived from individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) are more sensitive to ionizing radiation and radiomimetic drugs, as evidenced by decreased survival and increased chromosome aberrations at mitosis when compared with normal cell lines. Our previous studies showed that, despite similar initial levels of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), AT cells express higher initial chromosome damage than do normal cells as demonstrated by the technique of premature chromosome condensation. However, this finding accounted for only a portion of the increased sensitivity (T. K. Pandita and W. N. Hittelman, Radiat. Res. 130, 94-103, 1992). The purpose of the study reported here was to examine the contribution of DNA and chromosome repair to the radiosensitivity of AT cells. Exponentially growing AT and normal lymphoblastoid cells were fractionated into cell cycle phase-enriched populations by centrifugal elutriation, and their DNA and chromosome repair characteristics were evaluated by DNA neutral filter elution (for DNA DSBs) and by premature chromosome condensation, respectively. AT cells exhibited a reduced fast-repair component in both G1- and G2-phase cells, as observed at the level of both DNA DSBs and the chromosome; however, S-phase cells showed nearly normal DNA DSB repair. The findings that AT cells exhibit an increased level of chromosome damage and a deficiency in the fast component (but not the slow component) of repair suggest that chromatin organization might play a major role in the observed sensitivity of AT cells. When survival was plotted as a function of the residual amount of chromosome damage in G1- and G2- phase cells after 90 min of repair, the curves for normal and AT cells approached each other but did not overlap. These results suggest that, although higher initial levels of chromosome damage and reduced chromosome repair capability can explain much of the radiosensitivity of AT cells, other differences in AT cells must also contribute to their sensitivity phenotype.",Included

This hypothesis was previously tested in rat 9L brain tumor cells in which DFMO increased both the uptake and the retention of [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine. In these rat cells, DFMO-induced retention of high-specific-activity [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine for 20 days resulted in several logs killing. In the present studies all of the 5 different human glioma cell lines tested with DFMO treatment also showed enhanced uptake of exogenous [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine, reduced cell counts and enhanced killing of colony forming cells (CSF). Extending the time of DFMO treatment of cells that had taken up high-specific-activity (80 Ci/mmol) [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine further increased the killing. A 10-day extension resulted in a 10,000-fold reduction in cumulative cell growth. A 5-day extension resulted in a 2-3 log decrease in numbers of surviving CFC. These data further support the hypothesis and suggest that DFMO-induced cell cycle arrest enhances cellular retention of [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine, increasing the effective internal radiation dose enough to cause proliferative death. In a clinical setting, the short (~ 1 mum) path-length of the tritium beta particle should limit effects to the tumor cells and spare adjacent normal cells.

The eye shield does not produce as marked a reduction in radiation dose to the lens of the eye, when an angled gantry is used, since the eyes are not in the primary beam.

Patients received 30 Gy XRT given in 10 fractions to the whole brain. In phase I, patients were treated in groups of three at each topotecan dose level; dose escalation proceeded until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was identified. The dose-limiting toxicity proved to be grade IV neutropenia at 0.6 mg/m2/d, resulting in an MTD of 0.5 mg/m2/d. One of nine patients showed a response to treatment, and that was partial (OR 11%). Three had stable disease (33%), and four experienced progressive disease (44%). Median progression-free survival was 60 d; median overall survival was 102 d. Intravenous topotecan at 0.5 mg/m2/d concomitant to XRT with 30 Gy in 3-Gy fractions is tolerable in patients with brain metastases. This regimen has the additional advantage of providing systemic treatment to patients with metastases in other locations while whole brain radiation is in progress.

This indicates that we live in a partial deficiency of ionizing radiation. Cancer mortality rate is an important criterion to evaluate the effect of low doses of ionizing radiation. Valuable evidence is available from the deaths of nuclear workers who were exposed to low doses of radiation in energy, weapons and ship building plants. The cancer mortality rate in 120,000 exposed nuclear workers was only 63% that of 200,000 control workers in the same plants. Evidence from 8 million person-years experience indicates that low levels of ionizing radiation are beneficial.

Transmission scans (3 min per step, eight or nine steps according to the height of the subject) in 2D mode were used for subsequent attenuation correction of emission scans. Emission scans (1 min per step, eight or nine steps) were acquired over 2 h. Venous blood samples and urine were collected up to 2 h after injection of the radiotracer. For each subject, the percentage of injected activity measured in regions of interest over brain, intestine, lungs, kidneys and liver was fitted to a mono-exponential model, as an uptake phase followed by a mono-exponential washout, for urinary bladder to generate time-activity curves. Using the MIRD method, several source organs were considered in estimating residence time and mean effective radiation absorbed doses.RESULTS: Blood pressure and ECG findings remained unchanged after tracer injection. The analysed blood and urine pharmacological parameters did not change significantly after [(11)C]raclopride injection. The primary routes of clearance were renal and intestinal. Ten minutes after injection, high activities were observed in the gall-bladder, kidneys and liver. High activity was observed in the gall-bladder during the whole study.

3361,"Role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSCs radiation response; regeneration or senescence? Purpose or Objective Secretory function restoration is a challenge for regenerative therapy of radiation-damaged salivary glands. Recently, stem cell therapy has been proposed to allow such a functional regeneration. It has been suggested that glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes survival of mice salivary gland stem cells (mSGSCs). GDNF-treatment in combination with stem cell based regenerative therapy could represent a promising treatment for radiation-induced hyposalivation and consequential xerostomia. However, the role of GDNF on SGSC survival and proliferation after therapeutic irradiation is still an enigma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSC response to irradiation. Material and Methods Salivary gland organoid derived cells of Gdnf hypermorphic (Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup>) and wild-type mice (Gdnfwt/wt) were irradiated (IR) with gamma-rays at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8Gy. mSGSC survival and stemness were assessed by calculating stem cell surviving fraction measured as post- IR organoid forming potential and population doublings. Flow cytometry was used to determine the CD24<sup>hi</sup>/CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell (SC) population. qPCR and immunofluorescence were used to detect GDNF expression. Six-day-old salivary gland organoids were irradiated with 7 Gy of yrays, IR induced organoids senescence were confirmed by SA-s-Gal and P16 staining. Results Exogenously added GDNF or increase expression of GDNF in hypermorphic mice SGSC induced an increase in secondary organoids formation efficiency when compared to wild-type mice/untreated SG (p<0.05). However, neither endogenous nor exogenous GDNF increased the CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell-like population. Organoids IR surviving fraction (OSF) of mSGSCs were similar albeit resulted in larger spheres and an increased cell number in the Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> compared to Gdnfwt/wt group. Indeed, mSGSC of Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> mice showed high sphere forming efficiency upon replating. Cell cycle distribution of SGSC after irradiation had no difference with or without GDNF. Interestingly, GDNF expression was highly upregulated after irradiation both in vitro (p=0.008) and in vivo (p<0.05) but normalized in vivo after mSGSC transplantation-related regeneration. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) expression was strongly related to OSF (r=0.842, p=0.002) and co-localized with GDNF in salivary gland striated ducts. More than 90% IR induced senescence located in striated ducts where GDNF colocalized with senescence marker p16 and SA-s-Gal. Interestingly, senescence cells were detected in organoids after IR. Conclusion GDNF does not protect mSGSCs against irradiation but seems to promote mSGSCs proliferation through the GDNF-RET signaling pathway. Post-transplantation stimulation of GDNF/RET pathway may enhance the regenerative potential of mSGSCs. IR induced upregulation of GDNF may be involved in IR induced senescence.",Included
3385,"Capillary optics for neutron capture therapy The development of capillary neutron optics permits a new technology for neutron capture therapy involving the application of a focused thermal neutron beam at the medically optimal location within the patient. A subthermal neutron beam begins to converge as it travels through a neutron 'lens,' reaching a narrow focus within a tube that allows it to pass directly to the treatment region. This technique results in a substantially lower dose to untreated parts of the patient and a substantially weaker radiation field in the treatment room generally. Additional advantages include the relative ease of thermal neutron generation and the ability to shield the patient completely and effectively from fast neutrons or gamma rays originating at the neutron source. This work describes the application of capillary optics to neutron capture therapy, along with Monte Carlo calculations of the neutron flux profiles within a patient for an optimized system design. Specific dose profiles for the case of boron neutron capture therapy within the brain are also provided.",Excluded

2705,"Multisession radiosurgery for sellar and parasellar benign meningiomas: Long-term tumor growth control and visual outcome BACKGROUND: Concern about radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) has governed recent thinking about the role of radiation therapy in the treatment of meningiomas involving the anterior optic pathways. Despite this concern, during the last few years, the use of radiosurgery for such lesions has increased steadily. OBJECTIVE(S): To define both the tumor control rate and the risk of RION over a long-term follow-up period in a large cohort of patients treated with multisession radiosurgery. METHOD(S): The local control and visual outcome of 143 patients who underwent multisession radiosurgery (mRS) were evaluated. Neurological outcome was also analyzed. The data for the present study were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. RESULT(S): The mean follow-up was 44 months (range, 12-113 months). All patients underwent mRS. The median prescription dose was 25 Gy delivered in 3 to 5 fractions. The prescription isodose, which typically encompassed at least 95% of the tumor, ranged from 65% to 86% (median, 80%). The mean tumor volume was 11.0 cm 3 (range, 0.1-126.3 cm 3; median, 8 cm 3). The progression-free survival at 3, 5, and 8 years was 100%, 93%, and 90%, respectively. Compared with baseline, visual function improved in 36% of patients, whereas 7.4% experienced a worsening in visual function (5.1% excluding the patients with progressive disease). CONCLUSION(S): Good local control rate and a low risk of RION indicate that mRS is a safe and effective treatment option in cases of large meningiomas.

The aim of this study is to explore prognostic factors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with brain metastases diagnosed by constrast-enhanced MRI after whole brain radiotherapy.METHODS: TA retrospective review of clinical data from 241 NSCLC patients with brain metastases received whole brain radiotherapy from April 2007 to October 2008 was performed. A number of potential factors that might affect prognosis after irradiation were evaluated. The significance of prognostic variables in the survival resulted from univariate analysis by Kaplan-Meier combining with Log-rank test, and the multivariate analysis was obtained by Cox regression model.RESULTS: Median follow-up time for the survivors was 19.1 months. For all patients, the median survival time (MST) was 8.7 months. By univariate analysis, female patients with KPS>70, no symptom when diagnosed with brain metastases, tumor controlled in the chest, and received more than 3 cycles of chemotherapy and combined target therapy were the important factors for overall survival. By multivariate analysis, female, tumors controlled in the chest, and combined target therapy were independent prognostic factors for NSCLC patients with brain metastases. Tumor controlled in the chest was the most important independent prognostic factor.CONCLUSIONS: Gender, local tumor controlled, and combined target therapy significantly influenced NSCLC brain metastases diagnosed by constrast-enchanced MRI survival after whole brain radiotherapy.eciated patient subsets and is a useful method for dissecting complex clinical situations.

Only few patients did not harbor extracranial metastases. Systemic therapy after diagnosis of brain metastases has been used in only three patients. Surgical resection and/or radiosurgery have been administered in 34% of patients, but whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) alone remained the cornerstone. Median survival was 4.1 months (3.7 months in the WBRT alone group, 10.1 months in the surgery and/or radiosurgery group). Two factors were significantly associated with better survival: solitary brain metastasis and age <=64 years. The prognostic impact of the recursive partitioning analysis classes was not confirmed, while the new graded prognostic assessment index performed better.CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection and/or radiosurgery contribute to prolonged survival. As most patients harbor extracranial metastases that threaten their lives, systemic treatment theoretically might play a role in the management of these patients, but more data need to be collected to confirm the clinical impact of immunotherapy, angiogenesis inhibition, and other signal transduction inhibitor approaches.",Excluded
2627,"Use of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC (TEKTROTYD) for radioguided surgery of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: A feasibility study Purpose: Surgical resection of primary tumor and involved lymph nodes in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroen-docrine tumors (GEP-NETs) has a significant prognostic impact. Aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility of radioguided surgical nodal staging using <sup>99M</sup>Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC(TEKTROTYD) in GEP-NETs. Subjects and methods: Patients with histologically proven GEP-NET eligible to radical or palliative surgery showing avid tumor uptake on <sup>99M</sup>Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy and SPECT/CT were prospectively enrolled. Approximately 4h before surgery, 185 MBq of <sup>99M</sup>Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC were i.v. administered. Intraoperative localization of primary tumor and radioactive lymph nodes was performed using a hand-held gamma-probe set on <sup>99M</sup>Tc energy peak. Radioactive lymph nodes were localized and excised before proceeding to regional lymphadenectomy. Extra-regional lymphatic basins were also investigated. Resected specimens were re-evaluated ex vivo with the gamma-probe after macroscopic lymph node isolation. Result(s): Since February 2017, fve GEP-NET patients were enrolled (3 pts had G1-G2 ileal NET, 1 pt G2 rectal NET and 1 pt gastric NEC). All primary lesions seen on pre-operative scin-tigraphy were successfully localized with gamma-probe and completely excised. Mean in-vivo tumor count-rate was 399 counts-per-second/cps (range 80-496). Histological examination confrmed pre-operative diagnosis in all cases. A total of 107 lymph nodes was resected (mean number per patient 21, range 14-40), including 35 radioactive lymph nodes (mean number 7, range 3-12). Mean in-vivo nodal count-rate was 185 cps (range 14-722). 20/35 radioactive lymph nodes were meta-static at histologic examination (mean number 4, range 1-11). No metastatic involvement of ""cold"" lymph nodes was reported. Notably, ex-vivo count-rate of metastatic lymph nodes showed no significant variation from in-vivo gamma-probe evaluation, whereas non-involved nodes showed generally a sharp decrease in ex-vivo count-rate. In one patient, radioguided nodal evaluation determined the localization of a metastatic node in a extra-regional district. Median follow-up after surgery was 11 months (range 5-13). Clinical and instrumental follow-up evaluation showed stable disease in every patient, with no evidence of nodal disease recurrence. Conclusion(s): This pilot study con-frmed feasibility of radioguided nodal staging in GEP-NET patients. The use of <sup>99M</sup>Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC allowed manageable surgical scheduling, limiting radiation exposure of patients and medical staf. Moreover, this procedure can be performed using a standard gamma-probe routinely used for sentinel lymph node biopsy. Preliminary results on false-negative rate suggest that this could represent a reliable approach for surgical nodal staging with a clinical impact on prognosis.",Excluded
3391,"Rod photoreceptor dysfunction in diabetes: activation, deactivation, and dark adaptation PURPOSE: To examine photoreceptor function in diabetes in detail by evaluating photoreceptor light activation, deactivation of the photoresponse, and recovery of the photoreceptor after bleaching (dark adaptation) in rats made diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ).METHODS: Animals were assigned to treated and control groups. Light activation in rod photoreceptors was established using a paired-flash electroretinogram (ERG) protocol, and the leading edge of the a-wave was modeled with the mechanisms mediating phototransduction. Deactivation of the photoreceptor response was evaluated at three luminous exposures (1.4-2.2 log cd.m/s-2) using a variable interstimulus interval (ISI) paradigm. Dark adaptation was evaluated at 90-second intervals for 30 minutes after approximately 20% pigment bleach. At each time point, a paired-flash signal (1.4 log cd.s/m-2) was used to extract rod responses.RESULTS: Diabetic animals showed decreased amplitudes of the photoreceptor response 12 weeks after diabetes induction. No difference was found in the rate of deactivation of the photoresponse in diabetic rats. Normalized amplitudes showed that diabetic animals had significantly faster dark adaptation (P<0.01) than did controls.CONCLUSIONS: Although photoreceptor activation was abnormal, deactivation was unaltered after 12 weeks of diabetes. The faster relative recovery found in diabetes after bleach, in the presence of normal pigment dynamics, may reflect a decrease in outer segment lengths.",Excluded

The ectodermic origin of melanocytes and the presence of melanin in the substantia nigra are the theoretic basis of the experimental use of this class of tracers for melanoma imaging.METHODS: Eleven patients with proven metastatic melanoma entered the study. Whole-body and planar scintigrams were performed 2, 4 and 24 hr after intravenous injection of a mean tracer activity of 205 MBq. The dosimetric evaluation was performed by the Medical Internal Radiation Dose Committee method.RESULTS: The [123I]-(S)-IBZM scans allowed the detection of all six cutaneous lesions, five of six superficial pathologic lymph nodes, four of five pulmonary and one of two hepatic metastases. The maximum tumor-to-background ratio was 2.6 in planar images. The hepatobiliary excretion of the tracer may limit detection of intra-abdominal lesions. Dosimetry is similar to data for nononcologic patients.CONCLUSION: Although it is unclear if the mechanism of radiopharmaceutical uptake in melanoma is due to binding to membrane receptors or due to interactions with intracellular structures, radiolabeled benzamide is a promising tracer to detect melanoma.",Excluded
2624,"Locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Delivering neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to concurrent chemoradiation therapy Purpose/Objective(s): The standard of care for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT). Patients with large tumors at presentation which are close to dose-limiting structures such as the optic chiasm and brain stem may pose a challenging clinical problem. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) prior to CRT can be used to shrink the tumor and may therefore be a valuable strategy to optimize treatment planning. Studies in Asia have reported favorable outcomes with NC for NPC. The goal of this study was to characterize the patterns of use of NC for NPC at a Canadian center. Materials/Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of locally advanced NPC patients treated between 2000 and 2013. Patients who received NC with the intention to downsize locally advanced tumors prior to CRT were included. Baseline demographics, chemotherapy, radiation therapy treatments, and follow-up data were obtained from institutional databases and chart review and analyzed with SPSS. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), progression-free survival (PFS), local regional relapse-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival functions. Result(s): Forty-six patients were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 47 (range 18-75). Eighty percent of patients were male, 74% were of Asian ethnicity, and 87% had an ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Ninetyfour percent of patients had T3 or T4 tumors; 80% were node positive; 26% stage III, 67% IVA, 4% IVB. NC regimens included cisplatin/gemcitabine 87%, cisplatin/fluorouracil 6%, and cisplatin/etoposide 6%. The total neoadjuvant dose of cisplatin received ranged from 24mg/m<sup>2</sup> to 325 mg/m<sup>2</sup> with a median dose of 160mg/m<sup>2</sup>. The most common dose fractionations prescribed were 70 Gy in 35fractions for 67% of cases and 66 Gy in 33 fractions for 13%. Forty-two of the 46 patients went on to receive CRT, and the total concurrent cisplatin dose delivered was <200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 21 patients (46%) and >200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 25 patients (54%). In multivariate analysis of the 42 patients who received concurrent chemotherapy, the ability to deliver over 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> concurrent chemotherapy with radiation was not impacted by the dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, age, sex, ECOG, or ethnicity. Median follow-up was 2.6 years (0.17-10.6 years). Twenty-three percent of patients had a local recurrence, 13% developed distant metastases, and there were 7 deaths, 6 deaths due to NPC. The 3- year PFS was 67%, LRFS 74%, DMFS 86%, DSS 86%, and OS was 83%. Conclusion(s): NPC patients have been treated with NC at this center with favorable outcomes. Most patients tolerated CRT after NC, and half of patients received 5 or more concurrent cycles. The dose of NC given did not lower the dose concurrent chemotherapy later tolerated. This institution is currently evaluating the volumetric impact of NC on tumor size while we await the results of ongoing randomized trials of NC followed by CRT in this patient population.",Excluded
2524,"Quantitative characterization of nuclear overhauser enhancement and amide proton transfer effects in the human brain at 7 tesla PURPOSE: This study aimed to quantitatively investigate two main magnetization transfer effects at low B1: the nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) and amide proton transfer in the human brain at 7 T.METHODS: The magnetization transfer effects in the human brain were characterized using a four-pool proton model, which consisted of bulk water, macromolecules, an amide group of mobile proteins and peptides, and NOE-related protons resonating upfield. The pool sizes, exchange rates, and relaxation times of these proton pools were investigated quantitatively by fitting, and the net signals of amide proton transfer and NOE were simulated based on the fitted parameters.RESULTS: The results showed that the four-pool model fitted the experimental data quite well, and the NOE effects in human brain at 7 T had a broad spectrum distribution. The NOE effects peaked at a B1 of ~ 1-1.4 muT and were significantly stronger in the white matter than in the gray matter, corresponding to a pool-size ratio ~ 2:1. As the amide proton transfer effect was relatively small compared with the NOE effects, magnetization transfer asymmetry analysis yielded an NOE-dominated contrast in the healthy human brain in this range of B1.CONCLUSION: These findings are important to identify the source of NOE effects and to quantify amide proton transfer effects in human brain at 7 T.",Excluded

To begin investigating neurochemical mechanisms that may underlie the effects of fearful cue presentation, we measured release of [(3)H]-norepinephrine ([(3)H]-NE]) and [(14)C]-gamma-amino-butyric acid ([(14)C]-GABA) from brain regions known to regulate arousal states and REM sleep. Depolarization-evoked release of [(3)H]-NE from amygdalar slices of mice, which were trained to recognize a tone as a fearful cue, was suppressed at 2-3 h after exposure of animals to the fearful cue, but recovered after 4-5 h. Interestingly, depolarization-evoked release of [(14)C]-GABA was significantly increased in the amygdala, and also showed a tendency for enhancement in the hippocampus, NPO, and DRN at 2-3 h after cue presentation. The changes in [(14)C]-GABA release were also transient; 4-5 h after cue presentation no significant differences were detected between samples derived from experimental groups which experienced fearful or neutral cues. The similar time course of fearful cue-induced changes in neurotransmitter release and changes in arousal and REM sleep suggests that alterations in amygdalar neurotransmission may be involved in the changes in arousal and sleep that occur after fear.",Excluded

A chest wall structure was retrospectively defined on planning scans, and chest wall dosimetry and tumour-related factors recorded. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors predictive of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain.RESULTS: 182 patients and 187 tumours were included. There were 20 (10.9%) episodes of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that the maximum dose received by 1 cm(3) of chest wall (Dmax1 cm(3)) and tumour size were significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain [Dmax1 cm(3) odds ratio : 1.104, 95% confidence interval : 1.012-1.204, p = 0.025; tumour size (mm) odds ratio : 1.080, 95% confidence interval : 1.026-1.136, p = 0.003]. This model was an adequate fit to the data (Hosmer and Lemeshow test non-significant) and a fair discriminator for chest wall pain (area under receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.74). Using the multivariate logistic regression model, parameters for Dmax1 cm(3) are provided, which predict <10% and <20% risks of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain for different tumour sizes.CONCLUSION: Grade 2+ chest wall pain is an uncommon side effect of lung SABR. Larger tumour size and increasing Dmax1 cm(3) are significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. When planning lung SABR, it is prudent to try to avoid hot volumes in the chest wall, particularly for larger tumours.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This article demonstrates that Grade 2 or greater chest wall pain following lung SABR is more common when the tumour is larger in size and the Dmax1 cm(3) of the chest wall is higher. When planning lung SABR, the risk of chest wall pain may be reduced if maximum doses are minimized, particularly for larger tumours.",Excluded

3061,"Comparing survival predicted by the diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA) to actual survival in patients with 1-10 brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiple prognostic models for predicting survival after treatment for brain metastases have been developed. One of them, the diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA), has been developed to predict the median survival for brain metastases from the most frequent primary sites: lung carcinoma, breast cancer, melanoma, renal cell cancer and gastrointestinal tumours. In this study we aim to compare the survival predicted by the DS-GPA to actual survival, and to assess this models performance on both population and individual levels.METHODS: We identified a consecutive cohort of patients treated with SRS for brain metastases in our institute. DS-GPA scores were calculated for each patient, and the median survival for each DS-GPA group was calculated. Differences in survival between DS-GPA groups were tested with Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests and log-rank tests.RESULTS: In total 367 patients were included in the analysis. Median survival in our cohort is largely comparable to corresponding DS-GPA cohorts, but some notable differences are present. There was a significantly shorter median survival (15.4months, compared to 26.5months) in the adenocarcinoma NSCLC subgroup with a GPA score of 2.3-3. We confirmed the significant differences in survival time for most cancer-specific subgroups.CONCLUSION: DS-GPA seems to be a reliable tool to classify patients with brain metastases treated with SRS into prognostic subgroups. However, we found some aberrations from predicted median survival times, which may be due to specific characteristics of the populations of patients treated with SRS versus other patients.",Excluded

This case is well reproduced by ex-vivo samples of 90<sup>Y</sup>-marked Gastro-Entero-Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (GEP NET) in the bowel. These specimens indeed include at least three wide independent sources of background associated to three anatomical districts (mesentery, intestine, mucose). The study is based on the analysis of 37 lesions found on 5 samples belonging to 5 different patients. We show that the use of electrons, a short range particle, instead of gamma particles, allows to limit counts read on a lesion to the sum of the tumor signal plus the background generated by the sole hosting district. The background on adjacent districts in the same specimen/patient is found to differ up to a factor 4, showing how the specificity and sensitivity of the beta<sup>-</sup>-RGS technique can be fully exploited only upon a correct measurement of the contributing background. This locality has been used to set a site-specific cut-off algorithm to discriminate tumor and healthy tissue with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity, on this test data sample, close to 100%.

3026,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy using tomotherapy for single or multiple vertebral metastases Purpose/Objective(s): Conventional radiation therapy has been used to treat vertebral metastases (VM), but because of the dose constraint to the spinal cord, high enough doses to obtain long-term remission cannot necessarily be delivered. By using tomotherapy, the spinal cord dose can be lowered and higher doses can be delivered to VM. The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for single or multiple VM using tomotherapy. Materials/Methods: Between October 2010 and January 2012, 27 patients (primary cancer: gastrointestinal 6, urethral 5, prostate 5, lung 5, breast 3, others 3) with 32 VM (location: cervical 3, thoracic 18, lumber 11) were treated with SBRT as initial radiation therapy. All patients treated on this protocol had WHO performance status 0-2 and could keep position on an immobilization device for > 20 minutes. Before SBRT, 2- mm-thick CT and MR images were obtained and the tumor and neighboring vertebral structures were contoured as the clinical target volume (CTV). The planning target volume was CTV plus 5 mm. Either 40 Gy in 8 fractions or 48 Gy in 16 fractions were prescribed depending on Katagiri's prognostic index. The radiation dose to the spinal cord and other risk organs were reduced to the tolerance levels using intensity modulation. One to 4 lesions in consecutive vertebrae were treated in one course of SBRT. Radiological (CT and/or MRI) and physical examinations were performed at 1-3 month intervals after SBRT. Birthel index (BI), numerical rating scale (NRS) and the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria ver 4.0 were used to evaluate activities of daily living (ADL), pain and toxicity. Result(s): Treatment times were within 15-20 minutes. A median followup period was 5 months (range, 1-14). Compared to pretreatment status, the majority of VM patients (29/32) had prompt pain relief within 4 weeks after SBRT. The NRS significantly dropped at 1 month after SBRT (4.0 +/- 0.8 [SE] vs. 1.0 +/- 0.2, p < 0.0001) and the effect continued over 2 months. Significant BI decrease was not observed at 2 months after SBRT (84 +/- 16 vs. 86 +/- 18, p = 0.7). BI decrease resulting from VM enlargement was observed in only 2 patients. They occurred during SBRT course and 9 months after SBRT, respectively. One Grade 3 dermatitis developed at 3 months after SBRT. One patient had Grade 2 ileus and 2 had Grade 1 neuralgia, although direct association with SBRT was not clear. No pneumonitis was observed in 18 patients with thoracic VM. No grade > 2 neurologic toxicity resulting from SBRT was observed. Conclusion(s): This is the first report on successful SBRT for bone metastases in up to 4 consecutive vertebrae using tomotherapy. Good ADL control and palliation of pain were achieved with acceptable toxicity by SBRT using tomotherapy.",Excluded
2445,"Mechanical stress models of Alzheimer's disease pathology Introduction Extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta protein and intracellular accumulation of tau in brain tissues have been described in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mechanical stress-based diseases of different mechanisms, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), arterial hypertension (HTN), and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Methods We provide a brief overview of experimental models of TBI, HTN, and NPH showing features of tau-amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss. Results ""Alzheimer-like"" hallmarks found in these mechanical stress-based models were compared with AD features found in transgenic models. Discussion The goal of this review is, therefore, to build on current concepts of onset and progression of AD lesions. We point to the importance of accumulated mechanical stress in brain as an environmental and endogenous factor that pushes protein deposition and neuronal injury over the disease threshold. We further encourage the development of preventing strategies and drug screening based on mechanical stress models. Copyright © 2016 The Alzheimer's Association.",Excluded
2696,"Low serum 25 (OH) vitamin D level is associated with increased risk of primary CNS malignancy: A retrospective cohort study in a veteran population BACKGROUND: Vitamin D (VitD) deficiency has been reported to be associated with numerous malignancies, presumed to be secondary to its action through VitD receptor, immune and cell cycle regulation. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the relationship between VitD (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D]) levels and primary brain malignancy. METHOD(S): We conducted a retrospective cohort study of veterans who received care through VHA from January 2000 to December 2015 and had their VitD levels measured at least once over the course of their care. Primary outcome measure was the incidence of primary brain malignancy in relation to VitD levels. Exclusion criteria included diagnoses of metastatic brain cancer, meningeal, spinal, face, neck and throat malignancies; VitD measurements in the months of November to February; exposure to ionizing radiation; and presence of genetic factors predisposing to brain tumors formation. Propensity score matching and survival analyses were conducted on the cohorts to determine and compare the incidence and hazard ratios for brain malignancy between two groups of subjects. Group 1: subjects with VitD levels higher than 20 ng/ml; and Group 2: subjects with VitD deficiency defined as <= 20ng/ml. Kaplan Meier curves were plotted to compare the time to events between the groups. RESULT(S): After matching the two groups on several confounders (Age, Gender, BMI, Smoking Status, Alcohol Abuse, Race, Ethnicity), the incidence of primary brain malignancy was significantly higher in Group 2 (384/251,636; 154 per 100,000) in comparison with Group 1 (992/694,707; 143 per 100,000). VitD deficiency was associated with higher risk of primary brain malignancy (HR 1.129, CI [1.004 -1.269] p <0.05). Kaplan Meier analysis showed subjects with vitamin D had lower probability of survival free from primary brain malignancy that was statistically significant. CONCLUSION(S): Findings from this study suggests increased risk of primary brain malignancy in subjects with VitD deficiency.",Excluded
3550,"Anti-apoptotic and antioxidant effects of low dose gamma irradiation against diabetes-induced brain injury in rats The current study aimed to investigate the effect of different low doses of gamma irradiation on hyperglycemia-induced brain injury. The aim was further extended to investigate the sub-chronic effect of low dose radiation on the neuronal damage induced by diabetes. To induce diabetes, male albino rats were injected with dexamethasone (10 mg/kg/day, for 9 successive days, subcutaneously). Different diabetic groups were irradiated with 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 Gy. The effect of low dose gamma irradiation on the hyperglycemia-induced brain damage based was analyzed at two levels: oxidative stress and apoptosis. The brain contents of glutathione, malondialdhyde and total nitrate/nitrite were measured to assess the oxidative stress. In order to evaluate the extent of the apoptotic changes in brain, tissue caspase-3 expression was detected using immunohistochemistry and the degree of DNA fragmentation was estimated. Moreover, brain tissues were examined using light microscopy to evaluate the histological changes in different groups and serum lactate dehydrogenase activity was determined as an indicator for the brain tissue damage. Results indicated that exposure to 0.5 Gy ameliorated the hyperglycemia and subsequently inhibited oxidative stress and apoptosis. Radiation exposure at this dose level also increased the survival rate of diabetic animals.",Excluded
3147,"Interfractional setup error and intrafractional bladder motion during radiation therapy for bladder tumors Purpose/Objective(s): To estimate planning margins based on interfractional setup error and intrafractional bladder motion during radiation therapy for bladder tumors by using the real-time tumor-tracking radiation therapy (RTRT) system with fiducial gold markers for the positioning. Materials/Methods: We analyzed 151 sessions in 19 patients with bladder tumors who had received radiation therapy with a localized boost using the RTRT system and fiducial markers for positioning from 1999 to 2011. Up to six gold markers were transurethrally implanted into the bladder wall around the tumor bed after the transurethral tumor reduction and 40-Gy pelvic irradiation. After the manual setup using skin marks, the coordinates of the center of gravity of fiducial markers were measured at the start of treatment and during irradiation. The table position was adjusted to the planned position if the discrepancy was larger than 2.0 mm along the cranial-caudal (CC), left-right (LR), or anterior-posterior (AP) direction. Using the position at the start of radiation dose delivery as the reference position, we analyzed the interfractional setup error and intrafractional error due to bladder motion. Result(s): The overall number of sessions in which table adjustments were required was 108 (71.5%) for pretreatment offsets and 38 (25.2%) for offsets after the initiation of radiation therapy. The number of table adjustments in a session ranged from 0 to 4, and more than two adjustments were required in 7 sessions involving 5 patients. To guarantee that 90% of patients in the population receive a minimum cumulative clinical target volume (CTV) dose of at least 95% of the prescribed dose, the setup margin (SM) was 14.5 mm, 9.6 mm, and 10.6 mm along the CC, LR, and AP directions, respectively. The internal margin (IM) calculated from offsets at the end of irradiation was 2.6 mm, 2.1 mm, and 2.1 mm, and number of sessions in which the length of required table adjustment was greater than the calculated IM after the initial setup was 12 (7.9%), 14 (9.3%), and 17 (11.3%), and the average time interval (range, standard deviation) between the initiation of radiation therapy and the table adjustment greater than the calculated IM was 4.2 (0.2-15.0, 5.2) minutes, 5.6 (0.2-14.7, 5.0) minutes, 4.4 (0.2-14.7, 3.9) minutes along these directions, respectively. Conclusion(s): In contrast to a large SM based on skin marks, the positioning procedure of the RTRT system with fiducial markers is useful to reduce the planning target volume substantially. Considering that the incidence of table adjustment greater than the calculated IM was about 10% and that the interval time was highly variable, the table adjustment based on the on-line imaging has an advantage in detecting unexpected internal organ movement.",Excluded

2989,"[Role of radiotherapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma] BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice in multiple myeloma; but there are no curative options. Therefore, the treatment rationale is characterized by reduction of symptoms and inhibition of complications. Regarding reduction of pain, treatment of (impending) fractures, and spinal cord compression radiation is an important part of palliative treatment. In our retrospective study we report the effect of radiotherapy on reduction of pain, recalcification and the reduction of neurological symptoms and evaluate factors which have an impact on therapeutic outcome.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1, Jan 1988 to 31, Dec 1998, 42 patients (19 women, 23 men; range of ages 46 to 85 years, median age 64.9 years) with 71 target volumes were irradiated (median dose 36 Gy, 2 to 3 Gy 5 times/week) because of symptomatic disease (67/71: osseous pain, 45/71: fractures/impending fractures, 13/71: spinal cord compression) (Tables 1 and 2). The median time from diagnosis to the first course of radiotherapy was 11.9 months (0.3 to 90 months). At the time of first irradiation, 5 and 37 patients were in tumor Stage II and III (Salmon/Durie), respectively. The median value of the Karnofsky performance was 70% (40 to 90%).RESULTS: During follow-up (at least 6 months) in 85% of target volumes complete and partial pain relief (measured by patients' perception and the use of analgetic medication) was achieved; recurrences were seen in 8.8%. In 26/56 (46.4%) lesions evaluable a recalcification was seen whereas 17.9% showed progressive disease (comparison of radiographs before and after radiation). In 22.3% of all lesions initially with impending fracture (4/18) radiotherapy failed because of fracture after treatment (Tables 3 and 4). Simultaneous chemotherapy and a Karnofsky performance > or = 70 had a significant impact on a positive response to treatment, respectively. Spinal cord compression symptoms were reduced in 7/13 (53.8%) of patients (scaled due to the classification by Findlay 1987). The median survival from diagnosis for the entire group was 34.9 months (7.5 to 119.3 months), after irradiation 13.1 months (0.2 to 105.3 months) (Figure 1).CONCLUSION: When adequately indicated radiotherapy has shown to be an effective palliative treatment. Taking under consideration that the results are retrospective we suppose that in multiple myeloma the local response to radiation is supported by a favorable performance status and simultaneous chemotherapy. Irradiation treatment does not change prognosis regarding overall survival.",Excluded

2615,"Prescription ISO-energy is a strong predictor of symptomatic adverse radiation effect in stereotactic radiosurgery of brain metastases Purpose/Objective(s): In this study, we aim to 1) determine whether a new parameter named prescription iso-energy (PIE) correlates with the development of symptomatic adverse radiation effect (ARE) after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of brain metastases and 2) compare PIE with known dosimetric prognostic parameters for ARE such as the 10 and 12-Gy isodose volume. Materials/Methods: The PIE is simply defined as the product of the prescription dose in Gy (joule/kg, equivalent to mJ/mL of tissue) and the prescription isodose volume in mL. The senior radiation oncologist of the study (PKS) had previously reviewed and scored outcome (no failure/ no ARE, failure, asymptomatic vs symptomatic ARE, and indeterminate cases of lesion enlargement) after SRS at our institution from 1998-2009 for 2,200 brain metastases with at least 3 months of imaging follow-up. For this analysis, we considered the 1,640 metastases treated with SRS alone, or SRS after previous whole-brain radiation therapy, for which there was no coalescence of 50% of prescription dose-volume with that of any nearby metastasis. A logistic regression model was then developed to correlate the incidence of symptomatic ARE with a series of parameters that included PIE and peripheral isodose volumes such as 8-Gy to 12-Gy isodose volume, scoring symptomatic ARE as 2, indeterminate cases as 1, and remaining outcomes as 0 (no failure and no ARE, failure, or asymptomatic ARE). Result(s): There were 50 cases of symptomatic ARE in this subset. Marginal levels of significance were achieved when correlating the incidence of symptomatic ARE with peripheral isodose volumes. For example, using 12-Gy isodose volume, the logistically regressed slope was 0.828 +/- 0.429 (P =.082) with a 95% confidence interval of -0.127-1.782, in which the zero slope value cannot be directly rejected from the model. In contrast, PIE (in the units of mJ or Gy-mL) was found to be highly significant in correlating with the incidence of symptomatic ARE, yielding a positive slope value of 1.264 +/- 0.275 (P =.0003) with a 95% confidence interval of 0.681-1.848. The adjusted R2 and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were also significantly improved for PIE versus 12-Gy isodose volume (R2 = 0.88 vs 0.77 and jBICj = 33 vs 21, respectively). Based on the PIE results, functional curves were derived that enable a user to evaluate risk of symptomatic ARE when prescribing a dose to various target volumes. Conclusion(s): Analysis of >1,500 brain metastases treated with SRS has demonstrated that PIE is strongly predicative of developing symptomatic ARE, correlating more strongly with risk of ARE than 10 or 12-Gy volume.",Excluded
3390,"Comparison of different radiation types and irradiation geometries in stereotactic radiosurgery Recent interest in stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial lesions, and the development of stereotactic irradiation techniques has led to the need for a systematic and complete comparison of these methods. A method for conducting these comparisons is proposed and is applied to a set of currently-used stereotactic radiosurgical techniques. Three-dimensional treatment planning calculations are used to compare dose distributions for several different radiation types and irradiation geometries. Calculations were performed using charged particles (H, He, C, and Ne ions) and the irradiation geometry currently used at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Photons in the Gamma Knife configuration and the Heidelberg Linac arc method are used. The 3-dimensional dose distributions were evaluated by means of dose-volume histograms and integral doses to the target volume and to normal brain. The effects of target volume, shape and location are studied. The charged particle dose distributions are more favorable than those of the photon methods. The differences between charged particles and photons increase with increasing target volume. The differences between different charged particle species are small, as are the effects of target shape and location.",Excluded
3086,"Survivin a radiogenetic promoter for glioblastoma viral gene therapy independently from CArG motifs BACKGROUND: Radiogenetic therapy is a novel approach in the treatment of cancer, which employs genetic modification to alter the sensitivity of tumor cells to the effect of applied radiation.AIM: To select a potent radiation inducible promoter in the context of brain tumors and to investigate if CArG radio responsive motifs or other elements in the promoter nucleotide sequences can correlate to its response to radiation.METHODS: To select initial candidates for promoter inducible elements, the levels of mRNA expression of six different promoters were assessed using Quantitative RTPCR in D54 MG cells before and after radiation exposure. Recombinant Ad/reporter genes driven by five different promoters; CMV, VEGF, FLT-1, DR5 and survivin were constructed. Glioma cell lines were infected with different multiplicity of infection of the (promoter) Ad or CMV Ad. Cells were then exposed to a range of radiation (0-12 Gy) at single fraction. Fluorescent microscopy, Luc assay and X-gal staining was used to detect the level of expression of related genes. Different glioma cell lines and normal astrocytes were infected with Ad survivin and exposed to radiation. The promoters were analyzed for presence of CArG radio-responsive motifs and CCAAT box consensus using NCBI blast bioinformatics software.RESULTS: Radiotherapy increases the expression of gene expression by 1.25-2.5 fold in different promoters other than survivin after 2 h of radiation. RNA analysis was done and has shown an increase in copy number of tenfold for survivin. Most importantly cells treated with RT and Ad Luc driven by survivin promoter showed a fivefold increase in expression after 2 Gy of radiation in comparison to non-irradiated cells. Presence or absence of CArG motifs did not correlate with promoter response to radiation. Survivin with the best response to radiation had the lowest number of CCAAT box.CONCLUSION: Survivin is a selective potent radiation inducible promoter for glioblastoma viral gene therapy and this response to radiation could be independent of CArG motifs.",Excluded
3031,"Single domain antibody (SBT-100) crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and inhibits human glioblastoma by selectively targeting KRAS and P-STAT3 Background: Glioblastoma is difficult to treat malignancy that has a high incidence of KRAS mutations ( > 90%) and hyper-expression of P-STAT3 ( > 90%). Most chemotherapeutic agents and large biologics (four chain heterotetrameric IgG) cannot cross the BBB. Therefore Singh Biotechnology's (SBT) propriety technology has developed a novel targeted therapy and engineered SBT-100 a 15 kD single domain antibody (sdAb) that is bispecific for KRAS and STAT3, which can cross the BBB to target gliablastomas. Method(s): Human glioblastoma (U87MG) cell line was used and obtained from ATCC. Biacore affinity assay was used to demonstrate SBT-100 binding to KRAS, KRAS (G12D), and STAT3. The glioblastoma cells were incubated with 0ug/ml to 200ug/ml of SBT-100. MTT assay was performed after 3 days of treatment with SBT-100 and the growth inhibition was calculated. Xenograft (athymic nude mouse) with a well established tumor growing for 6 weeks was injected with SBT-100 intraperitoneally (IP). After 15 minutes the brain of this animal was harvested for immunohistochemical staining. Result(s): Biacore studies showed SBT-100 binds KRAS with affinity constant of 10- 9M, KRAS (G12D) at 10- 8M, and STAT3 at 10- 8M. MTT assay reveals 62% (p < 0.01) growth inhibition of U87MG within 3 days. A xenograft mouse with a well established tumor ( > 150mm<sup>3</sup>), when injected IP with 5mg/kg of SBT-100 showed localization in the brain within 15 minutes. Therefore SBT-100 (sdAb) crosses the BBB, and shows intracellular localization in the animal's neurons and glial cells. Conclusion(s): SBT-100 significantly inhibits the growth of glioblastoma. KRAS mutations and/or over expression of P-STAT3 in glioblastomas are promising targets for sdAbs like SBT-100, which is bispecific for KRAS and STAT3. SBT-100 crosses the BBB and localizes within the neurons and glial cells of the brain. SBT's proprietary single domain antibody technology platform used to engineer SBT- 100 holds promise for targeting primary brain malignancies, metastatic cancers that go to the brain, and for neurologic disease amenable to targeted therapy. Many chemo-resistant and radiation-resistant cancers use STAT3 as an escape mechanism.",Excluded

3187,"Cerenkov luminescence imaging with PET probes for brain function analysis Objectives Optical imaging has advantages in its easy-to-use feature. However, brain imaging is not easy in optical molecular imaging, since the molecular sizes of fluorescent probes are usually too large to penetrate the bloodbrain- barrier. On the other hands, PET imaging is superior in quantitative analysis, and many brain imaging probes are available. Cerenkov radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle (such as a positron) passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium. Here, we evaluated the feasibility of CLI for the analysis of brain functions using [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG, [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride and [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT. Methods For [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG imaging, the mice were separated into two groups. For one group, the hair of the mice were shaved (w/o hair), and for other group, the skull was additionally removed (w/o hair & skull). [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG (3 MBq, iv) was injected to each group of the mice, and PET imaging was performed from 30 to 60 min after the injection. Then, Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) was done for 10 min from just after the PET imaging. After in vivo CLI, the brain was removed and ex vivo CLI was performed. Then, the radioactivity of the brain was measured by a gamma-counter. Various fasting times were set for each mouse in order to produce various blood sugar levels. For [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride imaging, the mice (w/o hair) were injected with 7.4 MBq of the tracer, and sequential 8-min CLI (followed by 2-min interval) was performed from 8-10 min after the injection. In vivo blocking study was done by treating the mice with haloperidol. Also, the images were obtained by [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT. Results In [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG studies, there was a good relationship between the radioactivity and CLI signal in removed brains (r=0.93). The good correlation was observed in w/o hair & skull group (r=0.92). The correlation was weaker in w/o hair group (r=0.74), but it thought to be acceptable for the analysis in mice. The striatum was successfully visualized by [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride and [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT. Luminescence in the striatum was decreased by haloperidol treatment. Since the brain uptake of [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT was higher than [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride, [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT produced more clearer images in CLI. Conclusions Optical imaging was possible with PET imaging probes. Although both quantitativity and sensitivity are inferior to PET imaging, it is possible to use CRI for brain function analysis in mice.",Excluded

2653,"The efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy for metastases from renal cell carcinoma Our purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for intracranial and extracranial metastases in patients with renal cell carcinoma. The retrospective analysis of 85 patients (151 tumors) treated with SRT was performed. SRT was the sole treatment in 35% of tumors, the other 65% had received additional treatment such as surgery, palliative radiotherapy, immunotherapy or chemotherapy. In 60% and 40% of patients SRT was delivered to brain and extracranial lesions, respectively. The assessment of the efficacy of SRT was based on a radiological imaging (Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and estimation of Local Control (LC) as well as Overall Survival (OS). Single fraction was used for 104 tumors and fractionated treatment for 47 tumors. The crude LC for evaluable lesions was 81%, stratified by tumor location: brain LC=94%, extracranial tumors LC=70% (p=0.049). The median OS was 9.4 months; 1-year and 2-year OS were 40% and 29%, respectively. The additional treatment did not lead to a better local response (p=0,543), but resulted in a benefit in OS (7 vs 13 months, p=0,01). A positive relationship between the biologically effective dose (BED) and local response was noted, but the BED was influenced by a tumor volume (R=-0,38; p<0,00001). The presence of multi-organ metastases reduced the OS rate (8.7 vs 19.1 months; p=0,01). The interval between the diagnosis of the metastasis and its treatment with SRT was inversely related to OS (P=0.0001). SRT results in a good local response, which is more beneficial for brain than extracranial lesions. The local efficacy of the SRT depends on the radiation dose. Multidisciplinary treatment and earlier application of SRT improves the prognosis of patients. Copyright © 2016, Cancer Research Institute Slovak Acad. of Sciences. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3082,"Diminished neuronal activity increases neuron-neuron connectivity underlying silent synapse formation and the rapid conversion of silent to functional synapses Neuronal activity regulates the synaptic strength of neuronal networks. However, it is still unclear how diminished activity changes connection patterns in neuronal circuits. To address this issue, we analyzed neuronal connectivity and relevant mechanisms using hippocampal cultures in which developmental synaptogenesis had occurred. We show that diminution of network activity in mature neuronal circuit promotes reorganization of neuronal circuits via NR2B subunit-containing NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NR2B-NMDARs), which mediate silent synapse formation. Simultaneous double whole-cell recordings revealed that diminishing neuronal circuit activity for 48 h increased the number of synaptically connected neuron pairs with both silent and functional synapses. This increase was accompanied by the specific expression of NR2B-NMDARs at synaptic sites. Analysis of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) showed that the frequency of NMDAR-mediated, but not AMPAR-mediated, mEPSCs increased, indicating that diminished neuronal activity promotes silent synapse formation via the surface delivering NR2B-NMDARs in mature neurons. After activation of neuronal circuit by releasing from TTX blockade (referred as circuit reactivation), the frequency of AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs increased instead, and this increase was prevented by ifenprodil. The circuit reactivation also caused an increased colocalization of glutamate receptor 1-specfic and synaptic NR2B-specific puncta. These results indicate that the circuit reactivation converts rapidly silent synapses formed during activity suppression to functional synapses. These data may provide a new example of homeostatic circuit plasticity that entails the modulation of neuron-neuron connectivity by synaptic activity.",Excluded
3357,"YKL-40 expression is associated with poorer response to radiation and shorter overall survival in glioblastoma PURPOSE: YKL-40 is a secreted protein that has been reported to be overexpressed in epithelial cancers and gliomas, although its function is unknown. Previous data in a smaller sample set suggested that YKL-40 was a marker associated with a poorer clinical outcome and a genetically defined subgroup of glioblastoma. Here we test these findings in a larger series of patients with glioblastoma, and in particular, determine if tumor YKL-40 expression is associated with radiation response.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients (n=147) with subtotal resections were studied for imaging-assessed changes in tumor size in serial studies following radiation therapy. An additional set (n=140) of glioblastoma patients who underwent a gross-total resection was tested to validate the survival association and extend them to patients with minimal residual disease.RESULTS: In the subtotal resection group, higher YKL-40 expression was significantly associated with poorer radiation response, shorter time to progression and shorter overall survival. The association of higher YKL-40 expression with poorer survival was validated in the gross-total resection group. In multivariate analysis with both groups combined (n = 287), YKL-40 was an independent predictor of survival after adjusting for patient age, performance status, and extent of resection. YKL-40 expression was also compared with genetically defined subsets of glioblastoma by assessing epidermal growth factor receptor amplification and loss at chromosome 10q, two of the common recurring aberrations in these tumors, using fluorescent in situ hybridization. YKL-40 was significantly associated with 10q loss.CONCLUSIONS: The findings implicate YKL-40 as an important marker of therapeutic response and genetic subtype in glioblastomas and suggest that it may play an oncogenic role in these tumors.",Included

Optic neuropathy was diagnosed by an observer masked as to clinical and photographic data. We analyzed planimetry area measurements of the retrobulbar nerve before and after irradiation. The retrobulbar area of the optic nerve shadow on B-scan was quantitated with a sonic digitizer. Increased optic nerve shadow area was confirmed in 13 of 15 patients who had radiation optic neuropathy (P less than .004). The correct diagnosis was confirmed when the results of ultrasound were compared to fundus photography and fluorescein angiography. In 13 patients there was acute radiation optic neuropathy. Two patients did not show an enlarged retrobulbar optic nerve, and the clinical appearance suggested early progression to optic atrophy.

3362,"Endovascular treatment of superior vena cava syndrome: What you need to know before you start Background: Malignancy is the major etiologic factor of SVCS. Medical treatment, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are dependent on the histological type and provide clinical relief for a short duration with high recurrence rate. Revascularization by EVT comprising angioplasty and stent placement is the first-line treatment. Clinical Findings/Procedure: Pictorial review of 200 treated patients. Orthopnea and edema of the upper body are the main symptoms but respiratory distress, convulsions, or coma due to cerebral edema are also described. Main causes are tumor invasion (60%-97%) with bronchopulmonary cancers being the most common (60%-90%) followed by lymphomas (6%-25%) and metastases. The tumor may be treated with radiation or chemotherapy, with efficacy rates up to 94% and 77%, respectively, but this varies with histologic types. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia and femoral venous access alone is used when possible. Brachial or jugular approaches can be used if dual venous access is required. From our experience, self-expandable stents outperform balloonexpandable stents and thrombolysis may be used before or after stent placement in cases of severe obstruction or stent thrombosis.

3428,"Integration of the heart rhythmogenesis levels: heart rhythm generator in the brain We propose that along with the intracardiac pacemaker, a generator of cardiac rhythm exists in the central nervous system--in the efferent structures of the cardiovascular center of the medullar oblongata. Signals in the medulla oblongata arise as a result of the hierarchic interaction of the brain structures. Neural signals originating there in the form of bursts of impulses conduct to the heart along the vagus nerves and after interaction with cardiac pacemaker structures, cause generation of the cardiac pulse in exact accordance with the frequency of ""neural bursts"". The intrinsic cardiac rhythm generator (the sinus node) is a life-sustaining factor that maintains the heart pumping function when the central nervous system is in a stage of deep inhibition, (e.g., under anesthesia or during unconsciousness). The brain generator is the factor that provides heart adaptive reactions in behaving organism. The integration of the two levels of rhythmogenesis in the brain and heart provides reliability and functional perfection of the cardiac rhythm generation system in the whole organism.",Excluded
2917,"Bnct combined with early successive bevacizumab treatments for recurrent malignant gliomas INTRODUCTION: Recurrent malignant gliomas (RMGs) are difficult to control. We have often treated RMGs using tumor-selective particle radiation called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). However, despite the cell-selectivity of BNCT, brain radiation necrosis (BRN) may develop. This is partly due to the full-dose X-ray treatments usually given earlier in the treatment course. To overcome BRN, we herein used extended BV treatment beginning just after BNCT, and evaluated the feasibility, efficacy, and BRN control of this combination treatment. METHOD(S): Two cohorts were included. The first and second cohorts were treated with BNCT between June 2013 and May 2014, and between August 2017 and December 2017, respectively. They were followed by successive BV treatments. The first cohort was composed of 7 patients with RMGs (4 grade 4 and 3 grade 3 cases). The second cohort was composed of 6 patients with RMGs (5 grade 4 and 1 grade 3 cases). They were followed-up to April 2018. RESULT(S): Median OS and PFS after combination treatment were 15.1 and 5.4 months, respectively in the 1st cohort. Those in the second cohort were not reached. The OS data was compared with RPA classification for RMG as advocated by Carson et al. in a 2007 article in JCO. In both cohorts no symptomatic aggravation of BRN occurred if BV could be continued. CTCAE grade 2 and 3 proteinuria occurred in two cases and necessitated the interruption of BV treatments. Totally 11cases' OS in both cohorts were compared using JCO's RPA classification. Nine out of 11 cases showed longer OS in comparison with corresponding JCO's RPA classes. CONCLUSION(S): BNCT followed by BV treatments well-prevented or well-controlled BRN with prolonged OS and acceptable incidence of adverse events in our patients with RMG.",Excluded

2775,"Gamma Knife surgery for adrenocorticotropic hormone-producing pituitary adenomas after bilateral adrenalectomy OBJECT: Patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenomas may require a bilateral adrenalectomy to treat their Cushing's disease. Approximately one third of these patients, however, will experience progressive enlargement of the residual pituitary adenoma, develop hyperpigmentation, and have an elevated level of serum ACTH. These patients with Nelson's syndrome can be treated with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS).METHODS: The prospectively collected University of Virginia Gamma Knife database of patients with pituitary adenomas was reviewed to identify all individuals with Nelson's syndrome who were treated with GKS. Twenty-three patients with a minimum of 6 months of follow up were identified in the database. These patients were assessed for tumor control (that is, lack of tumor growth over time) with neuroimaging studies (median follow-up duration 22 months) and for biochemical normalization of their ACTH levels (median follow-up duration 50 months). Neuroimaging follow-up studies were available for 22 patients, and endocrine follow up was available for 15 patients in whom elevation of ACTH levels was documented prior to GKS. In the 22 patients in whom neuroimaging follow-up studies were available, 12 had a decrease in tumor size, eight had no tumor growth, and two had an increase in tumor volume. Ten of 15 patients with elevated ACTH levels prior to GKS showed a decrease in their ACTH levels at last follow up; three of these 10 patients achieved normal ACTH levels (< 50 pg/ml) and the other five patients with initially elevated values had an increase in ACTH levels. Ten patients were thoroughly evaluated for post-GKS pituitary function; four were found to have new pituitary hormone deficiency and six did not have hypopituitarism after GKS. One patient suffered a permanent third cranial nerve palsy and four patients are now deceased.CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery may control the residual pituitary adenoma and decrease ACTH levels in patients with Nelson's syndrome. Delayed hypopituitarism or cranial nerve palsies can occur after GKS. Patients with Nelson's syndrome require continued multidisciplinary follow-up care. Given the difficulties associated with management of Nelson's syndrome, even the modest results of GKS may be helpful for a number of patients.",Excluded

3134,"Photic and circadian regulation of melatonin production in the Mozambique tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus Diverse circadian systems related to phylogeny and ecological adaptive strategies are proposed in teleosts. Recently, retinal photoreception was reported to be important for the circadian pacemaking activities of the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus. We aimed to confirm the photic and circadian responsiveness of its close relative-the Mozambique tilapia O. mossambicus. Melatonin production in cannulated or ophthalmectomized fish and its secretion from cultured pineal glands were examined under several light regimes. Melatonin production in the cannulated tilapias was measured at 3-h intervals; it fluctuated daily, with a nocturnal increase and a diurnal decrease. Exposing the cannulated fish to several light intensities (1500-0.1 lx) and to natural light (0.1 and 0.3 lx) suppressed melatonin levels within 30 min. Static pineal gland culture under light-dark and reverse light-dark cycles revealed that melatonin synthesis increased during the dark periods. Rhythmic melatonin synthesis disappeared on pineal gland culture under constant dark and light conditions. After ophthalmectomy, plasma melatonin levels did not vary with light-dark cycles. These results suggest that (1) Mozambique tilapias possess strong photic responsiveness, (2) their pineal glands are sensitive to light but lack circadian pacemaker activity, and (3) they require lateral eyes for rhythmic melatonin secretion from the pineal gland.",Excluded

3588,"A novel specific application of pyruvate protects the mouse retina against white light damage: differential stabilization of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha PURPOSE: To mimic hypoxia preconditioning by a novel specific pyruvate treatment and to study its retinal protection against white light damage.METHODS: Six-to-eight-week-old BALB/c mice were exposed to strong white light calculated to produce photoreceptor degeneration. Some were given injections of pyruvate in a preordained protocol because evidence exists that proves pyruvate can affect the concentration of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to determine the concentration of proteins and mRNAs in retinas. Morphology was analyzed with toluidine blue staining and was plotted using a spidergraph. A free nucleosome cell death assay was used to examine apoptosis. Retina explant cultures were used to investigate the background mechanism.RESULTS: Pyruvate administration stabilized hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha but not HIF-2alpha. Expression of the downstream genes hemoxygenase-1 and erythropoietin mirrored the changes of the two HIFs, respectively. Importantly, pyruvate given not only before but also after exposure to light protected photoreceptors against apoptosis. In the retinal explant system, addition or depletion of pyruvate caused only changes of HIF-1alpha and prolyl hydroxylase (PHD)-2, while HIF-2alpha and PHD1 were not affected. However, under hypoxic conditions, HIF-2alpha was stabilized by pyruvate but not HIF-1alpha.CONCLUSIONS: Pyruvate evoked a hypoxia-like response under normoxic conditions and was retina-protective against strong white light. This response included stabilization of HIF-1alpha but not HIF-2alpha. This differential stabilization might be related to the distinct preference of their degrading enzyme of PHD2 and PHD1 in response to pyruvate treatment.",Excluded
2868,"Prox1-positive cells monitor and sustain the murine intestinal epithelial cholinergic niche The enteric neurotransmitter acetylcholine governs important intestinal epithelial secretory and immune functions through its actions on epithelial muscarinic Gq-coupled receptors such as M3R. Its role in the regulation of intestinal stem cell function and differentiation, however, has not been clarified. Here, we find that nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonism in mice as well as epithelial-specific ablation of M3R induces a selective expansion of DCLK1-positive tuft cells, suggesting a model of feedback inhibition. Cholinergic blockade reduces Lgr5-positive intestinal stem cell tracing and cell number. In contrast, Prox1-positive endocrine cells appear as primary sensors of cholinergic blockade inducing the expansion of tuft cells, which adopt an enteroendocrine phenotype and contribute to increased mucosal levels of acetylcholine. This compensatory mechanism is lost with acute irradiation injury, resulting in a paucity of tuft cells and acetylcholine production. Thus, enteroendocrine tuft cells appear essential to maintain epithelial homeostasis following modifications of the cholinergic intestinal niche. Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
3016,"Indirect adaptive soft computing based wavelet-embedded control paradigms for WT/PV/SOFC in a grid/charging station connected hybrid power system This paper focuses on the indirect adaptive tracking control of renewable energy sources in a grid-connected hybrid power system. The renewable energy systems have low efficiency and intermittent nature due to unpredictable meteorological conditions. The domestic load and the conventional charging stations behave in an uncertain manner. To operate the renewable energy sources efficiently for harvesting maximum power, instantaneous nonlinear dynamics should be captured online. A Chebyshev-wavelet embedded NeuroFuzzy indirect adaptive MPPT (maximum power point tracking) control paradigm is proposed for variable speed wind turbine-permanent synchronous generator (VSWT-PMSG). A Hermite-wavelet incorporated NeuroFuzzy indirect adaptive MPPT control strategy for photovoltaic (PV) system to extract maximum power and indirect adaptive tracking control scheme for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) is developed. A comprehensive simulation test-bed for a grid-connected hybrid power system is developed in Matlab/Simulink. The robustness of the suggested indirect adaptive control paradigms are evaluated through simulation results in a grid-connected hybrid power system test-bed by comparison with conventional and intelligent control techniques.

3055,"Brain MRI characteristics and scoring in adult onset krabbe disease Introduction: Krabbe disease is a recessively inherited lysosomal storage disease due to decreased galactocerebrosidase activity. Adult onset is rare, however probably underdiagnosed. Brain MRI showing a leukodystrophy is of great value to achieve diagnosis. We aimed at performing for the first time a systematic analysis of brainMRI features in adult onset Krabbe disease (>10 years old). Method(s): We collected the first available brain MRI of patients seen in the reference center for lysosomal diseases. We also contacted authors of published articles describing adult onset Krabbe disease patients and ask them to share brain MRI data. A score was established to describe the brain MRIs, with quantification according to severity (from 0 to 4 for nonfascicular structures and from 0 to 2 for fascicular structures). Two neuroradiologists first scored separately the MRIs, then reached a consensus for final scoring. Result(s): Thirteen patients were included in the study. Pyramidal tract was the most frequent structure showing abnormal T2 hypersignal (100% of patients), however with some distinctions along the tractus: medial precentral gyrus (100% of patients, mean score 2.8/4), lateral precentral gyrus (77%, 1.77/4), and corona radiata (100%, 1.7/2) were highly abnormal whereas internal capsula (69%, 0.96/2), mesencephalon (46%, 0.69/2), pons (31%, 0.42/2), and spinal bulb (0%, 0/2) were quite spared. Other sus tentorial white matter (WM) localizations were also found abnormal: occipital WM (92%, 2.15/ 4), optic radiations (69%, mean score 1.03/2), frontalWM(69%, 1.5/4), temporal WM (61%, 1.15/4), and parietal WM (15%, 0.23/4). 9/13 patients (69%) had corpus callosum hypersignal especially in isthmus (69%, mean score 1.38/2), body (38%, 0.77/2), and splenium (31%, 0.61/2), whereas genu was always normal. Finally, medial lemniscus was the most frequent abnormal structure found in posterior fossa (9/13 patients, 69%, mean score 0.96/2).

As with ionizing radiation, no defect has been observed in the overall rejoining of single or double-strand breaks produced by bleomycin. Since, however, only apyrimidinic (and to a lesser extent apurinic) sites and strand breaks are known to be produced by bleomycin, we tentatively suggest that AT cells are unable to rejoin a very small fraction of the total strand breaks. We attribute our inability to detect such unrejoined strand breaks to the relative insensitivity of the sucrose gradient procedures normally used to detect strand breaks.",Excluded
2399,"Quantitative imaging of cerebral blood flow velocity and intracellular motility using dynamic light scattering-optical coherence tomography This paper describes a novel optical method for label-free quantitative imaging of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracellular motility (IM) in the rodent cerebral cortex. This method is based on a technique that integrates dynamic light scattering (DLS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), named DLS-OCT. The technique measures both the axial and transverse velocities of CBF, whereas conventional Doppler OCT measures only the axial one. In addition, the technique produces a three-dimensional map of the diffusion coefficient quantifying nontranslational motions. In the DLS-OCT diffusion map, we observed high-diffusion spots, whose locations highly correspond to neuronal cell bodies and whose diffusion coefficient agreed with that of the motion of intracellular organelles reported in vitro in the literature. Therefore, the present method has enabled, for the first time to our knowledge, label-free imaging of the diffusion-like motion of intracellular organelles in vivo. As an example application, we used the method to monitor CBF and IM during a brief ischemic stroke, where we observed an induced persistent reduction in IM despite the recovery of CBF after stroke. This result supports that the IM measured in this study represent the cellular energy metabolism-related active motion of intracellular organelles rather than free diffusion of intracellular macromolecules.",Excluded
3013,"STAT RAD: Prospective Dose Escalation Clinical Trial of Single Fraction Scan-Plan-QA-Treat Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Painful Osseous Metastases PURPOSE: Radiation therapy is a well-established treatment for symptomatic bone metastases. Despite continued advances in both planning techniques and treatment delivery, the standard workflow has remained relatively unchanged, often requiring 1 to 3 weeks and resulting in patient inconvenience and delayed palliation. We developed an expedited method wherein computed tomography simulation, treatment planning, quality assurance, and treatment delivery are performed in 1 day. This prospective pilot clinical trial evaluates the safety, efficacy, and patient satisfaction of this rapid workflow.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with 1 to 3 painful bone metastases were prospectively enrolled and treated with 1 fraction of stereotactic body radiation therapy, using a same-day Scan-Plan-QA-Treat workflow, termed STAT RAD, in a phase 1/2 dose escalation trial from 8 Gy to 15 Gy per fraction. Bone pain, opioid use, patient satisfaction, performance status, and quality of life were evaluated before and at 1, 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks after treatment. Outcomes and treatment-related toxicity were analyzed.RESULTS: A total of 49 patients were enrolled, and 46 patients with 60 bone metastases were treated per the protocol. Partial or greater pain response occurred in 50% of patients at 1 week, 75% of patients at 8 weeks, 68.7% of patients at 6 months, and 33.3% of patients at 12 months. There were 2 grade-3 toxicities, including 1 spinal fracture associated with disease progression and hyperbilirubinemia. Reirradiation was required in 16.7% of treated lesions at a median time to retreatment of 4.9 months. Most patient responses (78.6%) indicated that patients would choose this workflow again.CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that treating bone metastases with palliative stereotactic body radiation therapy via a single-fraction, patient-centric workflow is feasible and safe with doses up to 15 Gy. However, pain response decreased at 12 months and was associated with a 16.7% retreatment rate, which suggests that further dose escalation is warranted.",Excluded

2916,"Hyperthermia improves Cetuximab accumulation in pancreatic cancer mouse model Objective: Histopathological characteristics of pancreatic carcinoma are the presence of abundant stroma that prevent mAb diffusion and consequently hampers mAb from direct attacking cancer cells. With a strong conviction that additional tool that improve mAb penetration and diffusion in dense fibroblastic solid cancer should indispensable for better therapeutic effect, we focused and employed the simple but strongest modalities, heat. Heat might increase tumor blood flow and tumor vessel permeability, leading enhanced accumulation of anticancer mAb. In this study, we aimed the increased accumulation of mAb in mouse pancreatic subcutaneous models and also boosted antitumor effects by applying moderate heat. Method(s): Heat generation was completed by hot bathtub method for subcutaneous tumor in nude mice leg. Three human pancreatic cell of different stromal amount were employed (abundant: Capan-1, moderate: BxPC-3, and scant: MIAPaCa-2). At the timing of each tumors growth up to 70mm<sup>3</sup>, Cetuximab (1 mg/kg) was systematically administrated via caudal vein, subsequently applying heat to tumors for 30 min at three different temperatures of 25degreeC (control temperature), 37degreeC (intraabdominal organs), or 41degreeC (hyperthermia) (n = 5 each). The amount of accumulated Cetuximab were quantified by the fluorescent intensity of Alexa 488 against anti-human IgG at 24 hr, followed by figuring up the intensity of one cancer cell by dividing the total intensity value by the number of a cancer cell nuclei stained with DAPI. Enhanced antitumor effects, among irradiating various heat doses, were evaluated by the tumor volume over time. Result(s): In Capan-1, the fluorescent intensity per a cancer cell at 25degreeC, 37degreeC, 41degreeC were 675, 1130, 2332 respectively. Similarly, those in BxPC-3 were 673, 1347, 1573, and in MIAPaCa-2 were 1632, 1921, 1949, respectively. In Capan-1 and BxPC-3, the mean tumor growth on day 40 were significantly inhibited at 37degreeC group (934, 189 mm<sup>3</sup>), and 41degreeC group (491, 121 mm<sup>3</sup>) in compared with 25degreeC group (1385, 470 mm<sup>3</sup>) respectively.

With a minimum follow up for 12 months, 42% of the control group had evidence of cerebral secondaries, as opposed to none in the irradiated group with no neurological signs whatsoever. The indisputable efficacy of adjuvant cerebral irradiation contrasts with the absence of any significant improvement in survival time: 2 patients are alive and in complete remission, 1 in each group, while the mean survival was 12.3 and 11.7 months respectively. This is explained by the continued occurrence of extra-cerebral metastatic deposits such as in the liver or mediastinum where the efficacy of systemic therapy remains uncertain. The therapeutic approach is currently orientated in 2 directions: to raise to dose delivered to the mediastinum even if it appears radiologically normal, and to continue research into new chemo-therapeutic combinations more specifically active at the hepatic level.",Excluded

We analyzed 135 patients with BM of NSCLC who were administered Cyberknife radiosurgery (CKRS) as either initial or salvage therapy. We evaluated local failure (LF), intracranial failure (IF), and neurological death (ND) due to BM. Primary outcome was neurological death-free survival (NDFS). Median follow-up was 16.2 months. Median CKRS dose of 22 Gy was administered to median 2 targets per patient. Among 99 deaths, 14 (14%) were ND. Upfront treatment for BM included CKRS alone in 85 patients (63%), CKRS + TA in 26 patients (19%), and WBRT in 24 patients (18%). No patients or tumor related factors were associated with ND. However, the type of upfront treatment for BM was significantly associated with ND [HR 0.07 (95% CI 0.01-0.57) for CKRS + TA, HR 0.56 (95% CI 0.19-1.68) for CKRS alone] compared with the WBRT group (P = 0.01).

Induction of Egr-1 in the pars tuberalis began ~11h after dawn. This response was followed ~6h later by dramatic induction in the tuberal hypothalamus, including in the ependymal cells lining the third ventricle. At approximately the same time, Egr-1 was induced in dopaminergic and vasoactive intestinal peptide neurons in the tuberal hypothalamus and in dopaminergic neurons of the premammillary nucleus. We noted no induction in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons until 2h after dawn the following morning.

Copper octabromotetracarboranylphenylporphyrin (CuTCPBr), synthesized by bromination of CuTCPH, is one of several new minimally toxic analogues of CuTCPH being studied in our laboratory, which could possess comparable or better tumour-targeting properties with enhanced tumour cytotoxicity. Its biodistribution, biokinetics and toxicity in mice with subcutaneous EMT-6 (mammary) or SCCVII (squamous cell) carcinomas were compared with those of CuTCPH. The administration of approximately 200 mg kg(-1) of either porphyrin in six intraperitoneal injections over 2 days had no apparent effect, but administration of approximately 400 mg kg(-1) slightly lowered body weights, elevated alanine and aspartate transaminase activities in blood plasma, and depressed blood platelet counts for several days. Enzymes and platelets returned to normal within 5 days after those injections and body weights returned to normal within 2 weeks. High average concentrations of boron from either porphyrin were achieved in the two tumour models from a total dose of approximately 200 mg kg(-1). The high tumour boron concentration decreased slowly while concentrations in blood decreased rapidly. Boron concentrations in brain and skin were consistently lower than in tumour by a factor of 10 or more. Although either CuTCPH or CuTCPBr can be labelled with (64)Cu for imaging by positron emission tomography (PET), CuTCPBr can also be labelled by (76)Br, another PET-imageable nuclide.",Excluded
2563,"Asynchronous inputs and NMDA conductances predict excitatory responses in the cortical-cA1 pathway of the hippocampus In the hippocampus, CA1 place cells are driven by a substantial input from CA3. There is a second pathway to CA1 from the entorhinal cortex. The mode of action of cortex on CA1 through this pathway is not known. The pathway supports CA1 place field activity after CA3 has been lesioned, yet stimulation of the pathway in rat slices results in strong feedforward inhibition that prevents pyramidal cell action potentials. We use a detailed conductance-based model of this pathway to simulate the response to cortical stimulation in slice experiments and in vivo spatial exploration. We find that the presence of NMDA conductances enable CA1 pyramidal cells to integrate cortical inputs over a time scale longer than that which is effective in recruiting the inhibitory response that can suppress action potentials. We then show that this asynchronous response mode supports place field formation in response to experimentally constrained spatially modulated cortical activity. Within this model, the inclusion of GABAB conductances and the hyperpolarisation activated current I(h) reduces the strength of the GABAA inputs required to balance the excitatory inputs, and this facilitates place field formation by reducing variability in the inhibitory inputs.",Excluded
3555,"Color coded maps of white matter tracts: No need for tractography BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: White matter tracts can be observed using tractograms generated from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, the dependence of these tract images on subjective variables, including how seed points are placed and the preferred level of fractional anisotropy, introduces interobserver inconsistency and potential lack of reliability. We propose that color coded maps (CCM) generated from DTI can be a preferred method for the visualization of important white matter tracts. METHOD(S): DTI was acquired in 25 patients with brain tumors. Lesions included 15 tumors of glial origin, 9 metastatic tumors, two meningiomas, and one cavernous angioma. Tractograms of the pyramidal and/or optic radiations, based on tumor location, were created by marking seed regions of interest using known anatomical locations. We compared the degree of tract involvement and white matter alteration between CCMs and tractograms. Neurological outcomes were obtained from chart reviews. RESULT(S): The pyramidal tract was evaluated in 20/25 patients, the visual tracts were evaluated in 10/25, and both tracts were evaluated in 5/25. In 19/25 studies, the same patterns of white matter alternations were found between the CCM and tractograms. In the 6 patients where patterns differed, 2 tractograms were not useful in determining pattern alteration; in the remaining 4/6, no practical difference was seen in comparing the studies. Two patients were lost to follow up. Thirteen patients were neurologically improved or remained intact after intervention. In these, 10 of the 13 patients showed displaced white matter tracts on CCM. Twelve patients had no improvement of their preoperative deficit. In 9 of these 12 patients, CCM showed white matter disruption. CONCLUSION(S): CCMs provide a convenient, practical, and objective method of visualizing white matter tracts, obviating the need for potentially subjective and time-consuming tractography. CCMs are at least as reliable as tractograms in predicting neurological outcomes after neurosurgical intervention.",Excluded
3110,"Cholinergic modulation of visuospatial responding in central thalamus Central thalamus has extensive connections with basal ganglia and frontal cortex that are thought to play a critical role in sensory-guided goal-directed behavior. Central thalamic activity is influenced by cholinergic projections from mesopontine nuclei. To elucidate this function we trained rats to respond to lights in a reaction time (RT) task and compared effects of muscarinic (2.4, 7.3, 22 nmol scopolamine) and nicotinic (5.4, 16, 49, 98 nmol mecamylamine) antagonists with the GABA(A) agonist muscimol (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 nmol) in central thalamus. We compared this with subcutaneous (systemic) effects of mecamylamine (3.2, 9.7, 29 micromol/kg) and scopolamine (0.03, 0.09, 0.26 micromol/kg). Subcutaneous scopolamine increased omissions (failure to respond within a 3-s response window) at the highest dose tested. Subcutaneous mecamylamine increased omissions at the highest dose tested while impairing RT and per cent correct at lower doses. Intrathalamic injections of muscimol and mecamylamine decreased per cent correct at doses that did not affect omissions or RT. Intrathalamic scopolamine increased omissions and RT at doses that had little effect on per cent correct. Anatomical controls indicated that the effects of mecamylamine were localized in central thalamus and those of scopolamine were not. Drug effects did not interact with attention-demanding manipulations of stimulus duration, proximity of stimulus and response locations, or stimulus array size. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that central thalamus mediates decisional processes linking sensory stimuli with actions, downstream from systems that detect sensory signals. They also provide evidence that this function is specifically influenced by nicotinic cholinergic receptors.",Excluded
3118,"DASL-HiCaP: Darolutamide augments standard therapy for localized very high-risk cancer of the prostate (ANZUP1801)-A randomized phase III doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial of adding darolutamide to androgen deprivation therapy and definitive or salvage radiation Background: Radiation therapy (RT), plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue (LHRHA), is standard of care for men with very high-risk localized prostate cancer (PC), or with very high- risk features and persistent PSA after radical prostatectomy (RP). Despite this, incurable distant metastases develop within 5 years in 15% of men with very high-risk features. Darolutamide is a structurally distinct oral androgen receptor antagonist with low blood-brain-barrier penetration, a demonstrated favorable safety profile and low potential for drug-drug interactions. Our aim is to determine the efficacy of adding darolutamide to ADT and RT in the setting of either primary definitive therapy, or adjuvant therapy for very high-risk PC. Method(s): This study is a randomized (1:1) phase III placebo-controlled, double-blind trial for men planned for RT who have very high-risk localized PC; or very high-risk features with PSA persistence or rise within one year following RP. The trial will be stratified by: RP; use of adjuvant docetaxel; pelvic nodal involvement. 1100 participants will be randomized to darolutamide 600 mg or placebo twice daily for 96 weeks. Participants will receive LHRHA for 96 weeks, plus RT starting week 8-24 from randomisation. Participants are allowed nonsteroidal antiandrogen (up to 90 days) in addition to LHRHA up until randomisation. Early treatment with up to 6 cycles of docetaxel completed at least 4 weeks prior to RT is permitted. The primary endpoint is metastasis-free survival (ICECaP-validated), with secondary endpoints overall survival, PC-specific survival, PSA-progression free survival, time to subsequent hormonal therapy, time to castrationresistance, frequency and severity of adverse events, health related quality of life, fear of recurrence. Tertiary endpoints include incremental cost-effectiveness, and identification of prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers of treatment response, safety and resistance to study treatment.",Excluded

3224,"Ultrasound assessment of atheromatous changes in the vertebral and common carotid artery in patients after radiation due to breast cancer Introduction. Early diagnosis and modern radiotherapy have helped to significantly improve the prognosis in breast cancer, decrease mortality and increase the frequency of vascular complications connected with the treatment. The increase in the risk of vascular complications may be caused by inflammatory and atheromatous changes in the coronary and carotid arteries provoked by ionizing radiation. It has been proved that the risk of stroke in a long-term observation of patients who have completed the treatment (average observation time 4.5 years) is significantly higher than in non-treated patients. On the basis of the above information, one can suppose that the factor responsible for acute brain incident, such as stroke, in patients after radiotherapy due to breast cancer, as in patients irradiated because of head and neck cancers, is hemodynamically significant radiation-induced narrowing of the vessels. Objectives. Ultrasound assessment of vessel walls and Doppler measurement of blood flow parameters in the radiated arteries in the supraclavicular area (the first part of the common carotid artery, vertebral artery) as well as determination of a difference in the assessed parameters of the wall morphology and blood flow waveform between the side treated with radiotherapy and the non-treated side. The third aim was the assessment of the dynamics of atheromatous changes over time after finishing radiotherapy. Material and method. A group of 41 patients treated at the Institute of Oncology in Gliwice, Poland were observed from the year 2003 to 2014. The average age of the patients was 60. The dose in the supraclavicular area was identical for all patients and amounted to 50.0 Gy. The average time after the treatment ended was 54 months. The assessment of vessels concerned both common carotid arteries (CCA), the division of the common carotid arteries, the initial internal carotid arteries (ICA) including the measurement of the internal and medial membrane (Intima-Media Thickness - IMT) in the proximal segment of the CCA and the vertebral arteries with particular regard to their proximal segment. Results. The average IMT on the radiated side was 0.68 +/- 0.11 mm, and on the opposite side - 0.62 +/- 0.09 mm. On the basis of the statistical analysis of the differences between average IMT on the radiated side (IMT-RT) and IMT of the non-radiated side (IMT NRT), it has been confirmed that it is statistically significant (p = (0,044) for the assumed relevance level of p = 0.05. When analyzing the change of IMT over the time that passed from the conclusion of treatment, it was found that it had no important influence on the increase in the internal membrane thickness. In the second stage of the research, it was attempted to assess the proximal segment of the vertebral artery and indirectly the subclavian artery using B-duplex ultrasonography. The results show that narrowing is more common on the radiated side. In one case, narrowing of the vertebral artery and its thickening throughout all the observed segment from V0 to V2 were observed, which suggests inflammatory lesions caused by radiation in all three arterial walls. Conclusions. Radiotherapy of patients with breast cancer involving the supraclavicular arteries causes an increase in internal membrane thickness in the common carotid arteries. Radiation of this area increases the frequency of vertebral artery narrowing in the proximal segment. Copyright © ONKOLOGIA I RADIOTERAPIA 2015.",Excluded
3014,"Pre-and post-bevacizumab glioblastoma histopathology, biomarkers and imaging: An autopsy study Anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab is frequently used to treat recurrent glioblastomas (GBMs). Imaging after bevacizumab therapy to evaluate therapeutic response and/or progression is complicated by biologic alterations that may preclude detection of viable tumor by routine MRI methods. Preliminary data using an innovative and advanced diffusionweighted imaging technique developed at UC San Diego, restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), suggest that RSI provides a more robust marker of tumor cellularity relative to standard diffusion-weighted imaging. Previously published studies by others have demonstrated that bevacizumab- treated GBMs have altered imaging findings and relapse as tumors with a conspicuous perivascular invasive phenotype. This phenotype is also replicated by murine models of anti-angiogenic therapy. A biomarker study of four cases of paired pretreatment GBMs and post-bevacizumab autopsy brain tissue that was matched to RSI tumor zones was performed to better characterize the invasive tumor phenotype in response to bevacizumab. Patients were 56-66 years (mean: 61) at the time of diagnosis. Survival time from diagnosis to death ranged from 9 to 24 months (mean: 16). All patients received standard radiation and temozolamide, followed by bevacizumab. Histology of pre-treatment tumors was variable without a conspicuous perivascular invasive phenotype. RSI on post-bevacizumab therapy showed areas of high signal intensity consistent with tumor progression. Similar areas sampled at the time of autopsy revealed a conspicuous perivascular tumor phenotype. Intense PTEN immunoreactivity in tumor microvasculature was present in all pre-treatment tissues, but was absent after treatment. Both EGFR (internal domain) and pMAPK were unchanged by treatment. EGFRvIII immunoreactivity was more variable between pre- and posttreatment specimens. Overall, RSI could detect tumors after bevacizumab therapy characterized by conspicuous zones of perivascular tumor cells with alterations in biomarkers.",Excluded
2590,"Role of the Toll Like receptor (TLR) radical cycle in chronic inflammation: possible treatments targeting the TLR4 pathway Activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complex, a receptor of the innate immune system, may underpin the pathophysiology of many human diseases, including asthma, cardiovascular disorder, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune disorders, neuroinflammatory disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, clinical depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, alcohol abuse, and toluene inhalation. TLRs are pattern recognition receptors that recognize damage-associated molecular patterns and pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria. Here we focus on the environmental factors, which are known to trigger TLR4, e.g., ozone, atmosphere particulate matter, long-lived reactive oxygen intermediate, pentachlorophenol, ionizing radiation, and toluene. Activation of the TLR4 pathways may cause chronic inflammation and increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and oxidative and nitrosative stress and therefore TLR-related diseases. This implies that drugs or substances that modify these pathways may prevent or improve the abovementioned diseases. Here we review some of the most promising drugs and agents that have the potential to attenuate TLR-mediated inflammation, e.g., anti-LPS strategies that aim to neutralize LPS (synthetic anti-LPS peptides and recombinant factor C) and TLR4/MyD88 antagonists, including eritoran, CyP, EM-163, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, 6-shogaol, cinnamon extract, N-acetylcysteine, melatonin, and molecular hydrogen.

Two subjects were making their first spaceflight. In parabolic flight, their time constants shortened to an average of 60% of 1 G values, presumably because unfamiliar otolith cues reduced VS. However, after 4-10 days in orbit, their time constants were similar or greater than those preflight, indicating VS recovery. The other two subjects had previously flown in space.

A 59-year old man was referred for intermittent, neuralgic pain localized to the right gluteal region and leg. He also developed slight neurologic symptoms such as numbness, paraesthesias and a slight weakness of the right leg. The symptoms had begun 6 months after radiation therapy after prostatectomy for prostate carcinoma. There were no antecendent back or hip injuries. There was a right Lasegue sign. On the visual analog scale pain ranks between 0 (rest) and 8-10 (attack) were recorded. Needle electromyography showed denervation in gluteus medius and maximus, biceps femoris, quadriceps femoris, tibialis ant and peroneus longus. Normal laboratory studies included urin analysis, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimention rate, serumglucose, electrolytes, rheumatoid factor, and protein electrophoresis. Pelvic computed tomography (CT) was normal. Lumbosacral MRI was not performed. Liver- and renal enzymes were elevated. On admission the patient was treated with diclofenac (2 x 50 mg/d) and carbarnazepine (3 x 200 mg). Gabapentin was chosen because it is well tolerated and it appears to have a favorable efficacy-to-toxicity ratio.

2449,"Accelerated recovery of consciousness after general anesthesia is associated with increased functional brain connectivity in the high-gamma bandwidth Recent data from our laboratory demonstrate that high-frequency gamma connectivity across the cortex is present during consciousness and depressed during unconsciousness. However, these data were derived fromstatic and well-defined states of arousal rather than during transitions that would suggest functional relevance. We also recently found that subanesthetic ketamine administered during isoflurane anesthesia accelerates recovery upon discontinuation of the primary anesthetic and increases gamma power during emergence. In the current study we re-analyzed electroencephalogram (EEG) data to test the hypothesis that functional cortical connectivity between anterior and posterior cortical regions would be increased during accelerated recovery induced by ketamine when compared to saline-treated controls. Rodents were instrumented with intracranial EEG electrodes and general anesthesia was induced with isoflurane anesthesia. After 37.5 min of continuous isoflurane anesthesia, a subanesthetic dose of ketamine (25 mg/kg intraperitoneal) was administered, with evidence of a 44% reduction in emergence time. In this study, we analyzed gamma and theta coherence (measure of undirected functional connectivity) and normalized symbolic transfer entropy (measure of directed functional connectivity) between frontal and parietal cortices during various levels of consciousness, with a focus on emergence from isoflurane anesthesia. During accelerated emergence in the ketamine-treated group, there was increased frontal-parietal coherence {p = 0.005, 0.05-0.23 [95% confidence interval (CI)]} and normalized symbolic transfer entropy [frontal to parietal: p < 0.001, 0.010-0.026 (95% CI); parietal to frontal: p < 0.001, 0.009-0.025 (95% CI)] in high-frequency gamma bandwidth as compared with the saline-treated group.

3114,"Investigation of PKC isoform-specific translocation and targeting of the current of the late afterhyperpolarizing potential of myenteric AH neurons AH neurons in the enteric nervous system play an essential role in initiating intestinal reflexes and factors that control AH neuron excitability therefore influence the state of the digestive system. Prominent afterhyperpolarizations that follow action potentials in these neurons strongly affect their excitability. In the present work, we have investigated the regulation of the afterhyperpolarizing current (I(AHP)) by protein kinase C (PKC). Electrophysiological responses and protein translocation were investigated in AH neurons of freshly dissected preparations of myenteric ganglia from the guinea-pig ileum. The activator of conventional and novel PKCs, phorbol dibutyrate, but not the activator of novel PKCs, ingenol, blocked the I(AHP). Phorbol dibutyrate had no effect on the hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) or on the A current (I(A)). Stimulation of synaptic inputs to the neurons also reduced the I(AHP), and had no effect on I(h) or I(A). Phorbol dibutyrate also reduced a background outward current that was present after the I(AHP) current had been blocked by clotrimazole. Both phorbol dibutyrate and ingenol caused translocation of the novel PKC, PKCepsilon, in these neurons. Only phorbol dibutyrate caused translocation of PKCgamma, a conventional PKC. The studies thus indicate that the activation of PKC by phorbol esters and by nerve stimulation affects AH neurons in a similar way, and that PKC activation targets both the I(AHP) and another background K(+) current. The I(AHP) is targeted by a conventional PKC, suggested to be PKCgamma, as this is the only conventional PKC that is prominent in AH neurons.",Excluded
3313,"A review of the necessary planning target volume margins for patients receiving radiation to the brain, with the current immobilization devices in use at the hopital regional de sudbury regional hospital regional cancer program The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the current margins of the planning target volumes in brain patients being treated at the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program. The gross tumour volume (GTV) is defined in the International Commission for Radiation Units & Measurements (ICRU) report 83 (2010) as the gross demonstrable extent and location of the tumour. The clinical target volume (CTV) is defined as the volume of a tissue that contains the GTV and any microscopic tumour spread. The planning target volume (PTV) is defined by the ICRU 83 report (2010) as the margin accounting for both the internal and external uncertainties. With the use of image-guided radiation therapy such as cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), imaging and positioning has become much more accurate. A CBCT uses a 3D reconstructed volume of the patient's current position before treatment to verify and correct the setup. This is done by comparing it to the planning patient position as seen with the planning CT image and making any adjustments while the patient is on the bed (Pouliot, Bani-Hashemi, Chen, Svatos, Ghelmansarai, Mitschke, 2005). Daily imaging before treatment has allowed for positioning of the patient accurately to match the image taken for planning purposes. This allows the patient to be set up within millimetres of the position they were in for planning. Currently at the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program, daily imaging for patients receiving radiation to the brain is not standard practice, however, some patients are imaged daily by request from the physician. By using the shift data from patients who have received daily imaging, the setup uncertainty for every fraction can be determined and used to determine an appropriate PTV margin for the majority of patients, who are not imaged daily. If the PTV can be reduced for brain patients being treated, less of the normal brain tissue would be irradiated and could have the potential to reduce acute and late neurotoxicity of treatment (McDonald et al., 2011). A retrospective review of patients who have previously received radiation to the brain with daily CBCT imaging will be done to examine the shifts done before treatment to match the CBCT to the planning CT image. The patient population will include patients who received brain radiation and a daily CBCT before treatment since July 2010. The images taken daily before treatment will be retrospectively studied using the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program's electronic charting system (Mosaic).

The shift data describes the measurements by which the patient was shifted after daily imaging to match the original planning image.

2487,"Microglial trogocytosis and the complement system regulate axonal pruning in vivo Partial phagocytosis-called trogocytosis-of axons by microglia has been documented in ex vivo preparations but has not been directly observed in vivo. The mechanisms that modulate microglial trogocytosis of axons and its function in neural circuit development remain poorly understood. Here, we directly observe axon trogocytosis by microglia in vivo in the developing Xenopus laevis retinotectal circuit. We show that microglia regulate pruning of retinal ganglion cell axons and are important for proper behavioral response to dark and bright looming stimuli. Using bioinformatics, we identify amphibian regulator of complement activation 3, a homolog of human CD46, as a neuronally expressed synapse-associated complement inhibitory molecule that inhibits trogocytosis and axonal pruning. Using a membrane-bound complement C3 fusion protein, we demonstrate that enhancing complement activity enhances axonal pruning. Our results support the model that microglia remodel axons via trogocytosis and that neurons can control this process through expression of complement inhibitory proteins.

3505,"Effects of Proton and Combined Proton and (56)Fe Radiation on the Hippocampus The space radiation environment contains protons and (56)Fe, which could pose a significant hazard to space flight crews during and after missions. The space environment involves complex radiation exposures, thus, the effects of a dose of protons might be modulated by a dose of heavy-ion radiation. The brain, and particularly the hippocampus, may be susceptible to space radiation-induced changes. In this study, we first determined the dose-response effect of proton radiation (150 MeV) on hippocampus-dependent cognition 1 and 3 months after exposure. Based on those results, we subsequently exposed mice to protons alone (150 MeV, 0.1 Gy), (56)Fe alone (600 MeV/n, 0.5 Gy) or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations (protons first) with the two exposures separated by 24 h. At one month postirradiation, all animal groups showed novel object recognition. However, at three months postirradiation, mice exposed to either protons or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations showed impaired novel object recognition, which was not observed in mice irradiated with (56)Fe alone. The mechanisms in these impairments might involve inflammation. In mice irradiated with protons alone or (56)Fe alone three months earlier, there was a negative correlation between a measure of novel object recognition and the number of newly born activated microglia in the dentate gyrus. Next, cytokine and chemokine levels were assessed in the hippocampus. At one month after exposure the levels of IL-12 were higher in mice exposed to combined radiations compared with sham-irradiated mice, while the levels of IFN-gamma were lower in mice exposed to (56)Fe radiation alone or combined radiations. In addition, IL-4 levels were lower in (56)Fe-irradiated mice compared with proton-irradiated mice and TNF-alpha levels were lower in proton-irradiated mice than in mice receiving combined radiations. At three months after exposure, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) and eotaxin levels were lower in mice receiving combined radiations. The levels of MDC and eotaxin correlated and the levels of MDC, but not eotaxin, correlated with the percentage of newly born activated microglia in the blades of the dentate gyrus. Finally, hippocampal IL-6 levels were higher in mice receiving combined radiations compared with mice receiving (56)Fe radiation alone. These data demonstrate the sensitivity of novel object recognition for detecting cognitive injury three months after exposure to proton radiation alone, and combined exposure to proton and (56)Fe radiations, and that newly-born activated microglia and inflammation might be involved in this injury.",Included
2942,"The impact of multimodality therapy of distal esophageal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas on treatment-related toxicity and complications The benefit of multimodality therapy is clearly established for adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction, but its impact on toxicity is not well defined. We reviewed data from prospective randomized trials to better define the risks of multimodality therapy. The rates of surgical mortality and complications range from 0% to 10% and 23% to 49%, respectively. Multimodality therapy increases acute toxicity. The rate of severe acute hematologic toxicity varies considerably between trials (3%-78%) and appears to be primarily attributable to chemotherapy. Common severe acute nonhematologic toxicities include esophagitis (16%-63%), infection (2%-30%), pain (3%-24%), and gastrointestinal (6%-60%) and cardiac (3%-19%) events. The individual contribution of each modality to nonhematologic toxicities is unclear, but toxicity is increased when adding radiosensitizing chemotherapy to radiotherapy. There is an acute decrease in quality of life with multimodality therapy; however, quality of life usually returns to, or exceeds, baseline by 12 months after therapy. Late toxicities are less well defined, but commonly include esophageal, pulmonary, and cardiac toxicities.",Excluded

This U.S. National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) analysis was performed to improve the evidence guiding decision-making regarding postoperative therapy for early stage LCNEC. Method(s): Overall survival of patients with pathologic T1-2aN0 LCNEC who underwent resection in the NCDB from 2003 to 2015 was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis. Patients who died within 30 days of surgery were excluded. These prospective data were acquired by certified tumor registrars, and include over 80% of cancer diagnoses annually in the U.S. Result(s): Of the 5,177 patients who met study criteria, adjuvant therapy was given to 31% of patients (n=1585): 20% received chemotherapy (n=1039), 8% chemoradiation (n=400), and 3% radiation (n=146). In stage IA LCNEC, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved survival when compared to no adjuvant therapy in unadjusted analysis (five-year survival 55% vs. 53%; p=0.03) but not after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.02). Of note, adjuvant chemoradiation (HR 1.66; 95% CI 1.11 to 2.48) and adjuvant radiation (HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.25) were associated with worse survival when compared to no adjuvant therapy.

2701,"Long-term results of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation in limited small cell lung cancer Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a chemoresponsive tumor but overall survival remains poor even in limited disease (LD). With the aim of eradicating chemoresistant tumor cells and reducing toxicity, we investigated in this phase II trial the feasibility and outcome of a sequential approach of induction chemotherapy (CT) followed, in responding patients with LD-SCLC, by intensified platinum-based CT and concurrent thoracic irradiation (TI). Material(s) and Method(s): We treated 55 consecutive LD-SCLC patients with three 21-day cycles of cyclophosphamide, epiadriamycin and vincristine (CEV) as induction CT. In 44 (80%) patients there was an objective response and they received treatment intensification consisting of TI and concomitant CT with carboplatin and etoposide plus recombinant granulocite colony stimulating factor. Twenty-five (57%) patients were submitted to twice-daily thoracic irradiation (TDTI; 1.5 Gy per fraction, to a total dose of 45 Gy) and 19 (43%) to once-daily thoracic irradiation (ODTI; 2 Gy per fraction, to a total dose of 50 Gy). Result(s): Median follow up was 75 months (range, 42-102). Of 44 patients submitted to intensification with TI plus CT, 32 (73%) had a complete and 12 (27%) a partial response. Median overall survival of all 55 patients was 17 months with actuarial survival probabilities of 2 and 5 years, 32 and 25%, respectively. Analysis of patient sub-groups showed a 5-month median survival in non-responders, 19 in TDTI and 17 in ODTI patients, respectively. Two and 5 year survival probabilities were 0% in non-responders, 40 and 35% in TDTI and 39 and 21% in ODTI patients, respectively. At present, 13 of 44 responders are still alive, of which nine (20%) have been progression-free from 45 to 93 months (median 60). Treatment failure was registered in 31 (70%) of 44 patients who received both induction and intensification treatment. One-half of patients had intrathoracic recurrence, eight of which only local and the remaining seven local and distant. Fourteen (32%) patients had brain metastases. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 24 (55%) patients with no differences between treatment groups. Grade 3 esophagitis was registered in four (9%) patients: in 3/25 (12%) and 1/19 (5%) of those who received TDTI and ODTI, respectively (P=not significant). Acute radiation pneumonitis occurred in three (12%) patients submitted to TDTI. No clinically debilitating pulmonary fibrosis, permanent esophageal stricture or toxic death was observed. Conclusion(s): In LD-SCLC patients late concurrent CT plus TI is feasible and effective. Our long-term results are similar to the best reported in the literature. Despite the high incidence of complete response obtained, however, one-half of the patients had intrathoracic relapse and one-third brain metastases. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Morphologically, nuclear and cytoplasmic swelling, vacuolation of cytoplasm, and giant cell formation occurred in a dose dependent manner after 24 hours from irradiation. Decreased staining intensity for F VIII RAg was observed in morphologically affected cells. The capacity to synthesize PGI2 was significantly enhanced at 24 hours, but less significant at 72 hours after irradiation.

The results of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for the treatment of patients with brain metastases from gynecologic cancer (ovarian, endometrial, and uterine cervical cancers) were retrospectively analyzed to identify the efficacy and prognostic factors for local tumor control and survival. Methods The medical records were retrospectively reviewed of 70 patients with 306 tumors who underwent GKS for brain metastases from gynecologic cancer between January 1995 and December 2013 in our institution. Results The primary cancers were ovarian in 33 patients with 147 tumors and uterine in 37 patients with 159 tumors. Median tumor volume was 0.3 cm<sup>3</sup>. Median marginal prescription dose was 20 Gy. The local tumor control rates were 96.4% at 6 months and 89.9% at 1 year. There was no statistically significant difference between ovarian and uterine cancers. Higher prescription dose and smaller tumor volume were significantly correlated with local tumor control. Median overall survival time was 8 months. Primary ovarian cancer, controlled extracranial metastases, and solitary brain metastasis were significantly correlated with satisfactory overall survival. Median activities of daily living (ADL) preservation survival time was 8 months. Primary ovarian cancer, controlled extracranial metastases, and higher Karnofsky Performance Status score were significantly correlated with better ADL preservation. Conclusions GKS is effective for control of tumor progression in patients with brain metastases from gynecologic cancer, and may provide neurologic benefits and preservation of the quality of life.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of CTLA-4 inhibitors in the treatment of metastatic melanoma with limited brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Between January 2008 and June 2011, 58 patients with limited brain metastases from melanoma were treated with SRS with a median dose of 20 Gy delivered to the 50% isodose line (range, 15-20 Gy). In 25 patients, ipilimumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 3 mg/kg over 90 min every 3 weeks for a median of four doses (range, 1-8). Local control (LC), freedom from new brain metastases, and overall survival (OS) were assessed from the date of the SRS procedure. The median LC, freedom from new brain metastases, and OS for the entire group were 8.7, 4.3, and 5.9 months, respectively. The cause of death was CNS progression in all but eight patients. Six-month LC, freedom from new brain metastases, and OS were 65, 35, and 56%, respectively, for those who received ipilimumab and 63, 47, and 46% for those who did not (P=NS).

3591,"Octopamine modulates photoreceptor function in the Limulus lateral eye Activity at night in efferent nerve fibers from a central circadian clock produces changes in photoreceptor function in the lateral compound eye of Limulus: the response to light is increased; membrane potential fluctuations (bumps) occurring in the dark are suppressed; and the duration of bumps occurring both in the dark and under dim illumination is increased (Barlow et al., 1977; Kaplan & Barlow, 1980; Barlow, 1983; Barlow et al., 1985). Efferent nerve terminals release octopamine when activated (Battelle et al., 1982; Battelle & Evans, 1984, 1986); exogenous octopamine in vitro produces some of the changes resulting from efferent nerve activity in vivo (Kass et al., 1988). We report here that the increase in both on-transient and steady-state response to light induced by octopamine in the lateral eye in vitro are concentration dependent with threshold at or below 100 nM, saturation at or above 100 microM, and half-maximal increase in the range 1-10 microM. Octopamine also reduces bump activity in the dark in a concentration-dependent way. Unlike the increase in light response, the dependence of this effect on octopamine concentration is extremely variable from specimen to specimen. The effects of exogenous octopamine on light response and bump activity can sometimes be reversed by removing octopamine from the medium bathing the in vitro preparation. Octopamine also increases bump duration, apparently in a concentration-dependent manner. We have not succeeded in reversing this increase in bump duration. The concentration dependence of changes in photoreceptor response described here agrees qualitatively with the dependence of cAMP levels on octopamine in Limulus photoreceptors (Kaupp et al., 1982), lending further support to the idea that cAMP acts as a second messenger in the circadian control of photoreceptor function. Our results also suggest that the changes induced in the transient and steady-state response to light by both efferent nerve activity and exogenous octopamine have a common origin, which may differ from that responsible for the modulation of bump activity.",Excluded

Method(s): The data of 46 patients treated with WBI + RS were matched 1:1 to 46 patients treated with NR + WBI + B with respect to age, gender, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), tumor type, extracerebral metastases, and interval from first diagnosis of cancer to treatment of the metastasis, RPA class, and GPA score. Both groups were compared for local control of the treated metastasis, intracerebral control, and survival. Result(s): The 1-year local control rates were 85% after WBI + RS and 78% after NR + WBI + B (p = 0.35). The 1-year intracerebral control rates were 74% and 68% (p = 0.33), respectively. The 1-year survival rates were 64% and 58% (p = 0.70), respectively. A multivariate analysis was not performed for local and intracerebral control, because no factor achieved significance on univariate analyses for these endpoints. Improved survival was associated with KPS > 70 (p = 0.032), absence of extracerebral metastases (p = 0.003), RPA-class 1 (p = 0.014), and GPA score of 3.0-4.0 (p = 0.010).

We have extended these observations to cultured cortical neurons and studied the effect of EGb 761 on neuronal survival (evaluated as MTT reduction), the presence of condensed nuclei (monitored as Hoechst staining), the time-course of caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation (measured by cleavage of specific fluorescent substrates) and superoxide anion production (evaluated by hydroethidine staining) after the exposure to staurosporine. Results show that 200 mug/ml of EGb 761 increased cell survival and reduced the number of condensed nuclei after the exposure to 200 nM staurosporine. Vitamin E and the spin trapper alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) also significantly increased cell survival. In contrast, the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors ZVAD and ZBIOT showed no protection. Similarly, selective inhibitors of caspase-1 (YVAD-CHO), caspase-2 (VDVAD-CHO), caspase-3 (DEVD-CHO) and caspase-8 (IETD-CHO) did not protect against cell damage induced by staurosporine. The protective effect of EGb 761 was not enhanced when coincubated with vitamin E or DEVD-CHO. Caspase-3 activity was maximally induced 5-8 h after staurosporine exposure. Both EGb 761 and vitamin E showed a tendency to decrease caspase-3 activity. In contrast, activation of caspase-1 and caspase-9 was not observed at any of the times studied after STS exposure. Exposure to staurosporine resulted in increased superoxide production that was maximal at 5 h. EGb 761 significantly inhibited superoxide production at short times after staurosporine exposure. Vitamin E and PBN also significantly reduced superoxide production. Results suggest that EGb 761 neuroprotective effect might be mediated by its well-known antioxidant activity, which might also influence caspase-3 activation. Inhibition of capase-3 induced by EGb 761 and vitamin E does not seem to contribute to their observed protective action. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Repeat studies in humans over a relatively brief period of time have not been possible because of the 110-min half-life of fluorine-18. With the synthesis of 11C-deoxyglucose it has now become possible to utilize this short-lived (20 min) tracer for the measurement of LCMRgl and to determine its variability within subjects over a 2-h period. The kinetic rate constants for 11C-deoxyglucose were determined for gray and white matter and found to be very similar to those for 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, suggesting that these two analogues of glucose have similar affinities for the facilitated transport system and are similar substrates for hexokinase in the brain. The coefficient of variation of repeated measurements of LCMRgl in a series of six normal subjects was 5.5% to 8.7% for various gray matter structures and 9.7% and 14.0% for white matter structures. The pattern of cerebral metabolic rates is relatively constant in a given individual when the conditions of the study are unchanged.

Obese and morbidly obese patients received increased contrast (NO = 180 [150-230]mL, O = 190 [160-250]mL, MO = 200 [165-225]mL, p = 0.016), dose area product (NO = 75.56 [50.61-113.69]Gycm<sup>2</sup>, O = 116.4 [76.11-157.82]Gycm<sup>2</sup>, MO = 125.62 [92.22-158.81]Gycm<sup>2</sup>, p < 0.0001), entrance air kerma (NO = 1439.42 [977.0-2075.5]mGy, O = 2111.63 [1492.0-3011.0]mGy, MO = 2376.0 [1700.0-3234.42]mGy, p < 0.0001), and peak skin dose (NO = 1439.42 [977.0-2075.5], O = 2111.63 [1492.0-3011.0], MO = 2376.0 [1700.0-3234.42], p < 0.0001). Effective radiation dose increased in obese patients (NO = 20.9 +/- 14.9mSv, O = 27.4 +/- 17.1mSv, MO = 24.1 +/- 12.6mSv, p < 0.0001 for NO vs O, p = 0.449 for NO vs MO). Conclusion(s): Percutaneous coronary intervention can be performed in obese and morbidly obese patients without elevated risk for most clinical outcomes. However, radiation increases above levels that could cause both transient and late effects. Strategies should be pursued to minimise radiation dose. Copyright © 2017",Excluded
3146,"Brachytherapy of cancer. [Japanese] Brachytherapy is one of most effective methods of radiotherapy for cancer, and therefore, low-dose-rate brachytherapy is widely used for carcinoma of the uterus and carcinoma of the tongue. Between 1974 and 1983, 76 primary thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinomas were treated with external irradiation combined with additional intracavitary radium therapy at the National Sapporo Hospital. The esophageal primary control rate was 34% and the 5-year survival rate was 24.1%. We believe that external irradiation therapy followed by additional intracavitary radium irradiation produces good results. Also, from 1982, 30 patients with small residual or unresectable tumors received interstitial irradiation using an after-loading technique and iridium-192 seeds. Eighteen of these 30 patients treated with iridium-192 were recurrent cases, and 20 had outer tubes intra-operatively inserted into the tumor following iridium-192 irradiation. Ten of these patients had brain tumor, nine had cancer of the head and neck, and each of the remaining fifteen had the following malignancies: lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, bile duct cancer, uterus cancer, skin cancer and soft tissue sarcoma. Overall 4-year survival was 17.1% in among the patients treated with Ir 192. Favorable preliminary results from these patients and those of various clinical trials on the extension of indications for brachytherapy were also reported.",Excluded
2721,"CEP-1347 (KT7515), an inhibitor of JNK activation, rescues sympathetic neurons and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells from death evoked by three distinct insults The c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling cascade appears to play a role in some cases of cell death, including neuronal apoptosis. CEP-1347 (KT7515), an indolocarbazole of the K252a family, blocks this stress signaling cascade and promotes survival. Here, we used CEP-1347 to probe whether neuronal death pathways activated by distinct insults also possess elements in common. Cultured rat sympathetic neurons and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells were induced to die by withdrawal of nerve growth factor, exposure to ultraviolet irradiation, or subjection to oxidative stress. In each case, death was prevented by 100-200 nM CEP-1347. Moreover, in each of these death paradigms, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 activity in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells was elevated by two- or threefold, and this increase was totally blocked by CEP-1347 at concentrations that promoted survival. In contrast, 200 nM CEP-1347 did not block death due to serum withdrawal from undifferentiated PC12 cells or to activation of Fas in Jurkat T cell cultures, even though in each case c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 activation occurred and was inhibited by CEP-1347. These observations suggest that some but not all death pathways triggered by different insults can include a common mechanistic component, a likely candidate for which is activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling cascade.",Excluded

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 1800-MHz RF at 208 muw/cm2 power density (SAR: 0.5762 W/kg) at different zeitgeber (ZT) periods of the day, including 0 (ZT0), 4 (ZT4), 8 (ZT8), 12 (ZT12), 16 (ZT16), and 20 (ZT20) h. RF exposure was 2 h/d for 32 d. From each rat, the concentrations of plasma MEL and testosterone were determined in plasma after RF exposure and compared with controls. The results confirmed the existence of circadian rhythms in the synthesis of MEL and testosterone, but revealed an inverse relationship in peak phase of these rhythms. These rhythms were disturbed after exposure to RF, with the effect being more pronounced on MEL than testosterone. The most pronounced effect of RF exposure on MEL and testosterone appears to be in rats exposed to RF at ZT 16 and ZT0 h, respectively. Data suggest that regulation of testosterone is controlled by MEL and that MEL is more sensitive to RF exposure.",Excluded

2930,"Using the combined model of gamma test and neuro-fuzzy system for modeling and estimating lead bonds in reservoir sediments Heavy metals attract a great deal of attention nowadays due to their potential accumulation in living creatures and transference in the food chain. Sediments of water reservoirs are considered to be a source of accumulation of these metals that develop in response to human activities and soil erosion. This study collected 180 samples of the surface sediments of water reservoir 1 at Chahnimeh in Sistan. Efficiency of the ANFIS model was evaluated to estimate the five bonds following the measurement of parameters in the laboratory. The following results were obtained for the parameters: organic carbon (OC) %, 0.31; cation exchange capacity (CEC), 37.07 Cmol kg; total Pb, 25.19 mg/kg; clay %, 45.87; and silt %, 39.02. These parameters were used as input for the training model. In the output layer, lead bonds were chosen as modeling targets in the following way: Pb f1 (4.61); Pb f2 (0.54); Pb f3 (16.28); Pb f4 (3.42); and Pb f5 (0.38) mg/kg. The best input compound in this model was chosen using the gamma test. From a total of 180, 88 data were considered for the model training section. Eventually, the neural-fuzzy model (subtractive clustering), developed for the prediction of lead bonds in the studied region, was able to account for over 99% of lead bonds in the sediments; considering statistical criteria of root mean squares error or RMSE (0.0337-0.0813) and determination coefficient or R<sup>2</sup> (0.92-0.99), this model showed good performance with regard to prediction.",Excluded
2957,"Role of hippocampal Cav1.2 Ca2+ channels in NMDA receptor-independent synaptic plasticity and spatial memory Current knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-independent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus and its function for memory formation in the behaving animal is limited. NMDAR-independent LTP in the CA1 region is thought to require activity of postsynaptic L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (Cav1.x), but the underlying channel isoform remains unknown. We evaluated the function of the Cav1.2 L-type Ca2+ channel for spatial learning, synaptic plasticity, and triggering of learning-associated biochemical processes using a mouse line with an inactivation of the CACNA1C (Cav1.2) gene in the hippocampus and neocortex (Cav1.2(HCKO)). This model shows (1) a selective loss of protein synthesis-dependent NMDAR-independent Schaffer collateral/CA1 late-phase LTP (L-LTP), (2) a severe impairment of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, and (3) decreased activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and reduced cAMP response element (CRE)-dependent transcription in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our results provide strong evidence for a role of L-type Ca2+ channel-dependent, NMDAR-independent hippocampal L-LTP in the formation of spatial memory in the behaving animal and for a function of the MAPK/CREB (CRE-binding protein) signaling cascade in linking Cav1.2 channel-mediated Ca2+ influx to either process.",Excluded

3007,"Sparing of cochleae and eyes in whole brain radiation therapy with boost by helical tomotherapy and noncoplanar VMAT Purpose/Objective: Simple low conformity lateral opposing radiation beams with limited sparing to proximal organs-atrisk (OARs) were widely adopted in the past for treating palliative whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Crucial OARs located at skull base used to sacrifice with significant radiation dose inevitably. More conformal radiation treatments, like helical tomotherapy (HT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), are becoming more accepted to treat WBRT. These techniques allow not only conformal dose to the whole brain but also simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) doses to dedicated metastases for superior disease control and symptom relief. This study aimed to investigate any potential advantages in cochleae and eyes sparing between HT and non-coplanar VMAT. Material(s) and Method(s): Treatment planning computed tomography (CT) scans of 15 brain metastasis patients who had received palliative dose WBRTs with SIBs to the metastases in the department were recruited. Each patient was re-planned with HT and non-coplanar VMAT for dosimetric comparison. Departmental routine optimal settings with fan beam thickness of 2.5cm and pitch value of 0.287 were used in all HT plans. One coplanar full arc plus two non-coplanar half arcs modulating by Varian Millennium 120 MLCs were used in all VMAT plans. The two non-coplanar half arcs were arranged at 60 degrees offset to each other and to the coplanar full arc to cover the cranial hemisphere. All target volumes were optimized according to original prescriptions. The median whole brain dose was 30Gy (range 25-40Gy) and the median SIB dose was 35Gy (range 30-45Gy). The mean SIB volume was 26.7+/-30.4cc consisting 1.7+/-1.8% of the whole brain volume 1481.8+/-161.1cc. Radiation doses to cochleae and eyes were studied by comparing their maximum doses (Dmax) and mean doses (Dmean). The dose results from the two techniques were tested statistically by paired t-test considering significant level of p-value <0.05. Result(s): The dose results are listed in Table 1. Non-coplanar VMAT significantly achieved lower Dmax and Dmean to both cochleae than HT (all p<0.001). Radiation doses to both eyes were slightly higher in non-coplanar VMAT than in HT but could not be shown statistically significant (all p>0.05). However, the Dmax and Dmean to both lens were significantly higher in non-coplanar VMAT than in HT (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). Conclusion(s): Non-coplanar VMAT is superior to HT in sparing cochleae which are relatively small and highly proximal to target volumes. There is no significant dose difference in eyes sparing for both techniques. Non-coplanar VMAT is preferred to treat WBRT with SIB if slight increase in lens doses is not a concern.

3175,"Iodinated contrast agent time course in human brain metastasis: A study for synchrotron stereotactic radiotherapy clinical trials Purpose/Objective(s): Synchrotron stereotactic radiotherapy (SSRT) is an innovative treatment combining the selective accumulation of heavy elements in tumors with stereotactic irradiations using monochromatic medium energy x-rays from a synchrotron source. Phase I/II clinical trials on brain metastasis are underway using venous infusion of iodinated contrast agents. The radiation dose enhancement depends on the amount of iodine in the tumor and its time course. Quantitative, post-infusion iodine bio-distribution and associated brain perfusion parameters were studied in human brain metastasis as key parameters for treatment feasibility and quality. The reproducibility of iodine concentrations between the recruitment day and the treatment day was assessed in order to predict dose errors. Materials/Methods: Twelve patients received an intravenous bolus of iodinated contrast agent (40 mL, 4 mL/s), followed by a steady-state infusion (160 mL, 0.5 mL/s) in order to ensure stable intratumoral amounts of iodine during the treatment. Absolute iodine concentrations and quantitative perfusion maps were derived from 40 multi-slice dynamic conventional CT images of the brain (recruitment day) or from quantitative synchrotron radiation CT (treatment day). For three of these patients, iodine concentrations reached in the tumor were compared between the recruitment day and the treatment day (~ 10 days interval). Result(s): The post-infusion mean intratumoral iodine concentration (over thirty minutes) reached 1.94 +/- 0.12 mg/mL. Reasonable correlations were obtained between these concentrations and the permeability surface area product and the cerebral blood volume. Iodine concentrations were reproducible leading to dose errors in the radiotherapy standards. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study of contrast agent biodistribution versus time in brain metastasis. The study demonstrates that suitable and stable amounts of iodine can be reached in brain metastasis for SSRT treatment. Moreover, the associated perfusion measurements provide useful information for the patient recruitment and management processes.",Excluded

3386,"Development of the gravity sensing system The utricle and saccule contain hair cells, which are the peripheral sensors of change in gravity that transmit signals regarding these changes to the neural components of the vestibular system. Although the fundamental neural pathways, especially the vestibular reflex pathways, have been investigated extensively, the principals underlying the functional development of this system are under study at present. The objective of this review is to identify the gravity-sensing components of the vestibular system and to present an overview of the research performed on their development. The second part of this review is focused on one important aspect of development, the emergence of electrical excitability using the chick tangential vestibular nucleus as a model. The importance of this research to understanding vestibular compensation and vestibular disturbance during spaceflight is considered. Because there is a conservation of the fundamental pathways and function in vertebrate phylogeny from birds through mammals, findings from studies on avians should contribute significantly to understanding the mechanisms operating in mammals. Also, we expect that as the events and basic mechanisms underlying normal vestibular development are revealed, these will provide practical tools to investigate the pattern of recovery from dysfunction of the vestibular system. This is related to the evidence suggesting that recovery of function in different systems and cell lines, including neurons, involves repeating certain patterns established during development. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded

Sixteen patients with squamous carcinoma of the cervix were prospectively treated in a Phase I study. All tumors were stages IIb, IIIb, or IVa with diameters of > or = 7 cm. Patients underwent surgical staging with pelvic and paraortic lymphadenectomy with placement of bilateral intra-arterial catheters in the anterior division of the internal iliac arteries. The catheters terminated in separate subcutaneous ports. No patient had metastasis in the high common iliac or paraortic nodes. Patients received a planned course of 40-50 Gy whole pelvis XRT followed by indicated brachytherapy. During the first 2 weeks of whole pelvis XRT, patients received a 1-hr infusion of FUDR and during the second 2 weeks a 1-hr infusion of cisplatin, each delivered daily by external pump with the daily whole pelviS XRT fraction. Additional cisplatin was infused during brachytherapy. Five dose levels ranging from 6.5 to 27 mg/m2 daily for FUDR and from 2 to 8 mg/m2 daily for cisplatin were used.

3540,"Tolerances on MLC leaf position accuracy for IMRT delivery with a dynamic MLC The objective determination of performance standards for radiation therapy equipment requires, ideally, establishing the quantitative relationship between performance deviations and clinical outcome or some acceptable surrogate. In this simulation study the authors analyzed the dosimetric impact of random (leaf by leaf) and systematic (entire leaf bank) errors in the position of the MLC leaves on seven clinical prostate and seven clinical head and neck IMRT plans delivered using a dynamic MLC. In-house software was developed to incorporate normally distributed errors of up to +/- 2 mm in individual leaf position or systematic errors (+/- 1 and +/- 0.5 mm in all leaves of both leaf banks or +1 mm in one bank only) into the 14 plans, thus simulating treatment delivery using a suboptimally performing MLC. The dosimetric consequences of suboptimal MLC performance were quantified using the equivalent uniform doses (EUDs) of the clinical target volumes and important organs at risk (OARs). The deviation of the EUDs of the selected structures as the performance of the MLC deteriorated was used as the objective surrogate of clinical outcome. Random errors of 2 mm resulted in negligible changes for all structures of interest in both sites. In contrast, systematic errors can lead to potentially significant dosimetric changes that may compromise clinical outcome. If a 2% change in EUD of the target and 2 Gy for the OARs were adopted as acceptable levels of deviation in dose due to MLC effects alone, then systematic errors in leaf position will need to be limited to 0.3 mm. This study provides guidance, based on a dosimetric surrogate of clinical outcome, for the development of one component, leaf position accuracy of performance standards for multileaf collimators.",Excluded
2698,"Acute Effect of Low-Dose Space Radiation on Mouse Retina and Retinal Endothelial Cells There is concern that degradation of vision as a result of space flight may compromise both mission goals and long-term quality of life after space travel. The visual disturbances may be due to a combination of intracerebral pressure changes and exposure to ionizing radiation. The retina and the retinal vasculature play important roles in vision, yet have not been studied extensively in relationship to space travel and space radiation. The goal of the current study was to characterize oxidative damage and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells after whole-body gamma-ray, proton and oxygen (<sup>16</sup>O) ion radiation exposure at 0.1 to 1 Gy. Six-month-old male C57Bl/6J mice were whole-body irradiated with 600 MeV/n <sup>16</sup>O ions (0, 0.1, 0.25, 1 Gy), solar particle event (SPE)-like protons (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 Gy) or <sup>60</sup>Co gamma rays (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 Gy). Eyes were isolated for examining endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and characterization of apoptosis in retina and retinal endothelial cells at two weeks postirradiation.

TUNEL assays showed dose-dependent increases in apoptosis in the retina after irradiation. Low doses of <sup>16</sup>O ions elicited apoptosis in the mouse retinal endothelial cells with the most robust changes observed after 0.1 Gy irradiation ( P < 0.05) compared to controls. Data also showed that <sup>16</sup>O ions induced a higher frequency of apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells compared to protons ( P < 0.05).

Significant changes in retinal endothelial cells occur at doses as low as 0.1 Gy. There were significant differences in the responses of endothelial cells among the radiation types examined here.",Included
3241,"Measured attenuation correction methods Accurate attenuation correction is a prerequisite for the determination of exact local radioactivity concentrations in positron emission tomography. Attenuation correction factors range from 4-5 in brain studies to 50-100 in whole body measurements. This report gives an overview of the different methods of determining the attenuation correction factors by transmission measurements using an external positron emitting source. The long-lived generator nuclide 68Ge/68Ga is commonly used for this purpose. The additional patient dose from the transmission source is usually a small fraction of the dose due to the subsequent emission measurement. Ring-shaped transmission sources as well as rotating point or line sources are employed in modern positron tomographs. By masking a rotating line or point source, random and scattered events in the transmission scans can be effectively suppressed. The problems of measured attenuation correction are discussed: transmission/emission mismatch, random and scattered event contamination, counting statistics, transmission/emission scatter compensation, transmission scan after administration of activity to the patient. By using a double masking technique simultaneous emission and transmission scans become feasible.",Excluded

The planning treatment volume (PTV) included all the bones from head to mid femur except for upper extremities. Evaluated organs at risk (OAR) consisted of lung, liver, heart, kidneys, and brain. The following treatment parameters were used to generate the TMI plans: field widths of 2.5 and 5 cm, modulation factors of 2 and 2.5, and pitch of either 0.287 or 0.43. The optimization parameters were chosen based on the PTV and OAR priorities and the plans were optimized with a fixed number of iterations. The PTV constraint was selected to ensure that at least 95% of the PTV received the prescription dose. The plans were evaluated based on D80 and D50 (dose to 80% and 50% of the OAR volume, respectively) and hotspot volumes within the PTVs. Gamma indices (GAMMA) were also used to compare planar dose distributions between the two modalities. The optimization and dose calculation times were compared between the two systems. The treatment delivery times were also evaluated.RESULTS: The results showed very good dosimetric agreement between the GPU and CPU calculated plans for any of the evaluated planning parameters indicating that both systems converge on nearly identical plans. All D80 and D50 parameters varied by less than 3% of the prescription dose with an average difference of 0.8%. A gamma analysis GAMMA(3%, 3 mm) < 1 of the GPU plan resulted in over 90% of calculated voxels satisfying GAMMA < 1 criterion as compared to baseline CPU plan. The average number of voxels meeting the GAMMA < 1 criterion for all the plans was 97%. In terms of dose optimization/calculation efficiency, there was a 20-fold reduction in planning time with the new GPU system. The average optimization/dose calculation time utilizing the traditional CPU/cluster based system was 579 vs 26.8 min for the GPU based system. There was no difference in the calculated treatment delivery time per fraction. Beam-on time varied based on field width and pitch and ranged between 15 and 28 min.CONCLUSIONS: The TomoTherapy GPU based dose engine is capable of calculating TMI treatment plans with plan quality nearly identical to plans calculated using the traditional CPU/cluster based system, while significantly reducing the time required for optimization and dose calculation.",Excluded

We investigated whether these radiation modalities improves the survival of patients with GBM. Sixty-eight cases of newly diagnosed GBM have been treated in our institution. After surgery, radiation therapy was performed using CRT with a dose of 60.0-61.2 Gy (n=36), hyperfractionated PBT concomitant with fractionated photon irradiation with a total dose of 96.6 Gy (n=17), or a single fraction of BNCT (n=15). In PBT, the surrounding volume of 2 cm from main tumor mass and the volume of perifocal edema were irradiated at dose of 75.6 and 60 Gy, respectively. The median OS time of the case series of BNCT for GBM has been reported as 13-20.7 M. In this study, the median OS and median time to MR change (TTM) for all patients were 25.7 and 11.9 M, respectively. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 85.7% and 45.5%, respectively. On the other hand, in the patients who underwent CRT and ACNU-based chemotherapy, OS and 2-year survival rate were 14.2M and 17.9%, respectively. In the patients who underwent high-dose PBT, OS and 2-year survival rate were 21.3M and 38.5%, respectively. The present small case series of selected patients showed survival benefit after BNCT. The comparison using previously reported prognostic factor-based classifications suggest that outcome of BNCT in terms of survival appeared to have non-inferiority compared to the standard therapy. With respect to the case series as a high-dose radiation trial, the outcome (OS: 9.5-25 M) of previously reported may still be comparable to that of BNCT.

3399,"Treg/Tcon Immunotherapy and High Dose Marrow Irradiation Ensure Full Control of Leukemia Relapse in Haploidentical Transplantation Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the most powerful therapy for patients with high risk of relapse. In spite of that, no matter the donor source or conditioning regimen used, leukemia relapse is still the leading cause of HSCT failure. In HLA-haploidentical HSCT, we recently applied a clinical protocol consisting of total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning regimen and a peripheral blood CD34+ cell graft combined with the adoptive transfer of naturally occurring regulatory T cells (Tregs) and conventional T cells (Tcons). No post-transplant pharmacologic GvHD prophylaxis was given. Such protocol was associated with low GvHD and relapse rate (Martelli et al., Blood 2014). To further reduce leukemia relapse in Treg/Tcon-based haploidentical HSCT (Treg/Tcon haplo-HSCT) we used high dose hyper-fractionated TBI (HF-TBI) in the conditioning regimen. We also extended Treg/Tcon haplo-HSCT to patients that are unfit (because of previous comorbidities) and/or too old to withstand high intensity regimens. In these patients the extra-hematologic toxicity of irradiation was reduced with the use of targeted total marrow and lymph node irradiation (TMLI). 40 patients with high risk acute leukemia (36 AML, 4 ALL) received Treg/Tcon haplo-HSCT. All but 3 patients were transplanted in complete remission. 12 younger patients (median age: 28, range: 20-43) received HF-TBI, while 28 older or unfit patients (59, 40-70) received TMLI in the conditioning regimen. HF-TBI (14.4 Gy) was administered in 12 fractions, 3 times a day for 4 days. TMLI was administered by means of Helical Tomotherapy HI-ART (9 fractions, 2 times a day for 4.5 days). Irradiation was followed by chemotherapy with Thiotepa, Fludarabine, and Cyclophosphamide. 2 x 10<sup>6</sup>/kg freshly isolated CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs were transferred 4 days before the infusion of 1 x 10<sup>6</sup>/kg Tcons and a mega-dose of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. No post-transplant pharmacologic GvHD prophylaxis was given. 38/40 patients engrafted. 12 (31%) developed aGvHD grade 32 (10 are alive and off-therapy). 6 (16%) died because of transplant related complications (2 because of aGvHD, 2 infections, 1 veno-occlusive disease, 1 intracranial hemorrhage). Strikingly, despite the high risk diseases, no patient relapsed after a median follow up of 13 months (range 1-36, Fig. A). Further, only 1 patient developed cGvHD. Thus, cGvHD/Leukemia-free survival was 82% (Fig. B). Treg adoptive transfer allows for the safe infusion of an otherwise lethal dose of donor alloreactive Tcons in the absence of any other form of immune suppression.

2518,"Cumulative genetic damage in hematopoietic stem cells in a patient with a 40-year exposure to alpha particles emitted by thorium dioxide Thorotrast, a colloidal suspension of the long-lived radionuclide, thorium-232, was widely used as a radiographic contrast medium for several decades. Due to the poor excretion of the sol, however, Thorotrast would deposit in the liver, bone marrow and other tissue, and patients would receive alpha-particle irradiation for life. To gauge the cumulative genetic damage to hematopoietic stem cells due to chronic exposure to alpha particles, we conducted a multi-end-point evaluation in a 72-year-old man who had been administered a 32-ml bolus of Thorotrast during cerebral angiography performed over 40 years ago in 1950. Peripheral T lymphocytes were cultured to quantify the frequencies and cellular distributions of asymmetrical and symmetrical types of chromosome aberrations in first-division metaphases and micronuclei in cytokinesis-arrested interphase II cells. Aberrations were scored using classical chromosome group analysis methods and chromosome painting techniques. Assays of glycophorin-A (GPA) mutations in red blood cells were also performed to obtain a relative measurement of damage sustained by the erythroid stem cell population. Results revealed that approximately 30% of the lymphocytes in this patient contained one or more chromosome aberrations, the majority of which were of the ""stable"" type. About one-third of the lymphocytes with chromosome damage carried multiple aberrations, suggesting that significant numbers of stem cells survive exposures to alpha-particle radiation that induce complex genomic alterations. Increased frequencies of GPA mutations were observed, demonstrating that genomic damage is also induced in erythroid progenitors. The numbers of micronuclei in lymphocytes were only moderately increased compared to expected values for persons of comparable age, and thus this end point was not useful for quantifying exposure level. Despite the relatively severe burden of somatic cell damage induced by 40 years of internal alpha-particle irradiation, the patient remains surprisingly free of any serious illness.",Excluded
3522,"A prospective evaluation of the effects of chronic proton pump inhibitor use on plasma biomarker levels in humans Introduction: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used primarily to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease. PPI-induced achlorhydria increases circulating gastrin and chromogranin A (CGA). CGA is a widely used biomarker for the diagnosis and follow-up for gut-based neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). PPI-induced increases in CGA or gastrin may falsely suggest the presence of a NET when none exists. Pancreastatin, a fragment of CGA, is also commonly used to diagnose and follow NETs. Aim(s): We hypothesized that chronic PPI use would increase circulating plasma gastrin, CGA and pancreastatin levels. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty patients who used PPIs for six months or more (mean duration 3.1 +/-2.5 years) and a separate control group of thirty patients who never used antacid medications were prospectively evaluated with plasma gastrin, CGA and pancreastatin determinations. Result(s): Chronic PPI use resulted in significant increases in CGA (15.1+/-11 vs. 131+/-207 ng/ml, p=0.005) and significant increases in gastrin (34.8+/-22.3 vs. 167.8+/-136.2 pg/ml, p=0.001) compared to controls. In contrast, pancreastatin level in non-users and chronic PPI users were identical (81.6+/-36.4 vs.89.4+/-43.4 pg/ml, p=0.46). Conclusion(s): Pancreastatin levels do not change with chronic PPI use and normal pancreastatin levels may be used to distinguish between druginduced changes in biomarkers and tumor-related increases in circulating biomarkers.",Excluded
3252,"Delayed central nervous system irradiation effects in rats--part 2: aggravation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis BACKGROUND: Central nervous system (CNS) irradiation has detrimental effects which become evident within hours to few days and after a long latency of months and years. However, the delayed effect of irradiation on neuroimmune diseases has not been thoroughly examined.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the delayed effects of irradiation on the course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is used as a model for neuroimmune inflammation and multiple sclerosis.METHODS: Adult male rats were exposed to a dose of 15 Gy given to the thoracolumbar spinal cord. Six months later, EAE was induced by inoculation of rat spinal cord homogenate in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The disease was evaluated by clinical, histopathological and immunological parameters.RESULTS: Irradiated rats developed clinical signs of EAE earlier than the control group and their disease was much more severe. Unlike the control group, all rats in the EAE-irradiated group died within 5 days after the onset of clinical signs. Sections taken from irradiated rats showed diffuse and large hemorrhagic infiltrates of lymphocytes and granulocytes. In contrast, control rats displayed fewer infiltrates, which were less prominent and not hemorrhagic.CONCLUSIONS: CNS irradiation has a delayed effect that caused a marked aggravation of the clinical and pathological signs of EAE. The severity of the disease may be a consequence of the effect of irradiation on the CNS vascular bed and impaired blood-brain barrier.",Included

Cognitive function was assessed 5 days/week for 4 months prior to fractionated whole-brain irradiation and for 11 months after irradiation using a Delayed-Match-to-Sample (DMS) task at both low and high cognitive loads. Local rates of cerebral glucose metabolism were measured prior to and 9 months after irradiation using [(18)F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography. Low cognitive load trials did not reveal a significant reduction in performance until 7 months after irradiation; performance then declined progressively. In high cognitive load trials, the initial impairment was observed ~1 month after irradiation. This was followed by a transient recovery period over the next 1-2 months, after which performance declined progressively through 11 months after irradiation. Nine months after irradiation, glucose uptake during the DMS task was decreased in the cuneate and prefrontal cortex and was increased in the cerebellum and thalamus compared with the levels prior to irradiation. Results from this pilot study suggest that the radiation-induced changes in cognition and brain metabolism observed in rhesus monkeys may be similar to those observed in brain tumor patients receiving brain irradiation.",Included

2763,"Prognostic factors in glioblastoma multiforme patients receiving high-dose particle radiotherapy or conventional radiotherapy The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of prognostic factors related to patient selection on survival outcomes. Survival outcomes were retrospectively analysed in a consecutive series of 67 newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients who had received either conventional fractionated photon radiotherapy (CRT) or high-dose particle radiotherapy (HDT). In the CRT protocol, a total dose of 60.0-61.2 Gy was administered. In the HDT protocol, an average dose of approximately 30 GyE in a single session and additional fractionated photon irradiation of total dose 30 Gy were administered to patients receiving boron neutron capture therapy; and a total dose of 96.6 GyE was administered to patients receiving proton therapy. Most of the patients had received chemotherapy with nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) alone or with ACNU, procarbazine and vincristine. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival times for all patients were 17.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 14.6-20.9 months] and 7.8 months (95% CI, 5.7-9.9 months), respectively. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 67.2% and 33.7%, respectively. For patients treated with HDT, the median OS was 24.4 months (95% CI, 18.2-30.5 months), compared with 14.2 months (95% CI, 10.0-18.3 months) for those treated with CRT. The Cox proportional hazards model revealed radiation modality (HDT vs CRT) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer recursive partitioning analysis class to be the significant prognostic factors. Age, sex, pre-operative performance status, treatment with or without advanced neuroimaging, extent of surgery and regimen of chemotherapy were not statistically significant factors in predicting prognosis. The median OS was 18.5 months (95% CI, 9.9-27.1 months) in patients of 65 years and older, compared with 16.8 months (95% CI, 13.6-20.1 months) in those 64 years and younger (p=0.871). The positive effect of HDT treatment is unlikely to reflect patient selection alone.

The first 6 patients received IMA950 (9 major histocompatibility complex [MHC] class I and 2 MHC class II peptides) intradermally and poly-ICLC intramuscularly (i.m.). After protocol amendment, IMA950 and poly-ICLC were mixed and injected subcutaneously (n = 7) or i.m. (n = 6). Primary endpoints were safety and immunogenicity. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival at 6 and 9 months, and vaccine-specific peripheral cluster of differentiation (CD)4 and CD8 T-cell responses.RESULTS: The IMA950/poly-ICLC vaccine was safe and well tolerated. Four patients presented cerebral edema with rapid recovery. For the first 6 patients, vaccine-induced CD8 T-cell responses were restricted to a single peptide and CD4 responses were absent. After optimization of vaccine formulation, we observed multipeptide CD8 and sustained T helper 1 CD4 T-cell responses. For the entire cohort, CD8 T-cell responses to a single or multiple peptides were observed in 63.2% and 36.8% of patients, respectively.

2863,"Palliative radiation for spinal metastases: Does the presence of soft tissue disease affect the choice of treatment dose and fractionation? Purpose/Objective(s): Spinal bone metastases associated with soft tissue disease (ST) are frequently considered at higher risk of developing further complications such as neuropathic pain and cord compression. The objectives of our study were to describe the prevalence of ST in patients presenting for spine radiation therapy (XRT), and whether presence of soft tissue disease is associated with a difference in treatment approach compared with those whose do not (nST). Materials/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed records of all consecutive patients receiving spine XRT within our palliative radiation program during 2012. Patient demographics, symptoms intensity, performance status and life expectancy were captured at the time of consultation. Diagnostic imaging including CT +/- MRI as well as planning CT relevant to the course of treatment were reviewed to document whether ST, cord compression (CC) or compression fracture (CF) was present at the levels being irradiated. Whether a field based or volume based approach was employed by the radiation oncologist to define the treatment plan was recorded. Binary logistic regression was used for inferences, using the generalized estimating equation approach to adjust the standard error to account for the correlation of observations within a patient. Result(s): One hundred fifty patients receiving 177 treatments were reviewed. This included 19 patients receiving simultaneous treatment to 2 separate sites and 4 patients receiving treatment to 3 sites. The mean age was 64 years. 71% (106/150) of patients in both groups were estimated to have a life expectancy of over 6 months. Fifty-five percent of treatments given were in the lumbosacral area. Nocomplicating radiological features (i.e., noST, CC, CF) was present in 89/177 (50%) of cases. ST was present in 50/177 cases [28% [95% CI 25-32%)]. Of these,32%(16/50) also had aCCand 32%(16/50) had aCF. There were no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex distribution and source of primary. The proportion of patients with severe pain (>5 on a scale of 0-10) was 46% ST and 60% nST (p = 0.82). Volume based planning was employed for 58% ST and 48% nST. Fractionated treatments (mostly 20 Gy/ 5 fractions) were employed in 84% ST and 66% nST of cases. After adjustment for CC and CF, there was a trend to suggest physicians were more likely to prescribe fractionated treatments in cases with ST (p =0.16). Conclusion(s): Fifty percent of treatment courses delivered to spine were associated with some complicating radiological features including ST, SC or CF. ST was present in 28% cases. We were unable to identify any clinical features that would predict for the presence of ST disease.

3393,"Frameless stereotaxy in subthalamic deep brain stimulation: 3-year clinical outcome Background: In most centers, the surgery of deep brain stimulation (DBS) is performed using a stereotactic frame. Compared with frame-based technique, frameless stereotaxy reduces the duration of surgical procedure and patient's discomfort, with lead placing accuracy equivalent after the learning curve. Although several studies have investigated the targeting accuracy of this technique, only a few studies reported clinical outcomes, with data of short-term follow-up. Objective(s): To assess clinical efficacy and safety of frameless bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients at 1- and 3-year follow-up. Method(s): Consecutive PD patients who underwent bilateral STN-DBS with a manual adjustable frameless system were included in the study. The data were collected retrospectively. Result(s): Eighteen PD patients underwent bilateral STN-DBS implant and were included in the study. All patients completed 1-year observation and ten of them completed 3-year observation. At 1-year follow-up, motor efficacy of STN stimulation in off-med condition was of 30.1% (P = 0.003) and at 3-year follow-up was of 36.3%, compared with off-stim condition at 3-year follow-up (P = 0.005). Dopaminergic drugs were significantly reduced by 31.2% 1 year after the intervention (P = 0.003) and 31.7% 3 years after the intervention (P = 0.04).

2732,"Neurocognitive functioning in adults who underwent nonmyeloablative hla-matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) for sickle cell disease (SCD) Background: Individuals with SCD are at risk for neurocognitive impairments. While potentially curative, SCTs come with their own risk of neurotoxicities, particularly from radiation and high-dose ablative chemotherapies. Newer, nonmyeloablative regimens may prevent some of these toxicities. This study examines the long-term cognitive impact of nonmyeloablative transplants in adults with SCD. Method(s): Seventeen adults (11 males; mean age = 32.2 years, SD=9.0, range 17-52) participated in neuropsychological evaluations before transplant and 12 months posttransplant, as part of a research protocol at the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. Donors were HLA-matched siblings; the conditioning regimen consisted of alemtuzumab and 300cGy total body irradiation, and they received sirolimus for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. Evaluations assessed global cognition, processing speed, memory, attention, and executive functions. Patients completed the PROMIS Physical Functioning questionnaire. Result(s): Global cognition was within normal limits. Mean Verbal and Performance IQ scores were average at baseline and follow-up, with no significant changes noted. Mean processing speed scores were average, and increased significantly from baseline (M=92.1, SD=10.1) to 12 months (M=99.2, SD=11.6, t=2.1, p=.013). Mean scores on memory, attention and executive tests were average and stable across time points. No group declines in mean cognitive scores were noted. Mean t-scores on the physical functioning questionnaire increased from 41.6 (SD=4.7) to 49.0 (SD=10.0; t=3.4, p=.01), indicating significant improvement from baseline to 12 months post-transplant. Hemoglobin levels increased significantly from pre-transplant (M=9.1, SD=0.9) to posttransplant (M=13.1, SD=2.2; t=8.9, p<=.0001). Conclusion(s): In this small sample, a comparison of neurocognitive scores from baseline to 12 months post-nonmyeloablative SCT does not indicate any deleterious effects from transplant. In fact, a significant improvement emerged in mental processing speed. Physical functioning also improved per patient questionnaires. As suggested by some prior research, the significant increase in hemoglobin levels may underlie improvements in processing speed.",Excluded
2743,"Fictive swimming motor patterns in wild type and mutant larval zebrafish Larval zebrafish provide a unique model for investigating the mechanisms involved in generating rhythmic patterns of behavior, such as swimming, due to the array of techniques available including genetics, optical imaging, and conventional electrophysiology. Because electrophysiological and imaging studies of rhythmic motor behaviors in paralyzed preparations depend on the ability to monitor the central motor pattern, we developed a fictive preparation in which the activity of axial motor neurons was monitored using extracellular recordings from peripheral nerves. We examined spontaneous and light induced fictive motor patterns in wild type and mutant larval zebrafish (4-6 days post-fertilization) paralyzed with curare. All spontaneous and light-induced preparations produced alternation of motor activity from side-to-side (mean contralateral phase = 50.7 +/- 7.0%; mean burst frequency = 35.6 +/- 4.7 Hz) and a progression of activity from head-to-tail (mean ipsilateral rostrocaudal delay = 0.8 +/- 0.5 ms per segment), consistent with lateral undulation and forward propulsion during swimming, respectively. The basic properties of the motor pattern were similar in spontaneous and light-induced swimming. This fictive preparation can be used in combination with conventional electrophysiological and imaging methods to investigate normal circuit function as well as to elucidate functional deficits in mutant lines. Toward this end, we show that two accordion class mutants, accordion and bandoneon, have alternating activity on opposite sides of the body, contradicting the hypothesis that their deficit results from the absence of the reciprocal glycinergic inhibition that is typically found in the spinal cord of swimming vertebrates.",Excluded

Ninety-seven patients presented with bleeding and 45 of these had at least two bleeding episodes. Thirteen patients presented with seizures combined with hemorrhage, and 15 patients presented with seizures alone. The mean margin dose of radiation was 12.1 Gy and the mean follow-up time was 5.4 years. In the 112 patients who had bled the number of rebleeds after GKS was 32. These rebleeds were defined both clinically and based on magnetic resonance imaging for an annual rebleeding rate of 32 episodes/492 patient-years or 6.5%. Twenty-three of the 32 rebleeding episodes occurred within 2 years after GKS. Nine episodes occurred after 2 years; thus, the annual rebleeding rate after GKS was 10.3% for the first 2 years and 3.3% thereafter (p = 0.0038). In the 45 patients with at least two bleeding episodes before GKS, the rebleeding rate dropped from 29.2% (55 episodes/188 patient-years) before treatment to 5% (10 episodes/197 patient-years) after treatment (p < 0.0001). Among the 28 patients who presented with seizures, 15 (53%) had good outcomes (Engel Grades I and II). In this study of 125 patients, symptomatic radiation-induced complications developed in only three patients.CONCLUSIONS: Gamma knife surgery can effectively reduce the rebleeding rate after the first symptomatic hemorrhage in patients with CH. In addition, GKS may be useful in reducing the severity of seizures in patients with CH.",Excluded
2446,"Transformation of benign metastasizing leiomyoma to leiomyosarcoma INTRODUCTION: Benign metastasizing leiomyoma (BML) is a rare entity in which solitary leiomyoma-like nodules are present in a distant location. The origin is presumed to be the uterus, occurring predominantly in women of reproductive age. It is extremely atypical for BML to undergo malignant transformation. Here we present a rare case of BML transforming to leiomyosarcoma. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a 53 year old female with a history of benign metastasizing leiomyoma (BML) who was admitted for dyspnea. She underwent a hysterectomy in 1996. That same year she suffered a spontaneous pneumothorax secondary to a ruptured lung cyst. In 2005 she underwent a left thoracotomy with resection of a new cystic lesion. Pathology was consistent with BML (positive for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, CD10, desmin, smooth muscle actin, caldesmon but negative for HMB-45 stain) and she was started on anastrazole. She underwent a redo thoracotomy in 2011 with resection of a pleural-based giant tumor; the pathology again confirmed BML. In January 2017 she was admitted for progressive shortness of breath, right shoulder pain and headache. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) brain showed a right superior frontal mass. Contrast tomography (CT) chest showed worsening of nodular densities without significant cystic changes (image1). A MRI of her right shoulder demonstrated a large mass at the lateral third of the clavicle. Subsequent positron emission tomography (PET) revealed extensive hyper-metabolic activity consistent with metastasis. The right frontal and right clavicular masses were biopsied and pathology was consistent with leiomyosarcoma (image 2). Unfortunately, she was not a candidate for chemotherapy or radiation and ultimately expired. DISCUSSION: BML is a rare disease entity with only 150 reported cases to date.1 The lungs are the most common site of metastatic spread. Radiographically BML appears as well-circumscribed, multiple solid nodules. Uncommonly, as seen in our patient, it can present as cavitation or cysts, increasing the risk for pneumothorax. Typically, the tumors maintain the benign nature of uterine leiomyomas as evidenced by their lack of avidity on PET and low mitotic activity.2 This is the third reported case of malignant transformation. Few guidelines exist for managing BML although current treatment includes surgical resection or hormone modulating therapies. CONCLUSION(S): Transformation of BML to leiomyosarcoma is uncommon.",Excluded
2766,"Serotonergic modulation of psychological stress-induced alteration in synaptic plasticity in the rat hippocampal CA1 field In order to elucidate possible involvement of the serotonergic neuronal system in the stress-induced alteration in synaptic plasticity, the effects of contextual fear conditioning (CFC) on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 field were examined in 5-HT-depleted rats by pretreatment with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT, 200 microg/rat, i.c.v.). LTP induction was suppressed by footshock (FS) stimulation in 5-HT-lesioned rats and vehicle-treated controls. When rats were exposed to CFC, which was received 24 h after FS stimulation, LTP was also blocked in both-treated groups. CFC-induced impairment of LTP, however, significantly attenuated in 5-HT-lesioned rats when compared with that in controls. Fear-related freezing behavior after FS stimulation occurred similarly in both treated groups, whereas the behavior observed during exposure to CFC significantly reduced in 5-HT-lesioned rats. These results suggest that the serotonergic mechanism is involved in the psychological stress-induced alteration in synaptic plasticity, which appears to be associated with fear-related behavior.",Excluded
2878,"Association Between Radiation Necrosis and Tumor Biology After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Metastasis BACKGROUND: The primary dose-limiting toxicity of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is radiation necrosis (RN), which occurs after approximately 5% to 10% of treatments. This adverse event may worsen neurologic deficits, increase the frequency and cost of imaging, and necessitate prolonged treatment with steroids or antiangiogenic agents. Previous investigations have primarily identified lesion size and dosimetric constraints as risk factors for RN in small populations. We hypothesized that disease histology, receptor status, and mutational status are associated with RN.METHODS AND MATERIALS: All patients presenting with brain metastasis between 1997 and 2015 who underwent SRS and subsequent radiographic follow-up at a single tertiary-care institution were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of radiographic RN. Multivariate competing risks regression was used to identify biological risk factors for RN.RESULTS: 1939 patients (5747 lesions) were eligible for inclusion; 285 patients (15%) experienced radiographic RN after the treatment of 427 (7%) lesions. After SRS, the median time to RN was 7.6 months. After multivariate analysis, graded prognostic assessment, renal pathology, lesion diameter, and the heterogeneity index remained independently predictive of RN in the pooled cohort. In subset analyses of individual pathologies, HER2-amplified status (hazard ratio [HR] 2.05, P=.02), BRAF V600+ mutational status (HR 0.33, P=.04), lung adenocarcinoma histology (HR 1.89, P=.04), and ALK rearrangement (HR 6.36, P<.01) were also associated with RN.CONCLUSIONS: In the present investigation constituting the largest series of RN, several novel risk factors were identified, including renal histology, lung adenocarcinoma histology, HER2 amplification, and ALK/BRAF mutational status. These risk factors may be used to guide clinical trial design incorporating biological risk stratification or dose escalation. Future studies determining the optimal timing of targeted therapies are warranted to further define the risk of RN.",Excluded
2814,"Evaluating DNA damage in rodent brain after acute 60 Hz magnetic-field exposure In recent years, numerous studies have reported a weak association between 60 Hz magnetic-field exposure and the incidence of certain cancers. To date, no mechanism to explain these findings has been identified. The objective of the current study was to investigate whether acute magnetic-field exposure could elicit DNA damage within brain cells from both whole brain and cerebellar homogenates from adult rats, adult mice and immature mice. Rodents were exposed to a 60 Hz magnetic field (0, 0.1, 1 or 2 mT) for 2 h. Then, at 0, 2 and 4 h after exposure, animals were killed humanely, their brains were rapidly removed and homogenized, and cells were cast into agarose gels for processing by the alkaline comet assay. Four parameters (tail ratio, tail moment, comet length and tail length) were used to assess DNA damage for each comet. For each species, a significant increase in DNA damage was detected by each of the four parameters in the positive control (2 Gy X rays) relative to the concurrent nonirradiated negative and sham controls. However, none of the four parameters detected a significant increase in DNA damage in brain cell homogenates from any magnetic-field exposure (0- 2 mT) at any time after exposure. The dose-response and time-course data from the multiple animal groups tested in this study provide no evidence of magnetic-field-induced DNA damage.",Excluded

In consideration of these trends, the objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety of transcranial laser therapy with continuous-wave (CW) near-infrared laser light (wavelength, 808 +/- 10 nm, 2-mm diameter) with a nominal radiant power of 70 mW; power density, 2,230 mW/cm(2), and energy density, 268 J/cm(2) at the scalp (10 mW/cm(2) and 1.2 J/cm(2) at the cerebral cortical surface) in healthy Sprague-Dawley rats.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 120 anesthetized rats received sequential transcranial laser treatments to the right and left parietal areas of the head on the same day (minimum of 5 min between irradiation of each side), on either Day 1 or on each of Days 1, 3, and 5. Sixty anesthetized rats served as sham controls. Rats were evaluated 1 year after treatment for abnormalities in clinical hematology and brain and pituitary gland histopathology.RESULTS: No toxicologically important differences were found in the clinical hematology results between sham-control and laser-treated rats for any hematologic parameters examined. All values fell within historic control reference ranges for aged Sprague-Dawley rats. Similarly, brain and pituitary gland histopathology showed no treatment-related abnormalities or induced neoplasia.CONCLUSIONS: Single and multiple applications of transcranial laser therapy with 808-nm CW laser light at a nominal power density of 10 mW/cm(2) at the surface of the cerebral cortex appears to be safe in Sprague-Dawley rats 1 year after treatment.",Excluded
2996,"Transmission of signals between irradiated and non-irradiated organisms: Mechanisms and significance Inter-animal signaling from irradiated to non-irradiated organisms has been demonstrated for whole body irradiated mice and also for fish. Endpoints studied include clastogenic damage, and reproductive cell death. For fish, proteomic data has also been produced showing the induction of a protective proteome in both medaka and rainbow trout. The aim of the current study was to determine the effect of medical microbeam irradiation using the ESRF synchrotron at Grenoble to the right brain hemisphere of the rat to determine whether abscopal effects could be produced in the rest of the animal and also in cage mates housed with it. The results show strong signal production in the contralateral brain hemisphere with less strong effects in the distant bladder of the irradiated rats. Signal strength was the same or stronger in the cage mates housed for 48 hrs with the irradiated rats. The proteomic study showed that the abscopal-associated proteins included A. an increase in the expression of NADH dehydrogenase, aconitase, ubiquinone and Glial fibrillary acid proteins, which are known to be present in gliomas, B. a reduction of the Prohibitin protein, which is thought to be a tumor suppressor in humans C. an increase on the expression of Heat shock cognate 71kDa protein, which is known to be involved in the disassembly of clarithin-coated vesicles and D. a decrease in the expression of Tubulin alpha-1A chain protein, which is known to be one of the major components of microtubules. All of these proteins would suggest a pro-carcinogenesis proteome. However in the cage mates, tubulin and aconitase were present but in different isoforms, HSP 71 was also induced. Significantly, pyruvate kinase, fructose biphosphate and aldolase were also present, suggesting mobilization of energy reserves. This also happened in the bystander fish. One brain specific protein which was suppressed in the cage mate brain is dihydropyrimidinase. This protein is prone to oxidation and the oxidised molecule is associated with Alzheimer's disease. A reduction could be seen as beneficial in terms of reducing the overall extent of oxidased dihydropyrimidinase. On the other hand dihydropyrimidinase is a vital neurotransmitter so a reduction could also be seen as detrimental to cognitive brain function. Whatever way the induced changes in the cage mates influence the health of the animals, it is very clear that proximity to an irradiated animal induces proteomic changes in an unirradiated partner. The transmitting agent in fish and rats is thought to be urine. If similar signaling occurs between humans, the results could have implications for caregivers and hospital staff treating radiotherapy patients.",Included

3273,"swLORETA: A novel approach to robust source localization and synchronization tomography Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) is a widely used technique for source localization. However, this technique still has some limitations, especially under realistic noisy conditions and in the case of deep sources. To overcome these problems, we present here swLORETA, an improved version of sLORETA, obtained by incorporating a singular value decomposition-based lead field weighting. We show that the precision of the source localization can further be improved by a tomographic phase synchronization analysis based on swLORETA. The phase synchronization analysis turns out to be superior to a standard linear coherence analysis, since the latter cannot distinguish between real phase locking and signal mixing. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Excluded

2613,"Schizophrenia-like behavioral changes after partial hippocampal kindling The effect of hippocampal kindling on behavioral changes following 10 and 21 hippocampal afterdischarges (ADs) or electrographic seizures was examined in behaving rats. As compared to control, non-stimulated rats, 21 but not 10 hippocampal ADs resulted in a decrease in social contact, an increase in social isolation, and an increase in climbing and chasing behavior tested in an open field 3 days after cessation of kindling. Porsolt forced swimming test was not different among the control, 10- or 21-AD groups of rats. A deficit in sensorimotor gating, measured by prepulse inhibition of an acoustic startle, was observed in kindled as compared to control rats at 2 weeks after 21 ADs, but not after 10 ADs. Similarly, methamphetamine (1 mg/kg i.p.) induced higher locomotor activity in kindled rats, as compared to controls, after 21 ADs but not after 10 ADs. Spontaneous locomotor activity in a novel cage, without drug administration, was not different between kindled and control rats. These findings suggest that behavioral alterations after repeated hippocampal electrographic seizures may be mediated by increased dopaminergic functions, which may also mediate the psychiatric symptoms in human epileptic patients.",Excluded
2621,"Color constancy of color-deficient observers under illuminations defined by individual color discrimination ellipsoids We explored the color constancy mechanisms of color-deficient observers under red, green, blue, and yellow illuminations. The red and green illuminations were defined individually by the longer axis of the color discrimination ellipsoid measured by the Cambridge Colour Test. Four dichromats (3 protanopes and 1 deuteranope), two anomalous trichromats (2 deuteranomalous observers), and five color-normal observers were asked to complete the color constancy task by making a simultaneous paper match under asymmetrical illuminations in haploscopic view on a monitor. The von Kries adaptation model was applied to estimate the cone responses. The model fits showed that for all color-deficient observers under all illuminations, the adjustment of the S-cone response or blue-yellow chromatically opponent responses modeled with the simple assumption of cone deletion in a certain type (S-M, S-L or S-(L+M)) was consistent with the principle of the von Kries model. The degree of adaptation was similar to that of color-normal observers. The results indicate that the color constancy of color-deficient observers is mediated by the simplified blue-yellow color system with a von Kries-type adaptation effect, even in the case of brightness match, as well as by a possible cone-level adaptation to the S-cone when the illumination produces a strong S-cone stimulation, such as blue illumination.",Excluded
2571,"Performance and brain electrical activity during prolonged confinement A subset of the AGARD-STRES battery including memory search, unstable tracking, and a combination of both tasks (dual-task), was applied repeatedly to the four chamber crew members before, during, and after the 60-day isolation period of EXEMSI. Five ground control group members served as a control group. A subjective state questionnaire was also included. The results were subjected to a quantitative single-subject analysis. Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded to permit correlation of changes in task performance with changes in the physiological state. Evaluation of the EEG focused on spectral parameters of spontaneous EEG waves. No physiological data were collected from the control group. Significant decrements in tracking ability were observed in the chamber crew. The time course of these effects followed a triphasic pattern with initial deterioration, intermediate recovery to pre-isolation baseline scores after the first half of the isolation period, and a second deterioration towards the end. None of the control group subjects displayed such an effect. Memory search (speed and accuracy) was only occasionally impaired during isolation, but the control group displayed a similar pattern of changes. It is suggested that a state of decreased alertness causes tracking deterioration, which leads to a reduced efficiency of sustained cue utilization. The assumption of low alertness was further substantiated by higher fatigue ratings by the chamber crew compared to those of the control group. Analysis of the continuous EEG recordings revealed that only two subjects produced reliable alpha wave activity (8-12 Hz) over Pz and, to a much smaller extent, Fz-theta wave activity (5-7 Hz) during task performance. In both subjects Pz-alpha power decreased consistently under task conditions involving single-task and dual-task tracking. Fz-theta activity was increased more by single-task and dual-task memory search than by single-task tracking. The alpha attenuation appears to be associated with an increasing demand on perceptual cue utilization required by the tracking performance. In one subject marked attenuation of alpha power occurred during the first half of the confinement period, where he also scored the highest fatigue ratings. A striking increase in fronto-central theta activity was observed in the same subject after six weeks of isolation. The change was associated with an efficient rather than a degraded task performance, and a high rating of the item ""concentrated"" and a low rating of the item ""fatigued."" This finding supports the hypothesis that the activation state associated with increased fronto-central theta activity accompanies efficient performance of demanding mental tasks. The usefulness of standardized laboratory tasks as monitoring instruments is demonstrated by the direct comparability with results of studies obtained from other relevant research applications using the same tasks. The feasibility of a self-administered integrated psychophysiological assessment of the individual state was illustrated by the nearly complete collection of data. The large number of individual data collected over the entire period permitted application of quantitative single-subject analysis, allowing reliable determination of changes in the individual state in the course of time. It thus appears that this assessment technique can be adapted for in-flight monitoring of astronauts during prolonged spaceflights. Parallel EEG recording can provide relevant supplementary information for diagnosing the individual activation state associated with task performance. The existence of large individual differences in the generation of task-sensitive EEG rhythms forms an important issue for further studies.",Excluded

Sixty-five patients were identified who had received continuous course once-daily 1.8-2 Gy fractions to approximately 60 Gy (range 58-66). All patients received chemotherapy (CHT); 32 received concurrent RT/CHT and 33 sequential CHT and then RT. Prophylactic cranial RT was administered to 17 patients. The time from diagnosis to local failure, tumor progression, and death was assessed using actuarial methods. The median follow-up for all patients was 16.7 months and for surviving patients was 29.6 months. The median age was 64 years (range 36-83), and the median Karnofsky performance status was 80 (range 50-100).RESULTS: The 3-year actuarial rate of local failure, progression-free survival, and overall survival was 40%, 25%, and 23%, respectively. One case of acute Grade 3 esophagitis developed. Ten late complications occurred: four pulmonary, two esophageal, two infectious, one leukemia, and one retinal toxicity with prophylactic cranial RT. Six were mild and resolved with treatment.CONCLUSION: CHT plus approximately 60 Gy of once-daily RT for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer was generally well tolerated. The survival rates were less than have been reported using 45 Gy in 1.5-Gy twice-daily fractions (2-year overall survival rate 47% compared with 30% in this study), but may be comparable because fewer than one-half our patients received concurrent CHT/RT and only 26% received prophylactic cranial RT. The relatively low rate of normal tissue morbidity in our patients supports the use of conventional once-daily fractionation to > or = 60 Gy. A randomized trial would be required to compare the outcomes after maximally tolerated dose twice-daily RT vs. maximally tolerated dose daily RT.",Excluded
3504,"Effects of whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe radiation on contextual freezing and Arc-positive cells in the dentate gyrus The space radiation environment contains high-energy charged particles such as <sup>56</sup>Fe, which could pose a significant hazard to hippocampal function in astronauts during and after the mission(s). The mechanisms underlying impairments in cognition are not clear but might involve alterations in the percentage of neurons in the dentate gyrus expressing the plasticity-related immediate early gene Arc. Previously, we showed effects of cranial <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation on hippocampus-dependent contextual freezing and on the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed, but not free, blade. Because it is unclear whether whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation causes similar effects on these markers of hippocampal function, in the present study we quantified the effects of whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation (600MeV, 0.5 or 1Gy) on hippocampus-dependent and hippocampus-independent cognitive performance and determined whether these effects were associated with changes in Arc expression in the enclosed and free blades of the dentate gyrus. Whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation impacted contextual but not cued fear freezing and the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In mice tested for contextual freezing, there was a correlation between Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In addition, in mice irradiated with 0.5Gy, contextual freezing in the absence of aversive stimuli correlated with the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed blade. In mice tested for cued freezing, there was no correlation between Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In contrast, cued freezing in the presence or absence of aversive stimuli correlated with Arc-positive cells in the free blade. In addition, in mice irradiated with 1Gy cued freezing in the absence of aversive stimuli correlated with the percentage of Arc-positive neurons in the free blade. These data indicate that while whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe radiation affects contextual freezing and Arc-positive cells in the dentate gyrus, the enclosed blade might be more important for contextual freezing while the free blade might be more important for cued freezing. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Included

MRI is limited when patterns of gadolinium uptake are inconclusive. We evaluated the possible contribution of PET with <sup>11</sup>C-methionine PET to MRI in the evaluation of glioma patients after radiotherapy. METHOD(S): 14 patients who had been previously treated with radiotherapy after primary treatment for glioma underwent MRI examinations and <sup>11</sup>C-methionine PET(in less than 15 days) when the differential diagnosis between recurrent tumor and radiation necrosis was needed (9,4+/- 2,3 months). MRI exams were performed first and consisted of gadolinium enhanced images.

Imaging results were confirmed by clinical course and follow-up diagnostic images (7,5+/- 4,8 months). RESULT(S): S17 lesions were evaluated in 14 consecutive patients. MRI images were reported as indeterminate (non-typical gadolinium uptake pattern) in 8 (47,1%). Adding the <sup>11</sup>C-methionine results converted 6 indeterminate studies to determinate (4 recurrent tumor and 2 radiation necrosis).

3171,"Histopathological findings in a surgically resected thalamic cavernous hemangioma 1 year after 40-Gy irradiation Stereotactic radiosurgery is a controversial treatment modality in the management of cerebral cavernous hemangiomas (CHs), and results vary from center to center. Even the interpretation of treatment failure is controversial. It is suggested that the systematic pathological investigation of irradiated specimens could help to resolve the controversy. A hemorrhagic lesion in the posterior part of the thalamus had been diagnosed as a tumor and was treated with 40-Gy fractionated radiotherapy. One year after this treatment the case was reconsidered based on new imaging evidence, and the lesion was removed by conventional craniotomy. Histopathological examination revealed a CH with postirradiation changes. Compared with nonirradiated control CH tissue samples, there was endothelial cell destruction and marked fibrosis with scar tissue formation in the stroma of the treated lesion. The histopathological findings in this specimen were similar to those described in arteriovenous malformations after gamma knife surgery. The results of light microscopic investigations suggest that the ionizing effect of radiation energy evokes vascular and connective tissue stroma changes in CHs as well.",Excluded

Here we report a dual-fluorescent allele, ROSA <sup>nT-nG</sup> , which directs nuclear accumulation of tdTomato in Cre-naive lineages. Cre converts the allele to ROSA <sup>nG</sup> , which drives nuclear EGFP accumulation. Conditions were established for analyzing marked nuclei by flow cytometry on the basis of red-green fluorescence and ploidy, with a particular focus on liver nuclei. Hydrodynamic delivery of a Cre-expression plasmid was used to time-stamp arbitrary hepatocytes for lineage tracing. The distinct green fluorescence of nuclei from Cre-exposed lineages facilitated analyses of ploidy transitions within clones. To assess developmental transitions in liver nuclei, ROSA <sup>nT-nG</sup> was combined with the hepatocyte-specific AlbCre transgene, facilitating discrimination between hepatocyte and nonhepatocyte nuclei. Nuclei extracted from postnatal day 2 (P2) livers were 41 % green and 59 % red and reached a stable level of 84 % green by P22. Until P20, green nuclei were >98 % diploid (2N); at P40 they were ~56 % 2N, 43 % 4N, and <1 % 8N; and by P70 they reached a stable distribution of ~46 % 2N, 45 % 4N, and 9 % 8N. In conclusion, ROSA <sup>nT-nG</sup> will facilitate in vivo and ex vivo studies on liver and will likely be valuable for studies on tissues like muscle, kidney, or brain in which cells are refractory to whole-cell flow cytometry, or like trophectoderm derivatives or cancers in which cells undergo ploidy transitions.",Excluded

Pretreated cells developed resistance to CDDP (resistance factor 2.0) and radiation (survival after 9 Gy 60Co: 36.4% +/- 5.5 versus 28.6% +/- 5.2, p = 0.005).

The dual-phase remineralising toothpaste, Enamelon, also delivered soluble calcium and phosphate ions, essential components of teeth, from separate phases. Both groups had all caries restored at baseline and used a fluoride rinse daily.SUBJECTS: Fifty-seven subjects who received radiation to the head and neck causing saliva hypofunction, entered the study, while 44 completed the 10-12 month visit.MEASUREMENTS: Examinations included coronal and root caries using the Pitts Diagnostic Criteria, salivary flow rate, plaque and gingival indices and microbiological counts over a 1-year period.RESULTS: The average net increment per year for root caries per subject was 0.04 (+/-.052) in subjects completing the study using the remineralising toothpaste and 1.65 (+/-0.51) for root caries in subjects completing the study using the conventional fluoride dentifrice. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.03), suggesting lower net root surface increment/year for the remineralising toothpaste relative to the conventional toothpaste.

3081,"Gamma knife radiosurgery for benign tumors with symptoms from brainstem compression PURPOSE: This study evaluated the role of radiosurgery in the management of symptomatic patients with brainstem compression from benign basal tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Over a 17-year, period 246 patients (202 vestibular schwannomas and 44 meningiomas) with brainstem compression from benign skull-base tumors were managed with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Median tumor volumes were 3.9 cm(3) (range, 0.8-39.0 mL) and 6.6 mL (range, 1.6-25.1 mL) for vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas, respectively. For both tumors, a median marginal dose of 13 Gy was prescribed. Median follow-up of patients was 65 months for vestibular schwannomas and 60 months for meningiomas. Patients were categorized into four groups on the basis of the tumor-brainstem relationship on neuroimaging.RESULTS: Preservation of function was stratified according to grade of brainstem compression. We analyzed the effect of radiosurgery on symptoms of brainstem compression. The tumor control rate was 100 % for meningioma and 97% for vestibular schwannomas (although 5% required an additional procedure such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt). In patients with vestibular schwannoma, serviceable hearing was preserved in 72.0%. Balance improved in 31.9%, remained unchanged in 56.5%, and deteriorated in 11.6% of patients who had imbalance at presentation. Balance improved significantly in patients who had less tumor compression (p = 0.0357) after radiosurgery. Symptoms improved in 43.2% of patients with meningioma.CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is a minimally invasive option for patients with benign basal tumors that indent or distort the brainstem.

However, the toxicity of MRT in central nervous system (CNS) use is still unknown. To gather baseline toxicological data, we evaluated mortality in normal mice following CNS-targeted MRT. Male C57BL/6 J mice were head-fixed in a stereotaxic frame. Synchrotron X-ray-beam radiation was provided by the SPring-8 BL28B2 beam-line. For MRT, radiation was delivered to groups of mice in a 10 x 12 mm unidirectional array consisting of 25-mum-wide beams spaced 100, 200 or 300 mum apart; another group of mice received the equivalent broad-beam radiation therapy (BRT) for comparison. Peak and valley dose rates of the MRT were 120 and 0.7 Gy/s, respectively. Delivered doses were 96-960 Gy for MRT, and 24-120 Gy for BRT. Mortality was monitored for 90 days post-irradiation. Brain tissue was stained using hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate neural structure. Demyelination was evaluated by Kluver-Barrera staining. The LD<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>100</sub> when using MRT were 600 Gy and 720 Gy, respectively, and when using BRT they were 80 Gy and 96 Gy, respectively. In MRT, mortality decreased as the center-to-center beam spacing increased from 100 mum to 300 mum. Cortical architecture was well preserved in MRT, whereas BRT induced various degrees of cerebral hemorrhage and demyelination. MRT was able to deliver extremely high doses of radiation, while still minimizing neuronal death.

3488,"A bayesian adaptive randomized phase ii trial of bevacizumab versus bevacizumab plus vorinostat in adults with recurrent glioblastoma final results BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab improves outcome and reduces symptoms in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). However, GBMs develop adaptive resistance to bevacizumab- mediated angiogenesis inhibition resulting in tumor recurrence. We hypothesized that vorinostat, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, with pleotropic antiangiogenic effects, would delay emergence of resistance to bevacizumab therapy and improve clinical outcome. METHOD(S): In this multicenter phase II trial utilizing a novel Bayesian design, patients with recurrent glioblastoma were adaptively randomized to bevacizumab alone or bevacizumab+vorinostat based on a primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) such that patients had a higher likelihood of receiving the more efficacious treatment. Secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and quality of life assessment (MDASI-BT). Eligible patients were adults (>= 18 yrs) with histologically confirmed GBMs recurrent after prior radiation and temozolomide therapy, adequate organ function, KPS>= 60, and no prior bevacizumab/HDAC inhibitors. RESULT(S): Ninety patients (bevacizumab+vorinostat:49, bevacizumab:41) were enrolled and 74 were evaluable for PFS (bevacizumab+vorinostat:44, bevacizumab:30). Grade 3 or greater toxicities in 85 evaluable patients included hypertension (n=37), neurological changes (n=2), anorexia (n=2), infections (n=9), wound dehiscence (n=2), DVT/PE (n=2), and colonic perforation (n=1). There was one treatment-related death due to pulmonary embolism. Upon multivariate analysis for bevacizumab+vorinostat vs bevacizumab, median PFS (3.7 vs. 3.9 months, p=0.94, HR 0.63 [95% CI 0.38, 1.06, p=0.08]) or median OS (7.8 vs. 9.3 months, p=0.64, HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.5, 1.6, p=0.79]) were not significantly different between the two arms. Ongoing analyses of patient reported outcomes (MDASI-BT) and plasma biomarkers will be reported. CONCLUSION(S): Combining bevacizumab with vorinostat did not result in improved PFS or OS compared with bevacizumab alone in patients with recurrent GBM.

The FDG avid sites were tabulated as the primary site, lower extremity, brain, and other sites. The hypothesis is that routine skull base to mid-thigh versus whole-body <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT in patients with malignant melanoma will not change management.Results: Patients (26) were divided into those with primary melanoma site in either the lower extremities (six patients) or other site (20 patients). Four of the six patients with the primary site in the lower extremities also had positive findings in the ipsilateral inguinal lymph nodes. One of the patients with a positive inguinal lymph node had metastatic sites in the external iliac region and lungs on the initial study. On follow-up imaging, this patient also exhibited diffuse metastatic disease, including a lower extremity. None of the remaining patients in this group had positive findings other than the primary site in the lower extremity. Of the remaining 20 patients with the primary site not in the lower extremity, one had diffuse metastatic disease that included a lower extremity. However, lower extremity involvement would not change patient management in this case. A second patient in this group had diffuse metastatic disease that also involved the brain. However, no metastatic disease was present in the lower extremities in this patient. None of the remaining 18 patients in this group had metastatic disease in a lower extremity. Two patients in the entire study group of 26 had brain metastasis on contrast-enhanced head CT, with one having multiple brain metastasis. PET failed to demonstrate some of the brain lesions. In the other patient with solitary brain metastasis detected on contrast-enhanced head CT, PET was negative.Conclusion: <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT imaging of the lower extremity may not be justified if the primary neoplasm is not located in the lower extremities. Elimination of lower extremity imaging will reduce scanning time and additional radiation exposure. Similarly, PET/CT imaging of the brain may not be justified if contrast-enhanced CT or magnetic resonance imaging of the head is already obtained since these are more sensitive.",Excluded
3348,"The Impact of body-only proton radiation on immune-CNS communication Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is an established treatment for many hematological disorders including lymphomas and leukemias. Although the prognosis after HSCT has historically been poor, associated with high mortality rates, advances in treatment have led to increases in long-term survival and, consequently, an increased risk for neuropsychological dysfunction. Roughly 40% of all allogeneic HSCTs performed in 2006-2010 involved total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning. Previously, we reported that many TBI-induced changes in splenic phagocytic populations were mitigated by chlorisondamine (CHL), a non-selective nicotinic blocker that crosses the blood-brain barrier. In this study, we characterized the effects of body-only proton irradiation (excluding brain) and CHL on the response to a bacterial challenge in 8- to 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice. Mice were given CHL (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and irradiated (0 or 3 Gy) 60-90 min later. Ten days post-irradiation, mice were inoculated with 5e7 CFU of Escherichia coli (i.p.) and euthanized 90-120 min later. We characterized blood and splenic leukocyte population distributions (flow cytometry and hematology), cytokine levels (multiplexed cytokine analysis) and oxidative burst capacity. Radiation decreased virtually all splenic leukocyte counts while increasing oxidative burst capacity. In the blood, radiation decreased lymphocytes but increased innate subsets. Sympathetic blockade did not counter most of these radiation effects. This suggests that the disruptive effect of TBI on brain-immune communication is dependent on direct exposure to the brain.",Included

Of these, 143 underwent LD-CT with IR and 117 underwent ULD-CT with IR. The patients were divided according to their body mass index (BMI) into BMI1 (<22.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), BMI2 (23.0-24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and BMI3 (>=25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) groups. Two blinded radiologists independently evaluated the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), qualitative image quality, and final diagnoses (lumbar disc disease and facet joint osteoarthritis). L-spine MRIs interpreted by consensus were used as the reference standard. All data were statistically analyzed.RESULTS: ULD protocol showed significantly lower SNR for all patients (p < 0.001) except the vertebral bodies and lower qualitative image quality for BMI3 patients (p <= 0.033). There was no statistically significant difference between ULD (sensitivity, 95.1-98.1%; specificity, 92.5-98.7%; accuracy, 94.6-98.0%) and LD protocols (sensitivity, 95.6-100%; specificity, 95.5-98.9%; accuracy, 97.4-98.1%), (all p>=0.1) in the BMI1 and BMI2; while dose was 60-68% lower with the ULD protocol. Interobserver agreements were excellent or good with regard to image quality and final diagnoses.CONCLUSIONS: For the BM1 and BMI2 groups, ULD-CT provided an acceptable image quality and exhibited a diagnostic accuracy similar to that of LD-CT. These findings suggest that it is a useful diagnostic tool for patients with chronic LBP who exhibit a BMI of <25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.",Excluded

Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, and logistic regression were used for analysis of survival and associated factors.RESULTS: At the time of GKS, the median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score was 70 (range 50-90), and the mean BCM-20 score was 45.5 +/- 6.1. The mean tumor volume (+/- standard deviation) was 5.2 +/- 4.6 cm(3) with corresponding T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR volumes of 59.25 +/- 37.3 and 62.1 +/- 38.8 cm(3), respectively (R(2) = 0.977, p < 0.001). The mean edema index (volume of peritumoral edema/tumor volume) was 17.5 +/- 14.5. The mean peripheral and maximum GKS doses were 17.4 +/- 2.3 and 35 +/- 4.7 Gy, respectively. The median survival was 11 months. The longer survival was related to KPS scores >or= 70 (p = 0.008), age < 65 years (p = 0.022), and a reduction of > 6 in BCM-20 score (p = 0.007), but survival was not related to preexisting edema or tumor volume. A reduction in BCM-20 score of > 6 was related to decreased volume in T1-weighted and FLAIR imaging (p < 0.001). Thirty-eight (79.2%) of 48 patients demonstrated decreased tumor volume and accompanied by decreased T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR volume. Eight (16.7%) of the 48 patients exhibited increased or stable tumor volume. A margin dose > 18 Gy was more likely to afford tumor reduction and resolution of peritumoral edema (p = 0.005 and p = 0.006, respectively). However, prior external-beam radiation therapy correlated with worsened preexisting peritumoral edema (p = 0.013) and longer maintenance of corticosteroids (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Patients demonstrating a reduction in the BCM-20 score > 6, age < 65 years, and KPS score >or= 70 exhibited longer survival. Significant preexisting edema did not influence the tumor response or clinical outcome. The resolution of edema was related to better quality of life but not to longer survival.",Excluded
2436,"Carotid artery revascularization through a radiated field OBJECTIVE: Extracranial carotid stenosis is a complication of external head and neck irradiation. The safety and durability of carotid artery revascularization through a radiated field has been debated. We describe the immediate and long-term results in a series of 27 consecutive patients who received treatment over 12 years.METHODS: From May 1990 to May 2002, 27 consecutive patients underwent 30 primary carotid artery revascularization procedures. All patients had received previous radiation therapy within a mean interval of 10 years (range, 1-26 years), with average radiation dose of 62 Gy (range, 50-70 Gy). Moderate to severe scarring of the skin or radiation fibrosis was present in three fourths of patients. Thirteen patients (48%) had undergone radical neck dissection, and 2 patients had a permanent tracheotomy. The indications for carotid surgery included high-grade (>70%) symptomatic stenosis in 18 patients (60%) and high-grade asymptomatic stenosis in 12 patients (40%). General anesthesia with systematic shunting was used in 18 patients (60%), and regional anesthesia with selective shunting was used in 12 patients (40%). Operations included standard carotid endarterectomy (n = 20), with patch angioplasty (n = 12) or direct closure (n = 8); carotid interposition bypass grafting (n = 7); and subclavian to carotid bypass grafting (n = 3). Primary closure of the surgical wound was performed in all procedures without any special muscular or skin flaps. All patients were followed up for a mean of 40 months (range, 3-99 months).RESULTS: There was one (3.3%) perioperative death, from massive intracerebral hemorrhage; and 1 patient had a transient ischemic attack. In-hospital complications included neck hematoma in 2 patients, which required surgical drainage in 1 patient. There was neither delayed wound healing nor infection. Twelve patients died during follow-up, of causes not related to treatment. None of the surviving patients had further stroke, and all remained asymptomatic. Follow-up duplex scans showed asymptomatic recurrent stenosis greater than 60% in 3 patients, 2 of whom with stenosis greater than 80% underwent repeat operation. Risk for recurrent stenosis greater than 60% at 18 months was 16.6%. Recurrent stenosis occurred in 2 of these patients after saphenous vein bypass, and in 1 patient after endarterectomy with vein patch angioplasty.CONCLUSION: The clinical results and sustained freedom from symptoms and stroke over 40-month follow-up suggests that carotid revascularization through a radiated field is a safe and durable procedure in patients at high surgical risk, despite a marked incidence of recurrent stenosis.",Excluded
3331,"Effects of <sup>60</sup>Co gamma radiation on the hepatic and cerebral levels of some prostaglandins In two groups of rats irradiated with <sup>60</sup>Co gamma rays (500 and 750 rad, respectively) the changes in the hepatic and cerebral contents of prostaglandin E<inf>1</inf> and prostaglandin F2alpha were investigated, at constant intervals, up to 18 days after irradiation. Hepatic and cerebral prostaglandins E<inf>1</inf> were found to be similarly increased during the whole postirradiation period in both 500 rad irradiated rats and 750 rad irradiated rats. Conversely, these rays were found to have no significant effect on the hepatic prostaglandin F2alpha and to induce, depending on the radiation dose, a reversible or an irreversible decrease in the content of cerebral prostaglandin F2alpha. These results are believed to provide some evidence for a schematic formulation of a mechanism of the radiation induced latent circulatory insufficiency and to elucidate some aspects of the functional interrelations between these prostaglandins, catecholamines, acetylcholine and cyclic AMP after gamma irradiation.",Included

This study aimed to evaluate the changes after stereotactic radiosurgery for AVMs.METHODS: Nineteen cases with cerebral AVMs had failure after stereotactic radiosurgery therapy. The symptoms and angiography were assessed. All patients underwent microsurgery. Pathologic examination was performed for all cases and electron microscopic examination was carried out in 6 patients.RESULTS: Seven cases had hemorrhage from 12 to 98 months after stereotactic radiosurgery, 5 had headache, 4 had refractory encephalon edema, 2 had epilepsy as a new symptom and 1 had a pressure cyst 5 years after radiosurgery. Angiography in 18 cases, 8 - 98 months after radiation therapy, demonstrated no significant changes in 5 cases, slight reduction in 9, near complete obliteration in 1 and complete obliteration in 3. An abnormal vessel was found on pathologic examination in 17 cases, even one case had obliterated in angiography. Electron microscopy examination showed vessel wall weakness, but the vessels remained open and blood circulated. One case died because of a moribund state before surgery. The other 18 cases had no new neurological deficiencies, seizure control and no hemorrhage occurred after microsurgery at an average follow-up of 3 years.CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiotherapy for AVMs should have a long period follow-up. If serious complications occur, microsurgery can be performed as salvage treatment.",Excluded
3229,"The human CSB (ERCC6) gene corrects the transcription-coupled repair defect in the CHO cell mutant UV61 The human CSB gene, mutated in Cockayne's syndrome group B (partially defective in both repair and transcription) was previously cloned by virtue of its ability to correct the moderate UV sensitivity of the CHO mutant UV61. To determine whether the defect in UV61 is the hamster equivalent of Cockayne's syndrome, the RNA polymerase II transcription and DNA repair characteristics of a repair-proficient CHO cell line (AA8), UV61 and a CSB transfectant of UV61 were compared. In each cell line, formation and removal of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) were measured in the individual strands of the actively transcribed DHFR gene and in a transcriptionally inactive region downstream of DHFR. AA8 cells efficiently remove CPDs from the transcribed strand, but not from either the non-transcribed strand or the inactive region. There was no detectable repair of CPDs in any region of the genome in UV61. Transfection of the human CSB gene into UV61 restores the normal repair pattern (CPD removal in only the transcribed strand), demonstrating that the DNA repair defect in UV61 is homologous to that in Cockayne's syndrome (complementation group B) cells. However, we observe no significant deficiency in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription in UV61, suggesting that the CSB protein has independent roles in DNA repair and RNA transcription pathways.",Excluded
2915,"Activation of ATM and phosphorylation of p53 by heat shock p53 protein is phosphorylated in response to various stresses. Here we examined phosphorylation of p53 protein in normal human diploid cells after heat shock at 43 degrees C for 2 h. We found that heat shock stimulates phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 but not at Ser20, while X-irradiation at 4 Gy and 10 J/m(2) of UV induces phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and less significantly at Ser20. Increased phosphorylation of Ser15 was also observed in heat shocked GM638, the SV40-transformed human fibroblast cell line. Although X-ray irradiation induced phosphorylation of Ser6, 9, 20, and 37 in GM638 cells, heat shock did not affect the phosphorylation level of these serines. We observed little or no phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 in two primary ataxia telangiectasia fibroblast cells, that are defective in ATM. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we confirmed that immunoprecipitated ATM from both heat-shocked and X-irradiated normal human diploid cells can phosphorylate p53 at Ser15 to a similar extent. These results indicate that heat shock induces phosphorylation of p53, especially at Ser15, and its phosphorylation is mediated by ATM kinase.",Excluded

Spaceflight decreased the expression of crucial genes involved in DA synthesis and degradation, as well as the D1 receptor. However, spaceflight failed to alter the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase-2, 5-HT transporter, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT3 receptor genes, though it reduced 5-HT2A receptor gene expression in the hypothalamus. We revealed risk DA and 5-HT neurogenes for long-term spaceflight for the first time, as well as microgravity-responsive genes (tyrosine hydroxylase, catechol-O-methyltransferase, and D1 receptor in the nigrostriatal system; D1 and 5-HT2A receptors in the hypothalamus; and monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) in the frontal cortex).

2512,"LINAC radiosurgery for glomus jugulare tumors: retrospective - cohort study of 23 patients Background: Glomus jugulare tumors (GJTs) are uncommon and locally disruptive tumors that usually arise within the jugular foramen of the temporal bone. Surgery was the treatment of choice up until recently. In the last decades, however, radiosurgery has surfaced as a promising alternative treatment by providing excellent tumor control with low risk of cranial nerve injuries. Our aim was to examine the results of radiosurgery specifically, linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery (LINAC SRS) for GJT treatment. We hypothesized that radiosurgery will reduce the size of the tumor and improve neurological symptoms. Design and method: Between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 2013, 30 patients with GJTs were treated in Sheba Medical Center using LINAC SRS treatment. Comprehensive clinical follow-up was available for 23 patients. Sixteen patients were female and seven males with a median age of 64 years, with a range of 18-87 years. In 19 of the patients, LINAC SRS was the primary treatment, whereas in the remaining four cases, surgery or embolization preceded radiosurgery. The median treated dose to tumor margin was 14 Gy (range 12-27 Gy), and the median tumor volume before treatment was 5 ml (range 0.5-15 ml). Result(s): Following the LINAC SRS treatment, 14 of 23 patients (60%) showed improvement of previous neurological deficits, nine patients (40%) remained unchanged. At the end of a follow-up, tumor reduction was seen in 13 patients and a stable volume in eight (91% tumor control rate). Two cases of tumor progression were noted. Three patients (13%) had post- SRS complications during the follow-up, two of which achieved tumor control, while in one the tumor advanced. Conclusion(s): LINAC SRS is a practical treatment option for GJTs, with a high rate of tumor control and satisfactory neurological improvement.

3286,"Acute vision loss: A potential novel indication for intraarterial chemotherapy in the treatment of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (case report) Congress Abstract Introduction: The combination of radiotherapy and concomitant intraarterial cisplatin (RADPLAT) is well recognized in controlling locally invasive unresectable sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC). However, no reliable data are available for acute administration of intraarterial chemotherapy alone for palliation of acute vision loss in patients with unresectable SNUC involving the optic nerve. Objective(s): To suggest a novel indication for compassionate use of intraarterial chemotherapy alone in the acute setting in patients with advanced SNUC associated vision loss. Case Presentation: A 25-year-old Hispanic man presented with bloody nasal discharge, left proptosis, and decreased visual acuity in the left eye. Both CT and MRI of the head and neck revealed a large 6.2-cm sinonasal mass extending through the cribriform plate to the dural, left maxillary sinus, and left orbit resulting proptosis with involvement of the optic nerve. The patient was not a surgical candidate due to intracranial extension with dural involvement. The patient's visual acuity in the left eye was 2400/20 on presentation. The patient underwent biopsy, which revealed SNUC. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning requires approximately 1 week to orchestrate at our institution. We decided to administer supratherapeutic intraarterial cisplatin acutely, along with thiosulfate infusion without radiation in an attempt to save the patient's vision. The patient experienced an increase in pain initially. However, over the following 5 days, the degree of proptosis diminished markedly and vision improved substantially without IMRT. The patient's follow-up vision testing revealed 30/20 vision in the left eye at 1 week and 20/20 vision at 2 weeks following therapy. Subsequent MRI revealed marked necrosis and decrease in size of the mass. Conclusion(s): Although we are not specifically advocating intraarterial administration of chemotherapy alone for the treatment of head and neck tumors, it may be effective in the acute setting for palliation of acute vision loss related to compression by head and neck tumors such as SNUC.",Excluded
3231,"Neuronal activity in vivo enhances functional myelin repair In demyelinating diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), demyelination of neuronal fibers impairs impulse conduction and causes axon degeneration. While neuronal activity stimulates oligodendrocyte production and myelination in normal conditions, it remains unclear whether the activity of demyelinated axons restores their loss-of-function in a harmful environment. To investigate this question, we established a model to induce a moderate optogenetic stimulation of demyelinated axons in the corpus callosum at the level of the motor cortex in which cortical circuit activation and locomotor effects were reduced in adult freely moving mice. We demonstrate that a moderate activation of demyelinated axons enhances the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells onto mature oligodendrocytes, but only under a repeated stimulation paradigm. This activity-dependent increase in the oligodendrocyte pool promotes an extensive remyelination and functional restoration of conduction, as revealed by ultrastructural analyses and compound action potential recordings. Our findings reveal the need of preserving an appropriate neuronal activity in the damaged tissue to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination, likely by enhancing axon-oligodendroglia interactions. Our results provide new perspectives for translational research using neuromodulation in demyelinating diseases.",Excluded
2984,"Using synthetic CT for partial brain radiation therapy: Impact on image guidance PURPOSE: Recent advancements in synthetic computed tomography (synCT) from magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data have made MRI-only treatment planning feasible in the brain, although synCT performance for image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is not well understood. This work compares geometric equivalence of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from CTs and synCTs for brain cancer patients and quantifies performance for partial brain IGRT.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten brain cancer patients (12 lesions, 7 postsurgical) underwent MR-SIM and CT-SIM. SynCTs were generated by combining ultra-short echo time, T1, T2, and fluid attenuation inversion recovery datasets using voxel-based weighted summation. SynCT and CT DRRs were compared using patient-specific thresholding and assessed via overlap index, Dice similarity coefficient, and Jaccard index. Planar IGRT images for 22 fractions were evaluated to quantify differences between CT-generated DRRs and synCT-generated DRRs in 6 quadrants. Previously validated software was implemented to perform 2-dimensional (2D)-2D rigid registrations using normalized mutual information. Absolute (planar image/DRR registration) and relative (differences between synCT and CT DRR registrations) shifts were calculated for each axis and 3-dimensional vector difference. A total of 1490 rigid registrations were assessed.RESULTS: DRR agreements in anteroposterior and lateral views for overlap index, Dice similarity coefficient, and Jaccard index were >0.95. Normalized mutual information results were equivalent in 75% of quadrants. Rotational registration results were negligible (<0.07degree). Statistically significant differences between CT and synCT registrations were observed in 9/18 matched quadrants/axes (P < .05). The population average absolute shifts were 0.77 +/- 0.58 and 0.76 +/- 0.59 mm for CT and synCT, respectively, for all axes/quadrants. Three-dimensional vectors were <2 mm in 77.7 +/- 10.8% and 76.5 +/- 7.2% of CT and synCT registrations, respectively. SynCT DRRs were sensitive in postsurgical cases (vector displacements >2 mm in affected quadrants).CONCLUSIONS: DRR synCT geometry was robust. Although statistically significant differences were observed between CT and synCT registrations, results were not clinically significant. Future work will address synCT generation in postsurgical settings.",Excluded

The original transfection frequency, as measured by transformed foci, was markedly reduced in two A-T strains when compared with either normal or xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts. As with SV40 virion-transformed fibroblasts, pSV ori--transformed cells entered a crisis phase, from which about one-fourth of the original clones from A-T and normal fibroblasts recovered. Both the pSV ori--transformed TAT2SF cell line and an SV40 virion-transformed AT5BI (GM5489) cell line retained their characteristic sensitivity to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation, as well as their X ray-resistant DNA synthesis. Southern blot analysis of cellular SV40 sequences demonstrated a single major integration site of pSV ori- in the AT2SF cells. In contrast, AT5BI cells transformed with SV40 virions demonstrated a high degree of heterogeneity of integrated viral sequences.

Associations between clinical factors, PI3K mutations status, and local failure (LF) were evaluated with univariate and multivariate competing risks regression.RESULTS: A total of 112 patients received whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) to a median dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions, and 147 patients received stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to 338 lesions; 276 lesions were treated with single fraction SRS (median dose 21 Gy) and 76 lesions over 3 to 5 fractions SRS (median dose 30 Gy). PI3K mutations were present in 36 WBRT patients (32%) and 44 SRS patients (30%). For WBRT, patients with PI3K mutations (hazard ratio 2.67, P < .001) were found to be at higher risk for LF on multivariable analysis, and the 1-year cumulative incidence of LF was 50% (95% confidence interval [CI] 32%-65%) for patients with PI3K mutations versus 26% (95% CI 17%-37%) for patients without PI3K mutations. For SRS lesions, while PI3K mutations positivity was not statistically significantly associated with LF, higher rate of LF was observed: 1-year LF cumulative incidence of 11% (95% CI 6%-17%) for patients with PI3K mutations versus 5% (95% CI 3%-9%) for patients without PI3K mutations.CONCLUSION: Patients with PI3K mutations are at higher risk for LF for brain metastases after RT.

3528,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for medically refractory multiple sclerosis-related tremor OBJECTIVE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease that can lead to severe intention tremor in some patients. In several case reports, conventional radiotherapy has been reported to possibly exacerbate MS. Radiosurgery dramatically limits normal tissue irradiation to potentially avoid such a problem. Gamma Knife thalamotomy (GKT) has been established as a minimally invasive technique that is effective in treating essential tremor and Parkinson's disease-related tremor. The goal in this study was to analyze the outcomes of GKT in patients suffering from medically refractory MS-related tremor. METHODS The authors retrospectively studied the outcomes of 15 patients (mean age 46.5 years) who had undergone GKT over a 15-year period (1998-2012). Fourteen patients underwent GKT at a median maximum dose of 140 Gy (range 130-150 Gy) using a single 4-mm isocenter. One patient underwent GKT at a dose of 140 Gy delivered via two 4-mm isocenters (3 mm apart). The posteroinferior region of the nucleus ventralis intermedius (VIM) was the target for all GKTs. The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale was used to evaluate tremor, handwriting, drawing, and drinking. The median time to the last follow-up was 39 months. RESULTS After GKT, 13 patients experienced tremor improvement on the side contralateral to surgery. Four patients noted tremor arrest at a median of 4.5 months post-GKT. Seven patients had excellent tremor improvement and 6 had good tremor improvement. Four patients noted excellent functional improvement, 8 noted good functional improvement, and 1 noted satisfactory functional improvement. Three patients experienced diminished tremor relief at a median of 18 months after radiosurgery. Two patients experienced temporary adverse radiation effects. Another patient developed a large thalamic cyst 60 months after GKT, which was successfully managed with Ommaya reservoir placement. CONCLUSIONS Gamma Knife thalamotomy was found to be a minimally invasive and beneficial procedure for medically refractory MS tremor.",Excluded
2774,"Radiotherapy management of brain metastases using conventional linear accelerator BACKGROUND AND AIMS: As treatments for primary cancers continue to improve life expectancy, unfortunately, brain metastases also appear to be constantly increasing and life expectancy for patients with brain metastases is low. Longer survival and improved quality of life may be achieved using localised radiological and surgical approaches in addition to low dose corticosteroids. Stereotactic brain radiotherapy is one rapidly evolving localized radiation treatment. This article describes our experience with stereotactic radiotherapy using a linear accelerator.METHODS: We reviewed patients treated with stereotactic radiotherapy, from the time of its introduction into daily practice in our Department of Oncology in 2014. We collected the data on patient treatment and predicted survival based on prognostic indices and actual patient outcome.RESULTS: A total of 10 patients were treated by stereotactic radiotherapy, in one case in combination with whole brain radiotherapy and hippocampal sparing. There was no significant treatment related toxicity during the treatment or follow-up and due to the small number of fractions, the overall tolerance of the treatment was excellent. The patient intrafractional movement in all cases was under 1 mm suggesting that 1 mm margin around the CTV to create the PTV is sufficient and also that patient immobilization using the thermoplastic mask compared with invasive techniques, is feasible. We also found that prognostic indices such as the Graded Prognostic Assessment provide accurate predictions of patient survival.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our current evidence, patients with brain metastases fit enough, should be considered for stereotactic radiotherapy treatment.",Excluded
3589,"Cellular response of meningioma towards retinoid acid and ionizing radiation Meningiomas are the second most common primary brain tumors and represent one-third of all primary neoplasms of the central nervous system. Currently, most meninigiomas are effectively managed via surgical resection. Recurrent meningiomas and unresectable, residual tumors after partial resection are treated with radiation. However, patients who are not suitable for surgery or radiation therapy or whose tumors recur after such treatment have limited therapeutic options. Retinoids are a class of compounds structurally related to vitamin A. Retinoic acid (RA) has been widely used to treat dermatological disease. Recently, RA, the active derivative of vitamin A and the first candidate diffusible morphogen in vertebrates, was used as a potential chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agent. In this study, we sought to determine the effects of RA on meningiomas when administered in combinination with ionizing radiation. The early data showed that both all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 13-cis-retinoic aciecan inhibited cell proliferation at high concentrations (10 mM) but had little cell proliferation inhibition activity at low concentrations (10 nM and 1 mM, respectively), thereby implicating the role of RA in meningioma clinical treatment. Neither ATRA nor 13-cis-RA influenced cell cycle progression. Further study showed that 10-mM ATRA exposure led to increased cell death after irradiation; however, 10-nM or 1-mMATRA pretreatment enhanced meningioma cell survival following irradiation. Comet assay showed that RA reduced the G2/M phase arrest caused by irradiation, thereby suggesting that DNA repair processes are involved in the activity of RA when combined with radiation.",Excluded

The present study compared the effects of gamma irradiation on the expression of interneuron markers within the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region with expression in control matched rats. This area was chosen for study because of its well-characterized circuitry. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 60 Gy of whole brain gamma radiation and after 24 or 48 hours, the brains were removed, fixed and sectioned to quantitate expression of parvalbumin (PV), calbindin-D28K (CB), reelin, neuropeptide-Y (NPY), and somatostatin. All of these markers increased in expression over the first 48 hours, except NPY, which decreased. This provides novel information on changes in gene expression in the hippocampal interneurons following radiation. Staining for Beclin 1, a marker of autophagy, increased most strongly in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG). Overall, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased intracellular calcium follows irradiation, leading to an increased expression of calcium binding proteins. Increased autophagy occurs in the neurogenic zone of the dentate hilus, consistent with reduced effective neurogenesis after irradiation.",Included

Complete and partial response in both groups was comparable, and the overall survival was comparable. However, relapse-free survival was significantly higher in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy and irradiation in comparison with the radiotherapy alone group. Disease-free survival was higher in the concomitant chemotherapy-radiotherapy patients, although survival was not significantly modified, probably because of suboptimal chemotherapy. The initial intrathoracic failure rate was 40.7% inthe concomitant chemotherapy-irradiation group, compared with 53.8% in the radiotherapy-alone patients. None of the patients receiving delayed chemotherapy following the radiotherapy recurrence showed significant tumor response to the drugs. The incidence of distant metastasis was slightly lower in the chemotherapy groups. Brain metastases were noted in 7% of the patients in both groups. Increased intrathoracic recurrences were noted in patients with lower doses of irradiation. Nine of 13 patients treated with inadequate portals developed intrathoracic recurrences in comparison to 13 of 40 treated with adequate irradiation fields.

Hippocampal regions were obtained from brains of 21-day-old rats that were exposed for 90 days to 50Hz magnetic fields at 50 and 100 microT intensities. In comparison to controls, ELF exposure caused increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels concomitant with increased activities of Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase C (PKC), cAMP-dependent protein kinase and calcineurin as well as decreased activity of Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in hippocampal regions. Simultaneous ligand-binding studies revealed decreased binding to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors.

2956,"Differential expression of Homer1a in the hippocampus and cortex likely plays a role in radiation-induced brain injury Fractionated partial or whole-brain irradiation is the primary treatment for metastatic brain tumors. Despite reducing tumor burden and increasing lifespan, progressive, irreversible cognitive impairment occurs in >50% of the patients who survive >6 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. The exact mechanism(s) responsible for this radiation-induced brain injury are unknown; however, preclinical studies suggest that radiation modulates the extracellular receptor kinase signaling pathway, which is associated with cognitive impairment in many neurological diseases. In the study reported here, we demonstrated that the extracellular receptor kinase transcriptionally-regulated early response gene, Homer1a, was up-regulated transiently in the hippocampus and down-regulated in the cortex of young adult male Fischer 344 X Brown Norway rats at 48 h after 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation. Two months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation, these changes in Homer1a expression correlated with a down-regulation of the hippocampal glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma, and an up-regulation of cortical glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma. Two drugs that prevent radiation-induced cognitive impairment in rats, the angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker, L-158,809, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, reversed the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced Homer1a expression at 48 h in the hippocampus and cortex and restored glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma to the levels in sham-irradiated controls at 2 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. These data indicate that Homer1a is, (1) a brain region specific regulator of radiation-induced brain injury, including cognitive impairment and (2) potentially a druggable target for preventing it.",Included
2762,"Prediction of an oxygen extraction fraction map by convolutional neural network: validation of input data among MR and PET images PURPOSE: Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) is a biomarker for the viability of brain tissue in ischemic stroke. However, acquisition of the OEF map using positron emission tomography (PET) with oxygen-15 gas is uncomfortable for patients because of the long fixation time, invasive arterial sampling, and radiation exposure. We aimed to predict the OEF map from magnetic resonance (MR) and PET images using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and to demonstrate which PET and MR images are optimal as inputs for the prediction of OEF maps.METHODS: Cerebral blood flow at rest (CBF) and during stress (sCBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps acquired from oxygen-15 PET, and routine MR images (T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted images) for 113 patients with steno-occlusive disease were learned with U-Net. MR and PET images acquired from the other 25 patients were used as test data. We compared the predicted OEF maps and intraclass correlation (ICC) with the real OEF values among combinations of MRI, CBF, CBV, and sCBF.RESULTS: Among the combinations of input images, OEF maps predicted by the model learned with MRI, CBF, CBV, and sCBF maps were the most similar to the real OEF maps (ICC: 0.597 +/- 0.082). However, the contrast of predicted OEF maps was lower than that of real OEF maps.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the deep CNN learned useful features from CBF, sCBF, CBV, and MR images and predict qualitatively realistic OEF maps. These findings suggest that the deep CNN model can shorten the fixation time for <sup>15</sup>O PET by skipping <sup>15</sup>O<sub>2</sub> scans. Further training with a larger data set is required to predict accurate OEF maps quantitatively.",Excluded
2401,"Antiangiogenic agent, thalidomide increases the antitumor effect of single high dose irradiation (gamma knife radiosurgery) in the rat orthotopic glioma model Gliomas are primary brain tumors associated with a poor prognosis partly due to resistance to conventional therapies. To overcome this problem, we investigated the combined effects of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) and an antiangiogenic agent, thalidomide (THD), or a chemotherapeutic agent, temozolomide (TMZ), on a rat glioma model. GKS (20 Gy single dose) alone and/or drugs (for 3 days) were delivered 14 or 18 days after stereotactic implantation of C6/LacZ glioma cells into the brains of Sprague-Dawley rats. A group of animals treated with or without drugs for 3 days was irradiated on day 18 and sacrificed at 24 h after GKS to evaluate cell proliferation, apoptosis and microvessel density. The other group of animals was irradiated on day 14 and sacrificed at day 5 after GKS for the measurement of tumor volume. Apoptosis of endothelial cells in the tumor beds was only observed in the early period after GKS. Decreased cell proliferation and increased tumor cell apoptosis were observed in rat gliomas treated with GKS and THD or TMZ. The combination treatments with GKS and THD or GKS and TMZ also decreased microvessel density, i.e. angiogenesis, more effectively compared with GKS treatment alone. The combination of GKS and THD was the most effective regimen, resulting in a significant decrease of tumor volume. We suggest that the antitumor effect of GKS on glioma is enhanced by the addition of THD. Therefore, combined therapy with GKS and THD might be a favorable treatment for gliomas.",Excluded

2584,"Field dependence study of in vivo brain (31) P MRS up to 16.4 T In vivo (31) P MRS provides a unique tool for studying bioenergetics of living organs. Although its utility has been limited by the relatively low (31) P NMR sensitivity, increasing magnetic field strength (B0 ) could significantly improve the quality and reliability of the (31) P MR spectra for biomedical research. To quantitatively understand the field dependence of in vivo (31) P MRS for brain applications, (31) P NMR sensitivity of phosphocreatine (PCr) in rat brains was measured and compared at 9.4 T and 16.4 T. Additionally, the linewidths and T1 relaxation times of PCr and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) resonances obtained from human and animal brains over a wide B0 range from 4 T, 7 T, and 9.4 T to 16.4 T were examined and their field dependences were quantified. The results indicate an approximate 1.74-fold (31) P signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain for PCr at 16.4 T compared with 9.4 T. An approximate power 1.4 dependence of (31) P SNR on B0 was concluded. Substantial improvements in spectral resolution and significantly shortened T1 values of brain PCr and ATP were observed at high/ultrahigh fields, contributing to an additional sensitivity gain and spectral improvement. In summary, the overall findings from this study suggest that in vivo (31) P MRS should greatly benefit from high/ultrahigh fields for noninvasive assessment of altered bioenergetics and metabolic processes associated with brain function and neurological diseases.",Excluded
2828,"Structural analysis of the alpha N-terminal region of erythroid and nonerythroid spectrins by small-angle X-ray scattering We used SpalphaI-1-156 peptide, a well-characterized model peptide of the alphaN-terminal region of erythrocyte spectrin, and SpalphaII-1-149, an alphaII brain spectrin model peptide similar in sequence to SpalphaI-1-156, to study their association affinities with a betaI-spectrin peptide, SpbetaI-1898-2083, by isothermal titration calorimetry. We also determined their conformational flexibilities in solution by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) methods. These two peptides exhibit sequence homology and could be expected to exhibit similar association affinities with beta-spectrin. However, our studies show that the affinity of SpalphaII-1-149 with SpbetaI-1898-2083 is much higher than that of SpalphaI-1-156. Our SAXS findings also indicate a significantly more extended conformation for SpalphaII-1-149 than for SpalphaI-1-156. The radius of gyration values obtained by two different analyses of SAXS data and by molecular modeling all show a value of about 25 A for SpalphaI-1-156 and of about 30 A for SpalphaII-1-149, despite the fact that SpalphaI-1-156 has seven amino acid residues more than SpalphaII-1-149. For SpalphaI-1-156, the SAXS results are consistent with a flexible junction between helix C' and the triple helical bundle that allows multiple orientations between these two structural elements, in good agreement with our published NMR analysis. The SAXS findings for SpalphaII-1-149 support the hypothesis that this junction region is rigid (and probably helical) for alphaII brain spectrin. The nature of the junction region, from one extreme as a random coil (conformationally mobile) segment in alphaI to another extreme as a rigid segment in alphaII, determines the orientation of helix C' relative to the first structural domain. We suggest that this particular junction region in alpha-spectrin plays a major role in modulating its association affinity with beta-spectrins, and thus regulates spectrin tetramer levels. We also note that these are the first conformational studies of brain spectrin.",Excluded

Measuring local cerebral blood flow and histopathological studies] BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to investigate late effects following stereotactic single fraction and small volume irradiation on cerebral blood flow and histologic alterations in the rat brain parenchyma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 66 Copenhagen rats, separated into eleven groups of six animals each received single doses of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 Gy using a 15 MV linear accelerator. Six rats served as controls. Two cylindrical collimators of 2 mm and 3 mm aperture were used. The diameters of the spherical 80% isodose were 3.7 and 4.7 mm, respectively (Table 1). Irradiation was applied to a predefined area in the right frontal lobe. 19 months after irradiation local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) was measured by the autoradiographic method in one animal of each dose group between 20 and 50 Gy. 9 and 19 months after irradiation, half of the animals of each group were sacrificed for brain histology. All animals irradiated with 100 Gy were sacrificed 7 months after irradiation.RESULTS: An increase of local cerebral blood flow was measured in brain structures within the 80% isodose in animals irradiated with 50 Gy (Figure 3) compared to the contralateral hemisphere. Measurements close to necrotic areas showed a strong decrease of local cerebral blood flow (Figure 1). A volume increase of the irradiated hemisphere was seen after 19 months (Figure 2). The histologic examination after 19 months showed necrotic areas in the 30-50 Gy groups (Figure 4b) but not in the 20 Gy groups (Figure 4c). The animals who received 100 Gy demonstrated brain necrosis within 9 months after irradiation (Figure 4a). At both points in time the groups irradiated with the 3-mm collimator showed more pronounced histomorphologic and functional changes compared to the groups irradiated with the 2-mm collimator.CONCLUSION: Alterations of the local cerebral blood flow were measured as a late effect after single dose irradiation. The alterations of the local cerebral blood flow could be explained by the histomorphologic changes of the blood vessels. Using a semi-quantitative classification a dose, time and volume dependence for the endpoint radionecrosis was seen.",Included

2400,"Casticin inhibits growth and enhances ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis through the suppression of STAT3 signaling cascade Casticin (CTC), one of the major components of Vitex rotundifolia L., has been reported to exert significant beneficial pharmacological activities and can function as an antiprolactin, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, analgesic, and immunomodulatory agent. This study aimed at investigating whether the proapoptotic effects of CTC may be mediated through the abrogation of signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3) signaling pathway in a variety of human tumor cells. We found that CTC significantly decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner and suppressed cell proliferation in 786-O, YD-8, and HN-9 cells. CTC also induced programmed cell death that was found to be mediated via caspase-3 activation and induction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Interestingly, CTC repressed both constitutive and interleukin-6-induced STAT3 activation in 786-O and YD-8 cells but only affected constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation in HN-9 cells. Moreover, CTC could potentiate ionizing radiation-induced apoptotic effects leading to the downregulation of STAT3 activation and thus may be used in combination with radiation against diverse malignancies.",Excluded

Exposure to a reduced gravity environment affects human anatomy and physiology. Countermeasures to restore homeostatic states within the human body have begun. The pathophysiological effects of exposure to microgravity, on the neurological system, are, however, still not clear. NASA has scheduled deep space exploration of extraterrestrial locations such as the Moon and Mars in the 2030s. Adverse health effects related to the human exposure to microgravity from previous, relatively shorter missions have been documented. A lengthy deep space travel to Mars could be overburdened by significant adverse health effects. Astronauts demonstrate a significant increase in the number of many types of circulating white blood cells (neutrophils, monocytes, T-helper cells, and B-cells) but a decrease in natural killer cells. It is unclear whether these changes are due to increased production or decreased clearance of these cells. In this review, viral reactivation in astronauts will be discussed, including the occurrence of clinical cases before, during, or after spaceflight and their management during and after flight.

3573,"Dosimetric, radiobiological and secondary cancer risk evaluation in head-and-neck three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, and volumetric modulated arc therapy: A phantom study This analysis estimated secondary cancer risks after volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and compared those risks to the risks associated with other modalities of head-and-neck (H&N) radiotherapy. Images of H&N anthropomorphic phantom were acquired with a computed tomography scanner and exported via digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) standards to a treatment planning system. Treatment plans were performed using a VMAT dual-arc technique, a nine-field intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique, and a four-field three-dimensional conformal therapy (3DCRT) technique. The prescription dose was 66.0 Gy for all three techniques, but to accommodate the range of dosimeter responses, we delivered a single dose of 6.60 Gy to the isocenter. The lifetime risk for secondary cancers was estimated according to National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) Report 116. VMAT delivered the lowest maximum doses to esophagus (23 Gy), and normal brain (40 Gy). In comparison, maximum doses for 3DCRT were 74% and 40%, higher than those for VMAT for the esophagus, and normal brain, respectively. The normal tissue complication probability and equivalent uniform dose for the brain (2.1%, 0.9%, 0.8% and 3.8 Gy, 2.6 Gy, 2.3 Gy) and esophagus (4.2%, 0.7%, 0.4% and 3.7 Gy, 2.2 Gy, 1.8 Gy) were calculated for the 3DCRT, IMRT and VMAT respectively. Fractional esophagus OAR volumes receiving more than 20 Gy were 3.6% for VMAT, 23.6% for IMRT, and 100% for 3DCRT. The calculations for mean doses, NTCP, EUD and OAR volumes suggest that the risk of secondary cancer induction after VMAT is lower than after IMRT and 3DCRT.

Interestingly, TC exhibits selectivity towards Abeta42 fibrils compared to other abnormal protein aggregates. TC probe show nanomolar binding affinity (Ka = 1.72 x 10(7) M(-1)) towards Abeta42 aggregates and also displace ThT bound to Abeta42 fibrils due to its high binding affinity. The Abeta42 fibril-specific red-shift in the absorption spectra of TC responsible for the observed colorimetric optical output has been attributed to micro-environment change around the probe from hydrophilic-like to hydrophobic-like nature. The binding site, binding energy and changes in optical properties observed for TC upon interaction with Abeta42 fibrils have been further validated by molecular docking and time dependent density functional theory studies.",Excluded
2519,"Effects of obesity on noninvasive test results in patients with suspected cardiac ischemia: Insights from the PROMISE trial BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), but adiposity may mimic symptoms of CAD and reduce the accuracy of diagnostic testing.METHODS: Patients from the PROMISE trial (n=8889) were classified according to body mass index (BMI). We assessed relationships between BMI, physician's preference of functional test, test positivity, and results of invasive coronary angiography (Cath) using logistic regression models.RESULTS: Nearly half (48%) of the patients had BMI>=30kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and 20% had BMI>=35. Providers were more likely to prefer nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) over other functional tests as BMI increased. The rate of test positivity with coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was not different (10% vs. 12%) in patients with BMI >=35 vs. < 35. The same was true for stress echocardiogram and stress electrocardiogram (positivity 8-13%, P>0.8 for both). In contrast, MPI was significantly more likely to be positive in those with BMI >=35 vs. <35 (18% vs. 13%; P=0.001). The likelihood of obstructive CAD at Cath did not differ with BMI >=35 vs. <35 in patients having CTA (52% vs. 59%, P=0.22), but among MPI patients, Cath positivity was only 29% with BMI >=35 vs. 48% with BMI <35 (P=0.005). Radiation exposure increased with higher BMI in both MPI and CTA groups.CONCLUSIONS: Increasing levels of obesity adversely affect the diagnostic yield of MPI more than CTA.

3586,"The relationship between mood symptoms and neuropsychological function in breast cancer survivors Objective: Breast cancer survivors show neuropsychological deficits in domains such as language and memory that are suspected to be a result of the harmful effects of cancer treatments. Mood symptoms may exacerbate these problems, however, little is known about the exact relationship between these variables. Participants and Methods: We examined a group of 87 breast cancer survivors, mean age 58.7 years, who had received diagnoses of breast cancer 2-22 years prior (mean 6.1 years). Participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests that assessed intellectual function, executive function, and memory, and several self-report questionnaires that assessed mood, fatigue, and quality of life. Result(s): Pearson analyses demonstrated significant negative correlations between scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer & Brown, 1996) and the Full Scale IQ,VerbalComprehension Index, and Processing Speed Index scores of theWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III(Wechsler, 1997). BDI-II scores also showed significant negative correlations with some measures of executive function, but not with measures of memory. Analysis of variance showed that breast cancer survivors who had been treated with chemotherapy reported more symptoms of depression than individuals who had not been treated with chemotherapy, F = 9.51, p = .003. A similar pattern was not found for individuals who had been treated with radiation. Patients' history of chemotherapy and radiation treatment did not show any relationship to subsequent neuropsychological function. Conclusion(s): Results suggest that elevated mood symptoms may be related to problems in some domains of neuropsychological performance in breast cancer survivors. Individuals who had received chemotherapy appeared more likely to experience subsequent mood problems. Further investigation is needed to determine if mood changes may increase susceptibility to the cognitive deficits experienced by breast cancer survivors. Acknowledgement: Study funded by Susan G.

Six underwent postmission optical coherence tomography (OCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 4 had lumbar punctures (LP). Approximately 300 astronauts were queried regarding visual changes during space missions.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Refractive change, fundus photograph examination, retina OCT, orbital MRI, LP opening pressures, and examination of visual acuity data.RESULTS: After 6 months of space flight, 7 astronauts had ophthalmic findings, consisting of disc edema in 5, globe flattening in 5, choroidal folds in 5, cotton wool spots (CWS) in 3, nerve fiber layer thickening by OCT in 6, and decreased near vision in 6 astronauts. Five of 7 with near vision complaints had a hyperopic shift >=+0.50 diopters (D) between pre/postmission spherical equivalent refraction in 1 or both eyes (range, +0.50 to +1.75 D). These 5 showed globe flattening on MRI. Lumbar punctures performed in the 4 with disc edema documented opening pressures of 22, 21, 28, and 28.5 cm H(2)O performed 60, 19, 12, and 57 days postmission, respectively.

Addition of SK to the medium prevented a reduction of the viability of mature (14 days) dissociated neocortical cell culture from 1-2-day-old rats, induced by a transfer of the culture to a blood serum protein-deficient medium. In a 7-day culture SK potentiated the decrease in the cell viability. In organotypical cultures, with the use of electron microscopy, it was found that SK in concentration used prevented the development of destructive changes in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons of explants, induced by a deficit in serum proteins. The neurons contained numerous mitochondria, some of which had only a few cristae. Signs of destruction were observed only in neuronal nuclei.

The functional role of the amino acid residues contributing to the channel pore in neuronal nicotinic alpha3 receptors is not well understood. We characterized the contribution of TMD2 position V7' to channel gating in neuronal nicotinic alpha3 receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to substitute position alpha3 (V7') with four different amino acids (A, F, S, or Y) and coexpressed each mutant subunit with wild-type (WT) beta2 or beta4 subunits in Xenopus oocytes. Whole-cell voltage clamp experiments show that substitution for an alanine, serine, or phenylalanine decreased by 2.3-6.2-fold the ACh-EC(50) for alpha3beta2 and alpha3beta4 receptor subtypes. Interestingly, mutation V7'Y did not produce a significant change in ACh-EC(50) when coexpressed with the beta2 subunit but showed a significant approximately two-fold increase with beta4. Similar responses were obtained with nicotine as the agonist. The antagonist sensitivity of the mutant channels was assessed by using dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHbetaE) and methyllycaconitine (MLA). The apparent potency of DHbetaE as an antagonist increased by approximately 3.7- and 11-fold for the alpha3beta2 V7'S and V7'F mutants, respectively, whereas no evident changes in antagonist potency were observed for the V7'A and V7'Y mutants. The V7'S and V7'F mutations increase MLA antagonist potency for the alpha3beta4 receptor by approximately 6.2- and approximately 9.3-fold, respectively. The V7'A mutation selectively increases the MLA antagonist potency for the alpha3beta4 receptor by approximately 18.7-fold.

In this study, we evaluated the ability of irradiation to regulate the transcription of a recombinant replication-defective adenovirus vector, Ad.Egr-1/lacZ, containing the radiation-inducible Egr-1 promoter driving the beta-galactosidase reporter gene in glioma cells. Transcripts of the Egr-1 gene in human and rat glioma cells were induced following irradiation with as little as 2 Gy. This dose was 10-fold less than previously reported, and comparable to doses of irradiation used clinically in standard fractionated radiotherapy for brain tumors. When 9L rat gliosarcoma cells were infected with Ad.Egr-1/lacZ in vitro and exposed to 2 Gy of external beam irradiation, there was a threefold increase in beta-galactosidase expression. Irradiation of intracerebral 9L tumors infected with the Ad.Egr-1/lacZ virus, using either external beam radiotherapy (2 Gy) or the thymidine analog 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine radiolabeled with the Auger electron emitter iodine-125 ([125I]IdUrd), also resulted in increased beta-galactosidase activity of the tumor cells.

Method(s): The Biplane-DTS consists of multiple components including 3D graphic models of the imaging system and patient, an interactive graphical user interface, a data acquisition module to collect geometry and exposure parameters, the computer graphics processing unit, and functions for determining which parts of the patient graphic skin surface are within the beam and for calculating dose. The dose is calculated to individual points on the patient graphic using premeasured calibration files of entrance skin dose per mAs including backscatter; corrections are applied for field area, distance from the focal spot and patient table and pad attenuation when appropriate. The agreement of the calculated patient skin dose and its spatial distribution with measured values was evaluated in 2D and 3D for simulated procedure conditions using a PMMA block phantom and an SK-150 head phantom, respectively. Dose values calculated by the Biplane-DTS were compared to the measurements made on the phantom surface with radiochromic film and a calibrated ionization chamber, which was also used to calibrate the DTS. The agreement with measurements was specifically evaluated with variation in kVp, gantry angle, and field size. Result(s): The dose tracking system that was developed is able to acquire data from the two x-ray gantries on a biplane imaging system and calculate the skin dose for each exposure pulse to those vertices of a patient graphic that are determined to be in the beam. The calculations are done in real-time with a typical graphic update time of 30 ms and an average vertex separation of 3 mm.With appropriate corrections applied, the Biplane-DTS was able to determine the entrance dose within 6% and the spatial distribution of the dose within 4% compared to the measurements with the ionization chamber and film for the SK150 head phantom. The cumulative dose for overlapping fields from both gantries showed similar agreement. Conclusion(s): The Biplane-DTS can provide a good estimate of the peak skin dose and cumulative skin dose distribution during biplane neurointerventional procedures. Real-time display of this information should help the physician manage patient dose to reduce the risk of radiation-induced skin injuries.

3144,"Regeneration of dopaminergic neurons after 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesion in planarian brain Planarians have robust regenerative ability dependent on X-ray-sensitive pluripotent stem cells, called neoblasts. Here, we report that planarians can regenerate dopaminergic neurons after selective degeneration of these neurons caused by treatment with a dopaminergic neurotoxin (6-hydroxydopamine; 6-OHDA). This suggests that planarians have a system to sense the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and to recruit stem cells to produce dopaminergic neurons to recover brain morphology and function. We confirmed that X-ray-irradiated planarians do not regenerate brain dopaminergic neurons after 6-OHDA-induced lesioning, suggesting that newly generated dopaminergic neurons are indeed derived from pluripotent stem cells. However, we found that the majority of regenerated dopaminergic neurons were 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-negative cells. Therefore, we carefully analyzed when proliferating stem cells became committed to become dopaminergic neurons during regeneration by a combination of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine pulse-chase experiments, immunostaining/in situ hybridization, and 5-fluorouracil treatment. The results strongly suggested that G(2) -phase stem cells become committed to dopaminergic neurons in the mesenchymal space around the brain, after migration from the trunk region following S-phase. These new findings obtained from planarian regeneration provide hints about how to conduct cell-transplantation therapy for future regenerative medicine.",Excluded
3360,"ADAM23: Biomarker for nonmelanoma skin cancer disease progression The ADAMs (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) comprise a family of multidomain transmembrane and secreted proteins involved in cytokine and growth factor release, proteolysis and cell adhesion. Multiple family members have been shown to play a role in cancer formation and disease progression. Decreased ADAM23 expression has been demonstrated in human breast, colon, gastric, head and neck, brain and pancreatic cancers and is believed to be associated with a more malignant or metastatic phenotype. Substantially more than 1 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) occur annually in the United States according to the American Cancer Society. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are the two major types of NMSC and most are related to chronic sun exposure. We have demonstrated by microarray analysis that ADAM23 expression is decreased in human keratinocytes chronically irradiated with a solar-simulated light source. Using a human SCC skin carcinogenesis model, we have demonstrated that decreased ADAM23 expression correlates with disease progression. Preliminary immunohistochemical analysis of human SCC samples also demonstrates decreased ADAM23 expression. We believe that ADAM23 may serve as a biomarker of human skin SCC disease progression. This may be important for earlier detection and for the possible development of targeted therapy that may serve as an alternative to potentially disfiguring surgical treatment.",Excluded

In 61% of them neurocirculatory dystonia was found, 39% of patients revealed dyscirculatory encephalopathy. Alongside with dystonic disorders structural changes of vessels were detected. Asthenoneurosis diagnosed in 97% of patients was recognized as a key syndrome in 53%, while in 23%--obsessional-phobic syndrome dominated, in 7%--depressive syndrome and in 14%--psycho-organic syndrome were at the foreground. Somatic status in most patients (67%) was burdened by diseases of digestive tract. 191 patients revealed considerable immune imbalance. In 95 patients (33%) it was less pronounced and consisted in moderate decrease of TPR/TPS ratio. Degrees of immune and neurological disorders correlated closely. The conclusion was made that low-dose radiation induces primary damage of immunity and vessels with secondary nervous system involvement. That is why connection between neurological symptoms and radiation in subjects who took part in liquidation of Chernobyl accident aftermath may be considered probable only in association with immune and circulatory disorders.",Included
3307,"Blocking GABAA neurotransmission in the interposed nuclei: effects on conditioned and unconditioned eyeblinks The interposed nuclei (IN) of the intermediate cerebellum are critical components of the circuits that control associative learning of eyeblinks and other defensive reflexes in mammals. The IN, which represent the sole output of the intermediate cerebellum, receive massive GABAergic input from Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex and are thought to contribute to the acquisition and performance of classically conditioned eyeblinks. The specific role of deep cerebellar nuclei and the cerebellar cortex in eyeblink conditioning are not well understood. One group of studies reported that blocking GABA(A) neurotransmission in the IN altered the time profile of conditioned responses (CRs), suggesting that the main function of the cerebellar cortex is to shape the timing of CRs. Other studies reported that blocking GABA(A) neurotransmission in the IN abolished CRs, indicating a more fundamental involvement of the cerebellar cortex in CR generation. When examining this controversy, we hypothesized that the behavioral effect of GABA(A) blockers could be dose-dependent. The IN of classically conditioned rabbits were injected with high and low doses of picrotoxin and gabazine. Both GABA(A) blockers produced tonic eyelid closure. A high dose of both drugs abolished CRs, whereas a less complete block of GABA(A)-mediated inputs with substantially smaller drug doses shortened CR latencies. In addition, low doses of picrotoxin facilitated the expression of unconditioned eyeblinks evoked by trigeminal stimulation. These results suggest that the intermediate cerebellum regulates both associative and non-associative components of the eyeblink reflex, and that behavioral effects of blocking Purkinje cell action on IN neurons are related to collective changes in cerebellar signals and in the excitability of extra-cerebellar eyeblink circuits.",Excluded
3545,"In vivo imaging of endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression after radiosurgery in an animal model of arteriovenous malformation Focussed radiosurgery may provide a means of inducing molecular changes on the luminal surface of diseased endothelium to allow targeted delivery of novel therapeutic compounds. We investigated the potential of ionizing radiation to induce surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) on endothelial cells (EC) in vitro and in vivo, to assess their suitability as vascular targets in irradiated arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Cultured brain microvascular EC were irradiated by linear accelerator at single doses of 0, 5, 15 or 25 Gy and expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 measured by qRT-PCR, Western, ELISA and immunocytochemistry. In vivo, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence optical imaging using Xenolight 750-conjugated ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 antibodies examined luminal biodistribution over 84 days in a rat AVM model after Gamma Knife surgery at a single 15 Gy dose. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were minimally expressed on untreated EC in vitro. Doses of 15 and 25 Gy stimulated expression equally; 5 Gy was not different from the unirradiated. In vivo, normal vessels did not bind or retain the fluorescent probes, however binding was significant in AVM vessels. No additive increases in probe binding were found in response to radiosurgery at a dose of 15 Gy. In summary, radiation induces adhesion molecule expression in vitro but elevated baseline levels in AVM vessels precludes further induction in vivo. These molecules may be suitable targets in irradiated vessels without hemodynamic derangement, but not AVMs. These findings demonstrate the importance of using flow-modulated, pre-clinical animal models for validating candidate proteins for vascular targeting in irradiated AVMs.",Included

Program Description: The patient was referred to the clinic by his oncologist for evaluation of bilateral shoulder pain. He had recently undergone esophagectomy with right thoracotomy. Before surgery, the patient had no shoulder pain; after surgery, he developed severe pain and restricted range of motion in the bilateral shoulders, worse on the right side. He had difficulty with overhead reaching and use of his right upper limb in activities of daily living. On examination, he was noted to have significant winging of the right scapula along the medial border when at rest and with a wall pushup, an inability to forward flex the right shoulder past 80degree and abduct past 70degree, atrophy of the right posterior shoulder girdle, and a large well-healed scar along the right lateral scapular border. Setting(s): Outpatient musculoskeletal clinic. Result(s): An electromyography and nerve conduction study was performed and revealed both long thoracic and spinal accessory neuropathy. Subsequent ultrasound imaging of the shoulder revealed a neuroma deep to the scar in the right mid axillary line, suspicious for a laceration of the long thoracic nerve. The patient was referred to the orthotics department to be fitted for a scapulothoracic orthosis. Discussion(s): Although rare, scapular winging can present after surgery due to traumatic, iatrogenic, or idiopathic factors. Prior studies have shown that postoperative scapular winging can have a neurogenic etiology, with isolated injury to the long thoracic, spinal accessory, or dorsal scapular nerve. In this unusual case, the patient developed injury to a combination of nerves, which led his symptoms. Conclusion(s): Postoperative scapular winging can be associated with concomitant long thoracic and spinal accessory nerve injury.",Excluded

These aneurysms can be either angiographically coiled or surgically clipped. Surgery on these aneurysms can sometimes be quite tricky and also dangerous. Wide base, large size and irregular dome are aneurysm related factors that can affect conduct of surgery. Wide exposure, diligent isolation of perforators, prevention of vessel kinking and obliteration and selection of the most appropriate clip are essential for success Case Report: R.S. was admitted to our Emergency Department after sudden loss of consciousness (GCS 4/15) due to atypical intracerebral hemorrhage. A CT-angiography scan showed a right parietal hematoma with evidence of ruptured aneurysm in the proximal right middle cerebral artery (rMCA). She was admitted in our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after surgical hematoma evacuation and aneurysmal clipping. After 6 h, we performed TCD and TCCD to detect willis circulation and measuring pulsatily index in cerebral vessels in order to exclude intracranial hypertension. Ultrasound examination showed normal pulsatily index and the absence of flow and signal at depth and area related to rMCA. After neurosurgical consultation, a brain MRI was performed and it showed DWI images as hazy, hyperintense signals in the rMCA area (Fig) confirming TCD report.

Result(s): Among 11 patients that complained of decreased visual acuity (DVA), 6 did not have signs of intracranial pressure: 5 of them had an invasion of OP. Two had normal fundi, 3 abnormal fundi. Three had a supraoptic mass with contiguous involvement of the chiasma. Another patient had DVA and endocrinological symptoms. The MRI showed pineal tumor. Biopsy revealed a germinoma. CSF bHCG were raised (90UI/L). This ""bifocal"" ""secreting' tumor was treated with chemotherapy and focal radiation on both primaries. He relapsed with a diffuse ventricular and meningeal dissemination. The review showed that the thickening of optic nerves with contrast enhancement was overlooked, and optic nerve wasn't included in the radiation field. The last patient had DVA.

2604,"Furosemide potentiates the anticonvulsant action of valproate in the mouse maximal electroshock seizure model Accumulating evidence indicates that furosemide (FUR, a loop diuretic) exerts the anticonvulsant action in various in vitro and in vivo experiments. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the influence of FUR on the protective action of numerous conventional and newer antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine [CBZ], lamotrigine [LTG], oxcarbazepine [OXC], phenobarbital [PB], topiramate [TPM] and valproate [VPA]) in the mouse maximal electroshock seizure (MES) model. Results indicate that FUR (up to 100mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before the test) neither altered the threshold for electroconvulsions nor protected the animals against MES-induced seizures in mice. FUR (100 mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced the anticonvulsant effects of VPA in the MES test by reducing its ED(50) value from 230.4 to 185.4 mg/kg (P<0.05). In contrast, FUR at 100 mg/kg had no significant effect on the antielectroshock action of the remaining drugs tested (CBZ, LTG, OXC, PB, and TPM) in mice. Estimation of free plasma and total brain VPA concentrations revealed that the observed interaction between FUR and VPA in the MES test was pharmacodynamic in nature because neither free plasma nor total brain VPA concentrations were altered after i.p. administration of FUR. In conclusion, one can ascertain that the selective potentiation of the antielectroshock action of VPA by FUR and lack of any pharmacokinetic interactions between drugs, make this combination of pivotal importance for epileptic patients treated with VPA and received FUR from other than epilepsy reasons.",Excluded

In these two structures we evaluated spike amplitude, area, duration, rise time and mean total firing rate. The recording spike density was higher in the STN than in the SNr (94% vs. 28%). Microelectrode recordings showed a larger spike area and amplitude in the SNr than in the STN ([mean+/-SD] amplitude: 46.7+/-31.1 vs. 36.3+/-29.6 microV; area: 25.6+/-24.2 vs. 36.7+/-21.4 microVmsec), a higher total firing rate at rest in the SNr than in the STN (78.6+/-53.5 vs. 61.9+/-40.8 Hz), and a longer duration and rise time in the SNr than in the STN (duration: 2.0+/-1 vs. 1.3+/-0.6 ms; rise time: 0.95+/-0.6 vs. 0.67+/-0.3 ms).

Hepatotoxicity is a concern in NET patients receiving TARE, due to longer survival and exposure to additional radioactive therapies. The body surface area (BSA) method for prescribing <sup>90</sup>Y resin microspheres may under- or overestimate the ideal administered activity, resulting in radiation doses that may undertreat tumors or over-expose normal liver. The purpose of this study was to compare voxel-based dosimetry of healthy liver dose based on <sup>99m</sup>Tc-macroaggregated albumin (MAA) and <sup>90</sup>Y-Bremsstrahlung imaging. Material(s) and Method(s): From a larger consecutive series of 127 patients, a retrospective review was performed for 26 patients who underwent 34 <sup>90</sup>Y-microsphere treatments (SIR-Spheres, Sirtex Medical) from March 2016 to March 2019. For each treatment, the liver and tumors were segmented manually using MIM v7 SurePlan (MIM Software Inc., Cleveland, Ohio) using the CT portion of the <sup>90</sup>Y-Bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT study. Voxel-based dosimetry was performed using pre-treatment <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA imaging for predicting dose from treatment and <sup>90</sup>Y-Bremsstrahlung imaging to estimate final therapeutic dose. Dose calculations were performed assuming local deposition within the MIM SurePlan dosimetry platform. Result(s): A total of 390 tumors were segmented across 34 treatments. Tumor count per patient ranged from 1 to 32 (9.7 +/- 9.6). Tumor liver burden ranged from 1.2% to 66% (mean, 16.1%; median, 6.1%.) Whole liver volumes ranged from 1139 mL to 4780 mL (2124 +/- 867 mL). Healthy liver volumes ranged from 1011 mL to 2763 mL (1671 +/- 472 mL). The per-patient mean liver dose was found to be 31.6 +/- 11.9 Gy, and the mean healthy liver dose was found to be 28.2 +/- 12.8 Gy. A strong correlation was observed when comparing healthy liver absorbed dose measured by post-treatment imaging with what was predicted from pre-treatment <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA mapping (slope = 0.87 +/- 0.05; intercept = 3.0 +/- 1.5 Gy; r<sup>2</sup> = 0.924).

3483,"Radiation arteritis: a contraindication to carotid stenting? BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) for high-risk anatomic lesions is accepted practice. Neck irradiation and radiotherapy-induced arteritis are common indications. The clinical outcomes of CAS for radiation arteritis have been poorly defined.METHODS: A prospective database of patients undergoing CAS at a tertiary referral academic medical center was maintained from 1999 to 2006. Patients undergoing primary carotid artery stenting for significant atherosclerotic (ASOD) and radiotherapy (XRT)-induced occlusive disease were analyzed. Life-table analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Cox proportional hazard analysis or Fisher's exact test was performed to identify factors associated with outcomes. Data are presented as the mean +/- SEM unless otherwise indicated.RESULTS: During the study period, 150 patients underwent primary CAS, 75% with embolic protection. Fifty-eight percent were symptomatic. One hundred twenty-seven (85%) were treated for ASOD, and 23 (15%) had XRT. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 1% for ASOD and 0% for XRT (P = NS); overall survival at 3 years was equivalent. There was no significant difference in major adverse event rates as defined by the Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) trial between the groups. The 3-year neurologic event-free rate was 85% for ASOD and 87% for XRT (P = NS). Late asymptomatic occlusions were seen only in XRT patients. The 3-year freedom from restenosis rate was significantly worse for the XRT group, at 20%, vs 74% for the ASOD group (P < .05). Likewise, the 3-year patency rate was also worse for the XRT group, at 91%, vs 100% for ASOD by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P < .05). No factor was predictive of occlusion or stenosis by Cox proportional hazards analysis.CONCLUSION: CAS for radiation arteritis has poor long-term anatomic outcome and can present with late asymptomatic occlusions. These findings suggest that these patients require closer postoperative surveillance and raise the question of whether CAS is appropriate for carotid occlusive lesions caused by radiation arteritis.",Included
2652,"Baseline characteristics and response to GH replacement of hypopituitary patients previously irradiated for pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma: data from the Pfizer International Metabolic Database OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis whether the effects of GH replacement therapy in adults could be affected by prior pituitary irradiation, the baseline characteristics and response to GH were evaluated in adults with severe GH deficiency (GHD), who had received or not irradiation for the treatment of pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma.DESIGN: Data from 447 patients, who had received radiotherapy (427 in addition to surgery), and 630 patients, who were operated on but not irradiated for their tumour, were retrieved from Pfizer International Metabolic Database (KIMS) and compared at baseline and 1 and 2 years following the onset of GH replacement.RESULTS: Irradiated and non-irradiated patients exhibited the expected phenotype of GHD at baseline. However, irradiated patients had a greater impairment in the quality of life (QoL), a higher fat mass, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and a lower bone mineral content (BMC) than non-irradiated patients. Treatment with GH induced similar changes in both groups. After 1 year of GH replacement, there was an increase in serum IGF-I and fat-free mass, a reduction in fat mass and an improvement in QoL, all changes being equivalent in irradiated and non-irradiated patients. The lipid profile also improved with the irradiated patients showing a better response. These beneficial effects were maintained and the BMC also increased in both groups by the second year of treatment.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that prior irradiation for pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma does not compromise the beneficial effects of GH replacement therapy.",Included

2598,"Measurements and analysis of leakage neutron spectra from multiple-slab sample assemblies comprising W,U,C, and CH<inf>2</inf> with D-T neutron irradiation The accelerator driven subcritical system (ADS) is regarded as a safe and clean nuclear power system, which can be used for the transmutation of nuclear waste and the breeding of nuclear fuel. In this study, in order to validate nuclear data and the neutron transportation performance of the materials related to ADS, we measured the leakage neutron spectra from multiple-slab sample assemblies using 14.8 MeV D-T neutrons. Two types of assemblies comprising A-1 (W+U+C+CH<inf>2</inf>) and A-2 (U+C+CH<inf>2</inf>) were both built up gradually starting with the first wall. The measured spectra were compared with those calculated using the Monte Carlo code neutron transport coed (MCNP)-4C. A comparison of the results showed that the experimental leakage neutron spectra for both A-1 or A-2 were reproduced well by the three evaluated nuclear data libraries with discrepancies of less than 15% (A-1) and 12% (A-2), except when below 3 MeV. For 2-cm and 5-cm uranium samples, the CENDL-3.1 calculations exhibited large discrepancies in the energy range of 2-8 MeV and above 13 MeV. Thus, the CENDL-3.1 library for uranium should be reevaluated, especially around this energy range. It was significant that the leakage neuron spectra changed clearly when the latest material layer was added during the building of assemblies A-1 and A-2. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
2941,"Prospective study of fatigue in localized prostate cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy The objectives were to (1) prospectively evaluate fatigue utilizing validated instruments in patients with localized prostate cancer, and (2) examine the relationships between fatigue, depression, quality of life, and sleep disturbance. The instruments used included: Piper Fatigue Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostate Scale. Data on cancer stage, prostate specific antigen levels, hematocrit, patient's body weight and radiation dosage were recorded. Patients were evaluated preradiotherapy, middle of radiotherapy, completion of radiotherapy, and at 4-5 weeks follow-up. Thirty-six veterans with localized prostate cancer were studied. Mean age was 66.9 years (range 55-79). Duration of treatment was 7-8 weeks. Univariate procedure and Wilcoxon Signed Rank-test were used to examine changes in pretreatment scores for each of the three subsequent study periods. To adjust for multiple comparisons Bonferroni test was used. Spearman Correlations were calculated among parameters. No significant changes were noted in mean scores of hematocrit and body weight during the study period. On the Piper Fatigue Scale, adjusted for multiple comparisons, the median scores were significantly higher at completion of radiotherapy as compared with preradiotherapy values. Three patients (8%) were experienced fatigue according to Piper Fatigue Scale before treatment as compared to nine patients (25%) at completion of radiotherapy. On Prostate Cancer Specific and Physical Well Being subscales of the Functional Assessment for Prostate Cancer Therapy, the scores were significantly lower at middle and completion of radiotherapy than at pretreatment. At preradiotherapy, middle of radiotherapy, completion of radiotherapy and follow-up evaluation, patients scoring higher on the Piper Fatigue Scale were more likely to report a poorer quality of Physical Well Being on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostates. No significant changes were noted in the Beck Depression Inventory and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores during treatment. Eight patients scored 10 or more on the Beck Depression Inventory before starting radiotherapy, suggesting depressive symptomatology. Of these, only seven patients scored 10 or more at completion of treatment. The incidence of fatigue is lower in our study than in previously published data. A relationship exists between fatigue scores and physical well being subscale scores. Higher scores on the Piper Fatigue Scale at the completion of radiotherapy, as well as no changes on depression and sleepiness scales, suggest that fatigue may not be the result of depression or sleep disturbance. Based upon our previous work, we propose that the physical expression of fatigue may be secondary to a decline in neuromuscular efficiency and enhanced muscle fatigue.",Excluded
2527,"Is autonomic modulation different between European and Chinese astronauts? PURPOSE: The objective was to investigate autonomic control in groups of European and Chinese astronauts and to identify similarities and differences.METHODS: Beat-to-beat heart rate and finger blood pressure, brachial blood pressure, and respiratory frequency were measured from 10 astronauts (five European taking part in three different space missions and five Chinese astronauts taking part in two different space missions). Data recording was performed in the supine and standing positions at least 10 days before launch, and 1, 3, and 10 days after return. Cross-correlation analysis of heart rate and systolic pressure was used to assess cardiac baroreflex modulation. A fixed breathing protocol was performed to measure respiratory sinus arrhythmia and low-frequency power of systolic blood pressure variability.RESULTS: Although baseline cardiovascular parameters before spaceflight were similar in all astronauts in the supine position, a significant increase in sympathetic activity and a decrease in vagal modulation occurred in the European astronauts when standing; spaceflight resulted in a remarkable vagal decrease in European astronauts only. Similar baseline supine and standing values for heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and respiratory frequency were shown in both groups. Standing autonomic control was based on a balance of higher vagal and sympathetic modulation in European astronauts.CONCLUSION: Post-spaceflight orthostatic tachycardia was observed in all European astronauts, whereas post-spaceflight orthostatic tachycardia was significantly reduced in Chinese astronauts. The basis for orthostatic intolerance is not apparent; however, many possibilities can be considered and need to be further investigated, such as genetic diversities between races, astronaut selection, training, and nutrition, etc.",Excluded

2936,"Nitric oxide and its influence on oscillations of collicular responses in developing rats We investigated the influence of modulating NO synthesis on oscillatory components of ON and OFF evoked field potentials in developing rat superior colliculus. Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in neuronal transmission by adjusting neurotransmitter release in adults and in stabilizing synaptic connections in developing brains. NO synthesis was decreased by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase (NOS) with an acute microinjection of N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME); whereas NO synthesis was augmented by an acute microinjection of L-arginine (L-ARG). The study is focused on rhythmic activity by analyzing fast Fourier transform (FFT). Collicular responses were recorded in anesthetized rats, at post-natal days (PND) 13-19 and adults. This time window was chosen because it is centered on eye opening. NO down- and upregulation resulted in a dual effect depending on age and response-type. NO synthesis inhibition decreased the magnitude of oscillations in ON responses in the youngest animals (PND13-PND14), whereas oscillations of frequencies higher than 20 Hz in OFF responses were increased in all age groups of developing rats. In adults NO downregulation increased oscillations in ON responses and decreased oscillations in OFF responses. L-arginine application produced effects opposite to those seen with L-NAME. Our data together with results reported in the literature suggest that the temporal patterns of the evoked activity are NO-dependent. This sculpting action of the evoked firing may play a role in the synchronization of action potentials in afferent axons which in turn contributes to synaptic stabilization.",Excluded
2778,"A rat in vitro model for the measurement of multiple excitability properties of cutaneous axons OBJECTIVE: To establish an in vitro model for measurement of the excitability properties of cutaneous sensory axons.METHODS: We used a saphenous skin-nerve preparation from adult rat in combination with computerized threshold tracking. We measured strength-duration time constant, the recovery of excitability after a supramaximal stimulus and the accommodation to conditioning subthreshold polarizing stimuli (threshold electrotonus, current-threshold relationship) and compared these with previously published recordings from sensory axons in human median nerve.RESULTS: Threshold electrotonus and the amplitude of superexcitability were indistinguishable between human median nerve in vivo and rat saphenous nerve in vitro, but several excitability parameters were significantly different in the rat: strength-duration time constant was significantly shorter (0.19+/-0.01 vs. 0.53+/-0.02 ms); the refractory period was shorter (1.9+/-1.1 ms vs. 3.5+/-1.0 ms) and late subexcitability was smaller (6.3+/-0.3% vs. 11.3+/-0.5%); thirdly, during recording of current-threshold relationship, rat nerves displayed more inward rectification to strong hyperpolarizing currents. Parameters were stable over more than 3h.CONCLUSIONS: Excitability changes of sensory Abeta-fibres can be reliably studied in the rat in vitro and are qualitatively similar to humans.SIGNIFICANCE: This rat model will facilitate pharmacological studies of nerve excitability and work on models of neuropathy.",Excluded
3254,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation reveals abnormal plastic response to premotor cortex stimulation in schizophrenia BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia may be characterized by abnormal plastic modulation in cortical neuronal circuits. Activation of premotor cortex using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) produces suppression of cortical excitability in primary motor cortex. We hypothesized that premotor rTMS would cause less suppression of motor cortical excitability in patients with schizophrenia than in control subjects.METHODS: Twelve patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and twelve healthy control subjects underwent subthreshold rTMS to the premotor area in a 15-min conditioning train. Measurements of primary motor cortical excitability (motor evoked potential; MEP), the resting motor threshold (RMT), and cortical inhibition (CI) were taken before and after the rTMS.RESULTS: There was no difference in RMT between groups at baseline, although the patient group had less CI than the control group at baseline. Following rTMS, the change in both MEP size and RMT between groups was significant. After rTMS, MEP size was suppressed in the control group and increased in the patient group, whereas RMT increased in the normal control group and decreased in the patient group.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate abnormal brain responses to rTMS applied to the premotor cortex that appear to relate to reduced motor cortical inhibition.",Excluded

3616,"Radiation induced cardiovascular disease: An odyssey of bedside-bench-bedside approach The journey to Mars will be an ambitious, yet arduous task as it will entail culmination of all the information we have gathered over many decades. While the mission is of utmost importance, preservation of astronaut's well-being is paramount also. To that end, mitigation of radiation risk especially afflicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) is of great interest and challenge. Current data from astronauts on low earth orbit and Apollo missions provides insight on the risk of CVD from radiation exposure. However, data is limited given the small cohort size of astronauts who embarked on just nine prolonged missions. Therefore, a cerebral approach to understanding and mitigating risks are essential. This paper discusses the need for a predictive preclinical model to help understand and mitigate the effects of radiation on astronauts. We will discuss strengths and limitations of preclinical models and the methods of validating and constructing a model to predict human clinical outcomes. Our bedside-bench-bedside approach focuses on adapting the preclinical model through common investigative tools used between humans and animals. The result will be an optimization of preclinical model to a point of being a surrogate clinical model capable of predicting CVD outcomes in astronauts exposed to radiation.

2533,"Substantia nigra stimulation influences monkey superior colliculus neuronal activity bilaterally The inhibitory drive arising from the basal ganglia is thought to prevent the occurrence of orienting movements of the eyes, head, and body in monkeys and other mammals. The direct projection from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) to the superior colliculus (SC) mediates the inhibition. Since the original experiments in the SNr of monkeys the buildup or prelude neuron has been a focus of SC research. However, whether the SNr influences buildup neurons in SC is unknown. Furthermore, a contralateral SNr-SC pathway is evident in many species but remains unexplored in the alert monkey. Here we introduced electrical stimulation of one or both SNr nuclei while recording from SC buildup neurons. Stimulation of the SNr reduced the discharge rate of SC buildup neurons bilaterally. This result is consistent with activation of an inhibitory drive from SNr to SC. The time course of the influence of ipsilateral SNr on the activity of most SC neurons was longer (approximately 73 ms) than the influence of the contralateral SNr (approximately 34 ms). We also found that the variability of saccade onset time and saccade direction was altered with electrical stimulation of the SNr. Taken together our results show that electrical stimulation activates the inhibitory output of the SNr that in turn, reduces the activity of SC buildup neurons in both hemispheres. However, rather than acting as a gate for saccade initiation, the results suggest that the influence of SNr inhibition on visually guided saccades is more subtle, shaping the balance of excitation and inhibition across the SC.",Excluded
3440,"Cone beam computed tomography number errors and consequences for radiotherapy planning: An investigation of correction methods Purpose: The potential of keV cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) for guiding adaptive replanning is well-known. There are impediments to this, one being CBCT number accuracy. The purpose of this study was to investigate CBCT number correction methods and the affect of residual inaccuracies on dose deposition. Four different correction strategies were applied to the same patient data to compare performance and the sophistication of correction-method needed for acceptable dose errors. Methods and Materials: Planning CT and CBCT reconstructions were used for 12 patients (6 brain, 3 prostate, and 3 bladder cancer patients). All patients were treated using Elekta linear accelerators and XVI imaging systems. Two of the CBCT number correction methods investigated were based on an algorithm previously proposed by the authors but only previously applied to phantoms. Two further methods, based on an approach previously suggested in the research literature, were also examined. Dose calculations were performed using scans of a ""worst"" subset of patients using the Pinnacle<sup>3</sup> version 9.0 treatment planning system and the patients' clinical plans. Result(s): All mean errors in CBCT number were <50 HU, and all correction methods performed well or adequately in dose calculations. The worst single dose discrepancy identified for any of the examined methods or patients was 3.0%. Mean errors in the doses to treatment volumes or organs at risk were negatively correlated with the mean error in CT number. That is, a mean CT number that was too large, averaged over the entire CBCT volume, implied an underdosing in a volume-of-interest and vice versa. Conclusion(s): Results suggest that (1) the correction of CBCT numbers to within a mean error of 50 HU in the scan volume provides acceptable discrepancies in dose (<3%) and (2) this is achievable with even quite unsophisticated correction methods. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

3295,"Combined endoscopic endonasal surgery and fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (fSRS) for complex cranial base tumors-early clinical outcomes Endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) has been shown to be a feasible approach to cranial base tumors while reducing post-operative morbidity. Using the endoscopic endonasal approach alone or in combination with open approaches may provide advantages over conventional approaches. However, the balance between maximal resection and minimal injury to neurovascular structures frequently precludes gross total resection (GTR). Consequently, adjuvant radiation therapy may be an important option to improve local control (LC) of residual disease. In this retrospective series, we report clinical outcomes, morbidity, and LC of 40 patients with cranial base tumors treated with EES +/- combined open approach followed by fSRS (CyberKnife, Accuray Inc.). 26 patients had benign disease, 7 had newly diagnosed malignant disease, and 7 had previously resected malignant disease. Surgical outcomes were evaluable in all patients. LC after fSRS was evaluable in 39 patients and defined as no evidence of regrowth by MRI, CT, & physical examination. GTR was achieved in 12/40. Median post-operative length of stay (LOS) was 3 days. In multivariable analysis controlling for anatomic location and malignant histology, post-operative complications (n = 10) were significantly associated with patients having combined open and EES (p < 0.01, OR = 16.9). SRS was delivered in 1-5 sessions to a median marginal dose of 24.9 Gy. Median follow-up was 24.7 months (range, 1.5 to 61 months). LC was achieved in 89.7% (35/39) of evaluable patients. LC was achieved in 11/12 patients who had GTR. Median progression-free survival was 19.7 months (21.0 months for benign tumors (n = 26), 5.8 months for previously resected malignant disease (n = 7), and 21.2 months for newly diagnosed malignant disease (n = 7). Of the 31 patients who had symptomatic disease at presentation, 18 (58%) reported complete symptom resolution, 9 partial, and 4 no improvement. One patient who received two prior courses of radiation therapy developed osteosclerosis (grade III). Other adverse events were erythema (grade I, n = 5), nausea (grade II, n = 2), conjunctivitis (grade II, n = 1). EES followed by fSRS is a safe and effective management strategy for selected cranial base tumors. EES combined with an open surgical approach may result in increased complications. However, initial follow-up offers encouraging results indicating shorter time to recovery, acceptable LC rates compared to conventional approaches, and similar median time to progression for benign and newly diagnosed malignant disease.",Excluded
2620,"Extremely Low-Frequency Electromagnetic Fields Promote In Vitro Neuronal Differentiation and Neurite Outgrowth of Embryonic Neural Stem Cells via Up-Regulating TRPC1 Exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) can enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mice. However, little is focused on the effects of ELF-EMFs on embryonic neurogenesis. Here, we studied the potential effects of ELF-EMFs on embryonic neural stem cells (eNSCs). We exposed eNSCs to ELF-EMF (50 Hz, 1 mT) for 1, 2, and 3 days with 4 hours per day. We found that eNSC proliferation and maintenance were significantly enhanced after ELF-EMF exposure in proliferation medium. ELF-EMF exposure increased the ratio of differentiated neurons and promoted the neurite outgrowth of eNSC-derived neurons without influencing astrocyes differentiation and the cell apoptosis. In addition, the expression of the proneural genes, NeuroD and Ngn1, which are crucial for neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth, was increased after ELF-EMF exposure. Moreover, the expression of transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1) was significantly up-regulated accompanied by increased the peak amplitude of intracellular calcium level induced by ELF-EMF. Furthermore, silencing TRPC1 expression eliminated the up-regulation of the proneural genes and the promotion of neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth induced by ELF-EMF. These results suggest that ELF-EMF exposure promotes the neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth of eNSCs via up-regulation the expression of TRPC1 and proneural genes (NeuroD and Ngn1). These findings also provide new insights in understanding the effects of ELF-EMF exposure on embryonic brain development.",Excluded
2960,"Headache and sinus mass as presenting features of an aggressive nonfunctional pituitary adenoma Non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA) generally are treated surgically and with radiation (XRT) depending on their location and surrounding structures. Residual pituitary adenomas (PA) after treatment may exhibit growth with slow extension into surrounding structures which can take years to occur. Ectopic PA are rare and are mostly located in the sphenoid sinus. Predicting aggressive or malignant behavior in PA remains challenging. A 55-yo AA man with a PMH of a NFPA resected in 2001 and treated with gamma knife radiation to residual tissue, had anterior hypopituitarism, and presented to the ED with left sided headaches worsening over 4 days. Sinus CT scan revealed a new mass extending from the left maxillary sinus into the sella turcica. He had been followed by Endocrinology and Neurosurgery for his thus far stable residual tumor in the left sphenoid sinus as well as hormone requirements. His most recent MRI 2 y before his ED presentation showed the size of the residual tumor at that time being smaller than on prior MRIs. In the ED, neurosurgery colleagues evaluated him and recommended a biopsy of the sinus mass which was performed by Otolaryngology along with a left maxillary sinusotomy, anterior ethmoidectomy, and sphenoidotomy with tissue removal. The bx revealed a recurrence of the NFPA with tumor cells on pathology staining positive for Ki-67 (> 3%) and for p53, suggesting it was more aggressive. The patient's sx improved and he continued hormone replacement therapy with close f/u. This case illustrates the need for longterm follow-up of patients with NFPA, especially after treatment with any form of radiation (1). It further underscores the lack of biomarkers that could reliably assist in predicting which tumors are more likely to recur or become more aggressive including invasion (2). CT and MRI features of sphenoid sinus ectopic PA are well described (3,4). Misdiagnosis (such as olfactory neuroblastoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, paraganglioma, melanoma) of patients with a sinus mass and/or a history of PA should be avoided (5). Surgical removal of residual tumors remains the mainstay of therapy, if feasible. Nonsurgical therapy options are less standardized (1). PA that stain positive for Ki-67 or P53 are more likely to be aggressive than those that do not. Aggressive PA and pituitary carcinomas often require more novel treatments when traditional surgery and XRT fail (6,7).",Excluded

The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was completed twice, with a 1-yr interval. This questionnaire was also completed by an age- and sex-matched normative population (N = 580). Detailed data on treatment were extracted from the cancer registry and Population-based HAematological Registry for Observational Studies (PHAROS).RESULTS: Of the 181 patients who were invited, 148 responded (82%, T1). Patients treated with immunochemotherapy reported clinically relevant higher mean fatigue scores than those who underwent radiotherapy (P = 0.02). No differences were observed on the other HRQoL scales between treatment groups. Mean HRQoL scores were worse for FL patients treated with immunochemotherapy compared with a normative population (P < 0.01). A quarter to 50% of patients persistently reported to be slowed down, lethargic, or persistently worried about future health or was limited in social activities. Subsequently, patients reporting these symptoms/worries had a lower global health status/HRQoL.CONCLUSION: Alertness for persistent symptoms that occur during and after treatment of FL patients is needed and may help to avoid lasting negative influence on their HRQoL.",Excluded
2460,"Spatial distribution of brain microhemorrhage resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) Introduction Microhemorrhages, commonly found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of TBI, appear as punctuate hypointense foci on susceptibility weighted images (SWI). To better understand the spatial distribution of microhemorrhages, we map their locations to a normalized space and apply region of interest (ROI) analysis using brain atlases. Methods MRI was performed in a series of 46 sequential patients enrolled in a natural history study of TBI. Susceptibility weighted (TR = 64ms, TE = 25ms, FA = 20degree, 0.49 x 0.49 x 2.0 mm) and 3D T1-MPRAGE (TR = 25ms, TE = 3.03ms, FA = 7degree, 1 x 1 x 1 mm) images were acquired on a 3T Siemens Biograph mMR in all patients. SWI images were reviewed by a neuroradiologist on a Carestream PACS workstation, and microhemorrhages were labeled using the ""marker"" graphic tool. To characterize their spatial distribution in standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, the T1-MPRAGE was affine registered to the MNI template. This transformation was applied to the co-registered SWI images and to the marker coordinates. The frequency of microhemorrhages in major brain structures was determined from ROIs using the digital Talairach brain atlas. Similarly, the frequency of microhemorrhage in labeled white matter (WM) tracts was performed by applying the Diffusion Oriented Tract Segmentation method to the image within MNI space. Results A total of 629 microhemorrhages were identified. An average of 13 +/- 34 (range = 1 +/- 179) microhemorrhages were present in the 24 positive patients out of all 46 cases. Microhemorrhages congregated around the periphery of the brain and were symmetrically distributed. Using Talairach ROI analysis, microhemorrhages were most prevalent in the frontal lobes 60% (377). The remaining lobar distribution was temporal: 10% (63), parietal 1.3% (8), occipital: 4.7% (30), limbic: 3.6% (23). Sublobar distribution was brainstem: 1.4% (9), cerebellum: 4.8% (31), deep cerebral WM: 6.8% (43), thalamus and basal ganglia: 1.3% (8). Microhemorrhages in WM tracts contributed 61% (384) in total. Restricting the analysis to WM tracts, microhemorrhages were primarily found in the corpus callosum 40.3% (253). Other WM tracts with notable proportions ( > 4%) include the anterior thalamic radiation: 4.3% (27), cortico-pontine tract: 4.4% (28), inferior frontooccipital fasciculus: 13.4% (84), inferior longitudinal fasciculus: 5.5% (35), middle cerebellar peduncle 9.1% (57), superior fronto-occipital fasciculus 8% (50), and uncinate fasciculus 4.4% (28). We note, however, that because white matter tracts are relatively small structures and the alignment was performed using only an affine transformation, these results should be considered as preliminary. Conclusions This study examines the spatial distribution of microhemorrhages in 24 TBI patients. Microhemorrhages were distributed mostly around the periphery of the brain, and were particularly common in the frontal lobes. Such a finding is likely due to many of these injuries resulting from motor vehicle accidents, possibly with head-on collisions. In the WM tract analysis, the corpus callosum was implicated as a WM pathway that may be vulnerable to damage. Future work will expand the analysis to additional subjects, as well as examine distribution differences between impact and blast injuries. The relationship between microhemorrhage location and neurobehavioral symptoms requires further study.",Excluded
2967,"Fragments of ATM which have dominant-negative or complementing activity The ATM protein has been implicated in pathways controlling cell cycle checkpoints, radiosensitivity, genetic instability, and aging. Expression of ATM fragments containing a leucine zipper motif in a human tumor cell line abrogated the S-phase checkpoint after ionizing irradiation and enhanced radiosensitivity and chromosomal breakage. These fragments did not abrogate irradiation-induced G1 or G2 checkpoints, suggesting that cell cycle checkpoint defects alone cannot account for chromosomal instability in ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cells. Expression of the carboxy-terminal portion of ATM, which contains the PI-3 kinase domain, complemented radiosensitivity and the S-phase checkpoint and reduced chromosomal breakage after irradiation in AT cells. These observations suggest that ATM function is dependent on interactions with itself or other proteins through the leucine zipper region and that the PI-3 kinase domain contains much of the significant activity of ATM.",Excluded
3115,"Optimal timing and clinical value of radiotherapy in advanced ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer with or without baseline brain metastases: implications from pattern of failure analyses BACKGROUND: Despite development of several next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), crizotinib remains one of the first-line treatment options for advanced ALK-positive NSCLC and is widely used in situations where next-generation TKIs aren't yet approved or economically inaccessible. However, the pattern of failure and clinical value of radiotherapy in metastatic crizotinib-treated ALK-mutant lung cancer, with or without baseline brain metastases (BBM), are largely unknown.METHODS: Consecutive crizotinib-treated NSCLC patients with adequate imaging and measurable disease were retrospectively enrolled. Disease progression in original sites (primary/metastatic), new sites, or both, are classified as original failure (OF), distant failure (DF) and ODF, respectively. Progression free survival, from crizotinib initiation to the first disease progression, and from that to the second disease progression, were calculated as PFS1 and PFS2.RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were identified. With a median follow up of 22.0 (range, 2.0-72.0) months, 52 patients had crizotinib-treatment failure. The frequencies of OF, ODF, and DF, were 50.0, 26.9, and 23.1%, respectively. Histology, primary tumor size and presence of BBM, were independently associated with OF, using competing risks analyses. The brain was the most common site of initial disease progression. Patients with BBM had a significant higher possibility developing multiple-progressive lesions in the brain (p = 0.002). Importantly, four of the ten patients who had baseline oligo-metastatic cranial disease but didn't receive upfront brain radiation, developed multiple-progressive disease in the brain. Brain radiation before crizotinib could alter the disease failure patterns and improve PFS1 among patients with BBM (p = 0.006). Extracranial radiation was efficient in controlling symptoms but it was not associated with PFS1 (p = 0.223), and the majority of patients were eligible for salvage radiotherapy upon disease progression to crizotinib. By the time of data cut-off, 28 patients had second disease progression, with a median PFS2 of 7.0 (95% CI 5.4-8.6) months and salvage radiotherapy significantly prolonged PFS2 (p = 0.003). Additionally, patients receiving any radiotherapy during their treatment course had a significant longer overall survival (p = 0.048).CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with baseline oligo-metastatic brain lesions which are suitable for stereotactic radiosurgery, upfront brain radiotherapy provides considerable clinical benefits. While, extracranial radiation may be deferred in asymptomatic patients with multiple-metastatic lesions.",Excluded

Three hundred sixteen sites were treated. Ten sites were asymptomatic, including six hemibody fields with advanced disease unresponsive to chemotherapy and four local fields with impending pathological fractures. Three hundred six evaluable symptomatic sites remained. The most common symptom was bone pain. Other symptoms included neurological impairment and a palpable mass. Result(s): Total tumor dose ranged from 3.0 to 60 Gy, with a mean of 25 Gy. Symptom relief was obtained in 297 of 306 evaluable symptomatic sites (97%). Complete relief of symptoms was obtained in 26% and partial relief in 71%. Symptom relief was obtained in 92% of sites receiving a total dose less than 10 Gy (n = 13) and 98% of sites receiving 10 Gy or more (n = 293). No dose-response could be demonstrated. The likelihood of symptom relief was not influenced by the location of the lesion or the use of concurrent chemotherapy. Of the 297 responding sites, 6% (n = 19) relapsed after a median symptom-free interval of 16 months. Neither the probability of relapse nor the time to relapse was related to the radiation dose. Retreatment of relapsing sites provided effective palliation in all cases. Conclusion(s): Radiation therapy is effective in palliating local symptoms in multiple myeloma. A total dose of 10 Gy should provide durable symptom relief in the majority of patients.",Excluded
2516,"Brain irradiation-induced lymphocytosis predicts response in cancer patients with brain metastases Lymphocytopenia is one of the main toxicities of radiotherapy and its severity is related to the irradiation dose. The occurrence of lymphocytopenia depends on the body site of radiotherapy; it is most pronounced with pelvic irradiation, whereas the effect of brain irradiation on the lymphocyte count is to be elucidated. This preliminary study was performed to evaluate changes in lymphocyte number occurring during brain irradiation in cancer patients with brain metastases. The study included 50 patients who received brain radiotherapy for single or multiple brain metastases at a total dose of 30 Gy. Overall, no significant changes in mean lymphocyte number occurred during brain radiotherapy. However, when lymphocyte variations were assessed in relation to the clinical response of brain metastases, a significant increase in the mean number of lymphocytes was found in patients who achieved objective regression of brain metastases on brain irradiation. The mean lymphocyte number decreased in nonresponding patients, albeit without a statistically significant difference with respect to the pretreatment values. The results of this study show that the efficacy of radiotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases is associated with a significant increase in mean lymphocyte number. Therefore, evidence of brain irradiation-induced lymphocytosis may predict the efficacy of radiotherapy.",Excluded

Cytoreduction and PDT have postulated to afford better local GBM-control. However, the interaction of PDT with newer novel therapies had not been fully investigated. This study reviewed the impact of PDT in conjunction with intraoperative radiotherapy.METHODS: Case note review of prospectively collected data of GBMs treated surgically by the senior author (SE). Patients received standard therapy (ST), ST+PDT or ST+PDT+IORT. ST involved maximum safe resection, PDT involved intracavity 100 J/cm2 630 nm laser and IORT involved intracavity 10-15 Gys using the PRS400 R. Patients were followed up clinically and radiologically till death.RESULTS: There were 73 patients included in this analysis (42 males). The average age was 59years. Thirty received PDT and 43 did not. The mean survival of PDT-patients was significantly longer than those had ST alone (62.9 weeks vs. 20.6 weeks) (p=0.001). Patients < 65 year of age survived longer than those >= 65 year (p=0.033). IORT on its own did not make a significant difference to survival (p=0.111). However the average survival for patients who received PDT+IORT was substantially higher than those who received PDT alone (79 weeks vs. 39.7 weeks). Using a Cox regression covariant analysis, demonstrated that PDT was the only therapy to make a statistically significant difference to survival (p=0.018).CONCLUSIONS: PDT in high grade glioma was statistically significant therapeutic modality and its effects were further improved by IORT.",Excluded
3164,"Preliminary Results of Emergency Computed Tomography-Guided Ventricular Drain Placement-Precision for the Most Difficult Cases Background: External ventricular drainage (EVD) catheter placement is one of the most commonly performed neurosurgical procedures. The study's objective was to compare a computed tomography (CT) bolt scan-guided approach for the placement of EVDs with conventional landmark-based insertion. Method(s): In this retrospective case-control study, we analyzed patients undergoing bolt-kit EVD catheter placement, either CT-guided or landmark-based, between 2013 and 2016. The CT bolt scan-guided approach was based on a dose-reduced CT scan after bolt fixation with immediate image reconstruction along the axis of the bolt to evaluate the putative insertion axis. If needed, angulation of the bolt was corrected and the procedure repeated before the catheter was inserted. Primary endpoint was the accuracy of insertion. Secondary endpoints were the overall number of attempts, duration of intervention, complication rates, and cumulative radiation dose. Result(s): In total, 34 patients were included in the final analysis. In the group undergoing CT-guided placement, the average ventricle width was significantly smaller (P = 0.04) and average midline shift significantly more pronounced (P = 0.01). CT-guided placement resulted in correct positioning of the catheter in the ipsilateral frontal horn in all 100% of the cases compared with landmark-guided insertion (63%; P = 0.01). Application of the CT-guided approach increased the number of total CT scans (3.6 +/- 1.9) and the overall radiation dose (3.34 +/- 1.61 mSv) compared with the freehand insertion group (1.84 +/- 2.0 mSv and 1.55 +/- 1.66 mSv). No differences were found for the other secondary outcome parameters. Conclusion(s): CT-guided bolt-kit EVD catheter placement is feasible and accurate in the most difficult cases.

2471,"General anaesthesia for advanced cancer patients treated with combined surgery and intraoperative precision radiation therapy Intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IORT) is widely considered to have great potential for cancer treatment. The world's first mobile electron linear accelerator (Mobetron) has changed the way cancer patients are treated.1 This study is designed to test the anaesthetic management of patients receiving a combination of extensive surgery and intraoperative radiation using the Mobetron combined with remote monitoring. Safety and effectiveness of the Mobetron will also be assessed. Our initial study was to analyse the difference between patients who underwent surgery with and without IORT using the Mobetron. A further study was designed to assess neutron leakage measurements around the target tumour bed with a semi-conducting electrode. Twenty-four patients with locally advanced primary or locally recurrent cancer were recruited into this prospective study and were randomly assigned into the Mobetron group (n=12) and the control group (n=12). General anaesthesia was delivered during surgery. Narcotrend measurements for depth of anaesthesia and noxious stimulation were made. Radiation was delivered directly to the tumour bed or target section with the use of the Mobetron immediately after surgey (resection/laparotomy). The dose rate around the target tumour bed or target section was assessed with a semi-conducting electrode. During the 2 min of intraoperative radiation therapy, patients and monitors were observed via closed-circuit camera.2 No serious complications related to anaesthesia (cardiac failure, respiratory failure, renal failure, and cerebral dysfunction) occurred. The level of anaesthesia, recovery time, intraoperative haemorrhage, blood transfusion, urinary output, crystalloid and colloid infusion, lowest temperature, SpO2 (%), E'CO<inf>2</inf>, were similar in two groups. The addition of radiotherapy extends the total time of anaesthesia by 20-30 min. The dose rate at the region around target is much lower than the target (0.11 Gy min<sup>-1</sup> vs 1.17 Gy min<sup>-1</sup>). The majority of patients were stable (haemodynamic and respiratory) enough to be discharged from the ICU to the ward within 3 days. Adequate preoperative assessment and preparation, reasonable anaesthesia management with the help of adequate remote monitoring, and effective multidisciplinary (Table Presented) communication all contribute to make IORT procedures feasible and safe. IORT has allowed a selective treatment approach to locally advanced primary and recurrent neoplasm which traditionally would have been deemed unresectable. Mobetron for IORT is a safe, reliable, and easy-to-master technique without any obvious side-effect. Stray radiation from the Mobetron is so low that no additional shielding in the operating theatre is required.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: Between March 2016 and September 2018, 20 patients with brain metastases underwent WBRT using the four-field box technique. WBRT is performed with a dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions daily. Two computed tomography simulations per person were performed. One was in the traditional supine position for B-WBRT and the other by applying the tilting acrylic supine baseplate to elevate the head by 40degree for FB-WBRT. The B-WBRT used the field-in-field technique, which is the most commonly used method in our institution. The FB-WBRT comprised anterior, posterior, and bilateral beams. A wedge was applied in anterior and posterior fields to compensate for skull convexity. Result(s): The average of Dmean of both parotid glands was 10.2 Gy (range, 3.8 to 17.8 Gy) in B-WBRT and 5.4 Gy (range, 2.0 to 11.7 Gy) in FB-WBRT (p < 0.05). Compared to B-WBRT, FB-WBRT reduced the mean dose of the right and left parotid glands from 10.1 Gy to 4.9 Gy and from 10.4 Gy to 5.8 Gy, respectively (p < 0.05). Further, V<inf>5</inf>, V<inf>10</inf>, V<inf>15</inf>, V<inf>20</inf>, and V<inf>25</inf> for the parotid gland decreased significantly in FB-WBRT (p < 0.05). The Dmax and Dmean of lens decreased according to the dose-volume histogram. Conclusion(s): Compared to B-WBRT, FB-WBRT with a tilting baseplate is a simple and effective method that takes feature of non-coplanar beam to protect the parotid gland. Copyright © 2019.

3112,"Cognitive features 10 or more years after successful breast cancer survival: comparisons across types of cancer interventions BACKGROUND: The present study examined the long-term cognitive implications of cancer treatment among breast cancer survivors aged 65 years and older to better understand the long term implications of cancer treatment.METHODS: Fifty-seven women survivors were compared with 30 healthy older female adult comparisons, matched in terms of age and education, with no history of cancer. Cancer survivors were also compared on the basis of treatment intervention, involving chemotherapy (n = 27) versus local therapy through surgery and radiation (n = 30).RESULTS: As a group, the breast cancer survivors scored lower on measures of general cognitive function, working memory, psychomotor speed, and executive function when compared with the normal comparisons. Among the cancer survivors, those who received local therapy scored lower than the other survivors and normal comparisons on measures of verbal learning, visual perception and construction, as well as visual attention and short-term retention.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that cognitive outcomes may involve greater age-related deficits among older cancer survivors compared with matched healthy subjects.",Included
3471,"Novel risk stratification score for predicting early distant brain failure and salvage whole-brain radiotherapy after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to evaluate predictors of early distant brain failure (DBF) and salvage whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) after treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases and create a clinically relevant risk score to stratify patients' risk for these events. METHODS The records of 270 patients with brain metastases who were treated with SRS between 2003 and 2012 were reviewed. Pretreatment patient and tumor characteristics were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses. The cumulative incidences of first DBF and salvage WBRT were calculated. Significant factors were used to create a score for stratifying early (6-month) DBF risk. RESULTS No prior WBRT, a total lesion volume < 1.3 cm<sup>3</sup>, primary breast cancer or malignant melanoma histology, and multiple metastases (>=2) were found to be significant predictors of early DBF. Each factor was ascribed 1 point because of similar hazard ratios. Scores of 0 to 1, 2, and 3 to 4 were considered to indicate low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively. This correlated with 6-month cumulative incidences of DBF of 16.6%, 28.8%, and 54.4%, respectively (P < .001). For patients without prior WBRT, the 6-month cumulative incidence of salvage WBRT was 2%, 17.7%, and 25.7%, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Early DBF after SRS requiring salvage WBRT remains a significant clinical problem. Patient stratification for early DBF can better inform the decision for the initial treatment strategy for brain metastases. The provided risk score may help to predict early DBF and subsequent salvage WBRT if SRS is initially used. External validation is needed before clinical implementation. Cancer 2015;121:3836-3843.

2415,"Circular collimator arc versus dynamic conformal arc treatment planning for linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery of an intracranial small single lesion: a perspective of lesion asymmetry BACKGROUND: Although circular collimator arcs (CCA) and dynamic conformal arcs (DCA) are commonly used linear accelerator-based treatment planning techniques for intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of a small single lesion, these two techniques have not been rigorously compared in terms of tumor shape. Therefore, this study compared clinical CCA plans with re-planned DCA plans using conformity index (CI) and V12Gy (volume of normal brain tissue receiving 12 Gy or higher) from a perspective of asymmetry (Asym) of planning target volume (PTV).METHODS: Ninety-five clinical CCA plans delivered for a small single lesion with PTV size < 1.4 cm<sup>3</sup> were selected and re-planned using DCA. PTV Asym (%) was defined and calculated from three dimensions of PTV. A pair of the 95 plans was first considered as one group without grouping and then categorized into two groups with respective to either PTV size or PTV Asym, and four groups with respect to PTV size and PTV Asym. For grouping, median values of PTV size and PTV Asym were used. A non-parametric paired test was performed for CI and V12Gy to compare CCA and DCA plans in each group.RESULTS: Median values of PTV size and PTV Asym were 0.415 cm<sup>3</sup> (range: 0.076 cm<sup>3</sup>-1.369 cm<sup>3</sup>) and 6.12% (range: 0.52-25.74%), respectively. DCA plans had a lower average CI value than CCA plans for all groups. CCA plans had a smaller average V12Gy value than DCA plans for lesions with PTV Asym <=6.12%, while CCA and DCA plans had similar average V12Gy values for lesions with PTV Asym > 6.12%.CONCLUSIONS: The DCA technique is recommended when a lesion has PTV Asym > 6.12% regardless of PTV size. For lesions with PTV Asym <=6.12%, a technique choice would depend on the preference of CI or V12Gy.",Excluded

One hundred thirty-four Caucasian men and 105 African-American men were assigned randomly to one of two approaches to delivering the intervention or to the control condition. Men entered the study immediately after surgical treatment or in the first 3 weeks of radiation therapy. Trained nurses delivered the intervention through weekly phone calls for 8 weeks.RESULTS: The authors found that the majority of intervention effects were from baseline to 4 months postbaseline, when treatment side effects are most intense. Both Caucasian men and African-American men who received either one of the two approaches for delivering the intervention improved in the two uncertainty management methods of cognitive reframing and problem solving. Similarly, when the intervention groups were combined, men who received the intervention also improved significantly in control of incontinence by 4 months postbaseline. Decreases in the number of treatment side effects differed by time and treatment/ ethnic group interactions as did satisfaction with sexual functioning.CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first tests of a psychoeducational intervention among men with prostate carcinoma and was the first test that included a sufficient number of African-American men to test by ethnic group.

Positive brain scans were found in ischemic cerebral infarction in 68% of the cases; with a relatively low rate in the early phase from the onset of the illness showing a peak of positive scans in 2 to 4 wk with a gradual decline. Even those with a positive scan turned negative after 8 wk. A definite correlation between the clinical severity and positive scan was found. In cases with cortical involvement positive brain scan was observed in high frequency. Single brain scan yielded only a value of screening procedure but follow-up examinations in the course of illness proved to be rather important for the differential diagnosis of underlying pathology and further for fortelling the prognosis. In view of the prognosis of motor functions those with an intense uptake of radioisotope, a relatively large sized and persistent abnormality were likely left with severe neurological deficit while in cases who showed a mild and transient positive scan the recovery of motor functions were favorable. When rate of positive scan for the respective territory of cerebral vessels were evaluated, positive scans were most frequently observed in the vicinity of middle cerebral artery. The frequency of positive scans in the territory of posterior cerebral artery and vertebro-basilar artery were found lowest. Brain scanning was found most suitable for the diagnosis of cerebral hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformations, subdural hematoma and SLE vasculitis but it exhibited merely low rate of posivity in cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage and transient ischemic attack.

3124,"Growth factor gene-modified mesenchymal stem cells in tissue regeneration There have been marked changes in the field of stem cell therapeutics in recent years, with many clinical trials having been conducted to date in an effort to treat myriad diseases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the cell type most frequently utilized in stem cell therapeutic and tissue regenerative strategies, and have been used with excellent safety to date. Unfortunately, these MSCs have limited ability to engraft and survive, reducing their clinical utility. MSCs are able to secrete growth factors that can support the regeneration of tissues, and engineering MSCs to express such growth factors can improve their survival, proliferation, differentiation, and tissue reconstructing abilities. As such, it is likely that such genetically modified MSCs may represent the next stage of regenerative therapy. Indeed, increasing volumes of preclinical research suggests that such modified MSCs expressing growth factors can effectively treat many forms of tissue damage.

3650,"Hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroinflammation after cranial irradiation with (56)Fe particles Exposure to heavy-ion radiation is considered a potential health risk in long-term space travel. In the central nervous system (CNS), loss of critical cellular components may lead to performance decrements that could ultimately compromise mission goals and long-term quality of life. Hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairments occur after exposure to ionizing radiation, and while the pathogenesis of this effect is not yet clear, it may involve the production of newly born neurons (neurogenesis) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We irradiated mice with 0.5-4 Gy of (56)Fe ions and 2 months later quantified neurogenesis and numbers of activated microglia as a measure of neuroinflammation in the dentate gyrus. Results showed that there were few changes after 0.5 Gy, but that there was a dose-related decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis and a dose-related increase in numbers of newly born activated microglia from 0.5-4.0 Gy. While those findings were similar to what was reported after X irradiation, there were also some differences, particularly in the response of newly born glia. Overall, this study showed that hippocampal neurogenesis was sensitive to relatively low doses of (56)Fe particles, and that those effects were associated with neuroinflammation.

Five healthy volunteers underwent whole-body combined PET-computed tomography 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 hours after tracer injection (mean dose, 9.5 mCi +/- 3.4 [standard deviation] [351.5 MBq +/- 125.8]; mean specific radioactivity, 1200 mCi/mmol +/- 714 [44.4 GBq/mmol +/- 26.4]). During this time, standard vital signs, electrocardiographic (ECG) readings, and blood sample values (for chemistry, hematologic, and liver function tests) were checked at regular intervals and 1 and 7 days after the injection. These data were used to evaluate tracer biodistribution and dosimetric properties, time-activity curves, and the stability of laboratory values. Significant changes in vital signs and laboratory values were evaluated by using a combination of population-averaged generalized estimating equation regression and exact paired Wilcoxon tests.RESULTS: The administration of (18)F-FPPRGD2 was well tolerated, with no marked effects on vital signs, ECG readings, or laboratory values. The tracer showed the same pattern of biodistribution in all volunteers: primary clearance through the kidneys (0.360 rem/mCi +/- 0.185 [0.098 mSv/MBq +/- 0.050]) and bladder (0.862 rem/mCi +/- 0.436 [0.233 mSv/MBq +/- 0.118], voiding model) and uptake in the spleen (0.250 rem/mCi +/- 0.168 [0.068 mSv/MBq +/- 0.046]) and large intestine (0.529 rem/mCi +/- 0.236 [0.143 mSv/MBq +/- 0.064]). The mean effective dose of (18)F-FPPRGD2 was 0.1462 rem/mCi +/- 0.0669 (0.0396 mSv/MBq +/- 0.0181). With an injected dose of 10 mCi (370 MBq) and a 1-hour voiding interval, a patient would be exposed to an effective radiation dose of 1.5 rem (15 mSv). Above the diaphragm, there was minimal uptake in the brain ventricles, salivary glands, and thyroid gland. Time-activity curves showed rapid clearance from the vasculature, with a mean 26% +/- 17 of the tracer remaining in the circulation at 30 minutes and most of the activity occurring in the plasma relative to cells (mean whole blood-plasma ratio, 0.799 +/- 0.096).CONCLUSION: (18)F-FPPRGD2 has desirable pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties. The primary application is likely to be PET evaluation of oncologic patients-especially those with brain, breast, or lung cancer. Specific indications may include tumor staging, identifying patients who would benefit from antiangiogenesis therapy, and separating treatment responders from nonresponders early.",Excluded
2867,"Early neural grafts transiently reduce the behavioral effects of radiation-induced fascia dentata granule cell hypoplasia X-irradiation of the neonatal rat hippocampus produces a selective hypoplasia of fascia dentata granule cells, locomotor hyperactivity, perseverative movements and deficits in passive avoidance. We previously reported that transplantation of fetal hippocampal tissue into the adult (age = 182 +/- 4 days) brain produced a partial recovery of these behavioral deficits. Since graft/host interconnections are more prominent when transplants are conducted soon after radiation-induced hippocampal damage, in this study we transplanted hippocampal or cerebral cortex neurons when host rats were 33 +/- 5 days of age (i.e. only 16 days after radiogenic brain damage). Behavioral evaluations were conducted 80 and 182 days after transplantation or surgical control procedures. In the first test series only, selective components of locomotion (e.g. stereotypy and total distance traveled) and perseverative turning (e.g. mean bout length and turning speed topography) were normalized by the hippocampal grafts. Radiation-induced changes in passive avoidance were less prominent in these studies than in past experiments. Still, transplantation of hippocampal tissue improved performance on this learning task as well. Cerebral cortex grafts did not produce reliable improvements in most behavioral measures. These data suggest that hippocampal grafts placed soon after X-ray induced fascia dentata hypoplasia reduce a broad range of behavioral deficits. However, these benefits are transient and, for the most part, depend on the use of transplant tissues homologous with those damaged.",Excluded
2612,"Loss of Pde6 reduces cell body Ca(2+) transients within photoreceptors Modulation of Ca(2+) within cells is tightly regulated through complex and dynamic interactions between the plasma membrane and internal compartments. In this study, we exploit in vivo imaging strategies based on genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicators to define changes in perikaryal Ca(2+) concentration of intact photoreceptors. We developed double-transgenic zebrafish larvae expressing GCaMP3 in all cones and tdTomato in long-wavelength cones to test the hypothesis that photoreceptor degeneration induced by mutations in the phosphodiesterase-6 (Pde6) gene is driven by excessive [Ca(2+)]i levels within the cell body. Arguing against Ca(2+) overload in Pde6 mutant photoreceptors, simultaneous analysis of cone photoreceptor morphology and Ca(2+) fluxes revealed that degeneration of pde6c(w59) mutant cones, which lack the cone-specific cGMP phosphodiesterase, is not associated with sustained increases in perikaryal [Ca(2+)]i. Analysis of [Ca(2+)]i in dissociated Pde6beta(rd1)mouse rods shows conservation of this finding across vertebrates. In vivo, transient and Pde6-independent Ca(2+) elevations ('flashes') were detected throughout the inner segment and the synapse. As the mutant cells proceeded to degenerate, these Ca(2+) fluxes diminished. This study thus provides insight into Ca(2+) dynamics in a common form of inherited blindness and uncovers a dramatic, light-independent modulation of [Ca(2+)]i that occurs in normal cones.",Excluded

The action of three neurosteroids was tested against cortical epileptic afterdischarges in immature rats with implanted electrodes. Afterdischarges (ADs) were elicited by rhythmic electrical stimulation (biphasic pulses at 8 Hz frequency for 15s) of sensorimotor cortical region with a slightly suprathreshold current intensity. Drugs were administered intraperitoneally after the first afterdischarge and stimulation was repeated five more times with the same intensity. Allopregnanolone in doses of 20 and 30 mg/kg i.p. was found to be active in 12-day-old rats; there was no effect in 18-day-old rats and only a tendency in 25-day-old ones. Therefore, the effects of pregnanolone and a new derivative THDOC-conjugate (20 and 40 mg/kg) were compared with those of allopregnanolone (40 mg/kg) only in 12- and 25-day-old rats in the second part of study. All three neurosteroids blocked progressive prolongation of repeated ADs seen in control 12-day-old rats. In addition, pregnanolone was able to shorten the ADs. In contrast, duration of ADs in 25-day-old animals was significantly shorter than the duration of the first, predrug AD only after administration of the 40 mg/kg dose of pregnanolone; if corresponding ADs in the control and drug groups were compared, pregnanolone and THDOC-conjugate led to significantly shorter ADs, changes after allopregnanolone administration were statistically significant only in the fourth AD. None of the studied neurosteroids was able to suppress movements directly bound to stimulation as well as clonic seizures accompanying afterdischarges. Among the three drugs studied, pregnanolone was found to be the most potent one. As developmental changes are concerned, the youngest animals exhibited the highest sensitivity to anticonvulsant action of neurosteroids.",Excluded

3218,"Radiation dose to otologic structures during head and neck cancer radiation therapy BACKGROUND: Otologic structures are often contained within head and neck cancer radiation treatment ports. The dosimetry to otologic structures has not been routinely analyzed and radiation treatment planning does not currently attempt to specifically avoid the inner ear structures when dosimetry is calculated. Recent studies demonstrate that up to 30% of patients experience sensorineural hearing loss on multimodality therapy with cisplatin and radiation.METHODS: In the current case series, radiation dosimetry to otologic structures was calculated from computed tomogram treatment plans on patients. Fifteen nasopharyngeal, oral cavity, oropharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal cancer patients were analyzed.RESULTS: Between 8% and 102% of the total dose is delivered to the petrous bone/cochlea, with 4 of 15 patients getting more than 50% of the dose to at least one cochlea The mastoid air cells received between 3% and 75% of the total dose, with higher doses being delivered to patients with bulky high neck metastases or nasopharyngeal tumors. The eustachian tubes received between 20% and 102% of the total dose, with 10 of 15 patients receiving more than 50% of the dose to this anatomic site.CONCLUSION: We conclude that the cochlea and eustachian tubes receive significant radiation during treatment, particularly in nasopharyngeal cancer patients.

A single institution, prospective, randomized trial was performed in terminal cancer patients to compare tropisetron (TRO), metoclopramide (MET), and chlorpromazine (CHL) in the management of nausea and emesis. Patients had far advanced cancer, were far removed from chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and their nausea and emesis was not due to bowel obstruction, drug intake, or cranial, electrolytic, or metabolic causes. The effects of antiemetic treatments were evaluated from Days 1-15. METHODS. Two hundred and eighty patients were randomized to receive 1) MET+ dexamethasone (DEX) (10 mg*4 and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 2) TRO (5 mg*l, orally), 3) TRO + MET (5 mg*l and 10 mg*2, respectively, orally), 4) TRO + MET + DEX (5 mg*l, 10 mg*2, and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 5) CHL + DEX (25 mg*2 and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 6) TRO + CHL (5 mg*l and 12.5 mg*2, respectively, orally), or 7) TRO + CHL + DEX (5 mg*l, 12.5 mg*2, and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally). Total control was defined as no nausea or emesis. RESULTS. By the end of the 15th day, total control of emesis was obtained in 23.6% (9 of 38) of MET + DEX patients, 78.9% (30 of 38) of TRO patients, 84.2% (32 of 38) of TRO + MET patients, 92.3% (36 of 39) of TRO + MET + DEX patients, 33.3 (13 of 39) of CHL + DEX patients, 84.6% (33 of 39) of TRO + CHL patients, and 92.5% (37 of 40) of TRO + CHL + DEX patients. Total control of nausea was achieved in 18.4% (7 of 38) of MET + DEX patients, 65.7% (25 of 38) of TRO patients, 73.6% (28 of 38) of TRO + MET patients, 87.1% (34 of 39) of TRO + MET + DEX patients, 17.9% (7 of 39) of CHL + DEX patients, 74.3% (29 of 39) of TRO + CHL patients, and 85% (34 of 40) of TRO + CHL + DEX patients. When comparing MET + DEX versus TRO; MET + DEX versus TRO + MET; MET + DEX versus TRO + MET + DEX; MET + DEX versus TRO + CHL; MET + DEX versus TRO + CHL + DEX; CHL + DEX versus TRO; CHL + DEX versus TRO + MET; CHL + DEX versus TRO + MET + DEX; CHL + DEX versus TRO + CHL; and CHL + DEX versus TRO + CHL + DEX, significant differences were noted. All antiemetic drugs were well tolerated with no severe side effects observed in any treatment arm. C0NCLUSIONS. These data suggest that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as tropisetron clinically are more effective in the control of emesis of patients with far advanced cancer than previously used agents.

Recently functional imaging studies provide evidence for direct participation of basal temporal and occipital cortices in the cognitive process of reading. The exact location and function of these areas remain a matter of debate.OBJECTIVE: To confirm the participation of the basal temporal region in reading.METHOD: Extraoperative electrical stimulation of the dominant hemisphere was performed in three subjects using subdural electrodes, as part of presurgical evaluation for refractory epilepsy.RESULTS: Pure alexia was reproduced during cortical stimulation of the dominant posterior fusiform and inferior temporal gyri in all three patients. Stimulation resulted in selective reading difficulty with intact auditory comprehension and writing. Reading difficulty involved sentences and words with intact letter by letter reading. Picture naming difficulties were also noted at some electrodes. This region is located posterior to and contiguous with the basal temporal language area (BTLA) where stimulation resulted in global language dysfunction in visual and auditory realms. The location corresponded with the visual word form area described on functional MRI.CONCLUSION: These observations support the existence of a visual language area in the dominant fusiform and occipitotemporal gyri, contiguous with basal temporal language area.

The purpose of this study was to compare different brain radiotherapy treatments on SCLC patients with brain metastases.METHODS: In this multi-center retrospective study, SCLC patients who had undergone whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases from January 2012 to December 2018 were retrospectively screened.RESULTS: A total of 263 eligible SCLC patients were included in this study, among whom, 73 were women and 190 were men. According to accepted brain radiotherapy, the remaining patients were divided into WBRT plus focal radiation boost (WBRT+boost), WBRT, and SRS groups. In pairwise comparisons of the overall survival (OS), WBRT+boost group led to longer survival than did WBRT both in all patients (17.9 vs 8.7 months; P < 0.001) and 140 matched patients (17.9 vs 11.7 months; P = 0.045). There were no significant differences in OS between WBRT+boost and SRS groups in all patients (17.9 vs 14.5 months; P = 0.432). Among 74 matched patients between WBRT+boost and SRS groups, however, patients who received WBRT+boost led to a longer survival than did SRS alone (21.8 vs 12.9 months; P = 0.040). In pairwise comparison of the intracranial progression-free survival time (iPFS), WBRT+boost group also showed survival advantages over WBRT (10.8 vs 6.5 months; P = 0.005) and SRS groups (10.8 vs 7.5 months; P = 0.032).CONCLUSION: Due to the SCLC-derived multiple brain metastases and better survival time, focal radiation boost combined with adjuvant WBRT may be a preferred strategy for SCLC patients with brain metastases.",Excluded
2861,"Role and relevance of neurocognitive assessment in clinical trials of patients with CNS tumors The inclusion of neurocognitive end points in clinical trials of patients with CNS tumors is increasing. Neurocognitive end points are used to understand what cognitive problems exist before treatment to establish a baseline by which the effect of treatment is judged, and to determine whether different treatment regimens improve neurocognitive function due to better tumor control, slow expected neurocognitive deterioration due to the tumor, or have more or less short- and long-term neurotoxicity. However, the use of neurocognitive end points in clinical trials for patients with CNS tumors is in its infancy, so that long-term outcomes are difficult to predict and the ability to determine the effects of different agents and treatment approaches is scant.

2639,"New concept of a submillimetric pixellated Silicon detector for in vivo brain studies in freely moving rodents In neuroscience, well established techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI and positron-emission tomography (PET) suffer from technical limitations for the in vivo investigation of brain processes in rodents, such as low sensitivity and the need of animal restraining during image acquisition. To address the lack of adapted neuroimaging methods for awake and freely moving animals a miniature portable PET scanner directly held by the rat head has been developed recently allowing for some freedom of the rat movements when operated together with a mobility system. However, the remaining weight of such bulk apparatus may still impair the animal movements. In order to preserve the animal from any impediment to their motion activity during behavioral analysis, we propose a novel fully autonomous setup with a miniaturized beta+ radiosensitive microprobe implantable in rodent brain. The detector will permit high sensitivity local time activity measurements of radiotracers in a volume of a few mm3 while drastically limiting stress induced in the animals during acquisition. The principal architecture of the measurement setup is based on two mechanically independent parts. The first part is the head socket (Figure 1: A), it carries a pixellated 1700 mum long Silicon needle with its sensitive part implanted into the brain by stereotaxic surgery and a specific ASIC for the parallel signal processing of each pixel. It is fixed on the skull and connected via a cable to the second part, a back-board (Figure 1: B) that can be worn by the animal. This part supports the components required to drive the ASIC, those used to deliver a radio-frequency telemetric signal to the acquisition board on a PC and the power supply. The assembly is sufficiently light and small to prevent any interference with the motions of the animal during the experiments. To design the sensor, Monte-Carlo simulations have been carried out, which showed that 200 mum thick high resistivity Silicon pixels with an area of 200 mum x 500 mum are optimized in terms of beta+ sensitivity versus relative transparency to the gamma background. Several probe geometries have been investigated with simulations using technology computer-assisted design (TCAD) to determine a specific pattern of guard rings enhancing the electronic stabilization of the sensor and ensuring the electrical isolation of the pixels. Finally, two designs with two and three guard rings (total probe width of 690 and 800 mum) were implemented and the prototypes have been proved to be stable and fully operational in probe station analysis. Despite its mechanical fragility, even the only 690 mum wide, less invasive prototype showed sufficient stability for implantation in brain tissue. The physical characterization of both geometries was carried out with dedicated radioactive sources and ratio-tracer solutions. Their beta detection efficiency, their transparency to gamma rays as well as the influence of environmental parameters were determined and results compared to Monte- Carlo simulations reproducing exact probe geometries and experimental setup.

3354,"Radio frequency radiation-related cancer: assessing causation in the occupational/military setting BACKGROUND AND AIM: We reexamine whether radio frequency radiation (RFR) in the occupational and military settings is a human carcinogen.METHODS: We extended an analysis of an already-reported case series of patients with cancer previously exposed to whole-body prolonged RFR, mainly from communication equipment and radar. We focused on hematolymphatic (HL) cancers. We used analysis by percentage frequency (PF) of a cancer type, which is the proportion of a specific cancer type relative to the total number of cancer cases. We also examined and analyzed the published data on three other cohort studies from similar military settings from different countries.RESULTS: The PF of HL cancers in the case series was very high, at 40% with only 23% expected for the series age and gender profile, confidence interval CI95%: 26-56%, p<0.01, 19 out of 47 patients had HL cancers. We also found high PF for multiple primaries. As for the three other cohort studies: In the Polish military sector, the PF of HL cancers was 36% in the exposed population as compared to 12% in the unexposed population, p<0.001. In a small group of employees exposed to RFR in Israeli defense industry, the PF of HL cancers was 60% versus 17% expected for the group age and gender profile, p<0.05. In Belgian radar battalions the HL PF was 8.3% versus 1.4% in the control battalions as shown in a causes of deaths study and HL cancer mortality rate ratio was 7.2 and statistically significant. Similar findings were reported on radio amateurs and Korean war technicians. Elevated risk ratios were previously reported in most of the above studies.CONCLUSIONS: The consistent association of RFR and highly elevated HL cancer risk in the four groups spread over three countries, operating different RFR equipment types and analyzed by different research protocols, suggests a cause-effect relationship between RFR and HL cancers in military/occupational settings. While complete measurements of RFR exposures were not available and rough exposure assessments from patients interviews and from partial exposure data were used instead, we have demonstrated increased HL cancers in occupational groups with relatively high RFR exposures. Our findings, combined with other studies, indicate that exposures incurred in the military settings evaluated here significantly increased the risk of HL cancers. Accordingly, the RFR military exposures in these occupations should be substantially reduced and further efforts should be undertaken to monitor and measure those exposures and to follow cohorts exposed to RFR for cancers and other health effects. Overall, the epidemiological studies on excess risk for HL and other cancers together with brain tumors in cellphone users and experimental studies on RFR and carcinogenicity make a coherent case for a cause-effect relationship and classifying RFR exposure as a human carcinogen (IARC group 1).",Excluded

The occurrence of extramedullary disease in multiple myeloma is less common. We report a case of multiple myeloma which presented as Pancoast syndrome due to extramedullary dissemination to lung. Case report: A 76-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with worsening of right shoulder pain for 2 days. He gave a 6 month history of sharp, persistent, right shoulder pain, radiating to medial aspect of arm and forearm associated with numbness and tingling. He subsequently underwent carpal tunnel release and ulnar nerve reposition surgeries. Examination revealed a hard, non mobile mass in the right supraclavicular fossa. Chest radiograph revealed a soft tissue density in the right lung apex and an extrapulmonary mass along the right lower chest wall (Image 1a). CT chest (Image 1b) and MRI spine (Image 1c) revealed multiple masses adjacent to the pleura on the right side and a large right apical lung mass involving the supraclavicular fossa, right posterior cervical space, prevertebral musculature with osseous and epidural invasion. A ultrasound guided biopsy of supraclavicular portion of the lung mass demonstrated neoplastic plasma cells (Image 2a). Serum and urine electrophoresis revealed monoclonal spike with IgG Lambda chains. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed multiple myeloma (Image 2b) and he was diagnosed with an unusual case of Pancoast syndrome caused by multiple myeloma with extramedullary dissemination to lung. He completed a course of palliative radiation to the right lung mass and is currently on bortezomib and prednisone. Discussion(s): Pancoast tumors are primarily non-small cell lung cancers. Multiple myeloma presenting as Pancoast syndrome is less common. The prognosis of these patients is poor. The typical thoracic manifestation of multiple myeloma is bony involvement of the thoracic cage. Other manifestations are pneumonia, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, reticulonodular shadows, interstitial pattern and intrapulmonary calcification. Pancoast tumors, by their close vicinity to neurovascular structures like brachial plexus and subclavian vessels, often present with musculoskeletal pain and distal neurologic symptoms resulting in referral to orthopedicians or physiotherapists. Patients are initially treated for arthritis and bursitis of shoulder and a delay of 6-9 months have been reported in many cases before the tumor was discovered. We are reporting this case to emphasize the importance of including multiple myeloma in the work up of Pancoast syndrome. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

We compared patient radiation exposure resulting from diagnostic CTA and DSA examinations for both cerebral and cervicocerebral vessels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anthropomorphic phantom was irradiated by using typical diagnostic CTA and DSA setups and imaging parameters. For both imaging techniques, the imaging area of cerebral vessels included intracranial vessels only, while the imaging area of cervicocerebral vessels included both cervical and intracranial vessels from the aortic arch to the vertex. The effective dose was determined by using RPLDs. The DSA examination was simulated by using a biplane angiography system, and the CTA examination, by using a 64-row multidetector CT scanner. RESULT(S): For the imaging of cerebral vessels, the effective dose according to ICRP 103 was 0.67 mSv for CTA and 2.71 mSv for DSA. For the imaging of cervicocerebral vessels, the effective dose was 4.85 mSv for CTA and 3.60 mSv for DSA.

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is one of the most known and flexible mechanisms of DNA repair. This mechanism can recognize and remove damages causing DNA double-helix distortion, including the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and the pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts, promoted by ultraviolet light (UV). The human syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is clinically characterized chiefly by the early onset of severe photosensitivity of the exposed regions of the skin, a very high incidence of skin cancers and frequent neurological abnormalities. The xpa gene seems to be involved during UV damage recognition, in both global genome repair (GGR) and transcription-coupled repair (TCR). The modulation of xpa expression may modify the DNA repair rate in the cell genome, providing a valuable contribution to an understanding of the NER process. The controlled expression of the cDNA xpa in XP12RO deficient cells was achieved through the transfection of a muristerone-A inducible vector, pINXA. The INXA15 clone shows good induction of the XPA protein and total complementation of XP12RO cell deficiency. Overexpression of this protein resulted in UV cell survival comparable to normal control human cells. Moreover, low expression of the XPA protein in these cells is sufficient for total complementation in cellular UV sensitivity and DNA repair activity. These data demonstrate that XPA protein concentration is not a limiting factor for DNA repair.",Excluded
3265,"Time resolved dosimetry of human brain exposed to low frequency pulsed magnetic fields An accurate dosimetry is a key issue to understanding brain stimulation and related interaction mechanisms with neuronal tissues at the basis of the increasing amount of literature revealing the effects on human brain induced by low-level, low frequency pulsed magnetic fields (PMFs). Most literature on brain dosimetry estimates the maximum E field value reached inside the tissue without considering its time pattern or tissue dispersivity. Nevertheless a time-resolved dosimetry, accounting for dispersive tissues behavior, becomes necessary considering that the threshold for an effect onset may vary depending on the pulse waveform and that tissues may filter the applied stimulatory fields altering the predicted stimulatory waveform's size and shape. In this paper a time-resolved dosimetry has been applied on a realistic brain model exposed to the signal presented in Capone et al (2009 J. Neural Transm. 116 257-65), accounting for the broadband dispersivity of brain tissues up to several kHz, to accurately reconstruct electric field and current density waveforms inside different brain tissues.

3607,"Ca2+/calmodulin-binding peptides block phototransduction in Limulus ventral photoreceptors: evidence for direct inhibition of phospholipase C Phototransduction in Limulus photoreceptors involves a G protein-mediated activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and subsequent steps involving InsP3-mediated release of intracellular Ca2+. While exploring the role of calmodulin in this cascade, we found that intracellular injection of Ca2+/calmodulin-binding peptides (CCBPs) strongly inhibited the light response. By chemically exciting the cascade at various stages, we found the primary target of this effect was not in late stages of the cascade but rather at the level of G protein and PLC. That PLCdelta1 contains a calmodulin-like structure raised the possibility that PLC might be directly affected by CCBPs. To test this possibility, in vitro experiments were conducted on purified PLC. The activity of this enzyme was strongly inhibited by CCBPs and also inhibited by calmodulin itself. Our results suggest that the calmodulin-like region of PLC has an important role in regulating this enzyme.",Excluded

3383,"Urethral pain among prostate cancer survivors 1 to 14 years after radiation therapy PURPOSE: To investigate how treatment-related and non-treatment-related factors impact urethral pain among long-term prostate cancer survivors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Men treated for prostate cancer with radiation therapy at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Goteborg, Sweden from 1993 to 2006 were approached with a study-specific postal questionnaire addressing symptoms after treatment, including urethral burning pain during urination (n=985). The men had received primary or salvage external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or EBRT in combination with brachytherapy (BT). Prescribed doses were commonly 70 Gy in 2.0-Gy fractions for primary and salvage EBRT and 50 Gy plus 2x10.0 Gy for EBRT+BT. Prostatic urethral doses were assessed from treatment records. We also recruited 350 non-pelvic-irradiated, population-based controls matched for age and residency to provide symptom background rates.RESULTS: Of the treated men, 16% (137 of 863) reported urethral pain, compared with 11% (27 of 242) of the controls. The median time to follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 1.1-14.3 years). Prostatic urethral doses were similar to prescription doses for EBRT and 100% to 115% for BT. Fractionation-corrected dose and time to follow-up affected the occurrence of the symptom. For a follow-up>=3 years, 19% of men (52 of 268) within the 70-Gy EBRT+BT group reported pain, compared with 10% of men (23 of 222) treated with 70 Gy primary EBRT (prevalence ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.0). Of the men treated with salvage EBRT, 10% (20 of 197) reported urethral pain.CONCLUSIONS: Survivors treated with EBRT+BT had a higher risk for urethral pain compared with those treated with EBRT. The symptom prevalence decreased with longer time to follow-up. We found a relationship between fractionation-corrected urethral dose and pain. Among long-term prostate cancer survivors, the occurrence of pain was not increased above the background rate for prostatic urethral doses up to 70 Gy3.",Included

3315,"Effects of Photons Irradiation on <sup>18</sup>F-FET and <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA Uptake by T98G Glioblastoma Cells The differential diagnosis between brain tumors recurrence and early neuroinflammation or late radionecrosis is still an unsolved problem. The new emerging magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography diagnostic modalities still lack sufficient accuracy. In the last years, a great effort has been made to develop radiotracers able to detect specific altered metabolic pathways or tumor receptor markers. Our research project aims to evaluate irradiation effects on radiopharmaceutical uptake and compare the kinetic of the fluorinate tracers. T98G glioblastoma cells were irradiated at doses of 2, 10, and 20 Gy with photons, and <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA and <sup>18</sup>F-FET tracer uptake was evaluated. Activity and cell viability at different incubation times were measured. <sup>18</sup>F-FET and <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA are accumulated via the LAT-1 transporter, but <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA is further incorporated, whereas <sup>18</sup>F-FET is not metabolized.

This aspect is similar in the <sup>18</sup>F-FET TAC but less evident.

3174,"Adrenoreceptor development in rat cerebrum and the effects of ionizing radiation Previous studies in the rat have shown that neonatal radiation alters certain aspects of CNS monoaminergic systems including altering cerebral norepinephrine levels [17]. To determine if cerebral adrenoreceptor development is also altered by neonatal ionizing radiation, a single dose of whole body gamma-radiation was administered to rats on postnatal day two. This treatment did not alter (3H)-dihydroalprenolol (beta adrenoreceptor) or (3H)-WB4101 (alpha1 adrenoreceptor) binding when cerebra from irradiated animals were compared to age-matched sham-irradiated controls on postnatal days 9, 15 and 35.

Medical Research Council Lung Cancer Working Party In patients with non-metastatic but inoperable non-small cell lung cancer that is locally too extensive for radical radiotherapy (RT), but who have good performance status, it is important to determine whether thoracic RT should be the minimum that is required to palliate thoracic symptoms or whether treatment should be more intensive, with the aim of prolonging survival. A total of 509 such patients from 11 centres in the UK between November 1989 and October 1992 were admitted to a trial comparing palliative versus more intensive RT with respect to survival and quality of life. They were allocated at random to receive thoracic RT with either 17 Gy in two fractions (F2) 1 week apart (255 patients) or 39 Gy in 13 fractions (F13) 5 days per week (254 patients). Survival was better in the F13 group, the median survival periods being 7 months in the F2 group compared with 9 months in the F13 group, and the survival rates 31% and 36% at one year and 9% and 12% at 2 years, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.82; 95% CI0.69-0.99). There was a suggestion of a trend towards greater benefit in fitter patients. Metastases appeared earlier in the F2 group. As recorded by patients using the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, the commonest symptoms on admission were cough, shortness of breath, tiredness, lack of energy, worrying and chest pain. These were more rapidly palliated by the F2 regimen. Psychological distress was generally lower in the F13 group. Three patients (two F13, one F2) exhibited evidence of myelopathy. As recorded by patients using a diary card, 76% of the F2 compared with 81% of the F13 patients had dysphagia associated with their RT. This was transient, lasting for a median of 6.5 days in the F2 group compared with 14 days in the F13 group. In conclusion, the F2 regimen had a more rapid palliative effect. In the F13 group, although treatment-related dysphagia was worse, survival was longer.",Excluded
2470,"Light-Dependent OCT Structure Changes in Photoreceptor Degenerative rd 10 Mouse Retina Purpose: Using optical coherence tomography (OCT) to analyze the effects of light/dark adaptation in a mouse model of inherited photoreceptor degeneration (rd10), and to study dynamics of subretinal fluid during the progress of retinal degeneration.Methods: rd10 and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were reared in cyclic light or darkness and imaged with Bioptigen UHR-OCT or Spectralis HRA+OCT after adaptation to either light or darkness.Results: OCT images from rd10 mice were analyzed at three progressive stages of degeneration. After light-adaptation, stage I (postnatal age [P]26-29) eyes demonstrated no apparent subretinal fluid. At stage II (P32-38), subretinal fluid was present and restricted to parapapillary area, while at stage III (P44-45) extensive subretinal fluid was present across many retinal areas. Following overnight dark-adaptation, WT eyes showed a large reduction in outer retinal thickness (4.6 +/- 1.4 mum, n = 16), whereas this change was significantly smaller in stage I rd10 eyes (1.5 +/- 0.5 mum, n = 14). In stage II rd10 eyes, dark-adaptation significantly reduced the extent of subretinal fluid, with the amount of reduction correlating with the amount of fluid pre-existing in the light-adapted state. However, dark-adaptation did not significantly alter the amount of subretinal fluid observed in stage III rd10 mice. In addition, dark-rearing of rd10 mice from P6 to P30 slowed retinal degeneration.Conclusions: Visual experience in the form of light/dark adaptation exerts a significant effect on outer retinal structure in the context of photoreceptor degeneration. This effect may arise from light-dependent alterations in fluid transport across the RPE monolayer, and promote photoreceptor survival as induced by dark-rearing.",Excluded

3529,"A study on neuromodulation for optimizing subthalamic-nuclei stimulating effect of varied frequency parameters to enhance the gait with dual tasking in parkinson's disease Introduction: Gait disturbances and freezing-episodes are broad in advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and they worsen with dual (also multi) tasking. In PD, though, subthalamic-nuclei deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective-restorative-therapeutic option for enhancing motor, freezing-of-gait (FoG) and other axial-symptoms, albeit, its impact on gait-disturbances is hazy. Studies [1] suggest that low frequencies can augment gait-parameters provided frequency-parameters (including stimulation-intensity and pulse-width) are changed. Materials/Methods: 40Parkinson's post STN-DBS patients with gaitdisturbances were included in the study. All patients were on constant neurostimulation-parameters and dopaminergic-medication for a month prior to assessment. Gait-parameters were analyzed during-medication 'on' and DBS 'on' state, at 4 classes-of-frequencies 180Hz,130Hz,90Hz, and at 60Hz and DBS 'off' medication 'on' state. Gait was analyzed using stand-walk-sit (SWS) test and freezing-of-gait (FoG) scales. Total elapsed-times, number of steps/freezing episodes were analyzed in SWS test. Effect of dual-tasking on gait was analyzed using FoG score. While analyzing-parameters at differentfrequencies, Wilcoxon signed rank-test was employed. Result(s): 40Parkinson's on neuromodulation were studied, out of which 29 were male. Average mean-age was 55.45+10.76 years. Mean-duration of disease at the onset was 13.13+6.41 years. Post-surgery mean-duration was 3.58+2.4 years. 38Parkinson's showed significant-improvement in gait at a single-frequency, which was singular for each patient while 2patients showed optimal-response at two frequencies. In SWS-test, 17patients (42.5%) had good-response at 180Hz, 6(15%) at 130Hz,14(46.7%) at 90Hz,5 (12.5%) at 60Hz. [Table 1] Total FoG-scores and sub-scores based on dualtask also improved at similar frequencies. Discussion(s): Statistically-significant-improvement in all gait-parameters including dual-tasking at best-frequency in comparison to DBS 'off' and 130Hz, with chi2= 9.2857 with 2 degree-of-freedom, highly-significant at 5% (<0.0001). [Table 2] Optimal-frequency was independent of any demographic parameters, disease-severity or duration or other stimulation parameters [Fig 1]. There is a significant-effect of varying stimulation-frequencyparameters. The frequency-modulation certainly help PD patients with FoG and also axial-symptoms (particularly in case of bilateral STN-DBS). Conclusion(s): Optimization of frequency-parameter-setting for each Parkinson can recover gait yet with a cognitive-load. High and lowfrequencies may be of use and needs to be individualized. We also suggest that bilateral STN-stimulation enhances in case of the majority of axial-symptoms of Parkinson's and that a synergistic-result can be attained when DBS is used in concurrence with L-dopa.

3524,"Differential actions of corticotropin releasing factor on basolateral and central amygdaloid neurones, in vitro Intracellular current- and voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from basolateral (BLA) and central (ACe) neurones of the rat amygdala in vitro. The effect of superfusion of rat corticotropin releasing factor (rCRF) was examined on the ACe and BLA, nuclei with a high density of CRF-immunoreactive cell bodies and CRF receptors, respectively. rCRF (12.5-250 nM) had no effect on either resting membrane potential or input resistance in BLA neurones. In contrast, at low nanomolar concentrations rCRF (10-50 nM) caused hyperpolarisation and decreased membrane input resistance in the majority of ACe neurones. The equilibrium potential for this effect was -84 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.5 muM), suggesting that this response may be mediated by a postsynaptic increase in K<sup>+</sup> conductance. Furthermore, rCRF consistently reduced the amplitude of, and the current mediating, the slow afterhyperpolarisation following evoked action potential firing in both nuclei. This effect was concentration-dependent with an EC<inf>50</inf> of 40 nM in BLA neurones and was insensitive to tetrodotoxin and noradrenergic antagonists. In addition, the putative CRF antagonist alpha-helical CRF<inf>9-41</inf> (5 muM) blocked the effect of rCRF and showed partial agonist action on slow afterhyperpolarisations. In BLA neurones, rCRF (50 nM) prolonged the Ca<sup>2+</sup>- spike evoked in the presence of tetrodotoxin and tetraethylammonium (2 mM), suggesting that the blockade of the slow afterhyperpolarisation occurs subsequent to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. These results suggest that rCRF has a differential effect on the membrane properties of BLA and ACe neurones possibly by activation of a heterogeneous population of CRF receptors.",Excluded

Furthermore, we tested whether VAT estimations by these two methods are equivalent in assessing the metabolic risk in this population.DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Data from the Norwegian population of a multicenter study in adults with genetically proven PWS were used. Subjects with complete anthropometry, biochemical, and imagistic measurements at all study visits (baseline and after 12 and 24 months of GH treatment) (n = 14, six men) were included. VAT was quantified both using CT scans (GE Lightspeed 16 Pro) of the abdomen at L2-L3 level and a total body DXA scan (GE Healthcare Lunar Prodigy).RESULTS: VAT DXA was strongly associated with VAT CT at baseline (r = 0.97) and after 12 (r = 0.90) and 24 months (r = 0.89) of GH treatment (all P < .001). We found moderate to strong positive correlations between VAT by both methods, and blood pressure, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, glucose metabolism, and other fat depots (arms, legs, android, trunk, total body) but no association with age, gender, blood lipids, and IGF-I. Adiponectin was negatively associated with the amount of VAT.

3503,"The utility of surgical excision in the contemporary treatment of metastatic brain disease Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with oligometastatic brain disease are typically treated with SRS +/- tumor resection (with whole brain radiation [WBXRT] reserved for refractory cases). There exist no data regarding the local control benefits (if any) of surgery prior to SRS. Materials/Methods: Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all patients undergoing SRS with or without prior tumor excision at our institution. No patient had received prior WBXRT. Factors related to patient survival were determined by Cox regression; time-torecurrence (TTR) was analyzed similarly but with robust residuals to account for clustering. Non-progressing tumors which received WBXRT (for another progressing tumor) were censored at time of WBXRT. There were 162 patients identified (82/80 M/F, average 65.3), with a total of 260 tumors, of which 119 were solitary. Although surgical patients were younger, had better performance status and less burden of disease compared to SRS alone, none of these differences were statistically significant, although the RPA class was significantly better in the SRS+ surgery group (p = .003, Mann-Whitney). Forty-nine patients had a total of 51 tumors resected (2 patients with 2 resected), of which 33 were solitary. Complete resection, as determined by 24-hour contrasted MRI, was achieved in 45 (88%). A total of 73 tumors (28%) in 45 patients were considered to have locally progressed, 20 of which had previously undergone resection. Result(s): Median survival for all patients was 8.7 months, with survival for complete resection + SRS, incomplete resection + SRS and SRS alone at 14.1, 7.1, and 6.9 months, respectively (p = .03, log-rank). Survival by RPA class was 26.9, 8.7, and 1.5 for classes 1-3, respectively (p = .0004, log-rank). Median TTR was 14.8 months for all tumors, with TTR for complete resection + SRS, incomplete resection + SRS and SRS alone at 22.5, 6.4, and 14.8 months respectively (p = .004, log-rank). In the stepwise Cox regression analysis, overall survival was related to age (HR = 1.02, p = 0.037), ECOG performance score (HR = 1.9, p = 0.0001) and complete surgical excision (HR = .55, p = 0.01). Analysis of TTR demonstrated the following significantly related factors: radiation sensitive pathology (non-renal or melanoma) (HR = 0.367, p = 0.01), tumor size (HR = 1.43, p = 0.0012), and complete tumor resection (HR = 0.348, p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Although complete surgical excision + SRS are associated with prolonged survival, results may be skewed due to selection bias. TTR represents an unbiased estimate of the effect of surgery and shows SRS alone is associated with a 3 times increased likelihood of recurrence over complete resection + SRS, even when controlling for lesion size and pathology. Incomplete resection did not improve survival or TTR compared to SRS alone.",Excluded
2496,"Differential intensity-dependent effects of magnetic stimulation on the longest neurites and shorter dendrites in neuroscreen-1 cells OBJECTIVE: Magnetic stimulation (MS) is a potential treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders. This study investigates whether MS-regulated neuronal activity can translate to specific changes in neuronal arborization and thus regulate synaptic activity and function.APPROACH: To test our hypotheses, we examined the effects of MS on neurite growth of neuroscreen-1 (NS-1) cells over the pulse frequencies of 1, 5 and 10 Hz at field intensities controlled via machine output (MO). Cells were treated with either 30% or 40% MO. Due to the nature of circular MS coils, the center region of the gridded coverslip (zone 1) received minimal (~5%) electromagnetic current density while the remaining area (zone 2) received maximal (~95%) current density. Plated NS-1 cells were exposed to MS twice per day for three days and then evaluated for length and number of neurites and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).MAIN RESULTS: We show that MS dramatically affects the growth of the longest neurites (axon-like) but does not significantly affect the growth of shorter neurites (dendrite-like). Also, MS-induced changes in the longest neurite growth were most evident in zone 1, but not in zone 2. MS effects were intensity-dependent and were most evident in bolstering longest neurite outgrowth, best seen in the 10 Hz MS group. Furthermore, we found that MS-increased BDNF expression and secretion was also frequency-dependent. Taken together, our results show that MS exerts distinct effects when different frequencies and intensities are applied to the neuritic compartments (longest neurite versus shorter dendrite(s)) of NS-1 cells.SIGNIFICANCE: These findings support the concept that MS increases BDNF expression and signaling, which sculpts longest neurite arborization and connectivity by which neuronal activity is regulated. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MS is crucial for efficiently incorporating its use into potential therapeutic strategies.",Excluded
3392,"Large cell neuro-endocrine carcinoma presenting as pancoast's syndrome Pancoast's syndrome was first described in 1932 by Henry Pancoast as signs and symptoms of shoulder and arm pain, Horner's Syndrome, bone destruction and atrophy of hand muscles. While apical bronchial carcinoma commonly presents as Pancoast's syndrome, infection, benign tumors, and metastases should be considered. Thus, histopathological diagnosis is mandatory. Tumors of neural origin are rarely located at the thoracic inlet. We present a rare pathological tumor of Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (LCNEC) presenting as typical Pancoast's Syndrome. A 70-year-old man with lifelong smoking history presented with progressive pain in his left shoulder and armpit for 6 months. His other complaints were blurry vision in the left eye, hoarse voice, weight loss and decreased appetite. Examination was significant for decreased breath sounds, left sided shoulder tenderness, ptosis, small pupil with enopthalmos, and atrophy of the hypothenar muscles and decreased sensation on the ulnar distribution of the hand and forearm with decreased motor strength and handgrip. Imaging studies revealed left apical lung mass and a mediastinal mass abutting the aortic arch with lymph node involvement. MRI of brain and spine showed involvement of subarachnoid space with left and right paravertebral masses. A biopsy of the mass revealed tumor cells positive for CK7, TTF-1, synaptophysin and chromogranin. It was negative for Napsin A, CD56, markers of squamous differentiation p63 and p40. This immunoprofile is compatible with Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma. The patient was started on radiation therapy and was scheduled for chemotherapy as an outpatient. Neuroendocrine tumors are rare and can occur anywhere in the body. Currently, LCNEC is classified a variant of large cell carcinomas; however, it is different from typical lung large-cell carcinoma in that these tumors display biological behaviors resembling those of small cell lung carcinoma and features of high-grade neuroendocrine tumors. LCNEC represent only 3% of all pulmonary malignancies. The current treatment approach, which has remained unchanged for the past 30 years, involves combination of platinum based chemotherapy and radiation, however outcome remains poor. No targeted therapy exists for these tumors because therapeutic biomarkers are incompletely known. Thus, advances in the treatment of LCNEC are needed to improve survival in patients with this class of tumors. The discovery of new, rational targeted therapies as well as preclinical models that will encompass this important subtype of lung cancer is necessary. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of Pancoast's syndrome caused by a LCNEC. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

While heptamethine cyanine dye IR780 has excellent tumor targeting and imaging potential, its hydrophobic property limits its clinical use. In this study, we developed nanoparticle formulations to facilitate the use of IR780 for fluorescent imaging of malignant brain tumor.METHODS: Self-assembled IR780-liposomes and IR780-phospholipid micelles were prepared and their NIRF properties were characterized. The intracellular accumulation of IR780-nanoparticles in glioma cells were determined using confocal microscopy. The in vivo brain tumor targeting and NIRF imaging capacity of IR780-nanoparticles were evaluated using U87MG glioma ectopic and orthotopic xenograft models and a spontaneous glioma mouse model driven by RAS/RTK activation.RESULTS: The loading of IR780 into liposomes or phospholipid micelles was efficient. The particle diameter of IR780-liposomes and IR780-phospholipid micelles were 95 and 26 nm, respectively. While stock solutions of each preparation were maintained at ready-to-use condition, the IR780-phospholipid micelles were more stable. In tissue culture cells, IR780-nanoparticles prepared by either method accumulated in mitochondria, however, in animals the IR780-phospholipid micelles showed enhanced intra-tumoral accumulation in U87MG ectopic tumors.

Animals received 300-nl injections of either vehicle, CNQX, or MK-801 into the region of the SCN 5 min before a brief (10 min at 20 lx) light exposure. Local administration of either 1 mM CNQX or 1 mM MK-801 at circadian time (CT) 18 significantly inhibited light-induced phase advances (vehicle = 52 +/- 9 min; CNQX = 12 +/- 7 min; MK-801 = 12 +/- 5 min; P < 0.05 relative to vehicle+light group). The effects of both drugs were reversible and dose related. Injection of 1 mM MK-801 at CT13.5 resulted in a 71% inhibition of light-induced phase delays (vehicle = -51 +/- 6 min; MK-801 = -15 +/- 5 min; P < 0.05), while CNQX failed to significantly inhibit light-induced phase delays (-39 +/- 10 min).

2670,"Which prognostic index is most appropriate in the setting of delayed stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases? Objectives: To determine if five commonly used prognostic indices (PIs) - recursive partitioning analysis (RPA), Score Index for Radiosurgery (SIR), Basic Score for Brain Metastases (BSBM), graded prognostic assessment (GPA), and the diagnosis-specific GPA - are valid following delay between diagnosis and treatment of brain metastases. Method(s): In a single-institutional cohort, records of patients who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) more than 30 days from diagnosis of brain metastases were collected, and five PI scores were calculated for each patient. For each PI, three score-based groupings were made to examine survival differences by means of adjusted log-rank analysis and area under the curve (AUC). Result(s): Of 121 patients with sufficient PI information, 72 underwent SRS more than 30 days after diagnosis. Median age and Karnofsky performance status were 60 years and 80, respectively. Forty-three (60%) patients had lung primaries. Prior to SRS, 38 (52.8%) and 12 (16.7%) patients underwent whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and surgery, respectively. Two (2.8%) patients underwent both WBRT and surgery prior to SRS. A median of two lesions were treated per SRS course. Median survival of the cohort was 9.0 months. Using adjusted log-rank analysis for pairwise comparison, BSBM and GPA showed significance between two out of the three prognostic groups, while the other scores showed either one or no significant differences on comparison. AUC demonstrated good applicability for BSBM, RPA, and GPA, although SIR was statistically less prognostic than the other PIs. Conclusion(s): The PIs analyzed in this study were applicable in the setting of delayed SRS. Although these data are hypothesis generating, they serve to encourage further analyses to validate a PI that is most optimal for these patients.

3248,"Exposure to 2.45 GHz Radiation Triggers Changes in HSP-70, Glucocorticoid Receptors and GFAP Biomarkers in Rat Brain Brain tissue may be especially sensitive to electromagnetic phenomena provoking signs of neural stress in cerebral activity. Fifty-four adult female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent ELISA and immunohistochemistry testing of four relevant anatomical areas of the cerebrum to measure biomarkers indicating induction of heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70), glucocorticoid receptors (GCR) or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) after single or repeated exposure to 2.45 GHz radiation in the experimental set-up. Neither radiation regime caused tissue heating, so thermal effects can be ruled out. A progressive decrease in GCR and HSP-70 was observed after acute or repeated irradiation in the somatosensory cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus. In the limbic cortex; however, values for both biomarkers were significantly higher after repeated exposure to irradiation when compared to control animals. GFAP values in brain tissue after irradiation were not significantly different or were even lower than those of nonirradiated animals in all brain regions studied. Our results suggest that repeated exposure to 2.45 GHz elicited GCR/HSP-70 dysregulation in the brain, triggering a state of stress that could decrease tissue anti-inflammatory action without favoring glial proliferation and make the nervous system more vulnerable.",Excluded
3173,"Myeloid and lymphoid contribution to non-haematopoietic lineages through irradiation-induced heterotypic cell fusion Recent studies have suggested that regeneration of non-haematopoietic cell lineages can occur through heterotypic cell fusion with haematopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage. Here we show that lymphocytes also form heterotypic-fusion hybrids with cardiomyocytes, skeletal muscle, hepatocytes and Purkinje neurons. However, through lineage fate-mapping we demonstrate that such in vivo fusion of lymphoid and myeloid blood cells does not occur to an appreciable extent in steady-state adult tissues or during normal development. Rather, fusion of blood cells with different non-haematopoietic cell types is induced by organ-specific injuries or whole-body irradiation, which has been used in previous studies to condition recipients of bone marrow transplants. Our findings demonstrate that blood cells of the lymphoid and myeloid lineages contribute to various non-haematopoietic tissues by forming rare fusion hybrids, but almost exclusively in response to injuries or inflammation.",Excluded

3050,"Dark light, rod saturation, and the absolute and incremental sensitivity of mouse cone vision Visual thresholds of mice for the detection of small, brief targets were measured with a novel behavioral methodology in the dark and in the presence of adapting lights spanning ~8 log(10) units of intensity. To help dissect the contributions of rod and cone pathways, both wild-type mice and mice lacking rod (Gnat1(-/-)) or cone (Gnat2(cpfl3)) function were studied. Overall, the visual sensitivity of mice was found to be remarkably similar to that of the human peripheral retina. Rod absolute threshold corresponded to 12-15 isomerized pigment molecules (R*) in image fields of 800 to 3000 rods. Rod ""dark light"" (intrinsic retinal noise in darkness) corresponded to that estimated previously from single-cell recordings, 0.012 R* s(-1) rod(-1), indicating that spontaneous thermal isomerizations are responsible. Psychophysical rod saturation was measured for the first time in a nonhuman species and found to be very similar to that of the human rod monochromat. Cone threshold corresponded to ~5 R* cone(-1) in an image field of 280 cones. Cone dark light was equivalent to ~5000 R* s(-1) cone(-1), consistent with primate single-cell data but 100-fold higher than predicted by recent measurements of the rate of thermal isomerization of mouse cone opsins, indicating that nonopsin sources of noise determine cone threshold. The new, fully automated behavioral method is based on the ability of mice to learn to interrupt spontaneous wheel running on the presentation of a visual cue and provides an efficient and highly reliable means of examining visual function in naturally behaving normal and mutant mice.",Excluded

Forty patients who have had NPC successfully treated by a single radical course of radiotherapy of 70-80 Gy were studied at 2-12 years (mean 6.2 years) after radiotherapy. Each patient was examined clinically and with a pure-tone audiogram. Averaged hearing thresholds over 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 kHz were evaluated and a value > 30 dB was considered abnormal. The findings were compared with age-matched controls. The median hearing threshold for each ear in NPC patients was found to be 31.9 dB (range 10.0-86.3 dB) and that for controls 17.5 dB (7.5-38.8 dB) (P < 0.0005, Wilcoxon's matched pairs test). In NPC patients, 44 ears (55.0%) had abnormal hearing, of which 17 (21.3%), 5 (6.3%) and 22 (27.5%) ears had predominantly sensori-neural, conductive and mixed hearing losses, respectively. Nineteen ears had middle ear effusions, accounting for the majority of mixed and conductive hearing losses. In terms of individual patients, 8 (20.0%) and 18 (45.0%) patients had abnormal hearing in one year (monaural hearing disability) and both ears (binaural hearing disability), respectively. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of patients who have had radiotherapy for NPC, have hearing disability in the long-term, as compared to normal controls.",Included
2841,"Diencephalic locomotor region in the lamprey--afferents and efferent control In vertebrates, locomotion can be initiated by stimulation of the diencephalic locomotor region (DLR). Little is known of the different forebrain regions that provide input to the neurons in DLR. In the lamprey, it had been shown previously that DLR provides monosynaptic input to reticulospinal neurons, which in turn elicit rhythmic ventral root activity at the spinal level. To show that actual locomotor movements are produced from DLR, we use a semi-intact preparation in which the brain stem is exposed and the head fixed, while the body is left to generate actual swimming movements. DLR stimulation induced symmetric locomotor movements with an undulatory wave transmitted along the body. To explore if DLR is under tonic GABAergic input under resting conditions, as in mammals, GABAergic antagonists and agonists were locally administered into DLR. Injections of GABA agonists inhibited locomotion, whereas GABA antagonists facilitated the induction of locomotion. These findings suggest that GABAergic projections provide tonic inhibition that once turned off can release locomotion. Double-labeling experiments were carried out to identify GABAergic projections to the DLR. Populations of GABAergic projection neurons to DLR originated in the caudoventral portion of the medial pallium, the lateral and dorsal pallium, and the striatal area. These different GABAergic projection neurons, which also project to other brain stem motor centers, may represent the basal ganglia output to DLR. Moreover, electrical stimulation of striatum induced long-lasting plateau potentials in reticulospinal cells and associated locomotor episodes dependent on DLR being intact, suggesting that striatum may act via the basal ganglia output identified here.",Excluded

Mucositis can cause ulcers, and patients may experience pain and dysphasia which need treatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of pure natural honey on radiation induced mucositis.METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this randomized single blind (examiner blind) clinical trial 40 patients with head and neck cancer requiring radiation to the oropharyngeal mucosa were randomly assigned to two groups. Twenty patients assigned to the study group received honey, while both the study and control groups received standard head and neck radiation therapy based on a standard protocol. In the study group patients were instructed to take 20 ml of honey 15 minutes before radiation therapy, then again at intervals of 15 minutes and six hours after radiation. In the control group patients were instructed to rinse with 20 ml of saline before and after radiation. Patients were evaluated weekly for progression of mucositis using the Oral Mucositis Assessing Scale (OMAS). Data were analyzed using the independent t-test, Mann-Whitney, and Friedman tests.RESULTS: A significant reduction in mucositis among honey-received patients compared with controls (p=0.000) occurred.CONCLUSION: Within the limits of this study the results showed the application of natural honey is effective in managing radiation induced mucositis.CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Natural honey is a product with rich nutritional qualities that could be a pleasant, simple, and economic modality for the management of radiation mucositis.",Excluded

The simulations provide the possibility to perform cluster analysis in the space defined by potentially pharmacophoric measures such as dihedral angles, side-chain orientation, etc. By analyzing the statistics of the resulting clusters, the probability distribution of the side-chain conformations may be determined. These probabilities allow us to predict the selectivity of [Leu]enkephalin and [Met]enkephalin to the known mu- and delta-type opiate receptors to which they bind as agonists.

Of 97 patients with arteriovenous malformations who underwent follow-up angiography 2 years or more after a single radiosurgical procedure, 72 (74%) had complete obliteration of the vascular malformation. Of 209 patients who underwent radiosurgery for benign tumors (schwannomas, meningiomas, or pituitary adenomas) and had radiologic studies after 2 years or more of follow-up, tumor growth control was noted in 200 (96%). Tumor growth was also controlled in 90% of brain metastatic lesions at a median of 7 months after radiosurgery. Of 20 patients with trigeminal neuralgia and follow-up for more than 2 months, 14 (70%) were free of pain after radiosurgery.CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is a safe and effective management strategy for a wide variety of intracranial disorders.

2800,"Microinjection of morphine into various amygdaloid nuclei differentially affects nociceptive responsiveness and RVM neuronal activity The goal of the present study was to identify nuclei of the amygdala in which opioid-sensitive systems can act to recruit nociceptive modulatory circuitry in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and affect nociceptive responsiveness. In lightly anesthetized rats, 10 microg of morphine was bilaterally microinjected into basolateral, cortical, medial, central, and lateral nuclei of the amygdala to determine the relative influence on the activity of identified ON, OFF and NEUTRAL cells in the RVM and on the latency of the tail flick reflex evoked by noxious radiant heat. Infusions of morphine into the basolateral nuclei resulted in a substantial, naloxone-reversible increase in tail flick latency, and significantly increased ongoing firing of OFF cells and depressed that of ON cells. The reflex-related changes in cell firing were also attenuated. Morphine infusions into the cortical nuclei resulted in a small (approximately 1 s) but significant increase in tail flick latency. As with basolateral microinjections, ongoing activity of the OFF cells was increased, and although the ongoing firing of ON cells was not significantly changed, the reflex-related burst that characterizes these neurons was reduced. Microinjections in the medial nuclei again altered ongoing activity of both ON cells and OFF cells. However, the duration of the OFF cell pause and tail flick latency were unchanged. NEUTRAL cells were not affected by morphine at any site. Morphine applied within the central, medial lateral and dorsal lateral nuclei had no effect on RVM neurons or on the tail flick. Thus, focal application of morphine within the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala produced hypoalgesia and influenced RVM ON and OFF cells in a manner similar to that seen following systemic or RVM opioid administration. Opioid action within the medial and cortical nuclei also influenced RVM cell activity, but did not prevent the reflex-related OFF cell pause, and failed to alter the tail flick substantially. These observations, plus the lack of an opioid-activated influence from the central and lateral nuclei, demonstrate fundamental differences among systems linking the different amygdalar nuclei with the RVM. One way in which the modulatory circuitry of the RVM might be engaged physiologically in behaving animals is via opioid-mediated activation of the basolateral nucleus.",Excluded
2938,"Treatment of pituitary tumors: Radiation In this paper, the role of conventional radiotherapy and radiosurgery in the management of pituitary tumors is reviewed. After a short summary of the mechanism of action of irradiation therapy and the types of different irradiation techniques, the therapeutic effects and side effects are analyzed in patients with different types of pituitary tumors, including our own experience with conventional radiotherapy and radiosurgery in patients with acromegaly. Conventional fractionated radiotherapy has long been used to control growth and/or hormonal secretion of residual or recurrent pituitary tumors. However, patient selection for conventional radiotherapy still remains a controversial issue, because a number of potentially significant side effects, including hypopituitarism and other complications, have been described. Stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery methods have several potential advantages over conventional radiotherapy, including their use in patients with residual or recurrent pituitary tumors who had previously been treated by conventional radiotherapy, but long-term follow-up data with these relatively new techniques are still limited. © 2005 by Humana Press Inc.

2720,"Rectum separation in patients with cervical cancer for treatment planning in primary chemo-radiation Purpose: To proof feasibility of hydrogel application in patients with advanced cervical cancer undergoing chemo-radiation in order to reduce rectal toxicity from external beam radiation as well as brachytherapy.Material and methods: Under transrectal sonographic guidance five patients with proven cervical cancer underwent hydro gel (20 cc) instillation into the tip of rectovaginal septum adherent to posterior part of the visible cervical tumor. Five days after this procedure all patients underwent T2 weighted transversal and sagittal MRI for brachytherapy planning. MRI protocol included T2 weighted fast spin echo (FSE) imaging in sagittal, coronal and para-axial orientation using an 1.5 Tesla MRI. Separation of anterior rectal wall and cervix was documented. Result(s): Hydrogel application was uneventful in all patients and no toxicity was reported. Separation ranged from 7 to 26 mm in width (median 10 mm). The length of the separation varied between 18 and 38 mm (median 32 mm). In all patients displacement was seen in the posterior vaginal fornix, and/or at the deepest part of uterine cervix depending on the extension of the cul-de-sac in correlation to the posterior wall of the uterus. In patients with bulky tumor and/or deep (vaginal) extend of peritoneal cavity tumour was seen mainly cranial from the rectovaginal space and therefore above the hydrogeI application. Only in the extra-peritoneal (lower) part of the cervix a good separation could be achieved between the rectum and cervix. Conclusion(s): Hydrgel instillation in patients with cervial cancer undergoing chemoradiation is safe and feasible. Because of the loose tissue of the cul-de-sac and its intra- and extraperitoneal part, hydrogel instillation of 20 cc did not result in a sufficient separation of the cervix from anterior wall. © 2012 Marnitz et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

Method(s): Histologically proven glioblastoma patients underwent IMRT dose escalation. IMRT was delivered over 5 weeks with the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique to the two planning target volumes (PTVs) defined by adding 5-mm margin to the respective clinical target volumes (CTVs). CTV1 was the tumor bed plus the enhancing lesion with 10-mm margin; CTV2 was the area of perifocal edema with 20-mm margin. Only the PTV1 dose was escalated (planned dose escalation: 60, 62.5, 65, 67.5, 70 Gy) while the PTV2 dose remained the same (45 Gy). Result(s): Forty consecutive glioblastoma patients were treated. While no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was recorded during the dose escalation up to 67.5/2.7 Gy, two out of the first six consecutively enrolled patients on the highest dose level (70/2.8 Gy) experienced a DLT, and therefore a cohort expansion was required. 3/14 patients experienced a DLT on the highest planned dose level, and therefore the MTD was not exceeded. After a median follow-up time of 25 months no grade >2 late neurological toxicity was recorded. Conclusion(s): By using a SIB IMRT technique, a radiation dose of 70 Gy in 25 fractions (biological effective dose - BED - of 92.8 Gy) can be delivered with concurrent and sequential standard dose TMZ, without unacceptable acute toxicity in patients with glioblastoma. © 2012 Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
3228,"Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix: Does treatment sequence and type of hysterectomy improve outcomes? Objectives: Small cell neuroendocrine cervical cancer is rare, with a high propensity for distant metastasis, and there is no consensus on optimal treatment. Treatment of early-stage disease usually involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy (RT), and surgery. Our goal was to assess the outcomes of various treatment modalities and sequences of treatments and to identify prognostic factors associated with survival. Method(s): Patients with small cell neuroendocrine cervical cancer reported to the National Cancer Database from 1998 to 2011 who underwent at least a total hysterectomy (radical or simple)were selected. To exclude for potentially palliative interventions, we included only patients with stage I-IIA disease for this analysis. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, univariate comparisons were made with log-rank tests, and multivariable analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards modeling. All tests were two-tailed, with threshold significance level set at P < 0.05. Result(s): A total of 1703 small cell neuroendocrine cervical cancer patients were identified, and 249 patients met inclusion criteria. Increasing tumor size was significantly associated with nodal positivity (14%, 26%, 34%, and 63% for tumor sizes <=2 cm, 2.1-3 cm, 3.1-5 cm, and >5 cm, respectively, P=0.001). Lymph node metastasis was significantly associated with worse survival (median OS 35 vs. 108 months for lymph node-positive and -negative, respectively, P=0.012). No other factors were found to be associated with survival on univariate analyses, including age, stage, comorbidity index, tumor size, type of surgery, margin status, use of chemotherapy, and use of RT. On multivariable analysis using historically significant factors of cervical cancer survival, including age, race, comorbidity index, stage, tumor size, RT, chemotherapy, and hysterectomy type, only positive nodal status (HR 4.317, 95% CI 1.132-16.464, P = 0.032) significantly predicted survival.

The type of hysterectomy, receipt of chemotherapy, or timing of radiation (adjuvant vs. neoadjuvant) did not appear to affect OS. Optimal treatment of this disease remains elusive.",Excluded
2431,"Lack of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) in layer 2/3 interneurons that receive cannabinoid-sensitive inhibitory inputs In layer 2/3 of neocortex, brief trains of action potentials in pyramidal neurons (PNs) induce the mobilization of endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs), resulting in a depression of GABA release from the terminals of inhibitory interneurons (INs). This depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) is mediated by activation of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) on presynaptic terminals of a subset of INs. However, it is not clear whether CB1 receptors are also expressed at synapses between INs, and whether INs can release eCBs in response to depolarization. In the present studies, brain slices containing somatosensory cortex were prepared from 14- to 21-day-old CD-1 mice. Whole cell recordings were obtained from layer 2/3 PNs and from INs classified as regular spiking nonpyramidal, irregular spiking, or fast spiking. For all three classes of INs, the cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 suppressed inhibitory synaptic activity, similar to the effect seen in PNs. In addition, trains of action potentials in PNs resulted in significant DSI. In INs, however, DSI was not seen in any cell type, even with prolonged high-frequency spike trains that produced calcium increases comparable to that seen with DSI induction in PNs. In addition, blocking eCB reuptake with AM404, which enhanced DSI in PNs, failed to unmask any DSI in INs. Thus the lack of DSI in INs does not appear to be due to an insufficient increase in intracellular calcium or enhanced reuptake. These results suggest that layer 2/3 INs receive CB1-expressing inhibitory inputs, but that eCBs are not released by these INs.",Excluded

Thus, we tested whether insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) alone or in combination modulate radiation tolerance of the rat cervical spinal cord.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cervical spinal cord of 68 adult Fisher F344 rats received a total dose of 30-36 Gy, given as a single fraction of 16 Gy followed by a second radiation dose of 14-20 Gy. Continuous intrathecal infusion of bFGF (44 rats) or saline (24 rats) into the cisterna magna was given concomitantly. A further experiment included 14 additional rats which were treated with subcutaneous injection of IGF-1 parallel to irradiation with a total dose of 34 Gy or 36 Gy. 20 rats received combined treatment, i.e. intrathecal infusion of bFGF plus subcutaneous injection of IGF-1, starting 24 hours before irradiation (total dose 33 Gy or 36 Gy) for a total of 4 days. Animals were followed until myelopathy developed or for a maximum of 12 months. Histopathologic examinations were performed post mortem.RESULTS: Treatment with bFGF alone or IGF-1 alone increased the median time to myelopathy significantly. In the 36-Gy group, after combination treatment a comparable prolongation of latency was seen. Moreover, rats treated with 33 Gy and combined bFGF plus IGF-1 showed a significantly reduced risk of myelopathy, too (p = 0.0015, Figures 1 and 2).CONCLUSION: Combination of IGF-1 and bFGF was more potent than single agent treatment. We observed a significantly reduced myelopathy rate at an intermediate radiation dose level and a longer time to myelopathy at a high-dose level. This finding strengthens the evidence that brief therapeutic intervention can decrease radiation-induced neurotoxicity. Further studies will be undertaken to optimize this strategy.",Excluded
3523,"Differential actions of corticotropin releasing factor on basolateral and central amygdaloid neurones, in vitro Intracellular current- and voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from basolateral (BLA) and central (ACe) neurones of the rat amygdala in vitro. The effect of superfusion of rat corticotropin releasing factor (rCRF) was examined on the ACe and BLA, nuclei with a high density of CRF-immunoreactive cell bodies and CRF receptors, respectively. rCRF (12.5-250 nM) had no effect on either resting membrane potential or input resistance in BLA neurones. In contrast, at low nanomolar concentrations rCRF (10-50 nM) caused hyperpolarisation and decreased membrane input resistance in the majority of ACe neurones. The equilibrium potential for this effect was -84 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.5 microM), suggesting that this response may be mediated by a postsynaptic increase in K+ conductance. Furthermore, rCRF consistently reduced the amplitude of, and the current mediating, the slow after hyperpolarisation following evoked action potential firing in both nuclei. This effect was concentration-dependent with an EC50 of 40 nM in BLA neurones and was insensitive to tetrodotoxin and noradrenergic antagonists. In addition, the putative CRF antagonist alpha-helical CRF9-41 (5 microM) blocked the effect of rCRF and showed partial agonist action on slow after hyperpolarisations. In BLA neurones, rCRF (50 nM) prolonged the Ca(2+)-spike evoked in the presence of tetrodotoxin and tetraethylammonium (2 mM), suggesting that the blockade of the slow after hyperpolarisation occurs subsequent to Ca2+ entry. These results suggest that rCRF has a differential effect on the membrane properties of BLA and ACe neurones possibly by activation of a heterogeneous population of CRF receptors.",Excluded
3478,"Transcription coupled repair deficiency results in increased chromosomal aberrations and apoptotic death in the UV61 cell line, the Chinese hamster homologue of Cockayne's syndrome B Transcription coupled repair (TCR), a special sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER), removes transcription blocking lesions rapidly from the transcribing strand of active genes. In this study, we have evaluated the importance of the TCR pathway in the induction of chromosomal aberrations and apoptosis in isogenic Chinese hamster cell lines, which differ in TCR efficiency. AA8 is the parental cell line, which is proficient in the genome overall repair of UV-C radiation induced 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PP) and the repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) from the transcribing strand of active genes. UV61 cells (hamster homologue of human Cockayne's syndrome (CS) group B cells) originally isolated from AA8, exhibit proficient repair of 6-4 PP but are deficient in CPD removal by the TCR pathway. Upon UV-C irradiation of cells in G1-phase, UV61 showed a dramatic increase in apoptotic response as compared to AA8 cells. Abolition of TCR by treatment with alpha-amanitin (an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II) in AA8 cells also resulted in an elevated apoptotic response like that observed in UV61 cells treated with UV alone. This suggests that the lack of TCR is largely responsible for increased apoptotic response in UV61 cells. Furthermore, the chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) induced by UV were also found to be higher in UV61 cells than in TCR proficient AA8 cells. This study shows that the increased chromosomal aberrations and apoptotic death in UV61 cells is due to their inability to remove CPD from the transcribing strand of active genes and suggests a protective role for TCR in the prevention of both chromosomal aberrations and apoptosis induced by DNA damage.

Spearman's rank correlation was calculated between NCF and QOL, using each patient's own data, at each time point. To test the hypothesis that NCF declines before QOL changes, the predictive effect of NCF from previous visits on QOL was studied with a linear mixed-effects model. Neurocognitive function or QOL deterioration was defined relative to each patient's own baseline. Lead or lag time, defined as NCF deterioration before or after the date of QOL decline, respectively, was computed.RESULTS: At baseline, all NCF tests showed statistically significant correlations with ADL, which became stronger at 4 months. A similar observation was made with FACT-Br. Neurocognitive function scores from previous visits predicted ADL (p < 0.05 for seven of eight tests) or FACT-Br. Scores on all eight NCF tests deteriorated before ADL decline (net lead time 9-153 days); and scores on six of eight NCF tests deteriorated before FACT-Br (net lead time 9-82 days).CONCLUSIONS: Neurocognitive function and QOL are correlated. Neurocognitive function scores from previous visits are predictive of QOL. Neurocognitive function deterioration precedes QOL decline. The sequential association between NCF and QOL decline suggests that delaying NCF deterioration is a worthwhile treatment goal in brain metastases patients.",Excluded

3320,"Comparison of Whole Heart Computed Tomography Scanners for Image Quality Lower Radiation Dosing in Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography: The CONVERGE Registry RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Novel technology in coronary computed tomographic angiography allows assessment of coronary artery disease with high image quality (IQ). There are currently two wide detector ""whole heart"" coverage scanners available, which avoid misregistration artifacts. However, there are no data directly comparing IQ between the two scanners. The aim of the current study is to investigate if IQ is different between the most scanners of GE and Toshiba broad detector scanners.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective, observational, multicenter international cohort study comparing 236 consecutive patients who underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography using whole-heart scanners; 126 patients on scanner S1 ( Aquilion ONE Vision, Toshiba), and 110 patients on scanner S2 (Revolution CT, GE Healthcare). Hounsfield units were measured using regions of interest in the descending aorta at 6 points (cranial slice, level of the visualized first, second, third, and fourth spines, and the caudal slice). We also compared the coverage length (z-axis) of the full width field of view between a single rotation of the two scanners.RESULTS: Evaluating mean CT attenuation values Hounsfield units through the scan range, are progressively reduced across the descending aorta in the S1 group, resulting in the larger difference of contrast brightness between the cranial and caudal slices compared to the S2 group (absolute difference: S2 13.0 +/- 4.4 vs S1 141.9 +/- 16.4, p < 0.0001; Percent difference: 19.3 +/- 2.1 vs -3.4 +/- 1.2, <0.0001). The standard deviation (SD) is similar at the cranial slice between the two scanners, however, the S1 group demonstrated higher SD-differential from cranial to caudal than S2 group. Median radiation exposure was significantly lower for the S2 scanner 1.50 +/- 0.75 mSv vs the S1 system 1.9 mSv (IQR 1.7-2.7 mSv) (p=0.01). Z-axis coverage was larger for the S2 scanner 152.5 mm (244 slices x 0.625 mm/slice) than 133 mm for S1 (266 slices x 0.5 mm/slice).CONCLUSION: Although both ""volume"" scanners cover the whole heart z-axis with one beat, scans using the S1 scanner have a larger variability in attenuation values throughout the scan range, resulting in 20% increase in nonuniformity from cranial to caudal slice. Additionally, SD variation across the field of view, a metric of noise, is larger when using the S1 scanner vs the S2 scanner. These results indicate that the GE Revolution CT has more uniform contrast enhancement and more coverage, lower radiation and lower image noise compared to the Toshiba Aquilion ONE Vision system.",Excluded

3567,"Differential patterning of neuronal, glial and neural progenitor cells on phosphorus-doped and UV irradiated diamond-like carbon Diamond-like carbon (DLC) is an attractive biomaterial for coating human implantable devices. Our particular research interest is in developing DLC as a coating material for implants and electrical devices for the nervous system. We previously reported that DLC is not toxic to N2a neuroblastoma cells or primary cortical neurons and showed that phosphorus-doped DLC (P:DLC) could be used to produce patterned neuron networks. In the present study we complement and extend these findings by exploring patterning of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants, human neural progenitor cells (hNPC) and U-87 astroglioma cells on P:DLC. Further P:DLC data is provided to highlight that P:DLC can be used as an effective coating material for in vitro multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) with potential for patterning groups of neurons on selected electrodes. We also introduce ultraviolet (UV) irradiation as a simple treatment to render DLC neurocompatible. We show that UV:DLC can be used to support patterned and unpatterned cortical neuron growth. These findings strongly support the use of DLC as tailorable and tuneable substrate to study neural cell biology in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that DLC is a well-suited candidate material for coating implantable devices in the human nervous system.",Excluded
3377,"Direct Parametric Reconstruction for Improved Characterization of Neurotransmitter Release using Dynamic PET Objectives: Kinetic analyses of dynamic PET data with reversibly binding receptor-ligand radiotracers can be used to detect endogenous neurotransmitter (NT) releases elicited by cognitive tasks or drug stimulation. Conventionally, NT release is characterized by fitting time-activity curves (TACs) with an appropriate kinetic model such as LSRRM (Alpert et al 2003), an extension of the simplified reference region model that incorporates time-varying binding due to tracer displacement by NT. A limitation of this 'indirect' approach, however, is the poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the estimated parametric images. In the current work, we developed a method for estimation of LSRRM parametric maps with significantly higher SNR by direct parameter estimation from raw dynamic PET projection data. We conducted simulation and human C-raclopride studies to evaluate the performance of this method against the standard indirect method. Method(s): A numerical phantom comprised of 22 different brain regions including 7 striatal sub-divisions was created using the MNI atlas. Kinetic parameters values were assigned to each brain region based on measurements performed on 16 subjects studied with C-raclopride. Dopamine (DA) release was simulated in the striatum (executive area). LSRRM was used to generate the corresponding 4-D (i.e., 3-D + time) activity images which were then forward-projected to produce noise-free dynamic sinograms. Attenuation, detector sensitivity, point spread function and radioactive decay were modeled during sinogram data generation. After scaling to standard counts levels, Poisson noise was added to the sinograms to achieve noise levels comparable to our human studies. For empirical evaluation, a 45-min human study was conducted on the Siemens mMR camera using C-raclopride (13.5mCi). A reward task was started ~27 min after radiotracer injection to induce striatal DA release. For both simulation and human studies, parametric images of binding potential with non-displaceable reference (BP<inf>ND</inf>) and magnitude of DA release (gamma) were computed using the indirect method and the proposed direct method. For the indirect approach, parameters were estimated by pixel-wise application of LSRRM using the cerebellum as a reference tissue input and weighted least-squares fitting of TACs obtained following fully-3D dynamic OSEM reconstruction. No post-reconstruction smoothing was included. For the direct method, parameters were directly estimated from the dynamic sinograms by preconditioned conjugate gradient based optimization of a four-dimensional Poisson log-likelihood objective function incorporating LSRRM kinetics and accounting for the effects of attenuation, sensitivity, scatter and randoms. Result(s): In simulation studies, the indirect method estimated striatal BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma with 7.8% and 79.2% bias, respectively. For the direct reconstruction, bias was reduced to 6.9% and 5.5% for striatal BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma estimates, respectively. Coefficients of variation ('CV', i.e. pixel-wise variability) of striatal BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma estimates were 65.3% and 72.0% for the indirect method as compared to 17.4% and 17.9% for the direct method. Likewise, in the human study, the direct method yielded BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma images with improved SNR. CV of BP<inf>ND</inf> and gamma estimates in the putamen were 71.4% and 91.4% for the indirect method and 32.9% and 37.6% for the direct method. Conclusion(s): Direct reconstruction can reduce bias and increase the SNR of parametric images. The method has the potential to improve the characterization of localized neurotransmitter release, potentially allowing detection of weaker effects, reducing the needed sample size, or reducing radioactivity dose to facilitate repeated experiments or minimize radiation exposure.",Excluded

3181,"Spatial correlation of linear energy transfer and relative biological effectiveness with suspected treatment-related toxicities following proton therapy for intracranial tumors PURPOSE: The enhanced relative biological effectiveness (RBE) at the end of the proton range might increase the risk of radiation-induced toxicities. This is of special concern for intracranial treatments where several critical organs at risk (OARs) surround the tumor. In the light of this, a retrospective analysis of dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LET<sub>d</sub> ) and RBE-weighted dose (D<sub>RBE</sub> ) distributions was conducted for three clinical cases with suspected treatment-related toxicities following intracranial proton therapy. Alternative treatment strategies aiming to reduce toxicity risks are also presented.METHODS: The clinical single-field optimized (SFO) plans were recalculated for 81 error scenarios with a Monte Carlo dose engine. The fractionation D<sub>RBE</sub> was 1.8 Gy (RBE) in 28 or 30 fractions assuming a constant RBE of 1.1. Two LET<sub>d</sub> - and alpha/beta-dependent variable RBE models were used for evaluation, including a sensitivity analysis of the alpha/beta parameter. Resulting distributions of D<sub>RBE</sub> and LET<sub>d</sub> were analyzed together with normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs). Subsequently, four multi-field optimized (MFO) plans, with an additional beam and/or objectives penalizing protons stopping in OARs, were created to investigate the potential reduction of LET<sub>d</sub> , D<sub>RBE</sub> , and NTCP.RESULTS: The two variable RBE models agreed well and predicted average RBE values around 1.3 in the toxicity volumes, resulting in an increased near-maximum D<sub>RBE</sub> of 7-11 Gy (RBE) compared to RBE = 1.1 in the nominal scenario. The corresponding NTCP estimates increased from 0.8%, 0.0%, and 3.7% (RBE = 1.1) to 15.5%, 1.8%, and 45.7% (Wedenberg RBE model) for the three patients, respectively. The MFO plans generally allowed for LET<sub>d</sub> , D<sub>RBE</sub> , and NTCP reductions in OARs, without compromising the target dose. Compared to the clinical SFO plans, the maximum reduction in the near-maximum LET<sub>d</sub> was 56%, 63%, and 72% in the OAR exhibiting the toxicity for the three patients, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Although a direct causality between RBE and toxicity cannot be established here, high LET<sub>d</sub> and D<sub>RBE</sub> correlated spatially with the observed toxicities, whereas setup and range uncertainties had a minor impact. Individual factors, which might affect the patient-specific radiosensitivity, were however not included in these calculations. The MFO plans using both an additional beam and proton track-end objectives allowed the largest reductions in LET<sub>d</sub> , D<sub>RBE</sub> , and NTCP, and might be future tools for similar cases.",Excluded
3349,"Inhibiting the inhibition: a neuronal network for sound localization in reverberant environments The precedence effect describes the phenomenon whereby echoes are spatially fused to the location of an initial sound by selectively suppressing the directional information of lagging sounds (echo suppression). Echo suppression is a prerequisite for faithful sound localization in natural environments but can break down depending on the behavioral context. To date, the neural mechanisms that suppress echo directional information without suppressing the perception of echoes themselves are not understood. We performed in vivo recordings in Mongolian gerbils of neurons of the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL), a GABAergic brainstem nucleus that targets the auditory midbrain, and show that these DNLL neurons exhibit inhibition that persists tens of milliseconds beyond the stimulus offset, so-called persistent inhibition (PI). Using in vitro recordings, we demonstrate that PI stems from GABAergic projections from the opposite DNLL. Furthermore, these recordings show that PI is attributable to intrinsic features of this GABAergic innervation. Implementation of these physiological findings into a neuronal model of the auditory brainstem demonstrates that, on a circuit level, PI creates an enhancement of responsiveness to lagging sounds in auditory midbrain cells. Moreover, the model revealed that such response enhancement is a sufficient cue for an ideal observer to identify echoes and to exhibit echo suppression, which agrees closely with the percepts of human subjects.",Excluded
2531,"Management of patients with oligometastatic/ resectable stage IV NSCLC For the past decade, the standard first-line therapy for stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with adequate ECOG performance status (<2) has been platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with a reported median overall survival (OS) of 8-10 months, which has slightly improved to 12 months with the addition of bevacizumab. More recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor, gefitinib and erlotinib, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase, crizotinib, have been shown to provide longer progression-free survival (PFS) and fewer side effects as first-line therapy, compared with chemotherapy in patients with certain histological subtypes and activating mutations. However, despite therapeutic developments, palliative treatment is standard for many stage IV NSCLC patients and the prognosis remains poor, with relative 5-year survival rates <=4%, compared with an average of approximately 17% for all patients with NSCLC. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a subgroup of stage IV NSCLC with a limited number/ number of sites of metastatic disease, usually 1-5 metastatic lesions. While only a small subset of patients present with such limited metastases (brain metastasis <50%, adrenal gland metastasis ~7%), they may be suitable for, and achieve long-term survival following, eradication of both the primary and metastatic tumours. For example, reported 5-year survival rates for NSCLC patients with solitary brain or adrenal metastasis who underwent surgical removal of both primary lung and metastatic disease ranged from 7-24% and 25-34%, respectively, which is higher than the average of <=4% for all stage IV NSCLC patients. In addition to having an adequate performance status, there are additional key prognostic factors for identifying oligometastatic NSCLC patients likely to benefit from aggressive therapy; staging of the metastatic lesions, lymph node involvement and status of the primary lung tumour. A lower number of metastatic sites is predictive of good clinical outcome, with >2 metastatic sites associated with shorter PFS. The organ involved in metastatic spread may also impact clinical outcome as, for instance, patients with brain and adrenal gland metastases are more suitable for surgical intervention compared with bone or liver. Given the importance of number and site of metastatic lesions, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are vital for accurate staging of oligometastatic disease. An association between N0 disease and increased long-term survival compared with N1/N2 disease has been observed. For example, following surgical treatment of one cohort of patients with solitary NSCLC adrenal gland metastasis, those with N2 disease had 0% median 5-year survival rate, compared with 52% for N0/N1 patients (P=0.001). Pathologic staging of lymph nodes is therefore critical. The status of the primary lung tumour also impacts clinical outcome, as the primary tumour must itself be resectable. Stage III primary disease is associated with worse survival outcome than stage I or II in patients undergoing surgical excision of brain and adrenal gland metastases, with a reported 5-year survival rate of 0% for stage III, compared with 63% and 77% for stage I and II, respectively. Similarly, patients with oligometastatic disease and a controlled primary site, or 'oligorecurrance', have better prognosis than those with an uncontrolled primary tumour. Histological subtype of NSCLC may also impact prognosis in oligometastatic NSCLC, with adenocarcinoma associated with the most favourable outcomes. Although an optimal disease-free interval (DFI) to define synchronous and metachronous disease has not been agreed upon, synchronous oligometastasis is generally associated with poorer survival outcomes. Patients receiving adrenalectomy for oligometastatic NSCLC with DFI <=6 months had median OS of 12 months versus 31 months for DFI >6 months. Similar results were reported for isolated brain metastasis. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a stage IV cancer and as a guiding principle therapy should be simple and minimally invasive. Furthermore, given the diffuse nature of this disease state, management should ideally involve a multidisciplinary team as the primary and metastatic cancer must be treated, requiring a wide range of expertise. Surgery and radiosurgery (stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS] in the brain and stereotactic body radiotherapy [SBRT] in extracranial sites) are the two most common methods of tumour ablation. In general, radiosurgery is less invasive than surgery and is therefore useful for patients ineligible for surgery. Additionally, evidence suggests SBRT may be more applicable to limited extracranial metastasis to multiple organs compared with surgery. The treatment of limited brain metastases has been evaluated through several randomised clinical trials. Surgical resection plus whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of oligometastasis in the brain led to significantly prolonged OS compared with WBRT alone - as high as 40 weeks in one trial, compared with 15 weeks for WBRT (P<0.01). Further, a study of SRS with WBRT in patients with 1-4 brain metastases showed improved survival outcomes for patients with solitary brain metastases and improved clinical outcomes for patients with >1 site of metastatic disease, compared with WBRT alone. Overall, SRS plus WBRT is considered an acceptable choice for those patients with limited brain metastasis who are not suitable for surgery. Adrenalectomy is the standard of care for adrenal gland metastases, with OS ranging from 11-31 months. There have been no randomised trials of the use of SBRT in the adrenal gland setting, although one retrospective study reported OS of 23 months for isolated adrenal metastases treated with SBRT. Further, a recent review article of extracranial oligometastatic disease from various primary cancers suggests that survival following SBRT compares favourably to surgery. One of the key challenges for the management of oligometastatic NSCLC is continuing to improve diagnosis and prognostic factors to more accurately identify those patients with oligometastatic NSCLC who are likely to benefit from ablative treatment, as well as distinguish truly isolated metastatic disease from early-stage metastasis that later develops into widely disseminated disease. Continuing advances in imaging technology will play a role in refining diagnosis and prognosis. From a treatment perspective, challenges include cognitive problems associated with WBRT and the current lack of randomised trial data comparing surgery, radiosurgery and standard of care. To this end, there are several ongoing clinical trials, such as the randomized SABR-COMET study, which compares palliative radiation with stereotactic ablative radiation for <=3 metastatic tumours to any single organ.",Excluded

Each subject flew once with a tablet containing scopolamine and once with a placebo in a random order, crossover design. Signs and symptoms of motion sickness were systematically recorded during each parabola by an investigator who was blind to the content of the tablet. Compared with flights using placebo, flights with buccal scopolamine resulted in significantly lower scores for nausea (31%-35% reduction) and vomiting (50% reduction in number of parabolas with vomiting). Side effects of the drug during flight were negligible. We conclude that buccal scopolamine is more effective than a placebo in treating ongoing motion sickness.",Excluded
2995,"Dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a prime candidate for image-guided radiotherapy. This study was designed to assess the feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy by quantifying the dosimetric effects induced by the magnetic field in patients' plans and identifying the associated clinical consequences.METHODS: Monte Carlo dose calculation was performed for nine patients of various treatment sites (lung, liver, prostate, brain, skull-base, and spine) and tissue homogeneities, in the presence of 0.5 and 1.5 T magnetic fields. Dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters such as D95, D5, and V20 as well as equivalent uniform dose were compared for the target and organs at risk, before and after applying the magnetic field. The authors further assessed whether the plans affected by clinically relevant dose distortions could be corrected independent of the planning system.RESULTS: By comparing the resulting dose distributions and analyzing the respective DVHs, it was determined that despite the observed lateral beam deflection, for magnetic fields of up to 0.5 T, neither was the target coverage jeopardized nor was the dose to the nearby organs increased in all cases except for prostate. However, for a 1.5 T magnetic field, the dose distortions were more pronounced and of clinical concern in all cases except for spine. In such circumstances, the target was severely underdosed, as indicated by a decrease in D95 of up to 41% of the prescribed dose compared to the nominal situation (no magnetic field). Sites such as liver and spine were less affected due to higher tissue homogeneity, typically smaller beam range, and the choice of beam directions. Simulations revealed that small modifications to certain plan parameters such as beam isocenter (up to 19 mm) and gantry angle (up to 10degree) are sufficient to compensate for the magnetic field-induced dose disturbances. The authors' observations indicate that the degree of required corrections strongly depends on the beam range and direction relative to the magnetic field. This method was also applicable to more heterogeneous scenarios such as skull-base tumors.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy and delivering a clinically acceptable dose to patients with various tumor locations within magnetic fields of up to 1.5 T. This work could serve as a guide and encouragement for further efforts toward clinical implementation of hybrid MRI-proton gantry systems.",Excluded

3461,"A new technique of ""double-A"" bilateral flaps based on perforators for the treatment of sacral defects BACKGROUND: Myocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps can provide stable coverage of sacral defects. For neurologically intact patients, sensate innervated gluteal artery perforator flaps are the ideal solution. For patients with spinal cord injury, soft-tissue coverage can be performed with a variety of noninnervated flaps. METHOD(S): Between 1997 and 2004, the authors operated on 30 patients, 21 men and nine women, using bilateral gluteal distal fasciocutaneous and proximal musculocutaneous vertical vector rotation-advancement flaps, based on perforators with V-Y closures. The ages of the patients ranged from 32 to 74 years. Twenty-five patients had spinal cord injuries and all had sacral pressure sores extending to the bone. Three patients had low-grade malignant tumors (sacral chordomas); one had a sacral radiation-induced necrosis and two senile patients with large sacral defects had chronic renal failure and multiple sclerosis. No comorbidities were found in the sample. RESULT(S): All the lesions were closed successfully. After follow-up of 1 to 8 years, 27 patients never required repeated surgery after wound complications. Three patients had infection and partial dehiscence of the flaps that healed after reoperation with V-Y readvancement; three died as a result of their primary diseases. CONCLUSION(S): This flap design has been used only in selected cases because, after its elevation, use of other gluteal-based flaps for future sacral reconstructions may not be possible. Five neurologically intact patients were found to have good sensitive protection of the flaps and adequate cushion contour after surgery because the authors conserved the gluteal arteries, perforators, and their corresponding sensory nerves. ©2007American Society of Plastic Surgeons.",Excluded
2706,"Robotics in keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted microsurgery: A critical review of existing systems and proposed specifications for new robotic platforms BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, advances in image guidance, endoscopy, and tube-shaft instruments have allowed for the further development of keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted microsurgery, utilizing smaller craniotomies and minimizing exposure and manipulation of unaffected brain tissue. Although such approaches offer the possibility of shorter operating times, reduced morbidity and mortality, and improved longterm outcomes, the technical skills required to perform such surgery are inevitably greater than for traditional open surgical techniques, and they have not been widely adopted by neurosurgeons. Surgical robotics, which has the ability to improve visualization and increase dexterity, therefore has the potential to enhance surgical performance. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the role of surgical robots in keyhole transcranial endoscopeassisted microsurgery. METHOD(S): The technical challenges faced by surgeons utilizing keyhole craniotomies were reviewed, and a thorough appraisal of presently available robotic systems was performed. RESULT(S): Surgical robotic systems have the potential to incorporate advances in augmented reality, stereoendoscopy, and jointed-wrist instruments, and therefore to significantly impact the field of keyhole neurosurgery. To date, over 30 robotic systems have been applied to neurosurgical procedures. The vast majority of these robots are best described as supervisory controlled, and are designed for stereotactic or image-guided surgery. Few telesurgical robots are suitable for keyhole neurosurgical approaches, and none are in widespread clinical use in the field. CONCLUSION(S): New robotic platforms in minimally invasive neurosurgery must possess clear and unambiguous advantages over conventional approaches if they are to achieve significant clinical penetration.

3697,"Soft tissue sarcomas of the popliteal fossa: Outcome and risk factors Background: Limb salvage surgery of popliteal soft tissue sarcomas may be hampered due to the incomplete anatomical containment of this region and the vicinity of neurovascular structures. The scope of this study was to determine outcome and to define risk factors. Patients and Methods: 27 patients (53.3 +/- 15.8 y; 16/27 male) with popliteal soft tissue sarcomas were assessed. Mean follow-up was 40.9 +/- 33.8 months (48.5 +/- 36.7 months in surviving patients). 9/27 patients were included after prior treatment elsewhere (5 after intralesional resections and 4 local recurrences). The lesions were staged IB in 8/27 patients, IIB in 17/27 and III in 2/27. Immediate amputations were performed in 7/27 patients. 15/27 patients were subjected to radiation therapy (preoperative in 6/15 cases), 8/27 patients received chemotherapy (5/8 preoperatively). Result(s): Overall survival and disease-free survival at 5 y was 63.0% and 59.5%. Local recurrence occurred in 2 patients. 8/27 patients developed metastatic disease after 28.9 +/- 9.8 months. Survival (p = 0.397) and disease-free survival (p = 0.113) did not differ in patients after amputations vs limb salvage. Application of radiation therapy was associated with a better survival (p = 0.003). Complications related to the surgical intervention were recorded in 2/27 patients, complications related to radiation therapy occurred in 6/15 patients. Discussion(s): Despite being extra-compartmental, popliteal sarcomas can be treated with a high rate of limb salvage while equal safety compared to amputations is maintained. Irradiation improved survival in our patient population. In cases with involvement of neurovascular structures, preoperative down-staging with radio or chemo-therapy may prevent amputation. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included
2821,"Mechanisms of postspaceflight orthostatic hypotension: Low alpha <inf>1</inf>-adrenergic receptor responses before flight and central autonomic dysregulation postflight Although all astronauts experience symptoms of orthostatic intolerance after short-duration spaceflight, only ~20% actually experience presyncope during upright posture on landing day. The presyncopal group is characterized by low vascular resistance before and after flight and low norepinephrine release during orthostatic stress on landing day. Our purpose was to determine the mechanisms of the differences between presyncopal and nonpresyncopal groups. We studied 23 astronauts 10 days before launch, on landing day, and 3 days after landing. We measured pressor responses to phenylephrine injections; norepinephrine release with tyramine injections; plasma volumes; resting plasma levels of chromogranin A (a marker of sympathetic nerve terminal release), endothelin, dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG, an intracellular metabolite of norepinephrine); and lymphocyte beta<inf>2</inf>-adrenergic receptors. We then measured hemodynamic and neurohumoral responses to upright tilt. Astronauts were separated into two groups according to their ability to complete 10 min of upright tilt on landing day. Compared with astronauts who were not presyncopal on landing day, presyncopal astronauts had 1) significantly smaller pressor responses to phenylephrine both before and after flight; 2) significantly smaller baseline norepinephrine, but significantly greater DHPG levels, on landing day; 3) significantly greater norepinephrine release with tyramine on landing day; and 4) significantly smaller norepinephrine release, but significantly greater epinephrine and arginine vasopressin release, with upright tilt on landing day. These data suggest that the etiology of orthostatic hypotension and presyncope after spaceflight includes low alpha<inf>1</inf>-adrenergic receptor responsiveness before flight and a remodeling of the central nervous system during spaceflight such that sympathetic responses to baroreceptor input become impaired.",Excluded

The frequency of each detected variant was determined in the French population by either a mass spectrometry-based technique or variant-specific endonuclease digestion.RESULTS: Twenty-one ATM missense alterations, at 10 different sites, 8 of which would result in an amino acid substitution at a conserved position in the ATM protein were found. Four were novel changes, three of which were not detected in the 128 French control subjects screened. Eleven of 16 of the individuals with either idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy or juxtafoveolar retinal telangiectasis and 6 of 14 individuals that had choroidal telangiectasis after radiotherapy for AMD carried ATM sequence variants.

2499,"Genetic analysis of dTSPO, an outer mitochondrial membrane protein, reveals its functions in apoptosis, longevity, and Ab42-induced neurodegeneration The outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) protein, the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), formerly named the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), has been proposed to participate in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. To clarify the TSPO function, we identified the Drosophila homolog, CG2789/dTSPO, and studied the effects of its inactivation by P-element insertion, RNAi knockdown, and inhibition by ligands (PK11195, Ro5-4864). Inhibition of dTSPO inhibited wing disk apoptosis in response to gamma-irradiation or H2O2 exposure, as well as extended male fly lifespan and inhibited Abeta42-induced neurodegeneration in association with decreased caspase activation. Therefore, dTSPO is an essential mediator of apoptosis in Drosophila and plays a central role in controlling longevity and neurodegenerative disease, making it a promising drug target.",Excluded
3242,"Dosimetric comparison of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in total scalp irradiation: A single institutional experience Purpose: Total scalp irradiation (TSI) is a rare but challenging indication. We previously reported that non-coplanar intensitymodulated radiotherapy (IMRT) was superior to coplanar IMRT in organ-at-risk (OAR) protection and target dose distribution. This consecutive treatment planning study compared IMRT with volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective treatment plan databank search was performed and 5 patient cases were randomly selected. Cranial imaging was restored from the initial planning computed tomography (CT) and target volumes and OAR were redelineated. For each patients, three treatment plans were calculated (coplanar/non-coplanar IMRT, VMAT; prescribed dose 50 Gy, single dose 2 Gy). Conformity, homogeneity and dose volume histograms were used for plan. Result(s): VMAT featured the lowest monitor units and the sharpest dose gradient (1.6 Gy/mm). Planning target volume (PTV) coverage and homogeneity was better in VMAT (coverage, 0.95; homogeneity index [HI], 0.118) compared to IMRT (coverage, 0.94; HI, 0.119) but coplanar IMRT produced the most conformal plans (conformity index [CI], 0.43). Minimum PTV dose range was 66.8%- 88.4% in coplanar, 77.5%-88.2% in non-coplanar IMRT and 82.8%-90.3% in VMAT. Mean dose to the brain, brain stem, optic system (maximum dose) and lenses were 18.6, 13.2, 9.1, and 5.2 Gy for VMAT, 21.9, 13.4, 14.5, and 6.3 Gy for non-coplanar and 22.8, 16.5, 11.5, and 5.9 Gy for coplanar IMRT. Maximum optic chiasm dose was 7.7, 8.4, and 11.1 Gy (non-coplanar IMRT, VMAT, and coplanar IMRT). Conclusion(s): Target coverage, homogeneity and OAR protection, was slightly superior in VMAT plans which also produced the sharpest dose gradient towards healthy tissue. Copyright © 2016.

2503,"Short-term hazards of low-dose radioiodine ablation therapy in postsurgical thyroid cancer patients During the last two decades, there has been a trend to use low-dose I-131 ablation therapy in patients with thyroid carcinoma without metastases. However, information regarding the incidence of acute adverse reactions in patients after low-dose radioiodine therapy has not been reported. In this study, the acute radiation effects after low-dose radioiodine ablation therapy in postsurgical differentiated thyroid cancer patients was evaluated. Fifty-six patients with differentiated thyroid cancer were prospectively evaluated. None of these patients had evidence of a distant metastasis. All patients received 40 mCi (1480 MBq) I-131 MIBG orally and were evaluated for symptoms and signs by a physician on the second and seventh days after therapy. Xerostomia and nausea were the most common complaints with the same incidence rate of 5.35%. Gastralgia occurred at a frequency of 3.57%. Pain in the thyroid bed, tenderness over a parotid gland, submandibular glands, change in taste, and vomiting all were found at a frequency of 1.78%. Maximum reactions generally occurred 24-48 hours after therapy. All the symptoms except for xerostomia resolved completely in most patients within a week. In comparison with high-dose ablation therapy published in the literature, the incidence of radiation reactions in low-dose radioiodine therapy was much lower. It was concluded that in patients without lymph node or distant metastases, low-dose I-131 MIBG therapy may be recommended to avoid the high incidence of local complications after high-dose treatment.",Excluded

Confluent monolayers of synovial fibroblasts (HIG-82) and neuroblastoma cells (5Y) were exposed in bath solution to 0-75 mA/m(2) (0-56 mV/m), 60 Hz. Single channel conductance, cell membrane current-voltage (I-V) curves, and Ca(2+) influx were measured using the nystatin single and double patch methods. The conductances of the closed and open states of the gap junction channel in HIG-82 cells were each significantly reduced (by 0.76 and 0.39 pA, respectively) in cells exposed to 20 mA/m(2). Current densities as low as 10 mA/m(2) significantly increased Ca(2+) influx in HIG-82 cells. No effects were seen in 5Y cells. The I-V curves of the plasma membranes of both types of cells were independent of 60 Hz electric fields and current densities, 0-75 mA/m(2), indicating that the effect of the 60 Hz fields on GJIC in HIG-82 cells was not mediated by a change in membrane potential. We conclude that ELF electric fields can alter GJIC in synovial cells via a mechanism that does not depend on changes in membrane potential, but may depend on Ca(2+) influx. The results open the possibility that GJIC mediated responses in synovial cells, such as for example, their secretory responses to proinflammatory cytokines, could be antagonized by the application of ELF electric fields.",Excluded

3099,"[Otolaryngological cancer pain at the after-effects stage] The standards of pharyngolaryngeal tumor treatment have changed over the years in an attempt to prevent laryngeal mutilation (partial surgery, endoscopic surgery, sequential radiotherapy, and chemotherapy). Pain induced by these treatments is frequent and varies from one treatment to another. Chemoradiotherapy induces less pain but often more severe pain, since 20% of these situations are not controlled by strong opioids. Pain from mucositis, although nonspecific to otolaryngic cancer, is more frequent and more severe, and prevention and treatment remain poorly defined. Pain from postradiotherapeutic necrosis (mandibula, laryngeal cartilage, etc.) is less frequent, delayed, and extremely severe. Cervical and shoulder pain is present in more than one-third of patients and stems from a number of mechanisms (myofascial and articulatory). It is secondary to radiotherapy or surgery (XIth cranial nerve lesions during curage or flap reconstruction). Finally, pain coexists with disturbances of basic functions (speech, swallowing, etc.) and the disability generated by treatments. Management of pain, suffering, and the psychosocial impact is essential. [References: 34]",Excluded
3225,"Multi cranial neuropathy secondary to primary glioblastoma of trigeminal nerve: Case report Objective: To report a rare case of glioblastoma arising from trigeminal nerve with leptomeningeal spread of disease, and discuss the origin of this tumor. Background(s): Glioblastoma (GB) is a WHO Grade IV tumor typically arising in the supratentorial compartment of the brain. Gliomas arising from cranial nerves (CN) are extremely rare. Design/Methods: A 77 year old gentleman presented with four month history of numbness over the right side of his face and progressive bilateral hearing loss. One week prior to presentation, he also developed left facial weakness, left eye ptosis, diplopia and lower back pain. On examination, he was found to have loss of sensation in a V1-V3 distribution on the right, a left pupil sparing third nerve palsy, bilateral sensironeural hearing loss, and a left peripheral VII CN palsy Results: MRI brain showed a cisternal mass infiltrating the right CN V with extensive enhancement and thickening of bilateral CN including III, V, VII, and VIII. MRI of the spine showed nodular enhancement at the level of the cauda equina. CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells. Biopsy of the right CN V mass showed this to be glioblastoma. Conclusion(s): Leptomeningeal dissemination of glioblastoma is rare, occurring in about 4% of cases. In most of these cases, a parenchymal component is present that eventually disseminates along the ependymal lining of the brain to involve the leptomeninges. We here describe a unique presentation of a GB most likely arising from a CN followed by widespread leptomeningeal dissemination. The root entry zone (either the glial segment or the transition segment) of the cranial nerve is thought to be the anatomical point of origin for gliomas arising from CNs. Unfortunately despite being treated with radiation and chemotherapy, the patient passed away 3 months after presentation denoting the very poor prognosis associated with leptomeningeal spread of GB.",Excluded
2736,"Neurochemical effects of photobiostimulation in the trigeminal ganglion after inferior alveolar nerve injury Orofacial pain is associated with peripheral and central sensitization of trigeminal nociceptive neurons. Nerve injury results in release of chemical mediators that contribute to persistent pain conditions. The activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), promotes release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) from trigeminal nerve terminals. CGRP and SP contribute to the development of peripheral hyperalgesia. The expression of SP and CGRP by primary afferent neurons is rapidly increased in response to peripheral inflammation. CGRP receptor activation promotes activation of AMPA receptors, leading to increased firing of neurons which is reflected as central sensitization. In this study we investigated whether inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) injury influences AMPA receptors, CGRP, SP and TRPV1 expression in the trigeminal ganglion (TG). The relative expression of the protein of interest from naive rats was compared to those from injured rats and animals that received low level laser therapy (LLLT). IAN-injury did not change expression of GluA1, GluA2 and CGRP, but increased the expression of TRPV1 and SP. LLLT increases GluA1 and GluA2 expression and decreases TVPV1, SP and CGRP. These results, together with previous behavioral data, suggest that IAN-injury induced changes in the proteins analyzed, which could impact on nociceptive threshold. These data may help to understand the molecular mechanisms of pain sensitization in the TG.",Excluded

Neural precursors were irradiated with single doses ranging from 0.1 to 4Gy. Cellular death, determined 24 h post-irradiation (pi) was dose-dependent and the induction of apoptosis was confirmed by nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation and hypodiploid DNA peak represented by the ""sub G1"" region. For the higher doses, apoptosis was evident after 4-6 h pi and increased during 24 h. Caspase-3 activity increased with doses and was maximal at 4-6 h pi with 3Gy and remained similar with 4Gy.

3298,"Decreasing temporal lobe dose with five-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy for treatment of pituitary macroadenomas PURPOSE: To compare temporal lobe dose delivered by three pituitary macroadenoma irradiation techniques: three-field three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), three-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (3F IMRT), and a proposed novel alternative of five-field IMRT (5F IMRT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Computed tomography-based external beam radiotherapy planning was performed for 15 pituitary macroadenoma patients treated at New York University between 2002 and 2007 using: 3D-CRT (two lateral, one midline superior anterior oblique [SAO] beams), 3F IMRT (same beam angles), and 5F IMRT (same beam angles with additional right SAO and left SAO beams). Prescription dose was 45 Gy. Target volumes were: gross tumor volume (GTV) = macroadenoma, clinical target volume (CTV) = GTV, and planning target volume = CTV + 0.5 cm. Structure contouring was performed by two radiation oncologists guided by an expert neuroradiologist.RESULTS: Five-field IMRT yielded significantly decreased temporal lobe dose delivery compared with 3D-CRT and 3F IMRT. Temporal lobe sparing with 5F IMRT was most pronounced at intermediate doses: mean V25Gy (% of total temporal lobe volume receiving >=25 Gy) of 13% vs. 28% vs. 29% for right temporal lobe and 14% vs. 29% vs. 30% for left temporal lobe for 5F IMRT, 3D-CRT, and 3F IMRT, respectively (p < 10(-7) for 5F IMRT vs. 3D-CRT and 5F IMRT vs. 3F IMRT). Five-field IMRT plans did not compromise target coverage, exceed normal tissue dose constraints, or increase estimated brain integral dose.CONCLUSIONS: Five-field IMRT irradiation technique results in a statistically significant decrease in the dose to the temporal lobes and may thus help prevent neurocognitive sequelae in irradiated pituitary macroadenoma patients.",Excluded

Calculation of rCBF was performed using the 2-weighted integral (WI) and autoradiographic methods for the 1-compartment analysis, and the 3-WI method was followed for the 2-compartment analysis. Arterial blood radioactivity was counted continuously and corrected for delay and dispersion. The rCBF images were transformed into the Talairach space and analyzed by statistical parametric mapping to identify regional differences in the 2 methods. The values obtained from regions of interest also were compared.RESULTS: Although the difference in global CBF between the 2 models was not significant, rCBF values in the large arteries and neighbor areas were significantly greater in the 2-WI method than in the 3-WI method. However, regional differences in the activation studies were not affected when the 2 methods were compared. The images of cerebral arterial blood volume (V(0)) obtained by the 3-WI method showed a significant increase in V(0) in the visual cortex during visual stimulation.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the rCBF values in the 1-compartment analysis were affected by radioactivity in the vessels. The 3-WI method could provide rCBF values that are less influenced by vascular radioactivity and also show differences in V(0) in PET activation studies.",Excluded

Of the 15 neurological disorders listed, some of which have symptoms of progeria, six - spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy-1, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Down syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - seem to result from increased oxidative stress, and the inability of the base excision repair pathway to handle the damage to DNA that this induces. Five of the conditions (xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne's syndrome, trichothiodystrophy, Down syndrome, and triple-A syndrome) display a defect in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, four (Huntington's disease, various spinocerebellar ataxias, Friedreich's ataxia and myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2) exhibit an unusual expansion of repeat sequences in DNA, and four (ataxia-telangiectasia, ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder, Nijmegen breakage syndrome and Alzheimer's disease) exhibit defects in genes involved in repairing double-strand breaks.

3452,"Indirect measurement of mitochondrial proton leak and its application In mitochondria, ATP synthesis is coupled to oxygen consumption by the proton electrochemical gradient established across the mitochondrial inner membrane in a process termed oxidative phosphorylation. It has long been known from stoichiometric studies that ATP synthesis is not perfectly coupled to oxygen consumption. The major inefficiency in the system is leakage of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane driven by the proton electrochemical gradient. The kinetics of the proton leak can be determined indirectly, by measuring the oxygen consumption of mitochondria under non-phosphorylating conditions (plus oligomycin) as a function of the proton electrochemical gradient. This experimental system provides a convenient means to investigate inner membrane permeability to protons and the effect of factors that may effect that permeability. In this paper we review some results from our laboratory of indirect measurement of mitochondrial proton leak and how it has been applied to investigate the effect of aging, obesity and thyroid status on proton leak. The results show that (i) proton leak in isolated liver mitochondria is not significantly different in a comparison of young and old rats, in contrast (ii) there is an apparent increase in proton leak in in situ mitochondria in hepatocytes from old rats when compared to those from young rats, (iii) proton leak in neuronal mitochondria in situ in synaptosomes is not significantly different in young and old rats, (iv) proton leak is greater in isolated liver mitochondria from ob/ob mice compared to lean controls, (v) acute leptin (OB protein) administration restores the increased leak rate in isolated liver mitochondria from ob/ob mice to that of lean controls, (vi) administration of thyroid hormone (T3) increases proton leak in rat muscle mitochondria, and (vii) proton leak in muscle mitochondria is insensitive to the presence of GDP. It is proposed that the experimental system described here for measuring proton leak, is an ideal functional assay for determining whether the novel uncoupling proteins increase inner membrane permeability to protons.",Excluded

Healthy tissues also receive significant irradiation. Charged amino acids are routinely co-infused to block renal proximal tubular LuTate reabsorption. Gelofusine (a succinylated bovine gelatin molecule), proposed to interact with the megalin/cubulin receptor-mediated transporter system, has been shown to reduce renal uptake of indium-111 octreotide.

Method(s): Retrospective review of 164 ARUBA-eligible patients having stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) from 1990-2005 with more than two years of follow-up. The median patient age was 42.8 years. Sixty-five AVMs (40%) were Spetzler-Martin grade I-II; the median radiosurgery-based AVM score (RBAS) was 1.48. The median follow-up was 67.5 months; 44 patients (27%) had 10 or more years of follow-up. Result(s): Fifteen patients (9%) bled at a median of 21 months (range, 7-70) after SRS. Six patients (4%) had new deficits and 4 patients died (2%). The risk of stroke was 10% at 5-years and 11% at 10-years. Twelve additional patients (7%) had a Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) decline from either radiation-related complications (n=7) or subsequent resection (n=5). The risk of MRS decline was 13% at 5-years and 16% at 10-years. Factors associated with MRS decline were increasing AVM volume (P=0.002), higher AVM grade (P=0.01), and higher RBAS (P=0.002). The 5-year and 10-year risk of MRS decline for patients with Spetzler- Martin grade I-II AVMs or a RBAS less than 1.5 was 5%. Conclusion(s): Although the observed risk of stroke and MRS decline after SRS was similar to the expected risk in the medical management group of ARUBA at the planned follow-up interval of that trial (5-year risk, 5%-20%), younger patients with small, unruptured AVMs may benefit from SRS compared to medical management at longer follow-up periods.",Excluded

The uptake of systemically administered rhodamine-ferritin complex by capillary endothelial cells (CECs) of the cerebral cortex was dependent on power density and on duration of exposure. At 5 mW/cm2, for example, a 15-min exposure had no effect.

2493,"Can a comparison of clinical and deep space irradiation scenarios shed light on the radiation response of the brain? Not surprisingly, our knowledge of the impact of radiation on the brain has evolved considerably. Decades of work have struggled with identifying the critical cellular targets in the brain, the latency of functional change and understanding how irradiation alters the balance between excitatory and inhibitory circuits. Radiation-induced cell kill following clinical fractionation paradigms pointed to both stromal and parenchymal targets but also defined an exquisite sensitivity of neurogenic populations of newly born cells in the brain. It became more and more apparent too, that acute (days) events transpiring after exposure were poorly prognostic of the late (months-years) waves of radiation injury believed to underlie neurocognitive deficits. Much of these gaps in knowledge persisted as NASA became interested in how exposure to much different radiation types, doses and dose rates that characterize the space radiation environment might impair central nervous system functionality, with possibly negative implications for deep space travel. Now emerging evidence from researchers engaged in clinical, translational and environmental radiation sciences have begun to fill these gaps and have uncovered some surprising similarities in the response of the brain to seemingly disparate exposure scenarios. This article highlights many of the commonalities between the vastly different irradiation paradigms that distinguish clinical treatments from occupational exposures in deep space.",Excluded

3489,"A histology-based atlas of the C57BL/6J mouse brain deformably registered to in vivo MRI for localized radiation and surgical targeting The C57BL/6J laboratory mouse is commonly used in neurobiological research. Digital atlases of the C57BL/6J brain have been used for visualization, genetic phenotyping and morphometry, but currently lack the ability to accurately calculate deviations between individual mice. We developed a fully three-dimensional digital atlas of the C57BL/6J brain based on the histology atlas of Paxinos and Franklin (2001 The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates 2nd edn (San Diego, CA: Academic)). The atlas uses triangular meshes to represent the various structures. The atlas structures can be overlaid and deformed to individual mouse MR images. For this study, we selected 18 structures from the histological atlas. Average atlases can be created for any group of mice of interest by calculating the mean three-dimensional positions of corresponding individual mesh vertices. As a validation of the atlas' accuracy, we performed deformable registration of the lateral ventricles to 13 MR brain scans of mice in three age groups: 5, 8 and 9 weeks old. Lateral ventricle structures from individual mice were compared to the corresponding average structures and the original histology structures. We found that the average structures created using our method more accurately represent individual anatomy than histology-based atlases alone, with mean vertex deviations of 0.044 mm versus 0.082 mm for the left lateral ventricle and 0.045 mm versus 0.068 mm for the right lateral ventricle. Our atlas representation gives direct spatial deviations for structures of interest. Our results indicate that MR-deformable histology-based atlases represent an accurate method to obtain accurate morphometric measurements of a population of mice, and that this method may be applied to phenotyping experiments in the future as well as precision targeting of surgical procedures or radiation treatment. © 2009 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",Excluded
3151,"Creation of a multicenter glioblastoma ontology database: A therapy-guided analysis of genotype to phenotype relationships Objective: To create a multicenter glioblastoma ontology database that can be widely utilized within the neurooncology community and which may lead to targeted treatments based on the analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships. Background(s): Glioblastoma remains one of the most lethal human cancers, with median survival of just 12-15 months after surgical debulking, chemotherapy, and radiation. Numerous molecular targets are being explored for the development of novel therapeutics, but efficacy of these new compounds is limited given the lack of personalized utilization based on known genotypic information. Furthermore, the correlation between driver genetic mutations and various phenotypic characteristics that portend poor prognosis are unknown, thereby diminishing the use of potentially effective medications in the sickest patients. Recently, ontological databases have been developed to better detect genotype-phenotype-environment relationships, with the aim of identifying novel substrates or employing known genomic abnormalities for therapeutic development. Design/Methods: This study focuses on the development of a new multicenter glioblastoma ontology database, with the goal to identify key genotypic characteristics that associate with poor prognosis. Patients were enrolled in the study at each site, clinical information was entered retrospectively into a Redcap database, glioblastoma tissue samples were subjected to whole genome analysis, and a clinical ontology was created based on historical information provided. Result(s): The creation of this glioblastoma ontology serves as proof-of-principle for the potential for clinically meaningful hypothesis generation with such an instrument and as a template for other investigators, who can use relationships described in this ontology to analyze information in their own institutional repositories. The ontology described here will be published online and available for public viewing and broad application. Conclusion(s): This glioblastoma ontology will provide a framework to which other investigators can apply their own clinical data and may help to determine high-yield genomic mutations that can be employed for drug development in glioblastoma.",Excluded
2932,"Toward improved target conformity for two spot scanning proton therapy delivery systems using dynamic collimation Purpose: To quantify improvement in target conformity in brain and head and neck tumor treatments resulting from the use of a dynamic collimation system (DCS) with two spot scanning proton therapy delivery systems (universal nozzle, UN, and dedicated nozzle, DN) with median spot sizes of 5.2 and 3.2 mm over a range of energies from 100 to 230 MeV. Method(s): Uncollimated and collimated plans were calculated with both UN and DN beam models implemented within our in-house treatment planning system for five brain and ten head and neck datasets in patients previously treated with spot scanning proton therapy. The prescription dose and beam angles from the clinical plans were used for both the UN and DN plans. The average reduction of the mean dose to the 10-mm ring surrounding the target between the uncollimated and collimated plans was calculated for the UN and the DN. Target conformity was analyzed using the mean dose to 1-mm thickness rings surrounding the target at increasing distances ranging from 1 to 10 mm. Result(s): The average reductions of the 10-mm ring mean dose for the UN and DN plans were 13.7% (95% CI: 11.6%-15.7%; p < 0.0001) and 11.5% (95% CI: 9.5%-13.5%; p < 0.0001) across all brain cases and 7.1% (95% CI: 4.4%-9.8%; p < 0.001) and 6.3% (95% CI: 3.7%-9.0%; p < 0.001), respectively, across all head and neck cases. The collimated UN plans were either more conformal (all brain cases and 60% of the head and neck cases) than or equivalent (40% of the head and neck cases) to the uncollimated DN plans. The collimated DN plans offered the highest conformity. Conclusion(s): The DCS added either to the UN or DN improved the target conformity. The DCS may be of particular interest for sites with UN systems looking for a more economical solution than upgrading the nozzle to improve the target conformity of their spot scanning proton therapy system.

2806,"Expression of markers for pericytes and myofibroblasts in bleomycin (BLEO)-induced dermal fibrosis: Potential role of neuropeptide receptors in a mouse model for scleroderma (SSC) Background: SSc is a chronic collagen-vascular disease that manifests initially with dermal fibrosis, then later progresses to multiple organ fibrosis. There is no treatment to arrest SSc. Recently, a mouse model of SSc was reported, in which Bleo is injected intradermally (ID) for 21-28 days. Two labs showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause this dermal fibrosis. We previously observed that ROS trigger GRP-mediated pulmonary fibrosis to hyperoxia or radiation. We first verified that ROS trigger this dermal fibrosis, and now test the hypothesis that gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) from cutaneous nerves has a role in this process by acting on myofibroblasts [alpha-smooth muscle actin, SMA+] and pericytes [SMA+ and neural/glial antigen 2, NG2+]. We tested expression of both GRP receptors, GRPR and neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) by immunohistochemistry. Design(s): Flanks of 10-wk old C3H/HeJ females were injected ID with Bleo (100-mug) 5d/wk for 3-wks. Some mice also received antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) IP, and other Bleo mice received GRP blocking mAb-2A11. After 21d, lesions paraffin sections were immunostained for SMA, NG2, GRPR, or NMBR. Relative extent of immunostaining in dermis and epidermis was scored by 2 observers (EK & MES) on a scale from 0-3, comparing prevalence of (+) cells (0, 1=detected in few cells, 2=many cells (+), & 3=most cells positive. Result(s): Bleo induced >10-fold increased pericytes & myofibroblasts, in dermis (P<0.001), and NG2 and SMA staining scores were linearly correlated (R<sup>2</sup> = .87, P<0.05). SMA & NG2 were reduced by NAC (~80% decrease, P<0.001) or mAb2A11 (~50% decrease, P<0.01), similar to our prior studies of dermal thickness. Epidermal scores for GRPR were significantly decreased in Bleo+2A11 mice compared to Bleo alone (0.5 +/- 0.3, 1.9 +/- 0.3, P < 0.005), like prior studies of GRPR up-regulation by GRP. However, there were no other differences in GRPR between study groups. NMBR scores were unchanged amongst the groups. Conclusion(s): In the mouse model of scleroderma, increased pericytes and myofibroblasts occur in regions of dermal fibrosis. Although GRPR &/or NMBR could contribute to Bleo-induced dermal fibrosis their expression is unchanged between groups. We previously determined that GRP induces GRPR gene expression. Regardless, sustained epidermal expression of both receptors would be consistent with potential GRP signaling in epidermis as a mechanism for epidermal hyperplasia and dermal fibrosis, such as through epithelial-mesenchymal transformation.",Excluded
3611,"Thalamic energy dysregulation drives microstructural changes of thalamocortical projections in multiple sclerosis Background and aims: Neuronal energy dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS) has been proposed as a key driver of axonal degeneration. Diffusion-weighted 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DW-MRS) can measure the diffusivity of creatine-phosphocreatine (Cr/PhCr), whose reduction in the MS thalamus has been proposed to reflect limited energy reserves. We tested in-vivo whether thalamic energy dysregulation is associated with microstructural degeneration of its projection tracts in MS. Method(s): Seventeen patients and thirteen healthy controls (HCs) underwent 3T MRI scan including DW-MRS and DW sequences. From DW-MRS, Cr apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(tCr)) was extracted in the bilateral thalami. Thalamic projections to somatosensory, dorsolateral prefrontal cortexes and optic radiations (case tracts) and the arcuate (non-thalamic control tract) were manually drawn in TrackVis (Fig.1). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), reflecting microstructural damage, were extracted for each tract. Associations between ADC(tCr) and microstructural parameters were tested using linear mixed-effect models. (Figure presented) Results: In MS, lower thalamic ADC(tCr) was associated with lower mean FA and higher mean MD of pooled thalamo-cortical tracts after adjusting for disease duration, gender and tract-specific lesion load (p=0.033 and p=0.047). No correlation was found in HCs. Unadjusted tract-by-tract analysis confirmed the correlation between thalamic ADC(tCr) and MD in patients. The arcuate tract, not connected to the thalamus, showed no correlation (Fig.2). (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): Thalamic ADC(tCr) was associated with specific microstructural damage of thalamo-cortical tracts in MS, suggesting that energy dysfunction in this crucial hub - through an impaired Cr/PhCr transport/utilization - may disrupt thalamo-cortical networks by inducing the selective anterograde degeneration of connected fibers.",Excluded

2420,"Acrylamide neuropathy. III. Spatiotemporal characteristics of nerve cell damage in forebrain Previous studies of acrylamide (ACR) neuropathy in rat PNS [Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. (1998) 151:211-221] and in spinal cord, brainstem and cerebellum [NeuroToxicology (2002a) 23:397-414; NeuroToxicology (2002b) 23:415-429] have suggested that axon degeneration was not a primary effect and was, therefore, of unclear neurotoxicological significance. To conclude our studies of neurodegeneration in rat CNS during ACR neurotoxicity, a cupric silver stain method was used to define spatiotemporal characteristics of nerve cell body, dendrite, axon and terminal argyrophilia in forebrain regions and nuclei. Rats were exposed to ACR at a dose-rate of either 50 mg/kg per day (i.p.) or 21 mg/kg per day (p.o.) and at selected times brains were removed and processed for silver staining. Results show that intoxication at either ACR dose-rate produced a terminalopathy, i.e. nerve terminal degeneration and swelling were present in the absence of significant argyrophilic changes in neuronal cell bodies, dendrites or axons. Exposure to the higher ACR dose-rate caused early onset (day 5), widespread nerve terminal degeneration in most of the major forebrain areas, e.g. cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus and basal ganglia. At the lower dose-rate, nerve terminal degeneration in the forebrain developed early (day 7) but exhibited a relatively limited spatial distribution, i.e. anteroventral thalamic nucleus and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. Several hippocampal regions were affected at a later time point (day 28), i.e. CA1 field and subicular complex. At both dose-rates, argyrophilic changes in forebrain nerve terminals developed prior to the onset of significant gait abnormalities. Thus, in forebrain, ACR intoxication produced a pure terminalopathy that developed prior to the onset of significant neurological changes and progressed as a function of exposure. Neither dose-rate used in this study was associated with axon degeneration in any forebrain region. Our findings indicate that nerve terminals were selectively affected in forebrain areas and, therefore, might be primary sites of ACR action.",Excluded
3069,"Plant polyphenols inhibit functional amyloid and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas strains by directing monomers to off-pathway oligomers Self-assembly of proteins to beta-sheet rich amyloid fibrils is commonly observed in various neurodegenerative diseases. However, amyloid also occurs in the extracellular matrix of bacterial biofilm, which protects bacteria from environmental stress and antibiotics. Many Pseudomonas strains produce functional amyloid where the main component is the highly fibrillation-prone protein FapC. FapC fibrillation may be inhibited by small molecules such as plant polyphenols, which are already known to inhibit formation of pathogenic amyloid, but the mechanism and biological impact of inhibition is unclear. Here, we elucidate how polyphenols modify the self-assembly of functional amyloid, with particular focus on epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), penta-O-galloyl-beta-d-glucose (PGG), baicalein, oleuropein, and procyanidin B2. We find EGCG and PGG to be the best inhibitors. These compounds inhibit amyloid formation by redirecting the aggregation of FapC monomers into oligomeric species, which according to small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements organize into core-shell complexes of short axis diameters 25-26 nm consisting of ~7 monomers. Using peptide arrays, we identify EGCG-binding sites in FapC's linker regions, C and N-terminal parts, and high amyloidogenic sequences located in the R2 and R3 repeats. We correlate our biophysical observations to biological impact by demonstrating that the extent of amyloid inhibition by the different inhibitors correlated with their ability to reduce biofilm, highlighting the potential of anti-amyloid polyphenols as therapeutic agents against biofilm infections.

3344,"Cognitive dysfunction in patients with pituitary tumour who have been treated with transfrontal or transsphenoidal surgery or medication OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to examine the neuropsychological status of patients treated for pituitary tumour by transfrontal surgery, transphenoidal surgery or medical treatment only, with or without radiotherapy.DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: Three groups of 23 patients who had been treated for pituitary tumour were compared with 23 healthy controls on a range of neuropsychological measures. The surgical patients were also subdivided into two groups and compared. The neuropsychological measures were standardized psychological tests designed to assess aspects of attention, memory and executive function.PATIENTS: The patients were those who had been treated with transfrontal surgery (n = 23), transsphenoidal surgery (n = 23) and medication only (n = 23). The groups did not differ with respect to age, education or premorbid ability level as assessed by the National Adult Reading Test. All participants were free of known sources of cognitive impairment other than pituitary tumour.RESULTS: Comparison of the four groups revealed that nearly half of the transfrontal, one-third of the transsphenoidal and one-quarter of the non-surgical group had three or more neuropsychological tests scores below the 10th percentile compared to less than 5% of the controls. Impairments in memory and executive function were found in both surgical groups. The non-surgical patients appeared to have problems only on tasks requiring high levels of cognitive processing. Differences were found between the two surgical groups with respect to the severity of the cognitive impairment, the transfrontal patients having more severe impairment than the transsphenoidal. No significant negative effects on cognitive functioning were associated with radiotherapy; however, transfrontal surgery patients who had not been treated with radiotherapy were found to be more impaired than other patients. This was thought to be related to radical surgery.CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with treated pituitary tumour suffer significant cognitive impairment. The severity and nature of impairment differs between treatment groups, although the cause of this could not be addressed by this study. Recommendations are made for future research and clinical practice.",Excluded
3618,"Inhibition of IKK/NF-kappaB impairs glioma stem cell function Glioma, the most frequently occurring primary brain tumor, has a median survival of less than 15 months, despite multimodal treatment combining surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. It has been suggested that the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) within these tumors are responsible for resistance to treatment and high probability of recurrence. As a result, there is increasing interest in specifically targeting CSCs with new therapies to improve treatment of this disease. NF-kappaB has been implicated in numerous forms of cancer, as its target genes regulate hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. Both glioma cell lines and tumor samples show high levels of phosphorylated p65, a marker of NF-kappaB activation. When comparing populations from tumor explants, NF-kappaB is preferentially activated in the CSC subset. We are examining the effects of IKK/NF-kappaB inhibition on both heterogeneous glioma explants and purified (CD133+) CSCs from these explants. Inhibition of NF-kappaB through either genetic or pharmacological means abrogates neurosphere formation, an in vitro measure of stem cell function. Additionally, real-time PCR analysis indicates that inhibition of NF-kappaB leads to a decrease in target genes implicated in glioma CSC biology, such as A20 and IL-6. We have also studied our glioma explants in both subcutaneous and intracranial xenografts to examine the role of NF-kappaB in vivo. We are utilizing microarrays to define the NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression signature in CD133+ cells. Our studies indicate a significant role for the NF-kappaB pathway in the biology of glioma CSCs, with possible parallels in CSCs of other tumor types.",Excluded

The network learns an end-to-end mapping between low (thick-slice thickness) and high (thin-slice thickness) resolution images using the modified U-Net. To verify the proposed method, we train and test the CNN using axially averaged data of existing thin-slice CT images as input and their middle slice as the label. Fifty-two CT studies are used as the CNN training set, and 13 CT studies are used as the test set. We perform five-fold cross-validation to confirm the performance consistency. Because all input and output images are used in two-dimensional slice format, the total number of slices for training the CNN is 7670. We assess the performance of the proposed method with respect to the resolution and contrast, as well as the noise properties. The CNN generates output images that are virtually equivalent to the ground truth. The most remarkable image-recovery improvement by the CNN is deblurring of boundaries of bone structures and air cavities. The CNN output yields an approximately 10% higher peak signal-to-noise ratio and lower normalized root mean square error than the input (thicker slices). The CNN output noise level is lower than the ground truth and equivalent to the iterative image reconstruction result.

2433,"Sonic Hedgehog signaling impairs ionizing radiation-induced checkpoint activation and induces genomic instability The Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway plays important roles in embryogenesis, stem cell maintenance, tissue repair, and tumorigenesis. Haploinsufficiency of Patched-1, a gene that encodes a repressor of the Shh pathway, dysregulates the Shh pathway and increases genomic instability and the development of spontaneous and ionizing radiation (IR)-induced tumors by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that Ptc1(+/-) mice have a defect in the IR-induced activation of the ATR-Chk1 checkpoint signaling pathway. Likewise, transient expression of Gli1, a downstream target of Shh signaling, disrupts Chk1 activation in human cells by preventing the interaction of Chk1 with Claspin, a Chk1 adaptor protein that is required for Chk1 activation. These results suggest that inappropriate Shh pathway activation promotes tumorigenesis by disabling a key signaling pathway that helps maintain genomic stability and inhibits tumorigenesis.",Excluded

METHOD(S): In 27 patients with suspected newly diagnosed or recurrent primary malignant parenchymal brain tumors a single intravenous injection of talaporfin sodium (40 mg/m2) was administered one day before surgical resection of the neoplasm. Next day after completion of the tumor removal the residual lesion and/or resection cavity were irradiated with 664-nmsemiconductor laser with a radiation power density of 150 mW/cm2 and radiation energy density of 27 J/cm2. The procedure was performed at 22-27 hours after drug administration. The study cohort included 22 patients with histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of primary malignant parenchymal brain tumor. Thirteen of these neoplasms (59%) were newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). RESULT(S): Among all 22 patients included into study cohort the 12-month overall survival (OS), 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), and 6-months local PFS rates after surgery and PDT were 95.5%, 91%, and 91%, respectively. Among patients with newly diagnosed GBM all these parameters were 100%. Side effects on the skin, which could be attributable to administration of talaporfin sodium, were noted in 7% of patients and included rush (2 cases), blister (1 case), and erythema (1 case). Skin photosensitivity test results were relatively mild and fully disappeared within 15 days after administration of photosensitizer in all patients. CONCLUSION(S): Intraoperative PDT using talaporfin sodium and semiconductor laser may be considered as potentially effective and sufficiently safe option for adjuvant management of primary malignant parenchymal brain tumors.

3152,"Radiosurgery for re-irradiation of brain metastasis: Results in 54 patients Purpose: To evaluate in terms of probabilities of local-regional control and survival, as well as of treatment-related toxicity, results of radiosurgery for brain metastasis arising in previously irradiated territory. Patients and Methods: Between January 1994 and March 2000, 54 consecutive patients presenting with 97 metastases relapsing after whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. Median interval between the end of WBRT and radiosurgery was 9 months (range 2-70). Median age was 53 years (24-80), and median Karnofski performance status (KPS) 70 (60-100). Forty-seven patients had one radiosurgery, five had two and two had three. Median metastasis diameter and volume were 21 mm (6-59) and 1.2 cc (0.1-95.2), respectively. A Leksell stereotactic head frame (Leksell Model G, Elektra, Instrument, Tucker, GA) was applied under local anesthesia. Irradiation was delivered by a gantry mounted linear accelerator (linacs) (Saturne, General Electric). Median minimal dose delivered to the gross disease was 16.2 Gy (11.8-23), and median maximal dose 21.2 Gy (14- 42). Result(s): Median follow-up was 9 months (1-57). Five metastases recurred. One- and 2-year metastasis local control rates were 91.3 and 84% and 1- and 2-year brain control rates were 65 and 57%, respectively. Six patients died of brain metastasis evolution, and three of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. One- and 2-year overall survival rates were 31 and 28%, respectively. According to univariate analysis, KPS, RPA class, SIR score and interval between WBRT and radiosurgery were prognostic factors of overall survival and brain free-disease survival. According to multivariate analysis, RPA was an independent factor of overall survival and brain free-disease survival, and the interval between WBRT and radiosurgery longer than 14 months was associated with longer brain free-disease survival. Side effects were minimal, with only two cases of headaches and two of grade 2 alopecia. Conclusion(s): Salvage radiosurgery of metastasis recurring after whole brain irradiation is an effective and accurate treatment which could be proposed to patients with a KPS > 70 and a primary tumour controlled or indolent. We recommend that a dose not exceeding 14 Gy should be delivered to an isodose representing 70% of the maximal dose since local control observed rate was similar to that previously published in literature with upper dose and side effects were minimal. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",Excluded

A median prescription dose of 75 Gy (range: 70-80 Gy) was delivered to the involved trigeminal nerve root entry zone. Treatment outcomes were assessed through patient self-reports of pain control and medication usage during follow-up visits. In addition, patients responded to a standard questionnaire containing the Barrow Neurologic Institute Pain Scale (BNI) and selected sections of the McGill Pain Scale. Treatment outcomes and objective quality of life measures were also addressed.RESULTS: Ninety-six patients (86%) completed questionnaires for a median follow-up of 30 months (range: 8-66 months). Seventy-four patients (77%) reported pain relief occurring after a median of 3 weeks (range: 0-24 weeks) after GKRS. A decrease in medication usage was noted in 66% of patients. Actuarial analysis demonstrated 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year recurrence rates of 23%, 33%, and 39%, respectively. Response to treatment was associated with lack of prior surgical treatment (p = 0.03) and less than 50 months' pain duration before GKRS (p = 0.04). Patients who described their TN pain as more severe than their worst non-TN headache pain (McGill Pain Scale IV-V vs. I-III) were also more likely to respond to treatment (p < 0.001). Seven (7.3%) patients reported new or increased trigeminal dysfunction; however, only 3.1% reported these symptoms as bothersome (BNI III-IV). Patients with sustained pain relief reported an average of 100% improvement in their QOL as a direct result of pain relief after GKRS, and 100% believed that the procedure was successful. Furthermore, among those patients with temporary pain relief and subsequent recurrence, 65% felt their treatment was a success with an average of 80% improvement in their QOL.CONCLUSIONS: GKRS provides significant pain relief and improves QOL in the majority of patients treated for TN, with few bothersome side effects. Patients with both temporary and sustained responses to treatment realized significant improvements in QOL after GKRS, and considered their treatment successful. Longer follow-up of these patients may reveal additional recurrences highlighting the importance of studies evaluating repeat GKRS and optimization of current treatment techniques and patient selection.",Excluded
3195,"UV-visible antagonism in extraocular photosensitive neurons of the anthomedusa, Spirocodon saltatrix (Tilesius) Attempts were made to identify extraocular photosensitive cells in the subtentacular region (the area between the ocelli and the nerve ring) and around the inner-nerve ring of the anthomedusan Spirocodon saltatrix. Irradiation with ultraviolet light (UV) led to inhibition of spontaneous impulses and after UV-off, an afterinhibition which lasted for a few minutes. This afterinhibition was rapidly overcome by exposure to visible light (VIS). UV-VIS antagonism of this type was identified in six different impulse systems monitored in extracellular recordings. Intracellular recordings from two of the six cell types showed that UV irradiation causes hyperpolarization which inhibits spontaneous activity. The other cell types showed no membrane potential changes during UV irradiation even though the cells' spontaneous outputs were inhibited. It was concluded that the photosensitivity lies in three kinds of nerves which are distributed widely through the subtentacular region and the nerve ring.",Excluded

2839,"[Changes of EEG coherence in different stages of the formation of the psychoorganic syndrome] The group of liquidators of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident (n=170) with nonpsychotic mental disorders of exogenic-organic origin was studied. Patients were stratified into five groups on the basis of dominating symptoms in different stages of disorders: group 1 included patients with the prevalence of asthenic symptoms (n=104); group 2 - with the prevalence of autonomous disorders (n=37); group 3 - with the marked neurotic-like symptom complex (n=10); group 4 - with depressive symptoms (n=10); group 5 - with disturbances of cognitive function. The control group included 150 healthy people. Recording and mapping of coherence (COH) of the brain electrical activity was conducted using the apparatus-software complex for topographic mapping of brain electrical activity NEURO-CM (Russia) with the bandwidth from 0 to 40 Hz and the time constant of 0.3 sec. The EEG record was carried out monopolar from symmetrical cortical zones (10-20% scheme). Changes of COH were characterized by staging in patients compared to the controls. In the initial stage of disease, the integrative links were decreased in the temporal cortical zones of the left hemisphere. The reduction of functional activity in temporal-central cortical zones was found that might be the consequence of mesodiencephalic dysfunction. In the later stages, temporal zones of the right hemisphere were mostly affected. The parallel reinforcement of functional activity of occipital zones, in particular, the increase of 'long links' with frontal areas, was noted in the overall formation of the psychoorganic syndrome. This phenomenon may be considered as a compensatory mechanism when the phylogenetically older cortical zones, which are more resistant to pathological changes, become leaders in the realization of integrative brain activity during the development of a pathological state.",Included
2933,"Relationship between volume, dose and local control in stereotactic radiosurgery of brain metastasis The aim of this study is to analyse the efficacy of linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on prognostic factors, local control rate and survival in patients with brain metastasis. Patients with either a single metastasis or up to 4 multiple brain metastases with a maximum tumour diameter of 40 mm for each tumour and a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) > or = 70 were eligible for SRS. SRS was applied to 150 lesions in 86 consecutive patients with a median age of 60 years (median 1 and mean 1.7 lesions per patient, mean KPS 86). Median overall survival was 6.2 months after SRS and 9.7 months from diagnosis of brain metastasis. Multivariate analysis revealed that a KPS of 90 or more (p = 0.009) and female sex (p = 0.003) were associated with a longer survival. Radiation dose < or = 15 Gy (p = 0.017) and KPS < 90 (p = 0.013) were independent predictors of a shorter time to local failure. Five patients showed evidence of radionecrosis with a median survival of 14.8 months. Addition of WBRT neither led to improvement of survival nor to improvement of local control. Improved local control following SRS for brain metastases was associated with KPS > or =90, a radiation dose > 15 Gy and a PTV < 13 cc. The potential of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for brain metastases of larger volume warrants further study.",Excluded
2700,"Brain enzyme histochemistry following stabilization by microwave irradiation The activities of various enzymes present in brain homogenates were assayed biochemically (a) with no pretreatment, (b) following a standard microwave treatment in saline and (c) after a standard microwave treatment in formalin. All enzyme activity was lost after the microwave - formalin in treatment. Following microwave - saline treatment, the activities of alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, isocitrate and succinate dehydrogenases were reduced. In contrast, the activities of lactate and malate dehydrogenases were unchanged, and that of acetylcholinesterase apparently increased. Analogous outcomes were seen following attempted histochemical demonstrations of these enzymes. Thus satisfactory histochemical demonstration of all enzymes was achieved (except with alkaline phosphatase, lactate and malate dehydrogenases) following the microwave-saline pretreatment. Since acid phosphatase, catalase and peroxidase were also successfully demonstrated, it seems that microwave-saline pretreatments permit both retention of sufficient enzyme activity for histochemical demonstration to occur and retention of sufficient structural integrity for critical morphological investigations. Since the failure to stain the sites of lactate and malate dehydrogenases is not due to microwave inactivation of these enzymes, their demonstration may be possible by varying the staining procedures.",Excluded
2601,"Optical Imaging of Beta-Amyloid Plaques in Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial, irreversible, and incurable neurodegenerative disease. The main pathological feature of AD is the deposition of misfolded beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) plaques in the brain. The abnormal accumulation of Abeta plaques leads to the loss of some neuron functions, further causing the neuron entanglement and the corresponding functional damage, which has a great impact on memory and cognitive functions. Hence, studying the accumulation mechanism of Abeta in the brain and its effect on other tissues is of great significance for the early diagnosis of AD. The current clinical studies of Abeta accumulation mainly rely on medical imaging techniques, which have some deficiencies in sensitivity and specificity. Optical imaging has recently become a research hotspot in the medical field and clinical applications, manifesting noninvasiveness, high sensitivity, absence of ionizing radiation, high contrast, and spatial resolution. Moreover, it is now emerging as a promising tool for the diagnosis and study of Abeta buildup. This review focuses on the application of the optical imaging technique for the determination of Abeta plaques in AD research. In addition, recent advances and key operational applications are discussed.",Excluded

2430,"Selective 5-HT receptor inhibition of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic activity in the rat dorsal and median raphe The dorsal (DR) and median (MR) raphe nuclei contain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) cell bodies that give rise to the majority of the ascending 5-HT projections to the forebrain. The DR and MR have differential roles in mediating stress, anxiety and depression. Glutamate and GABA activity sculpt putative 5-HT neuronal firing and 5-HT release in a seemingly differential manner in the MR and DR, yet isolated glutamate and GABA activity within the DR and MR has not been systematically characterized. Visualized whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques were used to record excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSC and IPSC) in 5-HT-containing neurons. There was a regional variation in action potential-dependent (spontaneous) and basal [miniature (m)] glutamate and GABAergic activity. mEPSC activity was greater than mIPSC activity in the DR, whereas in the MR the mIPSC activity was greater. These differences in EPSC and IPSC frequency indicate that glutamatergic and GABAergic input have distinct cytoarchitectures in the DR and MR. 5-HT(1B) receptor activation decreased mEPSC frequency in the DR and the MR, but selectively inhibited mIPSC activity only in the MR. This finding, in concert with its previously described function as an autoreceptor, suggests that 5-HT(1B) receptors influence the ascending 5-HT system through multiple mechanisms. The disparity in organization and integration of glutamatergic and GABAergic input to DR and MR neurons and their regulation by 5-HT(1B) receptors may contribute to the distinction in MR and DR regulation of forebrain regions and their differential function in the aetiology and pharmacological treatment of psychiatric disease states.",Excluded

We developed an instrument to estimate survival of elderly patients with brain metastasis from gynecological cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 15 patients, whole-brain radiotherapy regimen, tumor site, age, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), number of brain metastases, extra-cerebral metastases and interval from diagnosis of gynecological cancer until radiotherapy were retrospectively evaluated for survival. Characteristics found significant on multivariate analysis were used for the instrument.RESULTS: In the multivariate analysis, KPS >=70% (hazard ratio=3.71, p=0.0499) and an interval >=28 months (hazard ratio=3.71, p=0.030) were significantly associated with better survival. Based on these characteristics, patients received 0 (n=6), 1 (n=3) or 2 points (n=6).

2708,"Impact of prenatal stress on amygdala anatomy in young adulthood: Timing and location matter BACKGROUND: Exposure to maternal stress in utero has long-term implications for the developing brain and has been linked with a higher risk of depression. The amygdala, which develops during the early embryonic stage and is critical for emotion processing, might be particularly sensitive.METHODS: Using data from a neuroimaging follow-up of the ELSPAC prenatal birth cohort (n=129, 47% men, 23-24 years old), we studied the impact of prenatal stress during the first and second half of pregnancy on the volume of the amygdala and its nuclei in young adult offspring. We further evaluated the relationship between amygdala anatomy and offspring depressive symptomatology. Amygdala nuclei were parcellated using FreeSurfer's automated segmentation pipeline. Depressive symptoms were measured via self-report using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).RESULTS: Exposure to stress during the first half of pregnancy was associated with smaller accessory basal (Cohen's f<sup>2</sup>=0.27, p(FDR)=0.03) and cortical (Cohen's f<sup>2</sup>=0.29, p(FDR)=0.03) nuclei volumes. This effect remained significant after correcting for sex, stress during the second half of pregnancy, as well as maternal age at birth, birth weight, maternal education, and offspring's age at MRI. These two nuclei showed a quadratic relationship with BDI scores in young adulthood, where both smaller and larger volume was associated with more depressive symptoms (Accessory basal nucleus: Adj R<sup>2</sup>=0.05. p(FDR)=0.015; Cortical nucleus: Adj R<sup>2</sup>=0.04, p(FDR)=0.015).CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that exposure to stress during the first half of pregnancy might have long-term implications for amygdala anatomy, which may in turn predict the experience of depressive symptoms in young adulthood.",Excluded
3002,"Experimental and preclinical tools to explore the main neurological impacts of brain irradiation: Current insights and perspectives Radiation therapy is a powerful tool in the treatment of primary and metastatic cancers of the brain. However, brain tissue tolerance is limited, and radiation doses must be tailored to minimize deleterious effects on the nervous system. Due to improved treatments, including radiotherapy techniques, many patients with brain tumors survive longer, but they experience late effects of radiotherapy, especially cognitive decline, for which no efficient treatment is currently available. Improving the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced neurological defects first needs to better characterize radiation injuries in brain cells and tissues. Rodent models have been widely used for this. Here, observations from patients will be reviewed briefly as an introduction, mainly regarding clinical cognitive defects and anatomical alterations using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This limited descriptive clinical knowledge addresses many questions that arise in preclinical models regarding understanding the mechanism of radiation-induced brain dysfunction. From this perspective, we next present methods to characterize radiation-induced neurogenesis alterations in adult mice and then detail how MRI could be used as a powerful tool to explore these alterations.

Based on these results, we have explored the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian oscillation and phase response to light of the master clock located in the dorsomedial subdivision of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and found various proteins closely related to phase response such as BIT/SHPS-1 and those of circadian oscillation, some of which are involved in protein-tyrosine phosphorylation.On the other hand, we have presented several lines of evidence that the ventrolateral subdivision of the SCN includes not only the control center of energy supply to the brain, but also that of homeostasis such as blood glucose, blood pressure, water balance, and body temperature. We have also shown that besides these functions, the latter subdivision is involved in the regulations of hormone secretions such as insulin, glucagon, corticosterone and vasopressin. It has been also shown by electrophysiological means that light exposure to rat eye enhances sympathetic nerve activity, whereas it depresses parasympathetic nerve activity. Thus, environmental light is implicated not only in the phase-shift through the retinohypthalamic tract (RHT), but also control of autonomic nerve activities through the RHT, It is also discussed in this review how the two divisions are interconnected and how environmental light is involved in this interconnection.

We sought to characterize the effect of loss of EWM-mediated ChBF regulation on photoreceptor health in pigeons housed in either moderate intensity diurnal or constant light (CL). Photoreceptor abundance following complete EWM destruction was compared to that following a lesion in the pupil control circuit (as a control for spread of EWM lesions to the nearby pupil-controlling lateral EW) or following no EW damage. Birds were housed post-lesion in a 12 h 400 lux light/12 h dark light cycle for up to 16.5 months, or in constant 400 lux light for up to 3 weeks. Paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde fixed eyes were embedded in plastic, sectioned, slide-mounted, and stained with toluidine blue/azure II. Blinded analysis of photoreceptor outer segment abundance was performed, with outer segment types distinguished by oil droplet tint and laminar position. Brains were examined histologically to assess lesion accuracy. Disruption of pupil control had no adverse effect on photoreceptor outer segment abundance in either diurnal light or CL, but EWM destruction led to 50-60% loss of blue/violet cone outer segments in both light conditions, and a 42% loss of principal cone outer segments in CL. The findings indicate that adaptive regulation of ChBF by the EWM circuit plays a role in maintaining photoreceptor health and mitigates the harmful effect of light on photoreceptors, especially short wavelength-sensitive cone photoreceptors.",Excluded

Relevant stenosis was defined as diameter reduction > or =50%. During CTA, arrhythmias were present in 42 (30%) patients who were not excluded from the analysis.RESULTS: The assessment of stenosis or occlusion of bypass grafts resulted in a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 97%, and positive and negative predictive values of 93% and of 99%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy for the detection of graft occlusion or stenosis did not differ between arterial and venous grafts. The evaluability of bypass grafts was significantly lower in patients with arrhythmias or with heart rates > or =65 beats/min during scanning.

The autophagic pathway is stimulated by nutrient starvation, which prompted us to study the desert camel. Various organs of the camel undergo ecological and physiological stress due to food and water deprivation, dehydration and long exposure to solar radiation. We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of specific biomarkers of autophagy under normal conditions as a baseline for later work on stressed individuals. The autophagy-specific biomarkers, microtubule-associated protein1 light chain 3 (LC3), and its cleaved variant, LC3B, were strongly expressed in the cytosol of all tissues examined. The cytosolic immunoreactivity of LC3 was relatively weak, diffuse and vacuolar, while that of LC3B was stronger, punctate and at lower levels. LC3 appears to be associated with the autophagosomal membranes, either free or lysosome-bounded. LC3B is specific for the autophagosome-lysosome complexes and their degraded, granular contents. Autophagy was strongly expressed in CNS neurons and intestinal neural elements, which suggests a protective function for the nervous system. Autophagic markers also were seen in deformed immune-competent cells with fragmented nuclei in lymph nodes, spleen and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which suggests a ""suicidal"" activity of eliminating unneeded cells.

[French] Purpose of the study: In order to investigate the role of radiosurgery and stereotactic radiotherapy in the management of vestibular schwannomas, we have reviewed our own prospective cohort and the main series of the modern literature. Patients and Methods: Between July 14th 1992 and June 1st 2011, 2991 vestibular schwannomas were operated on the Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery Department of Timone University Hospital. All the patients have been evaluated prospectively, with a follow up longer than 3 years for 2336 patients, excluding patients suffering from type 2 neurofibromatosis (148 patients). In 7% of the patients, the vestibular schwannoma had previously been resected. According to Koos classification, in 17.6% of the patients, vestibular schwannomas were stage I, 51.8% stage II, 27% stage III and 3.6% stage IV. The mean tumour volume was 2.63 cm<sup>3</sup>. According to Garner Robertson classification, the hearing was still functional at the time of radiosurgery in 46% and subnormal in 20.9% of the patients. Result(s): Long term tumour control was achieved in 97.5% of the patients. A transient facial palsy was observed in 0.5% of the cases. The rate of trigeminal injury was 0.5%. Useful hearing was preserved at 3 years in 78%. This rate reached 95% in patients with no past history of sudden hearing loss. Other predictors of functional hearing preservation are the young age, the small size of the lesion and a dose to the modiulus of the cochlea lower than 4. Gy. We observed no radio-induced tumour. Only large, Koos IV vestibular schwannomas are contraindicated for upfront radiosurgery. In these patients, we propose a combined approach with a deliberately partial microsurgical removal, followed by a radiosurgery of the residue. Conclusion(s): This cohort is unique by the size of the population and the length of the follow up and results demonstrate the efficacy of radiosurgery and its safety, especially its high rate of hearing preservation. © 2012 Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique (SFRO).",Excluded

3359,"Clinical correlates of true progression versus treatment effect in brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery Purpose: A substantial proportion of brain metastases treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) will subsequently grow on imaging, though often transiently. Optimal clinical management in such cases is hampered by an inability to reliably distinguish true progression (TP) from pseudoprogression with conventional imaging. Identifying clinical features associated with TP may aid clinical decision making. Methodology: Patients treated with SRS for brain metastases who subsequently underwent resection of treated lesions at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical and radiation planning features were fitted into a multivariate logistic regression model to identify significant relationships with pure TP on pathology. Result(s): Seventy-five cases of treated brain metastases across 60 patients (median age: 57 years) met our inclusion criteria (Table 1). Prescribed dose range was 14-25 Gy in 1-5 fractions prescribed to 50-90% isodose line (IDL) with corresponding BED10 of 28-60Gy. Median time from SRS to subsequent resection was 255 days (range: 21-1351). Pathology showed pure TP in 39/75 surgical specimens (52%). Clinical covariates were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model with poorest predictors removed in step-wise fashion. Factors removed due to lesser significance (p > 0.3) included treatment machine, time from SRS, and radiation dose in BED10. For the final multivariate model, statistically significant predictors included small cell lung cancer (SCLC) pathology, infratentorial location, and increasing IDL (Table 2). (Table presented) Conclusion(s): SCLC histology, infratentorial location, and higher prescription IDL predicted for TP while prior WBRT showed a trend for predicting treatment effect in this institutional cohort. These data suggest that SCLC or infratentorial location may reflect a higher probability for local microscopic spread and marginal miss with SRS. The more gradual dose fall off and less centrally ablative dose associated with higher prescription IDLs also seemto correlate with lower rates of radionecrosis and increased odds of progression in this cohort.

2417,"Potential Improvements in Brain Dose Estimates For Internal Emitters BACKGROUND: Element-specific biokinetic models are used to reconstruct doses to systemic tissues from internal emitters. Typically, a systemic model for a radionuclide explicitly depicts only its dominant repositories. Remaining tissues and fluids are aggregated into a pool called Other tissue in which the radionuclide is assumed to be uniformly distributed. In the systemic biokinetic models used in radiation protection, the brain usually is addressed as an implicit mass fraction of Other tissue rather than an explicitly depicted repository. Due to increasing interest in radiation effects on the brain, efforts are underway to improve brain dosimetry for internal radiation sources.METHODS: We assessed potential improvements in brain dosimetry for internal emitters by explicitly modelling brain kinetics rather than treating the brain as a mass fraction of Other tissue. We selected ten elements for which brain kinetics can be modeled using published biokinetic data. Injection dose coefficients were calculated for a relatively long-lived radioisotope of each element using each of two versions of the ICRP's latest systemic biokinetic model for each element, the original version and a modified version differing only in the treatment of brain. If the ICRP model contained an explicit brain pool, the modified version depicted brain instead as a mass fraction of Other tissue. If the ICRP model included brain in Other tissue, the modified version included an explicit brain pool with kinetics based on best available brain-specific data.RESULTS: The result for a given radionuclide is expressed as a ratio A:B, where A and B are the dose coefficients based on the versions of the model with and without an explicit brain pool, respectively. The following ratios A:B were obtained for the 10 radionuclides addressed here: 241Am, 0.13; 207Bi, 0.57; 234U, 0.81; 239Pu, 0.96; 203Hg (vapor), 1.4; 134Cs, 1.5; 54Mn, 1.7; 210Po, 1.7; 226Ra, 1.9; 210Pb, 3.3. These ratios indicate that a dose estimate for brain based on a biokinetic model with brain implicitly contained in Other tissue may substantially underestimate or substantially overestimate a dose estimate that reflects best available brain-specific biokinetic data. Of course, the reliability of the latter estimate depends on the quality of the underlying biokinetic data.CONCLUSIONS: Where feasible, the brain should be depicted explicitly in biokinetic models used in epidemiological studies addressing adverse effects of ionizing radiation.",Excluded

3045,"The white 'matter' in obsessive compulsive disorder: Effect of pharmacological treatment and symptom dimensions models Background: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is highly heterogeneous in its manifestations, both across patients and within the same patient over time. The disorder is probably best described by a multidimensional model involving several symptom dimensions, whose precise number and phenotypes are debated. This heterogeneity partly explains, beyond methodological discrepancies, the inconsistency of results in current brain imaging research in the disorder, particularly in diffusion tensor imaging studies. Purpose(s): We aimed at investigating white matter (WM) alterations associated with OCD, controlling for the impact of variables known to affect WM structure, and specifically for the effect of current and lifetime pharmacological treatment. Then, we tested two different symptom dimensions models [1,2] within OCD patients, analysing theirWMcorrelates, for both prevailing current symptom dimension and symptom dimension at onset. Method(s): We compared 58 adult pure-OCD patients and 58 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC), with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics on diffusion tensor images, using TFCE correction (p = 0.05). With respect to symptom dimensions, separate analyses were carried on the sole OCD sample. The diffusion measures Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Axial Diffusivity (AD), Radial Diffusivity (RD) and Mean Diffusivity (MD) were used as parameters of WM organisation. Result(s): The observed differences between OCD patients and HC were totally carried by the effect of previous and current medications. No differences were in fact observed between drugna ive patients and HC. Current medication was associated with a widespread decrease of FA and increase of RD throughout the whole brain. Lifetime treatment was associated with a decrease in FA in the tracts surrounding the thalami, site of major neurotransmitter alteration in OCD. In the analysis of symptom dimensions, only a finer-grained five-factors model [2] allowed for the identification of specific neural correlates. Patients having current Symmetry/Perfectionism dimension show a reduction in RD and MD in the body of corpus callosum and in left higher-order visual association tracts, including: left uncinate fasciculus, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus and/or inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and left superior longitudinal fasciculus. Furthermore, patients having Doubt/Checking dimension at onset show a widespread reduction of AD, encompassing corpus callosum, and bilaterally the thalamic radiations, internal capsule, cingulum, corona radiata and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Finally, patients having Rituals/Superstition dimension at onset show an increase in FA in the cortico-striato-thalamic circuits: genu of corpus callosum, bilateral posterior limb of the internal capsule, bilateral anterior thalamic radiations and left external capsule. Conclusion(s): Present results confirm the effect of medications on WM in OCD [3], showing a large effect of current treatment on myelination and a site-specific, disorder-specific, effect of medications on brain systems. Furthermore, our findings provide support to a multidimensional model of OCD, and indicate that the distinction of clinically homogeneous dimensions is essential for the identification of reliable neural correlates. Finally, we evidence, to our knowledge for the first time, that onset symptom dimensions are associated with enduring alterations of WM structure. Onset symptom dimensions may reflect underlying endophenotypes, and our results suggest their relevance for future investigations on OCD neuroanatomy and aetiopathology.",Excluded

2508,"Pyruvate kinase and aspartate-glutamate carrier distributions reveal key metabolic links between neurons and glia in retina Symbiotic relationships between neurons and glia must adapt to structures, functions, and metabolic roles of the tissues they are in. We show here that Muller glia in retinas have specific enzyme deficiencies that can enhance their ability to synthesize Gln. The metabolic cost of these deficiencies is that they impair the Muller cell's ability to metabolize Glc. We show here that the cells can compensate for this deficiency by using metabolites produced by neurons. Muller glia are deficient for pyruvate kinase (PK) and for aspartate/glutamate carrier 1 (AGC1), a key component of the malate-aspartate shuttle. In contrast, photoreceptor neurons express AGC1 and the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase, which is commonly associated with aerobic glycolysis in tumors, proliferating cells, and some other cell types. Our findings reveal a previously unidentified type of metabolic relationship between neurons and glia. Muller glia compensate for their unique metabolic adaptations by using lactate and aspartate from neurons as surrogates for their missing PK and AGC1.",Excluded

Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, highly aggressive neuroendocrine cutaneous neoplasm which is often located in the head and neck district. This carcinoma has the same characteristics as small cell tumors and tends to significant metastatization both through the lymph nodes and through the blood. It is also prone to frequent recurrence. Today diagnosis is facilitated by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry to search for neurofilaments and cytocheratin 20. The treatment of choice is radical surgery ensuring a tumor-free edge of at least 3 cm, associated with supplementary local radiotherapy. Recurrence is quite frequent despite the treatment strategies applied.",Excluded

This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of surgically treated PCMs larger than 2 cm.METHODS: A series of 199 consecutive patients (137 females, 68.8 %) with PCMs larger than 2 cm from between 1993 and 2003 were included. The clinical charts, radiographs, and follow-ups were evaluated.RESULTS: Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 111 (55.8 %) patients, subtotal resection (STR) in 65, and partial resection (PR) in 23. Cranial nerve dysfunctions were the most common complications and occurred in 133 (66.8 %) cases. The surgical mortality was 2.0 %. The Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores significantly decreased 1 month after the operations (preoperative KPS = 76.8 and postoperative KPS = 64.8; p = 0.011, Paired-samples t test). Long-term follow-ups were obtained in 142 patients, the follow-up duration was 171.6 months, and the most recent KPS was 83.2. Permanent morbidities remained in 24 patients (18.9 %). Multivariate analysis revealed that brainstem edema and tumors larger than 4 cm in diameter were independent risk factors in terms of outcomes (KPS < 80). The recurrence/progression rates were 14.5, 31.8, and 53.3 % for the GTR, STR, and PR cases, respectively (p = 0.002, Pearson chi (2) test). Gamma Knife radiosurgery for the remnants exhibited good tumor control.CONCLUSIONS: Favorable outcomes and low mortality were achieved with the microsurgical management of medium and large PCMs; however, the rates of cranial nerves dysfunction remained high. Radically aggressive resection might not be judicious in terms of postoperative morbidity. The preoperative evaluations and intraoperative findings were informative regarding the outcomes. The low follow-up rate likely compromised our findings, and additional consecutive studies were required.",Excluded

The effects of gamma thalamotomy for parkinsonian and other kinds of tremor were evaluated. Methods. Thirty-six thalamotomies were performed in 31 patients by using a 4-mm collimator. The maximum dose was 150 Gy in the initial six cases, which was reduced to 130 Gy thereafter. The longest follow-up period was 6 years. The target was determined on T<inf>2</inf>-weighted and proton magnetic resonance (MR) images. The point chosen was in the lateral-most part of the thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus. This is in keeping with open thalamotomy as practiced at the authors' institution. In 15 cases, gamma thalamotomy was the first surgical procedure. In other cases, previous therapeutic or vascular lesions were visible to facilitate targeting. Two types of tissue reaction were onserved on MR imaging: a simple oval shape and a complex irregular shape. Neither of these changes affected the clinical course. In the majority of cases, the tremor subsided after a latent interval of approximately 1 year after irradiation. The earliest response was demonstrated at 3 months. In five cases the tremor remained. In four of these cases, a second radiation session was administered. One of these four patients as well as another patient with an unsatisfactory result underwent open thalamotomy with microrecording. In both cases, depth recording adjacent to the necrotic area revealed normal neuronal activity, including the rhythmic discharge of tremor. Minor coagulation was performed and resulted in immediate and complete arrest of the remaining tremor. Conclusions. Gamma thalamotomy for Parkinson's disease seems to be an alternative useful method in selected cases.",Excluded

[Russian] Wistar rats were exposed to 10, 20 and 40 sGy of gamma-irradiation. Maximal activity of 2-oxoglutarate- and succinate dehydrogenases, as well as of aspartate-2-oxoglutarate and pyruvate-2-oxoglutarate in the brain tissue was measured within 30 days after the exposure. Dehydrogenase activity was measured in the brain cortex, limbic system and in the cerebellum; transaminase activity was determined in the brain cortex, diencephalic zone and in the hypophysis. It was found that small doses of irradiation resulted in an oscillating increase of dehydrogenase activity with a decrease of the amplitude by the 30th day of the experiment. As the dose of irradiation increases, the periods of normal activity change into phases of inhibition of dehydrogenase action, the period of oscillations diminishes. Transaminase activity, as a rule, changes in a phase in a reversible manner as compared with dehydrogenase activity. These observations are discussed from the point of view of structural relations between these two systems in the intramitochondrial supramolecular structures, the so-called metabolons.",Included

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is often beneficial in such cases providing improved survival of patients, but still remains underutilized as part of the multimodality management of malignant gliomas. During the last 20 years, 297 patients with histologically proven residual or recurrent GBM underwent Gamma Knife surgery in the University of Pittsburgh. Retrospective analysis of outcomes revealed median survival after initial diagnosis of 18 months, and 1- and 2-year survival rates of 72.5 and 29.5%, respectively. Median survival from the time of SRS was 9 months. The use of modified RPA (recursive partitioning analysis) classification demonstrated superior survival in our series in comparison with historical data. Important prognostic variables include tumor volume <14 cm3, marginal radiation dose of >=15 Gy, and younger age of the patients (<60 years). Adverse radiation effects (ARE) were noted in 23% of cases and were mainly controlled with corticosteroids.

3060,"The effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation over the cerebellum on the synkinesis of coordinated eye and head movements We made a study of coordinated saccadic eye and head movements following random and predictable horizontal visual targets by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the cerebellum before the start of the gaze movement. We have found three effects of TMS on eye/head movements under these conditions. SACCADIC LATENCY-EFFECT: When stimulation took place shortly before movements commenced, significantly shorter latencies were found between target presentation and commencement of saccades: For predictable, to a lesser extent for random targets and TMS up to 75 ms before start of the saccade, latencies were significantly decreased when compared with no application of TMS. Without stimulation, latencies to random targets were within a range of 120-200 ms. EYE-HEAD INTERACTION-EFFECT: Without TMS, for amplitudes greater than 25 degrees, head movements usually preceded eye movements, as expected, especially for predictive responses. With the application of TMS shortly after the target display, the number of eye movements which preceded head movements, was significantly increased (p<0.001), and the delay between eye and head movements was reduced or reversed (p<0.001), compared with gaze movements without the use of TMS. SACCADIC PEAK VELOCITY-EFFECT: Applying transcranial magnetic stimulation at 5-25 ms after the position change of the 60 degrees target, and 50-5 s before the start of eye movement, mean peak velocity of synkinetic saccades increased up to 600 degrees/s, compared with 350-400 degrees/s without the use of TMS.

Six MeV electrons were used for intraoperative irradiation, and external beam irradiation was done using photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. The psoas muscle in the irradiation field was examined histomorphometrically 2 or 5 years after irradiation. The percentage of muscle fibers and capillaries decreased, whereas the percentage of connective tissue increased with increased dose for both intraoperative irradiation only and intraoperative irradiation plus external beam irradiation. The dose causing a 50% decrease in the percentage of muscle fibers was 21.2 Gy and 33.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone, and 22.9 Gy and 25.2 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. The ED50 for severe vessel lesions was 19.2 Gy and 25.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone and 16.0 Gy and 18.0 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. External beam irradiation alone caused a slight decrease in percentage of muscle fibers with increased dose, and vessel lesions were infrequent or mild. Radiation-induced muscle injury was characterized by loss of muscle fibers, decreased fiber size, severe vessel lesions, hemorrhage, inflammation, coagulation necrosis, and fibrosis. These histopathologic characteristics distinguish this muscle injury from that caused by neurogenic atrophy. These data indicate that radiation-induced muscle injury most likely was caused by injury of the supporting vasculature. The lesions produced were largely a function of the single intraoperative dose rather than the external beam fractionated doses. Furthermore, it appears that 20 to 25 Gy intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation may be near the maximum tolerated dose by sublumbar musculature and its supporting vasculature.",Included

We therefore hypothesized that specific white matter tracts would be associated with poorer prognosis based on their connection to primitive brain regions necessary for essential life functions. We also hypothesized that tumors in these regions treated with bevacizumab would alter patient survival. METHOD(S): 109 subjects with primary GBM tumors were retrospectively included in this study. Voxel-wise survival analyses were performed to test for spatial and treatment dependence of GBM survival prognosis. An intersection analysis was first performed between an enhancing tumor mask and template-space diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived tractography which highlighted voxels with tumor-intersecting white matter tracts. Maps of voxels with these tracts were made for each patient. A voxel-wise Kaplan-Meier test was performed comparing the survival times of patients with and without a tumor-intersecting white matter tract in that voxel. The same analysis was implemented to compare survival of participants with and without bevacizumab. This highlighted regions where survival was effected due to anti-VEGF treatment. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to validate the observed survival differences induced by bevacizumab considering inconsistencies in treatment regimens seen in the patient population. RESULT(S): Glioblastoma patients with tumors intersecting the right anterior thalamic radiation, right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, bilateral corticospinal tracts, and corpus callosum have decreased survival compared to those with tumors intersecting elsewhere. Patients treated with bevacizumab and who also had tumors intersecting the corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, or the thalamic radiations were found to be at a survival advantage when compared to those who did not receive bevacizumab.

Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging was used to evaluate longitudinal brain white matter tract changes in NPC patients. The relationships between RT-related white matter changes, hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive impairment were also assessed.RESULTS: Bilateral cingulate angular bundle (CAB) fibers had progressive diffusion reduction [radial diffusivity (RD) and mean diffusivity] over time (P < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) in NPC patients during the first year after RT. RT-associated progressive RD reduction in the left CAB correlated with longitudinal atrophy of the ipsilateral hippocampus (P = 0.033). Additionally, RT-associated progressive RD reduction in the left CAB correlated with progressive cognitive impairment in NPC patients post-RT (P = 0.048).CONCLUSION: We present evidence of progressive RT-associated changes in the bilateral CAB in NPC patients, which may underlie RT-related cognitive impairment.

Thirteen patients previously had undergone surgery (range, 1-6 resections). Four patients had multiple cranial nerve deficits before microsurgical resection; 12 developed multiple lower cranial nerve palsies after resection. Four patients underwent radiosurgery based on imaging criteria alone. Conformal dose planning (tumor margin dose of 12-18 Gy) successfully encompassed the irregular tumor volumes in all patients.RESULTS: Follow-up varied from 6 to 74 months. Tumor size decreased in eight patients, remained stable in eight, and increased in one patient during the average follow-up interval of 3.5 years. Six patients improved and 10 others retained their preradiosurgery clinical status. One patient had an increase in tumor size and clinical deterioration 6 months after radiosurgery and underwent microsurgical resection.

Almost half of them (10/21) had already been treated and presented during relapse. In all cases dedicated MR, CT and MET-PET were scheduled before treatment and performed according to standard procedures. GTV was outlined on CT images fused to MR (GTV-MRI/CT), on MET-PET positive regions only (GTV-PET), and final volumes were calculated by using PET/CT/MRI coregistered images. Optimal radiation dose required was 60Gy. In 7 patients a contemporary Chemo/radiotherapy regimen was administered. The mean observational period was 6months, up to 22months. In 13 patients a postradiotherapy evaluation was performed and of these we calculated PFS and OS. In 3 patients progression/relapse was defined within 7 months, whereas other 3 patients deceased within 2 months. Statistical analysis was performed on clinical and instrumental data in order to define correlation and prognostic value of different parameters. Result(s): in19 out of 21 patients a GTV-PET could be defined (mean 18,3cc), which in 14 cases (73,7%) determined a modification of the GTVMRI/ CT (mean 58.79cc). Malignant lesions presented a SUV<inf>max</inf>=3.37 (range1.60- 5.17) and a SUVratio(SUV<inf>max</inf>/SUVnormal)=2.43 (range1.53-3.26).

Excess occurrence after radiotherapy was observed for pain in the breast or in the skin, reported to occur ""occasionally"" by 38.1% of survivors having undergone radiotherapy and surgery versus 24.0% of those with surgery alone (absolute difference 14.1%; p=0.004) and at least once a week by 10.3% of the radiotherapy group versus 1.7% (absolute difference 8.6%; p=0.001). Daily life and analgesic use did not differ between the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Ten to 17 years after postoperative radiotherapy 1 in 12 women had weekly pain that could be attributed to radiotherapy. The symptoms did not significantly affect daily life and thus the reduced risk for local recurrence seems to outweigh the risk for long-term symptoms for most women.",Included

2404,"Acute remapping within the motor system induced by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of human primary motor cortex (M1) changes cortical excitability at the site of stimulation and at distant sites without affecting simple motor performance. The aim of this study was to explore how rTMS changes regional excitability and how the motor system compensates for these changes. Using functional brain imaging, activation was mapped at rest and during freely selected finger movements after 30 min of 1 Hz rTMS. rTMS increased synaptic activity in the stimulated left M1 and induced widespread changes in activity throughout areas engaged by the task. In particular, movement-related activity in the premotor cortex of the nonstimulated hemisphere increased after 1 Hz rTMS. Analyses of effective connectivity confirmed that the stimulated part of M1 became less responsive to input from premotor and mesial motor areas. Conversely, after rTMS our results were consistent with increased coupling between an inferomedial portion of left M1 and anterior motor areas. These results are important for three reasons. First, they show changes in motor excitability to central inputs from other cortical areas (as opposed to peripheral or exogenous inputs used in previous studies). Second, they suggest that maintenance of task performance may involve activation of premotor areas contralateral to the site of rTMS, similar to that seen in stroke patients. Third, changes in motor activations at the site of rTMS suggest an rTMS-induced remodeling of motor representations during movement. This remapping may provide a neural substrate for acute compensatory plasticity of the motor system in response to focal lesions such as stroke.",Excluded

We investigated multiple pretreatment PET metrics, including SUV<inf>max</inf>, mean SUV (SUV<inf>mean</inf>), total lesion glycolysis, and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) in LS-SCLC patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and correlated them with survival and disease control outcomes. Patients and Methods All patients received platinum-based chemotherapy and a median radiation dose of 45 Gy. Kaplan-Meier and competing-risks analyses were performed to assess the prognostic value of PET metrics with respect to overall survival (OS), distant failure (DF), disease-free survival (DFS), and locoregional failure (LRF). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to account for the effect of other clinical factors on outcomes. Results A total of 120 patients with LS-SCLC had analyzable pre-CRT PET/CTs. The median follow up was 34 months. Median OS was 26.9 months. OS was 53.2% at 2 years and 33.1% at 5 years. SUV<inf>max</inf>, SUV<inf>mean</inf>, MTV, and total lesion glycolysis of the primary tumor were not significantly associated with OS, LRF, and DFS on univariate analysis. MTV was significantly associated with DF (P =.024) on univariate but not multivariate analysis. Conclusion This is the largest reported series to date evaluating the prognostic value of baseline PET metrics in LS-SCLC. Neither SUV<inf>max</inf> nor other analyzed PET metrics demonstrated significant correlation with OS or LRF. MTV was correlated with DF and DFS, but this association was no longer significant after adjustment for other clinical factors. This analysis suggests that pretreatment PET scans, even with the use of advanced metrics, do not have independent prognostic value for outcomes in LS-SCLC patients after CRT.

2805,"The association between white matter abnormalities and processing speed deficits in bipolar disorder Background: Abnormality of white matter (WM) integrity, as measured by fractional anisotrophy (FA) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), has been observed in bipolar disorder (BD). However, few studies have examined the relationship of FA with cognitive performance in BD. We used DTI to examine regional differences in FA between BD and healthy comparison (HC) participants and the relationship with processing speed and switching abilities within regions of aberrant WM integrity. Method(s): 20 medicated euthymic BD (age=44.6+/-2.1yrs) and 20 HC (age=45.3+/-1.8yrs) participants completed neuropsychological tests of processing speed and switching (D-KEFS Trailmaking) and a 51-direction DTI scan. FA was calculated and tract-based spatial statistics were used to identify common WM tracts. Group differences were examined with independent-samples T-tests. Within significantly different regions, the association of FA with cognitive performance was examined in each group separately. Result(s): BD patients had lower FA within seven WM regions, including clusters in bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and left anterior thalamic radiation, and exhibited mildly slower processing speed. Among BD patients, lower FA values within left inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus was associated with slower processing speed. There were no significant associations among HC subjects or for switching performance in either group. Conclusion(s): Consistent with the literature, BD patients demonstrated abnormal WM integrity, primarily in the longitudinal fasciculus, and this deficit was most pronounced among BD patients with the slowest processing speed. These findings suggest that BD processing speed deficits may be due to abnormal WM integrity in the longitudinal fasciculus.",Excluded
2869,"Cochlear-implant high pulse rate and narrow electrode configuration impair transmission of temporal information to the auditory cortex In the most commonly used cochlear prosthesis systems, temporal features of sound are signaled by amplitude modulation of constant-rate pulse trains. Several convincing arguments predict that speech reception should be optimized by use of pulse rates > or approximately 2,000 pulses per second (pps) and by use of intracochlear electrode configurations that produce restricted current spread (e.g., bipolar rather than monopolar configurations). Neither of those predictions has been borne out in consistent improvements in speech reception. Neurons in the auditory cortex of anesthetized guinea pigs phase lock to the envelope of sine-modulated electric pulse trains presented through a cochlear implant. The present study used that animal model to quantify the effects of carrier pulse rate, electrode configuration, current level, and modulator wave shape on transmission of temporal information from a cochlear implant to the auditory cortex. Modulation sensitivity was computed using a signal-detection analysis of cortical phase-locking vector strengths. Increasing carrier pulse rate in 1-octave steps from 254 to 4,069 pps resulted in systematic decreases in sensitivity. Comparison of sine- versus square-wave modulator waveforms demonstrated that some, but not all, of the loss of modulation sensitivity at high pulse rates was a result of the decreasing size of pulse-to-pulse current steps at the higher rates. Use of a narrow bipolar electrode configuration, compared with the monopolar configuration, produced a marked decrease in modulation sensitivity. Results from this animal model suggest explanations for the failure of high pulse rates and/or bipolar electrode configurations to produce hoped-for improvements in speech reception.",Excluded

It may be produced by a desk-top method developed previously for 186Re(Sn)HEDP using 188Re produced through neutron irradiation of either enriched 187Re or naturally occurring rhenium targets or the use of a 188W/188Re generator.RESULTS: So long as the mass of rhenium in the 188Re-perrhenate to be processed into 188Re(Sn)HEDP is at least 100 microg, satisfactory radiochemical yields and purity may be obtained by all methods. The 188Re(Sn)HEDP has biodistribution and radiation dosimetry characteristics that are similar to those noted previously for 186Re(Sn)HEDP and appears to result in similar benefits and toxicities in patients with skeletal metastases. External radiation exposure monitoring indicates that, only 4 hr after a therapeutic administration of 1110 MBq (30 mCi) of 188Re(Sn)HEDP, average exposure rates at 1 meter from the patient would be only 0.5 mR/hr.CONCLUSION: Same-day, on-demand, outpatient therapy of disseminated skeletal metastases appears to be feasible with 188Re(Sn)HEDP.",Excluded

This radiotracer displayed good brain penetration (3.1% of the injected dose (ID) in whole brain at 15 min post-radioligand injection). Radioligand distribution was consistent with the density of high affinity nAChRs with highest uptake observed in the nAChR-rich thalamus (14.9 %ID/g at 60 min), moderate uptake in cortex (8.5 %ID/g at 60 min), and lowest uptake in the cerebellum (2.4 %ID/g at 60 min). Pretreatment with several different nAChR agonists (A-85380, (-)-nicotine, cytisine) significantly inhibited [I-125]-5-IA binding in all brain regions studied (P < 0.01) demonstrating the high specificity of the radioligand for nAChRs. Blocking doses of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine and the non-competitive nAChR channel blocker mecamylamine had no significant effect on radioactive uptake supporting the in vitro selectivity of [I-125]-5-IA for the nAChR component of the cholinergic system.

3559,"Patterning the cone mosaic array in zebrafish retina requires specification of ultraviolet-sensitive cones Cone photoreceptors in teleost fish are organized in precise, crystalline arrays in the epithelial plane of the retina. In zebrafish, four distinct morphological/spectral cone types occupy specific, invariant positions within a regular lattice. The cone lattice is aligned orthogonal and parallel to circumference of the retinal hemisphere: it emerges as cones generated in a germinal zone at the retinal periphery are incorporated as single-cell columns into the cone lattice. Genetic disruption of the transcription factor Tbx2b eliminates most of the cone subtype maximally sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths and also perturbs the long-range organization of the cone lattice. In the tbx2b mutant, the other three cone types (red, green, and blue cones) are specified in the correct proportion, differentiate normally, and acquire normal, planar polarized adhesive interactions mediated by Crumbs 2a and Crumbs 2b. Quantitative image analysis of cell adjacency revealed that the cones in the tbx2b mutant primarily have two nearest neighbors and align in single-cell-wide column fragments that are separated by rod photoreceptors. Some UV cones differentiate at the dorsal retinal margin in the tbx2b mutant, although they are severely dysmorphic and are eventually eliminated. Incorporating loss of UV cones during formation of cone columns at the margin into our previously published mathematical model of zebrafish cone mosaic formation (which uses bidirectional interactions between planar cell polarity proteins and anisotropic mechanical stresses in the plane of the retinal epithelium to generate regular columns of cones parallel to the margin) reproduces many features of the pattern disruptions seen in the tbx2b mutant.",Excluded

3499,"Multiple cone pathways are involved in photic regulation of retinal dopamine Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in the retina and plays a central role in the light adaptive processes of the visual system. The sole source of retinal dopamine is dopaminergic amacrine cells (DACs). We and others have previously demonstrated that DACs are activated by rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) upon illumination. However, it is still not clear how each class of photosensitive cells generates light responses in DACs. We genetically isolated cone function in mice to specifically examine the cone-mediated responses of DACs and their neural pathways. In addition to the reported excitatory input to DACs from light-increment (ON) bipolar cells, we found that cones alternatively signal to DACs via a retrograde signalling pathway from ipRGCs. Cones also produce ON and light-decrement (OFF) inhibitory responses in DACs, which are mediated by other amacrine cells, likely driven by type 1 and type 2/3a OFF bipolar cells, respectively. Dye injections indicated that DACs had similar morphological profiles with or without ON/OFF inhibition.

This inhibition could impair motor function of the affected hand. We investigated if inhibitory 1~Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the contralesional M1 improved motor performance of the affected hand in acute stroke.METHODS: A double-blind study of real versus placebo rTMS was conducted. Twelve patients early after subcortical stroke (mean: 7 days) received 1200 stimuli of real and placebo rTMS in a crossover design. The sequence of stimulations was counterbalanced across subjects. Stimulus intensity was subthreshold (90% of motor threshold at rest). Motor function was tested by grip strength recordings and Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT) executions before and after each rTMS session.RESULTS: Compared to sham stimulation, real rTMS improved NHPT results but not grip strength in the affected hand. No change of performance was observed for the unaffected hand. NHPT baseline repetitions in a subgroup of patients indicated stable motor performance prior to the rTMS sessions.CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that therapeutic rTMS applications over the contralesional hemisphere are feasible in acute stroke patients and can transiently improve dexterity of the affected hand.

However, the evolutional processes of RT-induced cortical injury have not been sufficiently investigated. This study investigates RT-induced effects on cortical morphology using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in NPC patients.Methods: Using MRI-based morphometry with surface-based measures, we evaluated the longitudinal alterations of cortical volume (CV), cortical thickness (CT), and cortical surface area (CSA) in 104 NPC patients at pre-RT (n=104), within 3 months post-RT (n=92), 6 months post-RT (n=71), and 9-12 months post-RT (n=52). Twenty healthy controls were also evaluated in parallel. Linear mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories of RT-related changes in cortical brain morphology and its association with irradiation dose, with healthy controls data being used to construct a normal age-related benchmark. The level of statistical significance was set at P<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons.Results: The results showed that RT-related longitudinal alterations in cortical morphology underwent two diverse patterns during the first year of follow up in NPC patients. The temporal cortices (including the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole, parahippocampal and fusiform gyrus, and the right inferior temporal and right transverse temporal gyrus), the basal occipital cortices (the right lingual gyrus and lateral occipital gyrus), and the basal frontal cortices (the right lateral orbitofrontal gyrus) showed time-dependent attenuation in cortical morphology indices. Furthermore, these effects on multiple cortices were dose-dependent, suggesting they were RT-associated. In contrast, in the left rostral middle frontal gyrus, there was a time-dependent increase in CT.Conclusions: Our preliminary findings revealed divergent effects of irradiation on cortical brain morphology. These results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of irradiation-related neurotoxic effects on cortical brain morphology and will help guide the investigation of critically neuroprotective strategies.",Included

Evidence of sensory reinterpretation is manifested as postflight modifications of eye/head coordination, locomotor patterns, postural control strategies, and illusory perceptions of self or surround motion in conjunction with head movements. Under normal preflight conditions, the head is stabilized during locomotion, but immediately postflight reduced head stability, coupled with inappropriate eye/head coordination, results in modifications of gait. Postflight postural control exhibits increased dependence on vision which compensates for inappropriate interpretation of otolith and proprioceptive inputs. Eye movements compensatory for perceived self motion, rather than actual head movements have been observed postflight.

In this work, we sought to investigate whether COLLAGE measurements from posttreatment gadolinium-contrast T1WI could distinguish varying extents of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor classes in a lesion across primary and metastatic brain tumors.MATERIALS AND METHODS: On a total of 75 gadolinium-contrast T1WI studies obtained from patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the extent of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor in every brain lesion was histopathologically defined by an expert neuropathologist as the following: 1) ""pure"" cerebral radiation necrosis; 2) ""mixed"" pathology with coexistence of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumors; 3) ""predominant"" (>80%) cerebral radiation necrosis; 4) predominant (>80%) recurrent tumor; and 5) pure tumor. COLLAGE features were extracted from the expert-annotated ROIs on MR imaging. Statistical comparisons of COLLAGE measurements using first-order statistics were performed across pure, mixed, and predominant pathologies of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.RESULTS: COLLAGE features exhibited decreased skewness for patients with pure (0.15 +/- 0.12) and predominant cerebral radiation necrosis (0.25 +/- 0.09) and were statistically significantly different (P < .05) from those in patients with predominant recurrent tumors, which had highly skewed (0.42 +/- 0.21) COLLAGE values. COLLAGE values for the mixed pathology studies were found to lie between predominant cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor categories.CONCLUSIONS: With additional independent multisite validation, COLLAGE measurements might enable noninvasive characterization of the degree of recurrent tumor or cerebral radiation necrosis in gadolinium-contrast T1WI of posttreatment lesions.",Excluded
3430,"Physics of surgery with lasers The characteristics of the principal lasers used in surgery are summarized in Table 1. Their diverse effects on biologic tissues permit the following generalizations: The CO2 laser is best suited for precise, visually controllable tissue removal by vaporization with minimal marginal damage. Hemostasis is excellent for bleeding from capillary vessels, but difficult for larger ones. The Nd:YAG laser is best suited for the coagulation of larger tissue volumes of the order of 10 mm3 or more. Tissue heating inherently extends for several millimeters, leading to excellent hemostasis. Radiation from this laser is well transmitted through flexible optical fibers and clear fluids. The argon ion laser emits radiation in the visible range and is ideally suited for treating the retina and other tissues in the eye without damage to its transparent structures. Radiation of this laser is strongly absorbed by pigmented tissues, scattered and reflected by others, and transmitted by fluids. Its radiation can be focused to very small spot sizes, leading to high precision and high-power densities. It has hemostatic properties intermediate between those of the CO2 and of the Nd:YAG laser radiations. It is well transmitted through optical fibers and clear fluids. It is used extensively in ophthalmology and dermatology. Selected applications to neurosurgery and otology are being investigated. These lasers have become indispensable adjuncts to the surgical armamentarium of several specialties. The very success of these lasers is leading to a critical examination of their shortcomings and to a search for improved systems. Examples are (1) the ongoing search for optical fibers to transmit the radiation of the CO2 laser; (2) the development of systems for the sequential delivery to tissues of several wavelengths from a single unit (Fig. 14); and (3) investigations of tissue effects of laser beams in the ultraviolet and in the infrared at wavelengths intermediate between those of the Nd:YAG and CO2 lasers. The use of lasers has already contributed to improved medical care in many surgical disciplines. Additional areas of application can be confidently anticipated.",Excluded

3429,"[Rules of application and mode of action of transcranial direct current stimulation in neurorehabilitation: primary motor cortex] Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an emerging technique of non-invasive brain stimulation that has been found useful in facilitating treatment of various neurological disorders, especially stroke. Currently available criteria for single application of several minutes-long stimulation at 1-2 mA have been considered safe. However, knowledge regarding safety parameters of repeated and long-term electrical stimulation is so far limited. Studies on the use of tDCS focus predominantly on the motor cortex. They demonstrate that weak direct current is capable of eliciting cortical excitability changes which occur during and after stimulation. The nature of these changes is specific for current polarity - anodal stimulation enhances excitability, and cathodal reduces it. Studies indicate that tDCS effects are generated by polarity-driven alterations of membrane potentials and efficacy modulations of specific neuronal receptors. According to interhemispheric competition models, possible mechanisms underlying functional improvements due to stimulation in patients with stroke are attributed to tDCS-induced modification of inappropriate interhemispheric inhibition.

Four animals had clinical and radiological evidence of GBM, and two animals had no evidence of GBM at the time of euthanization. Tumor precursor cells were identified diffusely scattered in the grossly normal white matter of all animals including two monkeys without evidence of GBM by MR-imaging or on autopsy examination. Tumor precursors demonstrated cellular atypia and mitoses, and were negative for tumor-associated markers GFAP, EGFR and p53. The cells were positive for Ki67 and N-CoR, the nuclear corepressor of astroglial differentiation. These results suggest that radiation-induced nuclear damage to neural stem cells or early astrocytic precursor cells can prevent normal differentiation and lead to tumor development.

In this study, the authors examined the size and significance of the observed association between occurrences of secondary cancers 5 years after radiotherapy in a large population of men with incident prostate cancer.METHODS: Men with incident prostate cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry and were distinguished by the type of treatment received, tumor stage, tumor grade, and age at diagnosis. SEER data also were used to identify occurrences of secondary cancer beginning 5 years after the date patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted odds of the subsequent occurrence of other cancers associated with types of radiation therapy received and was adjusted for the type of surgery, tumor grade, stage, and patient age.RESULTS: Compared with men who received no prostate cancer-directed radiation, men who received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) as their only form of radiation therapy had statistically significant increased odds of developing secondary cancers at several sites potentially related to radiation therapy, including the bladder (odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.44-1.84) and rectum (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.29-1.99). Men who received EBRT also had statistically significant higher odds of developing secondary cancers at sites in the upper body and other areas not potentially related to radiation therapy, including the cecum (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.10-1.70), transverse colon (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.30-2.63), brain (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.22-2.75), stomach (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.75), melanoma (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.09-1.53), and lung and bronchus (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13-1.37) compared with the odds among men who received no radiation therapy. Men who received radiation therapy in the form of radioactive implants or isotopes, either in isolation or combined with beam radiation, did not have significantly different odds of secondary cancer occurring at any of the 20 most common sites.CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received with EBRT had significantly higher odds of developing second cancers both overall and in the areas that were exposed to radiation. It is noteworthy that, to the authors' knowledge, this report shows for the first time that, despite the higher doses of radiation delivered, patients who received radioactive implants had the lowest odds of developing second cancers.",Included
3498,"Inhibition of Polo-like kinase 1 prevents the growth of metastatic breast cancer cells in the brain Few therapeutic strategies exist for the treatment of metastatic tumor cells in the brain because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits drug access. Thus the identification of molecular targets and accompanying BBB permeable drugs will significantly benefit brain metastasis patients. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an attractive molecular target because it is only expressed in dividing cells and its expression is upregulated in many tumors. Analysis of a publicly available database of human breast cancer metastases revealed Plk1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in brain metastases compared to systemic metastases (P = 0.0018). The selective Plk1 inhibitor, GSK461364A, showed substantial uptake in normal rodent brain. Using a breast cancer brain metastatic xenograft model (231-BR), we tested the efficacy of GSK461364A to prevent brain metastatic colonization. When treatment was started 3 days post-injection, GSK461364A at 50 mg/kg inhibited the development of large brain metastases 62% (P = 0.0001) and prolonged survival by 17%. GSK461364A sensitized tumor cells to radiation induced cell death in vitro. Previously, it was reported that mutations in p53 might render tumor cells more sensitive to Plk1 inhibition; however, p53 mutations are uncommon in breast cancer. In a cohort of 41 primary breast tumors and matched brain metastases, p53 immunostaining was increased in 61% of metastases; 44% of which were associated with primary tumors with low p53. The data suggest that p53 overexpression occurs frequently in brain metastases and may facilitate sensitivity to Plk1 inhibition. These data indicate Plk1 may be a new druggable target for the prevention of breast cancer brain metastases.",Excluded

The exposure to microwaves of high intensity stimulated basal LPO but suppressed activity of LPO-inducing systems. This suggests disturbances in the activity of different sources of active oxygen forms. Microwaves of low intensity activated systems of induced LPO. This is accompanied with synchronous activity of the antioxidant defense system maintaining a normal oxidation-reduction balance of the cell. The conclusion is that, depending on their intensity, microwaves can be either beneficial to health or be a factor of oxidative stress.",Excluded
2730,"Cranial nerve preservation and outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery for jugular foramen schwannomas OBJECTIVE: Jugular foramen region schwannomas are rare intracranial tumors that usually present with multiple lower cranial nerve deficits. For some patients, complete surgical resection is possible but may be associated with significant morbidity. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a minimally invasive alternative or adjunct to microsurgery for such tumors. We reviewed our clinical and imaging outcomes after patients underwent gamma knife radiosurgery for management of jugular foramen schwannomas.METHODS: Thirty-four patients with 35 tumors (one patient had bilateral tumors) underwent radiosurgery between May 1990 and December 2005. Twenty-two patients had previous microsurgical resection and all patients experienced various cranial neuropathies. A median of six isocenters were used. Median marginal and maximum doses were 14 and 28 Gy, respectively.RESULTS: None of the patients were lost to evaluation and the mean duration of follow-up was 83 months. Tumors regressed in 17 patients, remained stable in 16, and progressed in two. Five- and 10-year actuarial control rates were 97 and 94%, respectively. Preexisting cranial neuropathies improved in 20% and remained stable in 77% after radiosurgery. One patient worsened. The function of all previous intact nerves was preserved after radiosurgery.CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiosurgery proved to be a safe and effective management for newly diagnosed or residual jugular foramen schwannomas. Long-term tumor control rates and stability or improvement in cranial nerve function was confirmed.",Excluded

2877,"Spine stereotactic radiosurgery with concurrent tyrosine kinase inhibitors for metastatic renal cell carcinoma OBJECT Systemic control of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has substantially improved with the development of VEGF, mTOR, and checkpoint inhibitors. The current first-line standard of care is a VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). In preclinical models, TKIs potentiate the response to radiotherapy. Such improved efficacy may prolong the time to salvage therapies, including whole-brain radiotherapy or second-line systemic therapy. As the prevalence of mRCC has increased, the utilization of spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has also increased. However, clinical outcomes following concurrent treatment with SRS and TKIs remain largely undefined. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the safety and efficacy of TKIs when delivered concurrently with SRS. The authors hypothesized that first-line TKIs delivered concurrently with SRS significantly increase local control compared with SRS alone or TKIs alone, without increased toxicity. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing spine SRS for mRCC was conducted. Patients undergoing SRS were divided into 4 cohorts: those receiving concurrent first-line TKI therapy (A), systemic therapy-naive patients (B), and patients who were undergoing SRS with (C) or without (D) concurrent TKI treatment after failure of first-line therapy. A negative control cohort (E) was also included, consisting of patients with spinal metastases managed with TKIs alone. The primary outcome was 12-month local failure, defined as any in-field radiographic progression. Multivariate competing risks regression was used to determine the independent effect of concurrent first-line TKI therapy upon local failure. RESULTS One hundred patients who underwent 151 spine SRS treatments (232 vertebral levels) were included. At the time of SRS, 46% were receiving concurrent TKI therapy. In each SRS cohort, the median prescription dose was 16 Gy in 1 fraction. Patients in Cohort A had the highest burden of epidural disease (96%, p < 0.01). At 12 months, the cumulative incidence of local failure was 4% in Cohort A, compared with 19%-27% in Cohorts B-D and 57% in Cohort E (p < 0.01). Multivariate competing risks regression demonstrated that concurrent first-line TKI treatment (Cohort A) was independently associated with a local control benefit (HR 0.21, p = 0.04). In contrast, patients treated with TKIs alone (Cohort E) experienced an increased rate of local failure (HR 2.43, p = 0.03). No toxicities of Grade 3 or greater occurred following SRS with concurrent TKI treatment, and the incidence of post-SRS vertebral fracture (overall 21%) and pain flare (overall 17%) were similar across cohorts. CONCLUSIONS The prognosis for patients with mRCC has significantly improved with TKIs. The present investigation suggests a local control benefit with the addition of concurrent first-line TKI therapy to spine SRS. These results have implications in the oligometastatic setting and support a body of preclinical radiobiological research.",Included

2578,"Effects of hypokinesia and hypodynamia upon protein turnover in hindlimb muscles of the rat Hypokinesia/hypodynamia was induced in the hindlimb muscles of the rat using a suspension technique. This caused differing degrees of atrophy in different muscles, however, this atrophy was reduced in muscles held in a lengthened position. The greatest degree of wasting was observed in the unstretched soleus, a slow postural muscle, where both Type 1 and Type 2a fibers atrophied to the same degree. However, wasting of the gastrocnemius muscle was associated with a reduction in the size of the Type 2b fibers. In both slow postural and fast phasic hindlimb muscles, atrophy was brought about by a reduction in the rate of protein synthesis in conjunction with an elevation in the rate of protein degradation. When inactive muscles were passively stretched, both protein synthesis and degradation were dramatically elevated. Even periods of stretch of as little as 0.5 h.d-1 were found to significantly decrease atrophy in inactive muscles.",Excluded
3583,"The role of PET in target localization for radiotherapy treatment planning Positron emission tomography (PET) is currently accepted as an important tool in oncology, mostly for diagnosis, staging and restaging purposes. It provides a new type of information in radiotherapy, functional rather than anatomical. PET imaging can also be used for target volume definition in radiotherapy treatment planning. The need for very precise target volume delineation has arisen with the increasing use of sophisticated three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy techniques and intensity modulated radiation therapy. It is expected that better delineation of the target volume may lead to a significant reduction in the irradiated volume, thus lowering the risk of treatment complications (smaller safety margins). Better tumour visualisation also allows a higher dose of radiation to be applied to the tumour, which may lead to better tumour control. The aim of this article is to review the possible use of PET imaging in the radiotherapy of various cancers. We focus mainly on non-small cell lung cancer, lymphoma and oesophageal cancer, but also include current opinion on the use of PET-based planning in other tumours including brain, uterine cervix, rectum and prostate.

3340,"Emerging locoregional therapy Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT): SIRT, or radioembolization, delivers yttrium-90 (Y-90) microspheres via a catheter in the hepatic artery to treat intra-hepatic disease. SIRT takes advantage of the fact that the blood supply for much of the normal liver parenchyma arrives through the portal circulation, while tumors are preferentially fed by the arterial system. Glass- or resin-based microspheres tagged with Y-90 are delivered typically in a ""lobar"" fashion and preferentially distribute into the tumoral and peritumoral vasculature, thereby delivering a high radiation dose (>100 Gy). Because Y-90 is a beta emitter, the effect is relatively selective and mostly affects only the metastatic sites while sparing normal liver parenchyma. The two currently available Y-90 products include SIR-spheres and TheraSphere. SIR-spheres deliver a higher dose per treatment and are more embolic. In contrast, the TheraSphere product delivers a higher specific radioactivity dose per microsphere allowing for smaller dose per treatment and are not as embolic. Both products have been shown to be welltolerated. SIRT can be an effective therapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as metastatic colorectal or neuroendocrine liver disease.",Excluded
2643,"Long-term kindling of the basolateral amygdala impairs copulatory behavior in male rats This experiment examined the consequences of long-term kindling of the basolateral amygdala on male sexual behavior and the frequency of both spontaneous wet dog shakes (WDS) and those induced by the 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI. Results demonstrated that following 60 stimulations of the left basolateral amygdala over a 4-week period, male Long-Evans rats exhibited decrements in every aspect of sexual behavior. Specifically, latencies to mount, intromit and ejaculate were all prolonged following long-term kindling, and ejaculation frequencies were significantly reduced. Furthermore, spontaneous peri-copulatory WDS were increased in kindled rats, suggesting a possible role of the 5-HT2A receptor. However, countering this suggestion, there were no differences between sham and kindled rats on WDS induced by the 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI. These results suggest that kindled rats may exhibit elevated levels of endogenous serotonin during exposure to a female rat, which would attenuate copulatory behavior, while concurrently increasing WDS expression.",Excluded

2816,"Results of contemporary surgical management of radiation necrosis using frameless stereotaxis and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging OBJECTIVE: Radiation necrosis is a well-known complication of radiotherapy for malignant brain tumors. Although surgery was once considered the mainstay of treatment, no recent reports have evaluated the use of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (IOMRI) and frameless stereotaxis during surgical resection of radiation necrosis. In this retrospective review, we evaluate the effectiveness of surgical resection using frameless stereotaxis and IOMRI for the treatment of radiation necrosis.METHODS: From October 1999 through February 2002, 11 patients who had malignant brain tumors underwent surgery for radiation necrosis. The diagnosis of radiation necrosis was based primarily on MRI and clinical suspicion. Frameless stereotaxis was used in all patients and IOMRI was used in nine. All patients underwent at least one radiation treatment before surgery and nine patients had multiple treatments. Patient outcome was based on changes in steroid dose, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), and neurologic deficit.RESULTS: Optimal resection as confirmed by IOMRI was achieved in all patients by the use of frameless stereotaxis alone; no additional resection was performed in any patient. For nine patients taking steroids (mean preoperative dose 24 mg/day) before treatment of necrosis, all had a substantial reduction in steroid dosage (mean postoperative dose 8 mg/day) after surgical treatment. Postoperatively, KPS improved in four patients, remained stable in four, and worsened in three. Three complications that resulted from surgery included wound infection, asymptomatic carotid dissection, and pulmonary embolism; thus, overall morbidity including both surgical complications and neurologic deterioration was 54%.CONCLUSIONS: In this review, frameless stereotaxis was helpful in guiding the surgeon; however, IOMRI did not provide any additional benefit for the surgical treatment of radiation necrosis. Surgical treatment of radiation necrosis was associated with high risks of complication or neurologic deficit. Given the success of medical therapies, including hyperbaric oxygen, we believe that surgical treatment of radiation necrosis should be reserved for symptomatic patients in whom medical therapy has failed.",Excluded
3436,"Incidence and management of late adverse radiation effects after arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery Background: Late adverse radiation effects (ARE) typically occur many years after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM). They are characterized by perilesional edema or cyst formation and are distinct from radiationinduced changes (RIC) noted in the first 1 to 2 years after AVM SRS and radiation necrosis. Objective(s): To determine the incidence of late ARE after AVM SRS. Method(s): Retrospective review of 233 AVM patients having SRS from 1990 to 2009. Patients had sporadic AVM, no prior radiation, and a minimum of 5 years of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up. The median MRI follow-up after SRS was 9.8 years (range, 5-24.2). Result(s): Late ARE were observed in 16 patients (6.9%) at a median of 8.7 years after SRS (range, 2.0-16.1). The 5-, 10-, and 15-year incidence of late ARE was 0.4%, 7.7%, and 12.5%, respectively. Eight patients (3.4%) were symptomatic at the time of ARE detection. Three of 8 patients who were initially asymptomatic had documented cyst progression (at 11, 40, and 42 months), for an overall symptomatic rate of 4.7%. Five patients with asymptomatic ARE have been observed for a median of 9.3 years (range, 2.0-14.1) without progression. Patients having early RIC (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.11, P < .001), patients having obliteration (HR=1.24, P=.02), and patients having SRS before April 1997 (HR=1.12, P=.02) weremore likely to develop late ARE. Conclusion(s): Late ARE are common in AVM patients who develop early RIC after SRS. Resection of the thrombosed AVM and the adjacent damaged tissue is effective at eliminating the mass effect and improving patients' neurological condition.

2573,"Neck stiffness in a post-irradiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma adult: An unusual diagnosis Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a neoplasm commonly found in population of South East Asia. The mainstay of treatment is high dose irradiation. Complications from radiotherapy are not uncommon especially to those nearby structures such as vertebrae and spinal cord. A 57 year-old gentleman with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who was treated with chemo-radiation (total of 35 fractions,70Gy) presented to us 6 months post therapy with bilateral nasal discharge and progressive neck stiffness. Nasoendoscopy showed inflamed nasophayngeal mucosa and Computed Tomography (CT) brain and cervical spine showed retropharyngeal and anterior epidural collection with extension into atlantoaxial bone and spinal cord compression. Histopathological specimen revealed features of chronic inflammations with multiple actinomycetes colonies. Our patient suffered severe neck stiffness and loss of sensations on both upper limbs. He was treated conservatively with Halo vest and intravenous antibiotics for 8 weeks and recovered fully. Irradiation in NPC is known to cause devastating complications to cervical spine such as osteoradionecrosis, osteomyelitis. It also renders tissues hypoxic and risk of getting rare infection like actinomycosis.

3459,"[Radiation-induced neuropathies: collateral damage of improved cancer prognosis] INTRODUCTION: Because of the improvement of cancer prognosis, long-term damages of treatments become a medical and public health problem. Among the iatrogenic complications, neurological impairment is crucial to consider since motor disability and pain have a considerable impact on quality of life of long cancer survivors. However, radiation-induced neuropathies have not been the focus of great attention. The objective of this paper is to provide an updated review about the radiation-induced lesions of the peripheral nerve system.STATE OF THE ART: Radiation-induced neuropathies are characterized by their heterogeneity in both symptoms and disease course. Signs and symptoms depend on the affected structures of the peripheral nerve system (nerve roots, nerve plexus or nerve trunks). Early-onset complications are often transient and late complications are usually progressive and associated with a poor prognosis. The most frequent and well known is delayed radiation-induced brachial plexopathy, which may follow breast cancer irradiation. Radiation-induced lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy is characterized by pure or predominant lower motor neuron signs. They can be misdiagnosed, confused with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or with leptomeningeal metastases since nodular MRI enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina and increased cerebrospinal fluid protein content can be observed. In the absence of specific markers of the link with radiotherapy, the diagnosis of post-radiation neuropathy may be difficult. Recently, a posteriori conformal radiotherapy with 3D dosimetric reconstitution has been developed to link a precise anatomical site to unexpected excess irradiation.PERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSION: The importance of early diagnosis of radiation-induced neuropathies is underscored by the emergence of new disease-modifying treatments. Although the pathophysiology is not fully understood, it is already possible to target radiation-induced fibrosis but also associated factors such as ischemia, oxidative stress and inflammation. A phase III trial evaluating the association of pentoxifylline, tocopherol and clodronate (PENTOCLO, NCT01291433) in radiation-induced neuropathies is now recruiting.",Excluded

3278,"Stereotactic Gamma thalamotomy for the treatment of parkinsonism From September 1994 to June 1995, eight patients with intractable parkinsonism underwent gamma thalamotomy in our hospital. All of these patients were male, with an average age of 59.3 years. The duration of the disease from initial diagnosis was 2-10 years (mean 6.8 years). All had failed or had serious side effects with antiparkinsonian medicine. Seven cases had tremor-dominant symptoms, while the other had mainly rigidity. Six cases had bilateral symptoms. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was undertaken prior to treatment in all cases to exclude focal brain lesions. Stereotactic MRI was taken with the Leksell frame in place and both T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained. The targets were located in the area of Vim/Voa/Vop based on the Schaltenbrand atlas. In seven cases, two plugged 4-mm-collimator shots were used. The maximum dose was 160 Gy in six cases and 180 Gy in one case. In another case, a single 4-mm-collimator shot was used, and a maximum dose of 160 Gy was delivered to the target center. The border of the internal capsule was outside the 20-30% isodose line. We intended the 50% isodose line to have an oval-shaped region with the use of two shots and should correspond to the shape of Vim. Follow-up data were available for six patients (mean: 4.5 months, range: 2-9 months). Tremor disappeared in three cases and improved in the other three. In one of these six cases, the tremor disappeared just 3 days after gamma thalamotomy. Rigidity improved in four of these six cases.

Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy using the somatostatin analogue [177Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>, Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotate is a convincing treatment modality for metastasized neuroendocrine tumors. Therapeutic doses are administered in 4 cycles with 6-10 week intervals. A high somatostatin receptor density on tumor cells is a prerequisite at every administration to enable effective therapy. In this study, the density of the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2) was investigated in the rat CA20948 pancreatic tumor model after low dose [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>, Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotate administration resulting in approximately 20 Gy tumor radiation absorbed dose, whereas 60 Gy is needed to induce complete tumor regression in these and the majority of tumors. Methods. Sixteen days after inoculation of the CA20948 tumor, male Lewis rats were injected with 185 MBq [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>, Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotate to initiate a decline in tumor size. Approximately 40 days after injection, tumors re-grew progressively after initial response.

2608,"Preservation of cognitive function following whole brain radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases: Complications, treatments, and the emerging role of memantine Whole brain radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients suffering from stage IV malignancies that have metastasized to the brain. Although this therapy is often effective at reducing tumor size and burden, it is associated with a spectrum of toxicities that often result in irreversible cognitive decline. Various drug and non-drug therapies have been evaluated to treat this neurotoxicity after whole brain radiotherapy is administered; however, currently available options have shown little benefit or come with side effects themselves that may outweigh the benefits of their use. For this reason, current investigations are focusing on preventing cognitive decline, rather than attempting to attenuate symptoms after they occur. Memantine has consistently shown promise in both in-vitro and in-vivo studies as a neuroprotective agent that may improve cognitive outcomes in patients undergoing whole brain radiotherapy. Memantine use prior to and during whole brain radiotherapy has been shown to significantly delay time to cognitive failure and reduce the rate of decline in memory, cognitive function, and processing speed. Its use has also been linked to significant decreases in brain edema, brain infarct size, and brain vasculature changes following whole brain radiotherapy. Memantine offers a promising safety profile with high tolerability and limited side effects. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of the target patient population, the neurotoxic effects of WBRT, current treatment options, and a summary of the available literature surrounding the use of memantine in this setting.",Excluded
3325,"""Low-intensity laser therapy effect on the recovery of traumatic spinal cord injury"" Scientific advances have been made to optimize the healing process in spinal cord injury. Studies have been developed to obtain effective treatments in controlling the secondary injury that occurs after spinal cord injury, which substantially changes the prognosis. Low-intensity laser therapy (LILT) has been applied in neuroscience due to its anti-inflammatory effects on biological tissue in the repairing process. Few studies have been made associating LILT to the spinal cord injury. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the LILT (GaAlAs laser-780 nm) on the locomotor functional recovery, histomorphometric, and histopathological changes of the spinal cord after moderate traumatic injury in rats (spinal cord injury at T9 and T10). Thirty-one adult Wistar rats were used, which were divided into seven groups: control without surgery (n = 3), control surgery (n = 3), laser 6 h after surgery (n = 5), laser 48 h after surgery (n = 5), medullar lesion (n = 5) without phototherapy, medullar lesion + laser 6 h after surgery (n = 5), and medullar lesion + laser 48 h after surgery (n = 5). The assessment of the motor function was performed using Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale and adapted Sciatic Functional Index (aSFI). The assessment of urinary dysfunction was clinically performed. After 21 days postoperative, the animals were euthanized for histological and histomorphometric analysis of the spinal cord. The results showed faster motor evolution in rats with spinal contusion treated with LILT, maintenance of the effectiveness of the urinary system, and preservation of nerve tissue in the lesion area, with a notorious inflammation control and increased number of nerve cells and connections.

Mean tumor volume was 4.2 cm<sup>3</sup> and mean margin dose was 16.2 Gy. 6-month, 1-year, and 18-month survival rates were 73.6, 58, and 46%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher KPS scores, no evidence of extracranial metastasis, and controlled primary disease were significantly related to longer survival. Adjuvant whole brain irradiation did not significantly influence on the prolongation of survival time and local control of radiosurgically treated lesions. Copyright © 2002 S.

3509,"MRI changes in the rat hippocampus following proton radiosurgery PURPOSE: To define radiographic dose-response relationships for proton radiosurgery using a rat brain model.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A group of 23 rats was treated with Bragg peak proton beam irradiation involving the right hippocampus. Single doses of 5, 12, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 130 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) were delivered to groups of 3 animals using single fraction technique. One extra animal was included at the 130- and 30-CGE doses. Animals were imaged using a standard 1.5-tesla GE Signa MRI. A 3-inch surface coil was employed to obtain T1-weighted sagittal images (TR 600 and TE 30) and dual echo T2-weighted coronal images (TR 3,000 and TE 30/90). Animals were imaged at 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6 and 9 months. Volumetric analysis with custom software was done to evaluate areas of increased signal on T2-weighted images, and signal change versus time curves were generated. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging was also done at the 9-month time point to further evaluate tissue injury. The development of hydrocephalus was also examined.RESULTS: Peak tissue injury was greater and occurred earlier with higher versus lower doses of radiation. Statistically significant differences were seen between the 130- and 90-CGE animals and between the 90- and 60-CGE animals (p < 0.0016) using ANOVA. Signal changes can be seen in at least 1 of the animals at 20 CGE. The largest volume of tissue enhancement at 9 months was seen in animals at 60 CGE, which may represent an intermediate zone of tissue injury and gliosis compared with greater tissue loss at higher doses and less injury at lower doses. Hydrocephalus developed first in the untreated hemisphere in 130- and 90-CGE animals as a result of mass effect while it occurred at a later time in the treated hemisphere in lower-dose animals.CONCLUSIONS: Following single-dose proton radiosurgery of rat hippocampus, serial MRIs show T2 signal changes in animals ranging from 130 down to 20 CGE as well as the development of hydrocephalus. Dose-effect relationships using proton radiosurgery in rats will be a helpful step in guiding further studies on radiation injury to brain tissue.",Included
3179,"Determining elemental tissue composition from dual energy cone-beam CT using principal component analysis and a shallow neural network Purpose: Due to the use of kV photon beams in small animal radiotherapy, the dose deposition is strongly dependent on the elemental tissue composition. We present a novel method to extract continuous elemental tissue compositions from dual energy CBCT (DE-CBCT) images. Method(s): We use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the material space. For each DE-CBCT image, we first classify individual voxels as air, soft tissue, or bone through a support vector machine. In a next step, a shallow neural network determines the weights of the principal components. All images were acquired on the Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (XStrahl Ltd). The DE-CBCT imaging protocol was optimised over a range of energy and tin filter combinations. The model is calibrated on a mousesized solid water phantom with 10 tissue-equivalent material inserts with known elemental composition. We validate the model on a second phantom with 6 different tissue-equivalent inserts, and compare the predictions to a conventional PCA method with a linear regression model. We additionally apply the new method to a mouse DE-CBCT. Result(s): The material composition in the 6 inserts of the validation phantom was extracted with a mean squared error of 1%, averaged over all inserts. This is an improvement over conventional PCA methods without a neural network (3% average mean squared error), especially for bony tissues. While no ground truth is available for the mouse tissues, we found good agreement with the composition from the material database, for instance within 3% for the mouse brain. Conclusion(s): We presented a novel method to extract the elemental tissue composition from DE-CBCT images. The continuous assignment of materials is expected to reduce discretisation errors in dose calculations compared to current approaches, where only 4 to 7 materials are used.",Excluded
2523,"X-ray therapy promotes structural regeneration after spinal cord injury in a rat model OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of x-ray treatment on rats following spinal cord injury (SCI).METHODS: Forty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to spinal cord injury using the modified Allen weight-drop method. The animals were randomly divided into six groups. Two of the animal groups were irradiated with 10 Gy at the lesion site; another two groups were irradiated with 20 Gy; and the last two groups without irradiation were regarded as the sham group. One of the each of two animal groups was euthanized at different time points at 4 and 12 weeks, respectively, after irradiation. Spinal cord calluses were assessed using kinology and electrophysiology and histology methods.RESULTS: In all of the groups, the neurofilament (NF) counts at 14 weeks were found to be higher than that at 6 weeks after SCI. Both 10-Gy irradiated and 20-Gy irradiated groups were higher than those of the sham group at each time point (P < 0.05). The myelin basic protein (MBP) count decreased at 14 weeks after SCI in the irradiated groups (P < 0.05) but increased at 14 weeks in the sham group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the MBP count of the irradiated groups was lower than that of the sham group at 14 weeks (P < 0.05). The glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Nogo-A counts at 14 weeks were higher than those at 6 weeks in all the groups (P < 0.05), and there was no statistical significance with kinology and electrophysiology tests in all groups.CONCLUSIONS: A self-repair mechanism exists after spinal cord injury, which lasts at least 14 weeks. X-ray therapy promotes the regeneration of the spinal cord system after injury.",Excluded
2829,"Non-invasive follow-up of patients with intracranial arteriovenous malformations after proton-beam radiation therapy In order better to follow non-invasively the effect of proton beam therapy upon intracranial arteriovenous malformations, transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) was used in 10 patients, in addition to conventional follow-up with angiography and computed tomography (CT); in six patients, pre- and postradiation TCD studies were obtained. The mean flow values obtained from the major arteries in the circle of Willis indicate an early flow reduction through the AVM of approximately 15% with further reduction between 2/3 and 1/2 of the initial values within 15 months of follow-up. CT showed a reduction of contrast enhancement in those patients in whom scans could be compared. In this limited experience, TCD was proven to yield additional information, in repeated non-invasive studies, on the haemodynamic influence of AVMs and the effect of proton beam therapy.",Excluded

2834,"The early causal influence of cell size upon synaptic number: the mutant gigas of Drosophila The number of synaptic contacts formed by a neuron is known to vary with its surface area. This could be because large neurons are able to establish more synaptic sites, or because those neurons that are able to establish more sites are subsequently able to enlarge. To test between these two possibilities clones of enlarged ommatidia were generated in the retina of the Drosophila mutant gigas, by mitotic recombination following gamma-irradiation in the third-instar larva. The numbers of afferent synaptic contacts formed by the photoreceptor terminals in the first optic neuropil, or lamina, were then counted in the adult. The terminals of mutant photoreceptors were also enlarged, but by varying degrees. The sizes of their profiles in single sections merged with the size distribution of terminals having a wild-type phenotype, lying outside the clone in the same lamina. A perimeter of 6.0 microns for the profiles of receptor terminal in cross section was established as a criterion for distinguishing between normal and mutant phenotypes. The mutant terminals had more presynaptic sites. Because only the gigas terminals are mutant and because they enlarged at a time long before synapse formation occurred in the lamina we may conclude that cell enlargement preceded elevated synaptic number. The increase in synaptic number roughly matched the increased membrane surface of the terminals, so as nearly to preserve a constant areal density of synaptic sites over a 5-fold range in synaptic frequency.",Excluded
2688,"Interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost: The feasibility and cosmetic outcome of a fractionated outpatient delivery scheme Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility, potential toxicity, and cosmetic outcome of fractionated interstitial high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost for the management of patients with breast cancer at increased risk for local recurrence.Methods and Materials: From 1994 to 1996, 18 women with early stage breast cancer underwent conventionally fractionated whole breast radiotherapy (50-50.4 Gy) followed by interstitial HDR brachytherapy boost. All were considered to be at high risk for local failure. Seventeen had pathologically confirmed final surgical margins of less than 2 mm or focally positive. Brachytherapy catheter placement and treatment delivery were conducted on an outpatient basis. Preplanning was used to determine optimal catheter positions to enhance dose homogeneity of dose delivery. The total HDR boost dose was 15 Gy delivered in 6 fractions of 2.5 Gy over 3 days. Local control, survival, late toxicities (LENT-SOMA), and cosmetic outcome were recorded in follow-up. In addition, factors potentially influencing cosmesis were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Result(s): The minimum follow-up is 40 months with a median 50 months. Sixteen patients were alive without disease at last follow-up. There have been no in-breast failures observed. One patient died with brain metastases, and another died of unrelated causes without evidence of disease. Grade 1-2 late toxicities included 39% with hyperpigmentation, 56% with detectable fibrosis, 28% with occasional discomfort, and 11% with visible telangiectasias. Grade 3 toxicity was reported in one patient as persistent discomfort. Sixty-seven percent of patients were considered to have experienced good/excellent cosmetic outcomes. Factors with a direct relationship to adverse cosmetic outcome were extent of surgical defect (p = 0.00001), primary excision volume (p = 0.017), and total excision volume (p = 0.015). Conclusion(s): For high risk patients who may benefit from increased doses, interstitial HDR brachytherapy provides a convenient outpatient method for boosting the lumpectomy cavity following conventional whole breast irradiation without overdosing normal tissues. The fractionation scheme of 15 Gy in 6 fractions over 3 days is well tolerated. The volume of tissue removed from the breast at lumpectomy appears to dominate cosmetic outcome in this group of patients. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded
3541,"Feasibility, Safety, and Periprocedural Complications of Pipeline Embolization for Intracranial Aneurysm Treatment Under Conscious Sedation: University at Buffalo Neurosurgery Experience BACKGROUND: Endovascular Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) placement for intracranial aneurysms is performed under general anesthesia at most centers because of perceived improved image quality and patient safety.OBJECTIVE: To report the feasibility, safety, and outcomes associated with the use of the PED for intracranial aneurysms performed in awake patients after the administration of conscious sedation (CS) and a local anesthetic.METHODS: Between March 2012 and September 2014, 130 patients with 139 intracranial aneurysms (8 ruptured) were treated with the PED under CS at our institution. Procedure details and time (including duration, radiation exposure, and fluoroscopy) and procedure-related complications were retrospectively reviewed.RESULTS: A total of 155 PED deployment procedures were performed under CS. Treatment was successfully completed in all cases. Anesthesia was converted from CS to general anesthesia during 5 procedures. Mean interval from patient entry at the endovascular suite to procedure initiation was 18 minutes (range, 5 minutes-1 hour 10 minutes). Mean procedure length was 1 hour 25 minutes (range, 30 minutes-3 hours 51 minutes). Mean +/- SD values for fluoroscopy time and radiation exposure were 36.17 +/- 18.4 minutes and 1367 +/- 897 mGy, respectively. The mean amount of contrast material administered was 211.37 +/- 83.5 mL. Permanent neurological complications were seen in 4 patients (3%).CONCLUSION: In our experience, CS for PED placement for intracranial aneurysm treatment is feasible and safe. Procedure and fluoroscopy times and amount of radiation exposure are similar to or less than described in reports of PED placement under general anesthesia. CS allows direct neurological evaluation and earlier detection of and response to intraprocedural complications.",Excluded
3105,"Effect of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide-38 on sensory neuropeptide release and neurogenic inflammation in rats and mice Substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), released from capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves induce local neurogenic inflammation, while somatostatin exerts systemic anti-inflammatory actions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the release of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38) and its effects on sensory neuropeptide release in vitro and acute neurogenic ear swelling in vivo. Capsaicin (10(-6) M) or electrical field stimulation (EFS; 40 V, 0.1 ms, 10 Hz, 120 s; 1200 impulses)-induced release of PACAP-38, SP, CGRP and somatostatin from isolated rat tracheae was measured with radioimmunoassay. Mustard oil-induced neurogenic inflammation in the mouse ear was determined with a micrometer and in the rat hind paw skin by the Evans Blue leakage technique. Capsaicin and EFS evoked 27% and more than twofold elevation of PACAP-38 release respectively, compared with the prestimulated basal values from isolated trachea preparation. Exogenously administered PACAP-38 (20-2000 nM) diminished both capsaicin- and EFS-evoked sensory neuropeptide release in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximal inhibitory effects of PACAP on capsaicin-induced substance P, CGRP and somatostatin release amounted to 75.4%, 73.3% and 90.0%, while EFS-evoked release of these peptides was 80.03%, 87.7% and 67.7%. In case of capsaicin stimulation the EC50 values for substance P, CGRP and somatostatin were 82.9 nM, 60.1 nM and 66.9 nM, respectively. When EFS was performed, these corresponding EC50 data were 92.1 nM, 67.8 nM and 20.9 nM. PACAP-38 (10, 100 and 1000 microg/kg i.p. in 200 microl volume) inhibited neurogenic ear swelling in the mouse. Furthermore, 100 microg/kg i.p. PACAP also significantly diminished mustard oil-evoked plasma protein extravasation in the rat skin. These results suggest that PACAP-38 is released from the stimulated peripheral terminals of capsaicin-sensitive afferents and it is able to inhibit the outflow of sensory neuropeptides. Based on this mechanism of action PACAP is also able to effectively diminish/abolish neurogenic inflammatory response in vivo after systemic administration.",Excluded
3329,"Retinal damage experimentally induced by microwave radiation at 55 mW/cm2 The action of 550 W/m2 (mean) 3100 MHz pulsed radiation on the rabbit retina in vivo was investigated by fundus photography, blood-retinal barrier tracers, light and electron microscopy, either after a single 1--1.5 h exposure or after a series of repeated 1 h exposures for up to 53 h during about 100 days. The electron microscopic investigation of the repeatedly exposed retinas revealed degenerative changes in the retinal neurons. The neurons appeared depleted of their cytoplasmic constituents and often contained phago-lysosomal structures with myelin bodies. There were many degenerating synaptic boutons. The glial cells displayed reactive changes. These ultrastructural changes could not be demonstrated by the other methods used. A single microwave exposure, followed by an induced 70--100% blood-pressure increase, did not enhance blood-retina barrier permeability to tracers. There was no evidence of blood brain barrier leakage. These studies show that the rabbit eye can be affected by microwave radiation at intensities lower than previously reported.",Excluded
2498,"Abciximab (ReoPro) Dosing Strategy for the Management of Acute Intraprocedural Thromboembolic Complications during Pipeline Flow Diversion Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms Background: Flow diversion with the Pipeline embolization device (PED) is an effective neuro-endovascular method and increasingly accepted for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. Acute in situ thrombosis is a known complication of PED procedures. There is limited experience in the flow diversion literature on the use of abciximab (ReoPro) for the management of acute thrombus formation in PED cases. Method(s): Data were collected retrospectively on patients who received intra-arterial (IA) ReoPro with or without subsequent intravenous (IV) infusion during PED flow diversion treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Result(s): A total of 30 cases in patients with a mean age of 56.7 years (range 36-84) and a mean aneurysm size of 8.6 mm (range 2-25) were identified to have intraprocedural thromboembolic complications during PED treatment. IA ReoPro was administered in all cases, with 20 cases receiving increments of 5-mg boluses and 10 cases receiving a 0.125 mg/kg IA bolus (half cardiac dosing). Complete or partial recanalization was achieved in 100% of the cases. IV ReoPro infusion at 0.125 mug/kg/min for 12 h was administered postprocedurally in 22 cases with a residual thrombus. Postprocedurally, 18 patients were transitioned from clopidogrel (Plavix) to prasugrel (Effient). The majority of the cases (23/30; 77%) were discharged home. Periprocedural intracranial hemorrhage was noted in 2 cases (7%) and radiographic infarct was noted in 4 cases (13%), with an overall mortality of 0% at the time of initial discharge. Clinical follow-up was available for 28/30 patients. The average duration of follow-up was 11.7 months, at which time 23/28 (82%) of the patients had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0. Conclusion(s): IA ReoPro administration is an effective and safe rescue strategy for the management of acute intraprocedural thromboembolic complications during PED treatment. Using a dosing strategy of either 5-mg increments or a 0.125 mg/kg IA bolus (half cardiac dosing) can provide high rates of recanalization with low rates of hemorrhagic complications and long-term morbidity.

3076,Post-mortem observation of glioma and/or brain tissue compared to C-T scan findings after irradiation. [Japanese] C-T scan findings in glioma and brain tissue after irradiation were histopathologically analyzed with the post-mortem examination of 4 patients. High density of contrast enhancement observed in gliomas mainly corresponded to proliferation of irregular blood vessels and hypodensity reflected less cellular area or necrotic foci in the tumor tissue. A mottled lesion with high density margin in C-T of radionecrosis of the brain tissue observed in a non-glioma patient was formed by coagulation necrosis showing marked proliferation of telangiectatic blood vessels in periphery of lesion and acellular area in the center. It is occasionally impossible to differentiate the findings between delayed radionecrosis of brain and recurrence of glioma using the C-T criteria alone.,Excluded
