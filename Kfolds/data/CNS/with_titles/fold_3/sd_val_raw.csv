4080,"Crossed cerebellar diaschisis after stroke identified noninvasively with cerebral blood flow-weighted arterial spin labeling MRI BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) is most commonly investigated using hemodynamic PET and SPECT imaging. However, noninvasive MRI offers advantages of improved spatial resolution, allowing hemodynamic changes to be compared directly with structural findings and without concerns related to ionizing radiation exposure. The aim of this study was to evaluate relationships between CCD identified from cerebral blood flow (CBF)-weighted arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI with cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR)-weighted blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) MRI, Wallerian degeneration, clinical motor impairment, and corticospinal tract involvement.METHODS: Subjects (n=74) enrolled in an ongoing observational stroke trial underwent CBF-weighted ASL and hypercapnic CVR-weighted BOLD MRI. Hemispheric asymmetry indices for basal cerebellar CBF, cerebellar CVR, and cerebral peduncular area were compared between subjects with unilateral supratentorial infarcts (n=18) and control subjects without infarcts (n=16). CCD required (1) supratentorial infarct and (2) asymmetric cerebellar CBF (>95% confidence interval relative to controls).RESULTS: In CCD subjects (n=9), CVR (p=0.04) and cerebral peduncular area (p<0.01) were significantly asymmetric compared to controls. Compared to infarct subjects not meeting CCD criteria (n=9), CCD subjects had no difference in corticospinal tract location for infarct (p=1.0) or motor impairment (p=0.08).CONCLUSIONS: CCD correlated with cerebellar CVR asymmetry and Wallerian degeneration. These findings suggest that noninvasive MRI may be a useful alternative to PET or SPECT to study structural correlates and clinical consequences of CCD following supratentorial stroke.",Excluded
4805,"Radiotherapy in Combination with Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapy Is a Safe and Promising Approach in Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma Patients with High Tumor Burden Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy (RT) for localized-refractory or relapsed (R/R) DLBCL after chemotherapy is a standard therapy. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) therapy is demonstrated as a novel immunotherapy modality with impressive efficacy in R/R B-cell malignancies including DLBCL. However, CAR-T therapy is also associated with potentially fatal toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurological toxicities. Whether radiotherapy in combination with CAR-T is a better approach to enhancing efficacy and decreasing toxicity of CAR-T therapy in R/R DLBCL patients with high tumor burden remains unknown. Materials/Methods: Human CD3+T cells were separated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMS) of patients or donors by degradable anti-CD3 magnetic microbeads followed by 24h stimulation with CD3 and CD28 monoclonal antibody (5ug/ml). Then CD3+T cells were transduced with humanized CAR construct targeting CD19, CD20 and CD22 and further expanded for 7 to 10 days in vitro. 14 patients with high tumor burden R/R DLBCL were enrolled in the study. Patients from 39 to 66 years of age had received two to four prior lines of therapy. 7 patients received intensive second-line chemotherapy (median age, 46 years) and 7 received radiotherapy (median age, 63 years) to debulking tumor after leukapheresis and during CAR-T cells preparation. Intensive combined chemotherapy or radiation (40 Gy in 20 fractions) were carried out for debulking condition after sequential FC regimen (cyclophosphamide 300mg/m<sup>2</sup> and fludarabine 30mg/m<sup>2</sup> X 3d) for lymphodepletion chemotherapy. Two days after FC regimen, CAR-T cells targeting CD19 and CD20 or CD22 at average dose of 1-2x10<sup>7</sup> cells for each target per kilogram (kg) were infused within 3 days. Result(s): Severe CRS (grade 3/4/5) was reported in all patients of chemotherapy cohort and mild CRS (grade 1/2) was reported in all patients of radiation cohort. 4 patients (57.1%) in chemotherapy cohort showed neurological toxicity while no patient in radiation cohort showed neurological toxicity. Comparable hematological/non-hematological toxicity and non-neurological toxicity were observed in both two groups. In chemotherapy cohort, four of seven (57.1%) patients achieved an objective response after CAR-T infusion with three of seven (42.9%) achieving a CR. In radiation cohort, seven of seven (100%) achieved an objective response after CAR-T therapy with four of seven (57.1%) achieving a CR. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that compared to intensive second-line chemotherapy, radiation is a better approach with enhanced efficacy and decreased toxicity of CAR-T therapy in R/R DLBCL patients with high tumor burden. Radiotherapy in combination with CAR-T cell infusion may be the optimal alternative treatment model of R/R DLBCL with high tumor burden. Copyright Â© 2019",Excluded

4738,"Bone Pain in Cancer Patients: Mechanisms and Current Treatment The skeletal system is the third most common site for cancer metastases, surpassed only by the lungs and liver. Many tumors, especially those of the breast, prostate, lungs, and kidneys, have a strong predilection to metastasize to bone, which causes pain, hypercalcemia, pathological skeletal fractures, compression of the spinal cord or other nervous structures, decreased mobility, and increased mortality. Metastatic cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is a type of chronic pain with unique and complex pathophysiology characterized by nociceptive and neuropathic components. Its treatment should be multimodal (pharmacological and non-pharmacological), including causal anticancer and symptomatic analgesic treatment to improve quality of life (QoL). The aim of this paper is to discuss the mechanisms involved in the occurrence and persistence of cancer-associated bone pain and to review the treatment methods recommended by experts in clinical practice. The final part of the paper reviews experimental therapeutic methods that are currently being studied and that may improve the efficacy of bone pain treatment in cancer patients in the future.",Excluded

4096,"Targeting of externalized alphaB-crystallin on irradiated endothelial cells with pro-thrombotic vascular targeting agents: Potential applications for brain arteriovenous malformations BACKGROUND: Vascular targeting uses molecular markers on the surface of diseased vasculature for ligand-directed drug delivery to induce vessel occlusion or destruction. In the absence of discriminatory markers, such as in brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), stereotactic radiosurgery may be used to prime molecular changes on the endothelial surface. This study explored alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) as a radiation induced target and pre-tested the specificity and efficacy of a CRYAB-targeting coaguligand for in vitro thrombus induction.METHODS: A parallel-plate flow system was established to circulate human whole blood over a layer of human brain endothelial cells. A conjugate of anti-CRYAB antibody and thrombin was injected into the circuit to compare binding and thrombus formation on cells with or without prior radiation treatment (0-25 Gy).RESULTS: Radiation increased CRYAB expression and surface exposure in human brain endothelial cells. In the parallel-plate flow system, the targeted anti-CRYAB-thrombin conjugate increased thrombus formation on the surface of irradiated cells relative to non-irradiated cells and to a non-targeting IgG-thrombin conjugate. Fibrin deposition and accumulation of fibrinogen degradation products increased significantly at radiation doses at or above 15 Gy with conjugate concentrations of 1.25 and 2.5 mug/mL.CONCLUSIONS: CRYAB exposure can be detected at the surface of human brain endothelial cells in response to irradiation. Pro-thrombotic CRYAB-targeting conjugates can bind under high flow conditions and in the presence of whole blood induce stable thrombus formation with high specificity and efficacy on irradiated surfaces. CRYAB provides a novel radiation marker for potential vascular targeting in irradiated brain AVMs.",Included

3731,"The 2100MHz radiofrequency radiation of a 3G-mobile phone and the DNA oxidative damage in brain We aimed to evaluate the effect of 2100MHz radiofrequency radiation emitted by a generator, simulating a 3G-mobile phone on the brain of rats during 10 and 40 days of exposure. The female rats were randomly divided into four groups. Group I; exposed to 3G modulated 2100MHz RFR signal for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 2 weeks, group II; control 10 days, were kept in an inactive exposure set-up for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 2 weeks, group III; exposed to 3G modulated 2100MHz RFR signal for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 8 weeks and group IV; control 40 days, were kept in an inactive exposure set-up for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 8 weeks. After the genomic DNA content of brain was extracted, oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine, pg/mL) and malondialdehyde (MDA, nmoL/g tissue) levels were determined. Our main finding was the increased oxidative DNA damage to brain after 10 days of exposure with the decreased oxidative DNA damage following 40 days of exposure compared to their control groups. Besides decreased lipid peroxidation end product, MDA, was observed after 40 days of exposure. The measured decreased quantities of damage during the 40 days of exposure could be the means of adapted and increased DNA repair mechanisms.",Excluded
3690,"Outpatient follow-up of nonoperative cerebral contusion and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage: does repeat head CT alter clinical decision-making? OBJECTIVES: Many neurosurgeons obtain repeat head CT at the first clinic follow-up visit for nonoperative cerebral contusion and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH). The authors undertook a single-center, retrospective study to determine whether outpatient CT altered clinical decision-making.METHODS: The authors evaluated 173 consecutive adult patients admitted to their institution from April 2006 to August 2012 with an admission diagnosis of cerebral contusion or tSAH and at least 1 clinic follow-up visit with CT. Patients with epidural, subdural, aneurysmal subarachnoid, or intraventricular hemorrhage, and those who underwent craniotomy, were excluded. Patient charts were reviewed for new CT findings, new patient symptoms, and changes in treatment plan. Patients were stratified by neurological symptoms into 3 groups: 1) asymptomatic; 2) mild, nonspecific symptoms; and 3) significant symptoms. Mild, nonspecific symptoms included minor headaches, vertigo, fatigue, and mild difficulties with concentration, short-term memory, or sleep; significant symptoms included moderate to severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, focal neurological complaints, impaired consciousness, or new cognitive impairment evident on routine clinical examination.RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three patients met inclusion criteria, with initial clinic follow-up obtained within approximately 6 weeks. Of the 173 patients, 104 (60.1%) were asymptomatic, 68 patients (39.3%) had mild, nonspecific neurological symptoms, and 1 patient (1.0%) had significant neurological symptoms. Of the asymptomatic patients, 3 patients (2.9%) had new CT findings and 1 of these patients (1.0%) underwent a change in treatment plan because of these findings. This change involved an additional clinic appointment and CT to monitor a 12-mm chronic subdural hematoma that ultimately resolved without treatment. Of the patients with mild, nonspecific neurological symptoms, 6 patients (8.8%) had new CT findings and 3 of these patients (4.4%) underwent a change in treatment plan because of these findings; none of these patients required surgical intervention. The single patient with significant neurological symptoms did not have any new CT findings.CONCLUSIONS: Repeat outpatient CT of asymptomatic patients after nonoperative cerebral contusion and tSAH is very unlikely to demonstrate significant new pathology. Given the cost and radiation exposure associated with CT, imaging should be reserved for patients with significant symptoms or focal findings on neurological examination.",Excluded
4219,"Procoagulant and inflammatory mediators in small cell lung carcinoma: Potential role in thromboembolic complications Background: Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC) patients exhibit a higher prevalence of thromboembolic complications. We hypothesized that in this malignancy, procoagulant and inflammatory mediators contribute to the pathogenesis of such complications and warfarin may down regulate these levels. Method(s): In a prospective, randomized, controlled study, patients with inoperable lung cancer (n=100) were randomized to receive chemotherapy and radiation with and without warfarin (INR 1.5 - 2.5). Blood samples were drawn prior to and after the 2nd treatment cycle with warfarin or control and retrospectively analyzed for microparticles and thrombin generation markers such as fibrinopeptide A (FPA), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and prothrombin fragment F1.2 (F1.2). In addition, biochip array for C-reactive protein (CRP), D Dimer, neuron specific enolase (NSE), neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), and thrombomodulin (TM) were measured. The results were compared with a normal population (N=50). Result(s): The microparticles were markedly increased in the SCLC patients (3 fold increase) at baseline. Similary, the thrombin generation markers showed variable increase (1.5-3.2 fold increase). In the biochip array analysis, variable increase was noted. CRP (2.4 fold), D DIMER (11.6 fold), NSE (1.8 fold), NGAL (1.7 fold), TNFR1 (2 fold) and TM (1.3 fold) were all increased as compared to normal controls. All of the markers exhibited a decrease after warfarin treatment with a most pronounced decrease in the D Dimer and TNFR1. Conclusion(s): These results validate the hypothesis that SCLC patients exhibit a hypercoagulable state that is associated with simultaneous upregulation of inflammatory mediators. Warfarin treatment results in a down regulation of these mediators. Our results provide a rationale for prophylactic anticoagulant therapy in this group of patients.",Excluded
4460,"Monkey, rat, and first in human evaluation of [<sup>18</sup>F]PF- 06445974, a PET radioligand that preferentially labels phosphodiesterase 4B Introduction: Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) metabolizes and terminates the actions of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 has four isozymes: A, B, C, and D. PDE4B and PDE4D have the highest expression in brain and are linked to cognitive deficits as well as major depressive disorder (MDD). This PET study assessed the newly developed PDE4B-selective radioligand [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 in rats, rhesus monkeys and, for the first time, humans. A concomitant goal was to determine whether [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 could accurately quantify PDE4 in human brain. Method(s): In two human subjects, two whole body PET scans for radiation exposure dosimetry and three brain PET scans for specific PDE4B quantification were performed. In the pharmacokinetic analysis, target enzyme density was quantified as total distribution volume (V ) using the two-tissue compartment model and serial concentrations of parent radioligand in arterial plasma. In one male rhesus monkey, four PET whole body scans were performed on different days. The first scan was acquired under baseline conditions, and rolipram (1.0 mg/kg), a PDE4 inhibitor, was administered IV in the second scan. The same baseline and blocked paradigms were repeated with PF- 06445974 (0.1 mg/kg) as the blocking drug. Finally, brain PET scans were conducted in four rats. Concentration of radioactivity as standardized uptake value (SUV) was compared across conditions and species. Result(s): [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 readily entered human brain and showed widespread distribution, with lower binding in cerebellum. V was well identified in all examined brain regions, and V calculated from the first 90 min of scan data fell within 10%. V was highest in thalamus and striatum, broadly matching human brain RNA expression. Wholebody imaging in the two humans and one monkey was notable for early distribution in the blood pool, accumulation in target organs (i.e., brain, lung), and excretion via urinary tract. Doses in the two humans were 19.6 and 19.3 muSV/MBq, respectively, similar to the value extrapolated from monkey (16.5 muSv/MBq). In monkey blocking scans, both drugs substantially blocked brain uptake; at 60 min, rolipram blocked 78% of uptake and PF-06445974 blocked 92%. However, for the rolipram-blocked scan, radioactivity in brain increased after 20 min and returned to baseline by the end of the scan. Rats showed a similar pattern to monkey. To assess whether this was due to radiometabolite in brain or rapid rolipram clearance, a second rolipram dose was injected as a displacing agent at 120 min in a rat that had undergone pre-injection of 1 mg/kg iv. This repeat rolipram dose replenished rolipram concentrations in brain and restored its ability to block radioligand binding, proving that no radiometabolite entered rat or monkey brain. Conclusion(s): [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 successfully imaged and quantified PDE4B in human brain. No radiometabolite contamination occurred, reflecting parent radioligand binding to PDE4 in brain. In nonhuman primates,, rolipram washed out more quickly than PF-06445974. Fig.1 In human brain, [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 had widespread distribution, with high uptake in striatum and thalamus. Fig.2 In human brain, two-tissue compartment modeling with plasma parent input was well-fitted (A). Distribution volume (V ) was well identified and stable (B).",Excluded
4170,"Collateral damage of radiation to normal tissues: What can the retina tell us? Purpose : Damage to normal tissue in an irradiated field (normal tissue injury, NTI) is a complication of radiation therapy believed to be caused by microvessel pathology. In the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS), vascular pathology was described in uveal melanoma (UM) patients 2 years post-radiation therapy. However, the COMS and other studies used subjective scoring systems, lacked a control group, did not assess neuronal function in detail, and used dosimetry methods simplified for clinical application. Methods : Optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCT-A) was used to characterize vascular pathology by vessel density, fractal dimension (FD), lacunarity, foveal avascular zone (FAZ) size, parafoveal density (PVD), and by machine learning-derived density maps. OCT-derived retinal layer thickness and 10-2 visual field testing (VF) were used to quantify corresponding neuronal loss and dysfunction. Patient-specific 3D dosimetry models were constructed to spatially correlate dose to each outcome measure. Measurements were taken in both eyes of 31 UM patients at 0.5-150 mo post-<sup>125</sup>I plaque brachytherapy, and 16 age-matched controls. Data were normalized to the contralateral eye to account for subject variation due to age or systemic disease. Results : Abnormal vessel density, FD, lacunarity, FAZ size, and PVD were observed after 24 mo in 25 out of 31 subjects, whereas only 6 subjects showed any vascular pathology before 24 mo. Visual acuity was the least sensitive indicator of adverse outcome, with only 16% of the entire population showing a visual decline of two or more Snellen lines since diagnosis. Neuronal dysfunction by VF correlated strongly with most measures, especially vessel density, thinning of the superficial retina, and radiation dose (p<0.001). Abnormalities were observed only at doses above 20 Gy. Conclusions : Using a series of quantitative approaches, radiation microvasculopathy was detected starting at 24 mo post-exposure in most patients. Strong correlations between loss of neuronal function, vascular pathology, and dose were observed. Prospective studies will help determine whether vascular pathology precedes neuronal loss.",Included

4167,"Time Dependence of Radiation-induced Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis Dysfunction in Adults Treated for Non-pituitary, Intracranial Neoplasms AIMS: Hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) dysfunction is a sequela of cranial radiotherapy. The purpose of this study was to use endocrine data from existing publications to characterise the baseline endocrine status, the effects of radiotherapy on the HPA during the first follow-up year and the time dependence of radiation-induced HPA dysfunction in patients treated with radiotherapy for non-pituitary intracranial neoplasms.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search of databases was carried out for articles that reported the results of endocrine testing for patients aged 16 years and older who were treated with neurosurgery for non-pituitary intracranial neoplasms or radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal neoplasms. To analyse the radiotherapy-related changes in hormone levels over time, long-term prospective endocrine data from nasopharyngeal studies were normalised to baseline hormone data and fitted to an exponential decay model. This process was repeated with normalisation to year 1 hormone data.RESULTS: Eight unique articles met eligibility criteria. HPA dysfunction occurred in 21.6-64.7% of patients who were assessed for endocrinopathies following neurosurgery. Studies on the early effects of radiotherapy on nasopharyngeal patients showed statistically significant changes in growth hormone, luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels during the first year of follow-up. Time dependence modelling showed that normalisation to year 1 hormone levels yield exponential equations with stronger measures of goodness of fit.CONCLUSION: HPA dysfunction in patients treated for non-pituitary intracranial neoplasms is probably a result of both neurosurgery and radiotherapy treatments. Although statistically significant endocrine changes can occur during this first year of follow-up, those documented at year 1 may be more predictive of subsequent HPA dysfunction.",Excluded

3624,"Medical Event Management for Future Deep Space Exploration Missions to Mars BACKGROUND: Long-duration exploration missions (LDEMs), such as voyages to Mars, will present unique medical challenges for astronaut crews, including communication delays and the inability to return to Earth early. Medical events threaten crewmember lives and increase the risk of mission failure. Managing a range of potential medical events will require excellent technical and nontechnical skills (NTSs). We sought to identify medical events with potential for rescue, range them according to the potential impact on crew health and mission success during LDEMs, and develop a list of NTSs to train for management of in-flight medical events.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight subject matter experts with specializations in surgery, medicine, trauma, spaceflight operations, NTS training, simulation, human factors, and organizational psychology completed online surveys followed by a 2-d in-person workshop. They identified and rated medical events for survivability, mission impact, and impact of crewmember NTSs on outcomes in space.RESULTS: Sudden cardiac arrest, smoke inhalation, toxic exposure, seizure, and penetrating eye injury emerged as events with the highest potential mission impact, greatest potential for survival, and that required excellent NTS for successful management. Key NTS identified to target in training included information exchange, supporting behavior, communication delivery, and team leadership/followership.CONCLUSIONS: With a planned Mars mission on the horizon, training countermeasures need to be developed in the next 3-5 y. These results may inform policy, selection, medical system design, and training scenarios for astronauts to manage in-flight medical events on LDEMs. Findings may extend to surgical and medical care in any rural and remote location.",Excluded

Even less common is skull base involvement of RDD, with only 41 reported cases. Radiographically, RDD can appear very similar to a meningioma, and RDD can only be diagnosed with tissue biopsy. This ""benign"" condition can cause significant neurologic morbidity both from the disease and unnecessary surgical treatment of the disease. Although rare, generally intracranial RDD has been treated with chemotherapy or radiation with limited role for surgery to relieve mass effect. Surgical approaches to the skull base are invasive and pose risk, especially for a benign and self-limiting disease like RDD. Presented, is the case of a 63-year-old woman with a presumed spheno-cavernous meningioma that was previously radiated without tissue diagnosis. In the interim, she was diagnosed with RDD by her dermatologist after skin biopsy. Upon presentation, the patient was experiencing retroorbital headaches and blurry vision, and MR imaging demonstrated progression of her lesion. On examination she had mild right proptosis and a partial Cranial Nerve III palsy. For these reasons, surgical biopsy was undertaken with the goal of orbital and optic nerve decompressions. An endoscopic endonasal unilateral approach was performed to sample tissue at the superior orbital fissure, with bony decompression of the orbit and optic canal.

4585,"Radial vs femoral approach: Does access point influence occupational radiation head dose to scrub nurses? Background: There has been a notable trend towards using a radial approach during cardiac angiography in recent years. Studies show that irrespective of dose, cranial irradiation increases the risk of developing meningiomas by up to 10-fold [1,2], hence head dose monitoring should be a priority for departments. Objective(s): This study sought to determine whether head dose to operators and scrub nurses was affected by the choice of arterial access route. Method(s): A prospective study was performed over a period of 8 months monitoring the head dose to in-room personnel during both diagnostic and interventional coronary angiography cases. Data were collected using electronic detectors worn on the left temple by staff. The correlation between head dose to operating physician and the scrub nurse for both femoral and radial access points was evaluated. Result(s): The head dose to scrub nurses was significantly higher during radial cases compared with femoral access.

Further investigation is warranted to determine possible reasons for the increase in dose in radial access cases.",Excluded
4154,"Extracranial carotid stenosis after radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a Malaysian study Background and objectives: Radiation treatment in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is known to be associated with increased prevalence of carotid stenosis. The objectives of the study was to determine the prevalence of radiation-induced extracranial carotid stenosis, plaque, carotid intima thickness (CIMT) in NPC patients; to explore whether the stenosis is due to direct effect of radiation rather than general tendency to atherosclerosis. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the University Malaya Medical Centre from July 2011 to February 2012. The study subjects consisted of 47 NPC patients who were treated with radiation, and 47 healthy control. The patients and control had carotid duplex ultrasound and transcranial Doppler (TCD). Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 55.1 years, the time lapse from radiation was 76.7 +/- 95.3 months. Internal carotid artery (ICA) and common carotid artery (CCA) stenosis of >=50% was seen in 17.0% of patients vs 2.1 % of controls (p = 0.031), with 61.7% of patients and 19.1% of controls having plaque in ICA and CCA (p=0.004). CIMT was increased in 70.2% of patients and 44.7% of controls (p =0.022). Both the patient group and control had similar rate of intracranial stenosis of 12.8% in TCD. Conclusion(s): Extracranial internal carotid artery is the most common site of stenosis following radiotherapy in NPC. This suggests that local trauma from irradiation is the most important factor in predisposition to atherosclerosis following radiation therapy.",Included

3992,"Primary care of the patient with cancer Care of patients with cancer can be enhanced by continued involvement of the primary care physician. The physician's role may include informing the patient of the diagnosis, helping with decisions about treatment, providing psychological support, treating intercurrent disease, continuing patient-appropriate preventive care, and recognizing and managing or comanaging complications of cancer and cancer therapies. Adverse effects of therapy and cancer-related symptoms include nausea, febrile neutropenia, pain, fatigue, depression, and emotional distress. 5-Hydroxytryptamine antagonists are effective in controlling acute nausea associated with chemotherapy. Febrile neutropenia requires systematic evaluation and early empiric antibiotics while awaiting culture results. Cancer-related pain, depression, and fatigue often are underdiagnosed and undertreated. Use of brief screening tools for assessing fatigue and emotional distress can improve management of these symptoms. Exercise prescription, activity management, and psychosocial interventions are useful in treating cancer-related fatigue.

3828,"Correlating radiographical and pathological response to immunotherapy in primary brain tumors Objective: The radiographic response of primary brain tumors to immunotherapy is poorly understood. This study investigates the imaging and pathological characteristics of primary brain tumors after exposure to immunotherapy. Background(s): Immunotherapy amplifies the innate immune response to solid cancers. For example, inhibitors of immune checkpoints PD-1 and CTLA-4 block signals to inhibitory T cells, thus increasing the T-cell mediated response to non-self antigens. In prior studies, a subset of systemic cancers treated with immunotherapy demonstrate radiographic worsening prior to pathological/clinical response to treatment. While this phenomenon of ""pseudo-progression"" has been described in primary brain tumors after temozolomide and radiation, the radiographic response to immunotherapy is poorly characterized. Design/Methods: Inclusion criteria are 1) primary brain cancer diagnosis, 2) second resection, and 3) use of immunotherapy prior to re-resection. ""Immunotherapy"" includes PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors, or dendritic cell vaccines. Patients can utilize other chemotherapies and/or tumor treating fields, concurrently. Radiographical response on MRI is defined by RANO (Response Assessment in Neuro- Oncology) criteria. Pathological diagnosis is defined by WHO criteria. Result(s): At our center, 90 patients with primary brain cancers received immunotherapy during the course of cancer treatment. 10 of these patients (9 glioblastoma and 1 anaplastic astrocytoma) had re-resection after initiation of immunotherapy, with radiographical progression at 0.6-9.6 months, and repeat resection at 0.7-12.6 months. Of the 10 patients, resection pathology was characterized as predominantly treatment effect in 4 patients, and predominantly recurrent tumor in 6 patients. Further analysis will be done to characterize the molecular and genetic characteristics of resection tissue. Conclusion(s): Given promise in other cancer fields, immunotherapy is becoming increasingly popular in the treatment of primary brain cancer. In this limited case series, 4 out of 10 patients treated with immunotherapy had radiographic progression without significant pathologic progression. This suggests that immunotherapy may be continued past radiographic progression.",Excluded
4683,"Radiotherapy of the neck and carotid stenosis The first choice of treatment for neck cancer is often radiotherapy. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the microinflammation after radiotherapy of the neck and the incidence of carotid stenosis. This study reports on patients treated with radiotherapy as part of the treatment for laryngeal cancer in the Department of Radiation Oncology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, P.R. China. Sixty-two males and nine females were treated with radiotherapy between 2006 and 3012. The carotid diameter was determined by measuring carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in the common, external and internal carotid artery. Microinflammatory conditions were assessed by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Other studied risk factors included age, treatment modalities, radiation dose and energy, the height of the radiation field, and follow-up time. Carotid stenosis was detected in all of the 71 patients. It was mainly clinically unsuspected; 19 patients had sustained a vascular event (14 TIA, 5 CVI) at a median of 3.11 years (range 2.3-5.6 years) following RT. In four of five CVI patients, CVI occurred on the side of the irradiation. Eleven patients who suffered vascular incident had severe stenosis of the carotid artery and 6 had moderate (31-49% of the lumen). Only two patients with mild stenosis on the irradiated side suffered TIAs. Serum hs-CRP levels in carotid stenosis were 9.4 (+/-SD=5.97) mg/ml, IL-6 = 12.8 (+/-SD=2.62) pg/ml and TNF-alpha = 15.4 (+/-SD=4.49) ng/ml. The clinical detection of asymptomatic carotid stenosis is challenging, and current recommendations regarding the follow-up period should be scrutinized.",Excluded
3885,"A novel LITT treatment planning system to optimize laser ablation delivery to brain targets Purpose: Laser interstitial thermal therapy, or LITT, is a minimally invasive stereotactic tumor ablative technique. One application is treating intracranial targets. LITT systems use a laser energy probe that can be inserted into the patient, emitting near infrared laser radiation that induces necrosis in clinical targets while providing thermal damage updates via MR thermometry. The rigid laser probes range two and three mm in diameter, through which the thermal energy efficiently emits along straight-line pathways. The systems allow for varying dwell times and rates of energy deposition to assist in the ability to maximize the thermal damage to the target tissues while minimizing the damage to normal tissues. For targets that cannot be treated along a linear trajectory, multiple trajectories are necessary. However, planning systems, like those available in ionizing radiation delivery, are all but absent from the clinical setting. The goals of this project aim to provide a planning system to allow the optimization of the laser trajectory. Method(s): Twelve patients who underwent LITT therapy using traditional approaches, where the surgeon decided on laser trajectory by inspection of orthogonal radiology images were post procedure planned using a rudimentary system of LITT planning. Starting with a stereotactic planning system, a thermal dose kernel was developed. This effort has provided a rudimentary tool that yields first estimates for optimized LITT. Result(s): A conformal index was developed and evaluated for each planning technique. The average index for the simple inspection of orthogonal images based on thermal dose threshold lines was 88.4% while the conformal index of the planning system were 46.2%. Conclusion(s): As with ionizing radiation, it is anticipated that this increase in thermal optimization will translate into better tumor control and lower complications. A system, with a more precise thermal predictive algorithm and automated trajectory planning is being pursued.",Excluded
4718,"Patterns of care and outcomes after computed tomography scans for headache BACKGROUND: concerns exist about potential overuse of computed tomography (CT) scans for headache in ambulatory care.METHODS: we sought to examine health services use, brain tumor diagnosis, and death during the year after CT scanning for headache by linking records of an audit of 3930 outpatient CT brain scans performed in 2005 in Ontario, Canada, to administrative databases.RESULTS: of 623 patients receiving CT scans for a sole indication of headache, few (2.1%) scans contained findings potentially causing their headache. For most patients, the index CT scan was the only one received over an 11-year period. However, 28.4% of patients received 1 or more CT brain scans during the preceding decade and 6.7% received 1 or more CT brain scans during the subsequent year. Of the 473 patients (75.9%) whose index scan was ordered by a primary care physician, most (80.3%) did not see a specialist during follow-up. One patient with an indeterminate finding on the index scan was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor (0.2%), and 6 patients (1.0%) died during follow-up. Among the 4 deaths in which the cause could be determined, none were due to central nervous system causes.CONCLUSION: because of the potential risk of cancer from exposure to ionizing radiation, efforts should be made to avoid CT scanning for headache when the likelihood of serious illness is low. Evidence-based decision rules that identify which patients with headache do not require neuroimaging may decrease the use of CT scans in situations of little benefit.",Excluded
4792,"Multiple primary malignancies of the thyroid gland and the brain: A case report A majority of studies have reported cases on patients with primary thyroid cancer who developed subsequent malignancies, following their initial thyroid cancer diagnosis. Notably glioma has been reported as a secondary cancer following thyroid cancer diagnosis. A case of a 50-year-old woman with a history of thyroid nodules and symptom of throat discomfort is reported in the present study. A fine needle aspiration of the thyroid nodules confirmed the presence of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The patient received a total thyroidectomy followed by iodine 131 (<sup>131</sup>I) treatment. The patient was admitted to the hospital following 5 years of the initial treatment, due to headache and nausea. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head region revealed an irregular lesion at the left temporal lobe. Following frontal tumor resection, the biopsy revealed brain astrocytoma. Postoperatively, the patient underwent intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) at a total dose of 60 Gy in combination with oral temozolo-mide chemotherapy. The frequency of radiation treatment was 2 Gy/day x30 fractions. The data are not conclusive of a correlation between the incidence of glioma and<sup>131</sup>I treatment. But, the incidence of long-term survival of the patients with thyroid cancer and second primary cancer warrants considerable attention by medical professionals.

4639,"Lack of the alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 1 causes tremors, seizures, and early postnatal death in mice The Na(+)-independent alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 1 (Asc-1) is exclusively expressed in neuronal structures throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Asc-1 transports small neutral amino acids with high affinity especially for D-serine and glycine (K(i): 8-12 microM), two endogenous glutamate co-agonists that activate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors through interacting with the strychnine-insensitive glycine binding-site. By regulating D-serine (and possibly glycine) levels in the synaptic cleft, Asc-1 may play an important role in controlling neuronal excitability. We generated asc-1 gene knockout (asc-1(-/-)) mice to test this hypothesis. Behavioral phenotyping combined with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings revealed that asc-1(-/-) mice developed tremors, ataxia, and seizures that resulted in early postnatal death. Both tremors and seizures were reduced by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. Extracellular recordings from asc-1(-/-) brain slices indicated that the spontaneous seizure activity did not originate in the hippocampus, although, in this region, a relative increase in evoked synaptic responses was observed under nominal Mg(2+)-free conditions. Taken together with the known neurochemistry and neuronal distribution of the Asc-1 transporter, these results indicate that the mechanism underlying the behavioral hyperexcitability in mutant mice is likely due to overactivation of NMDA receptors, presumably resulting from elevated extracellular D-serine. Our study provides the first evidence to support the notion that Asc-1 transporter plays a critical role in regulating neuronal excitability, and indicate that the transporter is vital for normal CNS function and essential to postnatal survival of mice.",Excluded
3667,"Spinal robotics: current applications and future perspectives Even though robotic technology holds great potential for performing spinal surgery and advancing neurosurgical techniques, it is of utmost importance to establish its practicality and to demonstrate better clinical outcomes compared with traditional techniques, especially in the current cost-effective era.

However, workflow, usability, interdisciplinary setups, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness have to be proven prospectively. This article includes a short description of robotic structures and workflow, followed by preliminary results of a randomized prospective study comparing conventional free-hand techniques with routine spine navigation and robotic-assisted procedures. Additionally, we present cases performed with a spinal robotic device, assessing not only the accuracy of the robotic-assisted procedure but also other factors (eg, minimal invasiveness, radiation dosage, and learning curves). Currently, the use of robotics in spinal surgery greatly enhances the application of minimally invasive procedures by increasing accuracy and reducing radiation exposure for patients and surgeons compared with standard procedures. Second-generation hardware and software upgrades of existing devices will enhance workflow and intraoperative setup.

4648,"Control of brain metastases from radioresistant tumors treated by stereotactic radiosurgery Renal cell carcinoma, sarcoma, and melanoma are considered to be ""radioresistant"" tumor histologies. Brain metastases (BM) from these tumors are considered unlikely to be controlled using the relatively low doses used in whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Our objective was to analyze the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on local control and overall survival of BM from radioresistant primary tumors. We reviewed all patients who received Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) for BM at Columbia University Medical Center between January 2009 and April 2014. All patients were treated using the Gamma Knife Perfexion System. Dosimetric data was collected from treatment plans and metastases were categorized as radioresistant or not. Response was assessed by reviewing follow-up brain imaging studies and classified according to RECIST. Local control and median overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. In total, 373 tumors were analyzed from 126 patients. Of these tumors, 49 (13.1 %) originated from radioresistant cancers. The overall local control rate in the radioresistant cohort was 89.8 and 90.1 % in the non-radioresistant cohort. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that radioresistance status of the primary tumor had no statistically significant effect on local control with hazard ratios of 1.0 (p = 1.0, 95 % CI 0.388-2.576) and 0.954 (p = 0.926, 95 % CI 0.349-2.603) respectively. Median overall survival for both radioresistant and non-radioresistant cohorts was 20.0 months, with a p value of 0.926. There was no significant difference in local control of BM from radioresistant and non-radioresistant primary tumors treated with GKRS. Both cohorts showed excellent response and local control, suggesting that SRS upfront or in addition to WBRT may be an appropriate strategy in the treatment of BM from radioresistant cancers. Median overall survival for both cohorts was equal, suggesting that improved local control may be associated with an improvement in long-term survival.",Excluded
4204,"Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma.METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival.RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD.CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume.",Excluded
4012,"Surface chemistry governs cellular tropism of nanoparticles in the brain Nanoparticles are of long-standing interest for the treatment of neurological diseases such as glioblastoma. Most past work focused on methods to introduce nanoparticles into the brain, suggesting that reaching the brain interstitium will be sufficient to ensure therapeutic efficacy. However, optimized nanoparticle design for drug delivery to the central nervous system is limited by our understanding of their cellular deposition in the brain. Here, we investigated the cellular fate of poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles presenting different surface chemistries, after administration by convection-enhanced delivery. We demonstrate that nanoparticles with 'stealth' properties mostly avoid internalization by all cell types, but internalization can be enhanced by functionalization with bio-adhesive end-groups. We also show that association rates measured in cultured cells predict the extent of internalization of nanoparticles in cell populations. Finally, evaluating therapeutic efficacy in an orthotopic model of glioblastoma highlights the need to balance significant uptake without inducing adverse toxicity.",Excluded

TSPO imaging is expected to be useful for the clinical evaluation of neuroinflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to provide dosimetry estimates for [(18)F]FEDAA1106 based on human whole-body PET measurements.METHODS: PET scans were performed for a total of 6.6 h after the injection of 183.8 +/- 9.1 MBq of [(18)F]FEDAA1106 in six healthy subjects. Regions of interest were drawn on coronal images. Estimates of the absorbed doses of radiation were calculated using the OLINDA software.RESULTS: Peak uptake was largest in lungs, followed by liver, small intestine, kidney, spleen and other organs. Peak values of the percent injected dose (%ID) at a time after radioligand injection were calculated for the lungs (27.1%ID at 0.2 h), liver (21.1%ID at 0.6 h), small intestine (10.4%ID at 6.3 h), kidney (4.9%ID at 1.8 h) and spleen (4.6%ID at 0.6 h). The largest absorbed dose was found in the spleen (0.12 mSv/MBq), followed by kidneys (0.094 mSv/MBq). The calculated mean effective dose was 0.036 mSv/MBq.CONCLUSION: Based on the distribution and dose estimates, the estimated radiation burden of [(18)F]FEDAA1106 is moderately higher than that of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). In clinical studies, the administered activity of this radioligand ought to be adjusted in line with regional regulations.

Copepod adaptations for long duration exposures include changes in behaviour, changes in pigmentation and ultimately changes in morphology. Adaptations to short-term exposures are little studied. Here we show that short-duration exposure to UVR causes the freshwater calanoid copepod, Eudiaptomus gracilis, to rapidly activate production of enzymes that prevent widespread collateral peroxidation (glutathione S-transferase, GST), that regulate apoptosis cell death (Caspase-3, Casp-3), and that facilitate neurotransmissions (cholinesterase-ChE). None of these enzyme systems is alone sufficient, but they act in concert to reduce the stress level of the organism.

3737,"Influence of backscatter radiation on cranial reconstruction implants Objective: We aimed to evaluate backscatter dose variations in different cranial bone implant materials in an experimental model designed to simulate postoperative radiotherapy. Method(s): We assessed the radiation backscatter doses associated with sheet- and mesh-type titanium plates and hydroxyapatite (HAP) samples (porosity: 35%, 50% and 85%). The samples were irradiated with 6- and 10-MV photon beams from a linear accelerator. Measurements were obtained using an ionization chamber and radiochromic films cut from the same batch. Result(s): At 6MV, the titanium sheet showed the highest peak for backscattered radiation, followed by (in decreasing order) HAP30%, HAP50%, titanium mesh and HAP85%. At 10MV, HAP30% showed the highest peak, followed by HAP50%, titanium sheet, titanium mesh and HAP85%. The peaks were at different depths in the titanium and HAP samples. The thickness of the human scalp is approximately 7mm; therefore, measurements were obtained 0-7mm above the implants to assess the likely dose on the scalp. A comparison of the maximum dose on the scalp showed the titanium sheet had the highest dose at both 6 and 10MV. Conclusion(s): The backscatter dose differed with the density of the material and the backscatter depth was different for each material. Advances in knowledge: Ulcer formation due to radiotherapy after brain tumour depends on not only radiation but also the implant material.

4455,"The coupling between synaptic vesicles and Ca2+ channels determines fast neurotransmitter release In order to release neurotransmitter synchronously in response to a presynaptic action potential, synaptic vesicles must be both release competent and located close to presynaptic Ca2+ channels. It has not been shown, however, which of the two is the more decisive factor. We tested this issue at the calyx of Held synapse by combining Ca2+ uncaging and electrophysiological measurements of postsynaptic responses. After depletion of the synaptic vesicles that are responsible for synchronous release during action potentials, uniform elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by Ca2+ uncaging could still elicit rapid release. The Ca2+ sensitivity of remaining vesicles was reduced no more than 2-fold, which is insufficient to explain the slow-down of the kinetics of release (10-fold) observed during a depolarizing pulse. We conclude that recruitment of synaptic vesicles to sites where Ca2+ channels cluster, rather than fusion competence, is a limiting step for rapid neurotransmitter release in response to presynaptic action potentials.",Excluded

4205,"Light Stress-Induced Increase of Sphingosine 1-Phosphate in Photoreceptors and Its Relevance to Retinal Degeneration Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent lipid mediator that modulates inflammation and angiogenesis. In this study, we investigated the possible involvement of S1P in the pathology of light-induced retinal degeneration in vivo and in vitro. The intracellular S1P and sphingosine kinase (SphK) activity in a photoreceptor cell line (661W cells) was significantly increased by exposure to light. The enhancement of SphK1 expression was dependent on illumination, and all-trans-retinal significantly promoted SphK1 expression. S1P treatment reduced protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation and increased the protein expression of cleaved caspase-3, and induced photoreceptor cell apoptosis. In vivo, light exposure enhanced the expression of SphK1 in the outer segments of photoreceptors. Intravitreal injection of a SphK inhibitor significantly suppressed the thinning of the outer nuclear layer and ameliorated the attenuation of the amplitudes of a-waves and b-waves of electroretinograms during light-induced retinal degeneration. These findings imply that light exposure induces the synthesis of S1P in photoreceptors by upregulating SphK1, which is facilitated by all-trans-retinal, causing retinal degeneration.

Patients were 20 to 70 years of age and had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1. The radiotherapy protocol consisted of whole-pelvis external beam radiotherapy and HDR-ICBT. The cumulative linear quadratic equivalent dose (EQD2) was 62 to 65 Gy prescribed at point A. Cisplatin was administered weekly at a dose of 40 mg/m(2) for 5 courses.RESULTS: Between March 2008 and January 2009, 72 patients from 25 institutions were enrolled, and 71 patients were eligible and evaluable for compliance and severe toxicity. The median age of the patients was 57 years (range, 32-70 years). Sixty-five patients (92%) received the planned 5 courses of chemotherapy. Four patients had cisplatin dose reduction according to the protocol. Radiotherapy was completed per protocol in 68 patients (96%). Median overall treatment time was 50 days (range, 37-66 days). The following grade 3 or 4 acute adverse events were observed: neutropenia in 31 patients (44%), anemia in 10 patients (14%), diarrhea in 4 patients (6%), and anorexia in 3 patients (4%).CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with HDR-ICBT and standard weekly delivery of cisplatin was feasible with acceptable toxicity in Japanese patients with cervical cancer.",Excluded
3825,"3D cerebral angiography: radiation dose comparison with digital subtraction angiography BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As the use of 3D rotational angiography (3D RA) for the evaluation of cerebral vasculature becomes more widespread, it is important to evaluate this imaging method's effect on patient radiation dose. The purpose of the study is to measure 3D RA radiation dose as compared with biplanar digital subtraction angiography (DSA). METHOD(S): The distribution and peak skin dose were measured for 3D RA and biplanar DSA by using an anthropomorphic skull phantom. In addition, the cumulative incident dose, summed over all images in each acquisition, was determined. Measurements were acquired for our facility's standard 3D RA acquisition mode (25 degrees /s rotational speed; 162 total frames) and other available acquisition mode selections. RESULT(S): For 3D RA, the skin dose was found to be distributed across the back and sides of the skull with the peak skin dose located at the center of the back of the skull. The peak skin dose for the standard 3D RA acquisition mode was 15 mGy. For a biplanar DSA run, the peak skin dose was 58 mGy, also located at the back of the skull. The cumulative incident dose for the standard 3D RA acquisition mode was 33 mGy, compared with 53 mGy for biplanar DSA. CONCLUSION(S): The patient radiation dose for 3D RA is significantly lower than for biplanar DSA, by nearly a factor of 4 in peak skin dose and 40% lower in cumulative incident dose.",Excluded
3684,"Acute impairment of saccadic eye movement is associated with cerebral infarction after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage Introduction Cerebral infarction due to delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Damage to the brain in the first 72 hours (""early brain injury"") is likely to play a key pathophysiological role but remains difficult to quantify objectively and noninvasively at the bedside-especially in those patients who do not require sedation or ventilation. Current diagnostic modalities used in routine clinical practice are either invasive, require ionising radiation or contrast or have a high learning curve and user variability. Objectives We sought to determine whether saccadic eye movements are impaired following SAH and whether measurement of saccadic latency (SL) in the acute period post-aneurysm rupture is associated with the likelihood of developing DCI in patients after SAH. Methods 24 male/female patients (mean age 53.32, range 31-70) with World Federation of Neurosurgeons (WFNS) grade I and II aneurysmal SAH, treated endovascularly within 72 hours of rupture were recruited. DCI and DCI-related cerebral infarction were defined as per consensus guidelines.1 Saccadometry data was collected at three time points: In the first 72 hours, between days 5 and 10 and at three months post-SAH. Data from 10 healthy age/gender matched controls was collected on one occasion for comparison. Results Age-adjusted median SL in patients was significantly prolonged in the first 72 hours post-SAH when compared to controls (188.7, 95 % CI = (176.9, 202.2)ms v 160.7, 95 % CI = (145.6, 179.4)ms, p = 0.0054 f-test). By 3 months post-SAH, there was no significant difference in median SL compared to controls (188.7, 95 % CI = (176.9, 202.2)ms v 180.0, 95 % CI = (165.1, 197.8)ms, p = 0.4175 f-test). Patients diagnosed with cerebral infarction due to DCI had a significantly higher age-adjusted median SL in the first 72 hours than those without infarction (240.6, 95 % CI = (216.7, 270.3)ms v 204.1, 95 % CI = (190.7, 219.5)ms, p = 0.0157 t-test). This difference was more pronounced during days 5-10 post-SAH-the peak incidence for DCI (303.7, 95 % CI = (266.7 352.7)ms v 207.6, 95 % CI = (193.7, 223.6)ms, p < 0.0001 t-test). A binary generalised linear model showed that median SL in the first 72 hours was the only significant predictor of cerebral infarction after SAH. Conclusions This is the first study to use saccadometry to measure eye movements in patients with SAH during the acute period post-rupture. Results show that median saccadic latency in the first 72 hours following SAH is an independent predictor of the risk of developing cerebral infarction due to DCI. Saccadometry may act as a potential objective biomarker of early brain injury to guide the need for intensive care admission and treatment. [Table Presented].",Excluded
3717,"Accurate assessment of long-term nephrotoxicity after therapy with <sup>177</sup>Lu-octreotate Objectives : Renal radiation during peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) may result in glomerular damage and reduction of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and eventually may lead to renal failure years after PRRT. Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance allow only an approximate estimation of the GFR. The aim of this study was an accurate assessment of long -term changes in GFR using the 99mTc-DTPA clearance. Of particular interest was the impact of pre-existing risk factors. Methods : GFR of 75 patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET) treated with <sup>177</sup>Lu-octreotate (4 intended cycles at 3 monthly intervals and mean activity of 7.9 GBq per cycle) were retrospectively analyzed. A minimum follow-up of 12 months was required for patient inclusion. Mean followup duration was 20 months (range 12-48 months), with a median of 5 GFR measurements per patient. The change of GFR was analyzed by linear curve fit. Potential risk factors including DM, HTN, previous chemotherapy and decreased renal function at baseline were analyzed regarding impact on the renal function loss. Comparability of nephrotoxicity determined by 99mTc-DTPA clearance and serum creatinine (using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0) was also investigated. Results : A reduction of >2 ml / year in GFR was observed in 31 (42%) and > 10ml/year in 16 patients (22%). The mean and median decline in GFR was 12 and 7 ml per year respectively. However, only one patient developed serious nephrotoxicity (CTCAE grade III). Eleven patients showed an increase of > 10 ml/year in GFR following PRRT. Nephrotoxicity graded according to serum creatinine (CTCAE) was not compatible with GFR in 17% of the assessments and was underestimated by serum creatinine in 12% of patients. None of the investigated risk factors contributed to a reduction in GFR. Conclusions : Severe nephrotoxicity after PRRT with <sup>177</sup>Lu-octrotate is rare (1.3 % of patients). However, mild renal function impairment (> 2 ml/year) is common and best monitored with 99mTc-DTPA clearance.",Excluded
4104,"Stress response of a p53 homologue in the radioresistant Sf9 insect cells PURPOSE: To investigate homology and stress response of p53 (a 53 kDa tumor suppressor protein) orthologue in Sf9 Lepidopteran insect cell line that exhibits very high radioresistance.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Western immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, degenerate RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay, flow cytometry and immuno-fluorescence microscopy were used for characterizing structural and functional features of Sfp53 (Spodoptera frugiperda p53) in gamma-irradiated or etoposide-treated Sf9 insect and BMG-1 (brain malignant glioma) human cells. Cells were pre-treated with caffeine for inhibiting ATM/ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein/ATM and Rad-3-related protein) activation, wherever required.RESULTS: A 47-49 kDa protein band was observed with antibodies against three different epitopes, demonstrating conservation of respective domains in Sfp53. Immunoprecipitation also yielded similar-sized protein. Degenerate RT-PCR resulted in product of same size in both cell lines. Similar gel mobility shift of p53-binding oligonucleotide with BMG-1 and Sf9 cell lysates indicated analogous transcriptional activity of Sfp53. Constitutive Sfp53 level was higher than hp53 (human p53) and showed primarily cytoplasmic localization. Radiation-induced accumulation was considerably less in Sf9 even as an analogous ATM/ATR-dependent nuclear translocation was observed following gamma-irradiation and etoposide.CONCLUSIONS: A smaller-sized Sfp53 orthologue shows highly conserved native structure with DNA-binding, N-terminus and C-terminus domains, and has analogous p53 transcriptional activity. While its nuclear translocation and ATM/ATR dependence were similar to hp53, the cytoplasmic localization and subdued accumulation following gamma-irradiation indicate functional differences from human cells.",Included

The search for reliable markers of the disease that could be used for non invasive diagnostics is constantly needed. One of the hypotheses for gait impairment in NPH is the affection of periventricular white matter. METHODS In this study 15 patients were investigated for possible NPH. All patients underwent diagnostic testing (lumbar infusion test and 5 days of external lumbar drainage for diagnosis of NPH). Only the patients with positive diagnostic response were included in the study (n=10), all patients with postive response were finally treated by venriculoperitoneal shunt. All patients underwent MRI examination including T2W, T1W and DTI sequence of the whole brain in axial sections (EPI, TR/TE=12,000/ 89.4 ms, 40 slices with thickness of 2,4 mm, no gap, 128x 128 matrix, FOV 24x24 cm2; along 30 noncollinear gradient directions with b value of 1000 s/mm2, with additional five b=0 images). Anatomical 3D T1W sequence was also acquired. Twenty age matched subjects with Alzheimer disease resulting in marked atrophia and venricular dilatation, without clinical signs of NPH were examined with the same technique. Following parameters were then manually measured: fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in fornix, splenium of corpus callosum, genu of the internal capsule, and optic radiation. The ROIs were placed two slices above the slice where anterior comissure could be detected. A Mann Whitney U test was used for the analysis of the results. Tract based spatial statistics method (TBSS) was also used. RESULTS The fractional anisotropy was decreased significantly in the NPH patient group compared to the controls (p<0,01) in fornix, right genu of the capsula interna and left optical radiation (p< 0,05), the data showed some trend (p<0,1) in ADC of the left and right optical radiation. The results were similar using TBSS. CONCLUSION The DTI measurements may reveal the white matter structural imparirment in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus.

The former preparation failed to show the same action. Its effect was close to that of thymocytes. When the recipients exposed to lethal irradiation were administered the RAMBS-treated bone marrow cells and one of the peptides, it was shown that in concomitant administration, thymohexin and thymocytes lost their ability to restore colony formation by RAMBS-treated bone marrow. Thymogen did not suppress the stimulating activity of thymocytes.

A laser beam divergence in the optical stimulation pathway exists, which may affect stimulation efficiency and spatial selectivity.METHODS: The fiberoptic collimation technique was proposed for cochlear neuron stimulation, and the C-lens element was designed as the collimation structure. The spiral ganglion cells in deafened guinea pigs' cochlea were irradiated with collimated and uncollimated near-infrared lasers. Optically evoked auditory brainstem response (OABR) under the two laser output modes were recorded.RESULTS: Laser with the collimation technique evoked an average 58% higher OABR amplitude than the uncollimated laser output. In addition, the collimated laser setup consumed on average 35.2% of laser energy compared with the uncollimated laser when evoking the same OABR amplitude.CONCLUSIONS: The fiberoptic collimation technique improved stimulation efficiency and reduced stimulating energy consumption in near-infrared neural stimulation in cochlea. The positive effects of laser collimation technique could benefit further research in optically based cochlear implants.",Excluded
4039,"Fast acquisition cone-beam computed tomography: Initial experience with a 10 s protocol Background Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) facilitates the acquisition of cross-sectional imaging in angiography suites using a rotational C-arm and digital flat panel detectors. The applications are numerous, including evaluation of implanted devices and localization of cerebrovascular lesions. We present and validate the clinical utility of an alternative fast CBCT acquisition protocol in the context of neurovascular device imaging. Methods Contrast-enhanced (CE)-CBCT images were acquired using a new 10 s protocol in a phantom head model, swine model, and in patients. The acquisition parameters of both the 10 s and 20 s protocols were exactly the same, except for fewer projections (250 projections in 10 s vs 500 projections in 20 s), resulting in reduced scan time. Image quality was measured quantitatively in a controlled phantom study and qualitatively by blinded reviewers. The latter was performed to assess the image quality of the 10 s protocol pertinent to the device visibility and its apposition to the parent artery. Results 10 s CBCT images were comparable to 20 s CBCT in both phantom and animal studies. Of the 25 patient images, the reviewers agreed that they were able to discern the flow diverter struts and assess the apposition in all images. The overall rating for all 10 s images was 4.28 on a 5-point scale. No images were rated as less than 3, which was the average diagnostic quality. The ratings were concordant across three blinded reviewers (kappa =0.411). Additionally, contrast and spatial resolution between 10 s and 20 s images were similar in non-human models. Conclusions CBCT images of neurovascular devices can be obtained successfully using a 10 s acquisition protocol. In addition, the 10 s protocol offers faster acquisition, thus allowing its use in awake patients and with an added advantage of lower radiation and contrast dose.

Method(s): HT and VMAT treatment plans were generated with a prescription dose of 30Gy/10 fractions in 16 patients treated with PCI. The dosimetry parameters of BHT, organs at risk (OARs), and planning target volume (PTV) were determined when the average dose of BHT was reduced by about 4Gy to serve as an observation point. Statistical plots were used to present dosimetry changing trends when sparing the BHT with both HT and VMAT technologies. Result(s): HT plans spared BHT V7.3Gy by up to 40%, with the average Dmean-BHT = 8.42+/-0.41Gy, while VMAT plans failed to spare BHT V7.3Gy by such an amount. HT authored significantly lower doses to OARs, including Dmean-BHT (HT 16.37Gy vs. VMAT 17.81Gy, P=0.03), Dmean-inner ear (P=0.02), Dmean-parotid glands (P=0.02), Dmax-lens (P=0.02), and Dmax-brainstem (P=0.02), except for Dmax-optic nerves (P=0.87), compared to VMAT. Also, compared to VMAT, HT plans provided better target coverage, with lower average D2% (P=0.02), higher average D98% (P=0.02), and better conformal index (0.87 vs. 0.84, P=0.02) and homogeneity index (0.15 vs. 0.21, P=0.05). With smaller BHT doses, the dose distribution to PTV occurred in three dosimetry regions for both HT and VMAT plans; the plateau region (>20.0Gy for HT vs >16.0Gy for VMAT), gradient region (20.0-12.0Gy vs 16.0-11.0Gy), and falling region (<12.0Gy vs <11.0Gy). The average delivery duration for HT was determined at almost 7.7 times longer than VMAT. Conclusion(s): Compared to VMAT, HT was better at sparing the BHT and OARs and had better target coverage but much longer treatment duration. More BHT dose decreases would yield worse target dose coverage, which would present a 'three regions' stair-stepping characteristic.",Excluded

3965,"A method for recording miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the central nervous system suitable for quantal analysis Quantal analysis of transmitter release is useful in examining presynaptic mechanisms involved in synaptic transmission. However, in central neurons, the presence of multiple synapses makes it difficult to use the traditional quantal analysis, developed for the neuromuscular transmission. We developed a method to minimize these difficulties. Experiments were performed, using the whole-cell patch-clamp recording technique, on rat CA1 pyramidal neurons in a hippocampal slice preparation. When the stratum radiatum was stimulated, mixed current signals including, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) and evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs), could be observed in CA1 pyramidal cells while slices were superfused with the normal, Na(+)-containing, medium. The mIPSCs could be blocked by bicuculline (10 microm). mEPSCs, eEPSCs and eIPSCs could not be observed when the Na(+)-containing perfusion medium was replaced by a Na(+)-free medium but reappeared when the Na(+)-containing medium was re-introduced. When a polarizing electrode was placed near the recorded neuron, while slices were superfused with the Na(+)-free medium, and depolarizing rectangular current pulses of different magnitudes were applied, the number of mIPSCs increased with increasing amount of the current. Amplitudes of the mIPSCs showed a Gaussian distribution and the coefficient of variation was small. These observations indicate that a combination of the Na(+)-free superfusing medium and local depolarizations with a polarizing electrode is useful for recording mIPSCs from a localized area of the recorded neuron and for quantal analysis.",Excluded

The functional roles and precise areas of termination of these axons have been a subject of recent controversy. The goals of this study were to identify spinothalamic tract neurons (STT) within the cervical enlargement that project to this area, characterize their responses to mechanical and thermal stimulation of their receptive fields, and use microantidromic tracking methods to determine the nuclei in which their axons terminate. Forty-seven neurons were antidromically activated using low-amplitude (< or =30 microA) current pulses in the contralateral posterior thalamus. The 51 points at which antidromic activation thresholds were lowest were surrounded by ineffective tracks indicating that the surrounded axons terminated within the posterior thalamus. The areas of termination were located primarily in the posterior triangular, medial geniculate, posterior and posterior intralaminar, and suprageniculate nuclei. Recording points were located in the superficial and deep dorsal horn. The mean antidromic conduction velocity was 6.4 m/s, a conduction velocity slower than that of other projections to the thalamus or hypothalamus in rats. Cutaneous receptive fields appeared to be smaller than those of neurons projecting to other areas of the thalamus or to the hypothalamus. Each of the examined neurons responded exclusively or preferentially to noxious stimuli. These findings indicate that the STT carries nociceptive information to several target nuclei within the posterior thalamus. We discuss the evidence that this projection provides nociceptive information that plays an important role in fear conditioning.",Excluded

Pathologically it is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neuronal loss within the brain tissue of affected individuals. It is now widely hypothesised that fibrillar structures represent an inert structure. Biophysical and toxicity assays attempting to characterize the formation of both the fibrillar and the intermediate oligomeric structures of Abeta typically involves preparing samples which are largely monomeric; the most common method by which this is achieved is to use the fluorinated organic solvent 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP). Recent evidence has suggested that this method is not 100% effective in producing an aggregate free solution. We show, using dynamic light scattering, size exclusion chromatography and small angle X-ray scattering that this is indeed the case, with HFIP pretreated Abeta peptide solutions displaying an increased proportion of oligomeric and aggregated material and an increased propensity to aggregate. Furthermore we show that an alternative technique, involving treatment with strong alkali results in a much more homogenous solution that is largely monomeric. These techniques for solubilising and controlling the oligomeric state of Abeta are valuable starting points for future biophysical and toxicity assays. Â© 2013 Ryan et al.",Excluded

Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed activation of rostral/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in normal subjects studied previously. Activity in this region was not significant in MS patients, but there was a large region of activity in superior temporal cortex.

4018,"Cholinergic responses in crossed tecto-reticular neurons of rat superior colliculus Neurons in the intermediate gray layer (SGI) of mammalian superior colliculus (SC) receive cholinergic innervation from the brain stem parabrachial region, which seems to modulate the signal processing in the SC. To clarify its role particularly in orienting behaviors, we studied cholinergic effects on the major output neuron group of the SGI, crossed tecto-reticular neurons (cTRNs), identified by retrograde labeling from the contralateral brain stem gaze center in SC slices obtained from rats (PND 17-22) by whole cell patch-clamp techniques. Bath application of carbachol induced either 1) nicotinic inward (nIN) + muscarinic inward (mIN) (11/24) or 2) nIN + mIN + muscarinic outward (mOUT) (13/24) current responses. Transient pressure application of 1 mM acetylcholine elicited nIN in all neurons tested (n = 58). In a majority of these neurons (52/58), the nIN was completely suppressed by dihydro-beta-erythroidine, a specific antagonist for alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor subtype. The remaining 6/58 neurons exhibited not only the slower alpha4beta2 receptor-mediated component but also a faster component that was inhibited by a specific antagonist for alpha7 nicotinic receptor, alpha-bungarotoxin. cTRNs expressing alpha7 nicotinic receptors tended to be smaller in size than those lacking alpha7 receptors. Bath application of muscarine induced two response patterns: mIN only (17/38) and mIN+ mOUT (21/38). The mIN and mOUT were mediated by M3 (plus M1) and M2 muscarinic receptors, respectively. These results suggest that a major response to cholinergic inputs to cTRNs is excitatory.

3820,"Dose-responses from multi-model inference for the non-cancer disease mortality of atomic bomb survivors The non-cancer mortality data for cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular diseases from Report 13 on the atomic bomb survivors published by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation were analysed to investigate the dose-response for the influence of radiation on these detrimental health effects. Various parametric and categorical models (such as linear-no-threshold (LNT) and a number of threshold and step models) were analysed with a statistical selection protocol that rated the model description of the data. Instead of applying the usual approach of identifying one preferred model for each data set, a set of plausible models was applied, and a sub-set of non-nested models was identified that all fitted the data about equally well. Subsequently, this sub-set of non-nested models was used to perform multi-model inference (MMI), an innovative method of mathematically combining different models to allow risk estimates to be based on several plausible dose-response models rather than just relying on a single model of choice. This procedure thereby produces more reliable risk estimates based on a more comprehensive appraisal of model uncertainties. For CVD, MMI yielded a weak dose-response (with a risk estimate of about one-third of the LNT model) below a step at 0.6 Gy and a stronger dose-response at higher doses. The calculated risk estimates are consistent with zero risk below this threshold-dose. For mortalities related to cardiovascular diseases, an LNT-type dose-response was found with risk estimates consistent with zero risk below 2.2 Gy based on 90% confidence intervals. The MMI approach described here resolves a dilemma in practical radiation protection when one is forced to select between models with profoundly different dose-responses for risk estimates.",Included

Approximately 1 million events are acquired in 15 minutes, starting 1 hour after injection of 10 mCi (370 MBq) of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose. Normal structures as small as the superior colliculi and the external capsule have been resolved. Improved separation of the cortical ribbon from adjacent white matter has allowed more accurate determination of cortical metabolic rate. In two of 15 patients undergoing evaluation for recurrent glioma, the PET 600 images showed tumor uptake that was not apparent on a lower-resolution study. A high-activity orbiting transmission source with electronic collimation allows accurate, short-duration transmission measurements to be made after radiopharmaceutical administration. The anatomic detail seen on the transmission images can be used for reproducible patient positioning with an accuracy of 1-2 mm perpendicular to the image plane. These findings demonstrate the practicality and clinical effectiveness of high-resolution positron emission tomography.",Excluded
3838,"Missense mutations but not allelic variants alter the function of ATM by dominant interference in patients with breast cancer The human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is characterized by hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and an elevated risk of malignancy. Epidemiological data support an increased risk for breast and other cancers in A-T heterozygotes. However, screening breast cancer cases for truncating mutations in the ATM (A-T mutated) gene has failed largely to reveal an increased incidence in these patients. It has been hypothesized that ATM missense mutations are implicated in breast cancer, and there is some evidence to support this. The presence of a large variety of rare missense variants in addition to common polymorphisms in ATM makes it difficult to establish such a relationship by association studies. To investigate the functional significance of these changes we have introduced missense substitutions, identified in either A-T or breast cancer patients, into ATM cDNA before establishing stable cell lines to determine their effect on ATM function. Pathogenic missense mutations and neutral missense variants were distinguished initially by their capacity to correct the radiosensitive phenotype in A-T cells. Furthermore missense mutations abolished the radiation-induced kinase activity of ATM in normal control cells, caused chromosome instability, and reduced cell viability in irradiated control cells, whereas neutral variants failed to do so. Mutant ATM was expressed at the same level as endogenous protein, and interference with normal ATM function seemed to be by multimerization. This approach represents a means of identifying genuine ATM mutations and addressing the significance of missense changes in the ATM gene in a variety of cancers including breast cancer.",Excluded

3769,"Emerging treatments and gene expression profiling in high-risk medulloblastoma The past decades have seen an increase in the survival rates of patients with standard-risk medulloblastoma. Efforts have, therefore, been focused on obtaining better results in the treatment of patients with high-risk tumors. In addition to consolidated therapies, novel approaches such as small molecules, monoclonal antibodies, and antiangiogenic therapies that aim to improve outcomes and quality of life are now available through new breakthroughs in the molecular biology of medulloblastoma. The advent of innovative anticancer drugs tested in brain tumors has important consequences for personalized therapy. Gene expression profiling of medulloblastoma can be used to identify the genes and signaling transduction pathways that are crucial for the tumorigenesis process, thereby revealing both new targets for therapy and sensitive/resistance phenotypes. The interpretation of microarray data for new treatments of patients with high-risk medulloblastoma, as well as other poor prognosis tumors, should be developed through a consensus multidisciplinary approach involving oncologists, neurosurgeons, radiotherapists, biotechnologists, bioinformaticists, and other professionals.

3865,"Benefits of Early Palliative Care in the Community: A Propensity Score Matched Cancer Cohort Objective: Randomized trials of early palliative care (PC) showed patient benefits. However these benefits have not been validated in community-based cohorts. The objective is to assess the impact of early vs not-early PC among cancer decedents on the risk of receiving aggressive care (ED/hospitalization), supportive care (home care/physician home visit), or hospital death. Method(s): We took a retrospective cohort of Ontario decedents between 2004 and 2014. We identified those who were 'early' PC users (i.e. used a validated PC service between month 12-6 before death [exposure]). We used propensity score matching to identify a control group of 'not-early' PC users. We hard matched on age, sex, cancer type and stage. The propensity score included region, income, year, radiation, etc. Among those with InterRAI assessments in exposure period, we additionally controlled for health instability, and dependency, depression, cognitive performance, pain, and caregiver presence via propensity score. McNemar test used to examine differences between pairs. Result(s): 51,001 decedents received early PC vs 85,979 not-early PC (i.e. late or none). After matching among those with no interRAI assessments, we found 34,184 pairs of early and not-early PC users. Both groups had equal distributions of age, sex, cancer type (e.g. 25% lung cancer) and stage (e.g. 24% stage 3 or 4). Compared to not-early PC users, early PC users had a 10% lower absolute risk to die in hospital and have any aggressive care respectively and a 24% higher absolute risk to any receive supportive care. In a mutually exclusive cohort, matching among those with interRAI assessments, we identified 3,419 pairs of early and not-early PC users. Both groups had equal scores in health instability (e.g. 12% moderate-high CHESS score) and other interRAI scales. The outcome results were similar to the non-interRAI analysis. Conclusion(s): Using propensity score matching, decedents receiving early PC are likely to receive more supportive care and less aggressive care compared to not-early PC users. Our study uniquely focuses on a population receiving community palliative care. In a distinct sample using interRAI assessments, we control for several confounders previously unmeasured.

4452,"Evidence that tRNA synthetase-directed proton transfer stops mistranslation To prevent mistranslation, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) discriminate against noncognate amino acids and cellular metabolites. Defects in specificity produce statistical proteins which, in mammalian cells, lead to activation of the unfolded protein response and cell death. Because of inherent limitations in amino acid discrimination by a single active site, AARSs evolved a separate domain to clear mischarged amino acids. Although the structure of a widely distributed editing domain for ThrRS and AlaRS is known, the mechanism of amino acid clearance remains elusive. This domain has two motifs that together have four conserved residues in the pocket used to clear serine from mischarged tRNAs. Here, using ThrRS as an example, rapid single-turnover kinetics, mutagenesis, and solvent isotope analysis show that a strictly conserved histidine (between ThrRS and AlaRS) extracts a proton in the chemical step of the editing reaction. Three other conserved residues, and two additional residues in the editing pocket, are not directly implicated in the chemical step. These results are relevant to the previously reported mutagenesis of the homologous editing pocket of alanyl-tRNA synthetase, where even a mild defect in editing causes neurodegeneration in the mouse. Thus, a single proton-transfer event needed to prevent mistranslation can have profound implications for disease.",Excluded

4559,"c-Abl is required for development and optimal cell proliferation in the context of p53 deficiency The c-Abl tyrosine kinase and the p53 tumor suppressor protein interact functionally and biochemically in cellular genotoxic stress response pathways and are implicated as downstream mediators of ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated). This fact led us to study genetic interactions in vivo between c-Abl and p53 by examining the phenotype of mice and cells deficient in both proteins. c-Abl-null mice show high neonatal mortality and decreased B lymphocytes, whereas p53-null mice are prone to tumor development. Surprisingly, mice doubly deficient in both c-Abl and p53 are not viable, suggesting that c-Abl and p53 together contribute to an essential function required for normal development. Fibroblasts lacking both c-Abl and p53 were similar to fibroblasts deficient in p53 alone, showing loss of the G(1)/S cell-cycle checkpoint and similar clonogenic survival after ionizing radiation. Fibroblasts deficient in both c-Abl and p53 show reduced growth in culture, as manifested by reduction in the rate of proliferation, saturation density, and colony formation, compared with fibroblasts lacking p53 alone. This defect could be restored by reconstitution of c-Abl expression. Taken together, these results indicate that the ATM phenotype cannot be explained solely by loss of c-Abl and p53 and that c-Abl contributes to enhanced proliferation of p53-deficient cells. Inhibition of c-Abl function may be a therapeutic strategy to target p53-deficient cells selectively.",Excluded

Mice were hemibrain-irradiated with 5 fractions of 2 Gy and sacrificed 8 weeks after the end of treatment. Abeta and tau were assessed using immunohistochemistry and quantified using image analysis with Definiens Tissue Studio. We observed a significant reduction in Abeta plaque burden and tau staining; these two parameters were significantly correlated.

Material(s) and Method(s): Phytotherapy was introduced after the tumour had progressed. It consisted of 4 types of herbal medicine which the subject was taking in form of tea once a day at regular intervals. The patient started phytotherapy along with temozolomide, which was the only oncological treatment she was under after the tumour had progressed. Following the finished chemotherapy, the patient continued the treatment with herbal medicine only. She regularly took phytotherapy without interruption and to the fullest extent for 30 months, and the results of treatment were monitored by periodic scanning using nuclear magnetic resonance technique. Result(s): The control scanning that was conducted after the end of combined treatment with temozolomide and phytotherapy showed tumour regression. The patient continued with phytotherapy after finishing chemotherapy and, during the following 24 months, it was the sole treatment option. In that period, the regression of the tumour continued, until a control examination 30 months after the introduction of phytotherapy showed no clinical and radiological signs of tumour. Conclusion(s): The results presented in this research paper clearly indicate the potential of phytotherapy in the treatment of some types of brain tumours. A complete regression of tumour following the treatment with nothing but herbal medicine offers support for such claim. Future research should demonstrate the effectiveness of phytotherapy, as a supplementary form of brain tumour treatment, and the results of this research should be compared with the existing information on the effectiveness of the protocols currently used in the treatment of these types of tumour.

3745,"Identification of the S3 foramen during transforaminal sacral neuromodulation lead placement-a novel ""rolling pen"" technique INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is FDA approved for urinary urgency, urinary frequency, urgency urinary incontinence, non-obstructive urinary retention and fecal incontinence. SNM modulates electrical input to the bladder preventing and decreasing over stimulation, thus improving symptoms. The S3 foramen must be localized for lead implantation and the efficacy of implantation depends on the ability to localize S3 reliably and correctly. Localization is accomplished using various strategies, most commonly using a combination of palpation of bony landmarks and fluoroscopy. This paper will serve to introduce a novel ""rolling pen"" technique that eliminates the use of fluoroscopy for S3 identification. This technique is currently used in clinical practice by the two highest volume implanters in Louisiana. METHOD(S): The patients were positioned prone and prepped in the usual manner. Instead of using fluoroscopy or palpation to identify bony landmarks to localize the S3 foramen, we balanced a marking pen longitudinally in the midline of the sacrum. The pen was allowed to roll until horizontal equilibrium was established. The fulcrum of the balanced ""rolling pen"" identified the level of S3. A mark 2 cm proximal and 2 cm lateral to this landmark was made for entry of the finder needle at the level of the skin. We then proceeded with our implantation in the usual manner. The rolling pen technique was used for all patients as our initial strategy to identify the S3 foramen. RESULT(S): 228 implantations were performed between 7/2012 and 10/2014 at our 2 tertiary centers. All cases used the rolling pen technique as our initial S3 foramen identification strategy. Adhering to the ALARA principle, fluoroscopy was limited to confirming and adjusting needle and lead placement in the operating room. All office procedures were performed without fluoroscopy. CONCLUSION(S): We conclude that the novel rolling pen technique can be used as yet another method for S3 localization during transforaminal lead placement during SNM implantation.

4330,"Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy as a boost treatment for tumors in the head and neck region The objective of this retrospective study was to report initial results of CyberKnife stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) boost for tumors in the head and neck area. Between March 2008 and August 2009, 10 patients were treated with SRT boost using CyberKnife system due mainly to unfavorable condition such as tumors in close proximity to serial organs or former radiotherapy fields. Treatment sites were the external auditory canal in two, the nasopharynx in one, the oropharynx in three, the nasal cavity in one, the maxillary sinus in two, and the oligometastatic cervical lymph node in one. All patients underwent preceding conventional radiotherapy of 40 to 60 Gy. Dose and fractionation scheme of the Cyberknife SRT boost was individualized, and prescribed dose ranged from 9 Gy to 16 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions. Among four patients for whom dose to the optic pathway was concerned, the maximum dose was only about 3 Gy for three patients whereas 9.6 Gy in the remaining one patient. The maximum dose for the mandible in one of three patients with oropharyngeal cancer was 19.7 Gy, whereas majority of the bone can be spared by using non-isocentric conformal beams. For a patient with nasopharyngeal cancer, the highest dose in the brain stem was 15 Gy. However, majority of the brain stem received less than 40% of the maximum dose. Although a small volume high dose area within the normal structure could be observed in several patients, results of the present study showed potential benefits of the CyberKnife SRT boost.",Excluded
4535,"Event-triggered neuroadaptive control for postcapture spacecraft with ultralow-frequency actuator updates This paper investigates an event-triggered neuroadaptive control approach for postcapture flexible spacecraft with guaranteed prespecified tracking performance in the presence of unknown inertial properties, actuator constraints, and external space perturbations. By employing the minimum-learning parameter technique into the neural proportional integral-like controller, only two adaptive parameters are required to update online, which completely avoids the tedious inertial parameter identifications and dramatically reduces the complexity of controller in the meanwhile. Compared with existing works, the primary advantage of the proposed attitude control approach is that the actuator updates are determined by the prescribed event-based conditions in an aperiodic way rather than a periodic one, which greatly reduces the actuator updates. Finally, two groups of illustrative examples are organized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of attitude stabilization and tracking for the postcapture flexible spacecraft.

3664,"A reappraisal of the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited small cell lung cancer The use of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited stage small cell lung cancer remains controversial. Prospective trials have demonstrated that PCI can reduce central nervous system relapse rates, but the impact on survival remains questionable except for the possible evidence of a beneficial effect for long term survivors. With higher rates of thoracic control now obtainable with hyperfractionated radiation and concomitant chemotherapy, it becomes important to analyze the benefit of PCI in that setting. Before 1982, we included PCI in the management of all patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer; thereafter, we discontinued its use. This report compares the outcome of the two treatment approaches and addresses the role of PCI among patients who achieve durable local control. There were 36 limited stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with PCI from 1979-1982 and 26 patients treated without PCI from 1985-1989. Induction chemotherapy was followed in both groups by thoracic irradiation (45 Gy). The PCI patients received 30 Gy to the whole brain in 10 fractions. Both groups received maintenance chemotherapy. Of complete responders, brain failure was the first failure in 18% (4/22) of PCI (+) versus 45% (10/22) of PCI (-) (p = .04). Survival at 2 years was 42% for PCI (+) versus 13% for PCI (-) (p less than .05). When the analysis was limited to those patients permanently controlled in the thorax; there were 25% (4/16) brain failures PCI (+) versus 70% (7/10) PCI (-) (p = .03). For this same subset the 2-year survival was 56% PCI (+) versus 14% PCI (-) (p less than .05). There were no 5 year survivors without PCI compared to 38% (6/16) with PCI. These data suggest that PCI appears to be effective in enhancing survival of patients who achieve durable thoracic control. Prospective trials are necessary to evaluate the use of PCI combined with therapeutic regimens with a documented ability to achieve high rates of sustained control of thoracic disease.",Excluded

Several large cohort studies of 80-198 patients have reported complication rates of 2.5% to 9% using particles or n-butyl cyanoacrylate (nBCA).[1-5] However, although a recent national registry of 898 patients found an association between liquid embolysate and complication rates, with an odds ratio of 3.9.[6] Endovascular technology continues to evolve and ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH or Onyx Medtronic) has been available for embolization of arteriovenous malformations for over a decade. The off-label use of EVOH for pre-operative embolization of meningiomas or hemangiopericytomas has only been reported in small series. This study reviewed the safety profile and embolization duration of our experience with EVOH embolization. Methods Review of institutional records identified 72 consecutive cases of meningiomas and hemangiopericytomas that underwent pre-operative embolization with EVOH prior to surgical resection from 2007 to 2017. The imaging and medical records were reviewed to identify tumor dimensions, vascular pedicles, endovascular equipment, outcomes and complications. Embolization rate was compared with Wilcox signed-rank test and complication rates were compared using the Fisher exact test. Results The tumors measured 5 cm (IQR 4.4-6.3) or 45 cm<sup>3</sup> (23-71) and were located on the convexity (26%), tentorium (22%), falx (20%), sphenoid ridge (15%), petrous (5%), anterior cranial fossa (5%), infratemporal fossa (4%), and middle cranial fossa (3%). The most frequent pedicle embolized was a middle meningeal artery. In 83% of cases, this was the first pedicle embolized and in 24% of cases, an additional MMA catheterization was used for embolization. Additional pedicles included the internal maxillary (8), occipital artery (7), superficial temporal (4), posterior meningeal (2), posterior auricular (1), and ascending pharyngeal (1) arteries. Tumor supply from branches of the internal carotid artery were typically not embolized: anterior cerebral branches (3 embolized: 7 not embolized), middle cerebral branches (0:11), ophthalmic branches (0:11). In 7 cases, nBCA was also used, most commonly in the superior cerebellar artery (3:7). Abstract O-033 Table 1 Tumor embolization characteristics VIEW INLINE VIEW POPUP There were symptomatic complications from embolization in 8% of cases. Twice, tumor necrosis and edema required earlier craniotomy and tumor evacuation, and four patients had new neurologic deficit from infarct. Two occurred from reflux and two occurred from embolysate migration across the tumor to pial vessels. The complication rate was not different from studies in meningiomas with 75 or more cases using other embolysates (p-value 0.15-1.0). In power analysis, comparison against previously published studies would distinguish a complication rate of 23% in a series of this size. Conclusion Embolization with EVOH is comparable in safety to other embolization techniques in meningioma or hemangiopericytoma. Similar to what has been described in arteriovenous malformations, simultaneous dual catheter embolization may decrease procedural time and radiation exposure.",Excluded
4690,"Dose-dependent effects of small-vessel disease MRI markers on regional cortical thinning and structural connectivity Background: MRI markers of cerebral small vessel disease including white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, and microbleeds are related to cognitive dysfunction in subjects with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Previous studies have usually focused on the location of these vascular markers and did not consider the concomitant effect by Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. In this study, we aimed to find dose-dependent effects of these MRI markers on regional cortical thinning and white matter tract damage in VCI patients, considering the effect by concomitant AD pathology. Method(s): Participants consisted of 65 patients with mild cognitive impairment associated with small-vessel disease (svMCI) and 69 with subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD). Conventional brain MRI scans, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and PIB PET were performed. WMH, lacunes, microbleeds, and PIB retention amount were measured. Multiple regression analyses were used to elucidate the relationship between regional cortical thickness, DTI abnormalities, and each small vessel vascular marker, adjusting the effects by demographic factors and PIB retention amount. Result(s): Higher WMH volume was associated with cortical thinning in bilateral cingulate cortices, right insular cortex, and left lingual gyrus. More lacunes were associated with cortical thinning in the right medial and superior frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. Microbleeds were not related with regional cortical thinning. Higher PIB retention was associated with cortical thinning in left medial temporal lobe. Independent of other vascular markers and PIB retention amount, larger WMH volume was associated with decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in widespread periventricular white matter region. Regardless of PIB retention amount, more lacunes were associated with decreased FA in bilateral posterior and anterior corona radiata, right anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral posterior limb of internal capsule, and bilateral precuneus. Microbleeds had association with decreased FA in the bilateral posterior corona radiata and optic radiation. PIB retention amount was not related with regional FA decrease. The association between neuropsychological scores and vascularmarkers were generally compatible with findings from cortical thickness and DTI analyses. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that small vessel vascular markers in VCI patients are related with regional cortical thinning and white matter abnormalities in a dosedependent manner regardless of AD pathology.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of three different methods of neurologically intact TLF treatment: OPSF, minimally invasive two-plane conventional fluoroscopy-guided (FPPSF) and navigation-guided (N-PPSF). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 137 patients underwent either OPSF (n = 50) or F-PPSF (n = 39) or N-PPSF (n = 48) for stabilization of TLF between 2014 and 2016 in two Departments (Orthopaedics and Neurosurgery). Radiographs were obtained before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the final follow-up for assessment of the restoration of the spinal column. For radiologic parameters, Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle, and vertebral body compression ratio were evaluated on lateral thoracolumbar radiographs. As a method of clinical evaluation, the intraoperative blood loss, operation time, radiation dose, postoperative hospital stay, the postoperative scar size and perioprative complications. Result(s): There were significant differences between open and both percutaneous methods of treatment in surgical blood loss and postoperative hospital stay in favour of percutaneous and without significant difference between F-PPSF and N-PPSF. The time of the surgery was the shortest in OPSF and F-PPSF. The radiation dose was both the highest for the patient and the lowest for the operative team in N-PPSF. The length of the postoperative scar was equal for all groups. There were five infections of the operative wound and one implant loosening in OPSF group without any significant complication. Postoperative VAS decreased significantly in all groups and there was a significant difference in favour of percutaneous techniques groups at the time of discharge and after 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months postoperatively. There were no statistical differences in VAS. For both F-PPSF and N-PPSF ODI was significantly better 6 weeks after the surgery than for OPSF without any difference between all groups at the final follow-up. The regional sagittal Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle and anterior height of the fractured vertebra all significantly improved in each group immediately after the surgery and at the final follow-up. Conclusion(s): Both percutaneous pedicle screw fixation techniques were comparable except the radiation dose for the operative team, which was the lowest in N-PPSF group. Although all three groups showed favorable outcomes at the final follow-up, F-PPSF and N-PPSF provided earlier pain relief, better functional improvement, less perioperative complications but worse early postoperative radiological outcome in comparison with OPSF.",Excluded

Indian soldiers are deployed in these varied environmental conditions and are subject to the detrimental effects of these extreme environmental excesses. In addition, the noise and radiation exposure of the troops is a significant occupational hazard. The troops of the Indian Defence Forces are not only expected to survive these extremes but also to perform physically and mentally to discharge their military duties effectively. DIPAS has been working in the field of military physiology for past fifty years with the primary mandate of promoting human performance in extreme environments. Neurophysiological mechanisms of anorexia, High Altitude Pulmonary Edema, cold injuries, memory impairment, sleep pattern at high altitude have been elucidated for developing preventive/therapeutic measures. We have undertaken various approaches to devise strategies and productsto improve performance of soldiers to combat physiological stresses posed by harsh environments. o Cold, hypoxic environment of High Altitude: For treating patients of AMS and HAPE and for persons visiting high altitude for shorter duration, a system for improving oxygenation is developed in the form of hyperoxic shelters. Nitric Oxide Delivery System for treatment of HAPE has also been optimized along with formulating Aloe Vera based Alocal cream to treat/prevent cold injuries. Acclimatization schedule and tenure of posting to aid in the rapid acclimatization of soldiers to high altitude has been prepared.

Improved Space Heating Devices (Bukhari) have been designed that uses nearly half fuel and does not build CO in the room where it is used, thus making it safe and cost effective. We have tailored Yoga packages for the Armed forces for their performance improvement. o Hot and dry/humid climate of Deserts/Coastal regions/Dense Tropical Jungles: Hypohydration and the resultant loss of water and electrolytes from the body are the major threats to human physiology in these environments. Soldiers need to acclimatize to the heat in order to survive in these border areas. DIPAS has designed Vortex cooling systems for desert operations to combat heat stress. Tanks provide a heated microclimate for the soldier operating in it, to provide comfort to the tank crew operating in extreme hot conditions, we made a solid state cooling garment for the tank crew. o Occupational stress environment: Soldiers are constantly exposed to high intensity noise of firing, aircrafts, tanks, etc and it is imperative to reduce the noise induced hearing loss to safeguard them.

4651,"The possible neurobehavioral protective effects of natural antioxidant against phototoxicity attenuation of antimicrobial quinolone group in rats The fluoroquinolones absorb light in the 320 to 330 nm ultraviolet A (UV-A) wavelength and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide; thus, the photodynamic generation of ROS may be the basis of phototoxicity of quinolones in human beings and animals. This study aimed to evaluate the damaging effects of UV-A radiation at different periods of exposure on rats' brains administered with ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin administration in UV-A exposed animals exaggerated the brain-oxidative stress biomarkers and decreased the locomotor activity. Exposure of rats to UV-A for 60 minutes induced a significant increase of malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and a decrease in the values of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) compared to a normal one; these changes were UV-A exposure time-dependent. However, the administration of vitamin C to the UV-60-treated group decreased the values of MDA, MPO, and shifted the values of SOD, GSH toward the normal values. Vitamin C, probably due to its strong antioxidant properties, could improve and partially counteract the toxic effect of UV-A on oxidative stress parameters and prevent the damage in rat's brain tissues.",Excluded

However, the role of BUB1 in glioblastoma remains poorly investigated. In this study, clinical analyses determined significant enrichment of BUB1 in glioblastoma with direct correlation of elevated expression to poorer prognosis in glioma patients. Genetic inhibition of BUB1 in glioblastoma tumor cells via shRNA silencing diminished both proliferative ability and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of BUB1 was additionally determined to promote the cytotoxic effect of irradiation on glioblastoma tumor cells, and investigation of the underlying pathways revealed the roles of DNA mismatch repair, spliceosome and c-Myc pathways. Mechanistically, FOXM1 was determined to positively regulate transcription of BUB1 via direct promoter region binding. For validation, pharmacologic inhibition through administration of a BUB1 inhibitor demonstrated attenuated glioblastoma cellular proliferation in vitro as well as delayed tumor growth with prolonged survival in vivo. Collectively, this study demonstrates a novel therapeutic target for glioblastoma in the form of BUB1, which plays a pivotal role in GBM proliferative and radio-resistance capacities in a FOXM1-dependant manner.",Excluded
4368,"Hyperbaric oxygen treatment of osteoradionecrosis of the mandible with repeated pathologic fracture. Report of a case Treatment of patients with osteoradionecrosis of the mandible with a pathologic fracture consists in almost all cases of a continuity resection of the mandible. This leads to functional and esthetic problems that can only be solved by often extensive surgery. In this case report we present a 38-year-old woman who developed osteoradionecrosis of the mandible with a pathologic fracture 1 1/2 years after combined surgical and radiation therapy of an adenocarcinoma of the right parotid gland. The patient had a subcondylar pathologic fracture together with osteolysis in the right mandibular body, normally an indication for partial resection of the mandible. Because of the absence of denuded bone, fistulation, and the poor quality of the surrounding soft tissues, a more conservative approach was chosen. Treatment consisted of hyperbaric oxygen and dental extractions with alveolectomy with the patient under local anesthesia. During follow-up, a second pathologic fracture occurred in the region of the right first and second molar. No additional treatment was given. Six and one-half years after the initial treatment and 5 1/2 years after the last fracture, the patient is free of complaints, the fractures have healed and both esthetic and functional results are good.",Excluded

The dose range of X-irradiation was from 1,300 to 2,500 rads, i.e., 1,300, 1,500, 1,750, 2,000, and 2,500 rads. Eighty-six mice were used for histological examination. For microscopic examination, the mice were killed at regular postirradiation intervals between 15 and 20, 31 and 40, 41 and 50, 51 and 60, 61 and 70, 71 and 80, 81 and 90, 139 and 177 weeks. The brains were removed immediately thereafter, fixed in Bouin's solution, and embedded in paraffin. A histological examination was performed by a morphometric estimation of vascular lesions, in which the degree of the damage to the arterial system was scored in whole serial brain sections. Necrosis (encephalomalacia), atrophy, cell infiltration, and telangiectatic vascular change of the brain, caused as a result of the fibrinoid necrosis of the large arteries, were observed. Dose-dependent incidence of the fibrinoid necrosis increased between 41 and 87 weeks after irradiation. Mean score of fibrinoid necrosis increased dose dependently approximately 60 weeks after irradiation. It is suggested that scores of large vessel damage do relate to dose at 41 to 87 weeks, and can be used to quantify the vessel injury, and that fibrinoid necrosis of the large vessels may relate to the incidence of radionecrosis.",Included

Vibratome sections of perfusion-fixed rat brain were incubated: (a) overnight at room temperature (20-22 degrees C), (b) during various periods of time under microwave irradiation, such that the induced temperatures did not exceed 10 degrees C, (c) same as (b) but with induced temperatures not exceeding 40 degrees C, (d) without microwave irradiation, at 4-10 degrees C (temperature control for (b)), (e) same as (d) but at 40 degrees C (temperature control for (c)). During the incubation-irradiation we continuously monitored the temperature and controlled it by cooling and by manipulating the energy output of the magnetron. The peroxidase immunocytochemical procedure was completed using for all sections the same incubation parameters. Selected GABA-immunoreacted sections were examined in the electron microscope. Incubation at 10 degrees C in the primary antiserum as short as 30 min, with or without microwave irradiation, already results in (weak) binding of the antibodies to immunoreactive structures. One or 2 h of incubation in the primary antiserum in the microwave oven at 40 degrees C or at the same temperature outside the microwave oven results in excellent staining of GABA-immunoreactive structures and of good staining of enkephalin- or vasopressin-immunoreactive structures. The ultrastructural details were much better preserved in incubated-irradiated sections than in sections incubated overnight and only slightly less preserved than in the other control sections. There is no improved penetration of the antibodies into the sections. We conclude that by using microwave technology or by raising the temperature of the incubation medium, the time of incubation, at least in these antisera, can be shortened drastically, whereas the ultrastructural details remain well preserved.",Excluded
4485,"Radiation-induced changes in nucleoid halo diameters of aerobic and hypoxic SF-126 human brain tumor cells Nucleoid halo diameters were measured to assay changes in DNA supercoiling in human brain tumor cell line SF-126 after irradiation under aerobic or hypoxic conditions. In unirradiated aerobic cells, a typical propidium iodide titration curve showed that with increasing concentrations of propidium iodide, the halo diameter increased and then decreased with the unwinding and subsequent rewinding of DNA supercoils. In irradiated cells, the rewinding of DNA supercoils was inhibited, resulting in an increased halo diameter, in a radiation dose-dependent manner. To produce equal increases in halo diameter required about a threefold higher radiation dose in hypoxic cells than in aerobic cells. Quantitatively similar differences in the radiation sensitivities of hypoxic and aerobic cells were demonstrated by a colony-forming efficiency assay. These findings suggest that the nucleoid halo assay may be used as a rapid measure of the inherent radiation sensitivity of human tumors.",Excluded
4633,"Technical and dosimetric considerations in multi-isocenter intensity modulated radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma with small multileaf collimator Multileaf collimator (MLC)-assisted intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has greatly improved the target coverage and avoidance of organs at risk (OAR) for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma; however, its implementation is also constrained by the features of the MLC. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma tends to have a large gross target volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV) due to its biological characteristics. More than one isocenter may be needed when small MLCs (i.e., BrainLAB M3, whose largest field is 10 x 10 cm(2)) are used to treat the nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The BrainLAB IMRT system was used to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-isocenter IMRT plan for treating nasopharyngeal cancers. Dose coverage of GTVs and CTVs were compared among IMRT plans with 1, 2 and 3 isocenters, as were dose objectives for OARs including brainstem, cord, and parotids. The dosimetric variation and the delivery time were also measured with a phantom. IMRT plans with more than 1 isocenter achieved a better dose coverage, homogeneity, and conformity on GTVs and CTVs; however, with risk of higher doses given to OARs. In most cases, one can generate satisfactory IMRT plans using the 2-isocenter IMRT planning strategy. Two-isocenter planning strategy may be a suitable compromise when more isocenters are needed.",Excluded
4747,"A rodent in situ glioma allograft model to study bone marrow-derived cell migration Radiotherapy (RT) induced hypoxia recruits bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) to tumors through the upregulation of Stromal Derived Factor-1, a chemokine that binds to receptor CXCR4 present on BMDCs. The infiltration of BMDCs, which includes endothelial progenitors, pericyte progenitors, tumor-associated macrophages, immature monocytes, VEGFR<sup>+</sup> hemangiocytes, and CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells has been implicated in supporting tumor establishment by contributing to tumor growth, angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, inflammation, and immune suppression. In this work, we have used a rodent glioma in situ allograft model to study the recruitment/migration of BMDCs post RT. Female albino C57 (8-10 weeks old, Jackson Laboratories) animals underwent +DsRed bone marrow transplant (B6.Cg-Tg(CAG-DsRed*MST)1Nagy/J donor mouse). Following engraftment, glioma cells were cranially implanted with 1x10 glioma cells (GL261-Luc, Perkin Elmer), at an average size of 26.4mm indicated by a bioluminescence signal of 5.28x10 photons/sec/cm/sr, animals underwent 6Gy (RadSource 2000, 250kVp, 25mA) of irradiation limited to a 1cm wide slit centered on the tumor. Bioluminescence (tumor size) and fluorescence imaging (+DsRed BMDCs) was performed prior to and at 1-and 2-weeks post-RT to assess tumor growth and measure the influx of +DsRed BMDCs. In addition, flow cytometry was used to measure the number of +DsRed BMDCs in the tumor and brain. To study the effect of BMDCs in tumor regression, tumors were irradiated at a smaller size (9.3mm) with 10Gy irradiation. At 1-week post-RT, flow cytometry was used to measure the number of BMDCs (CD45+) in the tumor. In our model 6Gy radiation was able to stall the growth of the tumor. Irradiated tumors did not significantly change in tumor size at either 1-or 2-weeks post irradiation compared to pre-RT size. In addition, irradiated tumors were significantly smaller than untreated tumors (p=0.0008) 1-week post-RT. Using flow cytometry 1-week post irradiation, we observed a significant increase in the number of +DsRed BMDCs in the irradiated tumor (23.5% of cells +DsRed BMDCs) compared to the irradiated brain (6.17% cells +DsRed BMDCs, p=0.03) as well as a significant increase in the tumors (16.6% cells +DsRed BMDCs) compared to the brain (11.1% cells +DsRed BMDCs p=0.02). There was no difference in the number of +DsRed BMDCS in tumors +/- irradiation or brains +/- irradiation. We found similar results in our tumor regression model using flow cytometry 1-week post-RT; we observed an increase in the number of BMDCs CD45+ in the tumor (~20% of cells CD45+) compared to control tumors (~6% of cells CD45+). Indicating that tumor size at the onset of RT did not effect the migration of BMDCs. Fluorescence imaging did not measure any significant change in the DsRed signal at 1-or 2-weeks post-irradiation. We have successfully shown that post-RT there is an increase in BMDCs migration at 1-week post RT regardless of tumor size at RT. Further experimentation is needed to better elucidate the role of BMDCs in tumor inflammation and immune suppression as well as angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Our next step is to perform immunohistochemistry on our collected tumor tissue to map out the spatial location of migrated BMDCs within the tumor.",Excluded
3998,"Light delays synaptic deafferentation and potentiates the survival of axotomized retinal ganglion cells Knowledge of the cellular mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of stimulation and the optimal doses of such stimulation to maximize neuronal recovery is essential to guide clinical practice in neural rehabilitation.

Here we show that: (a) in addition to cell death, a population of cells undergoes synaptic deafferentation and (b) light stimulation delays cell death and deafferentation. Among the three rearing conditions studied (6:18LD, 12:12LD, and 18:6LD), the 12:12LD condition appears to be the one achieving the optimal therapeutic effect.

Noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy plans consisted of 4 noncoplanar arcs and 2 full coplanar arcs, respectively. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy plans consisted of 7 coplanar fields. CyberKnife plans used skull tracking to ensure accurate position. All plans were generated to cover 95% target volume with prescription dose. Gradient index, conformity index, normal brain tissue volume (V <sub>3Gy</sub> - V <sub>24Gy</sub>), monitor units, and beam on time were evaluated.RESULTS: Gradient index was the lowest for CyberKnife (3.49 +/- 0.65), followed by noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (4.21 +/- 1.38), coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (4.87 +/- 1.35), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (5.36 +/- 1.98). Conformity index was the largest for noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (0.87 +/- 0.03), followed by coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (0.86 +/- 0.04), CyberKnife (0.86 +/- 0.07), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (0.85 +/- 0.05). Normal brain tissue volume at high-to-moderate dose spreads (V <sub>24Gy</sub> - V <sub>9Gy</sub>) was significantly reduced in noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy over that of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy. Normal brain tissue volume for noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy was comparable with noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy at high-dose level (V <sub>24Gy</sub> - V <sub>15Gy</sub>) and larger than CyberKnife at moderate-to-low dose level (V <sub>12Gy</sub> - V <sub>3Gy</sub>). Monitor units was highest for CyberKnife (28 733.59 +/- 7197.85), followed by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (4128.40 +/- 1185.38), noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (3105.20 +/- 371.23), and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (2997.27 +/- 446.84). Beam on time was longest for CyberKnife (30.25 +/- 7.32 minutes), followed by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (2.95 +/- 0.85 minutes), noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (2.61 +/- 0.07 minutes), and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (2.30 +/- 0.23 minutes).CONCLUSION: For brain metastases far away from organs-at-risk, noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy generated more rapid dose falloff and higher conformity compared to intensity-modulated radiation therapy and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy. Noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy provided a comparable dose falloff with CyberKnife at high-dose level and a slower dose falloff than CyberKnife at moderate-to-low dose level. Noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy plans had less monitor units and shorter beam on time than CyberKnife plans.",Excluded

3620,"Anxiety and cognition in histamine H3 receptor-/- mice Histamine H(3) receptors (H3Rs) were first characterized as autoreceptors modulating histamine release and synthesis via negative feedback. Acute H3R stimulation or blockade with selective agonists and antagonists suggests a role for H3R in anxiety and cognition. However, little is known about the long-term effects of H3R blockade on brain function. In the current study, mice lacking H3 receptors (H3R(-/-)) were used to investigate the role of H3R-mediated signalling in anxiety and cognition. H3R(-/-) mice showed enhanced spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze. In addition, H3R(-/-) mice showed reduced measures of anxiety in the elevated plus and zero mazes involving exploratory behaviour and avoidable anxiety-provoking stimuli, but enhanced acoustic startle responses involving unavoidable anxiety-provoking stimuli. These behavioural alterations were associated with higher arginine vasopressin levels in the central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala. These findings support a role for H3Rs in mediating histamine effects on spatial learning and memory and measures of anxiety.",Excluded

4799,Irradiated normal brain promotes invasion of glioblastoma through vascular endothelial growth and stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha The significance of irradiated normal brain volume in glioma recurrence is usually ignored by radiotherapists. The whole-brain irradiation (WBI) of 15 Gy in three fractions was delivered to C57BL/6 mice before implantation of GL261 glioma cells. The changes in vascular endothelial growth (VEGF) and stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) after WBI were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Cell invasion assays were performed to study the effects of VEGF and SDF-1alpha. The levels of VEGF and SDF-1alpha in normal brain tissues increased after 15 Gy WBI. The WBI before tumor implantation significantly increased the invasive ability of GL261 cells. VEGF and SDF-1alpha could promote invasion of GL261 cells even after high-dose irradiation. The combination of irradiation and inhibitors such as AMD3100 may prevent irradiation-stimulated dissemination of glioma cells.,Included

3679,"Evidence-based modelling of optimal CT simulation appointment length Background: The length of CT Simulation appointments impacts access to radiotherapy services; longer appointment lengths can result in decreased capacity for patient simulation. Aim(s): To develop evidence-based guidelines for CT simulation appointment length to increase capacity and improve access to radiotherapy clinical resources. Method(s): Phase 1 was a retrospective chart review of 60 patients selected in reverse chronological order from the CT simulation schedule for the following radiotherapy techniques: Breast tangent, CNS (brain and spine) IMRT and SBRT, Lung (including mesothelioma) IMRT and SBRT, Liver IMRT, Upper GI IMRT, Lymphoma mantle and Total Body Irradiation (TBI), and Head and Neck (H&N) IMRT. The duration of the CT simulation procedure was measured for each patient as the difference between the first and last time stamps in the radiation therapy electronic medical record. In Phase 2 an additional 5 minutes was added to each appointment length in Phase 1 to account for routine patient care activities (e.g. patient education) extending beyond the documented time stamps. Evidence-based appointment lengths for each technique were averaged, peer reviewed, and validated by CT simulation radiation therapist specialists. Current appointment lengths were matched to the evidence-based appointment lengths. Result(s): Liver, Lymphoma TBI, CNS spine SBRT, Lung SBRT and Mesothelioma evidence-based appointment lengths (45 min) were 25% less than current appointment lengths (60 min). Breast, CNS brain, Lung, Upper GI and H&N evidence-based appointment lengths (20 min) were 33% less than current appointment lengths (30 min). Implementation of the evidencebased appointment lengths at an academic cancer centre with 4 CT simulators resulted in an overall net gain of 2880 minutes (equivalent to 96 30 minute appointments) of CT simulation time per month.

3920,"Assessment of the proliferative activity and radiosensitivity of human tumours using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay We established an in vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay of human tumours for estimation of the proportion of cells undergoing mitosis (the dividing fraction, DF), the time for the number of nuclei to double and the radiosensitivity in terms of the micronucleus frequency, based on a concept described previously. Under certain conditions, the nuclear number doubling time (NNDT) was considered to represent the potential doubling time. Tumour specimens obtained at surgery were disaggregated into single-cell suspensions and were directly cultured in the presence of cytochalasin B with or without irradiation. At various intervals, the percentage of multinucleate cells (the plateau value represented the DF), the average number of nuclei per cell and the number of micronuclei in binucleate cells were determined. DF and NNDT values were obtained in 58 of the 73 tumours investigated, and the micronucleus frequency was obtained in 54 of these 58 tumours. The DF ranged from 4.1% to 71% and the NNDT ranged from 3.1 to 83 days. A DF > or = 20% was associated with a higher recurrence rate in patients undergoing curative operation. A correlation was found between the NNDT and the time to relapse in patients with recurrent disease. The average number of micronuclei per binucleate cell at 2 Gy of irradiation (after subtraction of the value at 0 Gy) ranged from 0.052 to 0.35. Tumours which produced more micronuclei after irradiation showed a better response to radiotherapy.

The averages of three measurements were taken with and without the screen protector at different distances, settings of brightness, and Apple's night shift (NS) mode. Results were analyzed using paired t-tests.RESULTS: At 33 cm, 100% brightness, and 0% NS, the screen protector decreased intensity by 43.9%, 32.3%, and 34.9% for the iPhone 8, iPhone X, and iPad, respectively. At 33 cm and 100% brightness, increasing NS mode from 0% to 100% decreased intensity by 81.2%, 84.2%, and 86.5%.

3847,"Cerebral Cortex Regions Selectively Vulnerable to Radiation Dose-Dependent Atrophy PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: Neurologic deficits after brain radiation therapy (RT) typically involve decline in higher-order cognitive functions such as attention and memory rather than sensory defects or paralysis. We sought to determine whether areas of the cortex critical to cognition are selectively vulnerable to radiation dose-dependent atrophy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We measured change in cortical thickness in 54 primary brain tumor patients who underwent fractionated, partial brain RT. The study patients underwent high-resolution, volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (T1-weighted; T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, FLAIR) before RT and 1 year afterward. Semiautomated software was used to segment anatomic regions of the cerebral cortex for each patient. Cortical thickness was measured for each region before RT and 1 year afterward. Two higher-order cortical regions of interest (ROIs) were tested for association between radiation dose and cortical thinning: entorhinal (memory) and inferior parietal (attention/memory). For comparison, 2 primary cortex ROIs were also tested: pericalcarine (vision) and paracentral lobule (somatosensory/motor). Linear mixed-effects analyses were used to test all other cortical regions for significant radiation dose-dependent thickness change. Statistical significance was set at alpha = 0.05 using 2-tailed tests.RESULTS: Cortical atrophy was significantly associated with radiation dose in the entorhinal (P=.01) and inferior parietal ROIs (P=.02). By contrast, no significant radiation dose-dependent effect was found in the primary cortex ROIs (pericalcarine and paracentral lobule). In the whole-cortex analysis, 9 regions showed significant radiation dose-dependent atrophy, including areas responsible for memory, attention, and executive function (P<=.002).CONCLUSIONS: Areas of cerebral cortex important for higher-order cognition may be most vulnerable to radiation-related atrophy. This is consistent with clinical observations that brain radiation patients experience deficits in domains of memory, executive function, and attention. Correlations of regional cortical atrophy with domain-specific cognitive functioning in prospective trials are warranted.",Excluded

[Chinese] BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The recurrence rate in skull base is high for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement. This study was conducted to explore the impact of dose boost in skull base on the recurrence in skull base and survival of NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement. METHOD(S): A total of 120 stage T4 NPC patients with cavernous sinus or/and sphenoid sinus involvement proved by histopathology and computed tomography (CT) were treated in our hospital from Oct. 1996 to Nov. 1998. The irradiation dose was (71.55+/-3.09) Gy in nasopharynx and (58.95+/-6.16) Gy in neck. Of the 120 patients, 27 received irradiation (6-10 Gy) in skull base after radiotherapy (boost group), 93 did not receive irradiation in skull base (control group). Fifty-three patients, 41 in control group and 12 in boost group, received cisplatin-based chemotherapy for 1-3 cycles. The survival rates and the recurrence of the 2 groups were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. RESULT(S): The clinical characteristics of patients were similar in the 2 groups. The 1-, 3-, 5-year skull base control rates were significantly higher in boost group than in control group (100% vs. 93.4%, 91.8% vs. 76.4%, and 86.8% vs. 65.1%, respectively, P=0.045).

Twenty-seven strains from patients who were previously diagnosed to have ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) were positive for this feature.

Four strains demonstrated RDS that was less pronounced than in most AT cells: one was from a patient with Nijmegen breakage syndrome, one was from a patient without ataxia but with choreiform movement disorder, telangiectasia, and elevated concentrations of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood, and two were from AT patients.

The median OS was 9 months after fSRT (95% confidence interval 4.104-13.896). Large tumor volume, presence of brainstem-related symptoms, poor pretreatment Karnofsky performance status, and recursive partition analysis class III were significantly associated with low overall survival. Tumor volume decreased in 18 metastatic lesions, remained stable in 6, and increased in 1. No patient exhibited permanent radiation injury. Grade 2 nausea and vomiting according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.0 occurred in 1 patient who received corticosteroids.CONCLUSIONS: Linac-based fSRT with a micro-multileaf collimator delivered in the doses of 24-40 Gy in 7-13 fractions is a safe and effective local therapy for patients with BSM.",Excluded
4185,"Proteome-wide Adaptations of Mouse Skeletal Muscles during a Full Month in Space The safety of space flight is challenged by a severe loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and endurance that may compromise the health and performance of astronauts. The molecular mechanisms underpinning muscle atrophy and decreased performance have been studied mostly after short duration flights and are still not fully elucidated. By deciphering the muscle proteome changes elicited in mice after a full month aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite, we observed that the antigravity soleus incurred the greatest changes compared with locomotor muscles. Proteomics data notably suggested mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic and fiber type switching toward glycolytic type II fibers, structural alterations, and calcium signaling-related defects to be the main causes for decreased muscle performance in flown mice. Alterations of the protein balance, mTOR pathway, myogenesis, and apoptosis were expected to contribute to muscle atrophy. Moreover, several signs reflecting alteration of telomere maintenance, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance were found as possible additional deleterious effects. Finally, 8 days of recovery post flight were not sufficient to restore completely flight-induced changes. Thus in-depth proteomics analysis unraveled the complex and multifactorial remodeling of skeletal muscle structure and function during long-term space flight, which should help define combined sets of countermeasures before, during, and after the flight.",Included
3892,"Mitochondrial Degeneration and Autophagy Associated With Delayed Effects of Radiation in the Mouse Brain Mitochondria are linked with various radiation responses, including mitophagy, genomic instability, apoptosis, and the bystander effect. Mitochondria play an important role in preserving cellular homeostasis during stress responses, and dysfunction in mitochondrial contributes to aging, carcinogenesis and neurologic diseases. In this study, we have investigated the mitochondrial degeneration and autophagy in the hippocampal region of brains from mice administered with BBT-059, a long-acting interleukin-11 analog, or its formulation buffer 24 h prior to irradiation at different radiation doses collected at 6 and 12 months post-irradiation. The results demonstrated a higher number of degenerating mitochondria in 12 Gy BBT-059 treated mice after 6 months and 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice after 12 months as compared to the age-matched naive (non-irradiated control animals). Apg5l, Lc3b and Sqstm1 markers were used to analyze the autophagy in the brain, however only the Sqstm1 marker exhibited significantly reduced expression after 12 months in 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice as compared to naive. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results of Bcl2 also demonstrated a decrease in expression after 12 months in 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice as compared to other groups. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that higher doses of ionizing radiation (IR) can cause persistent upregulation of mitochondrial degeneration. Reduced levels of Sqstm1 and Bcl2 can lead to intensive autophagy which can lead to degradation of cellular structure.",Included

[French] Introduction: Meme s'il est recommande d'utiliser la classification TNM, la prise en charge des CPC reste pragmatiquement basee sur la classification du Veterans Administration Lung Cancer Study Group. Etat des connaissances: Le traitement de premiere ligne des CPC dissemines fait appel a la chimiotherapie, et plus particulierement a l'association cisplatine-etoposide. En cas de CPC localise, la chimiotherapie est associee a une radiotherapie precoce, de preference acceleree hyperfractionnee. Quel que soit le stade, une irradiation cranienne propylactique est proposee chez les repondeurs. Le traitement de deuxieme ligne fait appel a la reintroduction de la chimiotherapie initiale en cas de CPC considere comme chimiosensible, et a une monotherapie, le topotecan, dans les CPC refractaires. Il n'existe actuellement aucune place pour les therapies ciblees en routine. Conclusions et perspectives: Compte tenu de la diminution de l'incidence du CPC, le nombre d'essais s'interessant aux CPC est egalement moindre. Des questions restent cependant irresolues et de meilleurs resultats de survie peuvent encore etre esperes. Actuellement, les efforts sont surtout tournes vers le demantelement moleculaire des CPC et le developpement de therapies ciblees en miroir des modifications biologiques identifiees. Introduction: It is recommended to use both the TNM classification and the Veterans Administration Lung Cancer Study Group classification to stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Treatment strategies can in most cases be pragmatically based on the limited (LS) versus extensive stage (ES) definitions. State of the Art: First line treatment of ES SCLC is chemotherapy, and particularly the cisplatin-etoposide combination. In LS SCLC, chemotherapy and early thoracic irradiation (preferentially hyper-fractionated accelerated radiotherapy) is standard treatment. Prophylactic cranial irradiation has been shown to prolong survival in responders with both LS and ES disease. Second line treatment consists of reintroduction of the firstline chemotherapy regimen in chemosensitive tumors. In patients with refractory SCLC, single-agent topotecan can be given as second line treatment. There is no indication for targeted therapy outside clinical trials. Conclusion(s): Because of a reduction in the proportion of SCLC, the number of trials addressing SCLC is decreasing. However, there are still many unanswered questions and better survival results are needed. Efforts for molecular subtyping of SCLC are ongoing, with the parallel search for therapies targeting the identified biomarkers. 2013 SPLF. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

3916,"Connecting radiotherapy with targeted anti-glioma therapy using superparamagnetic nanoparticles conjugated with granzyme B INTRODUCTION: 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) is overexpressed on the membrane of the glioblastoma cells, but not on corresponding normal cells. Membrane-bound Hsp70 (i.e., mHsp70) is rapidly internalized into tumor cells and thus targeting the protein might provide a promising strategy for theranostics. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are contrast negative agents that are used for the detection of tumors with MRI. In the presented study we conjugated the protease Granzyme B which is known to recognize mHsp70 to superparamagnetic iron nanoparticles to assess tumor-specific theranostic targeting before and after radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Synthesized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles covered with Granzyme B protease (GrB-SPIONs) were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering, NMR relaxometry. Cellular interactions of the GrB-SPIONs conjugates with tumor cell lines (i.e., U87, LN229, C6, K562, HeLa) were assessed using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and TEM. Brain tumor targeting was analyzed in the orthotopic C6 glioma model in rats, human U87 and LN229 gliomas in nu/nu mice. Following intravenous administration retention of the nanoparticles in the tumor site was assessed using high-field 11.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with subsequent histological assay. Biodistribution studies of the SPIONs were performed by NLR-M2 measurements. Combination of the nanoparticle targeting with radiotherapy of the brain tumors was performed at small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) (Xstrahl Inc., UK) using single of fractionated irradiation. RESULT(S): In vitro experiments demonstrated the selectivity of GrB-SPIONs conjugates to free and mHsp70 in different tumor cell types in a dose-dependent manner. High-resolution MRI on T2-weighted images showed the retention of the conjugates in C6 glioma model in rats, and U87 and LN229 human orthotopic glioma models in nu/nu mice. Accumulation of GrB-SPION nanoparticles in the glioma resulted in many-fold drop of T2-values in comparison to non-conjugated SPIONs. Biodistribution analysis using NLR-M2 measurements showed an increase in the tumor-to-background (normal brain) uptake ratio of GrB-SPIONs conjugates in glioma-bearing animals in comparison to SPIONs. Accumulation within Hsp70-positive glioma was enhanced after a single dose (10 Gy) of ionizing radiation. Combination of the radiotherapy and application of the GrB-SPIONs significantly increased the survival of the glioma-bearing animals. CONCLUSION(S): Elevated accumulation of the functionalized magnetic nanoparticles in the tumor due to radiosensitization proves the combination of radiotherapy and application of Hsp70-targeted agents such as Granzyme B in the theranostics of brain tumors.",Excluded
4164,"Evaluation of novel modified tangential irradiation technique for breast cancer patients using dose-volume histograms Purpose We have previously reported that entire axillary lymph node regions could be irradiated by the modified tangential irradiation technique (MTIT). In this study, MTIT was compared with a conventional irradiation technique (CTIT) using dose-volume histograms to verify how adequately MTIT covers the breast and axillary lymph node region and the extent to which it involves the lung and heart. Methods and materials Forty-four patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated by lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and postoperative radiotherapy. Twenty-two patients were treated with MTIT and 22 with CTIT. In 25 patients, the breast tumor was on the left and in 19 on the right. During axillary dissection, surgical clips were left as markers at the border of the axillary lymph node region. MTIT was planned by setting the dorsal edge of the radiation field on a lateral-view simulator film at the dorsal edge of the humeral head and the cranial edge of the radiation field at the caudal edge of the humeral head. CTIT was planned to ensure radiation of the breast tissue without considering the axillary region. In this study, all patients underwent computed tomography, and the CT data were transmitted on-line to a radiotherapy planning system, in which the dose-distribution computed tomography images and dose-volume histograms were calculated by defining the breast, axillary region (levels I, II, and III), lung, and heart region. Results Dose-volume histogram analysis demonstrated that breast tissue was radiated with an 86.5-100% volume (median 96.5%) by MTIT and an 83-100% volume (median, 95%) by CTIT at >95% of the isocenter dose. The axillary lymph node regions at Levels I, II, and III were irradiated with 84-100% (median, 94.5%), 59-100% (median, 89%), and 70-100% (median, 89.5%) volumes, respectively, by MTIT and with 2-84% (median, 38%), 0-53% (median, 15%), and 0-31% (median, 0%) volumes, respectively, by CTIT at >70% of the isocenter dose. The ipsilateral lung was irradiated with a 5-22% volume (median, 11.5%) by MTIT and 5-15% volume (median 9%) by CTIT at >90% of the isocenter dose. In all 25 left-sided breast cancer patients, the volumes irradiated with an 80% isocenter dose were <30 cm<sup>3</sup>. Conclusion The results of our study demonstrated that the breast tissue was sufficiently irradiated with both CTIT and MTIT planning, the axillary lymph node areas irradiated by MTIT were much wider than those irradiated by CTIT at all levels, and the lung and heart volumes irradiated by MTIT were small.

4264,"De Novo Development of Moyamoya Disease after Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Arteriovenous Malformation in a Patient With RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys (rs112735431) BACKGROUND: Reports of cases diagnosed as Moyamoya disease (MMD) after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are extremely rare. In recent years, ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) has been identified as a susceptibility gene of MMD, but the mechanism by which MMD develops remains unclear. Those cases of de novo development of MMD may provide some clues to clarify the mechanism of progression of MMD.CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of de novo MMD that developed after SRS for AVM. This patient presented with a variant of the RNF213 gene. The intracranial internal carotid artery was not within the irradiation field; therefore it was obvious that the development of MMD was not caused by the direct effect of radiation in the current case study. Moreover, we demonstrated the decrease in velocity in the internal carotid artery prior to the development of MMD using phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography. Previous studies demonstrated that progression of the pathological condition in the cerebral arteries in response to hemodynamic changes is enhanced in patients with RNF213 variants.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the changes in the intracranial hemodynamics after SRS for AVM could trigger the de novo onset of MMD in patients with a genetic predisposition for the RNF213 variant.",Excluded
3716,"Prevalence of abnormal brain CT scan finding in patients with headache: Two year study in Imam Hospital. [Arabic] Background: Headache is one of the most common problems that bring patients to doctors' offices. Many physicians order neuroimaging studies after taking the history of the patient and performing a physical examination. These neuroimaging studies are often requested due to the probable existence of an intracranial lesion. However, at times they are requested to allay the fears of patients or even doctors. Most of these studies are normal and the question arises whether there is any indication for requesting neuroimaging studies for a patient with an isolated headache. Method(s): We studied 146 patients with headache who had been referred for CT scan to the imaging center of Imam Khomeini Hospital during 2004-2005. For each patient, a questionnaire, including the medical history and accompanying neurological symptoms, was filled out and CT scan results were gathered. Result(s): The mean of age of the patients was 37.8 years, and 69% were female. Only 10 patients (6.8%) had a brain lesion in the CT scan. Accompanying neurological symptoms were more frequent in patients with abnormal rather than normal CT scans. There was a meaningful correlation between abnormal CT scan and paresthesia, ptosis, paresia, diplopia, visual loss, convulsion, vomiting and vertigo. A statistical correlation existed between gender and positive CT scan. Conclusion(s): Many patients with headache have normal brain CT scan results. Thus, better criteria are warranted for requesting neuroimaging including accurate patient history and neurological examination in order to prevent unnecessary radiation exposure. MRI instead of Cr scan would be a better first step toward the evaluation of the possible existence of brain lesions.",Excluded
4523,"Dorsal light response and changes of its responses under varying acceleration conditions In order to improve our understanding about functions of the gravity sensors, we have conducted four experiments in goldfish: 1) To define the effect of visual information influx on the static labyrinthine response, the dorsal light response (DLR) which had been proposed by von Holst as a model for postural adjustment in fish was reexamined with a newly designed, rotatory illumination device. The fish responded to illumination from the upper half of the visual field and a narrow range around 180 degrees of the lower half visual field. The maximal tilting angle of normal fish was about 40 degrees under horizontal illumination. 2) Under the changes of the gravito-inertial force level produced by a linear sled, the threshold of the gravity sensors was determined from postural adjustment responses. 3) Under hypogravic conditions during the parabolic flight of an airplane, the light-dependent behavior was investigated in intact and labyrinthectomized goldfish. 4) As one of the most likely candidates of the neural centers for the DLR, the valvula cerebelli, which receives its visual information not through the optic tectum but through the pretectal areas, is confirmed by the brain lesion experiments.",Excluded
3744,"GDNF and TGF-beta1 promote cell survival in serum-free cultures of primary rat microglia Recent evidence indicates that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) may influence microglial survival, proliferation, and activation, but this has not yet been tested on isolated primary microglia. We compared the effects of individual and combined application of 10 ng/ml GDNF and 1 ng/ml transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) on total cell number, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, DNA nick-end labelling (TUNEL staining), and nitrite and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) secretion in serum-free cultures of primary rat microglia. GDNF as well as TGF-beta1 enhanced the total number of lectin-positive cells and decreased the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei, while no effect on proliferation was observed. Both factors suppressed the secretion of nitrite during the first 4 days of culturing, and GDNF but not TGF-beta1 reduced the secretion of LDH in 2-week-old cultures. These findings suggest that GDNF and TGF-beta1 support survival of primary microglia in vitro.",Excluded
4079,"Reducing the dosimetric impact of positional errors in field junctions for craniospinal irradiation using VMAT AIM: To improve treatment plan robustness with respect to small shifts in patient position during the VMAT treatment by ensuring a linear ramp-like dose profile in treatment field overlap regions.BACKGROUND: Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is considered technically challenging because the target size exceeds the maximal field size, which necessitates using abutted or overlapping treatment fields. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is increasingly being examined for CSI, as it offers both better dose homogeneity and better dose conformance while also offering a possibility to create field junctions which are more robust towards small shifts in patient position during the treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A VMAT treatment plan with three isocenters was made for a test case patient. Three groups of overlapping arc field pairs were used; one for the cranial and two for the spinal part. In order to assure a ramp-like dose profile in the field overlap region, the upper spinal part was optimised first, with dose prescription explicitly enforcing a ramp-like dose profile. The cranial and lower spinal part were done afterwards, taking into account the dose contribution of the upper spinal fields.RESULTS: Using simple geometrical reasoning, we demonstrated that hot- and cold spots which arise from small displacement of one treatment field relative to the other treatment field can be reduced by taking two precautions: (a) widening the field overlap region, and (b) reducing the field gradient across the overlap region. The function with the smallest maximal gradient is a linear ramp. We present a treatment planning technique which yields the desired dose profile of the two contributing fields, and minimises dosimetric dependence on minor positional errors in patient set-up.",Excluded
3640,"Rapid activation of presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by nerve-released transmitter Nicotine's ability to enhance neurotransmitter release has implicated presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in synaptic modulation, but there aze few examples where presynaptic nAChRs are known to be activated by nerve-released transmitter. We searched for endogenous activation of presynaptic nAChRs in the calyceal nerve terminals of the chick ciliary ganglion by imaging presynaptic calcium transients using dextran-coupled indicator dyes. The amplitude of Ca(+)signals recorded in individual nerve terminals was frequency dependent over 2-50 Hz. Calcium transients evoked by stimulation of the preganglionic nerve were significantly reduced (approximately 10-15%) by the nonspecific nAChR antagonist d-tubocurarine (d-TC; 100 microM) and the alpha7-specific antagonist methyllycaconitine (20-50 nM) but were not affected by 10 microM dihydro-beta-erythroidine, which should inhibit several non-alpha7 nAChRs. Feedback was rapid and did not require a stimulation-dependent build-up of transmitter, as d-TC and MLA reduced the amplitude of the first calcium transient in a 2-Hz train. Choline is an agonist at alpha7 nAChRs but is not the sole agonist in this system, as inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by echothiophate failed to reduce calcium transients. These results show that nerve-released acetylcholine (ACh) feeds back onto presynaptic alpha7 nAChRs to enhance calcium signals within the terminal. This feedback may help maintain the high rate of transmission at this cholinergic synapse.",Excluded

We diagnosed this clinical situation as primary hyperthyroidism. Thyroid function returned to normal and the palpitation ceased 1 month after treatment with thiamazole. Plasma BNP concentration decreased but remained slightly high for 4 months and returned to the normal range 11 months after admission. M-mode echocardiogram showed normal contraction of the left ventricular wall throughout the clinical course, and mitral inflow velocity by pulsed Doppler method showed the E >A pattern on admission and an abnormal relaxation pattern 4 months after admission. Cyclic variation of integrated backscatter (IB) value in the left ventricular posterior wall was small at time of admission (3.6 dB), had increased 4 months later (7.7 dB), and was close to the normal range 11 months toper admission (8.7 dB).

4587,"Developing optic radiation tractography to reduce visual field deficits following anterior temporal lobe resection Objectives: Anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR) is an effective treatment for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. Damage to Meyer's loop of the optic radiation (OR) leads to postop visual field deficits (VFD) in 52-100% of patients and may prevent driving. The OR cannot be seen on clinical MRI sequences, but can be visualised using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. Incorporating these data into the neuronavigational system during surgery should reduce the risk of VFD. However, preop tractography is no longer valid due to brain shift/distortion. A new image registration technique to compensate for brain shift/distortion is described and validated it in a cohort of patients undergoing ATLR with the aim of using this to guide future neurosurgery. Method(s): Pre-/postop structural MRI and DTI scans were acquired on 16 patients undergoing ATLR. The OR was delinetaed using probabilistic tractography on preop data and propagated onto postop structural images using a novel image registration technique. Degree of resection was quantified by the maximum A-P distance between the anterior of the OR on the propagated tractography and the resection margin. Postop VFD was quantified as percentage of upper quadrant lost using Goldmann perimetry. Result(s): Postop VFD were seen in 8 patients (10-92% of the upper quadrant, mean 51%). In 8 patients without VFD, the propagated OR was 0.0-15.0 (mean 3.4 mm) posterior to the resection margin. In 8 patients with VFD, the propagated OR lay 3.8-15.9 (mean 7.7 mm) anterior to the resection margin. The Pearson correlation coefficient between A-P distance and VFD was 0.809 (one-tailed p = 0.008). Linear regression showed for each additional 1 mm of resection, 5.8% more upper quadrant vision was lost. Mean image registration time by implementation on a GPU (graphical processing unit) was 3.2 min. Conclusion(s): A novel non-linear registration algorithm was used to propagate preop OR tractography onto postop images. Results obtained were highly predictive of the VFD. MRI and DTI scans can be acquired during surgery in an interventional MRI suite. As transfer of the patient from the MRI scanner back to the operating table takes 7-10 min, the algorithm is fast enough to be applied to propagate preop tractography onto intraop images before surgery recommences. Future work will display the propagated tractography to the surgeon in the neuronavigation system to determine whether this additional information can reduce the risk of a VFD.",Excluded

The Elekta Synergy S with dissociated simultaneous multiple port (dose islands) within a single field. This simultaneous-treatment technique enables us to more efficiently treat two lesions concurrently when each target conforms to the radiosurgery protocol. Materials/Methods:We created a clinical reference plan (CRP), which has optimized dose coverage, conformity, homogeneity, and step-wise fall-off to zero dose.We then applied orthogonal-to-spherical coordinate system transformations about the isocenter, to each individual beam's parameters that simulated the multiple rotational errors for this research. For each patient (n = 10) 24 experimental treatment plan (ETP) calculations were. For each ETP , DVHs were computed for the two PTVs, optic nerves, optic chiasm and brainstem. From all of the DVH data, critical analytical indices were computed and compared to the CRP. These analytical indices include: Coverage, conformity, Dose Homogeneity, and Dose Gradient. A neurosurgical team evaluated the plans and subjectively evaluated the clinical suitability of each plan. The accumulated indices were scored and weighted to obtain a single value, the Unified Dosimetry Index (UDI). The UDI represents a plan's suitability vis-a-vis the CRP. Result(s): From the computed UDIs we observed that ETPs with 1-2 degrees of rotation remain within the defined range of suitability for clinical treatment. Rotation errors greater than 2 degrees resulted in UDI outside the clinically acceptable range. Conclusion(s): Isocenter rotations of 3 degrees or more significantly reduces the quality of clinical SRS treatments. Small lesions are especially vulnerable to loss of dosimetric coverage. SRS treatment setup should have a combined rotational error less than 2.5 degrees to effectively deliver the prescribed radiation dose using multiple brain lesions with mono-isocentric technique.",Excluded

Each patient had both a planning CT and weekly repeated CT. Simulated plans that were generated by using the same beam configurations mapped to the repeated CT represented the actual delivered doses to the target volumes and OARs. An IMRT replanning was performed with the fifth week CT scan. Doses among the initial plan, the simulated plans and replanning were compared.RESULTS: There were no significant dosimetric differences in the gross tumour volume, clinical target volume (CTV) 1 or CTV2 for either the simulated plans or the replanning compared with the initial plan. Dosimetric variability of both parotid glands and the brain stem were unique to each individual, and doses to the spinal cord were always maintained within the limit. Replanning in the fifth week had significantly decreased the doses delivered to both parotids (p-values of the mean dose were 0.015 and 0.026 for the left and right parotid, respectively), whereas it did not reduce the doses to the brain stem and spinal cord. There was no relationship between dose variability and weight loss.CONCLUSIONS: There are no significant dose changes for target volumes and spinal cord, and doses to the brain stem and both parotid glands changed individually during NPC IMRT. Replanning helps to spare bilateral parotids.",Excluded

In this field, researchers and/or clinicians are combining modern tools of molecular and cell biology with state of the art technology in order to noninvasively image living subjects. Various imaging modalities such as optics (fluorescence and luminescence), nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and radiation are being used to visually capture and study molecular and cellular events in living organisms. Among these modalities, nuclear medical molecular imaging uses radionuclides [i.e., positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)], and has characteristic properties that allow researchers and/or clinicians to obtain functional images of living subjects with high sensitivity. Translational molecular imaging, a research step between animal experiments and the clinical setting, has been successful when using nuclear medical molecular imaging.

The system was then configured with extra image noise reduction algorithms and system settings, which enabled radiation dose reduction without loss of image quality. Radiation dose data from 174 neuroangiographies and 138 interventional neuroprocedures were collected for the period January-June 2012. Procedures were classified as diagnostic or interventional. Patient radiation exposure was quantified using cumulative dose area product and cumulative air kerma. Impact on working habits of the physician was quantified using fluoroscopy time and number of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images.RESULTS: The optimized system settings provided significant reduction in dose indicators versus reference system settings (p<0.001): from 124 to 47 Gy cm(2) and from 0.78 to 0.27 Gy for neuroangiography, and from 328 to 109 Gy cm(2) and from 2.71 to 0.89 Gy for interventional neuroradiology. Differences were not significant between the two systems with regard to fluoroscopy time or number of DSA images.CONCLUSION: X-ray imaging technology using an image noise reduction algorithm and system settings provided approximately 60% radiation dose reduction in neuroangiography and interventional neuroradiology, without affecting the working habits of the physician.",Excluded
4223,"Hydrocephalus in radiation leukoencephalopathy: results of ventriculoperitoneal shunting OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical benefit of ventriculoperitoneal shunting in patients suffering from radiotherapy-induced leukoencephalopathy.DESIGN: Retrospective review of a single institutional experience.PATIENTS: Thirty-one patients with the postradiotherapy syndrome received ventriculoperitoneal shunts. All had a history of cranial irradiation, progressive ventriculomegaly visible on neuroimaging scans, and neurologic decline; other causes of hydrocephalus were excluded. All 31 patients had cognitive deficits: 30 had gait disturbance and 24 were incontinent.RESULTS: Twenty-four (80%) of 30 assessable patients achieved symptomatic improvement an average of 1.6 months after ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Incontinence and gait problems were more likely to improve than cognition. Sixteen (53%) of 30 patients achieved a good overall functional outcome, and incontinence was the only feature significantly associated with good outcome (P=.04). Neither cerebrospinal fluid-opening pressure nor tap tests predicted improvement from ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Median duration of improvement was 6 months, and median survival after receiving the shunt was 14.5 months. Shunt-related complications occurred in 10 (33%) of 30 patients, with 1 fatal outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Our results from ventriculoperitoneal shunting in selected patients with radiation-induced hydrocephalus suggest potential benefit. Improvement is incomplete and temporary, but can improve quality of life. Reliable predictors of successful shunt outcome were not identified.",Excluded
4631,"Irradiation of 850-nm laser light changes the neural activities in rat primary visual cortex Although infrared laser was proven to be an alternative approach for neural stimulation, there is very little known about the neural response to infrared laser irradiation in visual cortex. This study is to investigate the effect of near-infrared laser irradiation on neural activities at the cortex level. A 850-nm pigtailed diode laser was applied to stimulate the rat primary visual cortex while the horizontal black and white stripe pattern was used as standard visual stimulation to evoke visual-evoked potential (VEP). Both amplitude and latency of VEP P100 was measured with or without infrared pulse stimulation applied in rat primary visual cortex. Paired t test and one-way analysis of variance were used to evaluate the impact of infrared irradiation and its pulse width on the amplitudes and latencies of P100, respectively. The results from our preliminary study revealed that, the pulsed near-infrared laser depressed the VEP amplitude and shortened the latency of P100; with the increment of pulse width of infrared irradiation, further decline of VEP amplitude and much shortened latency of P100 were observed. The present work suggests that near-infrared laser irradiation can alter the neural activities in primary visual cortex transiently, and could provide a novel contactless artificial neural stimulus to brain cortex with high spatial selectivity.",Excluded

Gene therapy represents a promising approach for this disease. A requisite component for improving gene-based therapies of brain cancer includes tumor suppressor genes that exhibit cancer constrained inhibitory activity. Subtraction hybridization identified melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (mda-7) as a gene associated with melanoma cell growth, differentiation and progression. Ectopic expression of mda-7 by means of a replication-incompetent adenovirus (Ad), Ad.mda-7, induces growth suppression and apoptosis selectively in diverse human cancers, without producing any apparent harmful effect in normal cells. We presently demonstrate that Ad.mda-7 induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in malignant human gliomas expressing both mutant and wild-type p53, and these effects correlate with an elevation in expression of members of the growth arrest and DNA damage (GADD) gene family. In contrast, infection with a recombinant Ad expressing wild-type p53, Ad.wtp53, specifically affects mutant p53 expressing gliomas. When tested in early passage normal and immortal human fetal astrocytes, growth inhibition resulting from infection with Ad.mda-7 or Ad.wtp53 is significantly less than in malignant gliomas and no toxicity is evident in these normal cells. Moreover, infection of gliomas with Ad.mda-7 or treatment with purified GST-MDA-7 protein sensitizes both wild-type and mutant p53 expressing tumor cells to the growth inhibitory and antisurvival effects of ionizing radiation, and this response correlates with increased expression of specific members of the GADD gene family. Since heterogeneity in p53 expression is common in evolving gliomas, the present findings suggest that Ad.mda-7 may, in many instances, prove more beneficial for the gene-based therapy of malignant gliomas than administration of wild-type p53.",Excluded

3770,"Low-power inversion recovery MRI preserves brain tissue contrast for patients with Parkinson disease with deep brain stimulators BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fast spin-echo short tau inversion recovery sequences have been very useful for MR imaging-guided deep brain stimulation procedures in Parkinson disease. However, high-quality fast spin-echo imaging deposits significant heat, exceeding FDA-approved limits when patients already have undergone deep brain stimulation and need a second one or a routine brain MR imaging for neurologic indications. We have developed a STIR sequence with an ultra-low specific absorption rate that meets hardware limitations and produces adequate tissue contrast in cortical and subcortical brain tissues for deep brain stimulation recipients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with medically refractory Parkinson disease who qualified for deep brain stimulation were imaged at 1.5T with a fast spin-echo short tau inversion recovery sequence modified to meet conditional MR imaging hardware and specific absorption rate restrictions. Tissue contrast-to-noise ratios and implant localization were objectively and subjectively compared by 2 neuroradiologists, and image quality for surgical planning was assessed by a neurosurgeon for high and low specific absorption rate images.RESULTS: The mean contrast-to-noise ratio for cerebral tissues without including the contrast-to-noise ratio for ventricular fluid was 35 and 31 for high and low specific absorption rate images. Subjective ratings for low specific absorption rate tissue contrast in 77% of patients were identical to (and in a few cases higher than) those of high specific absorption rate contrast, while the neurosurgical coordinates for fusing the stereotactic atlas with low specific absorption rate MR imaging were equivalent to those of the high specific absorption rate for 69% of patients.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Parkinson disease who have already had a deep brain stimulation face a risk of neural injury if routine, high specific absorption rate MR imaging is performed. Our modified fast spin-echo short tau inversion recovery sequence conforms to very conservative radiofrequency safety limits, while it maintains high tissue contrast for presurgical planning, postsurgical assessment, and radiologic evaluations with greater confidence for radiofrequency safety.",Excluded

Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of <sup>52</sup>MnCl<inf>2</inf> at tracer doses has the potential to allow similar Mn studies as manganese-enhanced MRI while providing quantitative results and avoiding toxic effects. In this work, <sup>52</sup>MnCl<inf>2</inf> is produced and characterized as a PET tracer in phantoms and in rats. Method(s): <sup>52</sup>MnCl<inf>2</inf> was produced by proton irradiation of natural Cr foil and separated by column chromatography. Images were acquired on a Siemens Focus 120 small animal PET scanner. Phantom images were acquired to assess uniformity, resolution, cascade background correction, and count rate linearity. Images of rats were also acquired after systemic and intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of <sup>52</sup>MnCl<inf>2</inf> to investigate Mn(II) distribution in vivo. Result(s): Irradiation yield was 74.6 +/- 8.5 kBqmuA min <sup>52</sup>Mn at end of bombardment with initial specific activity of at least 3.5 MBqnmol. <sup>52</sup>Mn PET images show similar uniformity and resolution to <sup>18</sup>F. <sup>18</sup>F based detector efficiency normalization is adequate for <sup>52</sup>Mn imaging. Subtraction of a rescaled random events distribution from sinogram data is effective for cascade correction of <sup>52</sup>Mn PET data.

4688,"Serum exosome proteomic profiling reveals molecular fingerprints of tissue injury caused by cancer chemotherapy Exosomes are nanovesicles released from most cell types especially under cellular stress conditions including oxidative stress. It is well-recognized that in addition to ionizing radiation, nearly 50% of FDA- approved chemotherapeutics cause oxidative stress in target tissues. However, the tissue origin and contents of exosomes released from chemotherapy-treated cells and their contribution to tissue injury are unknown. Here we report that in human serum, exosomes isolated from cancer patients (n = 24) exhibit a significantly higher level of 4-hydroxynonenal adducted proteins post-chemotherapy (P<0.02). In mice, systemic injection of chemotherapeutic drugs exemplified by Doxorubicin (DOX) caused a two-fold increase in circulating exosomes (DOX-EXO) compared to saline-treated controls (SAL-EXO). The authenticity of exosomes in the serum was characterized by electron microscopy and by identification of exosome markers, including Alix, CD 63, and TSG 101. Dynamic light scattering analysis showed that DOX-EXO has broader size distribution shifting to the larger size (25-200 nm) compared to SAL-EXO (10-120 nm). Proteomic analysis of mouse serum exosomes identified 329 and 275 proteins in SAL-EXO and DOX-EXO, respectively. Interestingly, proteins found in DOX-EXO serum, include glycogen phosphorylase brain, liver and muscle forms, implicate brain, liver and muscle as the source of exosomes in Dox treated animals. Proteins distinctly expressed in DOX-EXO serum also include proteins involved in DNA repair (XRCC3 and ERCC6), autophagy (TM9S1), and metabolic process (pyruvate kinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase). Thus, circulating exosomes are sensitive markers for tissues targeted by redox active chemotherapy and serve as cargo-carrying vehicles for the metabolic and repair proteins necessary for defense against chemotherapy-induced tissue injury.",Excluded

DAPI-labeling detection was used to trace the origin of the repopulating cells. DAPI fluorescence was used to identify retina cells of bone marrow origin 10, 20, 35 and 50 days after transplantation. No formation of rosettes was found but some random cells were found at the end of the observation. MSCs-originated cells spread more widely in the injured retinas than in the normal ones. Immunohistochemical detection showed that though the cells could express neuronal nuclei (NeuN), neuron specific enolase (NSE), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cytokeratin (CK), the proteins expression in the injured transplantation group was abnormal in some region compared with that in the normal transplantation group. Electroretinogram (ERG) showed that ERG-b wave of the injured transplantation group is significantly higher than that of the two laser-injured control groups. These results suggest that a proportion of MSCs can differentiate into retina-like structure in vivo and the differentiation differs in normal and laser-injured retinas.",Excluded

Detection and pain thresholds for cold sensations were compared following low frequency (1 Hz) (Experiment 1) and high frequency (20 Hz) (Experiment 2) repetitive TMS.

Autopsy at age 59 revealed diffuse changes in the white matter consisting in order of severity of myelin pallor, demyelination, and necrosis which were characterized by a lack of glial reaction. The cerebral cortex was relatively well preserved. As delayed radiation injuries, hyalinous changes in the vascular wall, angiomatous lesions and, fresh and old petechial hemorrhages were found. Moreover, vascular changes associated with arteriosclerosis were also present. Furthermore, a focal glial nodule was detected which was considered to be a new radiation-induced neoplasia. These findings suggest that late delayed radiation injury may slowly develop over 30 years and may involve damage to neuroglial stem cell compensation. It is also evident that arteriosclerotic changes and newly induced neoplasia may develop in delayed radiation injury cases.",Excluded
4028,"""Soundmorphing"": a new approach to studying speech perception in humans A problem in current studies of brain activation in speech perception is that most studies use stimuli that are sampled from different categories. This study presents a new approach in creating acoustic stimuli by filtering real words in different ways, thus this enables one to 'morph' the sounds gradually from something like tones to real words while preserving temporal characteristics (""soundmorphing""). This will make it possible to explore steps between tone and speech processing on a gradual scale. This study aimed to investigate more closely the network, involved in the perception of speech and the decoding of auditory (speech-)stimuli. Sets of auditory stimuli were created by dividing real words into several frequency-bands and creating a randomised rearrangement of these components. Four different sets of stimuli were used, containing 1, 2, 3 or 4 frequency bands (total range: 0-2500 Hz). Only the latter one contained intelligible words. During the fMRI session, these four trial types were presented pseudo-randomised. In all conditions, significant activations of auditory cortex were observed. The number of activated voxels and their significance increased over the four trial types. In addition, Broca's area, SMA, left thalamus, and right cerebellum were activated in the most complex and most speech-like condition. Comparing these complexes with the tone-like trials, only the left auditory cortex, left SMA, and cingulate gyrus became significant. These activations reflect the bilateral processing of the auditory stimuli, but only the left temporal areas demonstrated an increasing BOLD response with an increasing number of presented frequency components.",Excluded

ASICs are expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons, and several lines of evidence suggest that they are responsible for signaling the pain caused by extracellular acidification, but little is understood of the modulation of ASICs by pro-inflammatory factors. Using whole-cell patch clamp we demonstrate that low pH evokes three distinct inward currents in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons: a slowly inactivating transient current, a rapidly inactivating transient current, and a sustained current. All three currents were potentiated by arachidonic acid (AA), to 123%, 171%, and 264% of peak current, respectively. Membrane stretch had no effect on proton-gated currents, implying that AA is unlikely to act via local membrane deformation. The current carried by heterologously expressed ASIC1a and ASIC3 was also potentiated by AA. AA potentiates ASIC activation by a direct mechanism, because inhibition of AA metabolism had no effect on potentiation, and potentiation of single ASIC2a channels could be observed in cell-free patches. Potentiation by lipids with the same chain length as AA increased as the number of double bonds was increased. AA is known to be released in inflammation and the results suggest that AA may be an important pro-inflammatory agent responsible for enhancing acid-mediated pain.",Excluded

This review summarizes a series of neuroimaging studies investigating the brain mechanisms underlying the latter stimulating impact of light. Results of these studies are compatible with a scenario where light would first hit subcortical areas involved in arousal regulation before affecting cortical areas involved in the ongoing non-visual cognitive process, and then cognitive performance. Recent data demonstrated that the non-visual impact of light is most likely triggered via outputs from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which are maximally sensitive to blue light. In addition, the stimulating impact of light is intimately related to wakefulness regulation as it changes with circadian phase and sleep pressure. Finally, markers of inter-individual difference have also been described: age, PERIOD3 genotype, and psychiatric status.

In pentobarbitone-anaesthetised rats, application of MV at combined high frequencies and volumes (representing threshold levels) produced apnea. The apnea persisted as long as MV was maintained at or above the threshold frequency and volume. Following removal of MV, inherent breathing did not resume immediately, with the diaphragm exhibiting post-mechanical ventilation apnea. The fall in arterial P(CO2) (Pa(CO2)) levels evoked by MV-engendered hyperventilation was shown not to be the trigger for initiation of apnea. MV-induced apnea was immediately reversed by bilateral vagotomy. Further, MV-induced apnea could not be evoked in bilaterally vagotomized animals suggesting that vagal feedback is the critical pathway for its initiation. NTS inspiratory neurones were inhibited during both MV-induced apnea and post-mechanical ventilation apnea, implying the involvement of central neural mechanisms in mediating this effect.",Excluded
4126,"Perceptual costs for motion transparency evaluated by two performance measures Transparency perception is recognized as one of the important phenomena to understand the computational mechanism of early visual system. Transparency perception indicates that a simple theory reconstructing a single-valued field of a visual attribute, such as an optical-flow field, cannot model the neural mechanism for the human visual system and raises a fundamental issue of how visual attributes are represented and detected in the brain. It is considered that one of the important cues to reveal the neural encoding mechanism for overlapping surfaces is the perceptual cost in transparency perception. It has been known that the perceptual performance in motion transparency is worse than that expected from single motion perception. This perceptual ""cost"" would reflect the encoding strategy for transparent motions. Here we present a systematic study comparing the perceptual costs in motion transparency evaluated by two performance measures. The result showed that the properties of the perceptual costs varied with the performance measures. The perceptual cost evaluated by the motion detection threshold became smaller as a directional difference between overlapping motions increased, whereas the cost examined with the precision of directional judgments became worse. A computational analysis suggests that these contradictory results cannot be explained by a simple population coding model for motion directions.",Excluded

Acupuncture analgesia has been confirmed by numerous clinical observations and experimental studies to be a useful treatment to release different kinds of pains, including inflammatory pain and hyperalgesia. However, the underlying mechanisms of the analgesic effect of acupuncture are not fully understood. In the present study, using a rat model of inflammatory pain induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), we observed the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on animal behavior with regard to pain and the expression of a subunit of NMDA receptor (NR1) and isolectin B4 (IB4) in the neurons of the lumbar DRG. Intraplantar injection of 50 microl CFA resulted in considerable changes in thermal hyperalgesia, edema of the hind paw and ""foot-bend"" score, beginning 5 h post-injection and persisting for a few days, after which a gradual recovery occurred.

3742,"A Protocol for Transcranial Photobiomodulation Therapy in Mice Transcranial photobiomodulation is a potential innovative noninvasive therapeutic approach for improving brain bioenergetics, brain function in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders, and memory enhancement in age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. We describe a laboratory protocol for transcranial photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) in mice. Aged BALB/c mice (18 months old) are treated with a 660 nm laser transcranially, once daily for 2 weeks. Laser transmittance data shows that approximately 1% of the incident red light on the scalp reaches a 1 mm depth from the cortical surface, penetrating the dorsal hippocampus. Treatment outcomes are assessed by two methods: a Barnes maze test, which is a hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory task evaluation, and measuring hippocampal ATP levels, which is used as a bioenergetics index. The results from the Barnes task show an enhancement of the spatial memory in laser-treated aged mice when compared with age-matched controls. Biochemical analysis after laser treatment indicates increased hippocampal ATP levels. We postulate that the enhancement of memory performance is potentially due to an improvement in hippocampal energy metabolism induced by the red laser treatment. The observations in mice could be extended to other animal models since this protocol could potentially be adapted to other species frequently used in translational neuroscience, such as rabbit, cat, dog, or monkey. Transcranial photobiomodulation is a safe and cost-effective modality which may be a promising therapeutic approach in age-related cognitive impairment.",Excluded

4536,"Research progress on mechanism and dosimetry of brainstem injury induced by intensity-modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy, and heavy ion radiotherapy Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective method for treating head and neck cancer (HNC). However, RT may cause side effects during and after treatment. Radiation-induced brainstem injury (BSI) is often neglected due to its low incidence and short survival time and because it is indistinguishable from intracranial tumor progression. It is currently believed that the possible mechanism of radiation-induced BSI includes increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and damage of vascular endothelial cells, neurons, and glial cells as well as an inflammatory response and oxidative stress. At present, it is still difficult to avoid BSI even with several advanced RT techniques. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is the most commonly used therapeutic technique in the field of RT. Compared with early conformal therapy, it has greatly reduced the injury to normal tissues. Proton beam radiotherapy (PBT) and heavy ion radiotherapy (HIT) have good dose distribution due to the presence of a Bragg peak, which not only results in better control of the tumor but also minimizes the dose to the surrounding normal tissues. There are many clinical studies on BSI caused by IMRT, PBT, and HIT.

3658,"Correlation between the Voice Handicap and Swallowing Quality of Life in patients with laryngeal cancer submitted to chemoradiotherapy Purpose To verify the correlation between the voice handicap and swallowing quality of life in individuals submitted to chemoradiotherapy for laryngeal cancer treatment. Methods Cross-sectional, observational and quantitative study. Fourteen male individuals diagnosed with laryngeal cancer were submitted to exclusive chemoradiotherapy treatment. The individuals completed the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and the Swallowing Quality of Life (SWAL-QOL) questionnaires. Data were submitted to descriptive and inferential analysis using Spearman's Correlation Test to verify possible correlations among the scores of these instruments. Values of p <= 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results No significant correlation was found between the total VHI and overall SWAL-QOL scores. However, there was significant correlation between the domain Functional of the VHI and the domains Fatigue and Social of the SWAL-QOL, between the domain Organic in the VHI and the SWAL-QOL domain Social, and total VHI score and SWAL-QOL domain Swallowing as a burden. Furthermore, chemoradiotherapy treatment had a greater impact on the voice than on the swallowing for the studied individuals. Conclusion The data showed a significant correlation between voice handicap and the impact of quality of life involving swallowing in individuals with laryngeal cancer submitted to chemoradiotherapy. This may affect individuals' emotional and social aspects, impacting their overall quality of life.",Excluded
4763,"The inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced neuronal apoptosis via AMPKalpha1 signaling-mediated autophagy Due to an increasing concern about radiation-induced cognitive deficits for brain tumor patients receiving radiation therapy, developing and evaluating countermeasures has become inevitable. Our previous study has found that minocycline, a clinical available antibiotics that can easily cross the blood brain barrier, mitigates radiation-induced long-term memory loss in rats, accompanied by decreased hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Thus, in the present study, we report an unknown mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of minocycline. We demonstrated that minocycline prevented primary neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis and promoted radiation-induced autophagy in vitro. Moreover, using an immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line, HT22 cells, we found that the protective effect of minocycline on irradiated HT22 cells was not related to DNA damage repair since minocycline did not facilitate DNA DSB repair in irradiated HT22 cells. Further investigation showed that minocycline significantly enhanced X-irradiation-induced AMPKalpha1 activation and autophagy, thus resulting in decreased apoptosis. Additionally, although the antioxidant potential of minocycline might contribute to its apoptosis-inhibitory effect, it was not involved in its enhancive effect on radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy. Taken together, we have revealed a novel mechanism for the protective effect of minocycline on irradiated neurons, e.g. minocycline protects neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis via enhancing radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy.",Included

Expert listeners rated voice and speech quality (based on Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain), articulation (overall, [p], [t], [k]), and comparative mean opinion scores of voice and speech at three assessment points calculated. A structured study-specific questionnaire evaluated patients' perception pretreatment (N=55), at 10-week (N=49) and 1-year posttreatment (N=37).RESULTS: At 10 weeks, perceptual voice quality is significantly affected. The parameters overall voice quality (mean, -0.24; P=0.008), strain (mean, -0.12; P=0.012), nasality (mean, -0.08; P=0.009), roughness (mean, -0.22; P=0.001), and pitch (mean, -0.03; P=0.041) improved over time but not beyond baseline levels, except for asthenia at 1-year posttreatment (voice is less asthenic than at baseline; mean, +0.20; P=0.03). Perceptual analyses of articulation showed no significant differences. Patients judge their voice quality as good (score, 18/20) at all assessment points, but at 1-year posttreatment, most of them (70%) judge their ""voice not as it used to be."" In the 1-year versus 10-week posttreatment comparison, the larynx-hypopharynx tumor group was more strained, whereas nonlarynx tumor voices were judged less strained (mean, -0.33 and +0.07, respectively; P=0.031). Patients' perceived changes in voice and speech quality at 10-week post- versus pretreatment correlate weakly with expert judgments.CONCLUSION: Overall, perceptual CCRT effects on voice and speech seem to peak at 10-week posttreatment but level off at 1-year posttreatment. However, at that assessment point, most patients still perceive their voice as different from baseline.",Excluded

Mean age of the persons was 41. Vegetative dystonia syndrome was diagnosticated in 50% of examined subjects. The increased perception and pain thresholds, as well as the thresholds' asymmetry were determined in 30% of patients. The conduction velocity of sensory and motor nerves, as well as the neuromuscular transmission were normal. No substantial changes in parameters of the soleus H- and M-responses were detected. A decreased amplitude and increased latency of the evoked skin sympathetic potential were found indicating a decreased tone of the adrenergic sympathetic vasoconstrictors and cholinergic sudomotor fibres, that may be one of the pathogenic mechanisms of the sensory, vegetotrophovascular disorders for these subjects. Decreased activity of the sympathetic autonomic system causes permanent course of the vegetative dystonia syndrome and more seldom the parasympathetic autonomic paroxysms. A decreased tone of the sympathetic autonomic system may be due to the monoaminergic neuromediation inhibition (decreased noradrenaline and dopamine excretion for the same subjects), that can induce psychoemotional disorders, depression and sleep-wakeness cycle disorders.",Included
4465,"Sex differences in neurochemical effects of dopaminergic drugs in rat striatum Previous data indicate that dopamine neurotransmission is differently regulated in male and female rats. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the dopamine transporter and autoreceptor as potential loci responsible for this sex difference. Fast cyclic voltammetry at carbon-fiber microelectrodes was used to monitor changes in electrically evoked levels of extracellular dopamine in the striata of anesthetized male and female rats before and after administration of an uptake inhibitor, a dopamine D2 antagonist, or a D3/D2 agonist. Administration of 40 mg/kg cocaine ip increased electrically-evoked extracellular dopamine concentrations in both sexes, but to a significantly greater extent in female striatum at the higher stimulation frequencies. The typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, increased dopamine efflux in both sexes but the effect was twice as large in the female striatum. The D3/D2 agonist quinpirole induced an unexpected, transient increase in dopamine efflux following high-frequency stimulation only in females, and evoked dopamine was higher in females across this entire time course. More detailed analysis of cocaine effects revealed no fundamental sex differences in the interaction of cocaine with DAT in vivo or in synaptosomes. These results indicate that nigrostriatal dopamine neurotransmission in the female rat is more tightly regulated by autoreceptor and transporter mechanisms, perhaps related by greater autoreceptor control of DAT activity. Thus, baseline sex differences in striatal dopamine regulation induce different pharmacologic responses. These results contribute to understanding sex differences in stimulant-induced locomotor activity in rats and may have broader implications for neurologic disorders and their pharmacotherapies in humans.",Excluded

4722,"Alterations in uptake and release rates for GABA, glutamate, and glutamine during biochemical maturation of highly purified cultures of cerebral cortical neurons, a GABAergic preparation This study demonstrates that virtually homogenous cultures of mouse cerebral neurons, obtained from 15-day-old embryos, differentiate at least as well as cultures which in addition contain astrocytes. This was indicated by glutamate decarboxylase activity which within 2 weeks rose from a negligible value to twice the level in the adult mouse cerebral cortex, and by a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake rate which quadrupled during the second week in culture and reached higher values than in brain slices. Within the same period, the GABA content increased four to five times to 75 nmol/mg protein, and a potassium-induced increase in [<sup>14</sup>C]GABA efflux became apparent. Although the development was faster than in vivo, optimum differentiation required maintenance of the cultures beyong the age of 1 week. Uptake and release rates for glutamate and glutamine underwent much less developmental alteration. At no time was there any potassium-induced release of radioactivity after exposure to [<sup>14</sup>C]glutamate, and the glutamate uptake was only slightly increased during the period of GABAergic development. This indicates that exogenous glutamate is not an important GABA precursor. Similarly, glutamine uptake was unaltered between days 7 and 14, although a small potassium-induced release of radioactivity after loading with glutamine suggests a partial conversion to GABA.",Excluded
4776,"Three-dimensional conformal planning using low-segment multi-criteria optimization for hippocampal avoidance whole brain radiotherapy Objective: Hippocampus avoidance whole brain radiotherapy (HA-WBRT) has been shown to reduce the risk of neurocognitive dysfunction. This type of treatment has the potential of insurance company payment denial due to increased cost of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), while the accepted modality for WBRT is three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). The purpose of this study is to assess 3DCRT HA-WBRT treatment plans using multi-criteria optimization (MCO) to meet RTOG 0933 criteria. Method(s): Ten patients with brain metastases were selected, and HA-WBRT treatment plans with MCO 3DCRT technique (MCO-3D) were generated. MCO-3D plans were compared with plans using MCO IMRT techniques (MCO-IMRT). Evaluation parameters included D<inf>98 %</inf> and D<inf>2 %</inf> of PTV, dose homogeneity index, and D<inf>max</inf> and D<inf>100 %</inf> of the hippocampi.

3703,"DELTApH, H<sup>+</sup> diffusion potentials, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATPase in neurosecretory vesicles isolated from bovine neurohypophyses The proton gradient (DELTApH) and electrical potential (DELTApsi) across the neurosecretory vesicles were measured using the optical probes 9-aminoacridine and Oxanol VI, respectively. The addition of neurosecretory vesicles to 9-aminoacridine resulted in a rapid quenching of the dye fluorescence which was reversed when the DELTApH was collapsed with ammonium chloride or K<sup>+</sup> in the presence of nigericin. From fluorescence quenching data and the intravesicular volume, DELTApH across the membrane was calculated. Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATP caused a marked carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-sensitive change in the membrane potential measured using Oxanol VI (plus 100 mV inside positive), presumably due to H<sup>+</sup> translocation across the neurosecretory vesicle membrane. Imposition of this membrane potential was responsible for the lysis of vesicles in the presence of permeant anions. The effectiveness of these anions to support lysis reflected the relative permeability of the anion which followed the order acetate > I<sup>-</sup> > Cl > F<sup>-</sup> > SO<inf>4</inf><sup>-</sup> = isethionate = methyl sulfate. These data showed that the neurosecretory vesicles possess a membrane H<sup>+</sup>-translocating system and prompted the study of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ATPase activities in the vesicle fractions. In intact vesicles a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATPase appeared to be coupled to electrogenic proton translocation, since the enzyme activity was enhanced by uncoupling the electrical potential, using proton ionophores. Inhibition of this enzyme with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide also inhibited the carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-sensitive DELTApsi across the vesicle membrane caused by H<sup>+</sup> translocation. A second Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATPase was also found on the vesicle membranes which is sensitive to vanadate. Complete inhibition of this enzyme with vanadate had little effect on the proton ionophore-uncoupled ATPase activity or on the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATP-induced membrane potential change.",Excluded

The rate of change in tumor blood volume in response to radiation therapy was evaluated with DSC MRI and SPECT. The rate of change in tumor volume in response to radiation was also measured.RESULTS: Ten patients were successfully studied. The rate of change in tumor blood volume correlated well between DSC MRI and SPECT. There was no significant correlation between the rates of change for tumor blood volume and tumor volume. Changes in tumor vascularity preceded the reduction in tumor volume seen following radiotherapy.CONCLUSION: DSC MRI provides information regarding radiation effects on tumor vessels that is not available with conventional MRI.",Excluded

Current guidelines recommend 5-hydroxytryptamine<inf>3</inf> receptor antagonists (5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs) for prophylaxis of RINV for moderate and highly emetogenic radiotherapy; however, certain patients may suffer from RINV despite prophylaxis. Objective(s): To determine if switching 5-HT<inf>3</inf> RAs is successful in the treatment and further prophylaxis of RINV. Method(s): This report details the case of a 47-year-old female with extensive bony involvement to the spine from breast cancer presenting with lower back pain. To palliate her symptoms, the patient underwent a course of irradiation to the lumbar spine and was prescribed ondansetron as an antiemetic. However, the patient experienced severe nausea and emesis and was subsequently switched to granisetron and aprepitant. Result(s): The patient completed the remainder of the radiation treatment with no further emesis and minimal nausea, representing the first documented success of granisetron and aprepitant for RINV after failure on ondansetron.

3925,"Gamma irradiation inhibits neointimal hyperplasia in rats after arterial injury BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Restenosis complicates a significant proportion of endovascular and open vascular procedures such as carotid endarterectomy. In contrast to the primary atheroma, restenosis is characterized by intimal hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells. We hypothesized that gamma radiation would reduce restenosis by limiting intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury.METHODS: To demonstrate the effect of gamma radiation on smooth muscle hyperplasia in vivo, a standardized bilateral carotid balloon catheter arterial injury was produced in 37 rats. A single dose of 750, 1500, or 2250 cGy (1cGy = 1 rad) gamma radiation was delivered to the right carotid artery at either 1 or 2 days after injury; the shielded contralateral carotid artery served as matched control. At 21 days after injury, vessels were perfusion-fixed in situ, and cross-sectional area of neointima was determined from axial sections using image analysis.RESULTS: Marked reductions in neointimal cross-sectional area were demonstrated in vessels subjected to 1500- and 2250-cGy radiation at both 1 and 2 days after injury. A less prominent effect was noted for 750 cGy, reaching statistical significance only at 2 days after injury. By two-way ANOVA, radiation dose (P = .0002), timing of radiation delivery (P = .003), and an interaction between timing and dose (P = .0278) were significantly associated with reduction in neointimal cross-sectional area. At 1500 cGy, delivery of radiation 1 day after injury inhibited neointimal hyperplasia more prominently than the same dose 2 days after injury; a dose-response relation was evident at 1 day.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation may be an important adjunctive therapy for reducing the incidence of restenosis after angioplasty or endarterectomy.",Included
4475,"Differential expression of KCC2 accounts for the differential GABA responses between relay and intrinsic neurons in the early postnatal rat olfactory bulb The rat olfactory bulb is anatomically immature at birth, and considerable neurogenesis and synaptogenesis are known to take place postnatally. In addition, significant physiological changes have also been reported in this period. For example, granule cell-mediated inhibition following electrical stimulations to the lateral olfactory tract is robust during the first postnatal week, and then decreases abruptly after the second week. However, the mechanism underlying this enhanced inhibition remains to be elucidated. To know the cause of this phenomenon, we investigated the expression patterns of cation-Cl(-) co-transporters (KCC1, KCC2 and NKCC1) mRNAs, which are responsible for the regulation of [Cl(-)](i). In addition, responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were measured by gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp recordings and Ca(2+) imaging using fura-2. We found that in the early postnatal period, mitral cells expressing KCC2 mRNA were inhibited by GABA, while granule cells lacking KCC2 mRNA expression were depolarized or excited by GABA. These results indicate that transient GABA-mediated excitation on granule cells might be the main cause of the enhanced inhibition on mitral cells, and suggest that these differential GABA responses between relay and intrinsic neurons play pivotal roles in the early postnatal rat olfactory bulb.",Excluded

Other populations with similar reduced responses have shown improved immunogenicity to a high-dose vaccine. OBJECTIVE(S): A pilot prospective cohort study was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity of the Fluzone High-Dose influenza vaccine in patients with CNS malignancy. METHOD(S): Baseline data on diagnosis, chemotherapy, radiation, glucocorticoids, and timing of treatment were collected. All patients underwent vaccination with of the Fluzone High-Dose influenza vaccine. Serum samples are actively being collected at baseline, day 28, and 3 months following vaccine administration. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers will be measured to determine seroconversion (4-fold rise) and seroprotection (titer 1:40). RESULT(S): A total of 27 patients were enrolled. Mean age at baseline was 52.7 years (+/-12.6);41% male; 93% white and 7% black. Diagnoses included high-grade glioma (85%), CNS lymphoma (11%), and meningioma (4%). At enrollment, 8 patients (30%) were taking glucocorticoids, 4 (15%) were undergoing active radiation, 14 (52%) were on chemotherapy, and 5 (19%) began chemotherapy following vaccine administration. Prior radiation (n = 19, 70%) and chemotherapy (n = 14, 52%) were common. Seven patients (26%) reported post-vaccination symptoms potentially attributable to vaccination; 6 experienced only local soreness or redness at the injection site and 1 suffered headache, nausea, vomiting.

4795,"Postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery for resected brain metastases: A comparison of outcomes for large resection cavities PURPOSE: Although historical trials have established the role of surgical resection followed by whole brain irradiation (WBRT) for brain metastases, WBRT has recently been shown to cause significant neurocognitive decline. Many practitioners have employed postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to tumor resection cavities to increase local control without causing significant neurocognitive sequelae. However, studies analyzing outcomes of large brain metastases treated with resection and postoperative SRS are lacking. Here we compare outcomes in patients with large brain metastases >4 cm to those with smaller metastases <=4 cm treated with surgical resection followed by SRS to the resection cavity.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Consecutive patients with brain metastases treated at our institution with surgical resection and postoperative SRS were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified into <=4 cm and >4 cm cohorts based on preoperative maximal tumor dimension. Cumulative incidence of local failure, radiation necrosis, and death were analyzed for the 2 cohorts using a competing-risk model, defined as the time from SRS treatment date to the measured event, death, or last follow-up.RESULTS: A total of 117 consecutive cases were identified. Of these patients, 90 (77%) had preoperative tumors <=4 cm, and 27 (23%) >4 cm in greatest dimension. The only significant baseline difference between the 2 groups was a higher proportion of patients who underwent gross total resection in the <=4 cm compared with the >4 cm cohort, 76% versus 48%, respectively (P <.01). The 1-year rates of local failure, radiation necrosis, and overall survival for the <=4 cm and >4 cm cohorts were 12.3% and 16.0%, 26.9% and 28.4%, and 80.6% and 67.6%, respectively (all P >.05). The rates of local failure and radiation necrosis were not statistically different on multivariable analysis based on tumor size.CONCLUSIONS: Brain metastases >4 cm in largest dimension managed by resection and radiosurgery to the tumor cavity have promising local control rates without a significant increase in radiation necrosis on our retrospective review.",Excluded
3682,"Safety of radiosurgery applied to conditions with abnormal tumor suppressor genes OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of radiosurgery inducing malignancy in neurofibromatosis-2 (NF2) and von Hippel-Lindau disease.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 118 NF2 and 19 von Hippel-Lindau disease patients, totalling 906 and 62 patient-years of follow-up data, respectively.RESULTS: Two cases of intracranial malignancy were identified, both of which occurred in NF2 patients. One of these was thought to have arisen before the radiosurgery; the other was a glioblastoma diagnosed 3 years after radiosurgery.CONCLUSION: Because gliomas may occur in as many as 4% of NF2 patients, this may not represent an increased risk. We continue to offer radiosurgery treatment to selected NF2 and von Hippel-Lindau disease patients and consider that the late risk of malignancy arising after irradiation must be put in the context of the condition being treated, the treatment options available to these individuals, and their life expectancy.",Excluded

In order to predict the hourly maximum ozone one day in advance based on the meteorological variables for the Wanqingsha site in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, a neural network model (Multi-Layer Perceptron) and a multiple linear regression model were used and compared. Model inputs are meteorological parameters (wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure and solar radiation) of the next day and hourly maximum ozone concentration of the previous day. The OBS (optimal brain surgeon) was adopted to prune the neutral work, to reduce its complexity and to improve its generalization ability. We find that the pruned neural network has the capacity to predict the peak ozone, with an agreement index of 92.3%, the root mean square error of 0.0428 mg/m3, the R-square of 0.737 and the success index of threshold exceedance 77.0% (the threshold O3 mixing ratio of 0.20 mg/m3). When the neural classifier was added to the neural network model, the success index of threshold exceedance increased to 83.6%. Through comparison of the performance indices between the multiple linear regression model and the neural network model, we conclud that that neural network is a better choice to predict peak ozone from meteorological forecast, which may be applied to practical prediction of ozone concentration.",Excluded

4153,"Mechanisms of caspase-1 mediated schwannoma regression Schwannoma tumors are composed of Schwann-lineage cells and form along peripheral, spinal and cranial nerves. These tumors can cause pain, sensory/motor dysfunction, and death through compression of peripheral nerves, the spinal cord, and/or the brain stem. We have previously shown gene therapy for these tumors using a xenograft model in which immortalized human schwannoma cells (HEI-193) expressing a fluorescent protein and luciferase are implanted in the sciatic nerve of nude mice. Our strategy has been to express the apoptotic protein, caspase-1 (ICE, IL1-converting enzyme) under the P0 promoter, selectively active in Schwann cells during development, using an adeno-associated vector 1 (AAV1) injected directly into the tumors. Caspase-3 is the most common pro-apoptotic target for therapeutic modulation. However, unlike caspase-3, caspase-1 has a strong pro-inflammatory component in addition to induction of apoptosis. Caspase-1 activates pro-IL-1b and pro-IL-18, which in turn trigger immune responses mediated by neutrophils and monocytes, or NK cells; it has been associated with both innate and adaptive immunity. In addition, caspase-1 is activated by several chemotherapeutic drugs and can sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation. Our recent data indicate that AAV1- P0-ICE not only induces apoptosis of infected caspase-1-expressing HEI-193 schwannoma cells, but also kills non-infected tumor cells through a bystander effect mediated by both tumor- and host-specific mechanisms. Supernatants derived from HEI-193 cells transfected with AAV1-P0-ICE DNA kill non-transfected tumor cells in vitro. Similarly, peripheral nerve implantation of a 1:1 mixture of AAV-P0- ICE DNA-transfected and non-transfected HEI-193 cells prevented tumor growth. This bystander killing effect induced by AAV1-P0-ICE was also observed when established intra-sciatic HEI-193 tumors were injected with AAV1-P0-ICE transfected cells. Interestingly, intra-sciatic implantation of HEI-193 cells 2 weeks after injection at the same location of AAV1-P0-ICE DNA-transfected cells, i.e. long after all of the originally implanted caspase-1expressing HEI-193 cells should be dead, also prevents formation of a tumor. These data suggest that caspase-1-induced death of HEI-193 cells in vivo leads to local changes in the region of the tumor capable of preventing formation of a subsequent tumor. This investigation of AAV1-P0-ICE induced bystander killing of tumor cells has the potential to generate new therapeutics for the neurofibromatoses, as well as, for other benign neoplasms. Not only can caspase-1 induce apoptosis, but the resulting tumor killing and associated activation of host immune responses may generate a vaccination effect that could control the development and growth of subsequent schwannomas.",Excluded

The aim of the present study was to make an appropriate exposure assessment of RF welding and examine the health status of the operators. In total, 35 RF operators and 37 controls were included. The leakage fields (electric and magnetic field strength) were measured, as well as induced and contact current. Information about welding time and productivity was used to calculate time integrated exposure. A neurophysiological examination and 24 h ECG were also carried out. The participants also had to answer a questionnaire about subjective symptoms. The measurements showed that RF operators were exposed to rather intense electric and magnetic fields. The mean values of the calculated 6 min, spatially averaged E and H field strengths, in line with ICNIRP reference levels, are 107 V/m and 0.24 A/m, respectively. The maximum measured field strengths were 2 kV/m and 1.5 A/m, respectively. The induced current in ankles and wrists varied, depending on the work situation, with a mean value of 101 mA and a maximum measured value of 1 A. In total, 11 out of 46 measured RF plastic sealers exceeded the ICNIRP reference levels. RF operators, especially the ready made clothing workers had a slightly disturbed two-point discrimination ability compared to a control group. A nonsignificant difference between RF operators and controls was found in the prevalence of subjective symptoms, but the time integrated exposure parameters seem to be of importance to the prevalence of some subjective symptoms: fatigue, headaches, and warmth sensations in the hands. Further, RF operators had a significantly lower heart rate (24 h registration) and more episodes of bradycardia compared to controls.",Excluded
4804,"Targeting the NF-E2-related factor 2 pathway: A novel strategy for glioblastoma (Review) Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant subtype among all brain tumors. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an essential component of cellular defense against a variety of endogenous and exogenous stresses. A marked increase in research over the past few decades focusing on Nrf2 and its role in regulating glioblastoma has revealed the potential value of Nrf2 in the treatment of glioblastoma. In the present review, we discuss a novel framework of Nrf2 in the regulation of glioblastoma and the mechanisms regarding the downregulation of Nrf2 in treating glioblastoma. The candidate mechanisms include direct and indirect means. Direct mechanisms target tumor molecular pathways in order to overcome resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, to inhibit proliferation, to block invasion and migration, to induce apoptosis, to promote differentiation, to enhance autophagy and to target glioblastoma stem cells. Indirect mechanisms target the reaction between glioblastoma cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Overall, the value of the Nrf2 pathway in glioblastoma provides a promising opportunity for new approaches by which to treat glioblastoma.",Excluded

4511,"3D conditional generative adversarial networks for high-quality PET image estimation at low dose Positron emission tomography (PET) is a widely used imaging modality, providing insight into both the biochemical and physiological processes of human body. Usually, a full dose radioactive tracer is required to obtain high-quality PET images for clinical needs. This inevitably raises concerns about potential health hazards. On the other hand, dose reduction may cause the increased noise in the reconstructed PET images, which impacts the image quality to a certain extent. In this paper, in order to reduce the radiation exposure while maintaining the high quality of PET images, we propose a novel method based on 3D conditional generative adversarial networks (3D c-GANs) to estimate the high-quality full-dose PET images from low-dose ones. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) include a generator network and a discriminator network which are trained simultaneously with the goal of one beating the other. Similar to GANs, in the proposed 3D c-GANs, we condition the model on an input low-dose PET image and generate a corresponding output full-dose PET image. Specifically, to render the same underlying information between the low-dose and full-dose PET images, a 3D U-net-like deep architecture which can combine hierarchical features by using skip connection is designed as the generator network to synthesize the full-dose image. In order to guarantee the synthesized PET image to be close to the real one, we take into account of the estimation error loss in addition to the discriminator feedback to train the generator network. Furthermore, a concatenated 3D c-GANs based progressive refinement scheme is also proposed to further improve the quality of estimated images. Validation was done on a real human brain dataset including both the normal subjects and the subjects diagnosed as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Experimental results show that our proposed 3D c-GANs method outperforms the benchmark methods and achieves much better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative measures.",Excluded

It is not clear how translation of Rh1 is regulated. Here, we show that adult photoreceptors maintain a constant, abundant quantity of ninaE mRNA, which encodes Rh1. We demonstrate that the Fmr1 protein associates with ninaE mRNA and represses its translation. Further, light exposure triggers a calcium-dependent dephosphorylation of Fmr1, which relieves suppression of Rh1 translation. We demonstrate that Mts, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), mediates light-induced Fmr1 dephosphorylation in a regulatory B subunit of PP2A (CKa)-dependent manner. Finally, we show that blocking light-induced Rh1 translation results in reduced light sensitivity.

4437,"Increased expression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein in limbic brain regions after amygdala-kindled seizures in rats Increased expression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp; ABCB1) has previously been found in epileptogenic brain tissue from patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) as well as in the hippocampus and other limbic brain regions in the rat kainate model of TLE. Approaches to the quantification of Pgp expression have mainly been based on subjective visual estimation of the level of Pgp immunoreactivity in brain sections. In the present study, computer-assisted image analysis based on optical density (OD) measurements was used to examine immunohistochemical expression of Pgp in the kindling model of TLE. Sections from kainate-treated rats were used for comparison. Using diaminobenzidine as chromogen, Pgp was exclusively located in brain capillary endothelial cells, which was confirmed by double-labeling with an antibody against the endothelial glucose transporter (GLUT-1). After kainate-induced seizures, the intensity of endothelial Pgp staining significantly increased by 70-80% in the dentate gyrus. A significant, albeit less marked increase in Pgp expression in this area was also seen after amygdala-kindled seizures. Furthermore, Pgp was upregulated after kindling in the hilus of the dentate gyrus, the CA1 and CA3 sectors of the hippocampus, and the piriform and cerebral cortex. In kindled rats, most Pgp alterations occurred ipsilateral to the electrode in the basolateral amygdala. The data demonstrate that computer-assisted image analysis using OD is an accurate and rapid method to determine the relative amount of Pgp protein in brain sections and the effects of seizures on this multidrug transporter. The fact that Pgp overexpression in brain capillary endothelial cells occurs in two established models of difficult-to-treat TLE substantiates the notion that seizure-induced upregulation of Pgp contributes to multidrug resistance (MDR) in epilepsy.",Excluded

At the completion of therapy, 92% of treated patients experienced pain relief and 67% had significant to complete improvement on neurologic examination. Thirty days after treatment, repeat myelography was performed in 40 of the 50 cases; compared with the initial findings immediately preceding radiation therapy (RT), the results of 58% of these studies had normalized completely, results were improved in 25%, and the results had not changed in 18%. The presence of a high-grade compression fracture of the vertebral body was an indicator of poor prognosis for tumor response on repeat myelography. The ability of a patient to walk before treatment and tumor response on repeat myelography were associated significantly with improved outcome of RT and with survival.

A major concern is to avoid causing new deficits. As conventional MR imaging does not delineate the optic radiation, the risk to vision from surgery cannot be predicted, nor can surgery be tailored to minimise the risk. Methods Conventional structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging were acquired in 13 patients with medically refractory epilepsy due a lesion near the optic radiation and undergoing pre-surgical evaluation at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. The optic radiation was delineated and visualised in relation to the lesions on anatomical images and in 3D reconstructions. Pre- and post-operative visual fields were acquired by Goldmann perimetry. Results The relationship between the epileptogenic lesion and the optic radiation was demonstrated in each patient provididing helpful additional information in deciding whether to proceed with surgery, and in planning the surgical procedure and approach. Prseoperative and postoperative imaging findings correlated with the visual field data.

In vivo imaging of these receptors with selective 5HT4R radiotracers and PET would be valuable to investigate alterations in 5HT4R in different brain disorders and to assist drug discovery. In this study, (18)F-MNI698 was evaluated as a potential PET radiotracer for imaging of 5HT4R in the brain.METHODS: Eighteen PET studies were performed in 3 adult rhesus monkeys. The radiotracer was administered as a bolus intravenous injection or bolus plus constant infusion (time that would be required to inject the bolus at the infusion rate = 60 min), and arterial blood was collected for data quantification. Kinetic models were used to estimate distribution volumes and binding potentials, for which the cerebellum was used as a reference region. (18)F-MNI698 test-retest variability and upper mass dose limits were determined. Preblocking studies using several doses of SB204070, a selective 5HT4R antagonist, were performed.RESULTS: (18)F-MNI698 avidly entered the monkey brain (peak percentage injected dose of ~ 6.6%), and its brain distribution was consistent with known 5HT4R densities. At 120 min after bolus injection and after the start of radiotracer infusion, only less than 5% and approximately 10% parent compound was present in blood, respectively. Measured binding potentials were underestimated by 22%-36% when noninvasive methods were used for data quantification in comparison with invasive methods. A good agreement was found between test-retest measurements. The radiotracer upper mass dose limit (<5% occupancy) was determined to be 13.1 mug per 70 kg of body weight.

The study's outcome measures were technical success, adverse events and radiation exposure.RESULTS: In total, four patients completed the four loading doses, whilst the fifth patient received only one loading dose; two patients also received their first maintenance doses. Overall, 20 consecutive transforaminal, intrathecal treatments were analysed. Technical success was 100% (20/20 intrathecal infusions). No adverse events were documented following the procedures. Mean dose-length product (DLP) value per injection was 665.4 +/- 715.5 mGy*cm. Estimated mean effective dose per injection was 12.7 +/- 12.9 mSv. Subgroup analysis between the chronologically first 10 versus subsequent 10 procedures demonstrated a clear trend towards less radiation exposure in the latter, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (DLP: 984.7 +/- 903.3 vs. 436.7 +/- 321.5 mGy*cm, P = 0.165; respectively).CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective series, CT-guided transforaminal access for intrathecal injection of nusinersen was proven feasible and safe. A decrease in radiation dose over time was noted. Protocols to minimize radiation exposure are essential.",Excluded
3890,"Ambient neutron and photon dose equivalent H (10) around a pencil beam scanning proton therapy facility OBJECTIVES: To measure leakage ambient dose equivalent H*(10) from stray secondary neutron and photon radiation around proton therapy (PT) facility and evaluate adequacy of shielding design.METHODS AND MATERIALS: H*(10) measurement were carried out at 149 locations around cyclotron vault (CV), beam transport system (BTS) and first treatment room (GTR3) of a multiroom PT facility using WENDI-II and SmartIon survey meter. Measurement were performed under extreme case scenarios wherein maximum secondary neutrons and photons were produced around CV, BTS and GTR3 by stopping 230MeV proton of 300nA on beam degrader, end of BTS and isocenter of GTR3. Weekly time average dose rate (TADR) were calculated from H*(10) value measured at selective hot spots by irradiating actual treatment plans of mix clinical sites.RESULTS: The maximum total H*(10) were within 2 microSv/hr around CV, 5 microSv/hr around outer wall of BTS which increases up to 62 microSv/hr at the end of inside BTS corridor. Maximum H*(10) of 20.8 microSv/hr in treatment control console (P125), 23.4 microSv/hr behind the common wall between GTR3 and GTR2 (P132) and 25.7 microSv/hr above isocenter (P99) were observed around GTR3. Reduction of beam current from 6 to 3 nA and 1 nA at nozzle exit lead to decrease in total H*(10) at P125 from 20.8 to 11.35 and 4.62 microSv/hr. In comparison to extreme case scenario, H*(10) value at P125, P132 and P99 from clinically relevant irradiation parameters were reduce by a factor ranging from 8.6 for high range cube to 46.4 for brain clinical plan. The maximum weekly TADR per fraction was highest for large volume, sacral chordoma patient at 8.5 microSv/hr compare to 0.3 microSv/hr for brain patient. The calculated weekly TADR for 30 mix clinical cases and 15 fractions of 1 L cube resulted total weekly TADR of 83-84 microSv/hr at P125, P132 and P99. The maximum annual dose level at these hot spots were estimated at 4.37 mSv/Yr.CONCLUSION: We have carried out an extensive measurement of H*(10) under different conditions. The shielding thickness of our PT facility is adequate to limit the dose to occupational worker and general public within the permissible stipulated limit. The data reported here can bridge the knowledge gap in ambient dose around PT facility and can also be used as a reference for any new and existing proton facility for intercomparison and validation.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: First extensive investigation of neutron and photon H*(10) around PT facility and can bridge the knowledge gap on ambient dose.",Excluded
4490,"EUS-guided celiac ganglion irradiation with iodine-125 seeds for pain control in pancreatic carcinoma: a prospective pilot study BACKGROUND: Celiac plexus neurolysis for the palliative reduction of pain in unresectable pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is safe but provides limited relief. In a previous study, we found that EUS-guided implantation of iodine-125 ((125)I) around the celiac ganglia is a safe procedure and can induce apoptosis of local neurons in a porcine model.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of direct celiac ganglion irradiation with (125)I seeds for the relief of moderate to severe pain secondary to unresectable PC.DESIGN: Prospective study.SETTING: Single, tertiary care referral center.PATIENTS: This study enrolled consecutive patients who had moderate to severe pain resulting from biopsy-proven unresectable PC.INTERVENTION: All patients underwent EUS-guided direct celiac ganglion irradiation with (125)I seeds. Follow-up was conducted at least once weekly until death.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Blood parameters, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, mean analgesic (MS Contin [morphine sulfate]) consumption, and complications were evaluated during follow-up.RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with unresectable PC underwent the procedure. The mean number of seeds implanted in the celiac ganglion per patient was 4 (range 2-6). Immediately after the procedure, pain relief and analgesic consumption showed no significant changes compared with preoperative values. Six patients (26%) reported pain exacerbation. Two weeks later, the VAS score and mean analgesic consumption were significantly less than preoperative values. No procedure-related deaths or major complications occurred.LIMITATIONS: Uncontrolled study.CONCLUSIONS: EUS-guided direct celiac ganglion irradiation with (125)I seeds can reduce the VAS score and analgesic drug consumption in patients with unresectable PC.",Excluded
3762,"Pseudoprogression following chemoradiotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme PURPOSE: Pseudoprogression (psPD) is now recognised following radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide (RT/TMZ) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of psPD following RT/TMZ and the effect of psPD on prognosis.MATERIALS/METHODS: All patients receiving RT/TMZ for newly diagnosed GBM were identified from a prospective database. Clinical and radiographic data were retrospectively reviewed. Early progression was defined as radiological progression (RECIST criteria) during or within eight weeks of completing RT/TMZ. Pseudoprogression was defined as early progression with subsequent disease stabilization, without salvage therapy, for at least six months from completion of RT/TMZ. The primary outcome was overall survival (Kaplan-Meier) and log rank analysis was used to compare groups.RESULTS: Out of 111 patients analyzed, 104 were evaluable for radiological response. Median age was 58 years and median follow-up 55 weeks. Early progression was confirmed in 26% and within this group 32% had psPD. Median survival for the whole cohort was 56.7 weeks [95% CI (51.0, 71.3)]. Median survival for patients with psPD was significantly higher than for patients with true early progression (124.9 weeks versus 36.0 weeks, p = 0.0286).CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one third of patients with early progression were found to have psPD which was associated with a favourable prognosis. Maintenance TMZ should not be abandoned on the basis of seemingly discouraging imaging features identified within the first three months after RT/TMZ.",Excluded
4304,"Biologically effective dose and prediction of obliteration of unruptured arteriovenous malformations treated by upfront Gamma Knife radiosurgery: A series of 149 consecutive cases OBJECTIVE Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) present no pathologic tissue, and radiation dose is confined in a clear targeted volume. The authors retrospectively evaluated the role of the biologically effective dose (BED) after Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for brain AVMs. METHODS A total of 149 consecutive cases of unruptured AVMs treated by upfront GKRS in Lille University Hospital, France, were included. The mean length of follow-up was 52.9 months (median 48, range 12-154 months). The primary outcome was obliteration, and the secondary outcome was complication appearance. The marginal dose was 24 Gy in a vast majority of cases (n = 115, 77.2%; range 18-25 Gy). The mean BED was 220.1 Gy<inf>2.47</inf> (median 229.9, range 106.7-246.8 Gy<inf>2.47</inf>). The mean beam-on time was 32.3 minutes (median 30.8, range 9-138.7 minutes). In the present series, the mean radiation dose rate was 2.259 Gy/min (median 2.176, range 1.313-3.665 Gy/min). The Virginia score was 0 in 29 (19.5%), 1 in 61 (40.9%), 2 in 41 (27.5%), 3 in 18 (12.1%), and 4 in 0 (0%) patients, respectively. The mean Pollock-Flickinger score was 1.11 (median 1.52, range 0.4-2.9). Univariate (for obliteration and complication appearance) and multivariate (for obliteration only) analyses were performed. RESULTS A total of 104 AVMs (69.8%) were obliterated at the last follow-up. The strongest predictor for obliteration was BED (p = 0.03). A radiosurgical obliteration score is proposed, derived from a fitted multivariable model: (0.018 x BED) + (1.58 x V12) + (-0.013689 x beam-on time) + (0.021 x age) - 4.38. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.7438; after internal validation using bootstrap methods, it was 0.7088. No statistically significant relationship between radiation dose rate and obliteration was found (p = 0.29). Twenty-eight (18.8%) patients developed complications after GKRS; 20 (13.4%) of these patients had transient adverse radiological effects (perilesional edema developed). Predictors for complication appearance were higher prescription isodose volume (p = 0.005) and 12-Gy isodose line volume (V12; p = 0.001), higher Pollock-Flickinger (p = 0.02) and Virginia scores (p = 0.003), and lower beam-on time (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS The BED was the strongest predictor of obliteration of unruptured AVMs after upfront GKRS. A radiosurgical score comprising the BED is proposed. The V12 appears as a predictor for both efficacy and toxicity. Beam-on time was illustrated as statistically significant for both obliteration and complication appearance. The radiation dose rate did not influence obliteration in the current analysis. The exact BED threshold remains to be established by further studies.

4706,"Development of a multipurpose, flexible and scalable data acquisition system for DOI-PET Objectives Depth-of-interaction (DOI) measurement, which reduces the parallax error, is desirable not only for reducing resolution loss at the peripheral region but also for enabling unusual, dedicated detectorarrangement in PET. However practical use of DOI detectors has not been achieved in clinical scanners. In this paper, therefore, we develop a multipurpose, flexible and scalable DOI detector system, and it is used to develop two world's first PET scanners, the OpenPET and the helmet-chin PET. OpenPET, which consists of two axially separated detector rings, is originally proposed for in situ visualization of irradiation field in particle therapy. On the other hand, the helmet-chin PET, in which additional ""chin strap"" detectors assist a hemisphere detector unit, is proposed as the most efficient geometry for brain imaging. Methods For both scanners, the DOI detectors consist of 1024 Zr-doped GSO crystals which are arranged in 4 layers of 16 x 16 arrays, coupled to a 64-ch flat panel PMT. Each crystal element is 2.8 x 2.8 x 7.5 mm<sup>3</sup>. Front-end circuit equipped only resister chain and amplifier and the data acquisition (DAQ) system was separated from the gantry by 15-m coaxial cables for protecting electronics circuits from radiation damage by secondary particles. Also, the DAQ system has no coincidence circuit and only the singles list-mode DAQ circuits. Singles data are multiplexed and stored in a single PC through the optical cable. The assumed maximum data transfer rate of this DAQ system is 100 Mcps. The DAQ system makes a judgment on coincidence based on software. Results For the whole-body OpenPET, count rate performance was measured by the cylinder phantom. This phantom activity was 257 MBq. Measurement time was 60 s at 20 min intervals. Singles data loss was under 8%. Also, calculation time of the coincidence process was less than the measurement time less than 250 MBq. Conclusions We developed the flexible DAQ system and showed that the DAQ system had sufficient performance.",Excluded

3752,"Zinc distribution in various tissues, (brain, eye, skin, muscle and blood) of rat during hindlimb suspension Postural changes in 1-G environment induce well documented haemodynamic changes. On going from Earth's 1-G environment to the microgravity of space a marked cephalic blood volume shift occurs in humans with a subsequent loss of 2-3 L of fluid determined by diuresis and decreased fluid intake. Moreover, a number of transient changes in serum concentrations of sodium, potassium and calium have been observed in astronauts during spaceflight. It is conceivable that changes in the fluid status, and reduced muscle activities, which are changed by the microgravity environment, would also result in redistribution of some trace elements, such as zinc, copper and manganese. In particular, zinc metabolism, directly involved in many physiological processes, can be altered by a wide variety of factors including stress, rest, exercise, hormones and diet. Some of the microgravity-induced responses in space can be simulated in humans by using the posture of head-down tilt, and in rat by using the posture of hindlimb suspension. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of hindlimb suspension for 3-14 days on sodium, potassium and zinc content in various rat tissues including blood, muscle, brain, eye and nose's skin.",Excluded
3951,"Phase II study: Induction chemotherapy & transoral surgery as definitive tx for locally advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC)-A novel approach Background: The standard of care for OPSCC includes chemoradiation (CRT) or surgery with adjuvant radiation (RT). However, RT is associated with significant life long morbidity. We assessed the e fficacy of a two-drug induction regimen, followed by transoral robotic assisted surgery (TORS) & neck dissection for locally advanced OPSCC. Method(s): This is an IRB approved single-arm phase II study for untreated stage III or IVA OPSCC patients (pts) with an ECOG < 2 and GFR > 50 cc. Induction chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and taxotere 75 mg/m2 every 21 days for 3 cycles. Tumor shrinkage was examined after each cycle. If the primary tumor was > 80% smaller, pts underwent TORS and neck dissection(s). At post-op visits, flexible laryngoscopy, blood work, and imaging with PET/CT and/or MRI were done. Short and long term toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated. Result(s): Nineteenpts were treated and 14 are available for analysis. Thirteen were male, 12 were Caucasian, 2 were African-American, and 13 were HPV+. Median age at diagnosis was 57. Tumors involved the tonsil (11 pts) and base of tongue (3 pts). Three pts were stage III, and 11 were stage IVA. Tumor size was reduced on average by 58%, 84% and 92% after the 1st, 2 and 3 induction cycles respectively. Pathologic complete remission of primary disease occurred in 11 pts and in 7 pts with cervical lymph node disease. Four pts were given dose-reduced chemo and one pt was changed to carboplatin per protocol because of renal dysfunction. In addition, adverse events included three patients with grade I fatigue, neuropathy or nausea. Pre vs post tx QOL scores were not significantly different. At a mean follow-up (f/u) of 13 months (range 2.5 to 19.7), 13 pts are alive and well. Three pts recurred, and were treated with salvage CRT. One pt died of metastatic disease. Conclusion(s): Cisplatin + Taxotere is an effective induction tx for OPSCC, Induction tx followed by transoral & neck resections without RT is a promising tx model for OPSCC. It appears effective while avoiding adverse effects of RT. Longer f/u is required to assess its true e fficacy.",Excluded

[Chinese] To compare the dosimetric differences of dosiology between intensity-modulated arc radiotherapy (IMAT) and dynamic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (dIMRT) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. CT data from 25 patients treated in our radiotherapy center were selected randomly for this study. For each patient, the IMAT technique and the fixed beam dIMRT technique were accomplished by the simultaneously integrated boost. Dose volume histogram (DVH) data, isodose distribution, monitor units (MUs) and treatment time were compared in the two techniques. There was no significant difference between the IMAT and the dIMRT in dose received by 95% of target volumes (D(95)) (P>0.05). Overall, the mean dose (D(mean)), maximal dose (D(max)) and volume percentage receiving at least of 107% of the prescribed dose (V(107%)) of planning target volume (PTV) for the IMAT were increased slightly ,compared with the dlMRT (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in dosimetric indices of organs at risk (OARs) including spinal cord,optical nerves,lens and temporomandibular joints in the two techniques (P>0.05). Compared with the dlMRI, the D(max) of brain stem for the IMAT was increased slightly (P<0.05). Similar trends was observed for the D(mean) and dose received by 50% of volume (D(50)) of the left and right parotid glands (P<0.05). Healthy tissue (defined as the volume of the body minus PTV,B-P) irradiated from 800 cGy in the IMAT was higher, and that from 1200-4500 cGy was lower compared with the dlMRI (P<0.05).The average number of MUs was reduced by 62.7% per fraction, and the treatment time was on average reduced by 60.1% per fraction in the IMAT compared with the dlMRI. There is a slight difference in dosiology between the two radiotherapy techniques investigated, but they both meet the clinical requirement. Compared with the dIMRT, the IMAT delivers less irradiation to healthy tissue, uses fewer MUs and takes less time during radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",Excluded
3853,"Phase I trial of escalated doses of targeted marrow/lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) delivered by tomotherapy combined with etoposide and cyclophosphamide; an allogeneic HCT preparative regimen for patients with refractory leukemia Introduction: The overall survival (OS) for relapsed (RL) acute leukemia patients or those considered induction failure (IF) treated with HCT is 16-19% (Duval et al., JCO 2010). While randomized studies have shown a dose response relationship, with higher doses of radiation resulting in decreased relapse, this benefit is off set by increased treatment related mortality. Materials (or patients) and Methods: To explore the safety and tolerability of targeted radiation treatment in the context of HCT, a phase I trial is being conducted in which escalated doses of targeted whole body radiation is delivered to marrow bearing and lymphoid areas, while sparing non hematopoietic (vital) organs. The transplant preparative regimen is as follows: TMLI on days -10 to -6; etoposide 60mg/kg [adj bw] on day -5 with cyclophosphamide 100mg/kg [ideal bw] on day -3. The radiation dose was started at 1200cGy delivered in 150 cGy fractions twice a day. Initially the dose of radiation was escalated in increments of 150 cGy to 1500 cGy using standard 3x3 design and then 100 cGy incrementally to a maximum of 2000 cGy using rolling 6 design. Dose limiting toxicity is defined according to the Bearman and CTCAE 3.0 (for hematologic toxicity) scales. Liver and brain dose was kept at 1200 cGy. Median normal organs received 16-60% of the marrow dose (lung 44%, esophagus 33% and oral cavity 28%). All patients received peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and sirolimus. Result(s): To date, a total of 41 patients have been transplanted; from 3/14/2008 to 10/3/2013. Patient characteristics: AML n=27, ALL Ph- n=10, ALL Ph+ n=2, Biphenotypic n=2; disease status at HCT, 1RL n=13, 2RL n=2, IF n=26; cytogenetic risk(SWOG criteria): intermediate n=19, unfavorable n=15 and unknown significance n=7 median KPS at HCT 90 (60-100); donor source sibling n=20, HLA matched unrelated n=5, mismatched (1 allele) unrelated n=16; WBC at HCT median 1.5 (0.1-14.9) % blasts (blood) at HCT median 2% (0-85%) % blasts (marrow) at HCT median 46% (10-90%) Two patients presented with extramedullary disease at time of HCT. With a median follow-up for alive patients of 9.9 months (1.0- 53.4), the OS and cumulative incidence of relapse/progression at 1 year are 52% (95%CI: 32.9-68.1) and 45% (95%CI: 30.9-65.5) respectively. Two patients are currently being treated at 1900 cGy dose, MTD has not been declared. All patients treated at >= 1700 cGy achieved CR at the day 30 post transplant evaluation. Twenty (49%) of patients developed acute GvHD; 6(30%) of these developed grades 3-4. The day 30 and day 100 NRM was 0% and 5.3% respectively. The most common toxicity across the dose levels tested is grade 1 GI and grade 2 stomatitis (Bearman Scale). Causes of death were disease progression/persistent disease n=14, GvHD n=1 and infection n=1. Discussion(s): These results are encouraging and suggest that 1) doses of TMLI can be safely escalated to 1800 cGy in combination with etoposide and cyclophosphamide (MTD not reached, dose escalation will continue to 2000 cGy); 2) all patients treated with >=1700 cGy achieved a CR at the day 30 evaluation and that 3) a reduction in relapse/progression compared to published reports can be achieved without increasing NRM using targeted whole body radiation in this high risk population.",Excluded
4399,"Feasibility of intracoronary beta-irradiation to reduce restenosis after balloon angioplasty. A clinical pilot study BACKGROUND: With the aim of decreasing the incidence of restenosis after coronary balloon angioplasty, we developed a technique of intracoronary beta-irradiation using an endoluminally centered pure metallic 90Y source. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical feasibility and safety profile of this approach with a dose of 18 Gy delivered to the inner arterial surface.METHODS AND RESULTS: Between June 21 and November 15, 1995, fifteen patients (6 women and 9 men; mean age, 71 +/- 5 years) underwent intracoronary beta-irradiation immediately after a conventional percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedure. The PTCA/irradiation procedure was technically feasible in all attempted cases, and the delivery of the 18 Gy dose was accomplished without complications. In 4 patients, the intervention was completed through intra-arterial stent implantation because of dissection induced by the initial PTCA. During the follow-up period of 178 +/- 17 days (range, 150 to 225 days), no complication occurred that could be attributed to radiation therapy. No aneurysm or angiographically detectable thrombus was observed in any of the irradiated arterial segments. The clinical event rate (4 of 15 patients underwent further target lesion revascularization) and the angiographic follow-up (6 of 15 patients had a > 50%-diameter stenosis at the previously treated site) did not suggest a marked impact on the expected restenosis rate.CONCLUSIONS: This early experience demonstrates that our approach is feasible, and no side effects attributable to radiation were noted during a 6-month period of follow-up. Whether higher doses of beta-irradiation will favorably affect post-PTCA restenosis in patients must await further evaluation.",Excluded

3988,"Prophylactic hyperbaric oxygen treatment and rat spinal cord re-irradiation Normal tissue injury may lead to severe, life threatening, late side effects after therapeutic use of irradiation. Neurological complications caused by radiation of the spinal cord are ascribed to progressive, irreversible damage to the vasculature. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is known to induce angiogenesis in irradiated tissue and has been proven to reduce late radiation injury in several normal tissues when applied during the latent period before complications become manifest. In the present study: (1) the prophylactic potential of HBO; (2) optimal timing of HBO therapy after spinal cord irradiation, i.e. during the latent period; and (3) effect of HBO on the re-irradiation tolerance of the spinal cord were investigated. The rat cervical spinal cord was locally X-ray irradiated with ten fractions of 6.5 Gy in 11 days. Five treatment groups (n=10) included: irradiation alone and irradiation followed by 30 HBO treatments (100% oxygen at 240 kPa for 90 min) during latency, with HBO starting either immediately, 5, 10 or 15 weeks after the primary irradiation course. One year after the primary treatment, the same spinal cord volume was re-irradiated with 20 Gy single dose. During life span, the animals were observed on the incidence of myelitis and the duration of the latent period. The actuarial analysis revealed no significant difference in neurological complications free survival between the irradiation alone and the irradiation+HBO treatment groups. A tendency towards radiosensitization was found in the group in which the primary irradiation course was immediately followed by the HBO treatment course. The data show that HBO applied during the latent period of progressively developing irradiation damage to the spinal cord does not increase the re-irradiation tolerance of this tissue.

All the cases had several unique features of radiation-induced meningioma including features of atypical meningioma. Two patients developed multiple site meningiomas and one patient developed early recurrence of the tumour.

However, relevant real-world data in patients with baseline brain metastasis (BM) as well as the clinical value of upfront cranial local therapy (CLT) remain scarce. Method(s): Untreated EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with BMs receiving first-line Osimertinib or first-generation EGFR-TKIs at our cancer center were retrospectively enrolled. Progression-free survival (PFS), intracranial PFS (iPFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated in the entire cohort and patient groups created by propensity score matching (PSM). Survival outcomes and pattern of treatment failure were also investigated in patient subgroups stratified by the status of BMs, which was classified as oligo-BM (number<=3 and size<=3cm) and multiple-BM (number>=4 or size>3cm). Result(s): Among the 362 patients enrolled, 265 received first-generation EGFR-TKIs (Gefitinib=196, Erlotinib=69) and the rest 97 received Osimertinib. Patients receiving first-line Osimertinib had more (p<0.001) and larger BMs (p=0.011) than those receiving first-generation EGFR-TKIs. With a median follow-up of 17.1 months (range, 2.6-73 months), median PFS and OS was 14.6 months and 31 months, respectively. Patient groups (Osimertinib=97, first-generation group=97) were created by PSM with balanced clinic-pathological parameters, and iPFS (32.5 vs 8.4 months, p<0.001), PFS (34.7 vs 11.5months,p<0.001) and OS (40.6 vs 23.8 months, p=0.041) were significantly longer in the Osimertinib group (Figure a-c). Upfront CLT, including surgery, whole brain radiotherapy and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS), was performed in 129 patients before disease progression and it prolonged iPFS and PFS, but not OS, in the entire cohort. Among patients with baseline oligo-BMs (n=195), upfront CLT (dominated by SRS) improved iPFS (HR=0.443, p=0.001), PFS (HR=0.373, p<0.001) and OS (HR=0.795, p=0.035) (Figure d-f), which was not the case among patients with baseline multiple-BMs. Pattern of failure analyses indicated that more patients with baseline multiple-BMs turned into the status of oligo-BMs at the maximal response to EGFR-TKIs (p=0.023) and less patients developed progressive disease in the central nervous system (p=0.019) among patients receiving upfront CTL than those didn't. Of note, 8 patients with oligo-BMs but didn't receive upfront CLT developed multiple progressive disease in the brain.

4507,"To optimize the CT scanner in SPECT/CT equipment of Nuclear medicine Objective: Since the invention of SPECT/CT, more and more nuclear medicine physicians are adding the CT scanner to improve the efficiency of diagnosis. However, in order to improve the diagnostic accuracy, in the meantime, also increase the patients' radiative dose. Summarized empirical Methods from the previous practice work, we hope to draw an optimized scheme of CT scanner, to reduce patients' radiation doses and dicrease the exposure time of the CT Tube. Method(s): To optimize voltage, current, exposure time, front and back of collimator, pitch factor, matrix and a series of acquisition parameters, we analysis the continuous clinical examples in four months, change the different levels of parameter sloely, and retrospect the CT radiative dose. We also compare to the quality of the image and constantly try to optimize the improvement. In the meantime, we statistics the monthly CT Bulb exposure time, exposure time per capita tube data and so on. Result(s): Compared with former optimization, the average CT radiational dose per person is decreased by 84.72%, Which conventional bone group radiation reduced by 83.82% (t = 24.362, P<0.001), the small joints of the bone group radiation reduced by 88.80% (t = 24.914, P<0.001), cerebral group radiation reduced by 86.78% (t = 61.008, P<0.001), the heart group radiation reduced by 84.49% (t = 52.994, P<0.001), the differences are statistically significant. Optimized CT Tube exposure time is 2031 seconds monthly. Bulb exposure time per capita is significantly decreased, The fourth month per capita ball of tube exposure time is 16.73% of the first month, and the difference is statistically significant (t = 17.458, P<0.001).

4723,"The lateral abdominal island flap--the lateral intercostal neurovascular island flap. [Chinese] This work studied the lateral abdominal island flap, its clinical value, transposition range and the practicability of a modified operative method. Five lateral abdominal island flaps were used in 5 patients. Four of them were for axillary radiation ulcers after radical mastectomy. One was for a sacral defect after resection of a recurrent fibrosarcoma. All the flaps obtained satisfactory results. Clinical applications revealed that the blood supply of the lateral abdominal skin was mainly from the lateral cutaneous branches of the 9th, 10th and 11th intercostal arteries, among which there were numerous anastomoses. The lateral abdominal island flap can be pedicled with any of these lateral cutaneous branches. The long pedicle of the flap provides a wide range of trnasposition from the axilla to the sacrum. As the pedicle of the flap contains the lateral cutaneous branch of the intercostal nerve, the flap can bring sensation function to the recipient area. The modified operative method of the lateral abdominal island flap is introduced.",Excluded

Method(s): Murine brain microvascular endothelial cells bEnd. 3 and astrocytes were co-cultured in a Transwell culture plate and then exposed to X-ray at various doses (5, 10, 20 and 30 Gy) and cultured for 24 hours. The group without radiation acted as a control. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2. Result(s): As compared with the control group, the expression of VEGF increased in 5, 10, 20 and 30 Gy dose groups [(1.71 +/- 0.11), (2.03 +/- 0.05), (2.20 +/- 0.06), (2.19 +/- 0.08) vs (1.26 +/- 0.10), P < 0.05] ; the expression of Ang-1 decreased in 5, 10, 20 and 30 Gy dose groups [(2.27 +/- 0.07), (2.28 +/- 0.06), (2.01 +/- 0.05), (1.54 +/- 0.08) vs (2.46 +/- 0.04), P < 0.05]; the expression of Tie-2 decreased in 5, 10, 20 and 30 Gy dose groups [(2.40 +/- 0.10), (2.47 +/- 0.06), (1.05 +/- 0.09), (1.00 +/- 0.08) vs(4.80 +/- 0.07), P < 0.05]; the expression of Ang-2 increased in 5 Gy and 10 Gy dose groups [(2.10 +/- 0.07), (2.43 +/- 0.08) vs (1.69 +/- 0.05), P < 0.05] while decreased in 20 Gy and 30 Gy dose groups [(1.12 +/- 0.10), (1.21 +/- 0.04) vs (1.69 +/- 0.05), P < 0.05].

4188,"Does past experience impact the brain regions active during the imagery of catastrophic pain? A person can imagine an event never experienced, drawing on constructs of events that have been experienced. For example, a non-astronaut can imagine being on a rocket ship traveling to the moon based on a variety of life experiences. We sought to characterize the brain activity that occurs when one imagines severe catastrophic pain beyond anything ever actually experienced. Our specific goal is to test whether past experience with or without chronic pain is reflected in the brain systems of pain imagery. We completed preliminary analysis on 14 healthy volunteers, 25 individuals with chronic low back pain, and 12 individuals who have recovered from an acute episode of low back pain. During block-design fMRI scanning, participants were instructed to imagine severe catastrophic pain involving bone-crushing injuries while their entire body is on fire. In our preliminary analysis, all groups had prefrontal activity during task performance. Comparing across all three groups, there was relatively little brain activity in individuals who had recovered from low back pain. There was a moderate amount of brain activity for healthy individuals, in a reasonably distributed pattern throughout the brain. There was a large amount of brain activity for individuals with current low back pain, including significant activity of bilateral anterior insula. These preliminary results suggest that experience with pain can be reflected in the imagery of catastrophic pain. The difference between individuals who have experienced recovery versus persistence of pain is particularly striking, and this difference may provide insight into mechanisms with additional data and analysis.",Excluded
4021,"Efficacy in vivo of a cancer therapy strategy combining HSV1716 mediated oncolysis with gene transfer and targeted radiotherapy Oncolytic herpes viruses have show promise for the treatment of cancer however it is unlikely that the optimal application of these viruses will be as single therapeutic agents. An alternative strategy would be to utilise these viruses to deliver therapeutic transgenes and enhance their tumour cell killing capacity. The herpes simplex virus-1 deletion mutant HSV1716 is a conditionally- replicating oncolytic virus. The safety of HSV1716 has been demonstrated in phase 1 clinical trails with no toxicity attributable to the virus in any patients and provided proof of principle that the virus is capable of directly destroying human tumour cells while leaving normal cells intact (1). To enhance its therapeutic potential, we have engineered HSV1716 to convey the noradrenaline transporter gene (NAT) and thus rendered transfected cells targetable with the radiopharmaceutical [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG. [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG is currently used in the treatment of NAT-expressing neuroblastoma, phaeochromocytoma and carcinoids. In this study we have utilised the recombinant virus HSV1716/NAT as a dual cell lysis / gene delivery vehicle for targeting of the NAT transgene to human tumour xenografts in vivo. We have shown that intra-tumoural or intra-venous injection of HSV1716/NAT induced the capacity for active uptake of intra-peritoneal administered [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG in human glioma, melanoma and colorectal tumour xenograft models which do not express NAT. Tumour growth was significantly delayed after administration of HSV1716/NAT and [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG compared to treatment with either agents alone. However, the efficacy of combination treatment was dependent on the scheduling of delivery of the two agents. These findings support a role for combination radio-/gene therapy for cancer utilising HSV1716 expressing the NAT transgene and targeted radionuclide therapy.",Excluded

The DATA (6-amino-1,4-diazapine-triacetate) scaffold represents a novel hybrid chelator architecture possessing both cyclic and acyclic character that may allow for facile access to <sup>68</sup>Ga-labelled tracers in the clinic. We report the first bifunctional DATA chelator conjugated to [Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotide (TOC), a somatostatin subtype 2 receptor (SST<inf>2</inf>)-targeting vector for imaging and functional characterisation of SSTR<inf>2</inf> expressing tumours. Method(s): The radiopharmaceutical precursor, DATA-TOC, was synthesised as previously described and used to complex <sup>nat</sup>Ga(III) and <sup>68</sup>Ga(III). Competition binding assays of [<sup>nat</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC or [<sup>nat</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC against [<sup>125</sup>I-Tyr<sup>25</sup>]LTT-SS28 were conducted in membranes of HEK293 cells transfected to stably express one of the hSST<inf>2,3,5</inf> receptor subtypes (HEK293-hSST<inf>2/3/5</inf> cells). First in vivo studies were performed in female NMRI-nude mice bearing SST<inf>2</inf>-positive mouse phaeochromocytoma mCherry (MPC-mCherry) tumours to compare the in vivo SST<inf>2</inf>-specific tumour-targeting of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC and its overall pharmacokinetics versus the [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC reference. A direct comparison of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC with the well-established PET radiotracer [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC was additionally performed in a 46-year-old male patient with a well-differentiated NET (neuroendocrine tumour), representing the first in human administration of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC. Result(s): DATA-TOC was labelled with <sup>68</sup>Ga with a radiolabelling efficiency of > 95% in less than 10 min at ambient temperature. A molar activity up to 35 MBq/nmol was achieved. The hSST<inf>2</inf>-affinities of [<sup>nat</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC and [<sup>nat</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC were found similar with only sub-nanomolar differences in the respective IC<inf>50</inf> values. In mice, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC was able to visualise the tumour lesions, showing standardised uptake values (SUVs) similar to [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC. Direct comparison of the two PET tracers in a NET patient revealed very similar tumour uptake for the two <sup>68</sup>Ga-radiotracers, but with a higher tumour-to-liver contrast for [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC. Conclusion(s): [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC was prepared, to a quality appropriate for in vivo use, following a highly efficient kit type process. Furthermore, the novel radiopharmaceutical was comparable or better than [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC in all preclinical tests, achieving a higher tumour-to-liver contrast in a NET-patient.

3668,"The polyamine inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine modulates hippocampus-dependent function after single and combined injuries Exposure to uncontrolled irradiation in a radiologic terrorism scenario, a natural disaster or a nuclear battlefield, will likely be concomitantly superimposed on other types of injury, such as trauma. In the central nervous system, radiation combined injury (RCI) involving irradiation and traumatic brain injury may have a multifaceted character. This may entail cellular and molecular changes that are associated with cognitive performance, including changes in neurogenesis and the expression of the plasticity-related immediate early gene Arc. Because traumatic stimuli initiate a characteristic early increase in polyamine metabolism, we hypothesized that treatment with the polyamine inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) would reduce the adverse effects of single or combined injury on hippocampus structure and function. Hippocampal dependent cognitive impairments were quantified with the Morris water maze and showed that DFMO effectively reversed cognitive impairments after all injuries, particularly traumatic brain injury. Similar results were seen with respect to the expression of Arc protein, but not neurogenesis. Given that polyamines have been found to modulate inflammatory responses in the brain we also assessed the numbers of total and newly born activated microglia, and found reduced numbers of newly born cells. While the mechanisms responsible for the improvement in cognition after DFMO treatment are not yet clear, the present study provides new and compelling data regarding the potential use of DFMO as a potential countermeasure against the adverse effects of single or combined injury.",Excluded

4599,"Amide proton transfer MRI of malignant gliomas for detecting active versus inactive tumor Although promising therapies are being advanced for patients with malignant gliomas, a major limitation in developing these therapies is the lack of specificity of neuro-imaging, particularly in distinguishing between tumor progression and treatment-induced injury. Amide proton transfer (APT) MRI is a protein-based molecular imaging technique that uses the water signal to detect amide protons of endogenous mobile proteins in tissue. Our prior data suggest that high APT is a typical feature of active tumor. We hypothesized here that patients with lt; 2% APT intensity after chemoradiation would have a longer progression free survival compared to patients with high APT. METHOD(S): Patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma underwent standard and APTMRimaging at 3T one month after completion of chemoradiation. Patients were followed for time to progression (defined as either pathologically confirmed active tumor post-treatment or a change in therapy based on clinical assessment of progression) as well as overall survival. RESULT(S): Nineteen subjects, 14 male, were enrolled. Eleven had glioblastoma and 8 anaplastic astrocytoma. Twelve subjects had high APT intensity (63.1%) and 7 had low/normal APT intensity. Dose of steroids at time of imaging, time from initial imaging, and dose of radiation treatment was similar between groups. All but one patient received temozolomide with radiation. Median time to progression was 122 days (range 19-488) in the high APT group and 472 days (range 47-698) in the low APT group. Median overall survival was 343 days (range 155-649) in the high APT group and 662 days (495-794) in the low APT group.

Nevertheless, it is associated with great morbidity and in many cases with repetitive surgeries limiting their quality of life. Many techniques have been proposed to reduce the incidence of early and late postsurgical complications, but up to now a safe and unique method to treat this disease has not been reported in the literature. Here we report on three cases of male patients who developed a vesicoenteric fistula after radiation salvage therapy following radical prostatectomy. A rotation bladder flap was used to cover the pelvic floor attempting to reduce the common complications. All of the patients underwent a urinary diversion and a protective colostomy. The 1-year follow-up showed good postsurgical outcomes with minor early complications and no signs of intestinal obstruction or recurrent fistula. Furthermore, perineal and pelvic pain improvement was also achieved. The small number of cases is a limiting factor in defining standard techniques for the treatment of actinic vesicoenteric fistulae. Nevertheless, the use of a rotational bladder flap for repair of the pelvic floor defect has shown promising results and should be indicated in special situations.",Excluded

Glial cells died from both necrosis and apoptosis. Local laser inactivation of a neuron enhanced PD-induced apoptosis of glial cells, thus indicating that neuron maintained the survival of glia. Inter- and intracellular signaling mediated photodamage of these cells. Using inhibitors or activators of signaling proteins, the involvement of Ca(2+)-, adenylate cyclase- and tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling pathways in responses of neurons and glial cells to photosensitization was shown.

3665,"Initial experience with bedside monitoring of stroke and cerebral perfusion using time domain near-infrared spectroscopy (TD-NIRS): Feasibility and future directions Background: Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) may provide continuous, multiregional parenchymal bedside perfusion monitoring without the risks of patient transport, contrast, or radiation. Time-domain NIRS (TD-NIRS) uses pulsed light attenuation at multiple wavelengths (600-950 nm) to discretely quantify oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin and determine total hemoglobin, oxygen saturation (OS) and cerebral blood volume (BV) in the region between each light source and detector. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of employing a novel TD-NIRS technology to assess absolute levels of cerebral BV and OS with broad spatial coverage in order to detect regions of ischemia. Method(s): Ischemic stroke (IS) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients underwent TD-NIRS measurements. IS patients were fitted with a rectangular probe over the region of ischemia (2 rows of 4 sources between 3 rows of 5 detectors), using CT as a guide (external acoustic meatus as reference). SAH patients were fitted with a linear ""anterior crown"" probe with light sources and detectors arranged alternating in a single row (7 sources, 6 detectors). Clearance above the frontal sinus was guided by CT imaging (nasion as reference). 1.8 cm separated all source-detector pairs. Time-correlated single photon-counting photomultiplier tubes detected photons to measure absorption of pulsed light emitted at 3 wavelengths (690, 805, and 835 nm). Maximal OS (OSmax) and BV (BVmax) were calculated for the entire region measured by the probe to enable multiple comparisons. Result(s): In IS patients, ischemic regions (n=4) had an OSmax of 65.8 SD 13.1; contralateral normal tissue had an OSmax of 85.3 SD 27.1 (paired t-test; p 0.14). Ischemic regions had a BVmax of 76.25 SD 24.17 compared with 104.0 SD 42.5 in contralateral normal tissue (p 0.18). Regional inspection showed good visual correlation with infarcts (Figure). Of SAH patients with serial measures (n=2), one developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and bilateral infarcts, coincident with decreased BVmax on the right (72, day 1; 48, day 12) and left (153, day 1; 56, day 12); OS did not change. Conclusion(s): We were able to calculate multiregional BV and OS for patients with cerebral ischemia. Despite small sample size, we demonstrated a trend between contralateral (ischemic stroke) and historical (subarachnoid hemorrhage) controls. Leakage of light and absorption by hair produced artifacts that will require improvement in future applications.

We measured pulmonary tissue volume (Vti), capillary blood flow, and diffusing capacity in four subjects before, during, and after 10 days of exposure to microG during spaceflight. Measurements were made by rebreathing a gas mixture containing small amounts of acetylene, carbon monoxide, and argon. Measurements made early in flight in two subjects showed no change in Vti despite large increases in stroke volume (40%) and diffusing capacity (13%) consistent with increased pulmonary capillary blood volume. Late in-flight measurements in four subjects showed a 25% reduction in Vti compared with preflight controls (P < 0.001). There was a concomittant reduction in stroke volume, to the extent that it was no longer significantly different from preflight control. Diffusing capacity remained elevated (11%; P < 0.05) late in flight.

The aim of this study was to determine the responses of the spinal cord dorsal horn neurons to stimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex (SSC). We hypothesized that direct stimulation of the SSC will inhibit the activity of spinal dorsal horn neurons by activating the descending inhibitory system. Thirty-four wide dynamic range spinal dorsal horn neurons were recorded in response to graded mechanical stimulation (brush, pressure, and pinch) at their respective receptive fields while a stepwise electrical stimulation (300 Hz, 0.1 ms, at 10, 20, and 30 V) was applied in the SSC through a bipolar tungsten electrode. The responses to brush at control, 10 V, 20 V, 30 V, and recovery were 16.0 +/- 2.3, 15.8 +/- 2.2, 14.6 +/- 1.8, 14.8 +/- 2.0, and 17.0 +/- 2.2 spikes/s, respectively.

Crb1 localizes specifically to the sub-apical region adjacent to the adherens junction complex at the outer limiting membrane in the retina. We show that it is associated here with multiple PDZ protein 1 (Mupp1), protein associated with Lin-7 (Pals1 or Mpp5) and Mpp4. We have produced Crb1(-/-) mice completely lacking any functional Crb1. Although the retinas are initially normal, by 3-9 months the Crb1(-/-) retinas develop localized lesions where the integrity of the outer limiting membrane is lost and giant half rosettes are formed. After delamination of the photoreceptor layer, neuronal cell death occurs in the inner and outer nuclear layers of the retina. On moderate exposure to light for 3 days at 3 months of age, the number of severe focal retinal lesions significantly increases in the Crb1(-/-) retina. Crb2, Crb3 and Crb1 interacting proteins remain localized to the sub-apical region and therefore are not sufficient to maintain cell adhesion during light exposure in Crb1(-/-) retinas. Thus we propose that during light exposure Crb1 is essential to maintain, but not assemble, adherens junctions between photoreceptors and Muller glia cells and prevents retinal disorganization and dystrophy. Hence, light may be an influential factor in the development of the corresponding human diseases.",Excluded

The data from 13 patients treated between 1984 and 2006 satisfied the World Health Organization 2007 definition of Grade III meningioma. A total of 24 surgeries were performed, including 13 primary, 7 salvage, and 4 second salvage. Also, 14 courses of radiotherapy (RT) were administered, including fractionated RT in 3 patients after primary surgery, fractionated RT in 4 patients after salvage surgery, salvage stereotactic radiosurgery to six separate areas in 3 patients, and salvage intensity-modulated RT in 1 patient.RESULTS: From the primary surgery, the median survival was 3.4 years, the 5-year survival rate was 47.2%, and the 8-year survival rate was 12.2%. The median time to recurrence was 9.6 months. A trend was seen toward longer survival for patients who had received adjuvant RT after initial surgery compared with those treated with surgery alone.

Specifically, we used a commonly employed graph-based measure of network organization, i.e., degree centrality (DC), to perform a full-brain exploration of the regions that were influenced by simulated microgravity. We subsequently examined the functional connectivities of these regions using a seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis. We found decreased DC in two regions, the left anterior insula (aINS) and the anterior part of the middle cingulate cortex (MCC; also called the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in many studies), in the male volunteers after 45 days of -6degree HDT bed rest. Furthermore, seed-based RSFC analyses revealed that a functional network anchored in the aINS and MCC was particularly influenced by simulated microgravity. These results provide evidence that simulated microgravity alters the resting-state functional architecture of the brains of males and suggest that the processing of salience information, which is primarily subserved by the aINS-MCC functional network, is particularly influenced by spaceflight. The current findings provide a new perspective for understanding the relationships between microgravity, cognitive function, autonomic neural function, and central neural activity.",Excluded

4526,"M.I.T./Canadian vestibular experiments on the Spacelab-1 mission: 3. Effects of prolonged weightlessness on a human otolith-spinal reflex Reflex responses that depend on human otolith organ sensitivity were measured before, during and after a 10 day space flight. Otolith-spinal reflexes were elicited by means of sudden, unexpected falls. In weightlessness, ""falls"" were achieved using elastic cords running from a torso harness to the floor. Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from gastrocnemius-soleus. The EMG response occurring in the first 100-120 ms of a fall, considered to be predominantly otolith-spinal in origin, decreased in amplitude immediately upon entering weightlessness, and continued to decline throughout the flight, especially during the first two mission days. The response returned to normal before the first post-flight testing session. The results suggest that information coming from the otolith organs is gradually ignored by the nervous system during prolonged space flight, although the possibility that otolith-spinal reflexes are decreased independent of other otolith output pathways cannot be ruled out.",Excluded

3841,"Principles of diagnostic sonography in iliopsoas tendon pathology: A case report This article describes the diagnostic value of musculoskeletal sonography in the management of tendon pathology and outlines a clinical example of its scope of utilization. Herein we describe the case of a 65-year-old man who sought rehabilitation services for left groin pain following a period of intense trekking and uphill walking. He presented with left hip flexor weakness and local tenderness over the left iliopsoas tendon with negative findings on neurological evaluation. Additionally, he presented with left hip capsule and hip flexor tightness with left gluteus maximus and gluteus medius weakness. The left hip capsule tightness was predominantly in the posterior fibres, with restriction of hip internal rotation. The clinical picture overall was suggestive of the presence of risk parameters for iliopsoas tendinopathy. Plain radiographs of the hip revealed mild degenerative changes with a mild pincer impingement. While his clinical and radiological picture was suggestive of degenerative and soft tissue pathology of the hip, a real-time sonographic study was useful in the quantitative confirmation of a partial tear of the left iliopsoas tendon. Additionally, a repeat sonographic study performed four weeks later, revealed a healing iliopsoas tendon seen as a decrease in the width of the hypoechoic presentation of the tear. To summarize, the value of musculoskeletal sonography as a diagnostic tool as well as the assessment of the progression of tendon healing is discussed. Sonography is safe, noninvasive, and does not use ionizing radiation. It is steadily gaining popularity in the diagnosis of tendon lesions.",Excluded
4586,"Measuring smoking-induced extrastriatal dopamine release: A [11C]FLB-457 pet study Background: Preclinical studies indicate that nicotine can induce dopamine (DA) release in striatal and cortical brain regions, contributing to the reinforcing and cognitive effects respectively. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies using the D2/3 radiotracer [11C] raclopride to indirectly measure DA release via receptor occupancy have confirmed that tobacco smoking releases DA in striatal regions in humans. However, due to the low density of DA receptors in the cortex it was not possible to measure extrastriatal DA release in humans until the recent development of high affinity D2/3 radiotracers. In this study we used the high affinity D2/3 radiotracer [11C]FLB-457 to index tobacco-induced extrastriatal DA release in smokers. Method(s): Ten nicotine-dependent daily cigarette smokers underwent two high affinity [11C]FLB-457 PET scans: after overnight abstinence and smoking reinstatement (biochemically verified by expired carbon monoxide and plasma nicotine levels). Craving, withdrawal, mood and cognitive performance were assessed under both smoking conditions. Voxel-wise parameter estimation of binding potential (BPND) was performed using the basis function implementation of SRTM with the tissue time activity curve of the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. Spatially normalized [11C]FLB-457 BPND maps were statistically investigated to assess significant changes between the two conditions at every voxel using paired-tests (SPM 8). Results from the whole-brain voxel-wise paired t-test (abstinence 4 smoking) were masked with a map of a-priori regions of interest and subjected to an uncorrected threshold of p<0.05, with a minimum 30-voxel cluster extent. Result(s): There was a reduction [11C]FLB-457 BPND following smoking (an indirect measure of DA release) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; 323 voxels, peak t=3.38, p=0.004), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex/ anterior cingulate cortex (dmPFC / ACC; 1496 voxels, peak t=5.32, p<0.001), both of which survived a more stringent threshold of p<0.01, and the left insula (47 voxels, peak t=2.54 p=0.016). Exploratory analysis focused on limbic regions identified an effect in the bilateral amygdala (Left: 102 voxels, peak t=3.28, p=0.005; Right: 108 voxels, peak t =3.03, p=0.007). Extraction of values from these clusters revealed % changes in BPND in smoking versus abstinence conditions of -12.0% (SD=9.4) in the dlPFC, -11.5% (SD=12.8) in the dmPFC/ACC, -7.1% (SD=7.9) in the left insula and -13.1% in the bilateral amygdala. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of smoking-induced DA release in cortical regions such as the dlPFC, dmPFC and ACC. There was also some evidence for DA release in the insula and amygdala. The dmPFC, ACC, insula and amygdala are regions consistently associated with tobacco cue-presentaton, subjective craving and relapse susceptibility in fMRI studies, while the dlPFC appears to exert top-down control on tobacco craving and is involved in tobacco's pro-cognitive effects. As such [11C]FLB- 457 may be a useful tool to investigate individual differences in tobacco addiction severity and treatment response.",Excluded
3639,"Exposure to different wavelengths of light and the development of structural and functional asymmetries in the chicken The thalamofugal visual projections of the chick are known to develop in response to stimulation by light prior to hatching, and asymmetry in the number of projections develops as a consequence of the embryo being oriented in the egg so that it occuludes its left eye. The right eye only is stimulated by light and this causes the visual projections connected to the right eye to develop in advance of those connected to the left. We have now found that exposure of embryos, from day 19 of incubation to hatching, to red (peak transmission at 670 nm) or green (peak at 500 nm) light is as effective as broad-spectrum (white) light in establishing asymmetry in these projections. The intensities of the light to which the embryos were exposed in each case were equivalent, achieved in part by removing the air sac end of the egg shell. The thalamofugal visual projections, therefore, develop in response to light stimulation but appear to have no wavelength specificity. This result is consistent with the apparent lack of involvement of the thalamofugal visual pathway in colour vision. However, functional asymmetry, tested as left-right eye differences in categorising grain from pebbles, was found to be less marked in the chicks that had been exposed to green light compared to those that had been exposed to 'while' light, and it was absent in those exposed to red light or incubated in the dark. Thus, there is wavelength specificity for the development of the behavioural asymmetry, which suggests involvement of colour-coded neurons outside the thalamofugal visual pathway, probably in the tectofugal pathway. Exposure of the embryos to red and green light alternating at 30 min intervals is as effective as ""white' light for establishing both the structural and functional asymmetry.",Excluded
4391,"Quantitative and qualitative intrapatient comparison of 68Ga-DOTATOC and 68Ga-DOTATATE: net uptake rate for accurate quantification UNLABELLED: Quantitative imaging and dosimetry are crucial for individualized treatment during peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). (177)Lu-DOTATATE and (68)Ga-DOTATOC/(68)Ga-DOTATATE are used, respectively, for PRRT and PET examinations targeting somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) in patients affected by neuroendocrine tumors. The aim of the study was to quantitatively and qualitatively compare the performance of (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE in the context of subsequent PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE under standardized conditions in the same patient as well as to investigate the sufficiency of standardized uptake value (SUV) for estimation of SSTR expression.METHODS: Ten patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors underwent one 45-min dynamic and 3 whole-body PET/CT examinations at 1, 2, and 3 h after injection with both tracers. The number of detected lesions, SUVs in lesions and normal tissue, total functional tumor volume, and SSTR volume (functional tumor volume multiplied by mean SUV) were investigated for each time point. Net uptake rate (Ki) was calculated according to the Patlak method for 3 tumors per patient.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in lesion count, lesion SUV, Ki, functional tumor volume, or SSTR volume between (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE at any time point. The detection rate was similar, although with differences for single lesions in occasional patients. For healthy organs, marginally higher uptake of (68)Ga-DOTATATE was observed in kidneys, bone marrow, and liver at 1 h. (68)Ga-DOTATOC uptake was higher in mediastinal blood pool at the 1-h time point (P = 0.018). The tumor-to-liver ratio was marginally higher for (68)Ga-DOTATOC at the 3-h time point (P = 0.037). Blood clearance was fast and similar for both tracers. SUV did not correlate with Ki linearly and achieved saturation for a Ki of greater than 0.2 mL/cm(3)/min, corresponding to an SUV of more than 25.CONCLUSION: (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (68)Ga-DOTATATE are suited equally well for staging and patient selection for PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE. However, the slight difference in the healthy organ distribution and excretion may render (68)Ga-DOTATATE preferable. SUV did not correlate linearly with Ki and thus may not reflect the SSTR density accurately at its higher values, whereas Ki might be the outcome measure of choice for quantification of SSTR density and assessment of treatment outcome.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): The Guidelines approved in 2009 by the SIR Safety and Health Committee and the CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee have been applied in a university hospital over the last two years to identify patients with potential skin injuries after procedures over thresholds requiring follow-up: peak skin dose >3 Gy, reference point air kerma >5 Gy, kerma area product >500 Gy.cm2 or fluoroscopy time >60 min. X-ray system (biplane with flat detectors) was under a quality assurance program and patient dose records were archived individually according to the national regulations. Result(s): A total of 325 procedures (43% therapeutic, mainly cerebral embolizations) were included in the database during 2009 and 383 (40% therapeutic) during 2010. Out of these samples, and after analysing each dose report individually, during 2009, 20 patients (6.2%) were included in a follow-up program for potential skin injuries, while in 2010, after introducing several optimization actions, only 6 patients (1.6%) required the follow-up. The maximum patient dose values measured in a single procedure were 1405 Gy.cm2 and 10.8 Gy (cumulative skin dose). 11 patients resulted with radiation injuries. Conclusion(s): The application of the SIR-CIRSE Guidelines allowed standardizing the selection criteria to include certain patients in a follow-up program.

Data from 86 centers across the world were analyzed. All CT interactions were automatically collected and transmitted to the CT vendor during two 6-week periods immediately before and 2 weeks after implementation of ATVS. A total of 164 323 unique CT studies were analyzed. Studies were categorized by body region and type of examination. Tube voltage and volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) were compared between examinations performed with ATVS and those performed before ATVS implementation. Descriptive statistical methods and multilevel linear regression models were used for analysis.RESULTS: Across all types of CT examinations and body regions, CTDIvol was 14.7% lower in examinations performed with ATVS (n = 30 313) than in those performed before ATVS implementation (n = 79 275). Relative reductions in mean CTDIvol were most notable for temporal bone CT (-56.1%), peripheral runoff CT angiography (-48.6%), CT of the paranasal sinus (-39.6%), cerebral or carotid CT angiography (-36.4%), coronary CT angiography (-25.1%), and head CT (-23.9%). An increase in mean CTDIvol was observed for renal stone protocols (26.2%) and thoracic or lumbar spine examinations (6.6%).

This approach creates a regression tree according to prognostic variables which partitions into homogenous subsets according to survival. Four protocols, RTOG 83-11, 83-21, 84-03 and 84-07 were analyzed. 83-11 and 84-07 were studies utilizing irradiation with 'alterfractionation; 83-21 and 84-03 were studies evaluating thymocin with irradiation and prophylactic cranial irradiation with thoracic irradiation respectively. Nine pretreatment variables and one treatment variable were analyzed. Adjustment for radiotherapy effect was made in the accelerated treatment protocol (84-07). Overall, median survival for the entire group was 9.0 months with 17% alive at 2 years. Univariate analysis suggests that KPS, <=70 vs. 80-100, pleural effusion, weight loss, <=5% vs. 5%, age, 60 + vs. < 60, T stage (T1 and T2 vs. T3 and T4) and N stage (N- vs. N +) were important prognastic factors. Radiation dose, sex, race and histology were not univariate prognastic factors. RPA identified KPS as the most significant covariate (median survival 5.9 mos. <= 70 vs. 9.9 mos. 80-100). Within KPS 80-100 other splits occurred for N stage, age, weight loss and radiation therapy dose. KPS 170 split at pleural effusion only. The best overall RPA tree has four distinct classes with median survival times ranging from 3.3 to 12.6 months. The RPA classes were validated in an independent non-small cell lung cancer dataset.

Selecting appropriate treatment remains a challenging problem for orthopedic physicians. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical effects of minimally invasive adjustable plate and locking compression plate in treatment of unstable pelvic fractures via posterior approach.METHODS: From January 2009 to June 2012, fifty-six patients with unstable pelvic fractures were included. After at least 12-month follow-up, forty-four patients treated with two methods were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups: minimally invasive adjustable plate (group A) and locking compression plate (group B). Preoperative and postoperative radiography was taken to assess the fracture displacement and reduction quality. The size of incision, operation duration, blood loss, duration of X-ray exposures, Majeed postoperative functional evaluation and Lindahl postoperative reduction evaluation were analyzed.RESULTS: The mean follow-up in group A was 27.3 months (range, 13-48 months), and that in group B was 21.8 months (range, 12-42 months). There were no iatrogenic neurovascular injuries during the operations in the two groups. In group B, malunion was observed in one patient, and infection of incision was observed in one case. The operation duration, blood loss, and size of incision of group A were significantly less than that of group B. There was no significant difference in the duration of X-ray exposures between the two groups. The Majeed functional evaluation score in group A was significantly higher than that in group B. The difference of the imaging score of the retained displacement was not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Both the two methods can effectively stabilize the unstable pelvic fractures. However, the minimally invasive adjustable plate has the advantages of minimally invasive, less radiation exposure, technically safe and time saving.

3873,"PCI-no What does prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) prevent in ED-SCLC? - Why isn't the presence of brain metastasis evaluated before performing PCI? Background: In a European trial, prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was performed on patients with extensive-disease small cell lung cancer (ED- SCLC). As a result, PCI was reported to reduce the incidence of symptomatic brain metastasis and to prolong patient survival. However, their treatments were completely different from our routine medical care. For example, they did not perform tests to examine whether there was a metastatic brain tumor before assignment to the PCI group or observation group and, after assignment, symptoms alone were observed and no imaging test was performed. For this reason, in Japan, we corrected this inconsistency of protocol and repeated the trial to determine whether PCI contributes to prolonged survival. Participants and Method: Included in the current trial were patients who underwent two or more cycles of platinum-based combination chemotherapy, had achieved at least stable disease (SD), and had no metastatic brain tumor on their MRI. They were randomly assigned to either the PCI group or observation group. Follow-up with brain, chest and abdominal diagnostic imaging tests was performed every three months in both groups. Result(s): In the first pre-specified interim analysis, it was found that there was no possibility of improving patient prognosis using PCI even if the trial were continued. An independent data monitoring committee therefore terminated the trial. At that time, 224 cases had already been enrolled, with 113 cases assigned to the PCI group and 111 cases to the observation group. Median survival period in the final analysis was 11.6 months for the PCI group and 13.7 months for the observation group (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.68). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups, but PCI actually tended to make the prognosis somewhat worse or, at least, did not improve prognosis in patients with ED-SCLC. Discussion(s): The biggest difference between the two trials was whether follow-up assessments were conducted using symptoms or brain MRI. In the current trial, it is impossible to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic brain metastasis cases; however, in the European trial, asymptomatic brain metastasis cases were also included, which means that there were in fact two different subgroups in the PCI group: a subgroup of patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis undergoing therapeutic cranial irradiation and a subgroup of patients without brain metastasis undergoing true PCI. It seems that the survival difference between patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis in the PCI group and in the observation group caused the apparent improvement of survival period. On the other hand, it is conjectured that PCI generated a lot of toxic effects in the patients without brain metastasis and that their survival curve tended to be inferior. PCI is a treatment to prevent new brain metastasis. One year of PCI reduces the incidence of new brain metastasis in no more than 30% of cases. For patients with MRI showing no metastatic brain tumor, needless PCI can be avoided by performing regular brain imaging tests, without impairing survival.",Excluded
3631,"Myelomatous involvement of the dura mater: A rare complication of multiple myeloma A case of myelomatous involvement of the dura mater is reported. The patient presented with blurring of vision in the right visual field and left sided facial numbness.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed no plasmacytosis and although there was a raised CSF protein concentration, no paraprotein band was detected, despite the presence of serum paraprotein. The infiltration of the dura mater is likely to have arisen by spread from contiguous bone lesions, contrasting with the pattern of spread seen in myelomatous involvement of the leptomeninges, which probably occurs through haematogenous seeding of the meninges. Leptomeningeal involvement is associated with a very poor prognosis; however, this patient had a favourable response to combined chemotherapy and cranial radiotherapy, suggesting that myelomatous involvement of the dura mater should be considered as a distinct complication of myeloma.",Excluded
3995,"Photopigment self-screening and the determination of macular pigment absorbance using heterochromatic flicker photometry PURPOSE: Heterochromatic flicker photometry (HFP) is commonly used to determine macular pigment optical density (MPOD). Since HFP in this application is a locus comparison method, an identical relative spectral response at each locus is required for a perfect measure. We know this requirement cannot be strictly true since the optical density of photopigments increases as the foveal center is approached. Thus, the self-screening effect would result in an underestimate of MPOD. An earlier study concluded that the underestimate is on the order of 30%. We examined this issue by manipulating photopigment optical density, and consequently the degree of selfscreening.METHODS: A continuously exposed, 470 nm, background bleached cone photopigments over a range from 0 to 80%. MPOD was determined 10' and 30' from the foveal center. Two subjects were used in the main experiment. Five additional subjects were studied with just the 0% and 80% bleach levels. Spectral measures were obtained at 0% and 70% bleach levels for the two primary subjects.RESULTS: Subjects in the main experiment showed MPOD estimates that increased with increasing bleaching. The effect, however, was small: one observer's MPOD increased 0.08 and 0.02 for the 10' and 30' loci, respectively; the other observer's values were 0.04 and 0.01 for the same loci. Comparable values were obtained for the other five subjects using the 0% and 80% bleach conditions. Spectral measures were consistent with the findings of the main experiment.CONCLUSIONS: When self-screening is nearly abolished (80% bleach), a relatively small underestimation is revealed for the unbleached state. For the 1degree target we show about 2-3% underestimation. Our 20' target reveals a larger underestimate (8-9%), consistent with longer photoreceptor outer-segments nearer the foveal center. We conclude that HFP yields values essentially independent of self-screening for targets of 1degree diameter or greater. Smaller targets are less than 10% underestimated for near-zero bleach conditions.",Excluded
4748,"Biological effects of prolonged exposure to ELF electromagnetic fields in rats: III. 50 Hz electromagnetic fields Groups of adult male Sprague Dawley rats (64 rats each) were exposed for 8 months to electromagnetic fields (EMF) of two different field strength combinations: 5microT - 1kV/m and 100microT - 5kV/m. A third group was sham exposed. Field exposure was 8 hrs/day for 5 days/week. Blood samples were collected for hematology determinations before the onset of exposure and at 12 week intervals. At sacrifice, liver, heart, mesenteric lymph nodes, bone marrow, and testes were collected for morphology and histology assessments, while the pineal gland and brain were collected for biochemical determinations. At both field strength combinations, no pathological changes were observed in animal growth rate, in morphology and histology of the collected tissue specimens (liver, heart, mesenteric lymph nodes, testes, bone marrow), and in serum chemistry. An increase in norepinephrine levels occurred in the pineal gland of rats exposed to the higher field strength. The major changes in the brain involved the opioid system in frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and hippocampus. From the present findings it may be hypothesized that EMF may cause alteration of some brain functions.",Excluded
4646,"FDTD analysis of a noninvasive hyperthermia system for brain tumors Hyperthermia is considered one of the new therapeutic modalities for cancer treatment and is based on the difference in thermal sensitivity between healthy tissues and tumors. During hyperthermia treatment, the temperature of the tumor is raised to 40-45degreeC for a definite period resulting in the destruction of cancer cells. This paper investigates design, modeling and simulation of a new non-invasive hyperthermia applicator system capable of effectively heating deep seated as well as superficial brain tumors using inexpensive, simple, and easy to fabricate components without harming surrounding healthy brain tissues. The proposed hyperthermia applicator system is composed of an air filled partial half ellipsoidal chamber, a patch antenna, and a head model with an embedded tumor at an arbitrary location. The irradiating antenna is placed at one of the foci of the hyperthermia chamber while the center of the brain tumor is placed at the other focus. The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method is used to compute both the SAR patterns and the temperature distribution in three different head models due to two different patch antennas at a frequency of 915 MHz. The obtained results suggest that by using the proposed noninvasive hyperthermia system it is feasible to achieve sufficient and focused energy deposition and temperature rise to therapeutic values in deep seated as well as superficial brain tumors without harming surrounding healthy tissue. The proposed noninvasive hyperthermia system proved suitable for raising the temperature in tumors embedded in the brain to therapeutic values by carefully selecting the systems components. The operator of the system only needs to place the center of the brain tumor at a pre-specified location and excite the antenna at a single frequency of 915 MHz. Our study may provide a basis for a clinical applicator prototype capable of heating brain tumors.",Excluded

4191,"Spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties: implications for elevated cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure Evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and diminished in astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were isolated from 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for in vitro vascular and mechanical testing. Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were lower and vascular distensibility greater in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice (n=7) relative to ground-based control group (GC) mice (n=12). Basilar artery maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236+/-9 mum and GC: 215+/-5 mum) with no difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4+/-1.6 mum; GC: 12.2+/-1.2 mum). Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized via nanoindentation, was lower in SF mice (SF: 3.4+/-0.3 N/m; GC: 5.4+/-0.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of perfusion could contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an associated impairment of visual acuity in astronauts during spaceflight.",Included

4342,"Use of and irradiation from plain lumbar spine radiography in Switzerland PRINCIPLES: Plain lumbar spine radiographic examination (LSRE) is frequently used in medical practice and delivers a high dose of ionising radiation. The objectives of the study were to determine the annual frequency of LSRE in Switzerland and its distribution according to practitioners' and patients' characteristics, as well as the related population dose of ionising radiation.METHODS: Data were extrapolated from a nationwide questionnaire survey on radiation exposure resulting from medical imaging in 1998, involving physicians and other healthcare providers performing radiological examinations in Switzerland.RESULTS: An estimated number of 273,000 LSRE are performed annually in Switzerland (39 LSRE per 1000 inhabitants per year). The collective dose to the population due to LSRE was 1130 Sv (0.16 mSv per person per year). 50-60% of these procedures were performed to confirm or rule out a diagnosis, the majority (85%) in the context of an illness.CONCLUSIONS: LSRE is the third most frequent radiographic procedure performed and delivers the highest population dose of ionising radiation of any radiodiagnostic procedure. Efforts to reduce the frequency and the radiation dose of this procedure must be kept up, technically by optimising the equipment and radioprotection measures, and clinically by implementing evidence-based approaches to appropriate indications for this imaging technique.",Excluded
4356,"Radiation target delineation of micro brain arteriovenous malformations using highresolution flat-detector cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) Purpose Radiation therapy has shown to be an effective treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs).1 2 Target delineation is commonly performed on volumetric image data, such as MRI or CT data. However, the nidi of micro-AVMs may not be visualized adequately by these modalities due to their limited image resolution. In this report, we show a novel usage of high-resolution contrastenhanced cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging and multi-modal image registration<sup>3</sup> for radiation target delineation of a micro-AVM, a technique previously suggested for larger AVMs.4 Case A 42-year-old male presented with intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the mesencephalic tectum and left posterior thalamus. Conventional angiography revealed a left superior collicular AVM with a nidus of 3mm. The AVM was successfully embolized but follow-up angiography examinations at 36 months demonstrated a small re-growth of the AVM (Abstract P-017 figure 1A). The patient was thus referred to radiosurgery. Thin slice contrast and non-contrast MRI acquired for target delineation did not show the AVM nidus. Therefore, the patient was transferred to the angiography suite for high resolution contrast-enhanced CBCT. Data was acquired using the angiography c-arm system with a reduced detector size of 22 cm. Contrast was injected with 2 ml/s for a total of 64 ml and a 2 sec delay) using a coupled power injector into the left vertebral artery with a 5Fr catheter. Volumetric CBCT data (FOV: 70<sup>3</sup>mm<sup>3</sup>, matrix: 0.14<sup>3</sup>mm<sup>3</sup>) was generated using a nonbinned reconstruction algorithm. Lesion and nidus were visualized with CBCT. MRI, CT-simulator and CBCT data was then transferred to the radiation planning software and mutually co-registered. The nidus was delineated on CBCT data by an experienced neurointerventional radiologist for radiation therapy and dose/ treatment plan was completed. Due to image registration, the target area could be directly transferred to MRI and CT data (Abstract P-0017 figure 1B). The patient received a total of 4 radiation sessions. Discussion and Conclusion Radiation target delineation of micro AVMs can be challenging with conventional 3D imaging techniques as their spatial resolution is relatively low for the application of visualization of the nidus. We were able to demonstrate the complementary value of high resolution contrast enhanced CBCT in radiation target delineation of a micro brain AVM. Multi-modal image registration of CBCTwith MRI and CT-simulator has shown to be an effective method for radiation target delineation. (Figure presented).",Excluded
3971,"Gamma knife is effective for type II neurofibromatosisassociated meningioma: A 16-year mayo experience Introduction/Objective: Type 2 neurofibromatosis (NF2) is a debilitating genetic condition characterized by multiple meningiomas, vestibular schwannomas, and other intracranial and intraspinal tumors such as ependymomas. We reported our experience treating a series of NF2-associated meningiomas with Gamma Knife (GK). Method(s): Between January 1992 and December 2008, 16 consecutive patients (7 male, 9 female, age 20 to 81) with 58 intracranial meningiomas were treated with single-fraction GK. Thirty-three tumors (57%) involved the convexity or parasagittal/falx, 25 (43%) skullbased. None of these meningiomas received prior surgery. Nine patients (56%) had more than 1 meningoma (range, 2 to 4) at presentation. Six patients (38%) also had intraspinal meningiomas which were never treated by radiation. All patients had bilateral (81%) or unilateral (19%) vestibular schwannomas. During follow-up, 6 patients (38%) developed 26 (46%) new intracranial meningomas, termed distant progression, requiring secondary treatments. The median prescription dose was 16 Gy (range, 13 to 20), with a maximum dose of 32 Gy (range, 24 to 40). The median heterogeneity index was 2 (range, 1.3 to 2.5). The median tumor diameter and prescription isodose volume were 2.3 cm and 3.6 cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) between GK shots per tumor (median 4, range 1 to 22) versus tumor volume was 0.59. The median radiographic and clinical followup periods were 62 and 86 months, respectively. Result(s): Over a median follow-up period of 3.1 years (range, 0.4 to 14.6), ten patients (63%) required only one treatment, and 6 (37%) required 1 to 6 additional treatments for distant progression. Fifteen (93.8%) patients were alive at last follow-up, with fifty-five tumors (94.8%) controlled (smaller or unchanged in size). Three in-field tumors (5.2%) became larger at 36, 56 and 82 months, respectively, but were not re-treated; they belonged to the same patient who had 14 meningomas treated over 7 times (in 12.7 y). There were no marginal failures. The median time to first radiographic distant progression was 13.7 months (range, 6.2 to 77.5). One minor complication was noted at 12 months, with hemi-body sensory changes which resolved. Two major radiation-related complications occurred at 1 and 3 months, including a 34-year-old woman who died following GK for a parasagittal meningioma. GK-related complication rates remained low overall, and were not associated with tumor volume, location, prescription dose, or chosen isodose level. Conclusion(s): GK is an effective treatment for NF2 patients with meningoma, with 5-year local control rate greater than 90% in our series. Side effects are rare but can be life-threatening including radionecrosis, which may occur within three months after treatment. For NF2 patients who developed distant progression and required repeat treatments elsewhere intracranially, secondary GK appeared safe and equally successful when compared with primary treatment. No high-grade meningoma or secondary non-meningioma malignancy were found as a result of GK radiation exposure.",Excluded
3833,"Epidemiology and molecular pathology of glioma Gliomas account for almost 80% of primary malignant brain tumors, and they result in more years of life lost than do any other tumors. Glioblastoma, the most common type of glioma, is associated with very poor survival, so glioma epidemiology has focused on identifying factors that can be modified to prevent this disease. Only two relatively rare factors have so far been conclusively shown to affect glioma risk--exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation, and inherited mutations of highly penetrant genes associated with rare syndromes. In addition, preliminary evidence points to a lower glioma risk among people with allergic conditions and high levels of serum IgE. Recent research has focused on identifying germline polymorphisms associated with risk of glioma, and using molecular markers to classify glial tumors into more-homogenous groups. Because gene products probably interact with environmental factors or developmental signals to produce gliomas, large studies are needed to analyze associations between polymorphisms and glioma. Cohort studies of immune factors and glioma risk are being undertaken to validate the results of case-control studies. Studies of polymorphisms of genetic pathways with strong prior hypotheses are being planned, and whole-genome scans are being proposed to study high-risk families and case-control series. The Brain Tumor Epidemiology Consortium has been formed to co-ordinate these studies. [References: 69]",Excluded
4811,"Reirradiation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma focusing on volumetric modulated arcs with flattening filter-free beams Objective: The goal of this study was to assess the role of flattening filter-free (FFF) beams in volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy for patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC). Method(s): 13 patients with rNPC were replanned for FFF RapidArc<sup>-></sup> (RA-FFF) and conventional RapidArc (RA) (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Quantitative evaluation was performed for the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs). Phantom dose verifications, treatment delivery time and monitor units (MUs) were also assessed. Result(s): Each technique delivered similar doses to the PTV. RA-FFF had a better sparing effect on the brain stem and normal tissue when compared with RA, whereas RA provided lower mean doses to the skin. No significant difference between the two techniques could be established for other OAR parameters. Both techniques showed equally good gamma scores in dosimetric verification. RAFFF required more MUs than RA, whereas the delivery time for RA-FFF was slightly shorter than for RA. Conclusion(s): Both treatment plans met the planning objectives. Dose measurements also showed good agreement with computed doses. In addition to slightly faster delivery times, RA-FFF produced better sparing of brain stem and normal tissue with uncompromised target coverage compared with RA. Advances in knowledge: FFF beams have recently been assembled for clinical use. Our findings show RA-FFF is useful in the salvage treatment of rNPC owing to better brain stem and normal tissue sparing with uncompromised target coverage compared with RA. This may be beneficial in the case of tumour invasion close to the brain stem. Copyright Â© 2015 The Authors. Published by the British Institute of Radiology.",Excluded
4187,"Effects of low intensity radiofrequency electromagnetic fields on electrical activity in rat hippocampal slices Slices of rat hippocampus were exposed to 700 MHz continuous wave radiofrequency (RF) fields (25.2-71.0 V m(-1), 5-15 min exposure) in a stripline waveguide. At low field intensities, the predominant effect on the electrically evoked field potential in CA1 was a potentiation of the amplitude of the population spike by up to 20%, but higher intensity fields could produce either increases or decreases of up to 120 and 80%, respectively, in the amplitude of the population spike. To eliminate the possibility of RF-induced artefacts due to the metal stimulating electrode, the effect of RF exposure on spontaneous epileptiform activity induced in CA3 by 4-aminopyridine (50-100 microM) was investigated. Exposure to RF fields (50.0 V m(-1)) reduced or abolished epileptiform bursting in 36% of slices tested. The maximum field intensity used in these experiments, 71.0 V m(-1), was calculated to produce a specific absorption rate (SAR) of between 0.0016 and 0.0044 W kg(-1) in the slices. Measurements with a Luxtron fibreoptic probe confirmed that there was no detectable temperature change (+/- 0.1 degrees C) during a 15 min exposure to this field intensity. Furthermore, imposed temperature changes of up to 1 degrees C failed to mimic the effects of RF exposure. These results suggest that low-intensity RF fields can modulate the excitability of hippocampal tissue in vitro in the absence of gross thermal effects. The changes in excitability may be consistent with reported behavioural effects of RF fields.",Excluded

The rats were randomly divided into four equal groups. The control group did not receive melatonin or irradiation but received both 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally and sham irradiation. The irradiation (IR) group received 5 Gy gamma irradiation to the total cranium as a single dose plus 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally. The melatonin plus IR group received irradiation to the total cranium plus 5 mg/kg/day melatonin intraperitoneally. The melatonin group received only 5 mg/kg/day melatonin plus sham-irradiation. Biochemical parameters measured in murine lenses were carried out using spectrophotometric techniques.RESULTS: Lens antioxidant capacity, as measured by levels of total superoxide scavenger activity (TSSA), non-enzymatic superoxide scavenger activity (NSSA) and glutathione reductase (GRD) activity, significantly increased in melatonin, control and melatonin plus IR groups when compared with the IR group. Lens glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity significantly increased in control and melatonin groups when compared with the IR group.

The median apical and scleral tumour dose was 100 Gy (range 15-200 Gy) and 1000 Gy (range 200-1200 Gy), respectively. The median follow up time was 2.8 and 2.0 years (range 1 month to 10 years) for anterior and posterior segment complications, respectively.RESULTS: The 3 and 5 year probabilities of being without radiation cataract were 73% and 63%, without neovascular glaucoma 91% and 81%, without vitreous haemorrhage 83% and 74%, without radiation maculopathy 85% and 70%, and without radiation optic neuropathy 90% and 88%, respectively. The risk of radiation cataract was highest with large tumour size (T1 + T2 v T3, p = 0.0027; height < or = 5 v > 5 mm, p = 0.029; largest basal diameter (LBD) < or = 15 v > 15 mm, p < 0.0001) and location of anterior tumour margin anterior v posterior to the equator (p = 0.0003); the risk of neovascular glaucoma with large size (T1 + T2 v T3, p = 0.039; LBD < or = 15 mm v 15 mm, p = 0.021); and the risk of maculopathy and optic neuropathy with proximity of the posterior tumour margin to the fovea and the optic disc (< or = 1.5 v > 1.5 mm; p = 0.030 and p = 0.0004, respectively). In Cox's multivariate analysis the strongest risk indicator for radiation cataract (RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.6) and vitreous haemorrhage (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8) was the height of the tumour; for neovascular glaucoma the TNM class (RR 6.2, 95% CI 2.7-13.8); for radiation maculopathy location of posterior tumour margin within 2 mm from the fovea (RR 3.4, 95% CI 2.0-6.0); and for radiation optic neuropathy location of tumour margin within 1 DD of the optic disc (RR 6.1, 95% CI 3.0-12.4). The 3 and 5 year probabilities of avoiding enucleation were 92% and 85%, respectively. Ten eyes were enucleated--six because of recurrent tumour growth, three because of treatment complications, and one because of mistakenly suspected extraocular growth.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the frequency of radiation related complications after ruthenium brachytherapy of uveal melanoma is acceptable, in particular as regard irradiation of small and medium sized tumours for which ruthenium therapy generally is recommended.",Excluded
4277,"GABA-enhanced collective behavior in neuronal axons underlies persistent gamma-frequency oscillations Gamma (30-80 Hz) oscillations occur in mammalian electroencephalogram in a manner that indicates cognitive relevance. In vitro models of gamma oscillations demonstrate two forms of oscillation: one occurring transiently and driven by discrete afferent input and the second occurring persistently in response to activation of excitatory metabotropic receptors. The mechanism underlying persistent gamma oscillations has been suggested to involve gap-junctional communication between axons of principal neurons, but the precise relationship between this neuronal activity and the gamma oscillation has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that gamma oscillations coexist with high-frequency oscillations (>90 Hz). High-frequency oscillations can be generated in the axonal plexus even when it is physically isolated from pyramidal cell bodies. They were enhanced in networks by nonsomatic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<inf>A</inf>) receptor activation, were modulated by perisomatic GABA<inf>A</inf> receptor-mediated synaptic input to principal cells, and provided the phasic input to interneurons required to generate persistent gamma-frequency oscillations. The data suggest that high-frequency oscillations occurred as a consequence of random activity within the axonal plexus. Interneurons provide a mechanism by which this random activity is both amplified and organized into a coherent network rhythm.",Excluded
4419,"Passive avoidance learning and memory of 56Fe sham-irradiated and irradiated human apoE transgenic mice Cranial irradiation is associated with long-term cognitive impairments, including deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Not all people exposed to cranial radiation develop cognitive injury, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. There may also be sex differences in susceptibility to develop radiation-induced cognitive injury. The three major human apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms are encoded by distinct alleles (epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4). Compared with epsilon3, epsilon4 increases the risk of cognitive impairments following various challenges while epsilon2 provides relative protection. Women are at higher risk to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men, particularly those carrying epsilon4. In previous experiments using male and female mice expressing human apoE-isoforms E2, E3 or E4 under the mouse apoE promoter, we showed that cranial irradiation with 137Cs (10 Gy) results in hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments that are sex- and apoE-isoform dependent. 137Cs is a form of irradiation often used in the clinical setting.

3784,"Reverberation challenges the temporal representation of the pitch of complex sounds Accurate neural coding of the pitch of complex sounds is an essential part of auditory scene analysis; differences in pitch help segregate concurrent sounds, while similarities in pitch can help group sounds from a common source. In quiet, nonreverberant backgrounds, pitch can be derived from timing information in broadband high-frequency auditory channels and/or from frequency and timing information carried in narrowband low-frequency auditory channels. Recording from single neurons in the cochlear nucleus of anesthetized guinea pigs, we show that the neural representation of pitch based on timing information is severely degraded in the presence of reverberation. This degradation increases with both increasing reverberation strength and channel bandwidth. In a parallel human psychophysical pitch-discrimination task, reverberation impaired the ability to distinguish a high-pass harmonic sound from noise. Together, these findings explain the origin of perceptual difficulties experienced by both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners in reverberant spaces.",Excluded
4616,"Quantifying and improving the efficiency of Gamma Knife treatment plans for brain metastases: results of a 1-year audit OBJECT: A method for quantifying the efficiency of Gamma Knife treatment plans for metastases was previously implemented by the authors to retrospectively identify the least efficient plans and has provided insights into improved planning strategies. The aim of the current work was to ascertain whether those insights led to improved treatment plans.METHODS: Following completion of the initial study, a 1-year audit of metastasis plans created at St. James's Institute of Oncology was carried out. Audited recent plans were compared with the earlier plans of the initial study, in terms of their efficiency and dosimetric quality. The statistical significance of any differences between relevant plan parameters was quantified by Mann-Whitney U-tests. Comparisons were made between all plans and repeated for a reduced set of plans from which the smallest lesions treated with a single 4-mm shot were excluded. The plan parameters compared were a plan efficiency index (PEI), the number of shots, Paddick conformity index (PCI), gradient index (GI), and percent coverage (of the lesion by the prescription isodose).RESULTS: A total of 157 metastatic lesions were included in the audit and were compared with 241 in the initial study. In a comparison of all cases, the audited plans achieved a higher median PEI score than did the earlier plans from the initial study (1.08 vs 1.02), indicating improved efficiency of the audited plans. When the smallest lesions (for which there was little scope for varying plan strategy) were discounted, the improvement in median PEI score was greater (1.23 vs 1.03, p < 0.001). This improvement in efficiency corresponds to an estimated mean (maximum) time saving of 15% (66%) per lesion (11 minutes [64 minutes] on the day of treatment). The modified planning strategy yielding these efficiency improvements did not rely on the use of significantly fewer shots (median 11 vs 11 shots, p = 0.924), nor did it result in significant detriment to dosimetric quality (median coverage 99% vs 99%, median PCI 0.84 vs 0.83, p = 0.449, and median GI 2.72 vs 2.67, p = 0.701, audited plans vs initial plans, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Choice of planning strategy can substantially affect plan efficiency and thus strongly influence treatment time. Through increased emphasis on efficiency, resulting from the introduction of PEI combined with a modified planning strategy informed by previous work, it has been possible to reduce times for metastatic plans without compromising their dosimetric quality. Although the average time savings achieved per lesion are moderate, the potential benefits per patient are greater for those with multiple metastases. Reducing treatment times has clear benefits with regard to patient comfort and throughput. In addition, optimization of plan efficiency may potentially affect the biologically effective dose from Gamma Knife treatments and offers opportunity for further work.",Excluded
4469,"Postnatal development under conditions of simulated weightlessness and space flight The adaptability of the developing nervous system to environmental influences and the mechanisms underlying this plasticity has recently become a subject of interest in space neuroscience. Ground studies on neonatal rats using the tail suspension model of weightlessness have shown that the force of gravity clearly influences the events underlying the postnatal development of motor function. These effects depend on the age of the animal, duration of the perturbation and the motor function studied. A nine-day flight study has shown that a dam and neonates can develop under conditions of space flight. The motor function of the flight animals after landing was consistent with that seen in the tail suspension studies, being marked by limb joint extension. However, there were expected differences due to: (1) the unloading of the vestibular system in flight, which did not occur in the ground-based experiments; (2) differences between flight and suspension durations; and (3) the inability to evaluate motor function during the flight. The next step is to conduct experiments in space with the flexibility and rigor that is now limited to ground studies: an opportunity offered by the International Space Station.",Excluded

In 16 patients, whole brain was irradiated to a dose of 1000-4000 cGy. Their 6 month survival rate was 25% but all died within one year. In 24 patients, whole brain was first irradiated to 3000-4000 cGy. Then the dose was increased to 5000-6000 cGy by cone down technique. Their 6 month survival was 75%, 1 year survival 33%. The high-dose-cone down method is obviously more effective. In the other 5 patients who were retreated locally for recurrence or new foci in the other parts of the brain, their survival was 4 to 8 months taken from the start of the second course of radiotherapy. One of these five patients is still living as of this writing. Extensive brain necrosis was observed in three patients who received whole brain radiation in the second course. Yet untoward reactions were noted in the two patients who received local irradiation in the second course. This may imply that, for the second course, only local radiation is indicated.",Included

The objective of this study is to assess the HRQOL related to treatment regime and time since diagnosis in Dutch men with prostate cancer. We conducted a cross-sectional study among 238 men with prostate cancer in a heterogeneous sample who filled in a general health-related quality-of-life measure (EORTC-QLQ-C30) and a prostate cancer specific quality-of-life instrument (the EORTC-QLQ-PR25) and a Joy-of-Life questionnaire. Men on hormonal treatment are doing worse compared with other treatments with respect to physical functioning, role functioning, fatigue, pain and sexual functioning. No differences were found between radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy on any of the HRQOL dimensions nor for time since diagnosis. In hormonal therapy, men who are diagnosed longer than two years ago report a worse cognitive functioning and more burdens from urinary problems.",Excluded
4710,"Roles of DNA-dependent protein kinase and ATM in cell-cycle-dependent radiation sensitivity in human cells PURPOSE: The roles of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and ATM in the cell-cycle-dependent radiosensitivity in human cells were investigated.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A DNA-PK activity-deficient human glioblastoma cell line M059J, ataxia telangiectasia cell lines AT3BISV and AT5BIVA, and control cell lines were used. Wortmannin inhibited DNA-PK and ATM activities. Cells were synchronized by hydroxyurea. Progression through the cell cycle was analysed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: M059J exhibited hyper-radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle, with extreme hyper-radiosensitivity in G to early S-phase compared with the control cell line M059K. AT3BISV and AT5BIVA exhibited hyper-radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle but showed a similar pattern of cell-cycle-dependent radiosensitivity to that observed in LM217 or HeLa cells. In AT3BISV and AT5BIVA, radiosensitization by wortmannin was observed throughout the cell cycle and was most prominent in G1 to early S-phase. Wortmannin did not sensitize M059J to ionizing radiation in any cell-cycle phase. DNA-PK activities were not different throughout the cell cycle.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that (1) non-homologous endjoining plays a dominant role in G1 to early S-phase and a minor role in late S to G2-phase in repairing DNA double-strand breaks, (2) the role of ATM in repairing double-strand breaks may be almost cell-cycle-independent and (3) the dominant role of non-homologous end-joining during G1 to early S-phase is not due to cell-cycle-dependent fluctuations in DNA-PK activity.",Excluded
4146,"Genetic and physiological regulation of non-homologous end-joining in mammalian cells Repair of DSBs is important to prevent chromosomal fragmentation, translocations and deletions. To investigate the process in NHEJ, we have established an in vitro system to clarify the measurement and analysis of the efficiency and the fidelity of rejoining of DSBs, and applied the method to investigate NHEJ in human cells derived from patients suffering from cancer-prone hereditary diseases. A DSB was introduced in plasmid pZErO-2 at a specific site within the ccdB gene that is lethal to E. coli cells, and treated with nuclear extracts from human cells. The efficiency of rejoining in the nuclear extract from an A-T cell line was comparable to that from a control cell line. However, the accuracy of rejoining was much lower for the A-T cell extract than for the control cell extract. All mutations were deletions, most of which contained short direct repeats at the breakpoint junctions. The deletion spectrum caused by the A-T nuclear extract was distinct from that by the control extract. These results indicate that A-T cells have certain deficiencies in end-joining of double-strand breaks in DNA. The extract from BS cells also showed the similar activity and the lower fidelity of rejoing compared to that from normal cells. From the sequencing analysis of the junction of DSBs, it is speculated that the defect in the BLM helicase might cause irregular rejoining of DSBs. Radioadaptive response is the acquirement of cellular resistance to ionizing radiation by prior exposure to low dose. We investigated the in vitro end-joining activity of DNA ends in radioadaptive cells. Both the efficiency and the fidelity of rejoining in the cells pre-exposed to low dose are increased comparing to those without pre-exposure. We also investigated the joining activity of DNA ends in p53-deficient cells. Pre-irradiation caused no apparent alteration in both the efficiency and fidelity of end-joining. These results suggest that the exposure to low dose activates a cellular function to repair DSBs efficiently, which is dependent on p53. These results indicate that NHEJ pathway is regulated by many factors; genetic regulation by ATM and BLM, and physiological conditions such as irradiation with ionizing radiation. The observations also suggest that in some occasions p53 might play a key role in NHEJ. [References: 103]",Excluded
3845,"An unusual and terminal cause of syncope LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: To recognize that aggressive orophyrangeal squamous cell cancer can lead to syncope LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: To appreciate a clinical scenario in which evaluation of carotid arteries is an appropriate part of syncope work up CASE: 63 year old male with history of locally advanced ((T4 - deep muscle invasion, N2b - multiple ipsilateral neck lymph nodes, M0), left sided base of tongue squamous cell cancer presented to the emergency room with multiple episodes syncope over 2-3 weeks. He was treated with chemoradiation 6 months prior to current admission. Follow up imaging after chemoradiation showed progressive disease. He was then started on palliative cetuximab 1 month prior to current admission. During current admission, work up for syncope was commenced. EKG and cardiac enzymes were negative. There were no events on telemetry. Review of his last CT scan from 4 months prior to admission showed encasement of left carotid artery. A repeat CT scan of his neck was performed. It showed remarkable tumor progression with extensive lymphadenopathy and compression of both of his carotid arteries by a combination of tumor burden, lymph nodes and post-radiation edema. Surgical resection of the mass and local radiation therapy were both deemed inappropriate due to location of tumor and its relative radioresistance in the past. In addition, there was concern that radiation could cause worsening edema and precipitous worsening of patient's condition by causing complete occlusion of the carotid arteries. This information was discussed with patient and his wife and he is currently in home hospice. In the 2 weeks since discharge, he feels he has been able to minimize further episodes of syncope by limiting and modifying his activities. DISCUSSION: Recurrent syncope due to malignancy is uncommon. Head and neck cancer can lead to recurrent syncope by two mechanisms. Neurally mediated syncope can occur due to carotid body invasion or involvement of the vagus nerve. Syncope due to reduced blood flow in carotid arteries is uncommon and requires involvement of both carotids. While it is possible that our patient was passing out due to tumor pressure mediated firing of baroreceptors in his carotid bodies, we think reduced carotid blood flow was the more likely culprit. This is based upon the fact that he only started having syncopal events after involvement of his contralateral carotid artery. Finally, our case highlights the importance of imaging the carotid arteries in patients with history of head and neck cancer who present with syncope. Imaging of carotid arteries is not merited during routine diagnostic work up of syncope unless a neurological event is suggested by history or if focal signs and symptoms are present. However, such an evaluation should be considered in patients who have a history of head and neck cancer, especially if the cancer has been relatively resistant to treatment or locally advanced in the past.",Excluded

The extent of retinal damage was determined histologically. Daily exposure to bright light in the morning produced greater photoreceptor loss than daily afternoon exposure. Severe retinal damage was partially prevented by brief light adaptation (20 minutes duration, at 1.4 log ftc intensity) before the onset of morning exposure. However, light adaptation did not remove the differential effect of time of day. The authors conclude that increased light exposure during the period of rod outer segment phagocytosis enhances photoreceptor damage.",Excluded

3863,"Palmitoylation is a prerequisite for dimerization-dependent raftophilicity of rhodopsin The visual photopigment rhodopsin (Rh) is a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) responsible for initiation of the phototransduction cascade in rod photoreceptors. Similar to other GPCRs, Rh can form dimers or even higher oligomers and tends to have a supramolecular organization that is likely important in the dim light response. Rh also exhibits high affinity for lipid rafts (i.e. raftophilicity) upon light-dependent binding with the cognate G protein transducin (G<sub>t</sub>), suggesting the presence of lipid raft-like domains in the retinal disk membrane and their importance in phototransduction. However, the relationship between Rh oligomerization and lipid rafts in the disk membrane remains to be explored. Given previous findings that G<sub>t</sub> binds to dimeric Rh and that Rh is posttranslationally modified with two highly raftophilic palmitoyl moieties, we hypothesized that Rh becomes raftophilic upon dimerization. Here, using biochemical assays, we found that Rh*-G<sub>t</sub> complexes in the detergent-resistant membrane are partially resistant to cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and that the Rh-to-G<sub>t</sub> stoichiometry in this methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-resistant complex is 2:1. Next, we found that IgG-mediated Rh-Rh cross-linking renders Rh highly raftophilic, supporting the premise that Rh becomes raftophilic upon dimerization. Rh depalmitoylation via reduction of thioester linkages blocked the translocation of IgG-cross-linked Rh to the detergent-resistant membrane, highlighting that the two palmitoyl moieties are important for the dimerization-dependent raftophilicity of Rh. These results indicate that palmitoylated GPCRs such as Rh can acquire raftophilicity upon G protein-stabilized dimerization and thereby organize receptor-cluster rafts by recruiting raftophilic lipids.",Excluded

APBI was delivered using 3-dimensional CRT (n = 29) or with SAVI (n = 176), Contura (n = 56), or MammoSite (n = 20) brachytherapy catheters. Patients were evaluated at protocol-specified intervals, at which time the radiation oncologist scored cosmetic outcome, toxicities, and recurrence status using a standardized template.RESULTS: The median follow-up time is 41 months. Grade 1 seroma and fibrosis were more common with brachytherapy than with 3-dimensional CRT (50.4% vs 3.4% for seroma; P < .0001 and 66.3% vs 44.8% for fibrosis; P = .02), but grade 1 edema was more common with 3-dimensional CRT than with brachytherapy (17.2% vs 5.6%; P = .04). Grade 2 to 3 pain was more common with 3-dimensional CRT (17.2% vs 5.2%; P = .03). Actuarial 5-year rates of fair or poor radiation oncologist-reported cosmetic outcome were 9% for 3-dimensional CRT and 24% for brachytherapy (P = .13). Brachytherapy was significantly associated with inferior cosmesis on mixed model analysis (P = .003). Significant predictors of reduced risk of adverse cosmetic outcome after brachytherapy were D0.1cc (skin) <=102%, minimum skin distance >5.1 mm, dose homogeneity index >0.54, and volume of nonconformance <=0.89 cc. The 5-year ipsilateral breast recurrence was 4.3% for brachytherapy and 4.2% for 3-dimensional CRT APBI patients (P = .95).CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy APBI is associated with higher rates of grade 1 fibrosis and seroma than 3-dimensional CRT but lower rates of grade 1 edema and grade 2 to 3 pain than 3-dimensional CRT.

4448,"Defining the mechanisms that underlie cortical hyperexcitability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS] is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder of motor neurons, heralded by the development of cortical hyperexcitability. Reduction of short interval intracortical inhibition [SICI] in ALS, a feature linked to the development of cortical hyperexcitability, may be mediated by degeneration of inhibitory circuits or alternatively activation of high threshold excitatory circuits. As such, determining the mechanisms of SICI reduction in ALS has clear diagnostic and therapeutic significance. Consequently, the present study utilized a novel threshold tracking paired-pulse paradigm to determine whether SICI reduction in ALS represented reduced inhibition or excessive excitation. Using a 90 mm circular coil, SICI was assessed at three different conditioning stimulus intensities: 40%, 70% and 90% of resting motor threshold [RMT]. Motor evoked potential responses were recorded over the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. Short interval intracortical inhibition was uniformly reduced across all three levels of conditioning intensities in ALS [40% RMT, ALS -0.6+/-0.7%, controls 2.0+/-0.6%, P<0.01; 70% RMT, ALS 0.6+/-2.7%, controls 12.8+/-2%, P<0.001; 90% RMT, ALS -15.9+/-1.3%, controls 2.2+/-4.1%, P<0.01]. In addition, the resting motor threshold was reduced, while the motor evoked potential amplitude was increased in ALS patients, in keeping with cortical hyperexcitability. These findings establish that SICI reduction in ALS represents degeneration of inhibitory cortical circuits, combined with excessive excitation of high threshold excitatory pathways. Neuroprotective strategies aimed at preserving the integrity of intracortical inhibitory circuits, in addition to antagonizing excitatory cortical circuits, may provide novel therapeutic targets in ALS.",Excluded

Studies suggest that cranial irradiation might impact on pineal melatonin secretion. Melatonin is an important regulator in human circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle. The objective of this study was to investigate melatonin secretion, subjective sleep parameters and their interplay in a cohort of cranially irradiated head and brain tumour and leukaemia survivors at least 3 years after radiotherapy. Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Patient(s): Thirty-eight adults. Measurements: Melatonin secretion was evaluated by measuring its metabolite 6-sulphatoxymelatonin in collected overnight urine. Subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The Beck Depression Inventory II was used to screen for depressive symptoms because of their impact on sleep. Result(s): Patients irradiated in the brain midline had significantly lower melatonin secretion (P = 0.008). Subjects exhibited a high prevalence of sleeping difficulties, daytime sleepiness and depression, with females and overweight subjects particularly affected. Melatonin values and subjective sleep parameters did not correlate with each other or with treatment and most patient variables. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that radiation exposure to the pineal gland negatively affects melatonin secretion. This lack of pineal melatonin does not influence subjective sleep quality. As melatonin has important antioxidant and cancer-protective effects, further research is necessary to elucidate whether these patients have an increased risk of developing secondary neoplasms and other radiation late effects.

In this work we demonstrate the proof of principle of segmented magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided attenuation and scatter corrections in three-dimensional (3D) brain PET. We have developed a method for attenuation correction based on registered T1-weighted MRI, eliminating the need of an additional transmission (TX) scan. The MR images were realigned to preliminary reconstructions of PET data using an automatic algorithm and then segmented by means of a fuzzy clustering technique which identifies tissues of significantly different density and composition. The voxels belonging to different regions were classified into air, skull, brain tissue and nasal sinuses. These voxels were then assigned theoretical tissue-dependent attenuation coefficients as reported in the ICRU 44 report followed by Gaussian smoothing and addition of a good statistics bed image. The MRI-derived attenuation map was then forward projected to generate attenuation correction factors (ACFs) to be used for correcting the emission (EM) data. The method was evaluated and validated on 10 patient data where TX and MRI brain images were available. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of differences between TX-guided and segmented MRI-guided 3D reconstructions were performed by visual assessment and by estimating parameters of clinical interest. The results indicated a small but noticeable improvement in image quality as a consequence of the reduction of noise propagation from TX into EM data. Considering the difficulties associated with preinjection TX-based attenuation correction and the limitations of current calculated attenuation correction, MRI-based attenuation correction in 3D brain PET would likely be the method of choice for the foreseeable future as a second best approach in a busy nuclear medicine center and could be applied to other functional brain imaging modalities such as SPECT.",Excluded

Mean neuropsychometric results of treatment groups were significantly worse than those of matched controls.CONCLUSIONS: Although more intensively treated patients showed more neurologic impairment and patients in group 3 had more white matter abnormalities, there was no statistic evidence for additional neurotoxicity of PCI. Marked neuropsychometric differences between patients and matched controls may indicate that cognitive impairment is partly disease related, probably due to emotional distress and deteriorated physical condition.",Excluded
3984,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation in extensive disease small-cell lung cancer: Short-term health-related quality of life and patient reported symptoms-results of an international phase III randomized controlled trial by the EORTC radiation oncology and lung cancer groups Purpose Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients with extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) leads to significantly fewer symptomatic brain metastases and improved survival. Detailed effects of PCI on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are reported here. Patients and Methods Patients (age, 18 to 75 years; WHO <= 2) with ED-SCLC, and any response to chemotherapy, were randomly assigned to either observation or PCI. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and patient-reported symptoms were secondary end points. The European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer core HRQOL tool (Quality of Life Questionnaire C30) and brain module (Quality of Life Questionnaire Brain Cancer Module) were used to collect self-reported patient data. Six HRQOL scales were selected as primary HRQOL end points: global health status; hair loss; fatigue; and role, cognitive and emotional functioning. Assessments were performed at random assignment, 6 weeks, 3 months, and then 3-monthly up to 1 year and 6-monthly thereafter. Results Compliance with the HRQOL assessment was 93.7% at baseline and dropped to 60% at 6 weeks. Short-term results up to 3 months showed that there was a negative impact of PCI on selected HROOL scales. The largest mean difference between the two arms was observed for fatigue and hair loss. The impact of PCI on global health status as well as on functioning scores was more limited. For global health status, the observed mean difference was eight points on a scale 0 to 100 at 6 weeks (P = .018) and 3 months (P = .055). Conclusion PCI should be offered to all responding ED SCLC patients. Patients should be informed of the potential adverse effects from PCI. Clinicians should be alert to these; monitor their patients; and offer appropriate support, clinical, and psychosocial care. Â©2008 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded

Cyclic light levels as low as 133 and 320 lux were found to destroy photoreceptor cells. A single mydriatic treatment with atropine immediately preceding the three-day exposure was sufficient to permit the effect in pigmented rats. No mydriasis was required for albino rats. When pigmented rats were reared in either 3 lux or 100 lux, it was found that these different light histories did not significantly affect the rats' subsequent susceptibility, during mydriasis, to retinal damage by cyclic illumination.",Excluded
4461,"Repeat intracoronary radiation for recurrent in-stent restenosis in patients who failed intracoronary radiation BACKGROUND: Intracoronary radiation therapy (IRT) is the only proven treatment for in-stent restenosis (ISR). It is, however, associated with a significant failure rate. The present study evaluated the outcomes of patients who underwent repeat intracoronary radiation for recurrent ISR.METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-one consecutive patients who failed a previous radiation treatment, presented with angina and angiographic evidence of ISR, and were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and repeat radiation to the same segment were studied. Twenty-five patients were treated with gamma radiation in a dose of 15 Gy, and 26 were treated with beta radiation doses of 18.3 to 23 Gy. The mean cumulative dose for this cohort was 39.5+/-11.9 Gy (range, 29 to 75.6 Gy). The outcomes of those patients were compared with outcomes of 299 patients who also failed initial radiation but were treated with repeat conventional PCI to a previously irradiated segment without repeat radiation. At 9 months after treatment, the repeat-IRT group had lower rates of target lesion revascularization (23.5% versus 54.6%; P<0.001) and major adverse cardiac events, including target vessel revascularization (29.4% versus 61.3%; P<0.001). At 9 months, patients with repeat IRT were free of angiographic and clinical events related to the radiation therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Repeat gamma or beta radiation to treat failed IRT for ISR after conventional PCI is safe and effective at 9 months and should be considered as a therapeutic option for this difficult patient subset.",Excluded

4787,"Changes in the readily releasable pool of transmitter and in efficacy of release induced by high-frequency firing at Aplysia sensorimotor synapses in culture Synaptic transmission at the sensory neuron-motor neuron synapses of Aplysia, like transmission at many synapses of both vertebrates and invertebrates, is increased after a short burst of high-frequency stimulation (HFS), a phenomenon known as posttetanic potentiation (PTP). PTP is generally attributable to an increase in transmitter release from presynaptic neurons. We investigated whether changes in the readily releasable pool of transmitter (RRP) contribute to the potentiation that follows HFS. We compared the changes in excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked with action potentials to changes in the RRP as estimated from the asynchronous transmitter release elicited by a hypertonic solution. The changes in the EPSP were correlated with changes in the RRP, but the changes matched quantitatively only at connections whose initial synaptic strength was greater than the median for all experiments. At weaker connections, the increase in the RRP was insufficient to account for PTP. Weaker connections initially released a smaller fraction of the RRP with each EPSP than stronger ones, and this fraction increased at weaker connections after HFS. Moreover, the initial transmitter release in response to the hypertonic solution was accelerated after HFS, indicating that the increase in the efficacy of release was not restricted to excitation-secretion coupling. Modulation of the RRP and of the efficacy of release thus both contribute to the enhancement of transmitter release by HFS.",Excluded

Here we show that these lesions can be distinguished using the amide proton transfer (APT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals of endogenous cellular proteins and peptides as an imaging biomarker. When comparing two models of orthotopic glioma (SF188/V+ glioma and 9L gliosarcoma) with a model of radiation necrosis in rats, we could clearly differentiate viable glioma (hyperintense) from radiation necrosis (hypointense to isointense) by APT MRI. When we irradiated rats with U87MG gliomas, the APT signals in the irradiated tumors had decreased substantially by 3 d and 6 d after radiation. The amide protons that can be detected by APT provide a unique and noninvasive MRI biomarker for distinguishing viable malignancy from radiation necrosis and predicting tumor response to therapy.",Excluded
3715,"Correlation between fissured fibrous cap and contrast enhancement: preliminary results with the use of CTA and histologic validation BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies demonstrated that carotid plaques analyzed by CTA can show contrast plaque enhancement. The purpose of this preliminary work was to evaluate the possible association between the fissured fibrous cap and contrast plaque enhancement.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven consecutive (men = 25; average age = 66.8 +/- 9 years) symptomatic patients studied by use of a multidetector row CT scanner were prospectively analyzed. CTA was performed before and after contrast and radiation doses were recorded; analysis of contrast plaque enhancement was performed. Patients underwent carotid endarterectomy en bloc; histologic sections were prepared and evaluated for fissured fibrous cap and microvessel attenuation. The Mann-Whitney test was performed to evaluate the differences between the 2 groups. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of fissured fibrous cap and microvessel attenuation on contrast plaque enhancement. Receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were also calculated.RESULTS: Twelve patients had fissured fibrous cap. In 92% (11/12) of fissured fibrous cap-positive plaques, we found contrast plaque enhancement, whereas in 69% (24/35) of the plaques without fissured fibrous cap contrast plaque enhancement was found. The Mann-Whitney test showed a statistically significant difference between the contrast enhancement in plaques with fissured fibrous cap (Hounsfield units = 22.6) and without fissured fibrous cap (Hounsfield units = 12.9) (P = .011). On the regression analysis, both fissured fibrous cap and neovascularization were associated with contrast plaque enhancement (P = .0366 and P = .0001). The receiver operating characteristic curve confirmed an association between fissured fibrous cap and contrast plaque enhancement with an area under the curve of 0.749 (P = .005).CONCLUSIONS: The presence of fissured fibrous cap is associated with contrast plaque enhancement. Histologic analysis showed that the presence of fissured fibrous cap is associated with a larger contrast plaque enhancement compared with the contrast plaque enhancement of plaques without fissured fibrous cap.",Excluded
4035,"Atm knock-in mice harboring an in-frame deletion corresponding to the human ATM 7636del9 common mutation exhibit a variant phenotype ATM, the gene mutated in the human immunodeficiency disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), plays a central role in recognizing ionizing radiation damage in DNA and in controlling several cell cycle checkpoints. We describe here a murine model in which a nine-nucleotide in-frame deletion has been introduced into the Atm gene by homologous recombination followed by removal of the selectable marker cassette by Cre-loxP site-specific, recombination-mediated excision. This mouse, Atm-DeltaSRI, was designed as a model of one of the most common deletion mutations (7636del9) found in A-T patients. The murine Atm deletion results in the loss of three amino acid residues (SRI; 2556-2558) but produces near full-length detectable Atm protein that lacks protein kinase activity. Radiosensitivity was observed in Atm-DeltaSRI mice, whereas the immunological profile of these mice showed greater heterogeneity of T-cell subsets than observed in Atm(-/-) mice. The life span of Atm-DeltaSRI mice was significantly longer than that of Atm(-/-) mice when maintained under nonspecific pathogen-free conditions. This can be accounted for by a lower incidence of thymic lymphomas in Atm-DeltaSRI mice up to 40 weeks, after which time the animals died of other causes. The thymic lymphomas in Atm-DeltaSRI mice were characterized by extensive apoptosis, which appears to be attributable to an increased number of cells expressing Fas ligand. A variety of other tumors including B-cell lymphomas, sarcomas, and carcinomas not seen in Atm(-/-) mice were observed in older Atm-DeltaSRI animals. Thus, expression of mutant protein in Atm-DeltaSRI knock-in mice gives rise to a discernibly different phenotype to Atm(-/-) mice, which may account for the heterogeneity seen in A-T patients with different mutations.",Excluded

To study the characteristics of EEG after transient ischemic attack and to offer reference for screening procedure of aircrew and astronaut selection. Method. The dominant frequency uncertainty of alpha band EEG in 12 pilots (males; age 30 +/- 5) with transient ischemic episodes in middle cerebral artery (MCA) territories and in 20 normal healthy pilots was analyzed with frequency-fluctuation analysis. Result. The dominant probability of the main frequency coinciding with sites affected by transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patient pilots was higher than that in healthy pilots (P<0.01), and the dominant probability ratio logarithmic index I >or= 0 in all patient pilots with normal EEG, but I<0 in all healthy pilots. It was also found that not only I >or= 0, but the second component shifted to lower frequency (8 Hz) in patients with slight focal EEG alterations, i.e. slowing of frequency. The relative entropy values (percentage) were decreased significantly in pilots with TIA as compared with healthy pilots (P<0.05). Conclusion .

Studies of human breast cancer samples and cell lines suggest a putative role of TACC2 as a tumor suppressor protein. To analyze the physiological role of TACC2, we generated mice lacking TACC2. TACC2-deficient mice are viable, develop normally, are fertile, and lack phenotypic changes compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, TACC2 deficiency does not lead to an increased incidence of tumor development. Finally, in TACC2-deficient embryonic fibroblasts, proliferation and cell cycle progression as well as centrosome numbers are comparable to those in wild-type cells. Therefore, TACC2 is not required, nonredundantly, for mouse development and normal cell proliferation and is not a tumor suppressor protein.",Excluded

Numerous studies worldwide yielded variable results ranging from ineffectivity to an efficacy rate of more than 50 % for the reduction of depressive symptoms. A comparison of the effectiveness of TMS across studies is difficult due to the variety of chosen stimulation parameters, different inclusion criteria, and different designs. The discrepancies in results could be partially in account to these factors. From a pathophysiological point of view, there are no empirically justified parameters published carrying out an antidepressant TMS. Further studies are required to find optimal stimulation parameters using complementary methods like functional imaging techniques or regarding other factors that could interfere with its efficacy. An overview of studies published in the last ten years, a critical analysis of stimulation procedures and protocols, and possible future perspectives of this method are reviewed in this article.

New information indicates that it confers a survival benefit for limited or extensive stage SCLC patients gaining a complete response in the chest. A review of causes of cerebral dysfunction as a complication indicates that such problems can be due to suboptimal radiation fractionation, chemotherapy, or an inappropriate combination of prophylactic brain irradiation with chemotherapy. Optimum treatment with prophylactic brain irradiation has been shown not to cause adverse effects with detailed psychometric testing. Several additional sources of information can be drawn together to suggest a dose-response pattern for prophylactic brain irradiation, leading to the recommendation that a dose of 25-36 Gy is optimal, delivered in 2-3 Gy daily fractions after the completion of chest irradiation and chemotherapy.

4409,"Biochemical and clinical aspects of methotrexate neurotoxicity Acute, subacute and chronic neurotoxicity have been observed after the administration of high-dose and/or intrathecal methotrexate (MTX). Acute toxicity is usually transient without permanent damage. Subacute and chronic toxicity are associated with changes in the brain and/or the spinal cord which may be progressive and even lead to coma and death in severe cases. It is believed that MTX can induce direct toxic effects to the CNS by damaging the neuronal tissue. Moreover, MTX interferes with the metabolic pathways of folates, excitatory amino acids, homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine, adenosine and biopterins, inducing biochemical alterations which have been associated with neurotoxic symptoms. It has been suggested that acute toxicity is partly mediated by adenosine, whereas homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine, excitatory amino acids and biopterins may play an important role in the development of subacute and chronic toxicity. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of MTX neurotoxicity would offer the possibility of developing new therapeutic strategies for its treatment or prevention. Copyright Â© 2003 S.

In recent years, it was found that a Y-90 PET scan can be acquired to determine the distribution of microspheres after their administration. While the obvious advantage of PET is better resolution than Bremsstrahlung imaging, the other great advantage of quantitative assessment is just beginning to be exploited. Method(s): In this retrospective study, 57 patients with HCC, which included 101 distinct tumors, were analyzed after Y-90 microsphere treatment in order to evaluate the dose of radiation delivered to liver tumors as well as to normal liver tissue. Using Y-90 PET/CT and triphasic liver CT scans in conjunction with commercially available imaging software, we were able to contour tumor and normal liver regions treated by Y-90 radioembolization and determine the specific activities (Bq/mL) for treated tumor and normal liver tissue. An absorbed dose factor, taking into account isotope branching ratios and decay was calculated through a phantom experiment. This factor was used to convert the specific activities (Bq/mL) of normal and malignant liver tissue to an absorbed dose (Gy). Result(s): The analysis suggests that the mean dose received among the 101 studied tumors was 166.45 Gy with a mode of 90-120 Gy and a treatment dose range of 0-570 Gy. Normal liver tissue in the 57 cases evaluated received a mean dose of 66.25 Gy with a mode of 60-70 Gy and a range of 10-120 Gy. Conclusion(s): This data demonstrates that the Y-90 dose to liver tumors after radioembolization is fairly similar to the brachytherapy dose used to treat other cancers. This also shows that the normal liver tissue may receive a dose which is nontrivial and have some real biological effects for the patient. This study is among the first to systematically showa method for quantitative dose assessment using Y-90 PET. These methods in the future can provide the tools to help understand whether patient adverse events, treatment success, or treatment failure can be attributed to the dose which the tumor or normal liver received.",Excluded

We investigated the effects of serotonin (5-HT) on firing rates of light-activated SCN cells in urethane-anesthetized hamsters. Micro-iontophoretic application of 5-HT or 5-HT1A agonists (8-OH-DPAT and 5-CT) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of spontaneous activity and photic responses in the majority of SCN cells tested. Application of metergoline alone, a non-selective 5-HT antagonist, slightly increased firing rates during darkness and light exposure, suggesting a tonic serotonergic suppression of SCN activity. Metergoline also effectively attenuated suppression induced by the three 5-HT agonists. In addition, the effects of 8-OH-DPAT were blocked by a 5-HT1A antagonist, SDZ 216-525. However, other putative 5-HT antagonists were weak (propranolol and NAN-190) or ineffective (ketanserin) in blocking the action of 8-OH-DPAT.

4768,"Risk factors of brain metastases as initial failure for completely resected stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer Purpose/Objective(s): Brain metastasis (BM) is the main sign of failure of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). The lymph node (LN) status is a major determinant of outcome in patients with NSCLC, but whether or not the LN status is a major determinant of BM remains unclear. In the present study, we focused on completely resected staged IIIA (N2) LA-NSCLC to explore the correlation between LN status and BM. We also aimed to identify the risk factors of BM as the initial site of failure, as well as the potential highest-risk candidates who are most likely to benefit from prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Materials/Methods: The medical records of 357 consecutive patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC who underwent complete surgery were reviewed between January 2005 and June 2012. Time to BM as the initial site of failure was measured from the date of surgery to the date of BM in the patients who developed distant metastases or both local and distant recurrence as the initial failure, with BM defined as an event. The cumulative incidence of BM as the initial site of failure and survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. To assess the risk factors of BM, the log-rank test was used for univariate analysis, and Cox regression was used for multivariate analysis. Result(s): A total of 73 (20.4%) patients developed BM, and 60 patients had BM as their initial site of failure. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year risks for patients developing BM as the initial site of failure were 9.1%, 27.4%, and 35.4%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that non-squamous cell cancer (P = 0.000), positive extra-capsular extension of LN metastasis (P=0.041), number of metastatic LN > 4 (P = 0.018), multiple N2 stations (P = 0.027), and multiple regions of mediastinal LN (MLN) involvement (P = 0.010) were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing BM as the initial site of failure. Multivariate analysis showed that non-squamous cell cancer (P = 0.002; HR = 5.148; 95% CI = 1.863-14.222) and multiple regions of MLN involvement (P = 0.015; HR = 0.556; 95% CI = 0.326-0.948) were significantly associated with the high risk of BM as the initial site of failure. In patients with nonsquamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement, the fiveyear actuarial risk of BM as the initial failure was 47.6%. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated that non-squamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement were independent risk factors for BM as the initial failure in completely resected IIIA (N2) NSCLC. Patients with non-squamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement are at the highest risk of developing BM as the initial failure, and may receive a greater benefit from PCI.

However, the underlying mechanisms and targets of thyroid hormone action are not well defined. To identify embryonic roles for thyroid hormone we tested for effects on a key neuronal trait, voltage-gated sodium current (I(Na)), in the zebrafish model system. We recorded from Rohon-Beard sensory neurons (RBs) using whole cell voltage-clamp methods. Here, we provide in vivo evidence for thyroid hormone regulation of I(Na). Chronic thyroid hormone application increased RB peak I(Na) density 1.4-fold. However, I(Na) density showed a similar increase within 5 min of an acute hormone application, a time course not expected for a genomic mechanism. Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), a thyroid hormone blocker, blocked both chronic and acute effects. Further, the thyroid hormone precursor thyroxine (T4) affected I(Na), yet the traditionally active form triiodothyronine did not. Consequently, we tested for a nonconventional T4 receptor. LM609, a selective antagonist of integrin alphaVbeta3, occluded the rapid effect of T4, implicating a specific integrin dimer as a T4 receptor. Chronic application of either tetrac or LM609 significantly reduced sodium conductance, demonstrating an in vivo requirement for T4-integrin regulation of I(Na). Further, removing endogenous T4 levels via yolkectomy reduced sodium conductance, an effect that was partially rescued by T4 supplementation following surgery. Because RBs mediate the embryonic touch response, we tested for behavioral effects. Tetrac and LM609 significantly reduced the percentage of touch trials eliciting a normal touch response. T4's rapid effect on RB I(Na) highlights the importance of embryonic T4 availability and nongenomic T4 signaling.",Excluded

Down regulation of glutathione (GSH) by buthionine sulfoximine in cultured cells resulted in increase of BSH uptake (7.9-36.5%) compared to the control group and consequently the cytocidal effect of neutron irradiation also increased.

The goal of this study was to review the treatment duration, toxicity, and survival for patients treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiation. Methods Women with stage III-IV endometrial cancer treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation between 2006 and 2013 were included. Toxicities were classified per CTCAE v3.0 and RTOG/EORTC late radiation morbidity scoring. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify treatment and toxicities. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival. Results Fifty-one patients met our inclusion criteria. Median age was 60 (range 33-85). Thirty-six patients (70.6%) had endometrioid histology, 13 patients (25.5%) had serous, clear cell, or mixed histology, and 2 women (3.9%) had carcinosarcoma. Forty-eight patients had stage III disease and three patients were stage IVB. Mean treatment duration was 107 +/- 19 days. Forty-two patients received all planned chemotherapy, and 16 patients required a dose reduction. Thirty-four patients (66.7%) experienced grade 3-4 toxicities, the majority of which were hematologic. There were no deaths related to therapy. Eighty-six percent of patients received leukocyte growth factors, and 25% of patients received a blood transfusion.

Objective(s): To provide information on long-Term outcomes that would facilitate establishment of the optimal management strategy for thyroid lymphoma. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): Medical records of 107 patients (median age 67 years, 20 males, 87 females) who were diagnosed with localized thyroid MALT lymphoma stage IE or IIE at Ito Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Main Outcome Measure(s): Overall and event-free survival (EFS). Result(s): Initial treatments included radiation therapy (RT) alone (n = 58), combined modality therapy (CMT) (n = 48), or chemotherapy alone (n = 1). All 107 patients responded to the treatment, six of whom experienced relapse. Only one patient died of lymphoma. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and EFS rates were 94% [95% confidence interval (CI), 87% to 97%] and 92% (95% CI, 85% to 95%), respectively, and the 10-year OS and EFS rates were 91% (95% CI, 83% to 95%) and 84% (95% CI, 74% to 90%), respectively. Of the 106 patients with information available on adverse events, 71 patients (67%) developed hypothyroidism after primary thyroid lymphoma treatment. The CMT group showed additional chemotherapy-induced adverse reactions in the form of neutropenia, neuropathy, constipation, and pneumonia. The 5-year OS rates of patients treated with CMT and RT were 93% (95% CI, 81% to 98%) and 94% (95% CI, 84% to 98%), respectively. Conclusion(s): Long-Term outcomes of localized thyroid MALT lymphoma are favorable with all initial treatment modalities. Copyright Â© 2018 Endocrine Society.",Excluded

3846,"Changes in olfactory inputs modify the energy balance response to short days in male gray mouse lemurs The role of olfaction/olfactory cues on photoperiodic responses was assessed in Malagasy primate, the gray mouse lemur. When exposed to short photoperiod (SP), this primate demonstrates rapid changes in energy balance as adaptive anticipatory response for winter survival. To follow early changes induced by SP exposure, body mass, food intake, resting metabolism (RMR) and free thyroxin levels in plasma (T4) were measured in males abruptly transferred to SP: six intact males (controls), eight males that underwent bilateral olfactory removal (BOX) and eight males exposed to male urinary cues (U-exposed). To assess the effect of SP exposure, two other groups were maintained for 6 weeks under LP: six controls and six BOX males. Whereas all studied parameters remained constant in controls and BOX males maintained under LP, exposure to SP led to different responses according to groups. In controls, SP exposure led to a regular increase in body mass and after 4 weeks under SP, plasma T4 levels, food consumption and RMR significantly decreased. Even if BOX males demonstrated hyperphagic patterns regardless of the photoperiod, an increase in body mass was also induced by SP exposure but without changes in RMR or food intake that were body mass-dependent. In U-exposed males, body mass gain was significantly reduced while food intake and RMR remained high. In both BOX and U-exposed males, SP exposure led to a transient but high increase in T4 levels compared to controls. These results suggest that olfaction/olfactory cues may delay the SP-mediated changes in energy balance.",Excluded
3996,"Duration of fluoroscopic-guided spine interventions and radiation exposure is increased in overweight patients BACKGROUND: The impact of patient body mass index (BMI) on image-guided spine interventions remains unknown. Higher BMI is known to complicate the acquisition of radiographic images. Therefore it can be hypothesized that the patient's body habitus can influence the delivery of a spinal injection.OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of patient BMI on the length of fluoroscopy and procedure times during spine interventions.DESIGN: Secondary analysis of 2 prospective observational studies.SETTING: All injections were performed in an outpatient university setting.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 209 patients in whom spine injections were performed (99 women), with a mean age of 54.6 years.METHODS: The fluoroscopy times for 202 participants and total procedure times for 137 participants were recorded. Additional participant characteristics, including age, gender, BMI, and actual procedures performed, also were collected. Analysis of covariance and linear and nonlinear model analysis were performed to assess the effect of BMI on fluoroscopy and procedure times.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Fluoroscopy time and procedure duration times.RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 54.6 years, 51% were men, and 77% (n = 155) were overweight (BMI >=25). Participants received the following interventions: 40 zygapophyseal joint injections, 33 medial branch nerve blocks, 113 transforaminal epidural injections, and 16 combined zygapophyseal joint injections and epidural injections. Gender, procedure number, and procedure type did not differ between groups. The overweight group demonstrated a 30% increase in mean fluoroscopy time and a 35% increase in mean procedure time. Controlling for other variables, we found that differences in fluoroscopy time and procedure time were significant (P = .032 and P = .031, respectively) between the 2 groups.CONCLUSIONS: Significantly prolonged procedure time and fluoroscopy time in overweight patients increase the risks associated with spine interventions, not only to the patients but also to the operating room staff exposed to ionizing radiation.",Excluded
4611,"Analyzing the response to metabolic therapy in a mouse model of malignant glioma using multimodality imaging The ketogenic diet (KD) is a therapeutic high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that alters metabolism by increasing the level of ketone bodies in the blood. We have used a bioluminescent intracranial mouse model of malignant glioma and the IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, a PerkinElmer Co, Hopkinton, MA) to demonstrate that a rodent ketogenic diet given ad libitum increases blood ketones without altering animal weight or overall blood glucose levels. Animals maintained on a KD have extended survival following tumor implantation, and the KD potentiates the therapeutic effects of radiation and chemotherapy. We previously demonstrated in vivo that these tumors cause a local increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), but the KD reduced ROS in the tumor when quantitatively analyzed ex vivo. We now hypothesize that ketosis, which is known to have a neuroprotective effect in various diseases, may also reduce peritumoral edema and/or inflammation. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is a known mediator of inflammation, and expression profiling analysis showed that animals maintained on a SD have a significant increase in expression of the gene encoding COX-2 in their tumor, while animals maintained on KD showed no such increase. MRI analyses using a Bruker Biospec 70/30 MRI (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Freemont, CA) showed that animals fed KD also have a significant reduction in peritumoral edema. We previously demonstrated that commercially available fluorescent probes such as AngioSense 680 EX (PerkinElmer, Inc.) can be used in concert with in vivo imaging of tumor bioluminescence to demonstrate vascular permeability that can lead to increased peritumoral edema. We are now using the XenoLight RediJect COX-2 fluorescent probe (PerkinElmer, Inc) and the AngioSense 680 EX fluorescent probe in combination with the bioluminescent indication of tumor size and MRI analyses of tumor size and peritumoral edema.

4426,"The analgesic effect of low dose focal irradiation in a mouse model of bone cancer is associated with spinal changes in neuro-mediators of nociception Despite the widespread use of radiotherapy to treat painful bone metastases, the mechanism underlying the analgesic effect of low dose ionizing radiation is unknown. Bone cancer pain is mostly associated with an inflammatory response dominated by local activation of osteoclasts and by astrogliosis in the spinal cord. We determined the effects of a 6 Gy irradiation given focally on osteolytic sarcoma cells inoculated in humeri of mice. Pain behavior was assessed using the rota-rod and the grip force test. Seven days post-irradiation (day 17 post-tumor implantation) the performance of mice markedly improved on the rotarod (non-irradiated, 67+/-16s vs irradiated, 223 +/- 22 s; P = 0.0005), and the grip force test (non-irradiated, 34 +/- 4 g vs irradiated, 55 +/- 2 g; P = 0.001). This improvement was similar to the analgesia achieved with 30 mg/kg of the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ketorolac (Rota-rod, 67 +/- 16 s vs 178 +/- 35 s; P = 0.01: grip force test, 34 +/- 4 g, vs 60 +/- 5 g; P = 0.003). Following irradiation, the tumor mass and the number of osteoclasts did not decrease while the expression of two pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) increased. Tumor irradiation led to clear differences in the spinal cord. These include a decrease in glial activity (astrocytes and microglial cells) as well as pain mediators such as dynorphin, COX-2 and chemotactic cytokine receptor (CCR2). We conclude that the analgesic effect of low dose irradiation of bone cancer is associated with the alteration of nociceptive transmission in the central nervous system.",Excluded
4459,"An assessment of methods for monitoring entrance surface dose in fluoroscopically guided interventional proceduces In the light of a growing awareness of the risks of inducing skin injuries as a consequence of fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures (FGIPs), this paper reports measurements of ESDs made during the period August 1998 to June 1999 on 137 patients undergoing cardiac, neurological and general FGIPs in the South London area. In addition, different methods suitable for use in a routine monitoring programme of ESD are discussed. Although the need for additional data is acknowledged, the results reported reinforce the need for routine assessments to be made of ESDs in FGIPs. At present, the most reliable and accurate form of ESD measurement would seem to be arrays of TLDs. However, transducer based methods although likely to be less accurate, have considerable advantages in relation to a continuous monitoring programme. It is also suggested that there may be the potential locally for threshold dose area product (DAP) values to be set for specific procedures. These could be used to provide early warning of the potential for skin injuries.",Excluded

4533,"Surgical management of recurrent Rathke's cleft cysts Objective: Rathke's cleft cysts (RCCs) are benign epithelial lesions of the sellar region, frequently treated with cyst fenestration and drainage, via a transsphenoidal craniotomy (TSC) approach. While these lesions are benign, they have an appreciable recurrence rate. At present, the literature contains limited data regarding factors contributing to recurrence in patients treated for recurrent cysts. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective analysis of pathology-confirmed RCCs from 1995 to 2016 in our institutional database. TSC for cyst fenestration and drainage was our first-line therapy for symptomatic patients with open craniotomy or radiation as a salvage therapy. Result(s): We identified 112 surgeries for RCC in 101 patients. The mean age of patients presenting for reoperation was significantly higher than for patients presenting for their first operation (42.4 +/- 17 years vs. 58.6 +/- 17 years, p < 0.001). Ninety-one surgeries (80.5%) were primary operations and 21 surgeries in 18 patients (19.5%) were reoperations. Of the 91 patients who underwent their first operation at our institution, eight (8.7%) required reoperation for recurrence. Intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak repair was performed in 53% of cases and was more common in reoperation cases (71 vs. 48%, p < 0.04). There were no new neurological deficits or perioperative deaths; however, one patient developed an internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm requiring endovascular treatment. Two patients (9.5%) in the reoperation group developed a postoperative CSF leak, one of which resolved with lumbar drain and one of which required a reoperation. Of the 16 reoperation patients for whom data were available, 11/16 (68.6%) were on pituitary hormone supplementation prior to their reoperations, and 6/16 (37.5%) had diabetes insipidus (DI) requiring desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) at home. Of the 10 reoperation patients without DI prior to revision, the rates of transient hyponatremia (3/10 vs. 4/91, p < 0.04) and transient DI (5/10 vs. 17/91, p=0.04) were significantly higher in the reoperation group. The rate of new permanent DI was not higher for reoperation patients (2/10 vs. 4/91, p < 0.001). At the last clinical follow-up, 15% of patients reported worsened headaches, 52% reported unchanged headaches, and 33% reported improvement. Of the patients with visual deficits prior to surgery, 61.5% of patients reported improved vision, 30.8% of patients reported stable vision, and 7.7% of patients reported worsening of vision. RCC recurrence developed in 7/45 patients (15.6%) <40 years of age, compared with 22/64 patients (34.4%) =40 years of age (p < 0.04). Recurrence was observed in 4/10 RCCs (40%) with squamous metaplasia compared with 25/99 (25.2%) patients without squamous metaplasia (p=0.45). Recurrence was observed in 4/12 RCCs (33.3%) with inflammation which was not statistically different from the rates of recurrence in patients without inflammation 25/97 (25.7%, p=0.73). Conclusion(s): Reoperation for recurrent RCC is a safe and effective intervention for patients with recurrent visual symptoms or headaches. Many patients present with hypopituitarism, thus care should be taken to ensure adequate hormonal supplementation in the perioperative period. Additionally, patients should be counseled that hormonal recovery is unlikely and additional hormonal supplementation may be required following reoperation. RCCs show an appreciable recurrence rate and require fastidious long-term follow-up.",Excluded
4276,"A novel TNFRSF member, TROY (TNFRSF19), is upregulated in glioblastoma and mediates glioblastoma cell invasion and survival Glioblastoma (GB) is the most malignant form of all primary adult brain tumors. Of the features that characterize GB, arguably none is more clinically significant than the propensity of glioma cells to aggressively invade the surrounding normal brain tissue. These invasive cells render complete resection impossible and confer resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. To improve treatment of malignant glioma, we must find a way to stop the dispersing tumor cells. Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily and their cognate receptors regulate various cellular responses including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. The TROY gene (TNFRSF19) encodes an orphan member of the TNFR superfamily: a type I cell-surface receptor that lacks a cytoplasmic death domain but contains a single TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-binding site. We demonstrate that TROY expression correlates inversely with patient survival and drives GB cell migration and invasion. Our results showed that TROY overexpression in glioma cells activated Rac1 signaling in a Pyk2-dependent manner to drive invasion and migration. Knockdown of TROY in a primary GB xenograft significantly prolonged survival in vivo. In addition, when we activated expression of TROY in mouse astrocytes in vivo using an RCAS vector system for glial-specific gene transfer in G-tva transgenic mice, astrocyte migration was induced within the brain, corroborating the in vitro importance of the TROY signaling cascade in GB invasion. TROY expression significantly increased resistance of GB cells to both IRand TMZ-induced apoptosis in vitro via the Akt and NF-kappaB activation. Inhibition of either Akt or NF-kappaB activity suppressed the survival benefits of TROY signaling in response to TMZ treatment. These findings suggest that the aberrant expression and/or signaling by TROY contributes to, and possibly drives, the malignant dispersion of glioma cells.",Excluded

4266,"Modulation of cone horizontal cell activity in the teleost fish retina. III. Effects of prolonged darkness and dopamine on electrical coupling between horizontal cells The effects of prolonged darkness and dopamine on the coupling between horizontal cells in the isolated, superfused white perch retina were studied. Two assays of coupling were employed; area versus amplitude relationships (area-response curves) and the diffusion of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow from intracellularly injected cells to neighboring cells. In prolonged dark-adapted retinas, area-response curves were difficult to determine because of the small light responses; however, light-evoked responses did not increase in size when light spots were larger than 0.8 mm in diameter. Following the presentation of dim background illumination that partially sensitized the retina, responses to light spots of various sizes were enhanced and an area-response curve could be constructed. Subsequent presentation of moderate background illumination that more fully sensitized the retina resulted in reduced responses to small spots (less than 1.6 mm in diameter) and enhanced responses to large spot or full-field stimuli. In retinas exposed to moderate background illumination, Lucifer yellow injected intracellularly into cone horizontal cells diffused into many neighboring horizontal cells. The coupled cells were very similar in morphology, suggesting they were of the same type. In prolonged dark-adapted retinas, on the other hand, the dye was usually restricted to the injected cell and a few adjacent cells. These results indicate that coupling between cone horizontal cells is modulated by prolonged darkness and background illumination. Following dopamine (50 microM) application, in both 6-OHDA-treated and untreated retinas, changes in area-response curves of cone horizontal cells were observed just opposite to those that occurred when prolonged dark-adapted retinas were exposed to background illumination. That is, following 5 min application of dopamine to the retina, responses to small spots (less than 2 mm in diameter) increased in size while responses to larger spots decreased in amplitude compared with control responses. Following 20 min of superfusion with dopamine, the recorded responses were very small, and an accurate area-response curve could not be determined. Following dopamine application to light-sensitized retinas, Lucifer yellow was restricted to the injected cells or to the injected cell and a few neighboring cells. The results suggest that the modulation of coupling between cone horizontal cells by prolonged darkness and background illumination may be mediated by dopamine. Spatial properties of rod horizontal cells were also examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Excluded
4130,"Three-dimensional image fusion is associated with lower radiation exposure and shorter time to carotid cannulation during carotid artery stenting OBJECTIVE: Three-dimensional (3D) image fusion is associated with lower radiation exposure, contrast agent dose, and operative time during endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of this technology on carotid artery stenting (CAS).METHODS: We identified consecutive CAS procedures from 2009 to 2017 and compared those performed with and without 3D image fusion. For image fusion, we created a 3D reconstruction of the aortic arch anatomy based on preoperative computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography that we merged with two-dimensional fluoroscopy, allowing 3D image overlay. We compared radiation exposure, fluoroscopy time, contrast agent dose, time to common carotid artery (CCA) cannulation, time from CCA cannulation to completion angiography, and total procedure time in procedures with and without image fusion. We also assessed rates of 30-day stroke/death, in-hospital and 30-day stroke, and acute kidney injury. We used multivariable linear regression to adjust for patient and procedural characteristics and used these models to compute the marginal effects of image fusion compared with no image fusion.RESULTS: There were 46 patients who underwent CAS with a 3D image fusion system and 70 patients without. Patients undergoing CAS with image fusion experienced 31% lower radiation exposure compared with the control group (207 +/- 23 mGy vs 300 +/- 26 mGy, respectively; P < .01), shorter fluoroscopy time (21 +/- 6 minutes vs 24 +/- 8 minutes; P = .02), shorter time to carotid cannulation (21 +/- 9 minutes vs 31 +/- 8 minutes; P < .001), and shorter total procedure time (47 +/- 13 minutes vs 54 +/- 18 minutes; P = .03). There was no difference in contrast material volume, time from CCA cannulation to completion angiography, or total in-room time. After multivariable adjustment, 3D image fusion remained associated with lower radiation dose, shorter fluoroscopy time, and shorter time to carotid cannulation (all P < .05). The rate of 30-day stroke/death was 2.7% (three strokes and no deaths at 30 days), and the rate of acute kidney injury was 1.8%.CONCLUSIONS: CAS with 3D image fusion was associated with lower radiation exposure and shorter time to CCA cannulation. These results represent the potential technical advantage gained with image fusion and add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating its impact on radiation exposure and operative times during complex endovascular procedures.",Excluded
3862,"Dental therapy before and after radiotherapy--an evaluation on patients with head and neck malignancies The present investigation evaluates the dental care situation of patients with head and neck cancer before and after radiotherapy. The situations of these patients in 1993 and 2005 were compared to detect similarities, differences and developments. In the years 1993 and 2005, 37 and 36 patients, respectively, with head and neck cancer treated by the local departments of otorhinolaryngology and of radiotherapy were examined consecutively according to their aftercare appointments. Time points of radiotherapy treatment of the patients evaluated in 1993 varied from 1984 to 1993. The patients evaluated in 2005 had received radiotherapy between 1998 and 2005. Therefore the applied radiotherapeutic regimen differed not only between the two groups of patients, but also within each group. The information for these investigations was provided anonymously. It was evaluated with descriptive statistics. The evaluation of the data shows distinct differences with respect to preventive and therapeutic dental care measures. In 2005, 35 out of 36 patients (97.2%) had a dental consultation before radiotherapy (1993, 65%). All 27 dentate patients (100%) obtained a splint for fluoride application (1993, none). 29% fewer edentulous patients were seen than in 1993. The number of teeth destroyed decreased from 19.2% (1993) to 7.8% in 2005. Mycoses due to Candida spp. and chronic failures in wound healing were rare (5.5%). In the course of the 12 years, prophylactic measures, such as the application of splints for fluoride treatment, were intensified. However, concepts for the dental care of patients undergoing radiotherapy, especially following the radiation, should be widened to avoid ruined teeth and long delayed wound healings.",Excluded

In this experiment, the effect of repeated, acute exposure to a low intensity 900 MHz radiofrequency (RF) field pulsed at 217 Hz was explored using an appetitively-motivated spatial learning and working memory task. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed under far field conditions in a GTEM cell for 45 min each day for 10 days at an average whole-body specific energy absorption rate (SAR) of 0.05 W/kg. Their performance in an 8-arm radial maze was compared to that of sham-exposed control animals. All behavioral assessments were performed without handlers having knowledge of the exposure status of the animals. Animals were tested in the maze immediately following exposure or after a delay of 15 or 30 min. No significant field-dependent effects on performance were observed in choice accuracy or in total times to complete the task across the experiment. These results suggest that exposure to RF radiation simulating a digital wireless telephone (GSM) signal under the conditions of this experiment does not affect the acquisition of the learned response.

This is a retrospective, observational, single-center trial analyzing 77 consecutive patients with recurrent BM who were treated primarily with WBRT. All patients underwent SRS as salvage treatment. Median age was 62 years, and median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) was 80. The median interval between the starting date of WBRT and radiosurgery was 10.6 months. One, two and more than two SRS sessions were required in 42, 13 and 22 patients, respectively. The median total planning target volume (PTV) was 8.1 mL and the median dose prescribed was 20 Gy. The median follow-up was 7.7 months. 1- and 2-year neurological death-free survival (NS) rates were 87 and 78 %, respectively. Competing risk analysis demonstrated active extra-central nervous system (CNS) disease [Hazard ratio (HR) 0.236, P = 0.041] and total PTV on initial SRS (>= 5 mL) (HR 4.22, P = 0.033) to be associated with the NS rate. 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates were 41 and 11 %, respectively. The median OS time was 8.2 months. Active extra-CNS disease (HR 1.94, P = 0.034) and high KPS (>= 90) (HR 0.409, P = 0.006) were associated with the OS rate.

3698,"Dual role of MRK in glioblastoma invasion and radio-resistance Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive tumor of the central nervous system, has poor prognosis both because of diffuse infiltration of tumor cells in the normal parenchyma and resistance to radiation treatment and chemotherapy. We found that MRK, a stress-activated MAP3K protein kinase, is overexpressed in GBM compared with normal brain tissue, evident in microarray expression data and confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. We have shown that MRK can be activated by at least two distinct signaling inputs: MRK kinase activity is stimulated by ionizing radiation (IR) downstream of NBS1 and ATM in a pathway that leads to activation of Chk2 and cell-cycle arrest. We also showed that downregulation of MRK by RNA interference sensitizes SNB19 and U87 GBM cells to IR. In addition, MRK functions as an effector of RhoC in a pathway that is initiated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a motogenic factor that is overproduced in GBM tumors. We also showed that MRK depletion impairs LPA-stimulated invasion in GBM cells. To examine the role of MRK in GBM in vivo, we used an orthotopic xenograft model. Human GBM explant cells (GBM6) were maintained in nude mice as flank tumors, transduced in vitro with lentiviruses expressing control or MRK shRNA, and subsequently implanted into the brains of nude mice. Control mice had a median survival of 47 days, whereas downregulation of MRK increased survival by 14 days. In a parallel experiment, mice were treated with 20-Gy radiation in 10 fractions over 5 days. This radiation treatment on its own increased survival by only 7 days; in contrast, downregulation of MRK had a strongly synergistic effect, extending survival by more than 35 days.

This study estimated the effective dose (ED) from DLP measurements using the appropriate k-factors. SSDE was calculated from the product of CTDIvol with the appropriate conversion factor, based on the sum of the lateral and anteroposterior diameters. Results are compared with international DRL data. Result(s): Compared to national DRLs, the local DRLs regarding the CTDIvol values were lower by 14% for Abdomen-Pelvis, 43% for Brain and 25% for Chest-Abdomen-Pelvis exams. For CTPA and heart exams national DRLs were not suggested. In comparison to international DRLs, the picture of our results is mixed, having both higher and lower DRLs than other countries. However, for the CTPA exams, the local DRLs were higher by a range of 13%-30%. SSDE mean values were higher than CTDIvol mean values by a range of 19%- 24%, nonetheless for the brain exams their mean values were the same. Conclusion(s): The metrics of CTDIvol, DLP and ED were useful to evaluate our institution's radiology practice regarding the radiation exposure. Since SSDE is a more accurate patient dose indicator, it would be advantageous to be established as a DRL.",Excluded
4785,"Photoresponse diversity among the five types of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) mediate non-image-forming visual responses, including pupillary constriction, circadian photoentrainment and suppression of pineal melatonin secretion. Five morphological types of ipRGCs, M1-M5, have been identified in mice. In order to understand their functions better, we studied the photoresponses of all five cell types, by whole-cell recording from fluorescently labelled ipRGCs visualized using multiphoton microscopy. All ipRGC types generated melanopsin-based ('intrinsic') as well as synaptically driven ('extrinsic') light responses. The intrinsic photoresponses of M1 cells were lower threshold, higher amplitude and faster than those of M2-M5. The peak amplitudes of extrinsic light responses differed among the ipRGC types; however, the responses of all cell types had comparable thresholds, kinetics and waveforms, and all cells received rod input. While all five types exhibited inhibitory amacrine-cell and excitatory bipolar-cell inputs from the 'on' channel, M1 and M3 received additional 'off'-channel inhibition, possibly through their 'off'-sublamina dendrites. The M2-M5 ipRGCs had centre-surround-organized receptive fields, implicating a capacity to detect spatial contrast. In contrast, the receptive fields of M1 cells lacked surround antagonism, which might be caused by the surround of the inhibitory input nullifying the surround of the excitatory input. All ipRGCs responded robustly to a wide range of motion speeds, and M1-M4 cells appeared tuned to different speeds, suggesting that they might analyse the speed of motion. Retrograde labelling revealed that M1-M4 cells project to the superior colliculus, suggesting that the contrast and motion information signalled by these cells could be used by this sensorimotor area to detect novel objects and motion in the visual field.",Excluded
4602,"Gamma knife radiosurgery after stereotactic aspiration for large cystic brain metastases Objective : Several treatment options have proven effective for metastatic brain tumors, including surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery. Tumors with cystic components, however, are difficult to treat using a single method. We retrospectively assessed the outcome and efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for cystic brain metastases after stereotactic aspiration of cystic components to decrease the tumor volume. Methods : The study population consisted of 24 patients (13 males, 11 females; mean age, 58.3 years) with cystic metastatic brain tumors treated from January 2002 to August 2008. Non-small cell lung cancer was the most common primary origin. After Leksell stereotactic frame was positioned on each patient, magnetic resonance images (MRI)-guided stereotactic cyst aspiration and GKRS were performed (mean prescription dose : 20.2 Gy). After treatment, patients were evaluated by MRI every 3 or 4 months. Results : After treatment, 13 patients (54.2%) demonstrated tumor control, 5 patients (20.8%) showed local tumor progression, and 6 patients (25.0%) showed remote progression. Mean follow-up duration was 13.1 months. During this period, 10 patients (41.7%) died, but only 1 patient (4.2%) died from brain metastases. The overall median survival after these procedures was 17.8 months. Conclusion : These results support the usefulness of GKRS after stereotactic cyst aspiration in patients with large cystic brain metastases. This method is especially effective for the patients whose general condition is very poor for general anesthesia and those with metastatic brain tumors located in eloquent areas.

3719,"Cytogenetic comparison of the sensitivity to mutagens in mice selected for high (HA) and low (LA) swim stress-induced analgesia Sensitivity to mutagens was studied in mouse lines selectively bred for high analgesia (HA) and for low analgesia (LA) induced by 3-min swimming in 20 degrees C water. Apart from pain-related traits HA mice also manifest, as compared to the LA line, higher emotionality in various behavioural tests, and cope worse with the hypothermic challenge of swimming in cold water. In the present study HA mice appeared more susceptible to the mutagenic effect of whole-body gamma-radiation and mitomycin-C injection. Both treatments caused higher frequencies of chromosomal aberrations and micronucleus in bone marrow cells in the HA than in the LA line. The results are discussed in terms of a genetic correlation between animals' susceptibility to environmental stressors and the mechanism of mutagenesis. As shown by our recent molecular study, the selection for magnitude of swim analgesia has differentiated the parental outbred population into two distinct genotypes characterised by specific minisatellite and microsatellite sequences for each line, which may be genetic markers of particular traits. We conceive that the breeding strategy, along with the differentiation of stress-related phenomena, has altered the frequencies of genes controlling DNA repair in each line.",Excluded
4617,"A Light-Addressable Potentiometric Sensor for Odorant Detection Using Single Bioengineered Olfactory Sensory Neurons as Sensing Element A light-addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS), a silicon-based surface potential detector, is combined with bioengineered olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) for odorant detection. A LAPS chip is used as a transducer to monitor cell membrane potential changes. In addition, a focused movable laser with a diameter comparable to cell sizes is employed to select the desirable single cell for measurement under a microscope. Bioengineered OSNs are coupled to the LAPS surface and employed as sensing elements, which are prepared by the expression of an olfactory receptor of C. elegans, ODR-10, on the plasma membrane of rat primary OSNs via transient transfection. The responses of bioengineered OSNs to diacetyl, isoamyl acetate, and acetic acid are monitored by extracellular recording using the LAPS chip. Features of the recorded extracellular potential firings are analyzed in frequency and time domains. We have shown that bioengineered OSNs can generate specific response signals upon the stimulation of diacetyl, which is the natural ligand of ODR-10. Moreover, different concentrations of diacetyl can elicit different temporal firing patterns in bioengineered OSNs, which permits the concentration detection of specific odorant molecules in solution.",Excluded
4577,"Sacral nerve stimulator use in a patient with low anterior resection syndrome Introduction: Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer are treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgical resection. Advanced surgical techniques such as mesorectal excision have enabled sphincter sparing surgery to be accomplished for patients with distal cancers. Although these procedures are being done more frequently, they remain fraught with both immediate perioperative and long term complications. Fecal Incontinence (FI) is a significant long term postoperative complication which can result following such surgical intervention. While reports show improvement over a 1-2 year period, a significant number of patients continue to experience FI and the so called Low Anterior Syndrome (LAS). Sacral nerve neuromodulation has been traditionally used for treatment of urinary incontinence with the use of Sacral Nerve Stimulator (SNS) implantation and is now being utilized to treat FI. We report the initial successful use of SNS to treat fecal incontinence secondary to radiation and postoperative changes following treatment for rectal cancer. A 70 year old Asian female was diagnosed with stage III rectal cancer and underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by low anterior resection with diverting ileostomy in 2011. Her ostomy was reversed in August 2012 and she developed fecal incontinence. Non-operative measures were taken in attempt to improve her incontinence without success including fiber supplementation and pelvic floor therapy. Method(s): Prior to SNS implantation the patient was given a Cleveland Clinic Fecal Incontinence Score (CCFIS). Patients rate daily incontinence episodes on a 4 point scale in 5 categories including incontinence to solids, liquids, gas, frequency of protective undergarment pads and need to modify lifestyle. A score of 0 in each category is equivalent to never events and a score of 4 is equal to always with 20 being a maximum score. The patient then underwent placement of the SNS probes into the S3 foramen. This was followed by a 1 week test period in which the patient had the probes connected to an external modulator. Following the test phase she then was reassessed with the CCFIS. Result(s): The patients initial CCFIS was the maximum score of 20. Following insertion of the probe at 1 week the patient reported an improvement in her CCFIS to 11. She maintained incontinence to solids usually (score of 3), liquid never (0), gas always (4), use of pads always (4), lifestyle modification never (0). Conclusion(s): Sacral Nerve Stimulator insertion is potentially an effective treatment for fecal incontinence for patients that have undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiation and resection for rectal cancer. Further study is warranted on larger sample sizes to ensure consistency of results and long term outcomes should be measured.",Excluded
4827,"Patient dosimetric evaluation in angiography practice: Application in interventional neuroradiology Purpose: To evaluate the risk of a deterministic skin injury from Interventional Radiology (IR) procedures, the Peak Skin Dose (PSD) and the skin dose mapping should be estimate. Dose metrics commonly available such as cumulative air kerma at the interventional reference point (Ka,irp) are usually employed. However, as the PSD may be substantially different from Ka,irp, it is necessary to estimate the PSD and skin dose mapping more accurately. Material(s) and Method(s): A custom made MatLab code has been developed; its output is the PSD and a visual display of the surface dose mapped onto a spherical or cylindrical phantom modeling the head or the trunk of the patient respectively. The code works by translating the Ka,irp (corrected by back-scatter factor) to the location of the patient's skin, represented by a surface of the geometrical model and using dosimetric and geometric parameters (primary and secondary angles of the two tubes, longitudinal displacement of the bed) for each radiation event stored in the radiation dose structured report (RDSR). The setting of the dimension of the geometrical phantom depends on the anatomical size of the patient measured from images stored during IR procedures. To validate the code, arrays of thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were placed on the phantom surface and on the skin of 9 patients undergoing neuroendovascular treatments, both cerebral and spinal (Artis zee biplane, Siemens). Result(s): The Ka,irp provided by the Angiography System overestimates the measured PSD by more than 50% for head treatments. The percent difference between the PSD calculated and measured by TLD is within 35%. The skin dose mapped on the surface of the geometrical model is in agreement with the dose distribution measured by TLD. Conclusion(s): In Neuro-IR, the use of more detailed information from RDSR can improve the accuracy of the calculated PSD. The implemented algorithm can be applied to evaluate the PSD and skin dose mapping without direct dosimetry. Copyright Â© 2016",Excluded

4774,"Microwaves and Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's diseases (AD) is the most common type of dementia and a neurodegenerative disease that occurs when the nerve cells in the brain die. The cause and treatment of AD remain unknown. However, AD is a disease that affects the brain, an organ that controls behavior. Accordingly, anything that can interact with the brain may affect this organ positively or negatively, thereby protecting or encouraging AD. In this regard, modern life encompasses microwaves for all issues including industrial, communications, medical and domestic tenders, and among all applications, the cell phone wave, which directly exposes the brain, continues to be the most used. Evidence suggests that microwaves may produce various biological effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and many arguments relay the possibility that microwaves may be involved in the pathophysiology of CNS disease, including AD. By contrast, previous studies have reported some beneficial cognitive effects and that microwaves may protect against cognitive impairment in AD. However, although many of the beneficial effects of microwaves are derived from animal models, but can easily be extrapolated to humans, whether microwaves cause AD is an important issue that is to be addressed in the current review.

4275,"Oxaliplatin and doxorubicin treatment for relapsed and refractory high-risk neuroblastoma Background: Doxorubicin and cisplatin are active agents used in induction therapy for high risk neuroblastoma. Doxorubicin utilization is limited by concerns for cardiotoxicity. Oxaliplatin, a third generation platinum compound has shown activity in cisplatin resistant tumors and does not have significant nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity. Objective(s): A retrospective review to describe the toxicity of and response to oxaliplatin and doxorubicin in relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma. Design/Method: Oxaliplatin (105-130 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) was administered on day 1 together with doxorubicin (20 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and dexrazoxane (200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on days 1, 2, and 3 of a three-week course with myeloid growth factor support. Toxicity was assessed using NCI-CTCAE v.3. Responses were assessed using International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC). Result(s): Seven patients with neuroblastoma (1 refractory, 6 recurrent) received a median of three courses (range 1-6). Grade 4 hematological toxicity occurred in all patients as expected. Three patients had prolonged thrombocytopenia, delaying therapy by >14 days between courses. One patient had grade 3 neutropenic enterocolitis. Another patient had grade 3 hemorrhagic cystitis attributed to doxorubicin induced radiation recall. Cardiac toxicity was not observed with serial echocardiogram monitoring. Two of 7 patients had objective responses (1 CR and 1 PR). One additional patient had a mixed response. Three patients had stable disease for a median of three courses and one patient had progressive disease.

Initial cranial computed tomography (CT) revealed a hypodense area in the right parietal lobe showing no contrast enhancement. The follow-up CT done after 2 months showed an irregular, slightly hyperdense tumor surrounded by oedema with mass effect and midline shift. However, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations revealed no pathological changes. Neurosurgical operation was performed and the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been established on the basis of histological and immunological investigation of the tumor. The pattern of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement in the patients' bone marrow aspirate and brain tumor was identical and suggested that both tumors originated from the same B-cell progenitors.

4807,"Establishment and Characteristic Analysis of a Dog Model for Autologous Homologous Cranioplasty Objective. The aim of this study is to establish a large animal (dog) model that can be referred clinically for autologous homologous cranioplasty. Methods. Our large skull defect dog model was established by emulating the decompressive craniectomy with 22 adult beagle dogs. The autologous bones were taken out from the dogs and divided into two groups, the freeze-drying (FD) group and the single freezing (SF) group. They were then stored in the bone bank at-20degreeC after being irradiated with 25 KGy. Three months later, the bones were reimplanted. After operation, we closely watch the experimental objects for four more months examining the infection and survival of the bone graft. Results. Through macroscopic observation, it was found that, among 44 cranial flaps (bilateral) from the rest of the 22 dogs, grade A cranial flaps accounted for 86.4% (19/22) in the SF group and only 31.8% (7/22) in the FD group. Although osteogenic osteoclast, Harvard tube, neovascularization, and angiogenic factors were found through the pathological results, including an electron microscope and calmodulin tracer, it could be verified by using X-CT and micro-CT that early bone resorption could be still found even in grade A bone flap. Conclusion. By using the common clinical method to preserve the cranial flaps, we established an experimental dog model of autologous cranioplasty for a large area of cranial defect. It was proved that this model could reproduce the infections and bone resorption which typically happened in clinical autologous homologous cranioplasty. As a conclusion, the established model can be used as an effective experimental tool for further research to improve the success rate of autologous homologous cranioplasty.

4057,"Noninvasive fluorescence imaging in animal models of stroke Noninvasive fluorescence imaging (NFI) is a powerful tool to study physiology and pathophysiology in animal disease models. NFI has been successfully applied in a number of animal disease models including cancer, arthritis, and stroke. Furthermore, several applications in humans have been described. NFI is widely available in research laboratories because it has a number of advantages: It uses non-ionizing radiation and requires comparably simple, inexpensive instrumentation, and easy to handle. Fluorochromes can be detected with high sensitivity, and image acquisition time is relatively short. Furthermore, a plethora of fluorescent imaging agents is available including unspecific, target-specific, and activatable imaging probes.

Groups of intact albino and black-eyed rats and albino animals with light-induced photoreceptor damage were studied in the dark period before, and after 15 and 30 min of exposure to either 0.0005, 0.175 or 3.33 microW/cm2 irradiance of light. In animals with photoreceptor damage, the sensitivity of the pineal gland to light decreased so that only the highest irradiance tested (3.33 microW/cm2) was capable of totally inhibiting pineal NAT activity and melatonin levels. In one study, pineal NAT and melatonin levels in intact albino rats were inhibited by all three irradiances studied. In a second experiment, albino and black-eyed animals behaved identically, only responding with a depression in pineal NAT and melatonin after exposure to light irradiances of either 0.175 or 3.33 microW/cm2. In conclusion, the lowest irradiance of cool white light capable of inhibiting pineal NAT and melatonin in albino rats is around 0.0005 microW/cm2. At the irradiances studied, photoreceptor damage influences the response of pineal NAT and melatonin to acute light exposure at night. On the other hand, eye pigmentation does not seem to have a major effect on the nighttime inhibition of the pineal by light.",Excluded

4647,"Robust/optimal temperature profile control of a high-speed aerospace vehicle using neural networks An approximate dynamic programming (ADP)-based suboptimal neurocontroller to obtain desired temperature for a high-speed aerospace vehicle is synthesized in this paper. A 1-D distributed parameter model of a fin is developed from basic thermal physics principles. ""Snapshot"" solutions of the dynamics are generated with a simple dynamic inversion-based feedback controller. Empirical basis functions are designed using the ""proper orthogonal decomposition"" (POD) technique and the snapshot solutions. A low-order nonlinear lumped parameter system to characterize the infinite dimensional system is obtained by carrying out a Galerkin projection. An ADP-based neurocontroller with a dual heuristic programming (DHP) formulation is obtained with a single-network-adaptive-critic (SNAC) controller for this approximate nonlinear model. Actual control in the original domain is calculated with the same POD basis functions through a reverse mapping. Further contribution of this paper includes development of an online robust neurocontroller to account for unmodeled dynamics and parametric uncertainties inherent in such a complex dynamic system. A neural network (NN) weight update rule that guarantees boundedness of the weights and relaxes the need for persistence of excitation (PE) condition is presented. Simulation studies show that in a fairly extensive but compact domain, any desired temperature profile can be achieved starting from any initial temperature profile. Therefore, the ADP and NN-based controllers appear to have the potential to become controller synthesis tools for nonlinear distributed parameter systems.",Excluded
3738,"The distinctive cellular responses to DNA strand breaks caused by a DNA topoisomerase I poison in conjunction with DNA replication and RNA transcription Camptothecin (CPT) inhibits DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) through a non-catalytic mechanism that stabilizes the Top1-DNA cleavage complex (Top1cc) and blocks the DNA re-ligation step, resulting in the accumulation in the genome of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs), which are converted to secondary strand breaks when they collide with the DNA replication and RNA transcription machinery. DNA strand breaks mediated by replication, which have one DNA end, are distinct in repair from the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that have two ends and are caused by ionizing radiation and other agents. In contrast to two-ended DSBs, such one-ended DSBs are preferentially repaired through the homologous recombination pathway. Conversely, the repair of one-ended DSBs by the non-homologous end-joining pathway is harmful for cells and leads to cell death. The choice of repair pathway has a crucial impact on cell fate and influences the efficacy of anticancer drugs such as CPT derivatives. In addition to replication-mediated one-ended DSBs, transcription also generates DNA strand breaks upon collision with the Top1cc. Some reports suggest that transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks correlate with neurodegenerative diseases. However, the details of the repair mechanisms of, and cellular responses to, transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks still remain unclear.

Primary blast exposure without secondary injuries or clinical symptoms at the time has not been studied. Objective(s): Residual effects on neuroimaging metrics of exposure to primary blast insufficient to meet criteria formild TBI were assessed. Method(s): Post-deployment veterans without mTBI, with (n=20) and without (n=18) primary blast exposure were assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). WM-specific registration followed by whole-brain voxel-wise analysis of fractional anisotropic (FA) diffusion was conducted in all subjects.

3677,"The ATM gene and protein: possible roles in genome surveillance, checkpoint controls and cellular defence against oxidative stress The autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is highly pleiotropic. It is characterized by gradual loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, leading to progressive neuromotor deterioration, immunodeficiency, developmental defects in specific tissues, profound predisposition to malignancy and acute sensitivity to ionizing radiation. AT cells show chromosomal instability, premature senesence, radiosensitivity and defects in cell cycle checkpoints activated by ionizing radiation. Several radiation induced pathways that regulate the cell cycle seem to be defective in AT cells, at least one of which is mediated by TP53. Extensive characterization of the cellular defects of AT cells, together with the recent isolation of the ATM gene, has provided some insight into the possible physiological roles of the ATM protein. Several lines of evidence, including the nature of the agents that elicit the hypersensitivity of AT cells, point to the possibility of a defect in the response to damage induced by oxidative stress, which affects various cellular macromolecules. The ATM protein might have a role in activating defence mechanisms against oxidative stress. This hypothesis broadens the previous concept of the AT defect and explains several aspects of the AT phenotype that cannot be accounted for by defective processing of DNA damage.

Among them, 42 patients received chemotherapy while 18 patients did not receive after WBRT. With regard to anti-HER2 therapy, after WBRT, 17 patients received anti-HER2 treatment without prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy, 7 patients received anti-HER2 treatment with prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy, and 36 patients did not receive further anti-HER2 treatment. All patients were followed up regularly until January 23, 2013.RESULTS: The median OS of patients with BM was 12 months. Patients who received anti-HER2 therapy and chemotherapy after WBRT had significantly better survival compared with patients who did not receive further treatment. Patients who received anti-HER2 treatment after WBRT but did not receive adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy for early breast cancer had better OS, followed by patients who received anti-HER2 agent both in adjuvant treatment and after WBRT and patients who did not receive anti-HER2 treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that Karnofsky Performance Status, control of extracranial metastases, chemotherapy after WBRT, and anti-HER2 therapy combined with WBRT were all independent predictors for OS.CONCLUSION: Both chemotherapy and anti-HER2 therapy after WBRT could improve OS.

Additionally, a protocol for the interstitial stereotactic placement of cylindrical diffusers was established and applied on patients with recurrent, inoperable glioblastoma. Result(s): Compared to normal cortex, mean PPIX fluorescence in vital tumor was found more than 100-fold increased. During PDT, the PPIX fluorescence bleached to 8%, 16%, and 1% of the initial intensity for the 100, 150, and 200 J/cm2 groups (median values). FGR: Contrast-enhancing tumor was completely resected in 65% of patients in the ALA group compared to 36% in the white-light group (p < 0.0001). Progression-free survival was superior in the ALA group compared to white-light patients with cumulative 6 months progression-free survival rates of 41% and 21% (p = 0.0003), respectively. Interstitial PDT can be performed with multiple radial diffusers approximately 10 mm apart, 200 mW/cm, and an irradiation time of one hour. Â© 2007 by Begell House, Inc.",Excluded

4349,"A role for hydrolysis of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in terminating the response to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and to a flash of light in Limulus ventral photoreceptors Injection of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins 1,4,5-P3) into Limulus ventral photoreceptors produces excitation similar to that produced by light. One process which might contribute to rapid termination of the responses to Ins 1,4,5-P3 and to light is the hydrolysis of Ins 1,4,5-P3 by an InsP3-5-phosphatase to form inositol 1,4-bisphosphate. Inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins 2,4,5-P3) is known to be less hydrolysable by the InsP3-5-phosphatase than is Ins 1,4,5-P3. Whereas ventral photoreceptors respond to an injection of Ins 1,4,5-P3 with a single wave of depolarization, the response to Ins 2,4,5-P3 is a burst of waves of depolarization. Our hypothesis is that it is the resistance to hydrolysis by the InsP3-5-phosphatase which accounts for the burst of waves produced by Ins 2,4,5-P3. To test this idea we injected ventral photoreceptors with Ins 1,4,5-P3 in the presence of the non-specific phosphatase inhibitors, vanadate and fluoride, which prolong the response to a flash of light in ventral photoreceptors (D.W. Corson, A. Fein, W.W. Walthall, J. Gen. Physiol. 82 (1983) 659-677). In the presence of fluoride or vanadate the response to Ins 1,4,5-P3 was composed of a burst of waves rather than a single wave of depolarization. We conclude that hydrolysis of Ins 1,4,5-P3 by the InsP3-5-phosphatase plays a role in terminating the ventral photoreceptors response to Ins 1,4,5-P3 and also to light.",Excluded
4654,"A link between vascular damage and cognitive deficits after whole-brain radiation therapy for cancer: A clue to other types of dementia? Whole brain radiation therapy for the treatment of tumors can sometimes cause cognitive impairment. Memory deficits were noted in up to 50% of treated patients over a short period of several months. In addition, an increased rate of dementia in young patients has been noted over the longer term, i.e. years. A deficit in neurogenesis after irradiation has been postulated to be the main cause of cognitive decline in patients, but recent data on irradiation therapy for limited parts of the brain appear to indicate other possibilities. Irradiation can directly damage various types of cells other than neuronal stem cells. However, this paper will focus on injury to brain vasculature leading to cognitive decline since vessels represent a better therapeutic target for drug development than other cells in the brain because of the blood-brain barrier.",Excluded
4744,"Flat panel CT following stapes prosthesis insertion: an experimental and clinical study OBJECTIVES: Anatomical information of the middle and inner ear is becoming increasingly important in post-operative evaluation especially after stapesplasty with unsuccessful improvement of the air-bone gap (ABG). So far computed tomography (CT) has been the first choice for detection of reasons for recurrent hearing loss. CT has the disadvantage of metal-induced artefacts after insertion of middle ear implants and of a relatively high irradiation dose.METHODS: Flat panel CT (fpCT) was performed in three temporal bone specimen after experimental insertion of different stapes prostheses, aiming to validate the accuracy of fpCT of the middle and inner ear. Additionally, 28 consecutive patients, supplied with different stapes prostheses underwent post-operative fpCT to compare the pre- and post-operative hearing results with the determined prosthesis position in the middle and inner ear.RESULTS: In all cases, fpCT showed a statistically significant correlation between hearing improvement and prosthesis position. This technique provided detailed post-operative information of the implant position in patients and temporal bone specimen.CONCLUSIONS: The new imaging technique of fpCT allows the immediate and almost artefact-free evaluation of surgical results following stapesplasty. Further benefits are a lower irradiation dose and higher isovolumetric resolution compared with standard CT.KEY POINTS: Flat panel computed tomography (fpCT) helps otosurgeons design precise stapes protheses. fpCT allows a prediction of the postoperative hearing outcome in patients. fpCT is an adequate imaging technique for immediate postoperative quality control. Postoperative management of patients with prosthesis-related complications is more appropriate.",Excluded

4635,"Sodium sulfide selectively induces oxidative stress, DNA damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction and radiosensitizes glioblastoma (GBM) cells Glioblastoma (GBM) has a poor prognosis despite intensive treatment with surgery and chemoradiotherapy. Previous studies using dose-escalated radiotherapy have demonstrated improved survival; however, increased rates of radionecrosis have limited its use. Development of radiosensitizers could improve patient outcome. In the present study, we report the use of sodium sulfide (Na<sub>2</sub>S), a hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) donor, to selectively kill GBM cells (T98G and U87) while sparing normal human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3). Na<sub>2</sub>S also decreased mitochondrial respiration, increased oxidative stress and induced gammaH2AX foci and oxidative base damage in GBM cells. Since Na<sub>2</sub>S did not significantly alter T98G capacity to perform non-homologous end-joining or base excision repair, it is possible that GBM cell killing could be attributed to increased damage induction due to enhanced reactive oxygen species production. Interestingly, Na<sub>2</sub>S enhanced mitochondrial respiration, produced a more reducing environment and did not induce high levels of DNA damage in hCMEC/D3. Taken together, this data suggests involvement of mitochondrial respiration in Na<sub>2</sub>S toxicity in GBM cells. The fact that survival of LN-18 GBM cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (rho<sup>0</sup>) was not altered by Na<sub>2</sub>S whereas the survival of LN-18 rho<sup>+</sup> cells was compromised supports this conclusion. When cells were treated with Na<sub>2</sub>S and photon or proton radiation, GBM cell killing was enhanced, which opens the possibility of H<sub>2</sub>S being a radiosensitizer. Therefore, this study provides the first evidence that H<sub>2</sub>S donors could be used in GBM therapy to potentiate radiation-induced killing.",Excluded
4632,"Distinct inhibition of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels by delta-opioid agonists in dorsal root ganglion neurons devoid of functional T-type Ca2+ currents Both mu- and delta-opioid agonists selectively inhibit nociception but have little effect on other sensory modalities. Voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels in the primary sensory neurons are important for the regulation of nociceptive transmission. In this study, we determined the effect of delta-opioid agonists on voltage-activated Ca(2+) channel currents (I(Ca)) in small-diameter rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons that do and do not bind isolectin B(4) (IB(4)). The delta-opioid agonists [d-Pen(2),d-Pen(5)]-enkephalin (DPDPE) and deltorphin II produced a greater inhibition of high voltage-activated I(Ca) in IB(4)-negative than IB(4)-positive neurons. Furthermore, DPDPE produced a greater inhibition of N-, P/Q-, and L-type I(Ca) in IB(4)-negative than IB(4)-positive neurons. However, DPDPE had no significant effect on the R-type I(Ca) in either type of cells. We were surprised to find that DPDPE failed to inhibit either the T-type or high voltage-activated I(Ca) in all the DRG neurons with T-type I(Ca). Double immunofluorescence labeling showed that the majority of the delta-opioid receptor-immunoreactive DRG neurons had IB(4) labeling, while all DRG neurons immunoreactive to delta-opioid receptors exhibited Cav(3.2) immunoreactivity. Additionally, DPDPE significantly inhibited high voltage-activated I(Ca) in Tyrode's or N-methyl-d-glucamine solution but not in tetraethylammonium solution. This study provides new information that delta-opioid agonists have a distinct effect on voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels in different phenotypes of primary sensory neurons. High voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels are more sensitive to inhibition by delta-opioid agonists in IB(4)-negative than IB(4)-positive neurons, and this opioid effect is restricted to DRG neurons devoid of functional T-type Ca(2+) currents.",Excluded
4759,"Hippocampal-sparing and target volume coverage in treating 3 to 10 brain metastases: A comparison of Gamma Knife, single-isocenter VMAT, CyberKnife, and TomoTherapy stereotactic radiosurgery PURPOSE: Our purpose was to evaluate hippocampal doses and target volume coverage with and without hippocampal sparing when treating multiple brain metastases using various stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) platforms.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We selected 10 consecutive patients with 14 separate treatments who had been treated in our department for 3 to 10 brain metastases and added hippocampal avoidance contours. All 14 treatments were planned with GammaPlan for Gamma Knife, Eclipse for single isocenter volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), TomoTherapy Treatment Planning System (TPS) for TomoTherapy, and MultiPlan for CyberKnife. Initial planning was performed with the goal of planning target volume coverage of V100 >=95% without hippocampal avoidance. If the maximum hippocampal point dose (Dmax) was <6.6 Gy in a single fraction and <40% of the hippocampi received <=4.5 Gy, no second plan was performed. If either constraint was not met, replanning was performed with these constraints.RESULTS: There was a median of 6 metastases per plan, with an average total tumor volume of 7.32 mL per plan. The median hippocampal Dmax (in Gy) without sparing averaged 1.65, 9.81, 4.38, and 5.46, respectively (P < .0001). Of 14 plans, 3 Gamma Knife and CyberKnife plans required replanning, whereas 13 VMAT and 8 TomoTherapy plans required replanning. The hippocampal constraints were not achievable in 1 plan on any platform when the tumor was bordering the hippocampus. The mean volume of brain receiving 12 Gy (in mL), which has been associated with symptomatic radionecrosis, was 23.57 with Gamma Knife, 76.77 with VMAT, 40.86 with CyberKnife, and 104.06 with TomoTherapy (P = .01). The overall average conformity indices for all plans ranged from 0.36 to 0.52.CONCLUSIONS: Even with SRS, the hippocampi can receive a considerable dose; however, if the hippocampi are outlined as organs of risk, sparing these structures is feasible in nearly all situations with all 4 platforms, without detriment to target coverage, and should be considered in all patients undergoing SRS for multiple brain metastases.SUMMARY: Hippocampi play an important role in memory, and sparing of these structures in whole brain radiation can improve neurocognitive outcomes. The hippocampi are not routinely spared when using stereotactic radiosurgery. We evaluated the incidental dose to the hippocampi when treating multiple brain metastases and sought to examine if hippocampal sparing is feasible without detriment to target coverage. We found that hippocampal sparing is possible without affecting coverage or conformality in most cases across treatment platforms.",Excluded

The detection of tumor is based on i) review of the machine learning approach for the identification of brain tumor and ii) review of a suitable approach for brain tumor detection. Discussion(s): This review focuses on different imaging techniques such as X-rays, PET, CTScan, and MRI. This survey identifies a different approach with better accuracy for tumor detection. This further includes the image processing method. In most applications, machine learning shows better performance than manual segmentation of the brain tumors from MRI images as it is a difficult and time-consuming task. For fast and better computational results, radiology used a different approach with MRI, CT-scan, X-ray, and PET.

4033,"Shunt age-related complications in adult patients with suspected shunt dysfunction. A recommended diagnostic workup Background: Patients admitted for suspicion of shunt dysfunction (SD) often show unspecific symptoms and require time-consuming, expensive and even invasive diagnostics involving significant radiation exposure. The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the current diagnostic procedures and to propose a process optimisation. Method(s): As all patients admitted for suspicion of SD receive imaging studies, we searched for adult patients receiving neuroimaging in the period from January 2010 to July 2013, analysing referring diagnosis, clinical signs, products, diagnostic process and final diagnosis. Recursive partitioning was used to define time intervals for differentiating types of SD. Result(s): A total of 148 patients, aged 18-89 (mean, 54) years, were studied. Forty-two percent were referred by a hospital or rehabilitation centre, 30% by general practitioners and 24% were self-referrals. The admission diagnosis was in the majority ""shunt dysfunction"" only. Further differentiations were rarely made. An SD was confirmed in 46% of the patients. In 17%, the symptoms were based on another cause and in 37% they could not be clearly attributed to any specific disorder. Abdominal dislocations (2%) and shunt infections (5%) were found within the first 6 months. Over- (3%) and under-drainage (14%) were the most frequent complications during the first 4 years. Disconnections (13%) occurred generally 4 years or more after implantation. Only shunt obstruction (9%) showed no temporal pattern. Conclusion(s): Symptoms of SD remain mostly unspecific. This study showed that the type of SD depends on the time interval from implantation. We propose a workup strategy for patients with SD based on the temporal profile.

3891,"Discrimination and quantification of live/dead rat brain cells using a non-linear segmentation model The automatic cell analysis method is capable of segmenting the cells and can detect the number of live/dead cells present in the body. This study proposed a novel non-linear segmentation model (NSM) for the segmentation and quantification of live/dead cells present in the body. This work also reveals the aspects of electromagnetic radiation on the cell body. The bright images of the hippocampal CA3 region of the rat brain under the resolution of 60 x objective are used to analyze the effects called NISSL-stained dataset. The proposed non-linear segmentation model segments the foreground cells from the cell images based on the linear regression analysis. These foreground cells further get discriminated as live/dead cells and quantified using shape descriptors and geometric method, respectively. The proposed segmentation model is showing promising results (accuracy, 82.82%) in comparison with the existing renowned approaches. The counting analysis of live and dead cells using the proposed method is far better than the manual counts. Therefore, the proposed segmentation model and quantifying procedure is an amalgamated method for cell quantification that yields better segmentation results and provides pithy insights into the analysis of neuronal anomalies at a microscopic level.

3718,"Goniometric measurement for the estimation of anisotropy coefficient of human and animal pancreas Estimation of optical properties of biologic tissues is determinant for laser dosimetry in medical applications. Tissues highly absorb and scatter the light in near infrared spectrum, where the laser provides therapeutic effects. Novel frontiers of clinical practice, e.g., the employment of laser light for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, require information about pancreas-laser interaction, which are crucial for therapy management. The property of biological tissues to scatter the light traveling through is described by the anisotropy coefficient (g). The relationship between g and the angular distribution of the scattered light is described by Henyey-Greenstein phase function. The measurement of angular distribution of scattered light is performed by the goniometric technique. This paper describes the estimation of g of ex vivo pancreas at 1064 nm, performed by a goniometric-based system, where a photodetector measures intensities of scattered light at fixed angles between -120degree and 120degree. A two-term Henyey-Greenstein phase function has been employed to estimate anisotropy coefficient for forward (gfs) and backward scattering (gbs). Experimental trails were performed to assess the repeatability of measurement system: percentage value of standard deviation is generally lower than 8% for angles higher (lower) than 13degree (13degree). Measurements were performed for the first time on healthy swine pancreas, aiming to investigate the influence of coagulation temperature: gfs decreases from 0.94 (at 25 degreeC) to 0.93 (at 80 degreeC). Afterwards, the same set up has been employed for the estimation of g of human pancreas affected by neuroendocrine tumor, which presented an estimated values for gfs of 0.89.",Excluded

4499,"The SOCS box protein STOPS is required for phototransduction through its effects on phospholipase C Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes play roles in a diversity of processes including Drosophila phototransduction. In fly photoreceptor cells, the PLCbeta encoded by norpA is critical for activation of TRP channels. Here, we describe a PLCbeta regulator, STOPS, which encodes a SOCS box protein. Mutation of stops resulted in a reduced concentration of NORPA and a defect in stopping signaling following cessation of the light stimulus. NORPA has been proposed to have dual roles as a PLC- and GTPase-activating protein (GAP). We found that the slow termination resulting from expressing low levels of wild-type NORPA was suppressed by addition of normal amounts of an altered NORPA, which had wild-type GAP activity, but no PLC activity. STOPS is the first protein identified that specifically regulates PLCbeta protein concentration. Moreover, this work demonstrates that a PLCbeta derivative that does not promote TRP channel activation, still contributes to signaling in vivo.",Excluded

Experimental and clinical investigations Epileptiform discharge was recorded from neurons in the thalamic nuclei of chronic pain patients during stereotactic surgery. Hyperactive neurons showed regular firing of 3-5 trains of epileptic-like group discharges with a frequency of 4 to 5 Hz. As described by Lombard et al.

One to three months after the operation, hyperactive neurons were examined in the contra-lateral thalamic nuclei (VP, zona incerta), and lemniscus medialis. The firing patterns and distribution of hyperactive neurons in these animals was very similar to those of humans. The hyperactive neuron was unaffected by electrical stimulation of the nucleus raphe dorsalis (NRD) and locus ceruleus (LC). Administration of phenytoin and diazepam reduced the firing. However, no effect was seen with valproic acid. During spreading depression of the sensorimotor cortex, a remarkable reduction was seen on the firing of thalamic hyperactive neurons.

4122,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation in SCLC Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has well established place in therapy for patients with limited-disease small cell lung cancer who responded to treatment. The data from randomized trials document that PCI reduces brain metastases rate from approximately 60% to 30%, and increases 3-year overall survival by approximately 5%. Currently, the dose of 25 Gy in 10 fractions is considered as standard. In attempt to reduce neuropsychological sequelae attributable to PCI hippocampal sparing techniques are employed. The existing studies suggest the benefit of hippocampal sparing in limiting memory and higher neurocognitive function losses, but with a risk of failures in the spared region. Ongoing studies will further validate the role of hippocampal sparing, both in terms of toxicity reduction and metastases prevention. PCI for patients who have undergone resection for stage I small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is not recommended, PCI may be, however, associated with a favourable outcome in SCLC patients who have undergone complete surgery in stages II-III. The role of PCI in extensive-disease (ED) SCLC has been evolving. Most recent evidence indicate that PCI is controversial in ED patients with response to initial chemotherapy and absence of brain metastases confirmed by contrast-enhanced MRI. The patients who do not receive PCI, must, however, receive periodic MRI examination during follow-up, i.e., remain under active surveillance with access to radiotherapy at brain relapse.

4678,"Non-linear, high-gain and sustained-to-transient signal transmission from rods to amacrine cells in dark-adapted retina of Ambystoma In darkness, On-Off amacrine cells (ACs) of the tiger salamander retina exhibited large spontaneous transient depolarizing potentials (sTDPs) with average peak amplitude of 5.05 +/- 2.5 mV and average frequency of 0.42 +/- 0.25 s(-1). Under voltage-clamp conditions the cell displayed large spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) with average peak amplitude of 98 +/- 39 pA and average frequency of 0.45 +/- 0.22 s(-1). To a light step, ACs gave rise to a transient 'On' response at the light onset and a transient 'Off' response at light offset, followed by a train of TDPs ('After' response). Near the response threshold (0.3 activated rhodopsin molecules per rod per second), light-evoked TDPs (leTDPs) of similar amplitude and kinetics as the large sTDPs observed in darkness were seen, and about half of these leTDPs elicited a regenerative potential (RP). Brighter light steps gave rise to more leTDPs and higher rates of RPs in the On, Off and After responses. Within the linear response range of the rods, the AC response was non-linear, with the highest gain (676 +/- 429) near the dark potential. The amplitude of Off responses increased with the duration of the light step, and ACs may use this to encode speeds of moving stimuli: the faster the light object moves, the smaller the AC Off response. Moreover, the number of leTDPs in the AC After response increased with light intensity, and the onset of the After response coincides with bipolar cell tail response recovery. One possible origin of the large sTDPs and leTDPs is the spontaneous and depolarization-induced regenerative calcium potentials (RCaPs) in bipolar cell synaptic terminals. RCaPs in bipolar cell synaptic terminals cause transient glutamate release that results in the sTDPs in darkness, and leTDPs in On, Off and After responses in ACs.",Excluded
4032,"Monocarboxylate transporter-4 depletion inhibits stemness, promotes DNA damage and radiosensitizes glioblastoma stem cells Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumor in adults, with a median survival for patients of 12-15 months after diagnosis. Standard therapy includes radiation and chemotherapy, with GBM recurrences refractory to second line treatments. Given the lack of therapeutic opportunities in GBM, new treatment strategies are urgently needed. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) have been shown to support GBM maintenance and exhibit enhanced resistance to ionizing radiation, a cornerstone of GBM therapy. Monocarboxylate transporter-4 (MCT4, SLC16A3) is highly expressed in the vast majority of GBMs and predominantly in cells that congregate in ""palisades"" around centers of necrosis or in cells where hypoxiainducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is expressed either due to reduced oxygen levels or other microenvironmental stresses. MCT4 appears to regulate proliferation, survival, and xenograft implantation of GSC neurosphere lines. Importantly, we found these effects to be independent of lactate homeostasis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of differentially expressed genes revealed an enrichment of DNA replication stress response pathways including cell cycle (G2/M checkpoint), DNA replication, DNA damage response (DDR), and cellular deoxyribonucleotide metabolism in MCT4-depleted GSCs. To validate these data, after lentiviral silencing of MCT4 expression in two GBM neurosphere lines, we examined DNA repair potential by assessing the resolution of yH2AX and by performing alkaline comet assays. In both assays, reduced MCT4 levels resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of nuclear foci (p < 0.0001) and in the percentage of cells with comet tails (p=0.0003), respectively, confirming that reduced MCT4 expression decreases cellular ability to repair DNA damage. Moreover, we show that conditional MCT4 depletion alone (p=0.0001) or in combination with ionizing radiation (p=0.0006) efficiently enhance survival of mice orthotopi- cally implanted with GSC-derived xenografts. We determined that MCT4 inhibition enhances the radiosensitivity of GBM and should be explored as a treatment strategy to complement conventional treatment.",Excluded

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Out of a retrospective cohort of 1380 subjects who underwent initial WB-CTP because of suspected stroke, we selected all patients with a supratentorial magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed ischemic infarction with a volume of 8 mL or less. Infratentorial lesions were excluded. The study was designed as a case-control study with a ratio of cases to controls with no infarction in follow-up magnetic resonance imaging of 1:3. Two blinded readers independently evaluated 4 different computed tomographic perfusion parameter data sets per subject with respect to the presence and localization of a perfusion deficit. RESULT(S): A total of 113 subjects met the inclusion criteria for the patient group. Overall, WB-CTP reached a sensitivity of 43.4% and a specificity of 92.9%. Among these, cortical infarctions were detected in 31 (69%) of 49 cases, whereas subcortical infarctions were detected only in 18 (28%) of 64 cases (P < 0.05). Mean final infarction diameter (17.3 mm) and volume (1.9 mL) of infarctions detected on CTP were significantly larger than those of infarctions not detected (12.4 mm and 0.8 mL, respectively; P < 0.001). Time from symptom onset did not differ significantly between infarctions that were detected or those that were not (204 vs 189 minutes; P = 0.75).

Leukemia cell sensitization to apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation is achieved by upregulation of ROS production and/or downregulation of antioxidative enzymes. Therefore, our aim was to analyze the potential role of fullerenol nanoparticle in modulation of the leukemic cellular response to irradiation. We used the qRT-PCR to analyze the expression level of mRNA for 11 genes in irradiated (IR) and FNP pre-treated irradiated cells (FNP + IR) K562 cells, and compared gene expression level with the overall cell survival, determined by DET and MTT assays. Interesting result of similar percentage of cell survival in FNP and FNP + IR groups (67.9% versus 63%), indicated the possible protective effect of FNP in irradiated cells. Under oxidative stress induced by radiation, cytoprotective genes such as GSTA4, MnSOD, NOS, CAT and HO-1 were upregulated in FNP pretreated K562 cells in comparison with control group, IR and FNP - treated non-irradiated cells. Amongst the antioxidative enzymes, only the mRNA of Cu, Zn - SOD (SOD-1) was downregulated, while gGT, GPX and GSTP1 were not significantly modulated in FNP-treated irradiated cells. Together with survival data and significant overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL genes, our results may indicate that FNP exerts cytoprotective function in K562 leukemic cells, rendering K562 cells more tolerant to radiotherapy.",Excluded

Hyperthermia for 30 min at a spinal cord temperature of 41.1, 42.3, and 42.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C was applied 5 to 10 min after irradiation by means of a 434 MHz microwave applicator. Animals were observed for 21 months while recording myelopathy and development of tumors.RESULTS: The latent period for hind leg paralysis decreased with increasing radiation dose from 359 +/- 31 days (n = 9) after 20 Gy to 200 +/- 4 days (n = 5) after 32 Gy. Hyperthermia enhanced the radiation response of the lumbosacral spinal cord as evidenced by shortening of the latent period for paralysis and a decrease in the biological effective dose. After 20 Gy followed by 30 min 41.1 degrees C, latency was diminished to 214 +/- 16 days (n = 7, p < 0.001 vs. 20 Gy alone). The ED50 was 21.1 Gy, which was diminished to values between 16 and 17 Gy if radiation was followed by hyperthermia, giving a thermal enhancement ratio between 1.24 and 1.32. Histopathological examination of the spinal cord after combined treatment of x-rays and hyperthermia showed necrosis of nerve roots. Irradiation with 16, 20, 24, and 28 Gy (n = 77) alone led to tumor induction in 17 +/- 8% of the animals (pooled data). If followed by hyperthermia (n = 96), it was increased to 33 +/- 12% (p < 0.01). Most tumors induced by radiation and hyperthermia were sarcomas.CONCLUSION: First, the radiation response of rat lumbosacral spinal cord was enhanced by heat. Second, latency for paralysis was shortened in the lower dose range. Third, no difference in pathology between x-rays alone or in combination with hyperthermia. Fourth, hyperthermia did increase radiation carcinogenesis.",Included
4594,"Gain of rod to horizontal cell synaptic transfer: relation to glutamate release and a dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium current We related rod to horizontal cell synaptic transfer to glutamate release by rods. Simultaneous intracellular records were obtained from dark-adapted rod-horizontal cell pairs. Steady-state synaptic gain (defined as the ratio of horizontal cell voltage to rod voltage evoked by the same light stimulus) was 3.35 +/- 0.60 for dim flashes and 1.50 +/- 0.03 for bright flashes. Under conditions of maintained illumination, there was a measurable increment of horizontal cell hyperpolarization for each light-induced increment of rod hyperpolarization over the full range of rod voltages. In separate experiments we studied glutamate release from an intact, light-responsive photoreceptor layer, from which inner retinal layers were removed. Steady light reduced glutamate release as a monotonic function of intensity; spectral sensitivity measures indicated that we monitored glutamate release from rods. The dependence of glutamate release on rod voltage was well fit by the activation function for a high-voltage-activated, dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type calcium current, suggesting a linear dependence of glutamate release on [Ca]i in the synaptic terminal. A simple model incorporating this assumption accounts for the steady-state gain of the rod to horizontal cell synapse.",Excluded
3936,"Skeletal muscle metastasis presenting as an initial manifestation of lung cancer INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer, the most common cancer worldwide, presents as a metastatic disease in majority of the cases. The most frequent sites of distant metastases are liver, adrenal glands, bones, and brain. Skeletal muscle metastasis as a mode of presentation of lung cancer is a rare phenomenon which is often discovered at autopsy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old male, with forty pack years history of smoking, presented with a painful right, distal thigh swelling for two months and unintentional weight loss of twenty pounds. Examination of right distal thigh revealed a tender, hard, non fluctuant mass, with surrounding erythema. Complete blood count, basic metabolic and hepatic function panel were unremarkable. Chest x ray showed large mass in right lower lobe with a smaller nodule in the right upper lobe which was confirmed by computed tomography ( CT) of the chest. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right lower extremity showed 5.5 x 4.0 x 6.2 cm soft tissue mass in lateral aspect of the distal thigh adjacent to femur. The patient underwent CT guided biopsies of the right lower lobe lung mass and the right thigh mass. Pathology of the lung mass revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (immunostaining positive for cytokeratin and thyroid transcription factor-1) and that of the right thigh mass revealed poorly differentiated malignant tumor most consistent with metastatic non small cell carcinoma (immunostaining positive for cytokeratin). Positron-emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) demonstrated hypermetabolic right lower lobe lung mass and right upper lobe lung nodule, a large right knee soft tissue mass and multiple hypermetabolic soft tissue lesions throughout the muscles of the body along with jugular, external iliac and inguinal hypermetabolic lymphadenopathies. The patient was started on palliative radiation to the right distal thigh. Chemotherapy was not administered due to rapidly deteriorating clinical status. The patient died of septic shock within 4 weeks of diagnosis. DISCUSSION: Skeletal muscle is an exceptionally rare site of metastasis of lung cancer(1). The local pH and the contractile property of skeletal muscle do not favor metastasis. Delay in the diagnosis may occur due to its clinical and radiological resemblance to diseases like abscess and soft tissue sarcoma. Definitive diagnosis requires biopsy of the muscle mass. Treatment is palliative, and majority of the patients die within 1 year of diagnosis (2,3) CONCLUSION(S): Lung cancer with skeletal muscle metastasis should be considered as a potential differential diagnosis in patients presenting with intramuscular mass.",Excluded
4519,"Inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase as a protective effect of nicaraven in ionizing radiation- and ara-C-induced cell death BACKGROUND: Nicaraven is a drug used for patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. It crosses the blood-brain barrier and has potent antivasospastic and brain-protective effects. While nicaraven scavenges the hydroxyl radical, the mechanism of its protection remains obscure. In addition to the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect, nicaraven also exhibits inhibitory action on poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The mechanism of the pharmacological action of nicaraven has not yet been clarified.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human myeloid HL-525 cells were exposed to ionizing radiation or hydrogen peroxide and the effect of nicaraven on the activation of the Egr-1 promoter was measured. Next, the action of the drug on DNA fragmentation and inhibition of thymidine uptake caused by the genotoxic stimulation of ionizing radiation or cytosine B-D-arabinofuranoside (ara-C) were assessed. Finally, direct inhibition of the PARP enzyme by nicaraven was measured.RESULTS: Nicaraven did not inhibit the activation of the Egr-1 promoter caused by H2O2 and the activation caused by ionizing radiation. However, the drug repressed DNA fragmentation and increased thymidine uptake dose-dependently. Nicaraven had a direct inhibitory effect on PARP.DISCUSSION: The effect of nicaraven on the Egr-1 promoter was different from that of another free-radical scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine. Nicaraven demonstrated similar protection of the PARP inhibitors including 3-aminobenzamide. Since nicaraven directly inhibits the PARP enzyme, the drug might be useful in oncology as well as in studying tissue-damaging conditions characterized by increased PARP activity.",Excluded
4273,"In vivo radiosensitizer effect of the HDAC inhibitor S78454 on orthotopic human glioblastoma Glioblastoma is an aggressive primary brain tumor with poor outcome, despite a treatment associating surgery and radiotherapy combined with temozolomide. Recent data have shown an in vitro synergy of the HDAC inhibitor S78454 (also called PCI- 24781) with ionizing radiation, via inhibition of homologous recombinational (HR) repair of DNA double-strand breaks. We propose in this study to investigate the in vivo radiosensitizer effect of S78454 on human glioblastoma model. For this, we generated orthotopic U87 human glioblastoma xenografts in nude mice. Intra-peritoneal (i.p.) S 78454 treatment was performed daily starting 10 days after the engraftment. Irradiation was performed in one daily 2 Gy localized fraction during 4 days followed by a second similar 4 days treatment performed after 3 days off (for a total dose of 16 Gy administrated on 11 days). Survival experiments were conducted in mice bearing xenografts in the four different groups of treatment (vehicle, S 78454 alone, radiation alone, S 78454 + radiation). Mice bearing orthotopic xenografts were sacrificed at the onset of neurological signs. Survival curves were then performed. We first determined the S78454 dosing schedule to obtain a pharmacodynamic effect of the compound in the xenograft. Inhibition of RAD 51 expression, histone H3 and tubulin acetylation in the tumor were obtained 24 hours after daily i.p. treatment with 50mg/kg S78454. These results allowed us to define the schedule treatment combining S78454 with radiotherapy: mice were treated with S78454 50 mg/kg/d i.p., daily from Days 10 to14 and then from Days 17 to 21; one 2 Gy fraction radiotherapy was performed daily from Days 11 to14 and Days 18 to 21. In these conditions of treatment, S78454 was well tolerated Survival of the mice treated with S78454 alone was not significantly increased while the survival of the mice treated with irradiation alone was significantly increased compared to the control group (P<0.05). In contrast, the survival of the mice treated with the combined treatment was significantly increased compared to the group of animals treated with irradiation alone (P<0.05) and to the group treated with S78454 alone (P<0.01). Effect of S78454 on angiogenesis will be presented. Our results demonstrate that the HDAC inhibitor S78454 radiosensitizes human glioblastoma in vivo and strongly suggest that S78454 may be an interesting drug to combine with radiotherapy in clinical trials for patients with glioblastoma.",Excluded
4234,"Up-regulation of the expression of cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide by electroacupuncture in the arcuate nucleus of diet-induced obese rats It was reported that acupuncture or electro-acupuncture (EA) is effective in reducing the body weight for obese patients, although the mechanisms remain obscure. In a previous study, we have found that rats fed with high-fat (HIF) diet developed diet-induced obesity (DIO) with a concomitant decrease in the hypothalamic content of the cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide, a peptide with anorexiogenic effect. To assess the central effect of EA on DIO rat, we revealed that EA up-regulated the expression of CART peptide in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the DIO rats. After feeding with HIF diet for 14 weeks, the DIO rats received EA stimulation three times per week for 4 weeks. The expression of CART peptide in ARC was measured using immunohistochemistry. The plasma ACTH was measured with ELISA. EA caused a reduction of both body weight and energy intake in DIO rats and increased the expression of CART peptide in ARC. The plasma ACTH was increased in response to restraint stress, but EA produced no further increase in ACTH levels. The results suggest that EA can up-regulate the expression of CART peptide to approach normal level, resulting in an inhibition of food intake and a reduction of body weight in DIO rats.",Excluded
4192,"Differences in the DNA supercoiling response of irradiated cell lines from ataxia-telangiectasia versus unaffected individuals In this study the manifestation of DNA damage at the nucleoid level was examined in several AT cell lines using an image analysis system to directly visualize and measure the changes in DNA loop size which occur when increasing concentrations of propidium iodide (PI) are used to titrate the DNA supercoiling response (the 'fluorescent halo assay'). This response consists of a relaxation (0.5-7.5 micrograms/ml PI) and rewinding phase (10-50 micrograms/ml PI), the latter of which is impaired by the presence of DNA strand breaks in irradiated cells. In addition to the inhibition of DNA rewinding seen immediately after irradiation at 0 degrees C, the supercoiling response of AT diploid fibroblasts indicated an increased amount of DNA unwinding compared to fibroblasts from unaffected individuals. This difference appeared to saturate, since the excess in DNA loop size over that seen in irradiated fibroblasts from unaffected individuals remained constant after 5 Gy. These results may reflect a greater instability of the DNA-nuclear matrix attachment points in irradiated AT fibroblasts. The DNA supercoiling response in irradiated transformed AT fibroblasts and AT lymphoblasts did not differ from that observed in unaffected cells of the same type. However, all of the immortalized cell lines (AT and unaffected) had inherently larger DNA loop sizes than diploid fibroblasts and exhibited excess unwinding after irradiation.",Excluded

4159,"Expression of Ndrg2 in the rat frontal cortex after antidepressant and electroconvulsive treatment Although the therapeutic action of antidepressants most likely involves the regulation of serotonergic and noradrenergic signal transduction, no consensus has been reached concerning their precise molecular or cellular mechanisms of action. In the present study, we demonstrated that chronic treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant (imipramine) and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (sertraline) reduced the expression of Ndrg2 mRNA and protein in the rat frontal cortex. Ndrg2 is a member of the N-Myc downstream-regulated genes. Interestingly, repeated ECT also significantly decreased Ndrg2 expression in this region of the brain. These data suggest that Ndrg2 may be a common functional molecule that is decreased after antidepressant treatment and ECT. Although, the functional role of Ndrg2 in the central nervous system remains unclear, our findings suggest that Ndrg2 may be associated with treatment-induced adaptive neural plasticity in the brain, a chronic target of antidepressant action. In conclusion, we have identified Ndrg2 as a candidate target molecule of antidepressants and ECT.",Excluded
4257,"Neuro-oncological applications of optical spectroscopy Advances in optics and molecular imaging have occurred rapidly in the past decade. One technique poised to take advantage of these developments is optical spectroscopy (OS). All optical spectroscopic techniques have in common tissue interrogation with light sources ranging from the ultraviolet (UV) to the infrared (IR) ranges of the spectrum, and collection of information on light reflected (reflectance spectroscopy) or light interactions with tissue and emergence at different wavelengths (fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy). OS can provide information regarding intrinsic tissue optical properties such as tissue structure, nuclear density, and the presence or absence of endogenous or exogenous fluorophores. Among other applications, this information has been used to distinguish tumor from normal brain tissues, to detect tumor margins in intrinsic, infiltrating gliomas, to identify radiation damage to tissues, and to assess tissue viability and predict the onset of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Potential applications of OS include detection of specific central nervous system (CNS) structures, such as brain nuclei, identification of cell types by the presence of specific neurotransmitters, and the detection of optically labeled cells or drugs during therapeutic interventions. All have potential utility in neuro-oncology, have been investigated in our laboratories, and will be the subject of this review. [References: 33]",Excluded

As a result of the examination, 603 persons (54.6%) made up a group at greater risk for cerebrovascular insufficiency. Arterial hypertension was found to be the leading risk factor while the age 45-49 years turned out most dangerous from the standpoint of the onset of the diseases under consideration. No relationship was established between the total dose of external radiation and the risk of the development of cerebrovascular disorders. 96 persons at greater risk for CVD were subjected to a thorough clinical and instrumental examination. Of these, 79.2% appeared to have initial manifestations of brain circulatory insufficiency and stage I dyscirculatory encephalopathy.",Included
4751,"Aggressive and malignant prolactin pituitary tumors: pathological diagnosis and patient management According to the World Health Organization classification of pituitary tumors, only tumors with systemic metastasis must be considered as carcinomas. Invasive tumors with multiple recurrences are only classified as aggressive tumors or ""atypical adenomas"". To illustrate the problems encountered in the pathological diagnosis of pituitary carcinoma and in patient management, we present two male patients operated on for an aggressive prolactin pituitary adenoma with and without metastasis. In case 1, 5 surgeries, 3 irradiations, increased doses of dopamine agonists, and trials of temozolomide and carboplatine-VP16 failed to control tumor progression and the appearance of metastases which lead to death 16 years after onset. In case 2, based on the initial diagnosis of an aggressive-invasive adenoma that was resistant to dopamine agonists, gamma-Knife irradiation was initially performed on the intra-cavernous remnant. Eight years after onset, the remnant remained stabilized and the plasma PRL normalized under dopamine agonist. From these 2 cases alongside other cases found in the literature, we propose that the association of certain clinical signs (male sex, dopamine-resistant hyperprolactinemia), radiological signs (invasive macro or giant tumor on MRI) and histological signs (angiogenesis, Ki-67 > 3%, p53 positive, mitoses >2 per high power field, vascular invasion, up-regulation of genes related to invasion and proliferation, and allelic loss of chromosome 11) might suggest aggressiveness and be suspicious of malignancy before the appearance of metastasis. The early detection of an aggressive phenotype of a prolactin pituitary tumor should permit the earlier establishment of the optimum therapeutic strategy associating surgery and radiotherapy to delay or inhibit metastasis.",Excluded
4318,"Focal, high dose, and fractionated modified stereotactic radiation therapy for lung carcinoma patients: a preliminary experience BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiation therapy is highly effective in the treatment of small brain metastases, regardless of the histology. This suggests that small extracranial malignancies may be curable with similar radiation therapy. The authors developed a novel treatment unit for administering such therapy.METHODS: The unit consisted of a linear accelerator (linac), an X-ray simulator (X-S), computed tomography (CT), and a table. The gantry axes of the three machines were coaxial and could be matched by rotating the table. Patients were instructed to perform shallow respiration with oxygen. The motion of the tumor was monitored with the X-S. When the motion was slight enough, the table was rotated to the CT. To include all geometric movement on the CT images, each scan was made while the patient was performing shallow respiration. After the CT positioning, the table was rotated to the linac, and non-coplanar treatment was given. Beginning in October 1994, 45 patients with 23 primary or 43 metastatic lung carcinomas were treated. Radiation doses at the 80% isodose line were 30-75 gray in 5-15 fractions over 1-3 weeks with or without conventional radiation therapy.RESULTS: The treatment was performed with no or minimal adverse acute symptoms. The daily treatment time was short. During a median follow-up of 11 months, local progression occurred in 2 of 66 lesions. Interstitial changes in the lung were limited.CONCLUSIONS: With this unit and procedure, focal radiation therapy similar to stereotactic radiation therapy is possible for extracranial sites. The preliminary experience appeared safe and promising, and further exploration of this approach is warranted.",Excluded
3663,"Virtual simulation: initial clinical results We have developed a graphics-based three-dimensional treatment design system that permits the physician to easily understand which anatomy will be treated for any arbitrary beam orientation. Our implementation of this system differs from others in that the software (the Virtual Simulator) simulates the full functionality of a (physical) radiation therapy simulator allowing it to be easily used by physicians. The details of the of our initial clinical experience with virtual simulation are presented in this paper. Virtual simulation was attempted in 71 patients and completed in 65. In 41/71 patients (58%), the beam orientations chosen differed significantly from those traditionally used in our department. Although virtual simulation lead to traditional radiation portals in the remaining patients, in 23/71 (32%) secondary blocking was designed which was different from that which would have been conventionally employed. Thus, overall, virtual simulation lead to treatment changes in 64/71 (90%) of the patients in whom it was attempted. In 78% of evaluable patients the treatment designed with virtual simulation could be implemented on the physical simulator with a precision of +/- 5 mm (+/- 3 mm for brain and head and neck). Thus virtual simulation allowed both accurate planning and execution of treatment plans that would be difficult to achieve with conventional methods.",Excluded
4169,"Acquisition of radioresistance by IL-6 treatment is caused by suppression of oxidative stress derived from mitochondria after gamma-irradiation Interleukin (IL)-6 is a multifunctional cytokine and is one of the radiation-induced bystander factors. This study aimed to clarify the mechanism of acquisition of radioresistance through the control of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by IL-6. We used a rat glioma cell line (C6) as tumor cells and a rat astrocyte cell line (RNB) as non-tumor cells. Our results showed that the surviving fraction of C6 cells after 6 Gy irradiation was increased by the addition of IL-6, but that this was not the case in RNB cells. In addition, the number of 53BP1 foci in C6 cells at 30 min after gamma-irradiation were decreased by IL-6. Levels of ROS in whole C6 cells, and superoxide in the mitochondria of C6 cells immediately after gamma-irradiation, were reduced by IL-6, but this was not observed in RNB cells. The mitochondrial membrane potential detected by JC-1 in C6 and RNB cells was inhibited by IL-6 alone. Therefore, it was concluded that IL-6 leads specifically to radioresistance in tumor cells by inhibition of increases in ROS after gamma-irradiation.",Included
4052,"Modulations of nerve growth factor and Bcl-2 in ultraviolet-irradiated human epidermis BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation to the skin causes apoptosis of keratinocytes. Melanocytes are more resistant to UV-induced apoptosis, due, in part, to high levels of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2. In vitro studies have shown that nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophic polypeptide, is produced by keratinocytes and exerts a protective role for melanocytes by upregulating Bcl-2. The purpose of this study was to determine NGF and Bcl-2 modulations in UV-irradiated human skin.METHODS: Nine volunteers were irradiated with two minimal erythema doses using solar-simulated UV irradiation. Seventy-two hours post irradiation, skin biopsies were obtained from irradiated and sun-protected skin. The skin specimens were stained with anti-tyrosinase-related protein-1 monoclonal antibody IgG2a (Mel-5), anti-Bcl-2 (monoclonal antibody IgG-kappa), and with anti-NGF (polyclonal antibody IgG).RESULTS: NGF staining was identified within the cytoplasm of epidermal melanocytes, similar to the staining observed for TRP-1 and Bcl-2. While no significant difference in the number of TRP-1- and Bcl-2-positive melanocytes was observed between irradiated and non-irradiated skin within 72 h, the number of NGF-positive melanocytes decreased significantly, 72 h after UV irradiation (p < 0.024). NGF was also identified within keratinocytes, and while non-irradiated skin exhibited cytoplasmic NGF staining throughout the epidermis, NGF staining was reduced in the lower epidermal layers after UV irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first in vivo study showing NGF to be present in melanocytes, as well as showing modulations of NGF and Bcl-2 in melanocytes, following solar-simulated UV irradiation.",Excluded

Within a trial comparing adjuvant radiotherapy versus active monitoring following surgical resection for an atypical meningioma (ROAM/EORTC-1308), we explored patterns in communication and reasons why health practitioners may find it challenging to convey equipoise and explore treatment preferences. Material(s) and Method(s): Qualitative study embedded within ROAM/EORTC-1308. Data were collected on 40 patients and 18 practitioners from 13 U.K. sites, including audio recordings of 39 patients' trial consultations, 23 patient interviews, and 18 practitioner interviews. Qualitative analysis drew on argumentation theory. Result(s): Practitioners acknowledged the importance of the research question that the trial aimed to answer. However, they often demonstrated a lack of equipoise in consultations, particularly with eligible patients who practitioners believed to be susceptible to side effects (e.g., cognitive impairment) or inconvenienced by radiotherapy. Practitioners elicited but rarely explored patient treatment preferences, especially if a patient expressed an initial preference for active monitoring. Concerns about coercing patients, loss of practitioner agency, and time constraints influenced communication in ways that were loaded against trial participation. Conclusion(s): We identified several challenges that practitioners face in conveying equipoise and exploring patient treatment preferences in oncology, and particularly neuro-oncology, trials with distinct management pathways. The findings informed communication about ROAM/EORTC-1308 and will be relevant to enhancing trial communication in future oncology trials. Qualitative studies embedded within trials can address difficulties with communication, thus improving informed consent and recruitment. ROAM/EORTC-1308 RCT: ISRCTN71502099. Implications for Practice: Oncology trials can be challenging to recruit to, especially those that compare treatment versus monitoring. Conveying clinical equipoise and exploring patient treatment preferences can enhance recruitment and patient understanding. This study focused on the challenges that practitioners encounter in trying to use such communication strategies and how practitioners may inadvertently impede patient recruitment and informed decision making. This article provides recommendations to support practitioners in balancing the content and presentation of trial management pathways. The results can inform training to optimize communication, especially for neuro-oncology trials and trials comparing markedly different management pathways. Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors.

Method(s): Table 1 lists our experimental production rates for [<sup>51</sup>Mn] and [<sup>52</sup>Mn]. To optimize the production rate of [<sup>51</sup>Mn], gold target plates were electroplated with a thin layer (5 mg, 2.8mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) of Cr-50 metal and irradiated with 14 MeV deuterons as an internal slant target in the CS30 cyclotron [1]. [<sup>52</sup>Mn] was obtained after irradiation of a cup target of vanadium metal [2].

Characteristics of patients and AVM related to hemorrhagic or nonhemorrhagic presentation were evaluated by logistic regression. Risk factors predicting AVM hemorrhage during the period from the diagnosis to GKS of AVM and during the latency period after radiosurgery were evaluated using Cox regression hazards model.RESULTS: The annual hemorrhage rate before GKS was 2.0% assuming patients were at risk for hemorrhage since their birth. The hemorrhage rate calculated between the diagnosis and GKS of AVM was 6.6% and reduced to 2.5% after GKS until obliteration of the AVM. Although small and deep nidi and those with deep and single draining veins tended to present themselves with hemorrhage, only nidi with single draining veins and those ruptured before were more likely to bleed once the AVM had been diagnosed. These factors no longer predisposed the nidus to a rupture after radiosurgery and the only predicting factor for hemorrhage was a low radiosurgical prescription dose to the margin of nidus.CONCLUSIONS: The AVM hemorrhage rate seems to reduce after GKS.

Material(s) and Method(s): All patients with single BM who underwent surgical resection followed by IFRT at our institution from 2006 to 2013 were evaluated. Local recurrence (LR)-free survival, distant failure (DF)-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were determined. Analyses were performed associating clinical variables with LR and DF. Salvage approaches and toxicity of treatment for each patient were also assessed. Result(s): Median follow-up was 19.1 months. Fifty-six patients were treated with a median dose of 40.05 Gy/15 fractions with IFRT to the resection cavity. LR-free survival was 91.4%, DF-free survival was 68.4%, and OS was 77.7% at 12 months. No variables were associated with increased LR; however, melanoma histopathology and infratentorial location were associated with DF on multivariate analysis. LRs were salvaged in 5/8 patients, and DFs were salvaged in 24/29 patients. Two patients developed radionecrosis. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant IFRT is feasible and safe for well-selected patients with surgically resected single BM. Acceptable rates of local control and salvage of distal intracranial recurrences continue to be achieved with continued follow-up.

Progesterone receptor immunoreactivity was detected in 70% of tumors. Estrogen receptor immunoreactivity was not detected. An inverse correlation was found between detection of progesterone receptors and the PFPCNA index. The overall 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 68%. The only prognostic factor that significantly affected PFS rate was the PFPCNA index. The 2-year PFS was 42% for tumors with a high PFPCNA index (value > or = 24%) and 91% for tumors with a low PFPCNA index (value < 24%). Tumors with a high PFPCNA index were 9.1 times as likely to recur as were tumors with a low PFPCNA index.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study confirms the value of irradiation for dogs with incompletely resected meningiomas. Prognostic value of the PFPCNA index suggests-that duration of treatment and interval from surgery to start of irradiation may affect outcome. Loss of progesterone receptors in some tumors may be responsible for an increase in PFPCNA index and may indirectly affect prognosis after radiation therapy.",Excluded
4814,"Combined effect of irradiation and B-vitamins deficiency on the voluntary alcohol consumption in rats The accidents in atomic electric stations took place in many countries. The most severe catastrophe was happened in 1986 in Ukraine. The population in Chernobyl region is suffering both from the consequences of irradiation and polyvitamine deficiency. Can it be related with the increased alcohol consumption observed in that region? To test this hypotheses we have studied the influence of the thiamine and folate deficiency and low dose irradiation and their combination on the voluntary alcohol consumption in rats. 80 adult male rats waiting 140-180 g. were preliminary tested in the conditions of free choice between 10% ethanol and water (triple, during 2 days). Then they were divided into 4 groups (on 20 animals) equal on the alcohol consumption and preference. 2 weeks later they were treated by hidrochythiamine (vitamin B1 antagonist, 1 mg/kg, s.c.) and metotrexate (folic acid antagonist, 200 mg/kg, s.c.) weekly, three times. 2 days following the every administration the some animals were treated by the gamma-irradiation (Co60, 0.25 gray). The groups were: 1- control (isotonic solution of NaCl); 2- irradiation alone; 3- antivitamins; 4- antivitamins + irradiations. Next day following the last irradiation half of animals from every group were sacrificed and vitamins status in their tissues was studied. Others were tested during 14 days individually in situation of free choice between 10% ethanol solution and water. In groups 2-4 the decreased transketolase activity (marker thiamine-dependent enzyme) and thiamine diphosphate level in blood, liver and brain as well as signs of folic deficiency were found. In groups 3 and 4 the alcohol preference index on the first week of post-irradiation testing period increased on 40.8 and 112.7% (p<0.05); on the second week on 19,1 and 81.4% (P <0.05) accordingly. In conclusion, the combination of low dose irradiation and B-vitamins deficiency increases the alcohol preference and consumption in rats. Those factors may be one of the reason of alcohol addiction also in population of Chernobyl region.",Included
4732,"Fractionated stereotactic conformal radiotherapy in the management of large chemodectomas of the skull base Purpose To evaluate the role of fractionated stereotactic conformal radiotherapy (FSRT) as a noninvasive method in the management of large chemodectomas of the skull base. Methods and materials Twenty-two patients with chemodectomas of the skull base were treated with FSRT at our institution. Ten patients received primary RT, and 12 patients were treated for recurrent or progressive disease after primary surgery (8 patients) or embolization (4 patients). The median total dose was 57.6 Gy, with a median of 1.8 Gy/fraction. The median target volume was 71.8 cm<sup>3</sup> (range, 10.5-212.2 cm <sup>3</sup>). The most common symptoms at the initial diagnosis were pulsatile tinnitus (16 patients), hearing loss (14 patients), and balance disturbance (14 patients). Twelve patients had additional cranial nerve deficits. Results The median follow-up was 5.7 years (range, 19-177 months). The actuarial overall survival rate was 89.5% at 5 and 10 years. The actuarial local control rate was 90.4% at 5 and 10 years. Seven patients (32%) had a partial response and 13 (59%) had stable disease of the irradiated chemodectoma. Two symptomatic patients developed recurrence after 19 and 32 months. Neurologic dysfunction improved or completely resolved in 59% and stabilized in 32%; 9% of patients experienced impairment of preexisting neurologic dysfunction. No patient developed new neurologic deficits after FSRT. RT was interrupted in 1 patient because of a maxillary bone abscess. In all other patients, no acute or late adverse reactions greater than Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 2 were seen. Conclusion Fractionated stereotactic conformal radiotherapy is an effective and well-tolerated noninvasive treatment for chemodectomas, with excellent tumor control rates and a low risk of morbidity. It is an option for patients at greater risk of microsurgical resection or with residual and recurrent tumors. Â© 2004 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3967,"Achieving sub cm CTV-PTV margin in pelvic treatments: Radiographers learning curve Aims: Image guidance is not always feasible or available for standard/ conformal treatments and so, offline portal image measurements help define population based CTV-PTV margins. Reproducibility in pelvis is aided by the use of ankle- and/or knee-indexed supports available in standard sizes generally suiting the needs of taller western patients. Radiographers need to be convinced of the importance for use of one/more positional devices as this adds to setup effort and time. Different permutations of aligning the pelvis and positional aids, resident supervised or not are reported for patients treated for cancer of the cervix/endometrium. Method(s): Patients were aligned using lasers/field lights to either anterior field center (conventional alignment) or to mid line tattoo over mons pubis keeping constant 10 cm table top to vertical height for all setups using either standard ankle or knee plus ankle positioning device. Localization CT scanbased digitally reconstructed radiographs were used as reference to compare with portal imaging acquired generally in pattern of 3 in 1st week and weekly thereafter. The van Herk formula was used to compute CTV-PTV margin from anterior and lateral image projections to give mediolateral (ML), cranio-caudal (CC) and antero-posterior (AP) margins. Result(s): The initial pelvic alignment were done in the presence of a resident doctor using ankle positioning by two different alignment methods: conventional and setup (4 cm cranial offset from reference tattoo at mons pubis). The corresponding PTV margin in ML direction was 1.6 cm versus 0.9 cm, CC 1.2 cm versus 1.1 cm respectively and in AP was identical at 0.7 cm. Subsequently, with radiographers by themselves, PTV margins were 1.1 cm versus 0.9 cm for ML, 1.1 cm versus 1.5 cm, CC and 1.0 cm versus 0.9 cm in AP direction for conventional and setup alignment respectively. An increase in CC margin was seen for setup arm. The radiographers were given feedback and setup reproducibility was assessed for next 13 patients treated with a similar setup protocol. The PTV margins for this group in CC showed improvement to 1.1 cm, ML was 0.9 cm and 0.9 cm in AP directions. A knee-positioning device was introduced with ankle for patient alignment with setup protocol. An increase in PTV margin to 1.4 cm was calculated for ML with modest decrease in CC at 0.8 cm and 0.9 cm for AP direction with use of two devices. The standard knee device was abandoned as use of two devices was perceived as cumbersome and unsuitable in height for patients. A third technique of alignment keeping treatment center at tattooed reference plane (mons pubis) using ankle device was studied. The PTV margins for ML, CC, AP directions were within a cm-0.8 cm, 0.9 cm, 0.9 cm respectively which is now the current practice. Conclusion(s): There is a radiographer learning curve. Changes in treatment practice spurring from new technologies require continuing education and feedback for radiographers to improvise their skills in setup reproducibility to optimize set-up in the patient.",Excluded

3735,"Potassium currents in isolated statocyst neurons and RPeD1 in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis To begin to determine the underlying neural mechanisms of memory formation, we studied two different cell types that play important roles in different forms of associative learning in Lymnaea. Statocyst neurons (hair cells) mediate classical conditioning, whereas RPeD1 is a site of memory formation induced by operant conditioning of aerial respiration. Because potassium (K(+)) channels play a critical role in neuronal excitability, we initiated studies on these channels in the aforementioned neurons. Three distinct K(+) currents are expressed in the soma of both the hair cells and RPeD1. In hair cells and RPeD1, there is a fast activating and rapidly inactivating 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-sensitive A current (I(A)), a tetraethyl ammonium (TEA)-sensitive delayed rectifying current, which exhibits slow inactivation kinetics (I(KV)), and a TEA- and 4-AP-insensitive Ca(2+)-dependent current (I(Ca-K)). In hair cells, the activation voltage of I(A); its half-maximal steady-state activation voltage and its half-maximal steady-state inactivation were at more depolarized levels than in RPeD1. The time constant of recovery from I(A) inactivation was slightly faster in hair cells. I(A) in hair cells is also smaller in amplitude than in RPeD1 and is activated at more depolarized potentials. In like manner, I(KV) is smaller in hair cells and is activated at more depolarized potentials than in RPeD1.",Excluded
4290,"Comparison of patient dose in two-dimensional carotid arteriography and three-dimensional rotational angiography BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is known that interventional neuroradiology (IN) involves high radiation dose to both patients and staff even if performed by trained operators using modern fluoroscopic X-ray equipment and dose-reducing technology. Therefore, every new technology or imaging tool introduced, such as three-dimensional rotational angiography (3D RA), should be evaluated in terms of radiation dose. 3D RA requires a series with a large number of images in comparison with 2D angiography and it is sometimes considered a high-dose IN procedure. The literature is scarce on the 3D RA radiation dose and in particular there are no data on carotid arteriography (CA). The aim of this study was to investigate patient dose differences between 2D and 3D CA.METHODS: The study included 35 patients undergoing 2D CA in hospital 1 and 25 patients undergoing 3D CA in hospital 2. Patient technical data collection included information on the kerma area product (KAP), fluoroscopy time (T), total number of series (S), and total number of acquired images (F).RESULTS: Median KAP was 112 Gy cm(2) and 41 Gy cm(2) for hospitals 1 and 2, respectively, median T was 8.2 min and 5.1 min, median S was 13 and 4, and median F was 247 and 242. Entrance surface air-kerma rate, as measured in ""medium"" fluoroscopy mode measured in 2D acquisition using a 20 cm phantom of polymethylmethacrylate, was 17.3 mGy/min for hospital 1 and 9.2 mGy/min for hospital 2.CONCLUSION: 3D CA allows a substantial reduction in patient radiation dose compared with 2D CA, while providing the necessary diagnostic information.",Excluded

4077,"Patterns of Failure after Stereotactic Radiosurgery of the Resection Cavity Following Surgical Removal of Brain Metastases BACKGROUND: Whole brain radiation treatment (WBRT) is considered standard treatment for BM. However, exposing large volumes of normal brain tissue to irradiation can cause neurotoxicity. This study describes our experience with 100 consecutive patients with brain metastases who were managed with surgical extirpation followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the resection cavity.METHODS: Patients with 1-3 brain metastases (BM), who underwent resection of 1-2 BM between June 2005 and December 2013, were treated with SRS directed to the tumor cavity and for any synchronous BM. Local and distant treatment failures were determined based on neuroimaging. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for local and distant failure rates and overall survival.RESULTS: One hundred and two resection cavities were treated with SRS in 100 consecutive patients. Thirty-two additional synchronous metastases were treated in 27 patients during the same session. The median overall survival was 18.9 months. Local control rate at 1 year was 84%. Longer delays between surgery and SRS were associated with increased risk of local failure (hazard ratio, -1.46; P = 0.02). Distant progression occurred in 44% of the patients at a mean of 8.8 +/- 6.6 months after SRS treatment. Ten cases of leptomeningeal spread occurred around the resection cavities (9.8%). Central nervous system failure was not significantly associated with survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that recursive partitioning analysis and active systemic disease were significantly associated with survival.CONCLUSION: The strategy described provides acceptable local disease control when compared with WBRT following surgery. This approach can delay and even annul WBRT in the majority of selected BM patients, especially recursive partitioning analysis class I patients. SRS should be scheduled as soon as possible after surgery.",Excluded

Most of them were exposed to the doses of radiation meeting criteria of so-called ""low doses"": 5 - 100 cGy. The impact of these doses on human health is not fully researched; mainly it refers to mental disorders. The purpose of our study was to investigate the clinical and pathological patterns of formation of mental disorders in liquidators exposed to ""low doses"" of radiation because of the Chernobyl accident. A group of 500 liquidators was examined in a continuous research during 1995-1999 and in 2000-2001. Clinical, clinicalpsychological and psychophysiological methods were mainly used; biochemical blood analysis and functional studies also were used. Change in clinical parameters and survey results were observed in the dynamics. Primary morbidity: a separate group of ""cerebrovascular disorders"" was highlighted. In 1989 it accounted for 14 % of primary morbidity, digestive diseases - 9%, and respiratory diseases - 45 %. In 1994, vascular disorders accounted for 43 %, respiratory diseases - 7% , and the digestive diseases - 25; In 1998 cerebral vascular disorders took first place in the primary morbidity, alongside with the increase of combined diverse classes ""neoplasm"", ""endocrine system disorders"" and ""blood diseases"". Disability: In 1990 cerebrovascular disorders occupied 37 % of all cases of disability, in 1993 - 84% of all disability. These disorders consisted of 90% cerebral disorders and had a tendency to deteriorate over time. We have shown that by the year 1998-1999 the psychoorganic syndrome was presented in 65% of liquidators, and in 83% of cases because of the cerebral vascular disorders. The following clinical forms were described: affective (80%), psychopathic (14.8%), and dementic (5.2%). Over time among the liquidators the number of diseases of various organs and systems are increasing. Among these diseases, cerebrovascular disease comes first; organic CNS lesion (radiation encephalopathy) results in clinically detectable psychoorganic syndrome in the major group of examined liquidators. Thus, it can be concluded that even ""low doses"" of radiation are danger for mental health and its effect grows over time.",Included

Heavy ion RT has been used in the treatment of various tumours, especially for radioresistant tumours mediated by hypoxia, localized near organs at risk. Most of these treatments are concentrated in deep-seated tumours such as those of the brain, head, lung, liver, rectum and urogenital organs, and treatment of skin carcinomas is limited.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the outcome and toxicity after carbon ion RT for skin carcinomas at the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou, China.METHODS: Between November 2006 and March 2009, 45 patients with skin carcinoma [squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (n = 16), basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (n = 12), malignant melanoma (MM) (n = 7), Bowen disease (n = 8) and Paget disease (n = 2)] were treated with carbon ion RT within a clinical Phase I trial. Patients received total doses of 60-70 GyE for SCC and BCC, 61-75 GyE for MM, 60 GyE for Bowen disease and 42.5 GyE for Paget disease, administered in 6-11 fractions over 6-11 days, with a fraction dose of 7-10 GyE.RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 24 months, range 12-36 months.

4066,"Cancer therapy, vomiting, and antiemetics Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy for cancer are capable of causing nausea and vomiting. With both treatment modalities, the nausea and vomiting is thought to be a second-order process rather than being due to direct stimulation of neuromechanisms that control vomiting. Both a peripheral (gastrointestinal tract) and central (chemoreceptor trigger zone) effect may be operating with both radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-induced vomiting. With radiotherapy, gastrointestinal toxicity is affected by the type of radiation, radiation dose and field size, fractionation schedule, individual patient factors, and the part of the patient that is radiated. Many different factors also influence the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy. With both radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting is probably mediated by a reduction in breakdown of various neurotransmitters. It is presumed that as the levels of neurotransmitters increase, nausea and vomiting develop. Antagonists of these neurotransmitters may afford some antiemetic protection. Nausea and vomiting may be so severe in patients with cancer that they may refuse potentially curative therapy because of it. Anticipatory nausea and vomiting may develop in patients who have become quite sick after receiving treatment. Exposure to stimuli associated with the emetogenic agent is then sufficient to trigger nausea and vomiting. Standard antiemetics do not help anticipatory nausea and vomiting, although behavioural training may. A variety of different drugs have proven useful as antiemetics, including dopamine antagonists such as phenothiazines, metoclopramide, corticosteroids (dexamethasone and methylprednisolone), cannabinoids, and benzodiazapines. Antihistamines and anticholinergics are of value in some situations. New serotonin antagonists appear to be very promising and are currently undergoing clinical studies. Multiagent antiemetic regimens appear to be more effective than single agent regimens in some situations. [References: 123]",Excluded
4737,"A Novel Validated Recurrence Risk Score to Guide a Pragmatic Surveillance Strategy After Resection of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors: An International Study of 1006 Patients OBJECTIVE: Despite heterogeneous biology, similar surveillance schemas are utilized after resection of all pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). Given concerns regarding excess radiation exposure and financial burden, our aim was to develop a prognostic score for disease recurrence to guide individually tailored surveillance strategies.METHODS: All patients with primary nonfunctioning, nonmetastatic well/moderately differentiated PanNETs who underwent curative-intent resection at 9-institutions from 2000 to 2016 were included (n = 1006). A Recurrence Risk Score (RRS) was developed from a randomly selected derivation cohort comprised of 67% of patients and verified on the validation-cohort comprised of the remaining 33%.RESULTS: On multivariable analysis, patients within the derivation cohort (n = 681) with symptomatic tumors (jaundice, pain, bleeding), tumors >2 cm, Ki67 >3%, and lymph node (LN) (+) disease had increased recurrence. Each factor was assigned a score based on their weighted odds ratio that formed a RRS of 0 to 10: symptomatic = 1, tumor >2 cm = 2, Ki67 3% to 20% = 1, Ki67 >20% = 6, LN (+) = 1. Patients were grouped into low- (RRS = 0-2; n = 247), intermediate-(RRS = 3-5; n = 204), or high (RRS = 6-10; n = 9)-risk groups. At 24 months, 33% of high RRS recurred, whereas only 2% of low and 14% of intermediate RRS recurred. This persisted in the validation cohort (n = 325).CONCLUSIONS: This international, novel, internally validated RRS accurately stratifies recurrence-free survival for patients with resected PanNETs. Given their unique recurrence patterns, surveillance intervals of 12, 6, and 3 months are proposed for low, intermediate, and high RRS patients, respectively, to minimize radiation exposure and optimize cost/resource utilization.",Excluded
3908,"Fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy improves symptoms from cranial neuropathies in base of skull meningiomas: The Jefferson experience Purpose/Objective(s): Skull base meningiomas commonly present with cranial neuropathies and are difficult to manage due to their location.We review the experience at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital using fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT) in the management of these patients with a focus on symptom outcomes. Materials/Methods:We identified 219 patients who were treated with FSRT for base of skull meningioma from 1/1/1994 through 3/1/2009. Seven patients received a second course of radiation therapy. We analyzed each treatment course separately, and classified treatments into four groups: RT only, adjuvant RT, RT for progression after surgery, and Re-irradiation after progression (with or without prior surgery). Symptoms were classified based on the cranial nerve affected. The gross target volume (GTV) was defined by T1-weighted MRI with contrast without inclusion of dural tails. The median prescription dose was 52.2 Gy (range 10 - 60 Gy). Patients were treated using multi-isocenter plans (median 79% isodose line) until 2004, and subsequently with single isocenter plans (median 90% isodose line). Cox proportional hazards models were used to indentify factors associated with progression, and multiple logistic regression was used to identify predictors of symptom improvement. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 3.1 years. Of 226 FSRT treatment courses, 116 were in the (51%) RT only group, 40 (18%) in the adjuvant RT group, 59 (26%) in the RT for progression after surgery group, and 11 (5%) in the re-irradiation after progression group. Patients were symptomatic at the time of radiation in 92% of cases. The most common symptoms were visual field and/or acuity deficits (55%), impaired extra-ocular movements (32%), and facial numbness (20%). Twenty-one patients progressed after FSRT. Local control rate at 5 years was 95.4% in the RTonly group, 89.8% in the adjuvant group (p=0.98), 74.3% in the progression after surgery group (p = 0.02), and 50% in the re-irradiation group (p<0.01). On multivariate analysis, prior radiation therapy (HR 3.68 p = 0.045) and midline/bilateral location (HR 2.65 p = 0.04) were significant predictors of progression; of note, treatment volume, fraction size and dose did not predict for progression. Of all patients symptomatic at presentation, 50.7% had subjective improvement in at least one symptom, and occurred at a median of 4.0 months. These improvements were durable in 82%-100% of cases, depending on cranial nerve involved. Only prior surgery (OR 0.48 95% CI 0.28 - 0.81) was associated with symptom improvement. Conclusion(s): Fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy is an effective modality for treatment of base of skull meningiomas and frequently results in symptom improvement.",Excluded
4514,"Cellular telephone use and risk of intratemporal facial nerve tumor OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Microwave radiation exposure from cellular telephone use has been implicated in the development of intracranial tumors. The intratemporal facial nerve (IFN) is exposed to higher levels of cellular telephone radiation than intracranial tissues. The purpose of the study was to determine whether cellular telephone use is associated with an increased risk of IFN tumors.STUDY DESIGN: Case-control using a structured telephone survey at an academic, tertiary-care referral center.METHODS: Patients with IFN tumors (n = 18) were case-matched with patients treated for acoustic neuroma (n = 51), rhinosinusitis (n = 72), and dysphonia or gastroesophageal reflux disease (n = 69). Risk of facial nerve tumorigenesis was compared by extent of cellular telephone use and other risk factors.RESULTS: The odds ratio of developing an IFN tumor was 0.6 (95% CI, 0.2-1.9) with any handheld cellular telephone use and 0.4 (95% CI, 0.1-2.1) with regular cellular telephone use. No factors were associated with an increased risk for IFN tumor development.CONCLUSIONS: Regular cellular telephone use does not appear to be associated with a higher risk of IFN tumor development. The short duration of widespread cellular telephone use precludes definite exclusion as a risk for IFN tumor development.",Excluded
4293,"Imaging-based outcomes for 24 gy in 2 daily fractions for patients with de novo spinal metastases treated with spine stereotactic body radiation therapy: An emerging standard Purpose/Objective(s): Currently, there is no consensus fractionation scheme for spine SBRT. We report mature outcomes for a cohort of patients with no prior radiation (de novo) treated with 24 Gy in 2 daily fractions, which represents an emerging Canadian standard. Purpose/Objective(s): The cohort consisted of 279 de novo spinal metastases in 145 consecutive patients treated with 24 Gy in 2 SBRT fractions, between 2009 and 2015, identified from a prospective database. All vertebral segments were treated with an institutionally standardized Linac-based approach using cone-beam CT image guidance and six degrees-of-freedom online setup correction. The endpoints were overall survival (OS), local control (LC), and the rate of vertebral compression fractures (VCF). OS rates were obtained using Kaplan-Meier methods and cumulative incidences of LC and VCF were obtained from competing risk analysis using death as a competing risk event. Evaluation of tumor control was based on serial spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as per the SPIne response assessment in Neuro-Oncology (SPINO) criteria recommendations. Result(s): The median follow-up was 17.0 months (range, 0.1-71.6 months). The 1-year and 2-year OS rates were 73.1% and 60.7%, respectively. Presence of epidural disease (P < 0.0001), lung (P = 0.0415) and renal cell (P < 0.0001) primary histologies and diffuse spinal metastatic disease as opposed to oligometastatic disease (P = 0.0034) were significant prognostic factors. The 1-year and 2-year LC rates were 90.3% and 82.4%, respectively, and the median time to local failure (LF) was 9.2 month (range, 0.4-31.3 months). Only the presence of epidural disease predicted for LF (P < 0.0001). The cumulative risk of VCF at 1 and 2 years were 8.5% and 13.8%, respectively. Lytic (P = 0.0143) or mixed lytic/blastic (P = 0.0214) lesions, spinal misalignment (P = 0.0121), and the dose to 90% of the planning target volume (PTVD90) (P = 0.0085) were significant predictors of VCF. Conclusion(s): Twenty-four Gy in 2 daily fractions is safe and effective in achieving high tumor control rates for de novo spinal metastases. This fractionation scheme is currently the standard SBRT arm on an ongoing Phase 3 randomized Canadian national trial (CCTG-SC 24) comparing it to a conventional radiation dose of 20 Gy delivered in 5 daily fractions.",Excluded
4327,"Linear accelerator radiosurgery in the treatment of brain metastases OBJECTIVE: To review a 12-year experience treating metastatic brain disease with linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients treated between 1989 and 2001 with linear accelerator radiosurgery for brain metastases. Patients were followed up both clinically and with imaging studies to document local control, regional control, and survival. Demographic data, dosing parameters, number of lesions, histology, history of whole-brain radiation therapy, and other factors were obtained prospectively. Cox proportional-hazards regression with multivariate and univariate analysis was performed with Stata 8.0 software.RESULTS: A total of 383 patients received SRS for brain metastases during the study interval. Median survival was 9 months. Patients with tumor-type melanoma or multiple metastatic lesions had decreased survival. Actuarial 1-year local control was 75%. Differences in regional control rates were not statistically significant between patients treated with SRS and whole-brain radiation therapy versus SRS alone.CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is an effective and safe method for treating selected patients with brain metastases.",Excluded
4149,"X-irradiation causes a prolonged reduction in cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of adult rats The effects of X-irradiation on proliferating cells in the dentate subgranular zone were assessed in young adult Fisher 344 rats exposed to a range of X-ray doses and followed for up to 120 days. Apoptosis was quantified using morphology and end-labeling immunohistochemistry, and cell proliferation was detected using antibodies against the thymidine analog BrdU and the cyclin-dependent kinase p34(cdc2). Radiation-induced apoptosis occurred rapidly, with maximum morphological and end-labeling changes observed 3-6h after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation cell proliferation was significantly reduced relative to sham-irradiated controls. The number of apoptotic nuclei increased rapidly with radiation dose, reaching a plateau at about 3Gy. The maximum number of apoptotic nuclei was substantially higher than the number of proliferating cells, suggesting that non-proliferating as well as proliferating cells in the subgranular zone were sensitive to irradiation. Subgranular zone cell proliferation was significantly reduced relative to age-matched controls 120 days after doses of 5Gy or higher. These findings suggest that neural precursor cells of the dentate gyrus are very sensitive to irradiation and are not capable of repopulating the subgranular zone at least up to 120 days after irradiation. This may help explain, in part, how ionizing irradiation induces cognitive impairments in animals and humans.",Included
4489,"Comparison of tumor volume delineation on magnetic resonance/ positron emission tomography versus standard computed tomography for head and neck cancer: Is there added value? Purpose/Objective(s): Computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are commonly used in head and neck radiation treatment planning. Combined MRI and PET (MR/PET) offers the advantage of simultaneous acquisition of multimodality biological information and possibly improved spatial resolution. In this study we assessed the added value of gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation on MR/PET compared to the standard practice of GTV delineation on CT. Materials/Methods: We prospectively enrolled patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with chemoradiation therapy in an institutional review board-approved study. We performed 2 pretreatment scans: contrast-enhanced planning CT and gadolinium-enhanced MR/PET. Primary and nodal CT-based GTVs (GTV-CT) were delineated on planning CT scans. Treatments were delivered based on these volumes. Primary and nodal MR/PET-based tumor volumes were delineated retrospectively after treatment completion using anatomic MRI and metabolic PET information to form a biologic tumor volume (MRBTV). MRBTVs were delineated without knowledge of the GTV-CT (BM, AF). Accuracy of MRBTV contours was assessed by a neuroradiologist (BH). MR/PET scans were registered to planning CT scans and the MRBTV was transferred. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), a validated metric to evaluate spatial overlap, was calculated from the intersection and union of the GTV-CT (planning CT) and MRBTV (MR/PET). A DSC of 0.7 or greater was considered a ""good"" overlap. Doses received by the GTV-CT and MRBTV were compared. Result(s): Twelve patients completed a pretreatment planning CT and MR/PET. Primary disease site was oropharynx in 11 patients and larynx in 1 patient. Ten pts had evaluable primary tumor GTVs and 8 had evaluable nodal GTVs. For the primary GTV, mean GTV-CT was 12.9 mL and MRBTV was 13.3 mL. Mean primary GTV/BTV intersection was 8.1 mL, with a Dice ratio of 0.4. Dose received by at least 95% of the tumor volume (D95%) was 65.8 Gy for the primary GTV-CT versus 65.7 Gy for the primary MRBTV. For the nodal GTV, mean GTV-CT was 29.7 mL and MRBTV was 29.2 mL. Mean nodal MRBTV intersection was 19.7 mL with a Dice ratio of 0.5. D95% was 62.9 Gy for the nodal GTV-CT versus 61 Gy for the nodal MRBTV. Conclusion(s): MRBTV volumes were similar to GTV-CT but the spatial overlap was moderate. Despite only moderate spatial overlap, radiation dose received by the MRBTV was similar to that received by the GTV-CT. Most patients in our study had oropharyngeal primaries, for which the added sophistication of MRPET may not improve the quality of GTV delineation. MR/PET may show added value for primary tumors that are more difficult to delineate on CT, such as sinonasal, nasopharyngeal, and base of skull tumors.",Excluded
4758,"Radiation-induced DNA damage in tumors and normal tissues. II. Influence of dose, residual DNA damage and physiological factors in oxygenated cells Detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors is important for many experimental and clinical situations. Several laboratories, including ours, have suggested that assays which measure radiation-induced DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) might be used to detect or quantify hypoxic cells in tumors and normal tissues. Recently, we demonstrated the feasibility of using an alkaline elution assay that measures strand breaks and DPCs to detect and/or quantify hypoxic cells in tissues. For this approach to be valid, DPCs must not be formed to any great extent in irradiated oxygenated cells, and the formation and repair of strand breaks and DPCs in oxygenated cells must not be modified appreciably by physiological factors (e.g. temperature, pH and nutrient depletion) that are often found in solid tumors. To address these issues, two sets of experiments were performed. In one set of experiments, oxygenated 9L cells in tissue culture, subcutaneous 9L tumors and rat cerebella were irradiated with doses of 15 or 50 Gy and allowed to repair until the residual strand break damage was low enough to detect DPCs. In another set of experiments, oxygenated exponentially growing or plateau-phase 9L cells in tissue culture were irradiated with a dose of 15 Gy at 37 or 20 degrees C, while the cells were maintained at a pH of either 6.6 or 7.3. DNA-protein crosslinks were formed in oxygenated cells about 100 times less efficiently than in hypoxic cells. In addition, temperature, pH, nutrient depletion and growth phase did not appreciably alter the formation and repair of strand breaks or the formation of DPCs in oxygenated 9L cells. These results support the use of this DNA damage assay for the detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors.",Included

The radiation response was evaluated in terms of regrowth delay; estimates of in situ cell survival were made by back-extrapolation of regrowth curves. These studies showed no significant difference in the effectiveness of single as compared to split dose irradiation i.e. no sparing effect of fractionation. If MTS constitute a realistic model for micrometastases in vivo, these results provide a radiobiological rationale for hyperfractionated treatment regimes in the adjuvant radiotherapy of neuroblastoma.",Excluded
4119,"Clinical and molecular recursive partitioning analysis of high-grade glioma treated with IMRT Introduction: Despite multimodal treatment for high-grade gliomas, prognosis remains grim. Prior Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RTOG-RPA) reports indicate based on pretreatment and treatment-related factors, a subset of patients experience a significantly improved survival. Since the development of the RTOG-RPA, high-grade gliomas have seen the widespread introduction of temozolomide and tumor oncogenetics. Here we aimed to determine whether the RTOG-RPA retained prognostic significance in the context of modern treatment, as well as generate an updated RPA incorporating both clinical and genetic variables. Method(s): Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) between 2004 and 2017 were reviewed. The primary endpoint was overall survival from date of diagnosis. Primary analysis compared actual survival rates to that expected of corresponding RTOG-RPA class. Secondary analysis utilized the rpart function to recursively partition overall survival by numerous clinical and genetic pretreatment and treatment-related variables. A tertiary analysis recursively partitioned a subset of patients in which the status of all genetic markers were known. Result(s): We identified 878 patients with histologically proven high-grade glioma treated with IMRT and 291 patients in our genetic subset. Median overall survival for the entire cohort was 14.2 months (95% confidence interval, 13.1-15.3). Applying the RTOG-RPA to our cohort validated the relative prognostic ordering of the survival classes except class II. Generating our new RPA created 7 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, chi 2 =584) with median survival ranging from 96.4 to 2.9 months based on age, histology, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, radiation fractions, tumor location, radiation dose, temozolomide status, and resection status. Our second RPA of our genetic subset generated 5 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, chi 2 =166) with survival ranging from 65.3 to 5.6 months based on age, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation status, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, neurological functional classification, hospitalization during IMRT, temozolomide status, and Karnofsky performance status. Conclusion(s): The RTOG-RPA retains partial prognostic significance, however, should be updated to reflect recent advancements. This series represents a large RPA analyzing both clinical and genetic factors and generated 7 distinct survival classes. Further assessment of patients with fully available genetic markers generated 5 distinct survival classes. These survival classifications need to be validated by a prospective data set and compared against the RTOG-RPA to determine whether they provide improved prognostic power.

4160,"Evaluation of QOL and psychological response in patients treated with palliative radiotherapy Purpose or Objective Usually, evaluation of palliative radiotherapy is made by physical findings or levels of pain relief. But little is known about patient quality of life (QOL), psychophysiological response, and assessment of adverse effect from the view point of QOL. We evaluated the effects of palliative radiotherapy for cancer recurrence or metastasis on patient QOL and psychophysiology. Material and Methods A total of 67 patients who received palliative radiotherapy between 2014 and 2015 were enrolled. Patient diseases were bone metastasis in 51 patients, lymph node metastasis in 7 patients, brain metastasis in 2 patients, local recurrence in 3 patients, and the others in 4 patients. Median irradiated dose was 30 Gy in 10 fractions for palliative radiotherapy. We used the questionnaires EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-C15-PAL to evaluate patient QOL and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate patient mental healthcare at the start and at the end of radiotherapy. Results As compared to scores at the start of radiotherapy, at the end of radiotherapy, numerical rating scale (NRS) and face scale significantly decreased. On the other hand, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) did not show no changes during palliative radiotherapy. In functional scales, average scores of role functioning (RF2) and emotional functioning (EF) also improved. In symptom scales, average scores of fatigue (FA), pain (PA), and insomnia (SL) improved. In bone metastasis group, global health status / QOL (QL2), PA, and SL significantly improved. After palliative radiotherapy, anxiety score of HADS was elevated below age of 70 years. There was relationship between anxiety improvement and QOL improvement after palliative radiotherapy. Nausea and vomiting scores of EORTC-QLQC15- PAL were associated with the irradiated volume of palliative radiotherapy for pelvic region. Conclusion Patient QOL of was improved by palliative radiotherapy regardless of PS.

These were also discussed in open session at the 16th International Leksell Gamma Knife Society Meeting in Sydney, Australia, in March 2012 and approved subject to certain revisions and the performance of an Internet vote for approval from the whole Society. This ballot was undertaken in September 2012.RESULTS: The recommendations in relation to volumes are that Gross Target Volume (GTV) should replace Target Volume (TV); Prescription Isodose Volume (PIV) should generally be used; the term Treated Target Volume (TTV) should replace TVPIV, GTV in PIV, and so forth; and the Volume of Accepted Tolerance Dose (VATD) should be used in place of irradiated volume. For dose prescription and measurement, the prescription dose should be supplemented by the Absorbed Dose, or DV% (for example, D95%), the maximum and minimum dose should be related to a specific tissue volume (for example, D2% or preferably D1 mm3), and the median dose (D50%) should be recorded routinely. The Integral Dose becomes the Total Absorbed Energy (TAE). In the assessment of planning quality, the use of the Target Coverage Ratio (TTV/ GTV), Paddick Conformity Index (PCI = TTV2/[GTV . PIV]), New Conformity Index (NCI = [GTV . PIV]/TTV2), Selectivity Index (TTV/PIV), Homogeneity Index (HI = [D2% -D98%]/D50%), and Gradient Index (GI = PIV0.5/PIV) are reemphasized. In relation to the dose to Organs at Risk (OARs), the emphasis is on dose volume recording of the VATD or the dose/volume limit (for example, V10) in most cases, with the additional use of a Maximum Dose to a small volume (such as 1 mm3) and/or a Point Dose and Mean Point Dose in certain circumstances, particularly when referring to serial organs. The recommendations were accepted by the International Leksell Gamma Knife Society by a vote of 92% to 8%.CONCLUSIONS: An agreed-upon and uniform terminology and subsequent standardization of certain methods and procedures will advance the clinical science of stereotactic radiosurgery.",Excluded

Ten of them were treated prospectively with a radiation-chemotherapy protocol. All but four specimens were recently reexamined and classified according to the Working Formulation system. The predominant histologic types were diffuse large cell type, large cell immunoblastic type, and diffuse mixed small and large cell type, seen in 38%, 21% and 21% of cases, respectively. Before 1980, 16 patients were treated with postoperative radiation without definite chemotherapy, and only one has survived more than 5 years. Local recurrence was the most common cause of failure. In 1981, the authors started a protocol in which four to six courses of systemic chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (VEPA) was given after whole brain radiation (30-40 Gy) with a local boost up to 50 to 60 Gy. Eight patients completed this protocol, and all of them are alive at 16 to 100 months after diagnosis, with three patients surviving more than 5 years. Only one patient developed recurrence. On the other hand, six patients who did not complete or receive chemotherapy after 1981 are dead or alive with recurrence. Corelation between the Working Formulation subtype and prognosis was not clear because of the variety of treatment. Two patients receiving chemotherapy developed brain necrosis, which was fatal in one case, and the other two patients treated with the protocol are in a poor state without signs of recurrence. Chemotherapy may enhance the radiation effect on normal brain tissue as well as tumor. Combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy can improve the survival rate, but the optimal dosage needs to be investigated further.",Excluded

In this study, the relationship between the [ F]-FET-PET parameters, distribution of restricted (mainly intracellular) and unrestricted (mainly extracellular) sodium, and the mutational status of the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) were investigated in patients with cerebral gliomas. Methodik/Methods: Ten patients with untreated gliomas and one patient with a recurrent glioblastoma were investigated by dynamic [ F]-FETPET and sodium MRI using an enhanced SISTINA sequence to estimate sodium parameters in tumours. The enhanced SISTINA sequence uses single-quantum and triple-quantum-filtered imaging and allows simultaneous acquisition of signal originating from restricted and unrestricted sodium (1). IDH mutational status was determined after biopsy or resection. The untreated patients were analysed independently in two groups (5 patients each) dependent on their IDH mutational status. Ergebnisse/Results: Tumour-to-brain ratio (TBR) of weighted mainly intracellular sodium (NaR) was significantly lower in IDH mutated (p = 0.01) than in IDH wildtype gliomas. Total sodium concentration in mmol/L (p = 0.05), TBR of the total sodium concentration (NaT) (p = 0.02), TBR of weighted unrestricted mainly extracellular sodium (NaNR) (p = 0.003), and the ratio of NaT/NaR (p < 0.001) were significantly higher in IDH mutated than in IDH wildtype gliomas.

3824,"Wwox-Brca1 interaction: role in DNA repair pathway choice In this study, loss of expression of the fragile site-encoded Wwox protein was found to contribute to radiation and cisplatin resistance of cells, responses that could be associated with cancer recurrence and poor outcome. WWOX gene deletions occur in a variety of human cancer types, and reduced Wwox protein expression can be detected early during cancer development. We found that Wwox loss is followed by mild chromosome instability in genomes of mouse embryo fibroblast cells from Wwox-knockout mice. Human and mouse cells deficient for Wwox also exhibit significantly enhanced survival of ionizing radiation and bleomycin treatment, agents that induce double-strand breaks (DSBs). Cancer cells that survive radiation recur more rapidly in a xenograft model of irradiated breast cancer cells; Wwox-deficient cells exhibited significantly shorter tumor latencies vs Wwox-expressing cells. This Wwox effect has important consequences in human disease: in a cohort of cancer patients treated with radiation, Wwox deficiency significantly correlated with shorter overall survival times. In examining mechanisms underlying Wwox-dependent survival differences, we found that Wwox-deficient cells exhibit enhanced homology directed repair (HDR) and decreased non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair, suggesting that Wwox contributes to DNA DSB repair pathway choice. Upon silencing of Rad51, a protein critical for HDR, Wwox-deficient cells were resensitized to radiation. We also demonstrated interaction of Wwox with Brca1, a driver of HDR, and show via immunofluorescent detection of repair proteins at ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage foci that Wwox expression suppresses DSB repair at the end-resection step of HDR. We propose a genome caretaker function for WWOX, in which Brca1-Wwox interaction supports NHEJ as the dominant DSB repair pathway in Wwox-sufficient cells. Taken together, the experimental results suggest that reduced Wwox expression, a common occurrence in cancers, dysregulates DSB repair, enhancing efficiency of likely mutagenic repair, and enabling radiation and cisplatin treatment resistance.",Excluded

Currently, laser irradiation with an infrared (830 nm) wavelength for analgesia is being used very successfully in a number of dental procedures. Study: Thus far, however, the effect of laser irradiation has been limited to analgesia. Recently Dr. Roberta Chow has reported a great deal of success by utilizing the visible red wavelength in the peripheral nerves. Preliminary results have indicated there is great analgesia being obtained, and in some cases, it hs been thought that anesthesia has been achieved. However, in dentistry, the nerves being irradiated are cranial nerves, which may react differently from peripheral nerves.

4184,Correlations of neuronal spike discharges of VL neurons during spontaneous firing and during the activity evoked by peripheral stimulation The temporal relations between simultaneously recorded neurons of the nucleus ventralis lateralis (VL) of cat thalamus were studied. The interaction and the functional connections between individual VL neurons are described. This was achieved with an application of cross correlation techniques. The response patterns of different individual neurons to somatic sensory and photic stimuli were also analyzed. For the purpose of classifying neurons as thalamocortical relay cells (T-C) and non relay cells (N-C) which do not project to the motor sensory cortex antidromic cortical stimulation was used. This stimulation was also used as conditioning one when proceeded peripheral stimuli. To analyze the nonspecific specific interactions upon single neurons conditioning photic stimuli were applied. The results show that T-C neurons are antidromically excited from a wide cortical areas and that the functional interaction between T-C neurons is mediated by a shared input from common sources. It is further postulated that N-C cells interposed between relay neurons subserve the functions of gating units modifying the neuronal network of lateral ventral nucleus of the thalamus.,Excluded
3648,"Structural basis of microtubule severing by the hereditary spastic paraplegia protein spastin Spastin, the most common locus for mutations in hereditary spastic paraplegias, and katanin are related microtubule-severing AAA ATPases involved in constructing neuronal and non-centrosomal microtubule arrays and in segregating chromosomes. The mechanism by which spastin and katanin break and destabilize microtubules is unknown, in part owing to the lack of structural information on these enzymes. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the Drosophila spastin AAA domain and provide a model for the active spastin hexamer generated using small-angle X-ray scattering combined with atomic docking. The spastin hexamer forms a ring with a prominent central pore and six radiating arms that may dock onto the microtubule. Helices unique to the microtubule-severing AAA ATPases surround the entrances to the pore on either side of the ring, and three highly conserved loops line the pore lumen. Mutagenesis reveals essential roles for these structural elements in the severing reaction. Peptide and antibody inhibition experiments further show that spastin may dismantle microtubules by recognizing specific features in the carboxy-terminal tail of tubulin. Collectively, our data support a model in which spastin pulls the C terminus of tubulin through its central pore, generating a mechanical force that destabilizes tubulin-tubulin interactions within the microtubule lattice. Our work also provides insights into the structural defects in spastin that arise from mutations identified in hereditary spastic paraplegia patients. Â©2008 Nature Publishing Group.",Excluded

[Russian] It is presented the analytical review of the effect of radiofrequency and microwave radiation on function on blood-brain barrier (BBB) in experimental animals. Analysis of referenced papers encompasses the issue of the relation of BBB changes on the power and temporal parameters, regimens of generation of acting radiation and its unevenness. Along with this the authors tried to generalize the cited works considering the marker, used in BBB studies, its molecular mass, to present the sensitivity of isolated brain structures under influence of microwaves to the permeability of several substances, their dependence on thermogeneity of acting levels as well as to draw attention to reversibility of detected changes.",Excluded

4532,"Therapeutic effect of m-[131I]- and m-[125I]iodobenzylguanidine on neuroblastoma multicellular tumor spheroids of different sizes m-[l25I]iodobenzylguanidine (m-[125I]MIBG) has been suggested as an alternative to m-[131I]MIBG for the treatment of metastatic neuroblastoma to achieve a higher radiation dose in micrometastases. To compare these two radiopharmaceuticals, a mathematical model was developed in the present study that allows for the calculation of radiation dose rates within small spherical tumors for different distributions of 131I and 125I. Furthermore, the relationship between tumor size and the therapeutic effects of m-[131I]- and m-[125I]MIBG was studied in vitro using multicellular tumor spheroids of the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH. According to the calculations, higher mean dose rates can be achieved by m-[125I]MIBG than by m-[131I]MIBG up to a tumor diameter of 100 microm when both substances are homogeneously distributed within the tumor. In larger tumors, however, mean dose rates achieved by 131I are up to 8-fold higher. Evaluation of various activity distributions demonstrated that even in tumors of less than 100 microm in diameter, marked heterogeneities of the dose rate can occur when m-[125I]MIBG is not distributed homogeneously. By treatment with m-[131I]MIBG, the growth of tumor spheroids ranging from 100 to 250 microm in diameter was inhibited more effectively in the larger than in the smaller spheroids. The growth inhibition of spheroids treated with m-[125I]MIBG was independent of the spheroid size. In consistency with the calculations, the therapeutic effect of m-[125I]- and m-[131I]MIBG was equal in spheroids with diameters of about 100 microm. In larger spheroids, m-[131I]MIBG induced a more pronounced delay in spheroid growth than m-[125I]MIBG. According to these calculations and in vitro data, m-[125I]MIBG as a single agent does not seem to be a promising alternative to m-[131I]MIBG for treatment of metastatic neuroblastoma. However, the combined use of m-[131I]- and m-[125I]MIBG may be more effective than treatment with m-[131I]MIBG alone.",Excluded
3935,"Multisensory integration in the dorsal cochlear nucleus: unit responses to acoustic and trigeminal ganglion stimulation A necessary requirement for multisensory integration is the convergence of pathways from different senses. The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) receives auditory input directly via the VIIIth nerve and somatosensory input indirectly from the Vth nerve via granule cells. Multisensory integration may occur in DCN cells that receive both trigeminal and auditory nerve input, such as the fusiform cell. We investigated trigeminal system influences on guinea pig DCN cells by stimulating the trigeminal ganglion while recording spontaneous and sound-driven activity from DCN neurons. A bipolar stimulating electrode was placed into the trigeminal ganglion of anesthetized guinea pigs using stereotaxic co-ordinates. Electrical stimuli were applied as bipolar pulses (100 micros per phase) with amplitudes ranging from 10 to 100 microA. Responses from DCN units were obtained using a 16-channel, four-shank electrode. Current pulses were presented alone or preceding 100- or 200-ms broadband noise (BBN) bursts. Thirty percent of DCN units showed either excitatory, inhibitory or excitatory-inhibitory responses to trigeminal ganglion stimulation. When paired with BBN stimulation, trigeminal stimulation suppressed or facilitated the firing rate in response to BBN in 78% of units, reflecting multisensory integration. Pulses preceding the acoustic stimuli by as much as 95 ms were able to alter responses to BBN. Bimodal suppression may play a role in attenuating body-generated sounds, such as vocalization or respiration, whereas bimodal enhancement may serve to direct attention in low signal-to-noise environments.",Excluded
4128,"Nephrotoxicity profiles and threshold dose values for [177Lu]-DOTATATE in nude mice INTRODUCTION: In peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors the main dose-limiting tissue is found in the kidneys because of tubular reabsorption and retention of radioactivity. The aim of this study was to quantify late effects in renal cortex of nude mice exposed to high amounts of [(177)Lu]-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate ([(177)Lu]-DOTATATE), and to determine whether a threshold dose value exists for these findings.METHODS: Nude mice were exposed to 90, 120 or 150 MBq of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE. Renal toxicity was evaluated up to 6 months after injection. Blood samples were collected to examine renal functional markers, and after sacrifice at 6 months changes in renal morphology were explored. Tissue damage was estimated by quantifying the relative area of the different subunits in the renal cortex using point counting. Additional morphological signs of radiation damage were also noted. The absorbed doses to the kidneys were estimated by previously determined kidney pharmacokinetics and Monte Carlo simulations for different assumptions regarding the activity distribution.RESULTS: Increased serum creatinine and urea values indicated long-term renal toxicity. The tissue area occupied by proximal tubules decreased with increasing doses of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE, whereas the other subunits in cortex slightly increased. The mean absorbed dose in the renal cortex for [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE was estimated to be 35-58 Gy for the different groups of animals. A dose-response relationship was observed for proximal tubular damage, and a threshold dose value of 24 Gy (BED 37 Gy) was determined.CONCLUSIONS: Selective morphological changes in kidney cortex of nude mice were quantified and appeared in a dose dependent manner after injection of high amounts of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE.",Included
4127,"Hematologic variables associated with brain failure in patients with small-cell lung cancer Background and purpose: We sought factors associated with the development of brain metastases after treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in patients without brain involvement at diagnosis. Method(s): We analyzed 293 patients with SCLC without brain metastases who received chemotherapy, thoracic radiation therapy (TRT), or both in 2001-2015. Pretreatment hematologic markers (platelet count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and lactate dehydrogenase) and other clinical characteristics were evaluated for correlation with brain metastases-free survival (BMFS). Cutoffs were established with receiver operating characteristics curves. Factors significant in univariate analysis were used to build a multivariate Cox model for BMFS. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 14.3 months. Brain metastases developed in 115 patients (39%)-32% of those with low pretreatment platelet counts (PPC) (<=270 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and 46% of those with high PPC (>270 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Median BMFS time for all patients was 27.9 months. Two-year BMFS rates were worse for patients with high PPC (14.6% vs. 22.1% low, P = 0.009). High PPC was independently associated with inferior BMFS (P = 0.038), as were receipt of TRT <45 Gy and no prophylactic cranial irradiation (both P < 0.001).

4320,"Intense physiological light upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor and enhances choroidal neovascularization via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha in mice OBJECTIVE: Toxicity of intense light to facilitate the development of neovascular age-related macular degeneration has been a health concern although the mechanism remains unclear.METHODS AND RESULTS: Effects of intense, but within physiological range, light on retinal pigment epithelium, a major pathogenic origin of age-related macular degeneration were studied in mice. Intense physiological light upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in retinal pigment epithelium, independent of circadian rhythm, which resulted in enhancement of choroidal neovascularization. In rd1/rd1 mice or Crx(-/-) mice that do not possess outer segment structure, light exposure did not induce VEGF, indicating that VEGF upregulation by light depended on increased outer segment phagocytosis by retinal pigment epithelium. In retinal pigment epithelium cells phagocytosing increased amount of outer segment, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) not hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha was induced, leading to VEGF upregulation. The VEGF upregulation and choroidal neovascularization enhancement were abrogated in PGC-1alpha(-/-) mice and estrogen-related receptor-alpha(-/-) mice, indicating the involvement of PGC-1alpha/estrogen-related receptor-alpha pathway.CONCLUSIONS: Intense physiological light is involved in choroidal neovascularization through excess outer segment phagocytosis and VEGF upregulation mediated by PGC-1alpha in vivo.",Excluded
3635,"Different levodopa actions on the extracellular dopamine pools in the rat striatum Levodopa has been the mainstay treatment for Parkinson's disease for several decades, but the precise mechanism for its therapeutic action is still not well understood. To date, little distinction has been made between the effects of levodopa on the different brain DA pools. We studied the levodopa action on two extracellular DA pools: one was analyzed by microdialysis (often considered as indicative of volume transmission) and the other by in vivo amperometry during nigrostriatal cell stimulation (more indicative of neurotransmission). Levodopa administration induced a moderate (increased 200%) and tardy (began at 60 min) increase in the DA-pool measured by microdialysis, an effect that increased (increased 500%) and accelerated (began at 10 min) after DA-cell degeneration. Levodopa action on the DA-pool measured by amperometry was very fast (10 min) and prominent (increased 600%) in normal rats. The DA-denervated striatum showed a fast exhaustion during cell stimulation, which prevented further study of the levodopa effect on the DA amperometry-pool under this condition. This study suggests a different kinetic for levodopa action on the volume transmitter and neurotransmitter DA-pool, showing marked changes in levodopa action in the denervated striatum.",Excluded
3797,"Impact of organ-specific dose reduction on the image quality of head and neck CT angiography OBJECTIVES: Organ-specific dose reduction (OSDR) algorithms can reduce radiation on radiosensitive organs up to 59 %. This study evaluates the influence of a new OSDR algorithm on image quality of head and neck computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in clinical routine.METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients (68 +/- 13 years) were randomised into two groups and imaged using 128-row multidetector CT. Group A (n = 31) underwent conventional CTA and group B (n = 31) CTA with a novel OSDR algorithm. Subjective and objective image quality were statistically compared. Subjective image quality was rated on a five-point scale. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated with region-of-interest measurements.RESULTS: The SNR of the common carotid artery and middle cerebral artery was 53.6 +/- 22.7 and 43.3 +/- 15.3 (group A) versus 54.1 +/- 20.5 and 46.2 +/- 14.6 (group B). The CNR was 40.0 +/- 19.3 and 29.7 +/- 12.0 (group A) compared with 40.7 +/- 16.8 and 32.9 +/- 10.9 (group B), respectively. Subjective image quality was excellent in both groups (mean score 4.4 +/- 0.7 versus 4.4 +/- 0.6). Differences between the two groups were not significant.CONCLUSIONS: The novel OSDR algorithm does not compromise image quality of head and neck CTA. Its application can be recommended for CTA in clinical routine to protect the thyroid gland and ocular lenses from unnecessary high radiation.KEY POINTS: * Organ-specific dose reduction (OSDR) can significantly reduce radiation exposure during CT * OSDR does not compromise image quality of head and neck CTA * OSDR can significantly lower the risk of radiation damage to sensitive organs * OSDR can easily be applied in routine clinical practice.",Excluded
3973,"Comparison of Neutron Organ and Effective Dose Coefficients for PIMAL Stylized Phantoms in Bent Postures in Cranial and Caudal Irradiation Geometries ABSTRACT: Radiation dose estimations in the human body are performed using computational reference phantoms, which are anatomical representations of the human body. In previous studies, dose reconstructions have been performed focusing primarily on phantoms in an upright posture, which limits the accuracy of the dose estimations for postures observed in realistic work settings. In this work, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 103 recommendations for monoenergetic neutron plane sources directed downward from above the head (cranial) and upward from below the feet (caudal) for adult female and male reference phantoms were used to calculate organ absorbed and effective dose coefficients. The Phantom with Moving Arms and Legs (PIMAL) and the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) radiation transport code were used to compute organ-absorbed dose and effective dose coefficients for the upright, half-bent (45degree), and full-bent (90degree) phantom postures. The doses calculated for each of the articulated positions were compared to those calculated for the upright posture by computing the ratios of the coefficients (45degree/upright and 90degree/upright). These ratios were used to assess the effectiveness of upright phantoms in providing a comparable estimate when conducting dose estimations and dose reconstructions for articulated positions. This work compiling neutron cranial and caudal posture-specific dose coefficients completes the series of dose coefficients computed for posture-specific ICRP Publication 116 irradiation geometries for monoenergetic photons and neutrons, in addition to cranial and caudal monoenergetic photons. Results reported demonstrated that organ-absorbed dose coefficients for most of the organs in the CRA and CAU irradiation geometries were significantly higher for the bent phantoms than for the upright phantom. Since the upright phantom underestimates the organ-absorbed dose, this demonstrates the impact of posture while performing dose calculations. Organ doses reported in past neutron dose coefficient data were found to omit effects from neutron resonances at energies of 0.435, 1.0, and 3.21 MeV from 16O in tissue. Reported data notes as high as 60% underestimation for neutron organ-absorbed doses, specifically at the neutron resonance energy region omitted by smoothing. Ongoing studies are examining the effect of resonances on reported neutron organ-absorbed dose coefficients in ICRP 116 geometries.",Excluded
4605,"A pilot study using dynamic contrast enhanced-MRI as a response biomarker of the radioprotective effect of memantine in patients receiving whole brain radiotherapy PURPOSE: This pilot prospective study sought to determine whether dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) could be used as a clinical imaging biomarker of tissue toxicity from whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT).METHOD: 14 patients who received WBRT were imaged using dynamic contrast enhanced DCE-MRI prior to and at 8-weeks, 16-weeks and 24-weeks after the initiation of WBRT. Twelve of the patients were also enrolled in the RTOG 0614 trial, which randomized patients to the use of placebo or memantine. After the unblinding of the treatments received by RTOG 0614 patients, DCE-MRI measures of tumor tissue and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) vascular permeability (Initial Area Under the Curve (AUC) Blood Adjusted) was analyzed. Cognitive, quality-of-life (QOL) assessment and blood samples were collected according to the patient's ability to tolerate the exams. Circulating endothelial cells (CEC) were measured using flow cytometry.RESULTS: Following WBRT, there was an increasing trend in the vascular permeability of tumors (p=0.09) and NAWM (p=0.06) with time. Memantine significantly (p=0.01) reduced NAWM AUC changes following radiotherapy. Patients on memantine retained (COWA p= 0.03) better cognitive functions than those on placebo. No association was observed between the level of CEC and DCE-MRI changes, time from radiotherapy or memantine use.CONCLUSIONS: DCE-MRI can detect vascular damage secondary to WBRT.

However, there have been no studies regarding the effects of radon inhalation on neuropathic pain. In this study, we aimed to determine whether radon inhalation actually induced a remission of neuropathic pain and improved the quality of life.METHODS: First, we investigated the antinociceptive effects of radon inhalation in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain. We evaluated pain behaviour in mice before and after CCI surgery, using von Frey test. Pretreated mice received CCI surgery immediately after 24-h inhalation of radon at background (BG) concentration (c. 19 Bq/m(3) ), or at a concentration of 1000 or 2000 Bq/m(3) , and post-treated mice inhaled similar levels of radon 2 days after CCI surgery.RESULTS: CCI surgery induced mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia on a plantar surface of mice, as assessed using von Frey test, and 2000 Bq/m(3) radon inhalation alleviated hyperalgesic conditions 22-37% compared to BG level concentration. Concurrently, CCI surgery increased norepinephrine (NE), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations in plasma, and leukocyte migration in paws. Furthermore, CCI-induced neuropathy reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Treatment with radon inhalation, specifically at a concentration of 2000 Bq/m(3) , produced antinociceptive effects, i.e., lowered plasma TNF-alpha, NE and NO levels and restored SOD activity, as well as pain-related behaviour.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that inhalation of 2000 Bq/m(3) radon prevented and alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain in mice.",Excluded

Reduction of mice adult hippocampal neurogenesis was induced by cranial irradiation. LW-AFC was administered by oral gavage for 30 d after cranial irradiation treatment. Immunofluorescence and Nissl's staining were performed for histological morphology assessment. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining was used in the detection of proliferation cells. The peripheral blood and hippocampal homogenate were collected to measure the content of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (INF-y), interleukin-1 (3 (IL-1(3), IL-4 and IL-10. The hippocampal homogenate was used for Western blot to detect the BDNFkappaB signal pathway, including extracellular regulated protein kinases1/2 (ERK1/2) and BDNF target protein. Morris water maze and new object recognition test were performed to examine the cognitive function of mice. The mice forced swimming and tail suspension test were used to assess alteration in depressive behavior. Long term potentiation was used to examine the synaptic plasticity change of mice. RESULTS Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly reduced after irradiation of 20 Gray dose (10 Gray per day, total 2 d). LW-AFC treatment increased the BrdU number of irradiated mice (P<0.05). In Morris water maze test, LW-AFC group showed decreased escape latency in the learning period (P<0.05), while increased the number of crossing the platform in the memory period. LW-AFC can also reduce the immobility time of mice in the tail suspension test (P<0.01).

4549,"Pituitary metastasis from renal cell carcinoma: Description of a case report Objective: Rare disease Background: Pituitary metastasis is uncommon, breast and lung cancers being the most frequent primary tumors. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a rare cause of pituitary metastases, with only a few cases described to date. Case Report: We report a case of a 61-year-old man who presented with a progressive deterioration of visual acuity and field associated with a bitemporal hemianopsia. Two years ago, he underwent radical right nephrectomy for a clear cell RCC (ccRCC). The biological tests showed pan-hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus. Brain MRI revealed a large sellar tumor lesion bilaterally infiltrating the cavernous sinuses, which was surgically resected. Histology confirmed a ccRCC pituitary metastasis. The patient received post-surgical radiotherapy. Considering the presence of concomitant extra-pituitary metastases, treatment with sunitinib was started, followed by several lines of therapy with axitinib, everolimus, and sorafenib because of tumor progression. The patient also presented with a pituitary tumor recurrence, which was treated by stereotaxic radiotherapy. He died five years after the initial diagnosis of RCC and 30 months after the diagnosis of the pituitary metastasis. Conclusion(s): There are no standardized treatment guidelines for management of pituitary metastases. Pituitary surgery plays a role in symptom palliation, and it does not have any relevant impact on survival. Exclusive radiotherapy or stereotaxic radiotherapy could be an alternative to surgery in patients whose general condition is poor or who have concomitant extra-pituitary metastases.

4046,"Gamma Knife surgery for patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas: Predictors of tumor control, neurological deficits, and hypopituitarism - Clinical article Object. Nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas often recur after microsurgery and thereby require further treatment. Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) has been used to treat recurrent adenomas. In this study, the authors evaluated outcomes following GKS of nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas and assessed predictors of tumor control, neurological deficits, and delayed hypopituitarism. Methods. Between June 1989 and March 2010, 140 consecutive patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas were treated using GKS at the University of Virginia. The median patient age was 51 years (range 21-82 years), and 56% of patients were male. Mean tumor volume was 5.6 cm3 (range 0.6-35 cm3). Thirteen patients were treated with GKS as primary therapy, and 127 had undergone at least 1 open resection prior to GKS. Ninety-three patients had a history of hormone therapy prior to GKS. The mean maximal dose of GKS was 38.6 Gy (range 10-70 Gy), the mean marginal dose was 18 Gy (range 5-25 Gy), and the mean number of isocenters was 9.8 (range 1-26). Follow-up evaluations were performed in all 140 patients, ranging from 0.5 to 17 years (mean 5 years, median 4.2 years). Results. Tumor volume remained stable or decreased in 113 (90%) of 125 patients with available follow-up imaging. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated radiographic progression free survival at 2, 5, 8, and 10 years to be 98%, 97%, 91%, and 87%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, a tumor volume greater than 5 cm3 (hazard ratio = 5.0, 95% CI 1.5-17.2; p = 0.023) was the only factor predictive of tumor growth. The median time to tumor progression was 14.5 years. Delayed hypopituitarism occurred in 30.3% of patients. No factor was predictive of post-GKS hypopituitarism. A new or worsening cranial nerve deficit occurred in 16 (13.7%) of 117 patients. Visual decline was the most common neurological deficit (12.8%), and all patients experiencing visual decline had evidence of tumor progression. In multivariate analysis, a tumor volume greater than 5 cm3 (OR = 3.7, 95% CI 1.2-11.7; p = 0.025) and pre-GKS hypopituitarism (OR = 7.5, 95% CI 1.1-60.8; p = 0.05) were predictive of a new or worsened neurological deficit. Conclusions. In patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas, GKS confers a high rate of tumor control and a low rate of neurological deficits. The most common complication following GKS is delayed hypopituitarism, and this occurs in a minority of patients.",Excluded

The rats were then followed and killed at various times afterward. Serotonin (5-HT) and its major metabolite 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) were assayed as well as prostaglandin synthesis. Microvessel permeability was assessed by quantitative evaluation of Evans blue dye extravasation.RESULTS: None of the rats developed neurologic dysfunction, and histologic examination revealed only occasional gliosis in the ventral white matter at 240 days after irradiation. Serotonin levels were unchanged at 2, 14, and 56 days after radiation but increased at 120 and 240 days in the irradiated cord segments when compared to both the nonirradiated thoracic and cervical segments (p < 0.01) and age-matched controls (p < 0.03). The calculated utilization ratio of serotonin (5-HIAA/5-HT) remained unchanged. Immediately after radiation (at 3 and 24 h) an abrupt but brief increase in the synthesis of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), thromboxane (TXB2), and prostacyclin [6 keto-PGF1 alpha (6KPGF)] was noted, which returned to normal at 3 days. This was followed after 7 and 14 days by a significant fall off in synthesis of all three prostaglandins. Thereafter, at 28, 56, 120, and 240 days, escalated production of thromboxane followed, while prostacyclin synthesis remained markedly reduced (-88% of control level at 240 days). Up to 7 days after radiation the calculated TXB2/6KPGF ratio remained balanced, regardless of the observed abrupt early fluctuations in their rate of synthesis. Later, between 7 and 240 days after radiation, a significant imbalance was present which became more pronounced over time. In the first 24 h after radiation, a 104% increase in microvessel permeability was observed which returned to normal by 3 days. Normal permeability was maintained at 14 and 28 days, but at 120 and 240 days a persistent and significant increase of 98% and 73% respectively above control level was noted.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation induces severe impairment in microvessel function even in the histologically unaffected spinal cord, and alters the secretory phenotype of various cell systems in the central nervous system.",Included
4471,"Low-dose total-body carbon-ion irradiations induce early transcriptional alteration without late Alzheimer's disease-like pathogenesis and memory impairment in mice The cause and risk factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are largely unknown. Studies on possible radiation-induced AD-like pathogenesis and behavioral consequences are important because humans are exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) from various sources. It was reported that total-body irradiations (TBI) at 10 cGy of low linear energy transfer (LET) X-rays to mice triggered acute transcriptional alterations in genes associated with cognitive dysfunctions. However, it was unknown whether low doses of IR could induce AD-like changes late after exposure. We reported previously that 10 cGy X-rays induced early transcriptional response of several AD-related genes in hippocampi without late AD-like pathogenesis and memory impairment in mice. Here, further studies on two low doses (5 or 10 cGy) of high LET carbonion irradiations are reported. On expression of 84 AD-related genes in hippocampi, at 4 hr after TBI, 5 cGy induced a significant upregulation of three genes (Abca1, Casp3, and Chat) and 10 cGy led to a marked upregulation of one gene (Chat) and a downregulation of three genes (Apoe, Ctsd, and Il1alpha), and, at 1 year after TBI, one gene (Il1alpha) was significantly downregulated in 10 cGy-irradiated animals. Changes in spatial learning ability and memory and induction of AD-like pathogenesis were not detected by in vivo brain imaging for amyloid-beta peptide accumulation and by immunohistochemical staining of amyloid precursor protein, amyloid-beta protein, tau, and phosphorylated tau protein. These findings indicate that low doses of carbon-ion irradiations did not cause behavioral impairment or AD-like pathological change in mice.",Included
4284,"Laser evoked potentials for assessing sensory neuropathy in human patients Sensory neuropathy usually impairs tactile sensations related to large myelinated afferents (Abeta) as well as thermal-pain sense related to small myelinated (Adelta) and unmyelinated (C) afferents. By selectively affecting large or small fibres, some sensory neuropathies may also provoke a dissociated sensory loss. Standard nerve conduction studies and somatosensory evoked potentials assess Abeta-fibre function only. Laser pulses selectively excite free nerve endings in the superficial skin layers and evoke Adelta-related brain potentials (LEPs). From earlier studies and new cases we collected data on 270 patients with sensory neuropathy. LEPs often disclosed subclinical dysfunction of Adelta fibres and proved a sensitive and reliable diagnostic tool for assessing small-fibre function in sensory neuropathy. [References: 24]",Excluded
3955,"Elucidating the mechanisms and loci of neuronal excitation by transcranial magnetic stimulation using a finite element model of a cortical sulcus OBJECTIVE: This work aims to elucidate by what physical mechanisms and where stimulation occurs in the brain during transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), taking into account cortical geometry and tissue heterogeneity.METHODS: An idealized computer model of TMS was developed, comprising a stimulation coil, a cortical sulcus, and surrounding tissues. The distribution of the induced electric field was computed, and estimates of the relevant parameters were generated to predict the locus and type of neurons stimulated during TMS, assuming three different stimulation mechanisms.RESULTS: Tissue heterogeneity strongly affects the spatial distribution of the induced electric field and hence which stimulation mechanism is dominant and where it acts. Stimulation of neurons may occur in the gyrus, in the lip of the gyrus, and in the walls of the sulcus. The stimulated cells can be either pyramidal cells having medium to large caliber axons, or intracortical fibers of medium caliber.CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the influence of cortical folding on the action of magnetic and electric fields on cortical tissue.SIGNIFICANCE: Tissue geometry and heterogeneity in electrical conductivity both must be taken into account to predict accurately stimulation loci and mechanism in TMS.",Excluded

3623,"Treating the contents and not the container: Dosimetric study of hair-sparing whole brain intensity modulated radiation therapy Hematogenous metastatases are the most common adult central nervous system malignancies. The standard treatment of these patients continues to include whole brain radiation. An unavoidable toxicity of this treatment is acute iatrogenic alopecia. This alopecia is a significant cause of patient distress. Our purpose was to quantify the sparing of the hair bearing skin that could be achieved by using a complex hair-sparing approach. To achieve this goal, we treat an anthropomorphic phantom with both conventional and inverse-planned intensity-modulated portals. The skin dose was evaluated through dose-volume histograms and thermo-luminescent dosimetry. The median calculated dose was reduced by 38%. The average measured dose at five surface points was reduced by 53% - from 95% of the prescription dose with the conventional plan, to 44%, with the IMRT plan. This sparing was achieved while maintaining adequate target coverage. Because of the low radiation tolerance of the hair follicle, this dose reduction is not expected, on its own, to eliminate radiation alopecia but bears promise in combination with other toxicity-sparing strategies.

Recent studies expand the expression of disease involving the choroid, retina, optic nerve and heart. Method(s): Clinical Case: Female, 63-year-old, with hypertension and dyslipidemia, both medicated, otherwise healthy. She had four close family members with history of vascular events, including stroke or myocardial infarction, before the age of 50. She noticed vision problems in her left eye of acute onset. Her visual acuities were 10/10 OD and 1/10 OS with a left relative afferent pupillary defect. Bilateral funduscopic examination showed: narrowing and arteriolar sheathing, arteriovenous nipping, discrete perifoveal pigment changes, left optic disc atrophy. Without other neurological abnormalities. Humphrey perimetry: paracentral scotoma in OD; inferior cecocentral and upper arcuate scotomas in OS. Brain MRI: important periventricular and subcortical ischemic leukoencephalopathy, and multiple ischemic vascular lacunae. Additionally, several enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces were located mostly at external capsules and anterior temporo-polar regions. Result(s): The molecular study detected the mutation c.1672C>T(p.Arg558Cys) in heterozygosity in NOTCH3 gene. (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): CADASIL diagnosis was suspected taking into account family history and atypical imaging findings. Cerebral and retinal vessels share anatomical and physiological properties. The abnormalities of retina and optic nerve may be due to direct microvascular damage or due to trans-synaptic retrograde degeneration after injuries involving optic radiation.

The cells have been stimulated in vitro with different number of pulses (75 - 1250), different intensities (10, 20 and 40%) and different frequencies (0.25, 1 and 10 Hz) by using a double coil (2x70 mm) connected to the 'Magstim rapid'. At selected time points after treatment the following endpoints have been determined: viability, cyclic AMP (cAMP) and heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72) (HL-60 cells), and viability, cAMP, dopamine and noradrenaline (PC12 cells). Viability was measured with the alamarBlue assay, whereas cAMP, Hsp72, dopamine and noradrenaline were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).RESULTS: In both cell lines viability was not influenced by rTMS treatment, the same was true for the cytosolic cAMP concentration. In HL-60 cells rTMS treatment did not change the Hsp72 content, also a protective effect of rTMS treatment on cell viability before toxic H(2)O(2) treatment was not observed. After high potassium treatment the release of the two neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline in PC12 cells was enhanced 15- and 5-fold, respectively, but after rTMS treatment no change in the release of the two neurotransmitters was observed.CONCLUSIONS: In two mammalian cell lines rTMS treatment in a variety of exposure conditions does not influence any of the measured parameters.",Excluded
3787,"Radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases based on a fast, three-dimensional MR imaging technique A fast, three-dimensional (3D) sequence for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain and its application in radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases is reported. The measuring sequence (MPRAGE) requires magnetization-prepared 180degree inversion pulses followed by rapid low angle excitation pulses and gradient-echoes for image generation. The resulting T<inf>1</inf>-weighted MPRAGE images were compared with two-dimensional (2D) T<inf>1</inf>- weighted spin-echo (SE) images after administration of 0.1 mmol/kg b.w. Gd- DTPA in 10 patients with known brain metastases. Original or multiplanar reformatted images obtained from a 128 partition data set of the 3D MPRAGE sequence offered comparable diagnostic quality to that of 2D SE imaging. Gd- DTPA enhancement and lesion targeting was similar in most of the patients in SE as well as MPRAGE imaging. During imaging and therapy the patient's head was fixed in a stereotactic localization system which is usable at the MR and the linear accelerator installations. The dose calculation of the radiosurgery planning was based on 3D MR imaging data assuming a homogenous attenuation value inside the head which was sufficient for an accurate dose calculation since tissue inhomogeneities do not significantly influence the shape of the relative dose distribution especially for radiosurgery of the brain. Under this circumstance the dose calculation can be based only on the 3D geometric conformation of the patient's head. A simple algorithm for treatment planning can be used if the MR data are free of geometric distortion. Target point definition, external head contour, and critical structures could be precisely defined in 3D MPRAGE images offering important advantages (i.e., improved spatial resolution, reformatted image reconstruction, rapid 3D imaging and short examination time under mask fixation resulting in better patient comfort, better slice profile, reduced vascular pulsation artefacts, superior and variable choice of soft tissue contrast due to centric phase-encoding order, lower specific absorption rate) over conventional 2D SE imaging. In addition, target volume, calculated dose distribution, and critical structures can be displayed as 3D shaded structures for better assessment for matching of target volume and dose distribution. These findings, along with other advantages of 3D imaging, indicate that the MPRAGE sequence may provide an alternative to T<inf>1</inf>-weighted 2D SE imaging in the radiosurgical treatment planning of brain metastases.",Excluded
4143,"Unilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation has a measurable ipsilateral effect on rigidity and bradykinesia in Parkinson disease BACKGROUND: Bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) improves motor function in Parkinson disease (PD). However, little is known about the quantitative effects on motor behavior of unilateral STN DBS.METHODS: In 52 PD subjects with STN DBS, we quantified in a double-blinded manner rigidity (n=42), bradykinesia (n=38), and gait speed (n=45). Subjects were tested in four DBS conditions: both on, left on, right on and both off. A force transducer was used to measure rigidity across the elbow, and gyroscopes were used to measure angular velocity of hand rotations for bradykinesia. About half of the subjects were rated using the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (part III) motor scores for arm rigidity and repetitive hand rotation simultaneously during the kinematic measurements. Subjects were timed walking 25 feet.RESULTS: All subjects had significant improvement with bilateral STN DBS. Contralateral, ipsilateral and bilateral stimulation significantly reduced rigidity and bradykinesia. Bilateral stimulation improved rigidity more than unilateral stimulation of either side, but there was no significant difference between ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation. Although bilateral stimulation also increased hand rotation velocity more than unilateral stimulation of either side, contralateral stimulation increased hand rotation significantly more than ipsilateral stimulation. All stimulation conditions improved walking time but bilateral stimulation provided the greatest improvement.CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral STN DBS decreased rigidity and bradykinesia contralaterally as well ipsilaterally. As expected, bilateral DBS improved gait more than unilateral DBS.",Excluded

[Japanese] Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients with small cell lung cancer has been performed in many countries. While a consensus that PCI decreased the rate of tumor recurrence in the brain has been obtained, the survival advantage of PCI remains controversial. To improve results of PCI, a retrospective study was carried out. Twenty-five patients and 16 patients underwent PCI with doses of 24 Gy (accelerated hyperfractionation) and 30 Gy. Overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 60% and 26% for the patients with a dose of 24 Gy, and 33% and 20% for those with a dose of 30 Gy, respectively. Brain metastasis as the first relapse site was 16% and 13% for the patients with doses of 24 Gy and 30 Gy, and brain metastasis as the only relapse site was 12% and 6%, respectively. As prognostic factors, there were significant differences between patients with less than 65 years of age and 65 or more, and between patients with stage IIIa and stage IIIB. A prospective randomized study with more strict patient selection (stage III A disease) and appropriate dose (27-30Gy) for PCI may prove that PCI provides significant survival benefit.",Excluded
4622,"Dosimetric analysis of the brachial plexus among patients with breast cancer treated with post-mastectomy radiotherapy to the ipsilateral supraclavicular area: report of 3 cases of radiation-induced brachial plexus neuropathy BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the brachial plexus (BP) dose of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) to the ipsilateral supraclavicular (ISCL) area, and report the characteristics of radiation-induced brachial plexus neuropathy (RIBPN).METHODS: The BP dose of 31 patients who received adjuvant PMRT to the ISCL area and chest wall using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and the records of 3 patients with RIBPN were retrospectively analyzed based on the standardized Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-endorsed guidelines. The total dose to the ISCL area and chest wall was 50 Gy in 25 fractions.RESULTS: Patients with a higher number of removed lymph nodes (RLNs) had a higher risk of RIBPN (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.189, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.005-1.406, p = 0.044). In 31 patients treated with 3DCRT, the mean dose to the BP without irradiation to the ISCL area was significantly less than that with irradiation to the ISCL area (0.97 +/- 0.20 vs. 44.39 +/- 4.13 Gy, t = 136.75, p <0.001). In the 3DCRT plans with irradiation to the ISCL area and chest wall, the maximum dose to the BP was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.40, p = 0.026), body mass index (BMI) (r = -0.44, p = 0.014), and body weight (r = -0.45, p = 0.011). Symptoms of the 3 patients with RIBPN occurred 37-65 months after radiotherapy, and included progressive upper extremity numbness, pain, and motor disturbance. After treatment, 1 patient was stable, and the other 2 patients' symptoms worsened.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of RIBPN was higher in patients with a higher number of RLNs after PMRT. The dose to the BP is primarily from irradiation of the ISCL area, and is higher in slim and young patients. Prevention should be the main focus of managing RIBPN, and the BP should be considered an organ-at-risk when designing a radiotherapy plan for the ISCL area.",Excluded
4444,"Effects of weak microwave fields amplitude modulated at ELF on EEG of symmetric brain areas in rats Averaged electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency spectra were studied in eight unanesthetized and unmyorelaxed adult male rats with chronically implanted carbon electrodes in symmetrical somesthetic areas when a weak (0.1-0.2 mW/cm) microwave (MW, 945 MHz) field, amplitude-modulated at extremely low frequency (ELF) (4 Hz), was applied. Intermittent (1 min ""On,"" 1 min ""Off"") field exposure (10-min duration) was used. Hemispheric asymmetry in frequency spectra (averaged data for 10 or 1 min) of an ongoing EEG was characterized by a power decrease in the 1.5-3 Hz range on the left hemisphere and by a power decrease in the 10-14 and 20-30 Hz ranges on the right hemisphere. No differences between control and exposure experiments were shown under these routines of data averaging. Significant elevations of EEG asymmetry in 10-14 Hz range were observed during the first 20 s after four from five onsets of the MW field, when averaged spectra were obtained for every 10 s. Under neither control nor pre- and postexposure conditions was this effect observed. These results are discussed with respect to interaction of MW fields with the EEG generators.",Excluded

Materials/Methods: We queried our institutional IRB-approved SBRT registry for the period 2004-2014 for any early stage SCLC patients with a minimum of 6 months follow up. All patients had biopsy proven disease and were deemed medically inoperable after tumor board review. Routine staging consisted of PET/CT and MRI brain scans only. The treatment model consisted of SBRT to the primary followed by adjuvant platinum based chemotherapy (CHT) and then prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). SBRT was delivered employing a stereotactic-specific LINAC with vacuum-bag based immobilization, abdominal compression, and infrared based X-ray positioning system+/- CBCT for image-guidance. Result(s): Of 747 definitively treated cancers over 10 years, 16 (2%) were SCLCs meeting study criteria. Patient characteristics revealed: median KPS was 80 (range 50-90), median age was 69 years (range 45-87), 50% of patients were female, median BMI was 28.2 (range 17.4-41.2). Tumor characteristics revealed: median tumor size was 3.25cm (range1.4-7.2), 4 (25%) tumors were ""central"" (per RTOG 0813 criteria), median PET-SUV<inf>max</inf> was 10.3 (range 2.8-21.1). Median time to SBRT from diagnosis was 2.1 months (range 0.6-6.7). SBRT schedules were: 60 Gy/3 fractions in 25%, 50 Gy/5 fractions in 68.75%, and 30 Gy/1 fractions in 6.25% of cases. Mean follow up was 15 months. Fifteen (94%) received at least 2 cycles CHT, 2 (12.5%) received CHT before SBRT. Nine patients (56%) received PCI and of the 7 (44%) that did not, 1 developed brain metastases prior, 1 refused, and 5 died of non-cancer issues before PCI . There was no grade 3 or higher toxicity; rate of grade 2 or less toxicity was 12.5%. Seven patients (43.75%) were alive at analysis and of the 9 deaths, 2 (22%) were cancer, 5 were non-cancer (56%), 2 unknown cause (22%). Local control was 100% with 13 patients (81.25%) without any failure. Crude rates of failure were one (6.25%) distant and regional nodal and two (12.5%) distant. Median survival was 39 months. Three-year actuarial overall and progression-free survivals were 50.5% and 76%, respectively. Conclusion(s): SBRT for stage I medically inoperable SCLC yields excellent local control. The minimal regional nodal failure lends support to PET for mediastinal staging. The primary failure pattern is distant.",Excluded
3736,"Annual rate of hearing loss falls after fractionated stereotactic irradiation for vestibular schwannoma PURPOSE: The rate of hearing loss in a population before and after irradiation was investigated to determine the effect of irradiation on hearing impairment.METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 72 patients with vestibular schwannoma who received fractionated stereotactic irradiation from 1992 to 1999, 21 had had their hearing levels examined 3 months or more before the treatment. The mean time between the initial examination and treatment was 18.6 months (range: 3-89 months), and the mean time between treatment and the last follow-up was 24.2 months (12-69 months). Thirty-six to 50 Gy in 20-25 fractions over 5 to 6 weeks was given using an X-ray beam from a linear accelerator. Pure tone average (PTA) was measured using the mean hearing level at five frequencies, and the annual rate of hearing loss was defined as [(hearing loss in PTA(dB))/(follow-up period (months)x12)].RESULTS: The actual cumulative curve of decrease in tumor size of 2 mm or more was 38.3% at 2 years and 80.0% at 3 years. The mean of hearing loss in PTA was 11.6+/-10.3 dB (-1 to 35 dB) from the initial examination to the start of irradiation and 11.9+/-14.4 dB (-14 to 37 dB) from the start of irradiation to the last follow-up. The mean annual rates of hearing loss before irradiation and in the 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th years after irradiation were, respectively, 18.6, 11.2, 6.2, 5.1, and 5.0 dB/year. The annual rates of hearing loss in the 2nd year (P=0.025) and 3rd year (P=0.018) were significantly slower than the rate before irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: The mean annual rate of hearing loss was higher before irradiation than after irradiation, and hearing loss slowed rather than accelerated after irradiation. Although hearing loss after the treatment was usually permanent, fractionated stereotactic irradiation was suggested to be effective to lower the rate of hearing loss.",Excluded

Their in vitro proliferation rates and the class I expression of major histocompatibility complex were not different from those of wild-type cells. Five-Gy irradiation of the respective cytokine producers slightly reduced the in vitro cell growth but treatment with 15 Gy significantly impaired the proliferation. In contrast, the secretion of both cytokines from the respective transduced cells was retained compared with the cell growth. We immunized syngeneic mice with irradiated wild-type cells as a control or cytokine-producing cells and challenged the mice with unirradiated wild-type cells. The control mice developed tumors of the challenged wild-type cells, on the contrary, the mice which had received irradiated IL-2 or GM-CSF producers did not. Thus, IL-2- or GM-CSF-expressing syngeneic tumor cells can be potentially used as a tumor vaccine by inducing protective immunity against low immunogenic neuroblastomas in the inoculated hosts.",Excluded
4352,"Effect of alkali on the size dispersity of mammalian DNA measured by filter elution DNA from unirradiated and irradiated cultured 9L rat brain tumor cells was held for varying times in low ionic strength solutions at pH 11.0, 12.3, or 12.9. The effect of this exposure to alkali on the DNA size distribution was determined by comparing the DNA filter elution profiles obtained experimentally with those theoretically predicted for monodispersed and random distributions. At pH 12.3 or 12.9, DNA from cells irradiated with 300 rad eluted with first-order kinetics corresponding to a random DNA size distribution. The median size of the distribution decreased if the irradiated DNA was exposed to pH 12.3 for 24 h. At pH 12.3 or 12.9, DNA from unirradiated cells eluted initially with complex kinetics that later became linear (18-21 h for pH 12.3 or 13-15 h for pH 12.9), characteristic of a monodispersed DNA size distribution. Holding either unirradiated or irradiated DNA at pH 11.0, below the critical unwinding pH, produced no effect on the elution profiles. Analysis of these filter elution data indicated that after sufficient exposure to pH 12.3 or 12.9, undamaged DNA molecules from mammalian cells elute as a single-stranded monodispersed size distribution of approximately 1 X 10(10) daltons. While the possibility cannot be completely eliminated that this monodispersed size represents an upper limit determined by physical forces, these results, in conjunction with those obtained using other techniques, lend credence to the existence of a nonrandom higher-order structure in mammalian chromosomal DNA.",Excluded
4626,"NF-kappaB activation in light-induced retinal degeneration in a mouse model PURPOSE: To investigate the modulation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in light-induced photoreceptor degeneration in a mouse model.METHODS: Mice were exposed to intense green light. Light-induced activation of NF-kappaB and its nuclear localization were studied by immunohistochemistry. The NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in the retinas after exposure to light was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Nuclear transactivation of NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor cells was determined by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. The amount of NF-kappaB p65 in the photoreceptor cells after exposure to light was assessed by Western blot analysis. To obtain more photoreceptor-specific information, microdissected photoreceptor cells were used in some studies.RESULTS: By an immunohistochemical method, the perinuclear region of the photoreceptor cells was heavily labeled with an antibody to activated NF-kappaB after a 1-hour exposure to light. Nuclear localization of NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor nucleus was seen at 12 hours. In the experiments involving 3 hours of exposure to light followed by recovery in the dark, nuclear localization of NF-kappaB was also noted after 12 hours' recovery in the dark. During continuous exposure to light, the NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity gradually increased and reached its maximum at 12 hours. There was an increase of NF-kappaB p65 protein at 3 hours. The mRNA levels of IkappaBalpha were upregulated after 6 hours' exposure to light.CONCLUSIONS: Intense light activated NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor cells in vivo, increased the NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity, and increased the expression of mRNA of IkappaBalpha, a target gene of NF-kappaB.",Excluded

3861,"Resveratrol restores erectile function in irradiated rats: Role on SIRT-1 and nNOS protein expressions INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of resveratrol (RVT), a well-known antioxidant agent, on oxidative parameters and erectile function in a rat model of pelvic irradiation. MATERIAL & METHODS: Fifty Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups; control (C), radiation-early period (1 week) (Rd-E), radiation-late period (10 weeks) (Rd-L), Rd-E and resveratrol (Rd-E-RVT) and Rd-L and resveratrol treatment (Rd-L-RVT). Irradiation was performed based on the localized prostate cancer treatment protocol as a total of 20Gy. Resveratrol was given 10mg/kg orally 1 week for Rd-E-RVT group and 10 weeks for Rd-L-RVT. At the end of the experiment, intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements were performed and rats were sacrificed for tissue collection. RESULT(S): Malondealdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and caspase-3 activities were increased in both early and late irradiation groups as the latter being more elevated. Resveratrol treatment reversed these parameters back to control levels in both Rd- E-RVT and Rd-L-RVT groups. Glutathione (GSH) levels were decreased in Rd-E and Rd-L groups and were reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment in both early and late periods. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activities, cyclic GMP (c-GMP) and nitric oxide (NO) levels were decreased in the early period of irradiation however this difference doesn't have statistical significance. These parameters were decreased significantly in Rd-L group and resveratrol treatment reversed these values back to control levels. Sirtuin-1 protein expression was similar in both Rd-E and Rd-E-RVT groups however the protein expression was decreased in the late radiation period which is reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment. Intracavernosal pressure measurements were performed only in the late period as erectile dysfunction is a late complication of irradiation. The ICP/MAP ratio was significantly decreased in Rd-L group and was significantly reversed back to control levels with RvT treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Resveratrol, due to its strong anti-oxidant effects, may be a potential candidate for the management of oxidative stress induced erectile dysfunction in patients undergoing pelvic irradiation, if supported with further clinical studies.

We have used suction-electrode recording to examine the responses of rods after conditionally knocking down the insulin receptor. Our results show that these IR knock-down rods have an accelerated decay of the light response and a small decrease in sensitivity by comparison to littermate WT rods. Our results indicate that the insulin receptor may have some role in controlling the rate of rod response decay, but they exclude a major role of the insulin receptor pathway in phototransduction.",Excluded
4351,"Clinical impact of re-irradiation with carbon ion radiotherapy for locally recurrent rectal cancer Purpose or Objective: The re-irradiation of locally recurrent rectal cancer presents challenges due to the proximity of critical organs such as bowel. Ion beam therapy, specifically carbon ions radiotherapy (CIRT) have some advantages for the favorable relative biological effectiveness and physical dose distribution providing a highly conformal dose distribution while minimizing normal tissue damage. The aim of this study is to report our experience on feasibility and toxicity of carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in previously irradiated patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Between August 2014 and February 2017, a total of 10 patients (M:F= 8:2) were treated with CIRT as re-irradiation for locally recurrent rectal cancer at National Centre of Oncological Hadrontherapy (CNAO). Patient ages ranged between 46 to 78 years (median 58.5 years). All patients had a history of surgery and pelvic radiotherapy. Specifically, the dose of previous radiotherapy ranged from 45 to 50.4 Gy in 9 patients one of which received a brachytherapy boost up to a total dose of 20Gy. One patient was irradiated with a total dose of 76 Gy for a prostatic cancer. One patient, at time of the first recurrence, underwent to re-irradiation with stereotactic radiotherapy (30 Gy in 6 fractions). They had 7 presacral, 1 perineal, 1 perianal and 1 pre-coccygeal relapses. Three patients received spacer implantation prior to CIRT to secure adequate distance between bowel and tumor. Toxicity was scored according CTCAE 4.0 scale. Results The median interval between the two courses of radiotherapy was 89.3 months (range: 13.8 - 138.2). Median total dose of CIRT was 60 GyRBE (range: 35-76.8) and was administered in a median number of 16 fractions (range: 15-20) over 4 weeks (from 3 to 4.8 Gy RBE/fraction). The GTV ranged from 7.21 to 300.8 cm<sup>3</sup> with a median of 28.42 cm<sup>3</sup>. The PTV ranged from 53.55 to 742.64 cm<sup>3</sup>. All patients completed the scheduled treatment course. Median follow-up was 13 months. Acute toxicity was mild and mainly neuropathic: grade 2 (G2) neuropathic pain in 1 (10%) and G1 in 2 (20%) patients. The major late toxicities were peripheral neuropathy (20%, G2). No G>=3 acute/late reaction nor pelvic infections were observed. Four patients were diagnosed with local progression after carbon ion radiotherapy with a median disease free survival of 11.4 months (range: 2.4- 39.7). Three patients experienced systemic progression. The estimated 1-year-local control rate was 80%. Conclusion(s): In our experience, CIRT for locally recurrent rectal cancer appears to be safe and effective with an acceptable rate of morbidity of normal tissue. More data and longer follow-up are required to investigate the long-term disease control and to determine late effects. Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded
3918,"Direct regulation of CREB transcriptional activity by ATM in response to genotoxic stress Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a syndrome of cancer susceptibility, immune dysfunction, and neurodegeneration that is caused by mutations in the A-T-mutated (ATM) gene. ATM has been implicated as a critical regulator of cellular responses to DNA damage, including the activation of cell cycle checkpoints and induction of apoptosis. Although defective cell cycle-checkpoint regulation and associated genomic instability presumably contribute to cancer susceptibility in A-T, the mechanism of neurodegeneration in A-T is not well understood. In addition, although ATM is required for the induction of the p53 transcriptional program in response to DNA damage, the identities of the relevant transcription factors that mediate ATM-dependent changes in gene expression remain largely undetermined. In this article, we describe a signal transduction pathway linking ATM directly to the Ca(2+)/cAMP response element-binding protein, CREB, a transcription factor that regulates cell growth, homeostasis, and survival. ATM phosphorylated CREB in vitro and in vivo in response to ionizing radiation (IR) and H(2)O(2) on a stress-inducible domain. IR-induced phosphorylation of CREB correlated with a decrease in CREB transactivation potential and reduced interaction between CREB and its transcriptional coactivator, CREB-binding protein (CBP). A CREB mutant containing Ala substitutions at ATM phosphorylation sites displayed enhanced transactivation potential, resistance to inhibition by IR, and increased binding to CBP. We propose that ATM-mediated phosphorylation of CREB in response to DNA damage modulates CREB-dependent gene expression and that dysregulation of the ATM-CREB pathway may contribute to neurodegeneration in A-T.",Excluded

We report the case of a 46-year-old woman with a history of more than three years of experiential auditory hallucinations caused by chronic epileptic discharges, which developed after radiotherapy for an oligoastrocytoma in the left temporal lobe. Electroencephalography revealed frequent spikes in the left temporal lobe. In response to clonazepam, but not antipsychotics, her auditory hallucinations almost completely disappeared and spikes were reduced. Her auditory hallucinations exhibited the characteristics of first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia, however, the content of experiential auditory hallucinations endured by our patient suggested an epileptic origin. We believe that the persistent subictal discharges, in combination with hyperexcitability of the temporal neocortex near radiation-induced necrotic lesions, were the cause of the auditory hallucinations.",Excluded

The different skin reactions are described in detail because of their importance and frequency. Thus the acute skin lesions after high doses and the late effects resulting, either from high doses, or from accumulation of chronic irradiation, are studied. The main early syndromes are then characterized: neurological, gastro-intestinal, bone-marrow and prodromic. As far as the complex problem of radiocarcinogenesis is concerned, the main results derived from studies by international organizations such as the ICRP and the UNSCEAR are reported: risk coefficient of 5% per gray, for lethal radio-induced cancer, after total body irradiation, at low dose of low-LET radiation. The effects of irradiation in utero are then considered: risk of malformation after irradiation during the two first months of pregnancy and risk of mental retardation after irradiation during the third and the fourth months. Finally, the genetic risk is presented as being equal to one fourth of the risk of carcinogenesis at low-doses. The effects of irradiation on the gonads are also described.

4051,"Therapeutic resistance in breast cancer cells can result from deregulated EGFR signaling The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) interacts with various downstream molecules including phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC), Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/Akt/GSK-3, Jak/STAT and others. Often these pathways are deregulated in human malignancies such as breast cancer. Various therapeutic approaches to inhibit the activity of EGFR family members including small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) have been developed. A common problem with cancer treatments is the development of drug-resistance. We examined the effects of a conditionally-activated EGFR (v-Erb-B:ER) on the resistance of breast cancer cells to commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, paclitaxel, cisplatin and 5-flurouracil as well as ionizing radiation (IR). v-Erb-B is similar to the EGFR-variant EGFRvIII, which is expressed in various cancers including breast, brain, prostate. Both v-Erb-B and EGFRvIII encode the EGFR kinase domain but lack key components present in the extracellular domain of EGFR which normally regulate its activity and ligand-dependence. The v-Erb-B oncogene was ligated to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER) which results in regulation of the activity of the v-Erb-ER construct by addition of either estrogen (E2) or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) to the culture media. Introduction of the v-Erb-B:ER construct into the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line increased the resistance to the cells to various chemotherapeutic drugs, hormonal-based therapeutics and IR. These results point to the important effects that aberrant expression of EGFR kinase domain can have on therapeutic resistance.",Excluded
4561,"Ribonuclear foci at the neuromuscular junction in myotonic dystrophy type 1 In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) the muscle fibers express RNA containing an expanded CUG repeat (CUG(exp)). The CUG(exp) RNA is retained in the nucleus, forming ribonuclear foci. Splicing factors in the muscleblind (MBNL) family are sequestered in ribonuclear foci, resulting in abnormal regulation of alternative splicing. In extrajunctional nuclei, these effects on splicing regulation lead to reduced chloride conductance and altered insulin receptor signaling. Here we show that CUG(exp) RNA is also expressed in subsynaptic nuclei of muscle fibers and in motor neurons in DM1, causing sequestration of MBNL1 protein in both locations. In a transgenic mouse model, expression of CUG(exp) RNA at high levels in extrajunctional nuclei replicates many features of DM1, but the toxic RNA is poorly expressed in subsynaptic nuclei and the mice fail to develop denervation-like features of DM1 myopathology. Our findings indicate that subsynaptic nuclei and motor neurons are at risk for DM1-induced spliceopathy, which may affect function or stability of the neuromuscular junction.",Excluded

Of 648 adult brain tumor patients who received radiation therapy at our institute, magnetic resonance (MR) image data consisting of a gradient echo (GRE) and FLAIR T2-weighted image were available three and five years after radiation therapy in 81 patients. Intracerebral hemorrhage was defined as a hypointense dot lesion appearing on GRE images after radiation therapy. The number and size of the lesions were evaluated. The T2 hyperintense WMLs observed on the FLAIR sequences were graded according to the extent of the lesion. Intracerebral hemorrhage was detected in 21 (25.9%) and 35 (43.2) patients in the three- and five-year follow-up images, respectively. The number of intracerebral hemorrhages per patient tended to increase as the follow-up period increased, whereas the size of the intracerebral hemorrhages exhibited little variation over the course of follow-up. T2 hyperintense WMLs were observed in 27 (33.3%) and 32 (39.5) patients in the three and five year follow-up images, respectively. The age at the time of radiation therapy was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the patients with T2 hyperintense WMLs than in those without lesions. Intracerebral hemorrhages are not uncommon in adult brain tumor patients undergoing radiation therapy. The incidence and number of intracerebral hemorrhages increased over the course of follow-up.

In studies investigating methylation and the role of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, the effect of this treatment upon the methylation itself is not well understood. We aimed to investigate any differences in methylation before or after treatment. Method(s): Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer were identified. Tumour tissue from pretreatment biopsies and post treatment resections for the same patients was subjected to DNA extraction. This was also modelled in vitro by administering ionizing radiation (7-15 Gy) to a colorectal cancer cell line and extracting DNA 48 hour later. Methylation specific PCR was used to characterize the methylation status of CpG islands in the promoter regions of 8 genes associated with rectal cancer. PCR band size and intensity was measured to give a semiquantiative analysis of methylation intensity in the cell line experiment. Result(s): 17 patients underwent analysis. Methylation was seen less frequently in post treatment specimens for all 8 markers, however, this difference was significant for one marker (ADAMTS1, 10/17 methylated pre vs 0/17 post, P = 0.001) and approached significance for another (hMLH1, 6/17 vs 1/17, P = 0.08). In the cell line study, methylation band intensity was significantly reduced above a dose of 10 Gy for both ADAMTS1 (P = 0.05) and NEUROG1 (P < 0.05) markers. Conclusion(s): Ionizing radiation appears to affect rectal cancer DNA methylation in patients and in an in vitro model. Further studies into this phenomenon are indicated, however, investigators should consider this when studying DNA methylation in patients undergoing radiation therapy.",Excluded
4226,"Reactive gliosis in the adult zebrafish retina In contrast to mammals, zebrafish posses the remarkable ability to regenerate retinal neurons. Damage to the zebrafish retina induces Muller glia to act as stem cells, generating retinal progenitors for regeneration. In contrast, injury in the mammalian retina results in Muller glial reactive gliosis, a characteristic gliotic response that is normally detrimental to vision. Understanding the signaling pathways that determine how Muller glia respond to injury is a critical step toward promoting regeneration in the mammalian retina. Here we report that zebrafish Muller glia exhibit signs of reactive gliosis even under normal regenerative conditions and that cell cycle inhibition increases this response. Persistently reactive Muller glia increase their neuroprotective functions, temporarily saving photoreceptors from a cytotoxic light lesion. However, the absence of a sustained proliferation response results in a significant inhibition of retinal regeneration. Interestingly, when cell cycle inhibition is released, a partial recovery of regeneration is observed. Together, these data demonstrate that zebrafish Muller glia possess both gliotic and regenerative potential.",Excluded

Initially, this exposure results in a depletion of the neuroglial population. By 10 days post-irradiation (P-I), gaps occur in the glia limitans, although the overlying basal lamina remains intact. Development of and myelination by intraspinal Schwann cells is well underway by 15 days P-I. These Schwann cell-occupied regions have a paucity of astrocyte processes, a finding which persists throughout the study (60 days P-I), and several types of Schwann cell-neuroglial interfaces are observed, including: (1) astrocyte separation of Schwann cells from oligodendrocyte-myelinated regions; (2) intermingling of Schwann cell-myelinated axons and oligodendrocyte-myelinated axons in the absence of astrocyte processes; and (3) ensheathment of unmyelinated axons by astrocyte processes which separate these axons from the Schwann cells. The gaps in the glia limitans widen as the P-I interval increases. At 45 and 60 days P-I, the basal lamina no longer forms a singular, continuous covering over the spinal cord surface, but follows instead a rather tortuous course over the disrupted glia limitans and the intraspinal Schwann cells.

The transdermal route of administration is worthy of investigation for patients who suffer from dysphagia due to severe oral mucositis. In this phase 2 study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of transdermal fentanyl (TDF) for mucositis pain caused by chemoradiotherapy in ESCC patients.METHODS: Forty-six ESCC patients who experienced moderate to severe oral mucosal pain during chemoradiotherapy received TDF for pain relief. The assessment of pain was made according to the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Efficacy and safety of TDF was collected and conducted in an open-label fashion. The analgesic effect, quality of life, and side effects were evaluated after the administration of transdermal fentanyl using the paired sample Wilcoxon signed rank test.RESULTS: The mucositis-induced pain disappeared in 31 (67.4 %) patients during the treatment with transdermal fentanyl with the median time of onset at day 6.6 (range 3-14). The median Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score was reduced from 6 (range 3-9) before treatment to 4.5 (range 2-9), 3 (range 2-8), 2.5 (range 1-8), 2 (range 0-6), and 0 (range 0-4) on days 3, 6, 9, 11, and 15, respectively, after treatment (P < 0.001).

Methods and Materials One hundred seventy-nine patients treated between 2011 and 2013 for VS RS and without trigeminal impairment before RS were included in a retrospective study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine predictors of TN among characteristics of the patients, the dosimetry, and the VS. Results There were 20 Koos grade 1, 99 grade 2, 57 grade 3, and 3 grade 4. Fourteen patients (7.8%) presented a transitory or permanent TN. Between the patients with and without TN after VS RS, there was no significant difference regarding dosimetry or VS volume itself. Significant differences (univariate analysis P<.05, Mann-Whitney test) were found for parameters related to the cisternal portion of the trigeminal nerve: total integrated dose, maximum dose, mean dose, volume of the Vth nerve (Vol<inf>v</inf>), and volume of the Vth nerve receiving at least 11 Gy (Vol<inf>Vcist>11Gy</inf>), but also for maximal dose to the Vth nerve nucleus and intra-axial portion (Dose max<inf>Vax</inf>).

Rats (n=21) were divided into three groups in which individual seizures were treated with rTMS trains at one of three frequencies: 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 Hz. EEG was continuously viewed by an operator who identified each seizure onset. Consecutive seizures in each animal were (1) treated with active rTMS, (2) treated with sham rTMS, or (3) were untreated. EEG was re-analyzed post hoc by visual inspection, and seizure durations were compared within and between treatment groups.RESULTS: KA-induced seizures were abbreviated by 0.75 Hz (P=0.019) and 0.5 Hz (P=0.033) active EEG-guided rTMS. In contrast, neither active 0.25 Hz rTMS nor the control conditions affected seizure duration (P>0.2).CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that EEG-guided rTMS can suppress seizures in the rat KA epilepsy model, and that the effect is frequency dependent, with 0.75 and 0.5 Hz rTMS being superior to 0.25 Hz rTMS.SIGNIFICANCE: These data support the use of rat seizure models in translational research aimed at evaluation and development of effective rTMS anticonvulsive protocols.

The reaction process of the rod visual pigment, rhodopsin, has been extensively investigated, whereas there have been few studies of cone visual pigments. Here we comprehensively investigated the reaction processes of cone visual pigments on a time scale of milliseconds to minutes, using flash photolysis equipment optimized for cone visual pigment photochemistry. We used chicken violet (L-group), chicken blue (M1-group), chicken green (M2-group), and monkey green (L-group) visual pigments as representatives of the respective groups of the phylogenetic tree of cone pigments. The S, M1, and M2 pigments showed the formation of a pH-dependent mixture of meta intermediates, similar to that formed from rhodopsin. Although monkey green (L-group) also formed a mixture of meta intermediates, pH dependency of meta intermediates was not observed. However, meta intermediates of monkey green became pH dependent when the chloride ion bound to the monkey green was replaced with a nitrate ion. These results strongly suggest that rhodopsin and S, M1, and M2 cone visual pigments share a molecular mechanism for activation, whereas the L-group pigment may have a special reaction mechanism involving the chloride-binding site.",Excluded
4466,"Acute exposure to low-level light at night is sufficient to induce neurological changes and depressive-like behavior The advent and wide-spread adoption of electric lighting over the past century has profoundly affected the circadian organization of physiology and behavior for many individuals in industrialized nations; electric lighting in homes, work environments, and public areas have extended daytime activities into the evening, thus, increasing night-time exposure to light. Although initially assumed to be innocuous, chronic exposure to light at night (LAN) is now associated with increased incidence of cancer, metabolic disorders, and affective problems in humans. However, little is known about potential acute effects of LAN. To determine whether acute exposure to low-level LAN alters brain function, adult male, and female mice were housed in either light days and dark nights (LD; 14 h of 150 lux:10 h of 0 lux) or light days and low level light at night (LAN; 14 h of 150 lux:10 h of 5 lux). Mice exposed to LAN on three consecutive nights increased depressive-like responses compared to mice housed in dark nights. In addition, female mice exposed to LAN increased central tendency in the open field. LAN was associated with reduced hippocampal vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in both male and female mice, as well as increased VEGFR1 and interleukin-1beta mRNA expression in females, and reduced brain derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in males. Further, LAN significantly altered circadian rhythms (activity and temperature) and circadian gene expression in female and male mice, respectively. Altogether, this study demonstrates that acute exposure to LAN alters brain physiology and can be detrimental to well-being in otherwise healthy individuals.",Excluded
4641,"Prolonged photoresponses in transgenic mouse rods lacking arrestin Arrestins are soluble cytoplasmic proteins that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors, thus switching off activation of the G protein and terminating the signalling pathway that triggers the cellular response. Although visual arrestin has been shown to quench the catalytic activity of photoexcited, phosphorylated rhodopsin in a reconstituted system, its role in the intact rod cell remains unclear because phosphorylation alone reduces the catalytic activity of rhodopsin. Here we have recorded photocurrents of rods from transgenic mice in which one or both copies of the arrestin gene were disrupted. Photoresponses were unaffected when arrestin expression was halved, indicating that arrestin binding is not rate limiting for recovery of the rod photoresponse, as it is in Drosophila. With arrestin absent, the flash response displayed a rapid partial recovery followed by a prolonged final phase. This behaviour indicates that an arrestin-independent mechanism initiates the quench of rhodopsin's catalytic activity and that arrestin completes the quench. The intensity dependence of the photoresponse in rods lacking arrestin further suggests that, although arrestin is required for normal signal termination, it does not participate directly in light adaptation.",Excluded

Furthermore, patients suffering from depression exhibit increased superficial pain thresholds and decreased ischemic (deep) pain thresholds during experimental pain testing in comparison to healthy controls. Here, we aimed to investigate a putative role of Adelta- and C-fibre activation in altered pain perception in the disease. Laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) of 27 unmedicated depressed patients and 27 matched controls were recorded. Adelta and C fibres were activated separately. Amplitudes and latencies of N2 and P2 peaks of Adelta- (Adelta-LEP) and C-fibre- (C-LEP) related LEPs were evaluated. Depressed patients showed significantly decreased Adelta-LEP amplitudes (N2 peak: P=0.019; P2 peak: P=0.024) and delayed C-LEP latencies (P2 peak: P=0.0495; N2 peak: P=0.0556). In contrast, C-LEP amplitudes and Adelta-LEP latencies were unaffected. Our results might be suggestive of the differential impact of physiological changes on pain processing in depression. Thus, Adelta-LEP might reflect the physiological correlate of the augmented superficial pain thresholds during depression. On the contrary, the C-fibre component mediates the facets of pain processing, outlasting the stimulation period, and has been shown to be exaggerated in chronic pain states. Therefore, the functional over-representation of the C-fibre component found in our study might be a possible link between depression and associated pain complaints.",Excluded
4221,"Thermography for perfusion analysis of the thoracic region after bypass grafting The use of the left internal thoracic artery for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is associated with higher long-term patency rates compared to autologous saphenous vein grafts. However, due to the devascularisation of the thoracic region there is a potential of postoperative sternal wound infection, occurring in approximately 4 % of all patients. To this day, there is still no preoperative diagnostic procedure to estimate the risk of a wound healing disorder. Thermography has proved to be suitable for medical imaging in breast cancer detection, brain mapping in neurosurgery, and dermatology among others. The measurement of thermal radiation is a highly sensitive, noninvasive and label-free methodology that allows for the identification of vital signs and the discrimination of normal from pathological tissue. In this contribution, thermal imaging is used to quantify the perfusion of the thoracic region of patients before and after CABG. We propose a method for the assessment of blood flow by evaluating the skin temperature of the left and right breast areas in a comparative study 1 day before the surgery and 2 hours, 1 day, and 7 days after surgery, respectively. As expected, the examined group of patients showed a hypoperfusion of left chest wall, indicated by a significant temperature drop compared to the right breast area. Postoperative we observe a continuous convergence in the skin temperatures of the left and right breast areas as an effect of revascularization in the left thoracic region. As a proof of concept, we show the feasibility to evaluate the perfusion of the thoracic region using contact-free thermal imaging. This lays the foundation for preoperative diagnostics in order to assess the risk of wound healing disorders.",Excluded
4328,"Alveolar echinococcosis mimicking multiple metastatic tumors: A case presentation Objective: We aim to present a case with alveolar echinococcosis (AE) with presenting symptom ataxi and seizures. Background(s): AE is a chronic and lethal parasitic infection caused by the helminth echinococcus multilocularis (EM). The disease is endemic in Turkey particularly in the Eastern Anatolia Region. Cysts of AE may involve lots of organs like lung, spleen, kidneys, heart, bone and brain and imitate a malign tumor. Method(s): A 31 years old male patient was admitted to our clinic due ataxi and seizures. Neurological examination revealed mildly impaired orientation and mentation, hemiparesis on right extremites and bilateral extensor Babinski sign. We have learned from his medical history he has been diagnosed as metastases of the lung and brain originating from the primary liver malignancy using PET-CT imaging and brain metastases have been treated by radiation theraphy recently. MR examination of brain demonstrated well-defined round hypointense lesions on T1-weighted images and hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images on the parietal, occipital, frontal, temporal and cerebellar regions of the brain. Surrounding oedema and ringshaped contrast enhancement were seen the walls of the cystic lesions. The results of an indirect echinococcal hemagglutination test were positive. PAS-positive granular membrane pieces concordant with alveolar echinococcosis were seen in necrotic areas of the specimen obtained from the brain lesion. Result(s): Finally the patient was diagnosed as alveolar hydatid disease of the liver with lung and brain metastasis with clinic and radiological findings, serological test result and pathological examination. The lesion in the liver was accepted as nonresectable due to invasion of the portal and hepatic vein. Long-term albendazole treatment was started at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day and levetiracetam was ordered 2000 mg/day for seizures, his symptoms improved partially and the patient was discharged. Conclusion(s): AE should be remembered as a rare and treatable cause in sama case.",Excluded
4462,"Role of short TE 1H-MR spectroscopy in monitoring of post-operation irradiated patients Post-surgical radiation therapy is a routine procedure in the treatment of primary malignant brain tumors. Along with modest therapeutic effects conventional fractionated radiotherapy, in spite of any modifications, produces damage to non-malignant brain tissues lying within the treatment volume, the extent of which depends on radiation dose. Serial 1H-MRS allows non-invasive investigation of tissue metabolic profiles. In the present study the ratios of resonance signals assigned to the major 1H-MRS-visible metabolites (N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine, inositol, lactate and lipid methylene group) were evaluated before, during and after post-surgical fractionated radiotherapy in brain regions close to and more distant from the tumor bed, receiving different radiation exposures (60 and < 40 Gy, respectively). The study group consisted of ten patients (aged 28-51). A MRI/MRS system (Elscint 2T Prestige) operating at the field strength of 2 T and the proton resonance frequency of 81.3 MHz has been used and the 1H-MR spectra were acquired using single voxel double-spin-echo PRESS sequence with a short TE. The spectra were post-processed with automatic fitting in the frequency domain. It was found that although the metabolite profiles depend on the dose obtained, but other stress factors (like surgery) seem to contribute to the overall picture of the metabolic status of the brain as well. In studies of early irradiation injuries, an increase of choline related ratios may serve rather as cell proliferation indictors than as cell injury ones, whereas the mI/Cr ratio appears as one of the first indicators of local irradiation injury. In order to establish the prognostic marker for early radiation damage, however, it seems necessary to analyze all visible metabolites as well. None of the metabolites separately may serve as such an indicator due to the complexity of tissue metabolism. Interestingly, MRI reveals no changes during the therapy process, whereas the metabolite ratios are being affected in the course of time, thus supporting the presumption that the 1H-MRS is a valuable method of radiation therapy monitoring.",Excluded

The RFs emanated from dipole antennas (1 W average output) 2.0 +/- 0.5 cm from the tip of each rat's nose. The RFs had an 860 MHz frequency, and the specific absorption rate was 1.0 W/ kg averaged over the brain. Fifteen groups of 60 rats (900 total) were formed from offspring of females injected i.v. with 0 (groups 1, 2, 9, 10, 13), 2.5 (groups 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14) or 10 mg/kg (groups 3, 4, 15) ethylnitrosourea (ENU) to induce brain tumors.

All rats but 2, totaling 898, were necropsied, and major tissues were studied histopathologically. There was no statistically significant evidence that the PRF or CWRF induced neoplasia in any tissues. Additionally, there was no significant evidence of promotion of cranial or spinal nerve or spinal cord tumors. The PRF or CWRF had no statistically significant effect on the number, volume, location, multiplicity, histological type, malignancy or fatality of brain tumors. There was a trend for the group that received a high dose of ENU and was exposed to the PRF to develop fatal brain tumors at a higher rate than its sham group; however, the result was not significant using the log-rank test (P = 0.14, 2-tailed). No statistically significant differences were related to the PRF or CWRF compared to controls in the low- or zero-dose groups regarding tumors of any kind.

4583,"The effect of biological effective dose on time to symptom progression in metastatic renal cell carcinoma AIMS: Renal cell carcinoma is commonly thought to be a radioresistant malignancy. Retrospective studies report conflicting results on the effect of radiotherapy dose escalation on response and time to progression in symptomatic metastatic disease; studies using the linear quadratic model have used alpha/beta ratios that are inappropriate for slow growing tumours. We aim to describe our experience with palliative radiotherapy in this context, relating Biological Effective Dose to outcome.MATERIALS AND METHODS: From December 1995 to April 2001, 143 independent palliative radiotherapy treatments were delivered to 78 patients in a single institution. Retrospective data was obtained on the radiotherapy schedule used, symptom response and time to symptom progression. The biological effective dose (BED) was calculated using alpha/beta ratios of 3 and 7 Gy (BED3 and BED7). The Log-Rank test was used to assess any differences in time to progression, and the Cox Proportional Hazards analysis to determine prognostic factors of time to progression.RESULTS: Overall symptomatic response rate was 73%, with most responses being partial (67%). Forty-three (38%) patients had symptomatic progression after a median follow-up of 425 days. BED (BED3 or BED7) was not significantly different across response types (complete, partial or no response; P=0.90 and 0.88, respectively) and was not predictive for time to symptomatic progression (P=0.99 for BED3 and P=0.70 for BED7). Patients with bone metastases received less total dose (P=0.001), less BED (BED3, P=0.0013, and BED7, P=0.0005) and had a significantly longer time to progression than other sites of metastases (hazard ratio (HR) 0.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.7; P=0.004). Initial treatment with interferon-alpha alone in patients presenting with metastatic disease, before palliative radiotherapy, was also associated with a shorter time to symptom progression (HR 4.6; 95% CI 1.5-14.1; P=0.007). On removal of these criteria, brain metastases became a significant predictor of progression time, with an HR of 2.5 (95% CI 1.0-5.9; P=0.05), showing an increased risk of progression with brain metastases compared with metastases elsewhere. Time from primary diagnosis to development of metastatic disease was not predictive of time to symptom progression (P=0.29).CONCLUSION: Despite the widespread assumption that renal cell carcinoma is radioresistant, retrospective assessment showed high response rates to palliative radiotherapy. On the basis of our data, higher BED does not seem to be a predictor of response or of duration of response in the palliative treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Palliation of bone pain seems to be particularly durable compared with the palliation of symptoms at other sites of metastases. A trend for shorter duration of palliative effect of whole-brain radiotherapy was noted.",Excluded

Seeds were counted on radiographs from CT simulation, first treatment and last treatment. Retention and use of at least three markers for kV/kV matching was considered a successful implant. A visual analogue scale (VAS) pain assessment was performed. SAS was used for data analysis.RESULTS: Fiducial marker placement was successful for kV/kV matching in 556/581 patients (95.7%). The procedure was aborted due to pain in two patients. Additional sedation during the procedure was required in two patients. Complications include urinary infections (2 patients, <0.5%) and transient haematuria (2 patients, <0.5%). There were no recorded calls requesting additional pain medication or delays in radiation due to complications. The number of seeds identified at simulation: 4 (2 patients), 3 (554 patients), 2 (21 patients), 1 (1 patient), 0 (1 patient). One patient with three seeds and two patients with <2 seeds had cone beam CT instead of kV/kV imaging for image guidance. No seeds were lost after simulation. The mean visual analogue pain score associated with transperineal gold seed insertion met patients' expectations (respectively 4.1 vs. 4.4 P = 0.19).CONCLUSION: Outpatient transperineal insertion of fiducials avoids the rectum, is effective, convenient, well tolerated and has few side effects.",Excluded
4329,"Cerebromicrovascular dysfunction predicts cognitive decline and gait abnormalities in a mouse model of whole brain irradiation-induced accelerated brain senescence Whole brain irradiation (WBI) is a mainstream therapy for patients with both identifiable brain metastases and prophylaxis for microscopic malignancies. However, it also promotes accelerated senescence in healthy tissues and leads to progressive cognitive dysfunction in up to 50% of tumor patients surviving long term after treatment, due to gamma-irradiation-induced cerebromicrovascular injury. Moment-to-moment adjustment of cerebral blood flow (CBF) via neuronal activity-dependent cerebromicrovascular dilation (functional hyperemia) has a critical role in maintenance of healthy cognitive function. To determine whether cognitive decline induced by WBI associates with impaired cerebromicrovascular function, C56BL/6 mice (3 months) subjected to a clinically relevant protocol of fractionated WBI (5 Gy twice weekly for 4 weeks) and control mice were compared. Mice were tested for spatial memory performance (radial arm water maze), sensorimotor coordination (computerized gait analysis, CatWalk), and cerebromicrovascular function (whisker-stimulation-induced increases in CBF, measured by laser Doppler flowmetry) at 3 to 6 months post-irradiation. We found that mice with WBI exhibited impaired cerebromicrovascular function at 3 months post-irradiation, which was associated with impaired performance in the radial arm water maze. At 6 months, post-irradiation progressive impairment in gait coordination (including changes in the regularity index and phase dispersion) was also evident. Collectively, our findings provide evidence for early and persisting neurovascular impairment after a clinically relevant protocol of fractionated WBI, which predict early manifestations of cognitive impairment.",Included
4197,"Microstimulation of V1 delays visually guided saccades: a parametric evaluation of delay fields Electrical microstimulation of macaque striate cortex (area V1) delays the execution of saccadic eye movements made to a visual target placed in the receptive field of the stimulated neurons. The region of visual space within which saccades are delayed is called a delay field. We examined the effects of changing the parameters of stimulation and target size on the size of a delay field. Rhesus monkeys were required to generate a saccadic eye movement to a punctate and white visual target presented within or outside the receptive field of the neurons under study. On 50% of trials, a train of stimulation consisting of 0.2-ms anode-first pulses was delivered to the neurons before the onset of the visual target. Stimulations were performed in the operculum at 0.9-2.0 mm below the cortical surface. It was found that increases in current (50-100 microA), pulse frequency (100-300 Hz), or train duration (75-300 ms) increased the size of a delay field and increases in target size (0.1 degrees -0.2 degrees of visual angle) decreased the size of a delay field. Delay fields varied in size between 0.1 and 0.6 degrees of visual angle. These results are related to the properties of phosphenes induced by electrical stimulation of V1 in humans and compared to the interference effects observed following transcranial magnetic stimulation of human V1.",Excluded
4404,"Space, gravity and the physiology of aging: parallel or convergent disciplines? A mini-review The abnormal physiology that manifests itself in healthy humans during their adaptation to the microgravity of space has all the features of accelerated aging. The mechano-skeletal and vestibulo-neuromuscular stimuli which are below threshold in space, result in an overall greater than 10-fold more rapid onset and time course of muscle and bone atrophy in space and the development of balance and coordination problems on return to Earth than occur with aging. Similarly, the loss of functional capacity of the cardiovascular system that results in space and continuous bed rest is over 10 times faster than in the course of aging. Deconditioning in space from gravity deprivation has brought attention to the medical hazards of deconditioning on Earth from gravity withdrawal as in sedentary aging. Though seemingly reversible after periods of 6 months in space or its ground analog of bed rest, it remains to be seen whether that will be so after longer exposures. Both adaptation to space and aging do not merely parallel but converge as disorders of mechanotransduction. Like spaceflight, its analog bed rest telescopes the changes observed with aging and serves as a useful clinical model for the study of age-related deconditioning. The convergence of the disciplines of aging, along with gravitational and space physiology is advancing the understanding and prevention of modern lifestyle medical disorders.",Excluded
3871,"Brain dysplasia evoked by gamma irradiation at different stages of prenatal development leads to different tonic and clonic seizure reactivity Rats with brain dysplasia evoked by interruption of different stages of prenatal neurogenesis show characteristic variations in susceptibility to seizures depending on the neurochemical specificity of pharmacological agents used to evoke seizures. To verify a discrepancy between the data obtained using different pharmacological models, neurochemically neutral electroshocks were applied here. To produce brain dysplasia of different degrees, pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to a single 1.0. Gy dose of gamma rays on gestation days 13, 15, 17 or 19. From the postnatal day 60, their male offspring (E13s, E15s, E17s and E19s, respectively) were subjected to 21 daily electrical stimulations to evoke seizures. Profiles of tonic and clonic reactivity to electrical stimulation significantly differed from those observed following pilocarpine or kainic acid administration. E17s showed minimal intensity of tonic but maximal of clonic responses. On the contrary, very high tonic and low clonic reactivity was observed in E13s and E15s. Periventricular nodular heterotopias (PNHs) were observed exclusively in E15s and E17s. Generally, the size of PNHs was correlated positively with susceptibility to tonic seizures but negatively with susceptibility to clonic seizures. Analogous correlations with the size of the neocortex were opposite. E13s and E19s had brains devoid PNHs but showed high tonic seizure susceptibility similar to that in E15s. It can therefore be concluded that PNHs modified the type of seizure reactivity from tonic to clonic, depending of their size, but the presence of PNHs was not necessary for the development of seizure susceptibility itself.

4335,"Clinical Evaluation of a Rotational Set-up Correction Device for Multiple Brain Metastases Using Single-Isocenter Stereotactic Radiation Therapy Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) using a single plan with one isocenter by helical tomotherapy (HT) can simultaneously treat multiple brain metastases with highly conformal dose distributions. This may reduce treatment time and intra-fractional motion. However, rotational set-up errors in the pitch and yaw angles cannot be corrected in the HT system. Therefore, increases in rotational set-up error and distance of the target-to-rotational-center may be associated with significant dosimetric uncertainties with this irradiation technique. Previous research shows that when rotational errors are increased to 2.0degree, the prescription doses which cover 95% of the planning target volume were only 63% of all tested cases. Here, we developed a new head supporting device that allows for a highly-accurate correction of rotational errors during image-guided radiation therapy. In this study, we investigated the amounts of rotational correction required prior to irradiation, and evaluated the dosimetric efficacy of rotational correction for SRT, using HT unit to treat multiple brain metastases. Materials/Methods: A novel rotational set-up correction device was constructed from carbon material and conjected with the commonly-used head shell system on the top of our device. We were able to rotate in 0.1degree increments for pitch and yaw angles using two screws. We retrospectively analyzed data from three patients irradiated by single-isocenter SRT for multiple brain metastases using the HT unit. The SRT plans were created with 30 Gy in three fractions prescribed for D99% to clinical target volumes. The required rotational correction values were determined by mega-voltage computed tomography (MVCT) before irradiation. Residual correction values were quantified after correction by the developed device. Moreover, dosimetric efficacy was evaluated using the calculated dose distribution with MVCT after rotational correction. Dose distribution was compared between 4D (three horizontal axes + roll) and 6D correction. We clarified efficacy of rotational correction depending on the distance of the target-to-rotational-center. Result(s): The rotational correction for pitch was 1.2degree +/- 1.7degree, roll: 0.9degree +/- 1.2degree, and yaw: 1.3degree +/- 1.6degree. The maximum correction value in pitch and yaw was 3.0degree. The residual correction value after rotational correction was 0.2degree +/- 0.3degree in both pitch and yaw angles. The difference in target dose between 4D and 6D corrections was improved by 2.5% in coverage index, and 1.0% on D99%. Dosimetric efficacy of rotational correction did not depend on the distance of the target-to-rotational-center. This suggests that irradiated doses for brain metastases in any location can be improved. Conclusion(s): Novel rotational set-up correction device can be corrected to within 0.5degree in pitch and yaw angle error, and benefited rotational correction and irradiated dose distribution for single-isocenter SRT for multiple brain metastases.

She presented in April 2016 with sudden onset severe pelvic pain and stiffness, which within days rendered her immobile. The symptoms had been preceded by mild flu like illness. Clinically she had no systemic features but on examination demonstrated significant bilateral pelvic girdle weakness and pain. There was no distal neurological deficit and no clinical findings suggesting an SLE flare. Working diagnosis was of myositis, possibly secondary to SLE. Method(s): Serology showed an acute phase response (CRP 298), normal CK, complement levels, ANA and dsDNA. Renal function was normal and there was no evidence of lupus nephritis. Within a week of admission she underwent a pelvic MRI (with STIR), which showed florid inflammation within the muscles of her pelvis. When compared to the map of her radiotherapy treatment, the area almost exactly matched. This changed her working diagnosis to include delayed onset radiotherapy-induced myositis. Result(s): Her inflammatory markers remained markedly elevated (CRP >250). She was due to start high dose steroids for treatment of myositis to cover any potential inflammatory component, in the knowledge that evidence for steroid use and success in radiation induced myositis was sparse and had modest success at best. Incidentally she was found to have intermittent genito-urinary symptoms over the preceding 4-5 months, including dyspareunia and intermittent purulent discharge. She had no other signs to suggest sepsis and observations were all normal. A high vaginal swab grew Group G streptococcus, which, following extensive gynaecology review investigation was subsequently found to be due to a small abscess inside the vagina. It was not amenable to surgical drainage and was treated conservatively with antibiotics. Within 2 weeks of antibiotics therapy, analgesia and physiotherapy for her reduced mobility, her inflammatory markers improved and her pain started to improve. She underwent an open muscle biopsy under GA which was inconclusive. Antibiotics were continued and after 3 weeks of inpatient IV treatment her inflammatory markers showed a dramatic improvement. Her pain gradually improved along with it, as did her mobility. Conclusion(s): She was discharged from hospital with a prolonged course of antibiotics and continues to make great progress. Steroids treatment is still on hold until infection cleared and recovery of function established.

Investigations for effective and non-toxic compounds with radioprotective capability led to increasing interest in antioxidant such as thymoquinone (TQ). Objective(s): The aim of this study was to evaluate the radioprotective effects of TQ on oxidant/antioxidant systems in the tongue-tissue of rats exposed to total cranial irradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-two rats were divided into four groups to test the radioprotective effectiveness of TQ administered by either orogastric tube or intraperitoneal injection.

To understand extravasation kinetics and extravascular organ concentrations of AlbudAbs in humans, we studied tissue distribution and elimination of a non-conjugated <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeled AlbudAb in healthy volunteers using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Method(s): A non-conjugated AlbudAb (GSK3128349) was radiolabeled with <sup>89</sup>Zr and a single 1 mg (~ 15 MBq) dose intravenously administered to eight healthy males. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb tissue distribution was followed for up to 7 days with four whole-body PET/CT scans. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb tissue concentrations were quantified in organs of therapeutic significance, measuring standardized uptake value and tissue/plasma ratios. Plasma pharmacokinetics were assessed by gamma counting and LC-MS/MS of blood samples. Result(s): <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb administration and PET/CT procedures were well tolerated, with no drug-related immunogenicity or adverse events. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb rapidly distributed throughout the vasculature, with tissue/plasma ratios in the liver, lungs, and heart relatively stable over 7 days post-dose, ranging between 0.1 and 0.5. The brain tissue/plasma ratio of 0.025 suggested minimal AlbudAb blood-brain barrier penetration. Slowly increasing ratios in muscle, testis, pancreas, and spleen reflected either slow AlbudAb penetration and/or <sup>89</sup>Zr residualization in these organs. Across all tissues evaluated, the kidney tissue/plasma ratio was highest (0.5-1.5 range) with highest concentration in the renal cortex. The terminal half-life of the <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb was 18 days. Conclusion(s): Evaluating the biodistribution of <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb in healthy volunteers using a low radioactivity dose was successful (total subject exposure ~ 10 mSv).

Sixteen adult male rats, kept under a 12: 12 h light-dark cycle, were divided into two groups of freely moving (n=8) and HU (n=8) rats. The volume of motor cortex and hippocampus, the numerical cell density of neurons in layers I, II-III, V, and VI of the motor cortex, the entire motor cortex as well as the primary motor cortex, and the numerical density of the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus subregions of the hippocampus were estimated. No significant differences were observed in the evaluated parameters. Our results thus indicated that motor cortical and hippocampal atrophy and cell loss may not necessarily be involved in the motion and spatial learning memory impairment in the rat.

4517,"Daxx Functions Are p53-Independent In Vivo Mutations in the death domain-associated protein (DAXX) have been recently identified in a substantial proportion of human pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). Remarkably, however, little is known about the physiologic role(s) of DAXX despite in vitro studies suggesting potential functions. Most prominently, and supported by tumor sequencing data, DAXX functions in concert with alpha thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) as a histone chaperone complex for the H3.3 variant. Studies have also identified potential roles in apoptosis, transcription, and negative regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. Herein, a mouse modeling approach was used to specifically address the latter and no significant genetic interaction between Daxx and the p53 pathway was determined. The embryonic lethal phenotype of Daxx loss is not p53-dependent. In addition, Daxx heterozygosity does not sensitize mice to a sublethal dose of ionizing radiation or alter the survival or tumor phenotype of Mdm2 transgenic mice. However, the data support a tumor suppressor role for DAXX as low-dose ionizing radiation produced a higher proportion of carcinomas in Daxx heterozygous mice than wild-type controls. <b>Implications:</b> While DAXX has important in vivo functions, they are independent of an inhibitory role on the p53 tumor suppressor pathway.

4675,"Boron neutron capture therapy of brain tumors: functional and neuropathologic effects of blood-brain barrier disruption and intracarotid injection of sodium borocaptate and boronophenylalanine Sodium borocaptate (BSH) and boronophenylalanine (BPA) are two drugs that have been used clinically for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) of brain tumors. We previously have reported that hyperosmotic mannitol-induced disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB-D), followed by intracarotid (i.c.) administration of BPA or BSH, either individually or in combination, significantly enhanced tumor boron delivery and the efficacy of BNCT in F98 glioma bearing rats. The purpose of the present study was to determine the short-term neuropathologic consequences of this treatment and the long-term effects on motor and cognitive function, as well as the neuropathologic sequelae 1 year following neutron capture irradiation. BBB-D was carried out in non-tumor bearing Fischer rats by infusing a 25% solution of mannitol i.c. followed by i.c. injection of BPA or BSH, either individually or in combination, immediately thereafter. Animals were euthanized 2 days after compound administration, and their brains were processed for neuropathologic examination, which revealed sporadic, mild, focal neuronal degeneration, hemorrhage, and necrosis. To assess the long-term effects of such treatment followed by neutron capture irradiation, non-tumor bearing rats were subjected to BBB-D after which they were injected i.c. with BPA (25 mg B/kg body weight (b.w)) or BSH (30 mg B/kg b.w.) either individually or in combination (BPA 12.5 mg and BSH 14 mg B/kg b.w.). Two and a half hours later they were irradiated at the Medical Research Reactor, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, with the same physical radiation doses (5.79, 8.10 or 10.06 Gy), delivered to the brain, as those that previously had been used for our therapy experiments. The animals tolerated this procedure well, after which they were returned to Columbus, Ohio where their clinical status was monitored weekly. After 1 year, motor function was assessed using a sensitive and reliable locomotor rating scale for open field testing in rats and cognitive function was evaluated by their performance in the Morris water maze, the results of which were similar to those obtained with age matched controls. After functional evaluation, the rats were euthanized, their brains were removed, and then processed for neuropathologic examination. Subtle histopathologic changes were seen in the choroid plexuses of irradiated animals that had received BPA, BSH or saline. Radiation related ocular changes consisting of keratitis, blepharitis, conjunctivitis and cataract formation were seen with similar frequency in most rats in each treatment group. Based on these observations, and the previously reported significant therapeutic gain associated with BBB-D and i.c. injection of BSH and BPA, the present observations establish its safety in rats and suggest that further studies in large animals and humans are warranted.",Included
4578,"Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions and Intracranial Pressure During CSF Infusion Testing BACKGROUND: A noninvasive method to monitor changes in intracranial pressure (ICP) is required for astronauts on long-duration spaceflight who are at risk of developing the Visual Impairment/Intracranial Pressure syndrome that has some, but not all of the features of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. We assessed the validity of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) to detect changes in ICP.METHODS: Subjects were eight patients undergoing medically necessary diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infusion testing for hydrocephalus. DPOAE measurements were obtained with an FDA-approved system at baseline and six controlled ICP levels in ~3 mmHg increments in random order, with a range from 10.8 +/- 2.9 mmHg (SD) at baseline to 32.3 +/- 4.1 mmHg (SD) at level 6.RESULTS: For f2 frequencies between 800 and 1700 Hz, when ICP was >= 12 mmHg above baseline ICP, DPOAE angles increased significantly and DPOAE magnitudes decreased significantly, but less robustly.DISCUSSION: Significant changes in DPOAE angle and magnitude are seen when ICP is >= 12 mmHg above a subject's supine baseline ICP during CSF infusion testing. These results suggest that the changes in DPOAE angle and magnitude seen with change in ICP are physiologically based, and suggest that it should be possible to detect pathological ICP elevation using DPOAE measurements. To use DPOAE for noninvasive estimation of ICP during spaceflight will require baseline measurements in the head-up, supine, and head-down positions to obtain baseline DPOAE values at different ICP ranges.

3814,"Motion sickness: Part III. A clinical study based on surgery of posterior fossa tumors Three patients who had large, benign cerebellar tumors were operated upon in the sitting position and developed symptoms referable to the temporoparieto-occipital region of the brain 24-48 h postoperatively. They consisted of dizziness, nausea, vomiting, formed and unformed hallucinations, and inversion of image or disorientation in space, some of which were experienced by some of the astronauts and cosmonauts during space flight. Such findings are not due to stimulation of the cerebellum, the site of the lesion, but must come from the cerebral hemisphere. The symptoms were believed to be caused by 'the luxury perfusion' of Lassen with the development of local lactic acidosis secondary to vascular insufficiency to the brain in the distribution of the posterior cerebral artery thus stimulating the temporoparieto-occipital region. This theory is suggested to some degree by the work of Endo et al. using CT scans, which showed the shifting of increased blood flow from the frontal region to the temporoparieto-occipital region following removal of a benign posterior fossa tumor. The mechanism for the compression of the posterior cerebral artery may be due to uncal herniation at the tentorium. The authors believe that it might be well to consider further testing in a vertical or oblique plane rather than only in a centrifugal horizontal one. This method would tend to cause uncal herniation more readily. Monitoring of such effects could be done with the colored CT scan.",Excluded
4065,"Repolarized macrophages, induced by intermediate stereotactic dose radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade, contribute to long-term survival in glioma-bearing mice INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a deadly brain tumor with a short expected median survival, despite current standard-of-care treatment. We explored the combination of intermediate stereotactic dose radiation therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy as a novel treatment strategy for GBM.METHODS: Glioma xenograft-bearing mice were exposed to high dose brain-directed radiation (10 Gy single exposure) as well as mouse anti-PD-1 antibody. The tumor-bearing animals were randomized to four groups: no treatment, radiation alone, anti-PD-1 alone, and radiation + anti-PD-1. Survival was followed, and tumor growth was monitored using MRI. Immunohistochemistry, gene expression arrays, and flow cytometry were used to characterize the treatment-induced effects. Pharmacologic inhibitors of T-lymphocytes, bone marrow derived macrophages, and microglia were used to assess the respective roles of different immune populations in observed treatment effects.RESULTS: We found the combined treatment with high dose radiation and immunotherapy to be highly effective with a 75% complete pathologic response and dramatically improved survival outcomes. We found both CD8+ T-cells and macrophages to be necessary for the full effect of combined therapy, with T lymphocytes appearing to play a role early on and macrophages mediating a later phase of the combined treatment effect. Radiation treatment appeared to trigger macrophage repolarization, increasing M1/M2 ratio.CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to a novel immunologic mechanism underlying the interaction between radiotherapy and immunotherapy. They also provide the basis for clinical investigation of immunogenic dose radiation in combination with immune checkpoint blockade as a potential treatment approach for newly diagnosed high grade gliomas.",Excluded
4288,"Long-term results of hyperfractionated radiation therapy and concomitant chemotherapy for T3 and T4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): The optimal fractionation schedule for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) involving the base of skull and intracranium is unknown.We found hyperfractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) and concomitant chemotherapy (CCT) could achieve better local control and survival in NPC patients with T3 and T4 lesions at 3 year follow up. To confirm the effect of this approach, we analyzed more patients with long term follow up. Materials/Methods: From January 1992 to Dec 2003, 222 patients (74 T3 and 148 T4 NPC) were treated with hyperfractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) and concomitant chemotherapy (CCT). HFRT was administered at 1.2 Gy per fraction, two fractions per day, Monday-Friday for 62 fractions for a total dose of 74.4 Gy. Concomitant chemotherapy consisting of cis-diamino-dichloroplatinum (CDDP) alone or CDDP and 5-fluorouracil were delivered simultaneously with radiotherapy during Weeks 1 and 6. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of CDDP and 5-fluorouracil for 2 to 3 cycles and was given monthly beginning 1 month after completion of radiation. Result(s):With a median follow-up of 102 months (range: 5 - 186 months), the 5-year locoregional control rate, distant-metastasis free, disease-free and overall survivals were 81.9%, 78.5%, 65.5% and 73.6%, respectively. At 10 years, the 10-year locoregional control rate, distant-metastasis free, disease-free and overall survivals were 76.7%, 75.5%, 60.5% and 64.2%, respectively. For T4 patients, the 10-year locoregional control rate, distant-metastasis free, disease-free and overall survivals were 73.0%, 70.5%, 53.0% and 58.4%, respectively. The major chronic toxicity was Grade 3/4 hearing impairment in 14% of patients. Brain necrosis rate is 2.3%. Conclusion(s): HFRT and CCT for T3 and T4 NPC were associated with good local control, survival and little treatment-related long term toxicity. But, the 10 year treatment result is suboptimal. To further improve the 10 year locoregional control rate for T4 NPC patients, we may consider using HFRT to give higher radiation dose up to 78 Gy with CCT in the IMRT era.",Excluded
4542,"Comparison of robotic-assisted carotid stenting and manual carotid stenting through the transradial approach OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of CorPath GRX robotic-assisted (RA) transradial (TR) carotid artery stenting (CAS) compared with manual TR CAS. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database and identified 13 consecutive patients who underwent TR CAS from June 2019 through February 2020. Patients were divided into 2 groups: RA (6 patients) and manual (7 patients). RESULTS Among 6 patients in the RA group with a mean age of 70.0 +/- 7.2 years, technical success was achieved in all 6 (100%) procedures; there were no technical or access-site complications and no catheter exchanges. Transfemoral conversion was required in 1 (16.7%) case due to a tortuous aortic arch. There were no perioperative complications, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and mortality. The mean procedure duration was significantly longer in the RA group (85.0 +/- 14.3 minutes [95% CI 69.9-100.0] vs 61.2 +/- 17.5 minutes [95% CI 45.0-77.4], p = 0.0231). There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics, fluoroscopy time, contrast dose, radiation exposure, catheter exchanges, technical success, transfemoral conversion, technical or access-site complications, myocardial infarction, stroke, other complications, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS The authors' results suggest that RA TR CAS is feasible, safe, and effective. Neurovascular-specific engineering and software modifications are needed prior to complete remote control. Remote control has important implications regarding patient access to lifesaving procedures for conditions such as stroke and aneurysm rupture as well as operative precision. Future clinical investigations among larger cohorts are needed to demonstrate reliable performance and patient benefit. Copyright Â© AANS 2021.",Excluded
3655,"Effects of escitalopram challenge on white matter integrity in obsessive-compulsive disorder and healthy controls Background: Involvement of the serotonergic system in OCD is well-known, with OCD responding to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Chronic use of SSRIs changes brain connectivity in OCD, and a single dose of an SSRI dramatically alters functional connectivity throughout the brain in healthy subjects. The question is raised whether acute administration of an SSRI can also significantly alter white matter integrity in the brain of patients with OCD. Method(s): OCD patients (n=20) and matched healthy controls (n=24) received a single dose of escitalopram 20mg on one day, and a single dose of placebo on another day, in randomized order, under double-blind conditions. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to compare white matter integrity of the whole brain between the groups. The impact of the SSRI challenge on white matter in these two study groups were subsequently investigated, controlling for age. Result(s): There were no significant interaction effects (diagnostic group x pharmacological challenge) or effects in the OCD group separately. In controls, the escitalopram challenge had a significant impact on white matter diffusivity of the left post thalamic radiation (PTR-L) (F=7.84; p=0.01), the superior corona radiata bilaterally (SCR: F=7.99; p=0.01) and the sagittal stratum bilaterally (SS: F=6.64; p=0.02). In these tracts, FA was significantly higher and RD significantly lower after the pharmacological challenge compared to placebo. Discussion(s): Acute administration of an SSRI did not significantly alter white matter integrity in the brain of OCD patients. It did however improve white matter integrity in tracts that connect regions that may be affected in OCD, in controls. DTI-derived parameters are differently affected in OCD and healthy controls, respectively, in structures within the fronto-striatothalamo-cortical loop after chronic SSRI treatment. Alteration of white matter integrity may occur in OCD with longer treatment duration or at a different dosage with plasticity potentially playing a role.",Excluded
4553,"Effects of delta-conotoxins PVIA and SVIE on sodium channels in the amphibian sympathetic nervous system delta-Conotoxins are a family of small, disulfide-rich peptides found in the venoms of predatory cone snails (Conus). We examined in detail the effects of delta-conotoxin PVIA from the fish hunting cone snail Conus purpurascens on sodium currents in dissociated sympathetic neurons from the leopard frog Rana pipiens. We also compared this toxin's effects with those of delta-conotoxin SVIE from Conus striatus, another piscivorous cone snail. d-PVIA slowed the time-course of inactivation of delta sodium currents and shifted the voltage-dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation to more hyperpolarized potentials. Similar, albeit more pronounced, effects were seen with d-SVIE. While the effects of d-PVIA were reversed by washing, those of d-SVIE were largely irreversible over the time-course of these experiments. The effects of d-PVIA could be suppressed by conditioning depolarizations in a voltage- and time-dependent manner, whereas the effects of d-SVIE were largely resistant to conditioning depolarizations. Last, in intact sympathetic nervous system preparations, d-PVIA inhibited evoked trains of compound action potentials. Many of these effects of d-PVIA and d-SVIE are remarkably similar to those of toxins that bind to site 3 on voltage-gated sodium channels.",Excluded
4070,"Reduced somatosensory hand representation in thalidomide-induced dysmelia as revealed by fMRI The concept of cerebral plasticity suggests that the hand representation in somatosensory cortex is abnormal in congenital malformation disorders. To investigate this issue we studied 11 subjects with different degrees of upper extremity dysmelia due to thalidomide embryopathy in comparison to 10 control subjects. In the affected subjects fingers are typically missing in radio-ulnar order beginning with the thumb. Haemodynamic responses to electrical stimulation of the radial-most and ulnar-most fingers were measured in each subject using functional magnetic resonance tomography. The size of the hand area in the primary somatosensory cortex was estimated by calculating the Euclidian distance between corresponding activation peaks on the lateral postcentral gyrus. The cortical somatosensory hand representation was found to be significantly smaller in dysmelic subjects as compared with the control subjects (P <0.001). The shrinkage of the hand area was not proportional to the number of missing fingers. Furthermore, the cortical representation of the ulnar fingers in the dysmelic subjects was shifted towards the cortical thumb representation of the control group. We suggest that the unproportional reduction of the hand area together with the observed shift may reflect use-dependent rather than malformation-induced reorganization of the somatosensory hand area.",Excluded

For this purpose, pregnant F344 rats were given a single administration of N-ethylnitrosourea (ENU) on gestational day 18. A total of 500 pups were divided into five groups, each composed of 50 males and 50 females: Group 1, untreated controls; Group 2, ENU alone; Groups 3 to 5, ENU + EMF (sham exposure and two exposure levels). A 1.95-GHz wide-band code division multiple access (W-CDMA) signal, which is a feature of the International Mobile Telecommunication 2000 (IMT-2000) cellular system was employed for exposure of the rat head starting from 5 weeks of age, 90 min a day, 5 days a week, for 104 weeks.

The incidence and numbers of brain tumors in female rats exposed to 1.95-GHz W-CDMA signals showed tendencies to increase but without statistical significance. Overall, no significant increase in incidences or numbers, either in the males or females, was detected in the EMF-exposed groups. In addition, no clear changes in tumor types in the brain were evident. Thus, under the present experimental conditions, exposure of heads of rats to 1.95-GHz W-CDMA signals for IMT-2000 for a 2-year period was not demonstrated to accelerate or otherwise affect ENU-initiated brain tumorigenesis.",Excluded

3887,"Maturation of firing pattern in chick vestibular nucleus neurons The principal cells of the chick tangential nucleus are vestibular nucleus neurons participating in the vestibuloocular and vestibulocollic reflexes. In birds and mammals, spontaneous and stimulus-evoked firing of action potentials is essential for vestibular nucleus neurons to generate mature vestibular reflex activity. The emergence of spike-firing pattern and the underlying ion channels were studied in morphologically-identified principal cells using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from brain slices of late-term embryos (embryonic day 16) and hatchling chickens (hatching day 1 and hatching day 5). Spontaneous spike activity emerged around the perinatal period, since at embryonic day 16 none of the principal cells generated spontaneous action potentials. However, at hatching day 1, 50% of the cells fired spontaneously (range, 3 to 32 spikes/s), which depended on synaptic transmission in most cells. By hatching day 5, 80% of the principal cells could fire action potentials spontaneously (range, 5 to 80 spikes/s), and this activity was independent of synaptic transmission and showed faster kinetics than at hatching day 1. Repetitive firing in response to depolarizing pulses appeared in the principal cells starting around embryonic day 16, when <20% of the neurons fired repetitively. However, almost 90% of the principal cells exhibited repetitive firing on depolarization at hatching day 1, and 100% by hatching day 5. From embryonic day 16 to hatching day 5, the gain for evoked spike firing increased almost 10-fold. At hatching day 5, a persistent sodium channel was essential for the generation of spontaneous spike activity, while a small conductance, calcium-dependent potassium current modulated both the spontaneous and evoked spike firing activity. Altogether, these in vitro studies showed that during the perinatal period, the principal cells switched from displaying no spontaneous spike activity at resting membrane potential and generating one spike on depolarization to the tonic firing of spontaneous and evoked action potentials.",Excluded

However, the functional significance of these polymorphic variants in altering cell processes such as cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, and apoptosis is uncertain. We have cloned the XPD variants Lys751Gln, Asp312Asn, and Lys751Gln-Asp312Asn into a pcDNA-3.1-expression vector. Using these constructs, we did not find any detectable difference in either in vitro binding with wild-type p53 or in DNA repair proficiency as measured by host cell reactivation assay. We then genotyped 34 different lymphoblastoid cell lines from six Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humaine (CEPH)/Utah pedigree families and a CEPH/French pedigree family for polymorphisms at codons 751 and 312 and assessed their apoptotic response after either UV or ionized radiation exposure. The lymphoblastoid cell lines with homozygous or heterozygous Asp at codon 312 have similar apoptotic rates, whereas cell lines with homozygous Asn at codon 312 showed a 2.5-fold increased response to UV (P = 0.005; Student's t test). This is the first report known to us of a functional polymorphism in a gene involved in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. However, the presence of Lys or Gln at codon 751 did not influence the apoptotic response to UV. The diminished apoptotic response of cells containing the 312 Asp allele could both allow the survival and selective clonal expansion of carcinogen-damaged cells and be a mechanistic explanation for the increased risk of cancer at diverse tissue sites.",Excluded

However, concerns have been raised about potential long-term side effects, including cerebrovascular events (CVEs) and secondary intracranial tumors.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the risk of CVEs, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality in irradiated (IRR) NFPA patients, compared with NFPA patients who were not irradiated (non-IRR).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The study cohort included 806 patients with a NFPA from the Dutch National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults, a nationwide long-term surveillance study in severe GH-deficient adult patients. IRR patients (n = 456) were compared with non-IRR patients (n = 350).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CVEs, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality were measured.RESULTS: Sixty-nine subjects developed a CVE. In men, but not in women, the incidence of a CVE was significantly higher in IRR patients than in non-IRR patients (hazard ratio 2.99, 95% confidence interval 1.31-6.79). A secondary intracranial tumor developed in five IRR patients and two non-IRR patients. After adjustment for age, radiotherapy was not associated with mortality.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of secondary intracranial tumors and mortality did not differ between IRR and non-IRR patients. However, a CVE was found significantly more frequently in IRR men but not in women. Further research into the long-term effects of cranial radiotherapy seems mandatory. The potential risks of radiotherapy have to be taken into account when radiotherapy is considered in NFPA patients, and long-term follow-up is recommended.",Included
